		<shortDescription>Star Power Carries the Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both versions of Hitchcock's "The Man Who Knew Too Much" have their strong points, and are well worth watching. This 1950's remake is carried mostly by its star power, with Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day being convincing and very sympathetic as the parents of the kidnapped child. It also has more lavish settings and better (not just because it is color) photography than the earlier version. On the other hand, it lacks the wittiness of the British version, and moves more slowly.The remake spends much more time setting up the story than the original did, with the family spending a lot of time on their vacation in Morocco before the crisis occurs. It makes possible some colorful scenery and settings, and allows you to get to know the family a bit more, although the quicker pace in the original established more tension and kept your attention throughout. The Albert Hall sequence works well in both films, with this one having the added bonus of allowing the audience to see Bernard Herrmann, who wrote so many great scores for Hitchcock's films, conducting the orchestra.Despite having essentially the same story, the two versions of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" have a much different feel. Which one you prefer is largely a matter of taste - while neither is usually considered among Hitchcock's very best, they are both good movies with a lot of strong points. Take a look at both if you have the chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original The Man Who Knew Too Much brought Alfred Hitchcock acclaim for the first time outside of the United Kingdom. Of course part of the reason for the acclaim was that folks marveled how Hitchcock on such a skimpy budget as compared to lavish Hollywood products was able to provide so much on the screen. The original film was shot inside a studio.For whatever reason he chose this of all his films to remake, Hitchcock now with an international reputation and a big Hollywood studio behind him (Paramount)decided to see what The Man Who Knew Too Much would be like with a lavish budget. This is shot on location in Marrakesh and London and has two big international names for box office. This was James Stewart's third of four Hitchcock films and his only teaming with Doris Day and her only Hitchcock film.I do wonder why Hitchcock never used Doris again. At first glance she would fit the profile of blond leading ladies that Hitchcock favored. Possibly because her wholesome screen image was at odds with the sophistication Hitchcock also wanted in his blondes. Doris does some of her best acting ever in The Man Who Knew Too Much. Her best scene is when her doctor husband James Stewart gives her a sedative before telling her their son has been kidnapped by an English couple who befriended them in Morocco. Stewart and Day play off each other beautifully in that scene. But Doris especially as she registers about four different emotions at once. Day and Stewart are on vacation with their son Christopher Olsen in Morocco and they make the acquaintance of Frenchman Daniel Gelin and the aforementioned English couple, Bernard Miles and Brenda DaBanzie. Gelin is stabbed in the back at a market place in Marrakesh and whispers some dying words to Stewart about an assassination to take place in Albert Hall in London. Their child is snatched in order to insure their silence.For the only time I can think of a hit song came out of a Hitchcock film. Doris in fact plays a noted singer who retired from the stage to be wife and mother. The song was Que Sera Sera and I remember it well at the age of 9. You couldn't go anywhere without hearing it in 1956, it even competed with the fast rising Elvis Presley that year. Que Sera Sera won the Academy Award for Best Song beating out such titles as True Love from High Society and the title song from Around the World in 80 Days. It became Doris Day's theme song for the rest of her life and still is should she ever want to come back.In fact the song is worked quite nicely into the plot as Doris sings it at an embassy party at the climax.Instead of doing it with mirrors, Hitchcock shot the assassination scene at the real Albert Hall and like another reviewer said it's not directed, it's choreographed. You'll be hanging on your seats during that moment.This was remake well worth doing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Under-rated suspense masterwork.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you start watching the 1956 version of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, you'll think it's a minor work by Alfred Hitchcock. The countless scenes showing a lovely, but buffoonish vacationing American couple (James Stewart, Doris Day) seem to lead nowhere. But, hold on, about thirty minutes into the film, during a very dreamlike murder sequence (which takes place in bright sunlight, and involves blue paint) the film really takes off. Personally, I find the opening "character development" sequence between protagonists James Stewart and Doris Day very charming. It sets you up for the second and third acts of the film. You get to like this couple so much, you are raelly rooting for them as they try to rescue their kidnapped son amidst a plot to assassinate a visiting diplomat. Of course, the high-point of the film is the assassination itself, a twelve minute wordless sequence. Hitchcock beautifully brings us back to silent film! The ending, which involves a rescue at an embassy, is wonderfully silly and tense. For those not familiar with Hitchcock, this is Hitchcock's own remake of a film he made under the same title in 1934 in England. This is one of my favorite Hitchcock films. It's proof that this master loved his audience and wanted to keep them thrilled!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The master of thrills delivers another thrilling masterwork....almost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's more assured telling of a film he made twenty-one years earlier is infinitely superior to the original. Hitchcock said himself that his first version was the work of an amateur, and although it certainly isn't a bad film, he does appear to be right. That being said, this remake, although definitely better, still isn't among Hitchcock's best work. That's certainly not to say that it isn't good, it's just more than a little overindulgent, and that drags it down. Hitchcock seems all too keen to drag certain elements out, and these are parts of the film that aren't entirely relevant to the plot, which can become annoying. Some of these dragged out sequences, such as the one that sees James Stewart and Doris Day eating in a Moroccan restaurant are good because it helps establish the different culture that our American protagonists have found themselves in, but for every restaurant scene, there's an opera sequence and it's the latter that make the film worse.The plot follows a middle-aged doctor and his wife that go to Morocco for a holiday with their young son. While there, they meet a French man on the bus and another middle-aged couple in a restaurant. However, things go awry when the French man dies from a knife in the back, shortly after whispering something to the doctor. The holiday then turns into a full blown nightmare when the couple's son is kidnapped, which causes them to cut it short and go to London in order to try and find him. The film has a very potent degree of paranoia about it, and it manages to hold this all the way through. In fact, I would even go as far as to say that this is the most paranoid film that Hitchcock ever made. Like most of Hitchcock's films, this one is very thrilling and keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire duration, with only the aforementioned opera sequence standing out as a moment in which the tension is diffused. There is also more than a little humour in the movie, which gives lighthearted relief to the morbid goings on, and actually works quite well.The original version of this story was lent excellent support by the fantastic Peter Lorre. This film doesn't benefit from his presence, unfortunately, but that is made up for by performances from the amazing James Stewart, and Doris Day. James Stewart is a man that is always going to be a contender for the 'greatest actor of all time' crown. His collaborations with Hitchcock all feature mesmerising performances from him, and this one is no different. (Although his best performance remains the one in Mr Smith Goes to Washington). Stewart conveys all the courage, conviction and heartbreak of a man that has lost his child and would do anything to get him back brilliantly. In fact, that's one of the best things about this film; you are really able to feel for the couple's loss throughout and that serves in making it all the more thrilling. Doris Day, on the other hand, is a rather strange casting choice for this movie. She's definitely a good actress, but she's more associated with musicals and seeing her in a thriller is rather odd (even if she does get to flex her vocal chords a little).As I've mentioned; this is not Hitchcock's best film, but there's much to enjoy about it and although I'd recommend many Hitchcock films before recommending this one, I'll definitely give it two thumbs up as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the trademark Hitchcock elements are in place yet again, for a wonderful example of crowd-pleasing from the man who knew better than anyone just how to work an audience. James Stewart, everyone's perfect everyman returns to familiar ground, with the perfect wife (Doris Day, perfect casting), and perfect family. Into this chocolate box world is thrown some dangerous information, and a downward spiral of kidnap and murder.As usual, there are the elaborately staged set-pieces, and the intimate psychoanalysis that you would expect. Here, the assassination sequence in the Royal Albert Hall provides the former - a beautifully choreographed blend of music and images building to the pivotal crash of cymbals, and the scenes in Morocco the latter, as our couple become obliviously embroiled in international espionage. It is hard to find fault with any of Hitchcock's contrivances (using the Oscar-winning 'Whatever Will Be' as a plot device to get Doris singing is almost too much, but forgivable), and the the whole cast are superb, giving incredibly naturalistic performances - see the scene in the Moroccan restaurant, which almost seems ad-libbed.One of Hitchcock's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thrilling climax at London's Royal Albert Hall...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people have the irritating habit of dying before completing a vital message, thus confusing the hero, not to mention the audience...Dr. Ben McKenna (James Stewart) and his wife Jo, a former musical star (Doris Day) are vacationing in Morocco with their son, Hank (Christopher Olsen), when they meet Mr. and Mrs. Drayton, a British couple (Brenda de Banzie and Bernard Miles). They are also befriended by a charming Frenchman, Louis Bernard (Daniel Gelin), who invites them to dinner but then cancels at the last minute...The MacKennas go to a restaurant and end up having their meal with the Draytons, when they spot Louis Bernard... The next day in the market place, they are caught in an assassination intrigue... While they are wandering in the local market, the crowds suddenly scatter to reveal an Arab fleeing from his pursuers... Dr. McKenna stands amazed as the Arab falls into his arms, a knife sticking out of his back... Gulping his last breath, the dying man mutters some words and collapses... Dr. McKenna is completely taken aback when the Arab's hood falls from his head and he is revealed as Bernard in disguise... McKenna is left knowing too little, but as far as the assassins are concerned, too much...To prevent Dr. McKenna from revealing what he knows, the conspirators kidnap his son as a hostage... The film is primarily concerned with the dilemma of kidnapping?how to get the little boy back safely... The subplot about the assassination is just the setup...The film is a breathless escapade... The death of Bernard comes suddenly and points out that death comes when we least expect it... Stewart is charged with emotion as the Midwestern doctor, accidentally involved in political intrigue... His perceptive facial expressions and indignant delivery made him convincingly human?a person we could easily identify with... It is his temperament that actually sets the pace for the entire film... By 1956, the lovely Doris Day had won increasing esteem as an actress as well as a singer... She had been particularly strong opposite James Cagney in the Ruth Etting's biopic, 'Love Me or Leave Me,' but she was still unsure of her basic Thespian talents...The casting of character actor Reggie Malder as the assassin, is brilliant... The man looks like a menace and his effusive portrayal radiates evil...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike most people I actually feel that "The Man?" is at its strongest in the Morocco sequences at the beginning of the film (particularly the wonderful restaurant sequence much of which seems have been ad-libbed but probably wasn't). Once the son of Stewart and Day has been kidnapped and they fly to London, the film becomes messy although the Albert Hall sequence is admittedly well executed.Most of my criticisms of the film revolve around the plot (not to mention Day's interminable singing of Que Sera Sera), such as why does Louis Bernard (when he is dying) not tell James Stewart about the English couple (Mr &amp; Mrs Drayton) but only tell them the name of the chapel in London where they live? I suppose the answer is because Stewart and Day would not have allowed Mrs Drayton to then take their son and there would have been no kidnap and no film. Also, the information that Stewart has about the assassination ceases to be important once he and Day confront the Draytons at the chapel and Day calls the police. At that point in the film Stewart has actually passed on everything he knows to the police, i.e. the name of the chapel and the fact that someone will be assassinated. Why do the kidnappers still need his son? He has nothing left to say.With regard to the chapel itself, there is the ridiculous confusion regarding the name Ambrose Chapel. Any right thinking person would realise it is a place and not a person. Yet Stewart thinks Ambrose Chapel is a person and amazingly manages to find the name listed in the telephone directory (doctors in Indiana obviously don't have to be too bright). The film then goes through the pointless confrontation at the Taxidermists between Stewart and TWO men named Ambrose Chapel ? how stupid.Notwithstanding these problems "The Man?" is a decent film. Stewart puts in a very good performance (as always) and there are some nice scenes but this is well short of Hitchcock's best films and even some of his less regarded films such as "Rope". I haven't seen the original 1934 version of "The Man?" so I don't know how it compares to the 1956 remake. The general consensus is that the remake is far superior ? if that's true I don't think I'll be rushing out to see the original any time soon, even if it does star Peter Lorre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not one of my favorite Hitchcock movies, but worth seeing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure why I didn't have a more enthusiastic reaction to The Man Who Knew Too Much. Hitchcock is the director that got me interested in classic cinema, and Rear Window, Notorious, Psycho, The Birds, Rebecca, and The Lady Vanishes are all among my favorite movies. It's a globe-trotting adventure with all the tension, intrigue, assassinations, conspiracies, and suspense you could want, but there's something about it that just didn't really catch my interest until the last 30 minutes, or so. The ending is great, but the rest of the movie was just missing something, in my opinion.&nbsp;The problem certainly wasn't with the two lead actors. James Stewart gave another great performance under Hitchcock's eye (he was my favorite Hitchcock leading man), and Doris Day was charmingly determined and convincing as a confused wife &nbsp;and mother, desperately searching for her son.&nbsp;The Man Who Knew Too Much certainly isn't a bad movie (is there such a thing as a bad Hitchcock movie?), and I expect that other people might have a more favorable response to it than I did. I suspect this is just one of those times when a good film just doesn't completely "click", with me, for whatever reason. I recommend it to anyone who is interested, though.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the famous twelve-minute sequence at the Albert Hall alone is enough to demand an audience for this richly entertaining thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1956, Alfred Hitchcock owed a film to Paramount Studios and was given the task of remaking not just any film, but one of his own. That film was his 1934 movie "The Man Who Knew Too Much" which starred Leslie Banks and Edna Best as vacationing parents who unwillingly become involved in an international espionage involving an assassination plot. In order to keep their mouths shut, foreign spies kidnap their daughter and hold her hostage. Hitchcock was in no particular hurry to tell the same story again, but he did owe Paramount a movie and proceeded to do it again. But like a professional, he did not simply tell the same story. He used the same plot and circumstances, but generated a newer, better film with a fresher story from his 1934 hit. This time casting the always competent James Stewart and the lovely Doris Day as the vacationing parents and having a son ? not daughter ?being kidnapped, Hitchcock created one of his most underrated films that I think deserves to be placed alongside his lists of masterpieces.This was the third of the four movies that Hitchcock made with James Stewart and this is the one that is the least dark and the most free-spirited. It is not a dark, twisted movie like "Vertigo" or "Rear Window" nor is it as good as the said features, but it's one of the director's most thoroughly enjoyable movies. It takes a serious tone, but also has carefully placed moments of comedy that do generate laughs. Hitchcock was a gifted and versatile filmmaker who has entries in his filmography that should accommodate for all mainstreams in the audience. And for those who just want Hitchcock as an exciting, adventurous level, this is the movie I recommend.Part of the reason why I enjoy this more than the original is that I like the parents in the movie more. We get more three-dimensional development from them this time and we sense the struggle to find their son and possibly save a diplomat's life if they can. The movie is held up by the performances by James Stewart and Doris Day. This is the least dark Stewart was in the four movies he had with Hitchcock and it's probably the most conventional performances he did for the Master of Suspense, but nevertheless a very good one. He is totally believably and competent as the frantic, but cool-headed father in love with his family. But what shocks me so much is that in reviews, people oftentimes overlook Doris Day, who I think is just as good as Jimmy Stewart. I'm enthralled by the enthusiasm and the energy that she puts behind her performance. Yes, Day is beautiful, but she's also a more than competent actress who carries out her scenes, especially her emotionally and distressful ones with absolute perfection.If there is a weakness in the movie, it does relate to the villains whom we don't see very often, but that's part of what makes this movie work. Because we don't see the villains often, we sympathize and follow the parents played by Stewart and Day better than if we toggled frequently between both sides. Hitchcock always liked to play against conventions and it shows here. That's another one of the minor differences this has from the original, which did jump between parties more often.And if you're seeking Alfred Hitchcock performing his art of suspense?you will find it here, never you fear. Hitchcock believed in a theory called pure cinema, in which you did not need sound or dialogue, merely images to generate any emotion. And there is one very famous scene in this movie taking place at the Royal Albert Hall in London, which proves this theory. Hitchcock tells us what to look for ? but not the protagonists ? and this builds up tension that can go on for as long as he wants to. The scene goes on for twelve minutes ? twelve minutes ? and every moment of it is sheer suspense coupled with powerful emotion. And there's no dialogue. The sound is dominated by the music. It's very much like watching a silent movie. And it's the most powerful scene in the picture.The original "The Man With No Name" is one of the most interesting examples of Hitchcock's career as an amateur, but the remake, done by a professional, is vastly superior and infinitely entertaining. If I do have a complaint, it's the last thirty seconds of the movie which wrap up a little suddenly, but the previous two hours were so much fun I easily forgive that and enthusiastically shell out my highest rating. "The Man With No Name" is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most entertaining pictures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake Is Entertaining, But Not Deep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock saw this remake of his 1934 film as a more professional job, and thus an improvement. It's certainly more polished, and pitched for maximum audience engagement, yet also a tad off the high standard the Master was setting for himself by the 1950s.Dr. McKenna (James Stewart) and his wife Jo (Doris Day) are vacationing with their boy in Marrakesh when they become witnesses both to a murder and to a secret so dangerous their boy is kidnapped to secure their silence. Can they save their child by themselves? And will they be able to prevent the crime from happening without costing their son his life?It's tough to discuss this movie, since so much that happens in it is better seen for the first time with minimal foreknowledge. Rest assured that there are some fine setpieces on display, and that Hitchcock is indeed very clever with his camera and his way of building suspense.Yet the film seems less than completely successful. For one thing, there's an unusually slow build-up, almost a Hitchcock loyalty test, in the first thirty minutes of the film, with some particularly strained bits of comedy around a Moroccan restaurant. There are more than the usual number of plot holes and improbable coincidences on display here.The biggest problem I have are with the two leads. While Day shows us she can be more than a perky comedienne in her more demanding scenes, both she and Stewart seem uncomfortable in their roles. The McKennas appear at times to be a singularly unhappy couple: he a domineering type who doesn't like the fact his wife was a famous singer known by something other than his last name; she a paranoid hysteric prone to winding her husband up unnecessarily. The idea of their domestic misery is gently presented ("Ben, are we about to have our monthly fight?") and then just as quickly abandoned, ironically after a scene where he arguably pulls a rather cruel stunt to keep her in line.I'm not sure if this George-and-Martha-type film would have been better than the one I actually saw, but it would give us more of a rooting interest in the McKennas getting their act together while saving their son. Here, in the main, they are played so squarely they seem more likely to hail from Disneyland than Indianapolis.But give the second hour credit for being one of Hitchcock's best. It could have used a bit more humor, but there's ample misdirection and a mischievous spirit guiding the proceedings. Add to that one of the great climaxes of any suspense film here, ironically not a climax here but a set up for another which is almost as good. The villains are appropriately seedy, if lacking the menacing charm of Peter Lorre in the 1934 version.If you are a fan of Doris Day or her hit song "Que Sera, Sera," you may enjoy this film even more than I did. As a Hitchcock enthusiast, I was entertained enough not to mind the feeling of shallowness. Hitchcock was a master of surfaces as well as depth; you get a riveting example of the former here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock shows originality in the remake of his own 1934 British film, "The Man Who Knew Too Much". This 1956 take on the same story is much lighter than the previous one. Mr. Hitchcock was lucky in having collaborators that went with him from one film to the next, thus keeping a standard in his work. Robert Burks did an excellent job with the cinematography and George Tomasini's editing shows his talent. Ultimately, Bernard Herrmann is seen conducting at the magnificent Royal Albert Hall in London at the climax of the picture.James Stewart was an actor that worked well with Mr. Hitchcock. In this version, he plays a doctor from Indiana on vacation with his wife and son. When we meet him, they are on their way to Marrakesh in one local bus and the intrigue begins. His wife is the lovely Doris Day at her best. She had been a well known singer before her marriage and now is the perfect wife and mother. The film has some good supporting cast, Brenda DeBanzie, Bernard Miles, Daniel Gelin, Alan Mowbray, among others, do a great job in portraying their characters.Although this is a "light Hitchcock", one can't dismiss it as a failure. "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is a change of pace for Hitchcock's fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>weak Hitchcock flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when I had convinced myself that Alfred Hitchcock didn't make any clunkers during the fifties, I decided to watch 'The Man Who Knew Too Much." Maybe 'clunker' is too strong a word, but this is definitely one of Hitchcock's lesser films. It is ponderous, with phony suspense, ill-placed humor, and Doris Day singing 'Que Sera, Sera'... twice. There are, to be sure, some typical Hitchcock touches, but not enough to sustain this overblown two-hour melodrama. Which is really what it feels like, more than the thriller or international intrigue it was meant to be. James Stewart is fine in the lead; his performance is better than the material. It would be easy to say Doris Day is overwrought in her portrayal, but again, it is really the script that fails her. I don't know that any other actress could have done better. The film veers from feverishly serious to clumsily comedic, often in the same scene. A problem here is the subject matter. All parents' worst nightmare is the thought of their young child being kidnapped and placed in danger, and that is exactly what happens. Stewart and Day go from being greatly worried one moment to making silly banter the next, and it just doesn't work. Day in fact often has a confused look on her face as though she doesn't know HOW she's supposed to react. The climactic scene in the Royal Albert Hall is beautiful to look at, and provides the added treat of having famed film composer Bernard Herrman actually conduct the orchestra, but as a suspense setpiece, it is completely ineffective. The scenes following it not only feel superfluous, but during the second rousing rendition of 'Que Sera, Sera,' are also almost unbearably interminable. The standing-around and emotional handwringing in this movie really grow quite tedious. (When the boy starts whistling from upstairs, you'd think nothing could stop Stewart from running up to free him, but no, he just stands there impatiently, decorum apparently demanding he wait till the end of the song.) 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' just goes to prove that even a Master sometimes comes up short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock! - The Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film that tends to get buried under prejudice and preconception - It's a remake! Doris Day is in it! She sings! - Hitchcock's second crack at 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' is his most under-rated film, and arguably a fully fledged masterpiece in its own right.This is, in more ways than one, Doris Day's film. Not only does she give the finest performance of her career, more than holding her own against James Stewart, but the whole film is subtly structured around her character rather than his. This is, after all, a film in which music is both motif and plot device. What better casting than the most popular singer of her generation? Consider: Day's Jo McKenna has given up her career on the stage in order to settle down with her husband and raise their son. This seems to be a mutual decision, and she doesn't appear to be unhappy. But look at the way Stewart teases her in the horse-drawn carriage over her concerns about Louis Bernard, implying that she is jealous that Bernard wasn't asking her any questions about her career. This is clearly a recurrent joke between them - she responds with a 'har-de-har-har' that denotes the familiarity of this gag, suggesting that she has a certain latent resentment about her confinement, and that they both realise it.After their son has been kidnapped, Stewart insists on doping her before giving her the news. This is a cruel scene, brilliantly played by both actors, which illustrates the power imbalance in their marriage - he is seeking to control and subdue her reactions, in essence using his professional knowledge to suppress her voice in the marriage just as his medical career has suppressed her singing career.The potency of that voice is demonstrated in the Ambrose Chapel sequence, when she has to reign in its highly trained clarity and volume to blend in with the congregation of female drudges - they almost act as a warning of what will become of her if she continues to suppress her talent. At the Albert Hall, it is her need to cry out, to exercise those impressive lungs, that saves a man's life, and in the Embassy finale, it is her talent and reputation that allows them to locate their son. By contrast, all of Stewart's masculine activity is counterproductive - his visit to the taxidermist is a dead end, he gets left behind at the church whilst everyone else moves on to the Albert Hall, and his efforts there only succeed in getting the assassin killed, thus depriving the Police of potentially useful information. It is only when his action is joined to his wife's voice, in the rescue of Hank from the embassy, that he actually succeeds in doing something useful.Far from being forced into the film to give Day an opportunity to sing, 'Que Sera Sera' acts as the first musical device in the film, foreshadowing the nightmare that is about to engulf the McKennas; 'the future's not ours to see' indeed. It also neatly prepares the way for the finale, in which the close bond mother and son share through music will allow Doris to save the day.The most famous sequence in the film makes music the central feature - the build up to the assassination attempt in the Albert Hall. This lengthy wordless sequence may be the single most extraordinary thing Hitchcock committed to film, the ultimate expression of his belief that films should be stories told visually. We see people conduct conversations in this sequence, but we never hear a word they say. We don't need to - the images say everything. It is also his most exquisite suspense sequence, with the pieces moving slowly into place as the music builds. The editing is incredibly tight, matched to the music perfectly. There isn't a frame out of place - anything that doesn't relate directly to the assassination is giving the viewer a sense of the environment, the geography in which all this is playing out. It builds slowly, but by the end the suspense is nearly unbearable. When Jo screams, it isn't just a relief for her, but for the audience.The Ambrose Chapel sequence is witty, and particularly effective for anyone who has had to sit through a service at a particularly stick-in-the-mud Nonconformist church. The Embassy sequence seems a little flat after the Albert Hall one that preceded it on first viewing, but second time around actually seems more effective, with the final walk at gunpoint really benefiting from the gorgeous use of Day singing in the background, reminiscent of the music-as-ambient-noise in 'Rear Window'. The score as a whole is subtle, allowing the music from on-screen sources to be foregrounded effectively.Bernard Miles is a low-key villain, a little banal, but with a dry wit. He's outshone by Brenda de Banzie as his wife, who walks a fine line between sinister and sympathetic. Just look at the way she smokes a cigarette whilst her husband preps the assassin - her stance is pure gangster's moll, belying the Middle-England exterior, but she clearly has a soft side, and possibly maternal feelings towards Hank.Stewart is excellent, although if Hitchcock really did always cast him as 'Everyman', as the Director's daughter seems to think, then it confirms that Hitchcock had a cynical view of his audience. Stewart played a hypocritical intellectual who espoused fascist ideology in Rope, a voyeur who mistreated his girlfriend in Rear Window and an obsessive necrophiliac in Vertigo. Day is nothing short of phenomenal. Just look at her reaction to the news that her son has been kidnapped - she never overdoes anything, but neither does she sell it short. This is one of Hitchcock's most emotionally effective films. He never lets us forget what the stakes are for the McKennas; they feel the most fully human of all his central characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Highly Entertaining Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many reviewers seem to prefer the original version of The Man Who Knew Too Much, which I have not had the opportunity to view. By itself, the '56 version is a very well done film. The run of mid-to-late fifties Hitchcock films (including "Rear Window", "Dial M For Murder", "Vertigo", and "To Catch A Thief", as well as this film) is one of my favorite periods in his career. In The Man Who Knew Too Much, Jimmy Stewart throws himself vigorously into his role as always. Doris Day is very believable in the role of an atypical Hitchcock blond. I thought there was nothing fake about her performance. Her character may not have been written as strongly as the original, but she's definitely not reduced to the role of a passive, "Yes, dear", pretty thing on Jimmy Stewart's arm.There were some really clever lines written for Hank (the couple's son who later gets kidnapped) in the opening scene on the bus- it's too bad Christopher Olsen read them so woodenly. It's rare to see a good performance from a child actor in the 50s, though. Most of the rest of the supporting actors in this film were very competent, though- most notably the assassin (played by Reggie Nalder). Some little touches that make this film undeniably Hitchcockian- the use of non-English dialog, especially French (something Hitch did on a much larger scale in "To Catch A Thief"); the use of foreboding, Arabic music in the hotel when the assassin appears; Stewart and Day talking to each other in the church, singing their words to the tune of the hymn; the Albert Hall scene, specifically showing the musicians and the assassin's accomplice following the score, building up tension, as well as the percussionist getting the cymbals ready; and finally the assassin's gun as it appears from behind the curtain. It moves so slowly and precisely that it must have been done mechanically (an effect Hitch used at the end of "Spellbound", also).All in all, The Man Who Knew Too Much is a fun film to watch. It's not as deep or as heavily laden with symbolism as some of his films ("Vertigo", "Strangers on a Train"), but all the same it is one of my top five Hitchcock masterpieces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A weak Hitchcock-movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recap: A vacationing couple with a kid get mixed up in a plot of murder. While in Marrakech they meet a mysterious man that eventually get murdered, but not before giving them a clue to an assassination plot in London. But before they can go to police their son get kidnapped, and now they have to stop the murder in order to save their son.Comments: It's a nice crime/mystery story. Just a few clues, that leads ever onward. Another step to solve it but time is limited. That's not the problem. The problem is everything surrounding the crime story.James Stewart and especially Doris Day plays good. But I don't buy them as a couple. There is no connection there, no emotion. And if I am to really care about them saving this boy, to really buy into the story on more than a casual level, I need to believe that they really care. And I don't.I don't really feel their emotional connection, they seem distant and almost uncaring of each other. The only thing that seem to connect them is their son, and hardly that. And even if it is the crime story that drives the movie forward it is the emotional connection that should be in the family that should really catch the viewer and drag them in. I didn't feel that, and for me this never got past a casual movie. The crime story never got that interesting as it never seemed that important.To really emphasize that is how the murder story is handled. You never get any whys, and hardly not even the who. Why is the McKenna's chosen in the beginning? Why is the would be assassins hanging around in Marrakech anyway? And we certainly don't get any conclusion. The story ends very abruptly when the son is rescued (yeah, major spoiler but are you surprised?). That tells me that this wasn't about the crime really, but about the family. And as I said before, I don't believe in them.Supposedly a Hitchcock classic. But not one of his better ones, in my opinion. The intrigue is not complex enough, deep enough, and there is not enough other reasons to care.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock strikes again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if this is Hitchcock's worst film but it comes close. Much of it is so terrible one actually feels embarrassed for the actors. It is as if Hitchcock deliberately wanted to make them look bad. One scene that stands out in particular is when James Stewart climbs out of the bell tower at the church. It is hard to imagine a clumsier sight than this; plus it makes his character seem particularly stupid. Another scene is when the little boy is told to whistle in order to attract his mother's attention. This is so contrived as to make one shudder in disbelief. Finally, there is the matter of Doris Day. She simply is not believable in a so-called serious role, and her constant whining of "Que Sera Sera" eventually makes one want to throw rocks at the TV. But Hitchcock was probably so bored by re-making one of his lesser British films he just didn't care how ridiculous all of this was. So he struck back at the audience, then took the money and ran!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet again, IMDb needs the genre "Farce"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was given an old DVD of The Man Who Knew Too Much and eagerly took it home expecting another great Hitchcock thriller. Well, thriller this is NOT!! It is a farce! In fact, had it been so categorised, I would probably have watched it with a totally different mindset and this review might have read quite differently.The whole story is farcically unbelievable. OK, I know it is a remake of an older movie, but it had obviously been updated as evidenced by the cars and aircraft shown in it. I cannot believe that Scotland Yard Special Branch police officers were ever as incompetent as portrayed here. In fact, I'm surprised that there wasn't an official complaint from "The Yard" to Mr Hitchcock for showing them thus in what was supposed to be a serious thriller.The story is unbelievable and, as another reviewer has already written, an insult to high calibre actors such as Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day. (Is there any record of their embarrassment at being sucked into this?). The cameo by Richard Wattis (a one-time very funny British actor) may have given anyone looking at the cast an inkling that this was a farce but then, when he actually appeared, he wasn't cast in a funny part at all. Come to think of it, apart from the ridiculousness of the plot as a whole, there wasn't one funny part in the entire film! What genre would that make it? "Serious farce"??One thing I must say though, is that Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day displayed amazing composure for parents whose only child was kidnapped in, of all places, Morocco. I doubt that ANY mother would almost happily pop off to England without any idea where her little boy was and then, on arrival, calmly entertain friends making a lame excuse that she had to "pop out for a few minutes" and asking them to entertain themselves and wait for her soon return. People in her situation don't behave that way and it is insulting for filmmakers to expect their audiences to accept it.A big disappointment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock remake is far superior to his earlier '34 version...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It does happen, once in awhile, that a remake emerges as a far better film than the original, which is true of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, which not only changes many of the plot twists but also changes the setting to a more exotic one in Morocco.The script is much more detailed and wittier than the original, giving charismatic roles to JAMES STEWART and DORIS DAY as the American husband and wife who learn about an assassination plot and then have to spend the rest of the story trying to rescue their son from the would be assassins.Not surprisingly, Day does get a chance to have her way with a song and in this case it's a good one, Que Sera, Sera, which went on to become a huge recording hit for her. But the musical sequence that dominates the film and provides its most climactic moment is the Albert Hall sequence using "Stormcloud Cantata" (with Bernard Herrmann conducting) and the famous symbols that are about to clash, timed with the assassin's shot.Photographed on location in gorgeous Technicolor, with a good score by Herrmann and an intelligent script by John Michael Hayes, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH is superior entertainment from "the master of suspense".Especially worth noting are the sinister performances by BRENDA de BANZIE and BERNARD MILES as the kidnappers and DANIEL GELIN as the man in the marketplace whose death puts the whole story into gear.Trivia note: Hitchcock himself called his early version "the work of an amateur" and got his wish to do a remake at a time when he was doing his best work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Handsome Hitchcock thriller, but far too doddering...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's remake of his own 1934 suspense-drama comes dangerously close to being an hysterical melodrama instead of a thriller, as The Master of Suspense is far too leisurely in working this convoluted plot up to a boil. American couple James Stewart and Doris Day (a convincing husband and wife) are swept up in an assassination plot while vacationing in Morocco, and are frantic when their young son is kidnapped. Despite Hitch's usual class and an exceptionally handsome production design, the film has few thrills. Scenes drag on interminably, the characters mumble and shoot terse looks at each other, but the threads of the story are kept far too opaque, and only the star-leads are able to hold interest. Doris introduces the big hit song "Whatever Will Be (Que Sera, Sera)", which serves as a plot-function and yet gets perhaps too much screen-time here. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a great film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just started "studying" Hitchcock films....I've seen "Psycho" and "Dial M for Murder"...with this film being the third in my quest of experiencing movie genius. This film, in my opinion, is like no other. I loved every minute of it. Although I at first got discouraged in the beginning as it was a little slow....things quickly picked up. The scene in the auditorium where the assassination is attemped is simply marvelous. With the live music playing, and the filming excellent; I think this is one of the most exciting, best filmed scenes I've ever seen. Seeing his films today, what amazes me about Hitchcock more than anything is his ability to draw you into his films; without all the million-dollar technology that today's films have; which proves just how much substance there was to film in the past. The way he lets us into his films is just genius. And "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is no different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What would happen to you if you were in an alien country and your loved one gets lost. Hitchcock might have thought this and build the script.Profound in tension and thorough with suspense as any other Hitchcock film this one is a must watch for a few lessons on film making itself. First, how to bring tension to the mind of audience from nowhere is what Hitchcock hits upon. And if ever there was any importance for a song then this movie permeates a cut above the rest for it's usage of music and song.I cannot even think that any other director would have thought on earth that if we shoot a gun when the cymbals crash the noise of the trigger would not be heard and would be lost. Ah, that is what is Hitchcock is all about and shall continue to be.Okay, done with Hitchcock coming to the movie it's a tale of a couple whose child has been kidnapped in an alien country now they get him back forms the story. In the meanwhile, there are few characters of great importance who form the plot completely. The usage of music is so very important and poignant if for once it is used as a backdrop for a murder then it is also used for a mother to reclaim her child. The acting as expected is top notch. Screenplay is very good and so is editing. Above them all is the Hitchcock direction that takes a plot filled with anxieties to that filled with tension and suspense. It grows on gradually.Its 4/5 for a great Hitchcock film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very solid but not classic Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was of course a remake that Alfred Hitchcock made of one of his own movies. I haven't seen the earlier British version but I understand that this reworking follows the same basic plot-line but with a few differences, many of which were a result of the much higher budget at his disposal. It's a film that the director made at the height of his popularity. As a result, this is a very polished production indeed. Its story has an American family holidaying in Morocco becoming involved in a high level assassination plot. The father becomes privy to some highly confidential information and is transformed into the man who knew too much. As a result, his young son is kidnapped by way of insurance that he will not spill the beans; the action then relocates to London. In truth, this is a very by-the-numbers story and very typically Hitchcockian with its innocent man in the middle of a dangerous, suspenseful situation. It's because of the lack of surprises that this one isn't amongst his best work. Nevertheless, it remains a very well made thriller that allows Hitchcock to play to his established strengths without stretching himself very much.Regular Hitchcock actor James Stewart takes on the title role and is as reliable as you would expect. Doris Day is a less expected choice as his wife, as despite being blonde she doesn't exactly fit the image that his ice queen leading ladies mostly take. But, in fairness the role hardly calls for that and she accounts for herself very well and shows she had quite a bit more flexibility as an actress than is sometimes assumed ? although, admittedly, she does get a big scene where she sings 'Que Sera Sera' which feels a little forced in the context of this film though to be honest. Of additional note is the appearance of Reggie Nalder as the ominous hit-man. Nalder is a very threatening looking actor and was used likewise in later movies, most notably Dario Argento's 1970 thriller The Bird with the Crystal Plumage (it's probably no coincidence considering Argento was called the Italian Hitchcock back in those days). Once again, he is really good value here. His big scene happens in the Albert Hall finale, which is probably the best part of the film overall. It's a complex sequence of events played with no dialogue for 12 minutes. Very cinematic, very Hitchcock. We even see the soundtrack composer Bernard Herrmann appear as himself as the conductor. It's a very impressive sequence of events orchestrated with precision. Overall, though, I would not put The Man Who Knew Too Much near the top of Hitchcock's filmography, it's more a very solid and well-crafted film than an exceptional one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lesser But Enjoyable Hitchcock Thriller Of Kidnapping And Assassination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben and Josephine McKenna are on holiday in Morocco with their son Hank when they are befriended by a mysterious Frenchman, Louis Bernard. The very next day, Bernard is killed and Hank is kidnapped. Ben and Jo must travel to London, solve the murder, stop an assassination plot and rescue their son.To say The Man Who Knew Too Much is possibly the weakest of Hitchcock's films of the fifties (a toss-up with I Confess) is not so much a criticism of it as a reminder of how astonishingly brilliant his work during that decade was. It suffers only by comparison with such masterpieces as Rear Window and Vertigo; in its own right it's a fine exotic thriller. It has great suspense scenes (the service in Ambrose Chapel, the assassination attempt at the Albert Hall, the finale in the embassy), a hilarious set-piece (the fight in the taxidermy shop), a typically brilliant nervous performance by Stewart, and great locations throughout - the sweaty marketplaces of Marrakesh in the first half, and the quiet streets of south/east London for the second. If it has a fault, I think it's in the premise - child kidnapping stories never really appeal to me because they always result in a blindly moral hero and a happy ending. Thanks to Stewart's charisma, Dr McKenna is still a likable and interesting hero though, trying to figure out what's happened, what it means, and how best to extricate his family from the jam. Day is good casting I suppose as the wholesome wife, singing Que Sera Sera to her little boy, and she certainly fits the classic curvy blonde Hitchcock mold, but she's not nearly as much fun as Kim Novak or Janet Leigh. Also, the villains in this movie are a bit dull; Miles and DeBanzie are too sportingly British to hiss at, though the scary looking Nalder (the big bad vampire from the original Salem's Lot TV-movie) scores as Rien, the hit-man. As with many of Hitch's mid-period movies, Robert Burks' beautifully fluid camera-work and Bernard Herrmann's bombastic score sweep the whole thing along beautifully (Herrmann also appears as the conductor). A fine thriller then, with plenty to recommend it; just not one of Hitchcock's greatest. Originally filmed in black-and-white in 1934, with Leslie Banks and Peter Lorre - an almost unique incidence of a filmmaker directly remaking his own movie. Look fast for Hitch's cameo here as one of the crowd watching the acrobats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's remake of 1956: What Will Be Will Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE original film of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH was made in 1934, and was about a bunch of foreign agents (led by Peter Lorre) who kidnap a little girl to force her parents to keep their mouths shut about an assassination plot they are planning at London's Albert Hall. Hitchcock took this story to develop his memories of an incident in 1911, the Siege of Sidney Street, where a set of police killing anarchists (actually Russian revolutionaries) fought a pitch battle against army forces sent by Home Secretary Winston Churchill until artillery set their building on fire, and they were all killed. The original film was not a great one, but it was well directed and acted, and is still entertaining.But it bothered Hitch. He felt that the sequence leading to the assassination attempt at Albert Hall was not very well handled in the first film. Indeed, if you compare the two films the assassination is markedly different and more dramatic in the 1956 remake than in the original.In the original, the assassin is seen setting himself up in the Hall, to fire his gun at a given moment (when two cymbals crash). When Edna Best sees him about to fire she screams, but we do not see what happened. We see Lorre and his co-conspirators listening to the concert on the radio, and hearing the scream, a shot and consternation from the audience. Then the assassin returns, shame-faced. We are also allowed a sight of the dignitary being attended to while unconscious and wounded.The build up at the Albert Hall is more complex, with Hitchcock concentrating on the confusion of Doris Day (after the assassin reminds her of her child's fate), and the music (by Bernard Herrmann) building to the crescendo - we are even shown the turning of the page leading to the musical passage. The dignitary was a bearded old fogy in the first film. Here Hitch got a bald, plump man who looked very innocent to the viewer. And when the unstrung Day screams, it causes the assassin to misfire, and the dignitary to turn (he is shot in his arm as a result). The assassin tries to escape, but while tussling with a policeman in the opera box, he topples over to his death.It's one of many differences in the two films. There is no siege of Sidney Street now, but a final confrontation in the embassy of the country the dignitary rules (it is not a grubby bunch of conspirators, but people working for a conspiracy to kill their Premier). The ambassador is involved in the plot.The first murder is not at a party in Switzerland (as in the 1934 film) but at a street bazaar in Marraketch, with the person who tells Jimmy Stewart the assassination plot disguised as a native (why?).Hitchcock was working with big budgets in the middle and late 1950s he could only dream of in the 1930s. Instead of using many small models and sets, he could shoot on location - and colorful ones. He could also use superstars in his films (not just well known figures in British and Continental pictures like Leslie Banks and Pierre Fresney, and Lorre) like Stewart and Day. Interestingly enough the rest of the cast is not as sparkling (it is not like Grant - Saint - and Mason in NORTH BY NORTHWEST), but it is highly competent. Bernard Miles (later Lord Miles) was best recalled as Newman Noggs, the clerk who assists the hero in NICHOLAS NICKLEBY (1946). Here he plays an ultimately sinister part. Brenda De Banzie is best recalled as Charles Laughton's capable daughter who marries John Mills in HOBSON'S CHOICE. She is Miles' wife, and the troubled conscience in the kidnap plot.The films's suspense and color make it much more entertaining than the original, and it becomes the only Hitchcock film to produce a song hit: "Que Sera, Sera!" Doris Day made the most of that little tune, which becomes a key to the resolution of the film's plot.It is not the greatest Hitchcock film, but it is certainly one of the finest he created.</fullReview>

Who worries about entertaining guests and being polite when their child has been kidnapped? It really ruined the suspense.The scenes in Marakesh were great and Doris singing was nice but those are not what I watch a Hitchcock film for. I would get drawn into the suspense and then something so unrealistic would happen that it was almost frustrating to watch. I began to wonder how much they really wanted their child back and how much they just wanted to run around town.

		<fullReview>Whilst on holiday in Morocco the McKenna family meet the mysterious Louis Bernard. Later the next day the same man stumbles into the marketplace, stabbed and dying. With his last words Bernard whispers the details of a conspiracy to assassinate a statesman in London. To keep McKenna quiet the criminals kidnap his son. The McKenna's go to London to try and track down their son with the one clue they have ? Ambrose Chappell.If you are looking for someone to remake a Hitchcock film then probably Hitchcock himself is your best bet. Here he takes his black and white British film and updates it to the 50's. Much of the plot stays the same but it's a little padded out. This is particularly evident in the first half where it does go a bit too slow for my liking and feels like a travelogue film for some parts! The majority though moves along nicely and is more dramatic than the 1934 version. Where that was a little still and very British, this has a lot more emotion and is pretty tense at times.Stewart does very well in the lead and is convincing as the man becoming increasingly desperate as he hunts for his son. Day is OK but is a little annoying. I'm not a big fan of her so that may have something to do with it, but her singing was stretched and caused the film to drag and I only felt for her character in the Albert Hall scene where she showed her conflicting emotions very well. The villains are less than the original ? but who could compete with Peter Lorre?Overall this colourful version starts slowly and feels padded with African footage. However once the drama actually starts it works very well and is actually tighter and better than the 1934 film of the same name. Like I said, if you want someone to make a good remake of a Hitchcock film then surely the man himself must be your first stop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock, for me, was at the peak of his powers at Hollywood in the mid-to-late 50's, with a marvellous series of mostly colour films running from "Dial M For Murder" through to "Psycho". Whilst it's possible to recognise amongst the films he made those you could say he put special effort into, even amongst the, I hesitate to use the term, pot-boilers his style and mastery shine through. I'd probably put this movie, a big-budget remake of his British- made original back in 1934, in that category (along with "Dial M For Murder" and "To Catch A Thief") but watching it again, I was still greatly entertained by it.It helps to have star power to sell the film and whilst Stewart and Day don't at first seem the most natural married couple you'll ever see on screen, their chemistry picks up as their predicament progresses. Interestingly, Hitchcock doesn't present them as a pair of doe-eyed lovers. She's given up a successful singing career, wants another baby and needs sedatives to sleep, while he's gauche, hot-headed and over-trusting of strangers. Thus, while travelling through Marrakech, they improbably stumble into a plot to assassinate a foreign prime minister in London in the near future, at a gala concert in the latter's honour.Yes, the plotting is convoluted and of course the whole conspiracy could have quite easily been stopped at almost any time before the Albert Hall climax, but one must allow the Master his Magoffins. The screenplay even manages to introduce Day's later big hit song "Que Sera Sera" not only to give her a sing but, cleverly, as a valuable plot device.Stewart and Day, the latter dressed by Edith Head in classic mystery-blonde grey, are fine in the leads and of the supporting cast I particularly liked the weasel-faced actor who played the would-be assassin. Those archetypal Hitchcock touches I always look for naturally abound, never more so than for the superbly orchestrated (there is no more fitting word) extended sequence at the concert as the moment of truth draws ever closer. Good to see Hitch's composer-in-residence Bernard Herrman get a turn before the camera too. The film looks great in rich Vistavision colour, the interior sets are terrific and I also enjoyed the location shoots both in Marrakech and London. If not considered amongst the top rank of Hitchcock's films, I'd argue that's as much to do with the company it kept in the decade. For most other directors it would be a career highlight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of both Alfred Hitchcock and James Stewart and I really like their film collaborations like Rope, Rear Window, Vertigo and of course, The Man Who Knew Too Much. But in my opinion, this remake is probably one of Hitchcock's more underrated work. But I'm sure it was a hit when it first came out in 1956 and it even won an Oscar for Best Original Song. But I think this film deserves a higher rating on IMDb than 7.5. But I have to say, I never actually watched the original movie of 1934 and this is pretty much the only movie I've seen of Doris Day. But she and James Stewart did a great job as a married couple trying to save their boy and stop an assassination in London. And I've also heard that Doris Day mostly starred in romantic comedies and musicals and this one of her few serious roles but she really proved herself as a drama actress. And this remake has pretty much everything that makes a Hitchcock movie a classic: great acting, great mystery, great cinematography, great directing and great storyline.</fullReview>

Frenchman Louis Bernard befriends the family on the bus ride but Jo is suspicious of the inquisitive stranger. Ben dismisses her. They run into Bernard again. This time he's in the streets chased by the police, disguised as an Arab, stabbed in the back and tells Ben with his dying breath that a statesman is about to be assassinated in London and warns him about Ambrose Chappell. Hank is kidnapped by Edward and Lucy Drayton who pretended to be friendly fellow vacationers. Ben receives a threatening phone call. In London, Scotland Yard Inspector Buchanan (Ralph Truman) confirms that Bernard was actually an agent tracking an unknown couple who turned out to be the Draytons.Alfred Hitchcock simply makes an improved film over his first attempt. Stewart is the superior everyman lead actor. Doris Day is actually a good actress-turn-Midwestern-housewife. It's fascinating that he forced her to take a Valium before telling her that their son was kidnapped. It says a lot about their characters. The Morocco section is exotic. The second half is improved. Everything is better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typically professional Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Hitchcock movies go this isn't one of his best, although it seems to enjoy a high reputation (possibly because it was one of Hitchcock's five 'lost' films for nearly thirty years). A remake of Hitchcock's 30s version, it features Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day as a husband and wife travelling overseas with their young son who unwittingly become embroiled in an international assassination plot which results in the kidnapping of their son.The story is OK, with typical Hitchcockian twists and an air of mystery that Stewart perhaps seems a little to adept at working out. He and Day make an unlikely couple and Day, for the first part of the film, is annoyingly perky. Once the characters are established, however, and Hitchcock can devote more time to exploring the plot these quibbles become less significant and the minor characters come to the fore.Overall this is a professional enough Hitchcock, made when he was at the top of the craft. Ironically, it was for this reason that the great man preferred the earlier version - made by a talented amateur rather than a professional - and I think I tend to agree with him. It would be interesting to know, however, why, when the cast and crew travelled to Marrakesh for location shooting so many shots were filmed against an obviously fake backdrop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>music IS cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original. Only loose bits of footage i found on the extras of this DVD.I can only think of one reason why Hitchcock wanted to remake his own film, and that would be for the music. In the original, he didn't have Herrmann to count on. With Herrmann, he knew he could made truly powerful scene out of the Albert Hall bits. And the scene indeed is powerful, and fully anchored on the music. You have the tension of knowing what is about to happen, or supposed to. You follow 4 lines. Doris Day, trying to avoid a crime, the potential murderer and what he is doing, James Stewart trying to get there, figuring the whole thing and most importantly, the music itself, which is actually literally filmed at some moment (the cymbal's score, which the camera follows as the music develops). This fourth thread, of course, involves the other 3, marks the pace and itself becomes the narrative manipulator as everything happens to the sound of music. This is a very powerful concept which really is perfectly built here, and a coordinated effort of Hitch and Herrmann, one of their finest moments, and they had so many... Notice specially how the music conducts the actions of Stewart's character even when he is no yet at the Albert Hall. How the editing helps, as we follow Stewart through the corridors, outside the concert room, and as he talks to people and tries to find his way to the murderer, we feel about him what the music allows us to feel. The whole sequence is a perfect piece of film/music adequation, and thus, a perfect piece of collective film-making. Worth watching on that alone. This is, i suppose, where Coppolla picked his powerful finale for the Godfather trilogy, though he made it even more (literally) theatrical. Well he was working with an Italian opera, of an even more artificial nature than other Italian operas.Further more, we have another attempt at scene development through music. At the embassy, when Doris Day sings for her son to whistle, so his father can find him. We had this scene prepared from the very beginning, from the part of the film when suspense was only a promise. Probably, Day was chosen precisely because she was a singer, because she doesn't belong to the type of actresses and physical presences that Hitchcock was electing in those days for his films. The "Que ser ser" bit is not half as powerful as the Albert Hall sequence, and it looses even more because it happens right after it. "Logically", the Albert Hall could have ended the film, but i think Hitch was wanting us to live the aftermath of that sequence a little bit.Anyway, The rest of the film builds competently the mood for the Albert Hall, if you are willing to avoid asking yourself to many questions about what doesn't fit in the story. Except for the scene, this is just below average Hitchcock, to me. But watch it.My opinion: 3/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all about the mother</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As we learn early in the movie, Doris Day's character has left the stage for marriage and motherhood in a city far from the bright lights. Then her child is abducted and in order to find him she has to return first to the place where she was famous and the people who knew her, and finally to the songs she sang. It's strange, in a movie by Hitchcock, to find we are watching the story of a woman who sacrifices her identity to her husband's and then finds it again, but I find it hard to ignore the parallel between the child held hostage by killers and the singer's career held hostage by her husband. Heavy stuff for 1956.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me, this movie is about Doris Day, and the song "Que Sera Sera". I saw the movie decades ago, and remember identifying with little Henk, whose beautiful mother could sing lighthearted words that bore the secret meaning of life. I think it's hard for anyone born after 1970 to really understand what Doris Day represented to us all. Through her, we understood truth, goodness. What star can bring that magic to the screen today? Truth and goodness are in short supply, and we don't expect our actresses to transport us to another world.Having just seen the movie again 45 years later, I see now it was also a colourful and suspenseful Hitchcock spy movie set in Marrakesh and London. (Those details had faded from memory.) It's a pretty good film for the period; however, at one point (perhaps the fight in the taxidermist's shop) the film gets a little artificial and loses its way. Not one of Hitchcock's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first three-quarters of the film rank with Hitch's best. The McKenna family gets tangled up in international intrigue, while the suspense rarely lets up. The early scenes in Morocco are especially effective since we know something sinister is going on, but can't be sure what. The scheme unfolds slowly, so that we, like the McKenna's, are hanging on the next development, especially after Hank is kidnapped. Then there's that climactic scene in Royal Albert Hall, orchestrated to perfection by combining the action with the clashing cymbals. Also, Stewart and Day play their parts to perfection as agonized parents, which adds greatly to the overall gripping mood.To me, however, the screenplay errs fundamentally by adding an anti-climactic final sequence to end the picture. Yes, the locating Hank sequence is suspenseful, with Day singing her heart out. The trouble is that the Albert Hall showdown is so effective that the movie peaks in a way that leaves little tension for what happens afterward. It's a structural problem having to do with neither acting nor direction. Had the screenplay combined the two nail-biters into a single sequence, the problem would have been avoided, and, I believe, the movie improved.Anyway, Hitch's sure hand is evident throughout, making the feature a highly entertaining two-hours, with one of the great last lines of any movie. But, for Hitchcock fans, it's not front-rank flawless, I'm sorry to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another highly entertaining Hitch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man Who Knew Too Much is a remake of Hitchcock's very own version during his British period, with some considerable changes.This is certainly not disappointing and provides good entertainment throughout the 2 hours. James Stewart and Doris Day both offer strong performances as Mr and Mrs McKenna. The story is well executed, mystery slowly exposed and the atmosphere perfect to keep the audience on the edge of their seat. The scenes at the Albert Hall are certainly the most memorable to me. The Bernard Herrmann/Hitchcock brought great results again. Herrmann conducted the the orchestra and meanwhile the desperation of the leads were well exposed while the killer is about to pull the trigger. This takes a little less than 10 minutes of the screen time, with basically no dialogues; just the soundtrack and the visual execution of the plot, full of tension, thrill and suspense..classic Hitchcock moments,reminds me of a silent movie. I do think this would have made a perfect finale for the movie(given different time line is resolving the different angles of the plot) but there were still one thing to be resolve: the kidnapping. I think that the movie peaked during the scenes in the Albert Hall, specially in terms of tension and suspense and this maybe the reason why I felt the way this particular angle was resolved was a little anti-climatic.Overall, while not the best from the master,this movie is a highly enjoyable thriller with recognizable Hitchcock touch. Worth the watch, specially for a Hitch fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful and thrilling Hitch movie when a couple take a holidays in Africa and become involved in dangers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock's remake of his 1934 film concerns about the known story of McKenna marriage(James Stewart, Doris Day, in the first version Leslie Banks, Edna Best) along with their 11-years-old son travelling through Morocco during vacations. In a bus they know a sympathetic French person(Daniel Gelin, in the old version Pierre Fresnay). While they are in Marrakech they also know a couple(Bernard Miles and Brenda De Banzie) and happen suddenly on the scene of a killing, the dying whispers a political message.Then the child is abducted to ensure their silence and McKenna gets help to Morocco's Inspector Buchanan(Ralph Truman).This is a superb movie about a family who stumbles on to an obscure international conspiracy and then they're forced into action is excellently played by James Stewart and Doris Day. This exciting film displays suspense, intrigue, tension, and interesting drama well written by John Michael Hayes and Charles Bennett . Packs an ordinary theme of the suspense magician: innocent people become caught up in a cobweb intrigue and uncanny, intelligent villains. Colorful and glimmer cinematography shot in Morocco and London studios by cameraman Robert Burks, though with excessive transparency for Marrakech scenes. Lavish sets by Henry Bunstead, Hitchcock's usual, and working until his recent death. Of course,the highlights are the happenings of the famous Royal Albert Hall of London assassination where a sneering killer, Reggie Nalder, tries to execute while composer Bernard Herrmann is conducting orchestra. Besides at the climax Doris Day singing Que sera, Que sera, meantime her son suffering risks, the song won Oscar for Ray Evans, Jay Livingstone . The story was ferociously reviewed for its double characters but today is considered a classic movie and fairly entertaining. Rating : better than average, Hitchcock's enthusiastic no doubt will enjoy it.</fullReview>

Before he dies, he tells Frank of an imminent murder being planned, but before he can inform the authorities, a couple called the Draytons kidnap Hank and threaten to harm him if they tell. So the McKennas decide to investigate matters themselves, to save their son's life, and prevent the murder(if they can...) Surprisingly weak film has a good cast but an unbelievable and uninteresting story that goes on far too long, generating little excitement or suspense. A real misfire from Sir Alfred.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, I didn't liked the movie very much in the beginning. I'm a big Hitchcock fan but some of his movies are just merely average or even plain bad. This movie seemed to be one of those average ones, that wasn't really going anywhere with its story but things started to change suddenly for this movie, the moment it gets set at London. I can now actually honestly say that it's one of Hitchcock best and most memorable thrillers.This is such a strong but also quite entertaining thriller, from the master of suspense. It has a simple story and we never fully get to find out what the true intentions of the villains all are but it's all being used in such an incredibly good and powerful way. The story, despite being nothing special, works out just great. Especially when you start to compare this movie to other genre movies from the same period, there is no denying it that this one is one of the very best ones.It's a movie with some great thriller and mystery elements. Things start to get even more exciting once the movie heads toward its ending. It's when one of Hitchcock's most memorable sequences makes its grand entrance. Hitchcock movies often were filled with some classic memorable moments but never really with one that lasted over 12 minutes. It's a moment that captures about everything that often makes an Hitchcock movie so great to watch. It's an extremely well build up and executed tense moment. It's arguably also the moment that the movie should had ended. There is no way anything in this movie could had topped that and it also didn't happen.But the movie is not just heavy, tense stuff. There is plenty of room for entertainment as well, which makes this movie an even bigger joy to watch. It's simply a must-see Hitchcock directed movie, for which he again worked together with actor James Stewart, as his main lead.Hitchcock did not only handled the thriller elements extremely well, he also visually made the movie a beautiful one to watch. It had some great cinematography in it and it got shot at some nice locations, including the Royal Albert Hall. It's also fun to note that this is the movie the famous song 'Whatever Will Be, Will Be (Que Sera Sera)' got written for. It actually earned the movie its only Oscar as well.Despite the weak beginning, it still remains an absolutely great movie and a must-see classic Hitchcock thriller.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Man Who Knew Too Much" (1955) is Alfred Hitchcock's own remake of his 1934 thriller about a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) on vacation in Morocco where they got caught up in a nightmare that include murder, espionage, assassinations and the worst of all, kidnapping of their 10-years-old son. The movie which Hitchcock himself considered superior to the original is a great fun. Stewart and Day have a good chemistry together. The film is filled with the wonderful comical scenes and dialogues as well as the scenes of chilling suspense. The inclusion of "Que Sera, Sera" proved to be a stroke of genius because rarely the song fits the content and plays such an important role in the movie like "Que Sera, Sera" did in "The Man Who Knew Too Much". Hitchcock also treats us to the live music playing from Arthur Benjamin "Storm Cloud Cantata" for almost ten minutes while scene in London's Royal Albert Hall where the assassination of a very important politician was attempted takes place and both, the scene and the cantata are simply marvelous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful, with the perfect mix of comic relief, romance and even an Oscar-Winning song!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie, which was directed by Alfred Hitchcock, was brilliantly made. It starts with a family of three, a doctor (James Stewart), his wife (Doris Day)- who is a former stage singer, and their young son- my guess is about 10 years old, who are traveling through Morroco for leisure. On the bus, the bump into a French government agent, and they are a little too nice to him. He is killed at the marketplace after finding out the information he sought. He wants to carry this information out to someone, so he goes to the only person he, even slightly, knows: James Stewart. The antagonists kidnap their young boy and say if he tells anything about what the agent told him, his son would be killed. Stewart has to travel to London, because that is where his son is, and where the assasination that the agent told him about would be. The movie is very suspenseful. There are many twists and turns (typical Hitchcock movie). Also, it has just the right amount of comic relief. In addition to all of that, it won an Oscar for Doris Day's performance of "Que sara, sara." This movie is very good. It is hard to find a problem about it. I would certainly reccomend it to all Hitchcock fans and all suspense fans. I give this movie an "A-" only because it is a little bit predictable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This outstanding Hitchcock thriller is another highlight of a career packed with still rewarding gems. As I watched this, I realised I was viewing a master of his craft at the top of his game: THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH is perfectly balanced and up there with other timeless classics like DIAL M FOR MURDER and NORTH BY NORTHWEST.The film follows a traditional Hitchcock template but never feels dull. There's a twist on the classic 'wronged man' theme, as Jimmy Stewart finds himself unwittingly drawn into a conspiracy plot by literally being in the wrong place at the wrong time. There's globetrotting, some romance (Doris Day makes for a fine Hitchcock heroine and the film is worth a watch just for the scene in which she sings Que Sera, Sera) and humour to offset the thrills. Along the way, Hitchcock sets up two plot types that by now seem quite passe but which were groundbreaking in the day: he mixes the kidnapped child plot and the assassination thriller to great effect.It's hard to pick a favourite scene in a film filled with such gems, but I did find the movie gets better as it goes along (once the action shifts to London, we lose all the distracting back projection of the Moroccan scenery). The amusing scene in which Stewart tackles Richard Wordsworth (so recognisable as the doomed astronaut in Hammer's THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT) is a highlight, but nothing comes close to the unbearable suspense of the dialogue-free climax at the Royal Albert Hall, one of the master's best-ever moments, with Reggie Nalder (the blue-faced vampire in SALEM'S LOT) one of the most sinister villains I've ever watched. The perfect film package? I think so ? there are no flaws here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that this film is not considered to be one of Hitchcock's great works, but it will always hold a special place in my memory as it was the first of his movies that I ever saw.Since then I have seen some of his more acclaimed movies such as 'Psycho', 'Rear Window', 'North By Northwest' and 'Notorious'. Although I admired those films a great deal, for me this 50's remake of 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' still embodies the reasons why he is known as the 'Master of Suspense'. So many of his classic touches are there and although they were perhaps done better in other films, this was my first exposure to his genius.Perhaps this isn't VINTAGE Hitchcock, but it certainly is TYPICAL Hitchcock.Many other IMDB users seem to prefer the original 1934 version to this one. While I don't doubt that the older version is a fine movie, I doubt that I will enjoy it unless it's released on DVD. The video casseste picture and sound quality on other Hitchcock movies I've seen from that era have often degraded to such an extent that viewing the films often becomes a chore rather then a pleasure. Anyone else have that problem as well?</fullReview>

I had never gotten around to seeing this one yet despite it being VERY well known and so I sat down to enjoy what I fully expected to be yet another well made, exciting Hitchcock film.Well... I guess the story was all right and certainly the actors were all great and there were indeed a number of great sequences and editing throughout the film. BUT, and it's a BIG BUT like Mariah Carrey's, I absolutely could NOT believe that the pacing was SOOOOOO dang slow. Seriously... I totally SWEAR that there was a TON of filler and dragged out scenes in the film. ... for a 'Thriller'...???!! I mean, they spent friggin' FOREVER in the foreign country with minutes and minutes and minutes of long completely unnecessary footage of people and crowds and getting to here and there. Maybe I guess because the root story was actually very simple, I don't know. I'm sorry to say, but WHERE the hell was that ***TIGHT*** signature pacing and editing that we come to expect AUTOMATICALLY from any Hitchcock Thriller??? It just simply was not there... except of course here and there in certain sequences like the final editing as the musical performance was approaching it's end; now there was some nice camera work!It was just SO dang weird in a Hitchcock film to be sitting here with all these L - O - N - G, dead stretches and I'm completely non-plussed and amazed that I'm sitting here practically looking at my watch thinking 'Okay already, so wheres the 'Hitchcock' in this...???' Like I say, I'm probably just as amazed as you are (dear reader) that I am actually writing this, not only about an Alfred Hitchcock film, but a ***VERY*** famous Alfred Hitchcock film... It IS interesting though in the 'Making of' part of the DVD that one of the first things mentioned was that Hitchcock 'OWED' the studio a film and so he was looking for one of his older ones to redo; so IMMEDIATELY I think 'Aha! That explains it! His heart perhaps just wasn't really in it' So, maybe that's what it was; I don't know... Technically everything was just fine, but to me anyway, that special 'Magic' or Hitchcock 'Touch', OVERALL, just simply seemed to be missing...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's Forgettable Efforts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock's decision to remake one of his own films was certainly a strange one. Of course the story behind The Man Who Knew Too Much lends itself to countless interpretations and deliveries, with this version relying more on its star power and build-up than the original ever did. Sadly the film simply lacks the sense of suspense and gripping narrative we're so used to seeing Hitchcock provide. It never comes close to being a bad film (is that even possible for Hitchcock?) and is exceedingly well made, but for me it's just lacking too much to succeed.We follow Dr. Ben McKenna, his wife Jo and their son Hank on holiday in Marrakesh. There they meet a Frenchman named Louis Bernard who they befriend, but whose behaviour seems a little too mysterious. Their suspicions are proved right when Bernard is killed and in his final words he tells Ben spy information that has to be delivered to London. These scenes in Morocco are comfortably the film's best. I really like how exotic nature of the location is played, which includes a fantastic scene in a restaurant. They are also the most suspenseful moments. The wonder of who Bernard really is and the questioning of what his words mean. The McKenna's are just as much in the dark as the audience are, we discover as they do (a technique Hitchcock used so well in 'Rear Window').Things take a twist when Hank is kidnapped by a couple they also befriended called the Drayton's and Ben is warned that if he reveals any information then their son will be killed. I think this is handled well and the helplessness that the McKenna's are overwhelmed by is conveyed excellently. However, the film never really builds on what it has and becomes needlessly convoluted. They travel to London to use the information Ben has and search for the name Ambrose Chappell. This leads to a bizarre scene at a Taxidermist and the eventual realisation just feels too simple, to the point where you question how they didn't figure it out sooner. It's as if any suspense and tension the film had completely disappeared once they enter London because you never get a sense of fear or panic that is needed in order for us to feel like there's something at stake.As stated the film relies on the ability on James Stewart and Doris Day to really sell it, and I think both do good jobs. Stewart is as engaging as usual and Day really impresses in a rare dramatic role. Sadly I think the characters are a bit dull. They're just not well rounded, they seem nice but that's about it. We do get hints that their marriage is unbalanced and it should have been explored further, as it would have at least allowed us to sympathise with them more. By the time they figure out what's going on and the whole nonsense over Ambrose Chappell you start questioning how foolish they can really be. I also have to note how peculiar it is that a song as universally known as 'Que Sera, Sera' originally came from this film. It certainly isn't one that fits the tone or conjures up the imagery you might expect. The film builds to a grand third act at the Royal Albert Hall, where it turns out a minister is in danger of being assassinated. It's a suitably big climax, yet it never hits like it should because there is such disconnect to the characters. There is a lengthy sequence of the orchestra playing that is visually and technically impressive, but it leaves you asking what the point of it was once it is finished. As far as the technical aspects are concerned, the scenes in Marrakesh are certainly visually stimulating and I think the location is made both attractive and mysterious. Yet once the action moves to London it's on autopilot, almost as if Hitchcock didn't see the need for anything provoking or eye-catching to take place there. Stewart walking around the streets in broad daylight is neither fun to watch or suspenseful. It seems so weirdly flat.I read that one of the reasons Hitchcock did this film was to fulfil a contractual agreement. I can easily believe that to be the case. It feels as if so little energy has gone into it. As if they took the basic outline of the earlier version and just decided to make a couple of changes whilst updating it on the technical side. There's no denying that it's well made or that the actors give it their all and it does have its moments, notably in the earlier scenes. But there is such a lack of intrigue, tension and detail that are synonymous with Hitchcock's work. It ends up being a strangely by the numbers and forgettable effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful technique, silly plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This tale of a middle class American couple who turn sleuths on holiday to get back their kidnapped son is technically as good as anything Hitchcock ever made, but it gets ignored by the film critics because, frankly, the plot and the characters are too silly. The camera angles, the pacing of certain scenes, the choreography are all masterful and laden with portent and meaning - any budding film director could learn from this. For this reason, Hitchcock favoured this version over his 1935 original, but the original with its liberal use of humour (the chair fight in the chapel is a hoot) never takes itself that seriously and thus the viewer is forgiving of the sillier parts of the plot. Here, the viewer gets over long stretches with nothing more to go on than the creaky plot about a couple of squares, up against an unlikely bunch of crooks prepared attempting to assassinate the leader of a fictional country. A saving grace is where Hitchcock indulges in his lifelong dislike of the British police, by having two of the most pompous and ineffective police officers you could imagine utterly fail the US couple.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another delicious serving of suspense from the master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that this series of Hitchcock films I'm watching (most for the first time) has been an absolute treat. I'm quickly becoming familiar with his particular methods and idiosyncrasies, and he certainly does know his way around creating a suspenseful story. After THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY, he gets back to his typical fare with THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH (itself a remake of his 1934 film, which I've yet to see). Like the others in this vein that I've seen so far, Hitch creates suspense in a variety of ways and is able to sustain interest throughout, but seems unable to do a good ending. And in this film in particular, the pacing dragged on a little too much in comparison. Still, James Stewart and Doris Day both gave excellent performances, as well as having good chemistry. The real star, however, is a sustained sequence towards the end at the Royal Albert Hall, in which we finally see what the film has been building up to until that point. The gist of the story is that Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin McKenna are on vacation in Marrakech, but they stumble onto an assassination plot and their boy is kidnapped as a result. All of the Hitchcock trademarks are there. James Stewart and Doris Day play a likable American couple who are pulled into an extraordinary situation, and they have to be resourceful in order to reclaim what is theirs as the stakes are raised. There's also the usual methods of editing, camera-work, sound design, and score that create suspense as well as call audience attention to certain details that clue them on the importance of certain things. All of that worked really well, in my opinion. Still, as stated earlier, Hitchcock kind of fumbles the pacing and the ending. There were also some moments early on that had some early "green screen" work that was kind of jarring when compared to the on-location shooting with which it was intercut. While not necessarily a complaint, as technology has come rather since then, I did notice it. Still, for not quite living up to what I've seen of Hitchcock so far, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH is two hours of entertaining intrigue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another good Hitchcock - and in color</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always liked Hitchcock, I have always liked thrillers (without "divine" intervention) - it is therefore natural that I took my time to watch The Man Who Knew Too Much. It may well be so that I have seen this movie before decades ago, in my childhood on TV, but I remembered nothing...And I liked it from the start - the landscape (particularly Morocco), the actors, the old-school approach when facial expressions were important part of acting, and when movie makers had to be witty to create plausible scenes and activities, without the help of digital effects. All the main actors are both pleasant and gifted, and the beautiful song Que Sera, Sera fit smoothly into the main logic of events (sometimes the song is added to the credits only).So I liked the movie, and not having seen the original, I am unable to compare, but, whenever possible, I would prefer a color movie. Moreover, I got another kick to visit Morocco for the first time...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock Is Hysterical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film, although it is not my favorite Hitchcock. Still, he did a lot of great things in it. Doris Day was a different choice for the blonde romantic interest of the hero than Hitchcock usually cast, but she certainly showed she can handle drama as well as comedy. She projects a warmth and good humor before her son is taken, and after, she shows controlled anguish, just verging on panic enough for us to worry about her throughout. James Stewart is wonderful, as he always is in his Hitchcock roles.The film is notable for its scenes that are typical of Hitchcock's dark and dry humor. One is when Ben and Jo McKenna (James Stewart and Doris Day) are seated in a Moroccan restaurant, and Ben doesn't know what to do with his very long legs at that very low table.Another is when the McKennas get to London and Ben runs after a red herring, in this case, a father-and-son taxidermist duo both named Ambrose Chappel. The junior Chappel was played by Richard Wordsworth, who told me in the 1980s that he adored his silly scene, with him and Ben and two others scuffling in the shop and the senior Chappel dashing madly back and forth with the swordfish (quite a red herring, huh!), and the other taxidermist with the leopard, trying to avoid injury to the dead animals. Only Hitchcock could have come up with something so dry and witty.Of course Hitch used taxidermy as black humor again when he made Psycho.A final funny motif for this film was the use of the abandoned party guests in the McKennas' hotel suite. They aren't just superfluous either; they advance the plot by being helpfully bemused as husband and wife dash about London looking for their kidnapped son and missing each other in their journeys, but needing to be informed so that they can follow one another to each location. And there are the guests at the end, ready to be tied up as all plot strings should be, with the silly comment, "We had to go over and pick up our boy, Hank!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has aged very little because this time Alfred Hitchcock does not try to identify the enemy. It might be anyone from any country where the prime minister can be a fat white man who has good relations with Great Britain. Our Alfred meddles a little with Morocco and the French police in 1956. No surprise since Morocco was under the control of the French then. The main part concerns England three Americans lost in Britain, a surgeon, his singing wife and their charming Henry Hark of a son. The poor doctor who was taking a few days of vacation in the Maghreb with his family after a conference in Paris was amazed by the atmosphere and the strange people he met in Marrakech. But the plot thickens faster than it takes time for it to sickens and there we are with a child that was kidnapped under his own eyes, a man who was assassinated in the market place, some murmured secret whispered in his ear by the dying man who will reveal himself as being a French secret agent who does know how to fight back and only knows how to run when he is menaced by one knife. Ah! Those Frenchmen! Then London is not better. They run around from imbroglio to more imbroglio, from a taxidermist's to a chapel to an embassy to the Albert Hall to Scotland Yard to many other places. And all is well that ends well. And all ends well since all is well. But the humor of Alfred Hitchcock is so harsh at times, though here full of dainty nuances and nice tact. The cops are depicted as considerate and caring and yet distant when necessary. No brutality, no blackmailing, just the necessary coolness to make you understand that if you don't want to speak, then you are alone. And alone they are. The criminals who are mixing crime and politics since they are organizing a political assassination are priests in a local chapel in London, in Ambrose Street exactly. The wife is tender and supports the escape of the kidnapped son, which could mean their own death or arrest. This time he does not snigger at the cooking habits of the English, and their evolution, but at the eating habits of the Moroccans, with two fingers of their right hand ? right mind you ? and no use at all of their left hand. It is details like that, always reported and revealed with some empathy if not compassion, that make Hitchcock's style. And then you have his obsession of climbing and descending stairs. The stairs at the Albert Hall, and the stairs at the Embassy, and many other stairs here and there, plus of course the brand new way to exit a church, or a chapel as for that: use the bell rope to go to the top of the church tower and then use the rope you have shifted outside to go down to the ground. That's a fair use of a rope that is at least less sinister than its use in "Rope" or the use of the bell tower, bells and belle rope in "Vertigo". A little bit of a change. But climbing you have to when you are working for that Alfred. Climbing down too. And all that climbing connected with political terrorism before the term became popular. It was called a revolution in those days and it was trendy, in and fashionable to believe the world could not change in any other way. And Cuba was still to come, and after that one quite a lot in South America, in Africa and in Asia, and the war was just stopped for a couple of years in Vietnam and the war had already started in Algeria. When we think that Latin America has changed more in ten years with plain old elections than it had in fifty years before with violence, military like Pinochet or civilian like Nicaragua. Only one touch of hardly acceptable humor at the beginning. It was humor in 1956. But it is not any more. Yes it is something serious to pull the lace veil off the face of a woman in Morocco, even by accident. But that's really the only sign of aging, and a good sign about the world. The film is funny at times, dramatic at other times, always fast enough to be challenging and thrilling in a way though we don't know the embassy that is concerned by all that hullabaloo. And be careful not to be bitten by a lion's head on a wooden platter or sawed raw by a saw fish in the awkward hands of a seventy-one year old man.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID</fullReview>

When there is too much electricity in the clouds , storm is coming...And everyone is waiting for the clash of the cymbals , whatever will come after !!! Finding release , we may breathe normally after in the movie . But sometimes it is worth after and we will never breathe normally... It is the same music :"Storm cloud cantata" which is heard in the two versions:1934 and 1956. The same "finding release" when the clash of the cymbals came... But the situation before and after war are not the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If we have to choose a director that changed the cinema in a decisive way, for nearly forty years, that is without a shadow of a doubt Alfred Hitchcock. He directed more than fifty movies and is still today inspirational for directors and an enchantment for movie lovers all around the world. His movies are timeless and classics such as Vertigo or North by Northwest will always be remembered. Alfred Hitchcock is one of the few directors that never made a bad movie. Perhaps he is joined only by Coppolla or Scorsese here. The Man Who Knew Too Much is the only remake that Hitchcock directed. And it's a remake of a movie he directed in England in the thirties. And why did he did it? I think he knew that the screenplay was one of the best he ever had. And I suppose he thought that the movie with Leslie Banks and Peter Lorre was not perfect and could be improved. One of the improvements was James Stewart. He can play any part making us identify with him as the "common man". And Doris Day is here very well, with a face that passes to us all the drama of a mother fearing for her son's life. Since the beginning, the tension will rise slowly but inexorably, without being to intrusive or obvious, till it be suffocating in the Albert Hall scene, with the tremendous help of the music by Bernard Hermann.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sly comedy of Hitchcock.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe Hitchcock foremost tried to have fun with his movies, and he does here. While it is a story of political intrigue with very serious themes of kidnapping and assassination, the movie is filled with humor, including the very ending AFTER the climax. This same movie was made about 20 years earlier by Hitchcock, but with a different cast. He considered this remake the better version.James Stewart is Dr. Ben McKenna and, after a medical conference is traveling, sightseeing, with his wife Jo McKenna (Doris Day), formerly a well know stage star, and their young son Hank. In French North Africa, an incident on a bus gets them to meet Frenchman Louis Bernard (Daniel Gelin), who appears bent on helping them get to a good hotel and enjoy the city. They also meet a seemingly nice British couple Edward and Lucy Drayton. But, as is usually the case in a Hitchcock movie, all is not as it seems.Stewart was almost 50 here, and Day was just a shade over 30.SPOILERS are contained in the rest of my comments. Read further with caution. At exactly 30 minutes, there is a chase in the city, a man is stabbed, and it turns out to be Bernard, who dies in the Doctor's arms, but only after whispering that an assassination was being planned in London, and the words "Ambrose Chappell". Next, they find out their son has been kidnapped by the "nice" British couple, he will be safe if they don't repeat what the dying man said. Dr. Ben became the man who knew too much!! So, they travel to London, and in the phone book look up taxidermist Ambrose Chappell. Hitchcockian, this turns out to be a red herring. His wife intuits that the dying man really said Ambrose Chapel, a church, where the British couple were, and also holding their son. An incident there leads to the concert hall, where an assassination of an ambassador is being planned. It is foiled, the climax ends up at the embassy, where the son now was. The bad guys are overpowered, they get their son back, everyone is happy. The Doctor and his wife go back to their hotel room, where their friends were still waiting and simply say, "We're back, and we retrieved out son, Hank." A bit of comedy at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"AMERICAN'S DISLIKE HAVING THEIR CHILDREN KIDNAPPED"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So does everyone else. And this is what turns what would be a normally excellent suspense film into a masterpiece. In what, for years, had been considered my many of the childless elite intellectuals, as a poor casting choice by putting Doris Day in the role of Jo Conway, mother of the kidnapped boy, it is quite clear to me that Hitchcok made one of the greatest creative decisions of his career with her casting. Doris Day's melodrama, something which might possibly work against her in other films, was the glue that keeps us to our chairs as we watch the subtly growing complexities of a mother's heart ripped to shreds by the horror of her predicament.While these comments are just that, comments made by anyone, frequently annoymous (as I myself choose to be), they are spoken from a worldwide public soap box which reflects the sentiment and consciousness of our time. Because of this, I find it essential to observe, sorrowfully, that many people who have watched this film have seen it as 'boring.' More negative appraisals have concluded that there is a dated quality to the sentiment, that the triangle of desperation that exists in the McKenna family is overdone, too direct. These criticisms are true from the perspective of an age where emotion is evaluated, even our own emotions, with a third person perspective. Our lives, and therefore our films, must contain a self-conscious awareness that we are partaking in a fictional experience. It's the distance between our carefully maintained outward personas and our mundane human feelings that have created the revealing critical attacks on anything that's too vibrantly close to home.THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, with it's 'ugly american family' of the mid-fifties who are cultural unaware of others, truly describes a person and a family who, quite innocently, evoke the simple instincts of a desire to live, to enjoy life, and to not have their lives thrown into turmoil by the political activities beyond their control. These are not ugly Americans, they are not non-real people, they represent the sum of the apex of human feelings that occur, natrually and involuntarily, in our daily lives. In our current world situation, if these feelings were brought to the forefront in every culture's life, meaning those majority of the Islamic with children and a simple life and no fanatical axe to hack away with, the world might have a chance to avoid mass suicide by focusing on the simplicities of what's in our own backyard - to worry about how to get rid of our snails rather than winking at the cleverness of our personas. In other words, Hitchcock's film is one, without intending to, which speaks to the heart of this moment and, no doubt, coming as it did after the greatest war on our planet, the heart of the moment in the fifties when we still remembered, all too vividly that political forces beyond us maintain a grave threat to the normal and 'boring' joys of daily living.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining thriller but not one of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Stewart is THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, Dr. Benjamin McKenna. He, along with his famous wife Jo Conway (Doris Day) and son Hank (Christopher Olsen), is unwittingly embroiled in a dark, twisting conspiracy plot when he meets mysterious Frenchman Louis Bernard (Daniel Gelin) while on stopover in Marrakech. Why does Bernard tell him a secret of epic proportions just as Bernard is fatally stabbed in the back? And who exactly are the deceptively benign Draytons (played by Bernard Miles and Brenda de Banzie), and what is their agenda in all this? Left with the dying words of a man they only met the day before, Ben and Jo must find their son before both Hank and the target of the conspiracy plot are killed.This makes for a very entertaining film. More suspense than one would expect is injected into the proceedings, largely due, one feels, to the clever direction and the excellent scoring rather than the script or the characters. Not that everyone concerned doesn't try very hard. James Stewart never gives more than his best, which is quite a formidable best, and it isn't really his fault that Ben McKenna doesn't come off as a particularly three-dimensional character. In fact, Ben seems rather a chauvinist, despite the comfortable way in which Ben and Jo act around each other (which is more likely due to a rapport between Stewart and Day than between their characters). There's nothing about *Ben* that makes the audience empathise with him and want him to succeed, aside from the rather messy situation he seems to have found himself in. It's hard to feel pity or warmth for a character that isn't much more alive than Stewart can force it to be, and that's rather a shame. (Contrast this with Cary Grant's portrayal of Roger Thornhill in NORTH BY NORTHWEST--a similar idea of a man who knows nothing and is forced into a life of intrigue against his will. Grant's character is written with real depth, and Grant plays him marvellously. Stewart doesn't have the same luxury of a well-written character to work from; most of the time one doesn't sense desperation in Ben, but doggedness... it's hard to sympathise with a character whose love for his son--or wife, for that matter--never comes through very well.) The same goes for Doris Day's Jo Conway-McKenna. You can tell that she's trying her level best at what is, for her, a rare dramatic role. She almost pulls it off at times, particularly in the scene where Ben gives Jo sedatives before breaking the news to her about their son's kidnapping. Day really evokes Jo's anger at Ben giving her drugs to calm her down, mixed with the desperation she feels at her son's disappearance. As with her husband Ben, one doesn't feel sympathy towards her per se, but more towards her situation. It's quite a shame to think one could have really been done with this film if the two main characters had had a genuine spark of life in them, something more than the instant affability Stewart lends all his characters, or the singing voice Day gives hers. It probably goes without saying that the only person who could remake a Hitchcock film without getting a lot of flak is Hitchcock himself. I've not seen the 1934 black-and-white original, but Hitchcock does manage to create the suspense one expects to find in his films with a minimum of fuss. It's not quite on the level of the heart-racing NORTH BY NORTHWEST, nor does it have the sexy undercurrents pulsing through NOTORIOUS, but THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH does have its thrilling moments and keeps up a brisk pace through its 2-hour running time. There are some implausibilities required to bring the film to a close (Jo singing 'Que Sera Sera' loud enough for it to reverberate through an entire *mansion*, for one), and a few oddly-directed scenes, but on the whole Hitch does his best by this film. What also works in its favour is the authenticity that went into the scenes set in Marrakech. Whether or not it was filmed on location, it at least feels and appears more or less right. All in all, a good film and an entertaining one, but it's not as edgy and suspense-filled as NOTORIOUS, or as amusing and funny as NORTH BY NORTHWEST. The comparisons are only made to indicate what THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH is--a competent exercise in film-making by all concerned, but not the best work turned in by any of them. You probably won't be bored watching this film, but it's highly likely you won't have fallen in love with it by the time you've seen it either. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Taut, Well-Woven Tale of Suspense in True Hitchcock Form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Hitchcock, especially his films of the fifties and early sixties. "Rear Window" is amazing, "North By Northwest" is thrilling. "The Birds" is terrifying. And "Psycho," well, that may be the pinnacle of Hitch's film career. Definitely to add to that list now is "The Man Who Knew Too Much," a quintessential film by this brilliant director.James Stewart and Doris Day play Dr. Ben and Jo McKenna, respectively, vacationing in Morocco with their young son, Hank, played by Christopher Olson. On the bus, they meet a Frenchman whom they soon befriend, but grows to become quite a suspicious character. The second day of their trip, he is murdered, and utters his dying words to Ben. Words that may be the reason he was killed. For it is a plot to assassinate an Ambassador in London. When Ben and Jo go to the police to make a statement, Hank is kidnapped, as to keep the couple quiet about what they know. Now they must race to figure out how to stop the assasination, and save their son, before it all becomes too late. Needless to say, this is one hell of a movie, with unbearable tension, amazing action, and an edge-of-your-seat climax at Albert Hall, famed for having no dialogue at all for twelve straight minutes. Definitely Hitchcock.First, the acting. Jimmy Stewart--amazing as always. He is one of Hitch's finest "every man" characters, truly identifiable and sympathetic, not to mention pretty witty at times. As for Doris Day, well...why do so many people put her down? She gives, without a doubt, one of the most amazing perfomances as a Hitchcock blonde EVER. Rare do we find the heroine to be a happily married wife and mother. It's usually an Eva-Marie Saint-like character, ala "North By Northwest." Icy, yet suave and sexy. Jo McKenna is quite a refreshing character, and I really liked her. Doris Day pulls off the role with an impeccably emotional yet strong performance. (Interesting backstory: Day was incredibly uneasy with Hitch for much of the shoot, since he said nothing of her performance, making her think he didn't like her. Finally, she offered to have herself replaced, and Hitch was shocked, claiming the only reason he remained silent was because he was so happy with how she played the role.) I loved her character from beginning to end.The movie is filled with humor (towards the beginning, ie: the hilarious dinner scene), excitement, suspense, and a rare treat, emotions. My favorite scene (without giving too much away) is when Ben reveals to Jo that Hank isn't with the friends they met on the trip, but kidnapped, and she absolutely loses it. I mean, wow! That's a scene to watch twice, it's so powerful. Another great part is the church scene, especially the brilliant alms-giving scene, and...well, I'd hate to kill it, but the look Jo and Ben give to Mrs. Drayton is absolutely priceless. And of course, the Albert Hall scene. It builds tension amazingly well, the music being working perfectly to makes our hearts pound, especially because we know when the shot is to be fired and the Ambassador killed. One question, though: Why does Jo only stand there and cry, if she knows what's going to happen? Or does she? That may be my only problem with the film, and maybe that the two climaxes (the Albert Hall scene and the preceding scenes at the recital) could have been put into one, perhaps all taking place at the former. But with a film this amazing, anyone could look past that.Perhaps one of the best scenes, though, is the ending. That may be, hands down, the funniest Hitch ending I have ever seen, and intentionally. It works perfectly, and had me laughing long after the movie was over. It's worth everything, just to see that.Do I even need to recommend this? I mean, this is one of Hitch's best. I'd suggest buying it; I could stand to watch it again. Definitely a recommendation to newcomers to Hitchcock films. It's one of his ideal films. I haven't seen the original yet, but with a rare remake like this--rare in that it is so amazing, unlike most remakes (1998's "Psycho," anyone?)--you almost don't need to see the first. This one is great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man Who Knew Too Much has many twists and turns and gave me chills a number of times. It also made me laugh and feel completely baffled and intrigued (but it all makes sense in the end). There is so much suspense and the plot just keeps moving. As some questions are answered, others are raised. It's masterful in the way it creates suspicion and then gradually reveals information. The nature of the situation keeps changing. At first we're wondering what on Earth is going on and then as we find out, our confusion turns into apprehension about what we sense is likely to happen. Hitchcock heightens the tension as much as possible. He seems to casually break the rules of what you're meant to show at what time during a movie.There is a strong sense of the family bond and its importance in this movie. Doris Day is emotional for a lot of the movie but it's easy to relate to and is quite heart-breaking. The story has a number of moving moments but they aren't dwelt upon. The focus is on the plot which is highly interesting and engaging.This movie has the confidence to calmly let things unfold by themselves. We can wonder what we want about various characters and events. All is eventually revealed. We aren't told what to think or believe or feel. The music simply builds on our own bewilderment at the things that are happening. There are red herrings, MacGuffins, dead-ends. A magician that uses mis-direction is much more effective than one who gives away every trick because their performance is one-dimensional and their method is transparent. I feel most film- makers fit into this second category whereas Hitchcock takes us on a ride which he has control over.It was awesome seeing Bernard Herrmann himself conducting an orchestra during the climax of the film. There are many memorable, dream-like images throughout the movie but especially in this sequence. The music is exciting and mysterious. There is a huge amount of build-up to one moment in particular.This might not be as dark as Vertigo or Psycho but it's still pretty intense. Hitchcock's films make most movies seem like jelly, some kind of soft, useless stuff that doesn't do anything. His movies take simple ideas and draw them out into unforgettable experiences. They have no flab, they cut straight through to the point. And the point isn't what happens next in the plot, it's what the audience is thinking and feeling at this point and how can he play with that in the most tantalising, entertaining way. Whatever, this movie is awesome and Hitchcock is one of the best directors of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My '95 trip to Marrakesh turned sour when I stupidly sampled a dodgy sausage from a food stall in the Jemaa el-Fnaa (I'll spare you the gruesome details?it wasn't pretty!); but as nasty as my experience was, it pales in comparison to the anguish suffered by Benjamin McKenna and his wife Jo (James Stewart and Doris Day) after an encounter with Frenchman Louis Bernard (Daniel Glin) turns their lives upside-down. Jo is instantly wary of Bernard's over-inquisitive nature and suspects that he is hiding something from them, but Ben is dismissive of his wife's intuition; he is proved wrong, however, when the pair become embroiled in an international assassination plot that involves the kidnapping of their son Hank.The Man Who Knew Too Much? Hitchcock's remake of his own 1934 movie of the same name?isn't all that strong in terms of plot but still succeeds in being an entertaining piece of escapism nonetheless thanks to the director's confident handling of his material (he nails it second time around) and fine performances from Stewart and Day. Hitch's affable leading man puts in another solid performance, but it is Day who really surprises here: the usually fluffy actress is extremely likable, of course, AND gives her vocal chords a workout (belting out the unforgettable 'Que Sera, Sera' not once, but twice), but the lovely lady also impresses with her range as an actress, proving herself more than capable in emotionally charged scenes. Cadaverous actor Reggie Nalder also makes a lasting impression as the creepy killer hired to shoot the president of an un-named country during a concert at The Albert Hall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You buys your ducats for a thriller . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . and a gosh Dern concert breaks out! Director Alfred Hitchcock, a.k.a. "The Master of Suspense," liked to keep his audiences guessing. One famous example comes at the end of PSYCHO, which in many people's minds might consist of a certain character's car sinking into a swamp (more attentive folks might guess it involves this car being winched out). But if you watch the actual film again, you will find that PSYCHO actually closes with a seemingly endless string of psychobabble Hitch left in as a joke on the audience to placate the whims of his screenwriter, who was undergoing therapy at the time. This string of gibberish is not much more intelligible than "Lucky's Speech" in WAITING FOR GODOT. Similarly, as film buffs seeing this remake of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH for the first time are on the edge of their seats, wondering what will happen to the kidnapped little boy and whether Queen Elizabeth II is the assassination plot target, Hitch humors his composer--Bernard Herrmann--by letting him direct (on camera!) a group of well-fed females as they bleat in an opera hall about "The trees, the trees, the trees"! For Cripes sake, how do you expect us to see the cathartic for us for "the trees"?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Amongst Hitchcock's Finest But A Fine Thriller Nonetheless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of Alfred Hitchcock's 1934 film of the same name, The Man Who Knew Too Much tells the story of a family which, while vacationing in Morocco, gets unexpectedly entangled in an assassination plot and is pursued by the conspirators who are hellbent on preventing them from causing any sort of interference with their plans.Having watched a number of Hitchcock's films in the past few days, I was expecting another mood-escalating thriller from the genius filmmaker who never fails to amaze but this time the experience wasn't as satisfying as it has been on most occasions previously. The film no doubt delivers on most goods but unfortunately feels slightly overlong &amp; extended in the end.Featuring a clever plot, impressive direction, rich cinematography, mesmerising music and striking performances from James Stewart &amp; Doris Day, The Man Who Knew Too Much has its moments, including one where it could've culminated magnificently well before the actual conclusion. And even though it may not rank amongst Hitchcock's finest works in my book, I'd still recommend it for this thriller is definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What You Would Expect from a Hitchcock Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not had a huge exposure to the films of Alfred Hitchcock but those that I have seen have been quite enthralling. This film is no exception, and while I would not call it a wild ride as some would term films, it does keep you engrossed to the end.This film is about a young family, the McKenna's, who travel to Morocco for a holiday so that Dr McKenna (James Stewart) can visit that land in peace that he had fought in in war. However, on a bus trip to Marakesh, his son accidentally trips and pulls the veil off of a Muslim woman causing an uproar. Fortunately a Frenchman steps in and calms the situation down, however while gaining a new friend, they suddenly find themselves caught up in an international plot to assassinate the prime minister of a small, African country.This is not a spy movie, but rather a movie about how ordinary people can find themselves caught up in extra-ordinary situations, and how the love of a young child drives the parents to save the child, while in doing so uncovering a sinister plot and saving the life of a very important man. However, the main characters are not ordinary people in the sense the we understand ordinary. While they are a simple family who does not look for trouble (though one can argue that simply by traveling to Marakesh is asking for trouble) they are not ordinary people. Dr McKenna is, as can be seen from his name, a successful and wealthy surgeon, and his wife was a former, well known, singer songwriter. However they do not want fame in the sense that we know fame. They have had their time in the sun and now simply want the quiet life.However the quiet life does not find them. They cannot sneak into London as in doing so brings a crowd of adoring fans to the plane, and they have great difficulty getting out alone in London as their friends descend upon their flat for drinks and a catch up. Even further, when they do save the Prime Minister's life, they once again become heroes. However all they want is to get their son back safe and sound. It is not the Prime Minister we care about, but the innocent boy who has been kidnapped and made a pawn in a plot that they never intended on getting involved in.As a final note with Hitchcock: as we all know his trade mark is that he appears as a cameo in all of his movies. Sometimes he is easy to spot, other times it is almost impossible. This movie falls into the second category.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of those remakes that is just as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Man Who Knew Too Much from 1934 was a very good film, though not classic Hitchcock, gritty and suspenseful with a creepy Peter Lorre. On first viewing this remake was good, on re-watch it is now very good and just as much as the original. The beginning is a little too padded out and the kid is annoying. However the production values are more polished than those of the original, which took a much grittier approach, and look beautiful in every aspect. Hitchcock directs splendidly, the Albert Hall sequence is Hitchcock all over and is one of his best-ever climaxes/scenes. Bernard Hermann's score, what there is of it, is audacious and suspenseful, and while Que Sera Sera seems to be an excuse for Doris Day to sing and its placement in the film is somewhat forced it is a good song(much better than remembered) and Day sings it beautifully. The dialogue is appropriately tense and witty, and the story though with some padded-out moments is more developed and more freely structured than the original, the taxidermist scene is a good scene but the highlight is by far the Albert Hall climax. James Stewart is superb as he was in all of his Hitchcock outings(Vertigo is the best of his Hitchcock films and performances though) and Doris Day is affecting in a rare dramatic role. The chemistry between them is believable, perhaps more so than that of the leads in the original. Bernard Miles and Brenda De Banzie are on admirable villain duty and Reggie Nalder is appropriately menacing, though neither are quite in the same league as Peter Lorre in the original. All in all, very good Hitchcock film and one of those remakes that is just as good as the original. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A kidnapping that leads from Marrakesh to London</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After attending a conference in Paris Dr. Benjamin McKenna, along with his wife Jo and son Hank take a trip to Morocco. While on the bus to Marrakesh they meet a Frenchman by the name of Louis Bernard who invites them to join him for dinner that night. Shortly before the meal Louis cancels saying something came up that he must deal with? then as they are eating their meal with an English couple, the Draytons, they met in the restaurant they see Louis turn up with somebody else! The Draytons invite the McKennas to go to the market with them the next day; while they are there they have quite a surprise when they witness Louis Bernard being murdered? with his dying breath he tells Dr. McKenna that a statesman is to be murdered in London in a few days time and that Ambrose Chapel is involved. Following the murder they are taken in by the police for questioning while Mrs Drayton looks after Hank. Before he can tell the police anything he gets a phone call? if he wants to see Hank again he must not repeat what he was told! The action then moves to London where the McKennas must find Ambrose Chapel and foil an assassination before they are reunited with their son.This isn't one of Alfred Hitchcock's best known films but it is still well worth watching as it is a solid thriller with plenty of excitement as well as a surprising number of comic moments? watching James Stewart trying to sit down in the Arab restaurant and the fight in the taxidermist's shop was hilarious. There were some good twists; who'd have thought the charming Draytons would turn out to be kidnappers involved in a murder plot?! The action scenes were well handled; in fact the only scenes that didn't look good were the opening ones on the bus where the back projection looked too obvious. Stewart put in a good performance as Dr. McKenna and was ably supported by the beautiful Doris Day who played his wife Jo. If you've enjoyed Hitchcock's better known films and would like to try some of his less famous films this isn't a bad place to start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really entertaining movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. It had loads of suspense and was very well directed. I found one scene in particular to be very well done. Hitch shoots the climax of the film as a symphony plays with no dialogue from the characters. It feels like you're are watching a silent film in color, and it is masterfully done. It is extremely suspenseful, and you don't miss hearing people talking. It was cool to see the veteran director return to his silent film roots thirty years later.The only negative that I had with this movie was that Dorris Day never quite seemed real to me in this film. I felt like I was watching an actress play a character rather than seeing the character. Hitchcock would have been better off with his first choice for the role, Grace Kelly.That doesn't ruin the movie, though. Jimmmy Stewart was great as always, and Hitchock delivers a fast-paced, suspenseful, and at times comedic adventure. It isn't as great as Rear Window or Vertigo, but it is a very good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed in 1956 by the master Alfred Hitchcock, 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' is a remake of the 1934 movie with the same name and directed by the same man. However, this version proves to be much superior than it's predecessor. Hitchcock directs and gives a lesson on producing an excellent 'suspense' film.Of course, the movie has it's ups and flaws. I think the only flaws I can find is that the movie takes a bit long to really start engaging the spectator. But, when it engages, it really engages and that's a good point. The other thing I can point, is the fact that this movie was somehow forgotten...being only nominated for one academy award, I suppose the Academy could nominee Hitchcock for best director, as the scene in the Royal Albert Hall is memorable, in the way he coordinates the soundtrack with the tape to increase the movie's tension.Either way, the plot was pretty good. Not an amazing one, but simple and sharp. That twist that it does, when the McKenna's think they can trust the Drayton's and not Louis Bernard, and in the end, this last one is the one they were wrong about and the Drayton's are bad, was quite interesting.James Stewart, was again fantastic, as well as the lovely Doris Day for her acting and also, singing talents.This is not Hitchcock's best, but surely for me, one of his best. The message that it transmits that 'Que ser, ser' whenever you trust the wrong people, is pretty compelling and deserves some attention. If you're a Hitchcock fan, then this is recommended to you and don't miss it - 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of Hitchcock's most popular thrillers still gives goosebumps today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the only specific time that Alfred Hitchcock remade one of his own films (at least that I can think of, there may have been unofficial "renderings" of his works again and again, as an auteur may do), The Man Who Knew Too Much made use of Bernard Herrmann to such an explicit degree that he appeared himself conducting an orchestra in a quintessential scene. He also brought on Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day to make it a commercial viable picture (unlike the 1934 film, which only has Peter Lorre to remember it today for the cast). And by the mid 1950s, anyway, he was so far along as a technical marvel with suspense, timing, building dread and moments of psychological tension with just the simplest and tactful glance or direct dolly of the camera or twist of the lens that he could far surpass his creative flaws of the early 30's. It's a fool-proof thriller, if you will, one that can draw in audiences all over for its plot that involves a kidnapping, but with no ransom, and a murder plot that runs like a clockwork mousetrap game.The plot is as is: Stewart and Day are a married couple with a boy in Marakesh on vacation, and after they witness the murder of a man they just met the day before on a bus- and who whispers some dying, crucial words to the doctor Stewart- their child is kidnapped and taken to London. No cops allowed, no funny business, just strict instructions, more or less based upon some of the other dying words from the man killed in Marakesh. After Hitchcock sets up some visually compelling and striking scenes in Morocco, ones that also have early on the typical-but-yet-not scenes of the doctor and his wife in the mundane joy of a vacation spoiled at first by an uneasy feeling of being watched or followed, he plunges into the terror of the situation. There's even a moment for an extra human dimension, where Stewart gives Day the pills to keep her calm before telling her the news of the kidnapping. This won't be some run of the mill case to be dealt with; it's a case of leverage more-so than profit in taking the kid, for the 'plot' to go off without a hitch.Then in England, Hitchcock delivers some interesting scenes involving a man (or rather, a place) Ambrose Chappel, including a classic bit inside the chapel itself. But while already scenes have been extremely well acted by the two stars, and all the supporting players (especially the creepy looking fellow who's to do the big murder) are top-notch, nothing can top what Hitchcock has been building towards- and more than hinted at with the very opening of the movie, as though giving hints to a riddle that the Master loves to unravel like a careful kitten- which is the Royal Albert Hall sequence. Herrmann, conducting himself, sets the exact tempo for the suspense of the sequence while also acting as a procession of the plot, and every little piece falls in with the delicious glee that the director has in his finest moments. If for no other reason to see the Man Who Knew Too Much, and there should be many, this sequence is an essential movie-viewing experience. Not even the Que Sera Sera finale, which is also excellent, can't top it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the middle of the film, Reggie Nalder's character Rien says to Bernard Miles (Drayton) "A Wolf in Sheep's clothing. A very clever disguise." That's how we see the villains in this film. Ambassador is a very close friend of the Prime Minister. When Doris Day (Mrs. McKenna) calls Prime Minister near to the end of the film, Prime Minister says "Any friends of mine are friends of his (Ambassador)." But he doesn't know that Ambassador is his enemy. This is another example of A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing. We see Drayton and his wife as a very nice couple at Marrakesh. But later the main characters and the audience finds out who they really are.Its really a great film. But when I watched this film first time. I didn't like it. After repeated viewings, I like this film a lot. Royal Albert Sequence is absolutely brilliant. Alfred Hitchcock once said that he liked to play the audience like a piano. We see that in many of sequences in this film. Royal Albert Sequence is a major example. Other examples are the scenes where James Stewart (Dr. McKenna) "walks" to find Ambrose Chappell taxidermist. Dr. McKenna and the audience feel that someone is following. The Place is absolutely quiet. After few seconds, we see a man walking behind. Later, Dr. McKenna and the audience finds out that it was all a wild goose chase. But Hitchcock was able to give the audience "horror" where there is no "horror." Young Ambrose Chappell at Taxidermy shop first looks like he may have some connections to Draytons. Later, we realize that he isn't a wolf. But just an innocent sheep.This was Hitchcock's last film where John Michael Hayes as a screenwriter. John Michael Hayes wrote the screenplay based on a brilliant "Treatment" written by Angus MacPhail. Alfred Hitchcock and Herbert Coleman wanted to give screenplay credit to both Angus MacPhail and John Michael Hayes. But John Michael Hayes took complete credit for the screenplay against wishes of Alfred Hitchcock and Associate Producer Herbert Coleman. This led to the end of the relationship between Alfred Hitchcock and John Michael Hayes.One of the problems Hitchcock faced was he had to start shooting before the script was finished. But Hitchcock was able to explain some of the elements that was missing. For Example, how did Inspector Buchanan know that Hank (the son of Ben and Jo McKenna) was kidnapped? We realize in the end that footman who works at Embassy of the Ambassador (the main villain) secretly works for Inspector Buchanan. This explains how Inspector Buchanan received many of the information. Guy Verney played the footman. I like both versions (1934 and 1956) of The Man Who Knew too Much. But I like Original one a little more better, because of Peter Lorre, Chair Fight, and Hitchcock's direction. I thought the villains were much more stronger in the original. But this is just my opinion.I highly recommend this film. I have a request. Please watch it again if you didn't like it that much. Afterall, this is a film from Hitchcock. And I liked the film a lot more after repeated viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film to See Over &amp; Over Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years I have enjoyed viewing this great Alfred Hitchcock picture which has a great story about Dr. Ben McKenna, (James Stewart) and his wife Jo McKenna, (Doris Day) who decided to visit Morocco for a brief vacation of three days and it becomes a complete nightmare. Dr. Ben is standing in a street in Morocco and meets up a man with a knife in his back and tells him some very important information about an assassination plot, but the man dies before he can tell the complete information to help. However, there are people involved with this crime who manage to capture their little son named Hank McKenna, (Christopoher Olsen) who is a very bright little boy who loves his mother very much and he loves the song she always sings to him, "Whatever Will Be, Will Be". There is a visit to Albert Hall in London where the London Symphony Orchestra is playing and for some reason the cymbal player becomes a very important person in this crime story. I have enjoyed viewing this picture many times over the years and it is truly a great film with Doris Day and James Stewart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's "entertainments," and a pleasant two hours it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956; I've never seen the 1934 version) the same way I like To Catch a Thief. Both are big, fat, satisfying entertainments made by professionals at the top of their game but perhaps without much to chew on afterwards. This isn't much of a criticism; I just don't put the film in the same category of some of Hitchcock's other, greater films. One weakness (which also is a strength) is Doris Day. When she's sobbing and being hysterical she gets on my nerves. It's too much and too "actorly." Her strength in the movie is that for most of the time she's good company, and she's believable as a woman who will do what it takes to rescue her son. She paired well with Stewart in both star power and likable personality. I do think the movie is too long, the curse of so many movies beginning in the Fifties. For me, this undermined some of the set pieces; I wanted Hitchcock to get a move on. The scenes I particularly liked were the unease and suspicion that developed in the church, the cocktail party chit chat, the build-up in the Albert Hall and the rescue of Hank. And let's hear it for some fine actors who made appearances. I have a lot of admiration for Brenda de Banzie who played the wife of Bernard Miles. She was a fine actress; just see her in The Entertainer as Olivier's wife or in Hobson's Choice when she makes a man of John Mills and masters Charles Laughton (who detested her). Bernard Miles was a first class actor who could play just about anything but aristocrats. For those who like medals and honors, Miles was made a Sir in 1969 and became a lord in 1979 (the first actor to do so after Olivier). Not bad for the son of a farm laborer and a cook. The cocktail party had some old friends it was good to see. Among the familiar faces were Alan Mobray, Hillary Brooke and Carolyn Jones. And among the best of the best is Reggie Nalder, who played the assassin. According to IMDb, he was a handsome guy who, when a young man, was burned severely over the bottom third of his face. He was a chilling killer in The Man Who Knew Too Much who made the premise of the film -- a political assassination -- believable and dreadful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Don't you realize that Americans dislike having their children stolen?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remaking an Alfred Hitchcock film is almost always considered blasphemy in the world of cinema, except, of course, if your name happens to be Alfred Hitchcock. 'The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934)' was one of the director's first major successes, and is among the strongest of his pre-1940 British output, a tense and atmospheric thriller with a truly sinister villain in Peter Lorre {in his first English-speaking role after fleeing Nazi Germany}. In 1956, at the peak of his fame, the Master of Suspense decided that the story was ripe for a remake, and that he might as well be the one to do it! James Stewart and Doris Day play a respectable American couple whose family holiday to Morocco ends in disaster, when their young son, Hank, is kidnapped to prevent the exposure of a London assassination attempt. Though the story is exceedingly simple, and the film itself never really amounts to anything more than two hours of impeccable entertainment, 'The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956)' is quite noticeably a Hitchcock film, and the director's ability to thrill and amuse us has rarely been stronger.It is a genuinely fascinating exercise to compare Hitchcock's two versions of the same story, as it gives us the opportunity to pinpoint exactly how the director's craft evolved following his migration to Hollywood. In a 1967 interview with filmmaker and critic Franois Truffaut, Hitchcock referred to the 1934 version as the work of a "talented amateur," and the remake as the work of a "professional." This is certainly an accurate description of both, though I'm going to have to go against the grain and suggest that the original version is the ever-so-slightly superior film, if only for having a strong villain in Peter Lorre {compared to the remake, which has nobody quite so memorable}. The acting performances in the remake are solid and effective, especially the two leading stars. Doris Day, in a welcoming break from the stereotypical helpless wife, plays a graceful yet independent motherly figure, so determined to rescue her son from the kidnappers that poor Jimmy Stewart can hardly keep up. Despite her husband's apparently-low opinion of her capabilities {he insists that she take sleeping pills before he informs her of Hank's disappearance}, Jo McKenna proves equally instrumental in facilitating the film's happy ending.The undisputed centrepiece of 'The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956)' is, of course, the incredible Royal Albert Hall sequence, a breathtaking dialogue-free 12 minutes that stands as one of Hitchcock's all-time most impressive set-pieces. With composer Bernard Herrmann conducting the London Symphony Orchestra, the Master of Suspense uses music and visuals to create the necessary suspense. The musical piece, the "Storm Clouds" cantata, was originally written by Arthur Benjamin for the 1934 film. Slowly but surely, the orchestral piece increases in tempo, drawing ever-so-slightly closer to that critical moment when the musician claps together the two giant cymbals {a scene that was already shown to us during the opening credits}. Despite the climax of the film failing to live up to the tension of the Albert Hall sequence, the remainder of the film is certainly intelligent, creative, suspenseful and hilarious, and no Hitchcock fan should be disappointed. If you're yet to check out the 1934 version of the film, then I also wholeheartedly recommend that one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another well directed, scripted, acted and photographed movie from Alfred Hitchcock. "The Man Who Knew Too Much" involves a doctor who, holidaying in French Morrocco with his wife and young son, inadvertently becomes embroiled in espionage as a dying man tells him of an assassination plot.The story is unlikely, however it's quite cleverly done, as is the working into the plot of Doris Day's "Que Sera Sera", albeit a tad corny. James Stewart is solid and Miss Day quite outstanding in a film which again carries the master's trademark cinematography.Well balanced, and occasionally riveting, vintage Hitchcock.NB Note A.H.'s obsession with taxidermy, seen four years on again in "Psycho".Thursday, February 25, 1993 - Video</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fun movie, but not his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie a lot, but I feel as if the screenplay was fairly weak. Most of the classic Hitchcock tricks are here and they are a lot of fun to watch. I think I laughed at a few moments when I should not have been just because some of the shots were just too Hitchcock. For example the appearance of the assassin at the hotel at the beginning. I absolutely loved the climax scene with the music. It really got under my skin and made me sit up. I think it is interesting how movies have forgot how opening credits can actually play a part in the movie. This movie was one of the best examples of how the opening credits fit perfectly into the movie. It was so perfect and I was just thinking as I watched the opening credits that this is pretty ridiculous, but forgot that Hitchcock does not just put that long of a shot up for no reason. I was surprisingly happy with the long singing sequence that Doris Day had with Hank. The acting was alright and it is hard to compare James Stewart, because some movies he is just perfect in and he did a really good job, it was not his best work. It is sad that since everyone has seen him at his best, it is easy to tell when he is not at his best. I liked Doris Day's scene when she was singing at the piano the best and I think she pulled off that scene very well. I must say one of my favorite shots was a little short and that would be the scene where Jimmy Stewart stands up in the church and you see the pastor in the foreground. Also the scene when he was lying at the front of the church. A lot of the movie is very well done, but being that it is a Hitchcock film one compares it to his other movies. I was thinking about how that the story told would barely fill a 20 minute TV show in our current state of entertainment, but Hitchcock was able to make it into a 2 hours movie. And did it very well I might add.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not one of his best, but still a fine thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to admit it, but I didn't find it to be one of Hitchcock's best but nonetheless a riveting, climatic thriller. In a remake of Hitchock's 1934 movie of the same title, Dr. Ben McKenna (James Stewart) ? the man who knows too much - and his wife Jo McKenna (Doris Day) are holidaying in Morocco with their son Hank (Christopher Oslen) when there is a case of mistaken identity and caught up in the web of an assassination plot. The conspirators go to extreme lengths to prevent them from interfering with their plot: kidnapping their beloved Hank.I found it surprising that Doris Day, who I usually associate with Rock Hudson comedies, was cast in a Hitchcock film. As I was watching it, I soon realized that this was more of a family film compared to Hitchcock's other works (example: Psycho) and she had singing ability needed to pull off "Que Sera Sera", which she did beautifully. She was well cast as herself and James Stewart had chemistry, which helped make the couple believable.In comparison to the great director's other works I believe this isn't as good, but it is still a exceedingly entertaining family thriller/mystery. There is also the added bonus of Que Sera Sera, which turned out to be a smash hit for Doris Day. Well directed, well acted. A fine film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been getting into the Hitchcock series very much lately. I find myself always renting one of his movies when I'm at Blockbuster or Hollywood Video. Like I said before, Hollywood is loosing it's touch incredibly, I needed a reminder that there are terrific films out there. Not to mention, I want to be a film appreciator, not a movie buff. Is there any better way to do that than with Alfred Hitchcock's movies? The Man who knew too Much is another great and exciting thriller starring Alfred's favorite leading man James Stuart and the woman who steals the show Dorris Day. They play husband and wife who go on vacation with their son, but when a spy tells James some information that could arrest another spy, his son is kidnapped and held for ransom. James seems to just doubt Dorris and her ability for ideas on how to get their son back, but she makes a great comeback and just about ends up being the hero of the flick.The acting again, I would say that Dorris was the one who outshined the whole cast. James did a great job keeping up, together these two made you sit down and never budge throughout the film. I loved the little bit of comedy at the end that Alfred added. You'll see what I mean. I would always highly recommend this film, despite not being the best Hitchcock film, it's still a treasure.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Stewart and Doris Day star as the married couple, Dr Ben and Jo McKenna, in Hitchcock's Hollywood re-make of his own 1934 British film, 'The Man Who Knew Too Much'. It's a nicely suspenseful, glossy product that fails to reach the heights of a 'Vertigo' or 'Notorious', but it's still a worthy film regardless.Ben and Jo are vacationing in exotic Morocco with their son Hank when they spy the mysterious man Louis Bernard on a bus. Unwitting Ben, a foreigner out of touch with the locals, allows himself to be befriended by the shady figure. The next day Bernard is murdered in the marketplace, but manages to leave Ben with some dying words that seem to outline details of an assassination plot planned in London. Ben is a man who knows too much, and now he finds himself embroiled in a multi-nation plot when his son is kidnapped by the assassins. The frantic couple decide that in order for them to ever see their son alive again, they must take action themselves and travel to London.Stewart is excellent as usual as the trademark Hitchcock protagonist caught unaware by circumstance. Stewart's ordinariness make him perfectly believable as a man trapped into something he has no control over. There has been much critical bashing of Doris Day's performance as wife Jo, but I find her more than adequate. She plays the distraught mother heart-wrenchingly well, we can feel her emotion as she searches for the thing most valuable to her. Day unavoidably must sing in this Hitch thriller, but 'Que Sera, Sera' is actually an effective plot device rather than just a gimmicky song. Watch to find out how Hitch uses it, it's quite subtle and brilliant.This was filmed in glossy Technicolour, and we can see that for once Hitch had a big budget to work with. It's a finely presented film, but it ultimately lacks the visual style and brilliance of Stewart and Hitchcock's final outing 'Vertigo'.Still, it is an improvement on the British effort and provides solid entertainment.7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, suspenseful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's one good suspenseful film, this is one of them. James Stewart puts on a dazzling performance as American Dr. Ben McKenna who, with his wife and son, are in Africa on tour. They stumble on a murder scene, and Dr. McKenna's son is kidnapped hours later.Before you can say, "Fasten your seat belts," Dr. McKenna finds out too much about a assassination attempt and tries to stop it. However, other people know he can be dangerous, (dangerous to them, that is) and try to dispose of him.Eventually, Hank, the son, is found alive and well.If you like suspenseful movies, this is the one to watch.My Score: 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very entertaining but I liked the original more in many ways,...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't among my favorite Hitchcock films, though I must admit it's still pretty good. Among the things I really liked were the presence of Jimmy Stewart (he always improves even the most mediocre material) and the incredibly scary looking assassin (who looks like a skeleton with just a thin layer of skin stretched over him). Although it cost the studio a lot of money, I didn't particularly care for Doris Day in the film--she seemed to weep a lot and belts out "Que Sera" like a fullback. Yes, I know that she was supposed to sing in that manner, but this forever made me hate this song. Sorry.The other complaint, though minor, I had about the movie was that it was a little "too polished" and "Hollywood-esque". The original version (also done by Hitchcock) just seemed a lot grittier and seedier--and this added to the scary ambiance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stewart and Hitchcock deliver international intrigue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again Hitchcock masterfully delivers suspense by placing ordinary people in extraordinary situations. Although I think Vertigo and Rope were better Hitchcock films that starred Stewart, I nevertheless heartily recommend The Man. Stewart was very convincing in his 'everyman' role as usual. I beg to differ with the commentator who was not impressed with Doris Day's performance. I thought she played the concerned mother and devoted wife perfectly and her rendition of Que Sera Sera was quite moving. Different strokes for different folks, I guess. The cinematography was also very beautiful to behold. The score wasn't quite as ominous as in other Hitchcock films but then again music was utilized as almost part of the plot itself so that might explain it. Excellent viewing experience, 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not one of Hitch's best (contains spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've not seen the 1934 original, so I can't compare this 1956 remake with the earlier version.The tension is certainly there in true Hitchcock style, especially in the Albert Hall assassination scene, but somehow the film seems wooden and dated.I can forgive it being dated - after all, it was made 45 years ago, and tastes and production techniques change: maybe artificial-looking back-projection really was the only way to film the scenes inside the bus and on the horse-drawn carriage straight afterwards. The London streets are far too quiet: where are the pedestrians, the traffic and the parked cars? And why do the aerial shots of the Ambrose Chapel look so obviously like a film set?However the wooden, underplayed response of Ben and Jo McKenna to the kidnapping of their son doesn't ring true and is less excusable: where is the anguish and despair? All we get is Jo McKenna's over-the-top reaction when she finds out that Hank has been kidnapped; why does Ben McKenna not seem to be at all perturbed? Having said that, Hank McKenna must be the most insufferably precocious child, even by American standards of insufferability and precocity!There are two plot holes which are never explained: how do the British police (Buchanan and Woburn) know that Hank has been kidnapped as soon as Ben and Jo arrive in London, since they have told no-one? And how does Jo know that someone is going to be assassinated at the Albert Hall and when it's going to take place? All she knows about the Albert Hall is that it's where she'll find Buchanan.The most memorable character by far - and it's a truly spine-chilling performance - is that of The Assassin: Reggie Nalder is superb, especially his sinister smirk when he tells Jo about Hank in the foyer of the Albert Hall.The film includes a couple of good lines:- When Hank and Louis Bernard are talking about eating snails, Hank quips "If you ever get hungry, our garden back home is full of snails. We tried everything to get rid of them. We never thought of a Frenchman!"- When the Ambassador is reprimanding the Draytons, he ironically says "You have muddled everything from the start, taking that child with you from Marrakesh. Don't you realise that Americans dislike having their children stolen?"Having said this, "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is a good story, told well. It's only in comparison with Hitchcock's other films that it suffers. For a good Hitchcock film, see "North By North-West" or "Frenzy" (his best, IMHO).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Doris Day has put in great performances in Teacher's Pet, By The Light Of The Silvery Moon, Young At Heart, among others -- but all are the same light comedy, musical, or musical comedy. This let her been seen as an actress. When she learns her son has been kidnapped you want to cry with her she's so great. James Stewart puts in his usual great Hitchcock performance but is blown off the screen with the strong presence of Doris Day. Hitchcock performing his magic again with the artful murder scene in the Morocco Marketplace and the chilling suspenseful climax at the end at the Royal Albert Hall. The funny thing is Doris Day never won an Academy Award, surely this among all her other performances could have won her an Oscar. A Hitchcock gem. ***1/2/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This shows how Hitchcock spoiled us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming from almost any other director this film would surely be considered a masterpiece: a complex, involving thriller with brilliantly directed, suspenseful set-pieces (the Marrakesh market, the Albert Hall). But the director is Hitchcock, so this film doesn't measure up to North By Northwest; Psycho; Rear Window, etc. etc.What particularly caught my attention was the eerie emptiness of the London streets where Stewart and Day search for their son - these people are out of their usual environment, isolated and helpless.It surpasses the 1934 version in terms of plot and characterisation, whose best scene (not used here) takes place in a dentist's surgery. James Stewart gives his character an edgy high-strung quality, while Doris Day makes a very effective Hitchcock leading lady. (This may be heresy, but I would have been very interested to see how she would have played Marion Crane in Psycho. I think audiences would have been even more tortured by the sight of Doris on the run than they were with Janet Leigh.)Perhaps this isn't top-notch Hitchcock but it's miles better than anyone else!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock tops himself as only he can!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This breathtaking film is unfortunately overshadowed and neglected due to some of the master's other great works, but in certain aspects is actually one of his most powerful films. I haven't seen the film in several weeks it seems, but I can still hear Doris Day's angelic voice echoing throughout the walls of my memory as she unleashes the epic sounds of her immaculate rendition of que sera sera. The timing of the cymbals is extremely well choreographed and Hitchcock assisted by the very capable hands of Bernard Herrmann uses music in a way that it's effectiveness and beauty is actually comparable to his visual mastery. Hitchcock also manages to once again implant a device in which one of the main characters (Jimmy Stewart) utilizes his expertise in his occupation in a practical manner. The scene in the church is truly unnerving creating emotions of intense frustration and extreme anxiety in the way only the master of suspense can and it also embodies the mood and atmosphere that the film has to offer, (In a way it is one of the classic Hitchcock moments that if you are watching carefully enough you'll never forget.) The thing that strikes me upon watching this film is something that runs through the veins of the auteur's body of work, and that is his ability to create intense emotional responses through the means of pure cinema. Unfortunately, I will most likely only be heard by those that already identify with my feelings towards Hitchcock and his work, but this film as much or more than any other transcends the suspense genre, and it along with many of his other films is so much more than a suspense film, and if that's all the viewer can see it as then perhaps it has something to do with the shallowness and superficiality of the viewer and not the filmmaker for Hitchcock if any filmmaker ever was is very deep. His films are effective and powerful on so many levels and this one is no exception. Hitchcock is cinema and this unheralded film is a testimony to not only the power and beauty of Hitchcock, but cinema itself.</fullReview>

But they start to realize that the only way to get Hank back is to stop the assassination plan.My favorite part is when Ben, Hank and Drayton are walking down the stairs, and the camera moves back and forth to each person. It puts you in suspense, and you don't know who is going to make the first move."The Man Who Knew Too Much" is a wonderful movie, and I think any Alfred Hitchcock fan should see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is indeed classic Hitchcock - a gripping and characteristically well-executed tale composed of just the right mix of humor, suspense, and irony. I hardly feel justified in faulting this film on any point, though one might conceivably point out that it does take a lengthy period for it to really get started, with the inevitable effect that it does tend to drag a bit at times. It might also be argued, however, that this is simply part of Hitchcock's genius - allowing the viewer to get comfortable before immersing them in the action.</fullReview>

What is even more splendid about this film is the added ingredients of Doris Day and James Stewart. Perhaps there is a planet somewhere that has a rule whereby all films should be directed by Hitchcock, and star Doris and Jimmy....now that would be a place worth a visit! And the icing on the cake....a brief appearance by the legendary Richard Wattis near the end. If you don't know who this screen great is, get looking on IMDB now!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, like a lot of Hitchcock's films, is dated by the equipment used during production. But beneath the graininess of the picture, and static in the sound, this movie is one of the best suspenses of the 50's. The only reason I don't exaggerate my love for this particular film, is because it has been killed by newer technology. You could tell me this film was made in the thirties right after the 'Lady Vanishes' and I'd believe it. Unfortunately classics seem to fade more and more as we expect better quality from films. This is sad, but this great movie is going to be forgotten because of a cgi dinosaur or a spacecraft making the jump into hyperspace.</fullReview>

Totally predictable and boring movie. No sense at all. Just a little example of the awfulness of the movie : The wife who becomes suspicious even at the little details like the Bernard person who talks to them in the bus, observe everything and thinks she is a genius. In the marketplace she gives her own child to the stranger who she just met and she met that couple even after Bernard. Such a stupid plot. If all of Alfred's movies are like this 'the so called suspense'...i will never recommend his movies to anyone.The worst suspense movie I have ever seen. Do not waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A married couple, travelling with their young son in Morocco, hear of an assassination plot against a foreign dignitary visiting London. Their son is kidnapped and held hostage to keep them quiet.Another beautifully photographed, globe-trotting Hitchcock; the screenplay seems a bit more detailed, with more nuances to the characters, but slower moving than some other of his films. And Morocco? I've worked with Moroccans for two years now, and I'm burnt out on their customs and culture. I felt like I was at work while watching the over extended dinner scene. Look, there's another tagine. I cannot figure if it is a large or extra large size? Look, there's another jellaba. It looks like a size 1.55 metre. It was most distracting, and hampered my enjoyment of this one. Hitchcock knew better than to have such an obvious red herring in the confusion regarding Ambrose Chapel, yet here it is anyway.Peter Lorre was sorely missed; singer Doris Day seems oddly miscast, and the song is a bit distracting, but at the same time fairly important to the plot. Good climax at the Royal Albert Hall makes this worth watching, unfortunately, the film goes on about ten minutes after that. This overlong denouement greatly lessens the effect of the climax itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet." - Timothy 2:12Alfred Hitchcock directs "The Man Who Knew Too Much" (1954), a remake of his 1934 film, "The Man Who Knew Too Much". Of the remake, Jean Luc Godard would remark, "This is perhaps the most improbable of Hitchcock's films, but also the most realistic." His sidekick Truffaut would offer: "the first version is the work of a talented amateur, the second a professional." Both are right. The plot? Whilst visiting French Morocco, Ben and Jo McKenna (Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day) learn that their son Hank has been kidnapped and taken to London. The boy is being used to buy the couple's silence pertaining to an assassination plot directed against a visiting foreign dignitary. Ben and Jo travel to London and attempt to rescue the boy. Much suspense ensues.The plot's incredulous, but the McKennas never behave like anything other than a real married couple. Doris Day in particular turns in one of Hitchcock's best female performances, as she frets and agonises over her missing kid. And of course Hitch's couples often mask trouble behind composure. Like many of Hitchcock's female leads, who often find themselves brutalised by society's strictures and male prerogatives, Jo reveals that she's ditched a fulfilling singing career to be but a doctor's dutiful wife. This acquiescence is straining the couple, who at times seem to embody the bleak "future" of the couple in Hitchcock's "Rear Window", another film starring Jimmy Stewart (and another in which a woman must make a concession in order to be with her man). "One of the reasons I came to Marrakesh is so I could say things without people hearing us," Ben says, hinting at marital cracks. Elsewhere Jo says, "Is this going to be our monthly fight?" Later Ben gives Jo some medical pills. "Six months ago you said I took too many of these," she growls. The kidnapping plot seems to temporarily save the crumbling marriage.The film is full of theatres and subterfuge, the sham of Ben and Jo's union echoing the film's dreamy aesthetic, with its theatres, theatre houses, fake-costumes, fake-performances and characters who wear invisible and visible make-up, masks and veils. The couple's son is even perversely hidden in a chapel, and the bad guys disguise themselves as priests, mild-mannered women or friendly faces. Aesthetically, the film looks gorgeous. Hitchcock's brand of High Modernism ? German Expressionism meets Soviet Modernism meets lurid opera meets 1950s pop art/advertising/high-fashion ? never really dates. His shot selection, cutting and camera work remains impeccable, and the film possesses a number of stand-out sequences, like several in which Doris Day sings "Que Sera Sera" (a song which cleverly encapsulates the passivity forced upon Jo), some wordless investigations, and the two gut wrenching moments in which father and mother learn, separately, of Hank's disappearance. The film, like many of Hitchcock's thrillers, would lay the foundation for over a century of subsequent "kidnapping", "blackmail", "ransom" and/or "domestic thriller" flicks.The film's last act contains perhaps its most well know sequence. Here Hitchcock serves up an audacious, ten minute, near "silent" sequence in which Jo stands at a Royal Albert Hall vomitorium and agonises over whether or not to hinder an assassination. If she stays quiet, her son survives. If she raises her voice, the visiting dignitary survives an assassination attempt but her son dies. As the London Symphony Orchestra plays Arthur Benjamin's "The Storm Clouds Cantata", Jo stands behind the concert audience and agonises over her dilemma. Like an opera singer, her face contorts as she enacts her own private tragedy. Her performance here is a bit of off-stage theatricality within the theatre, the Orchestra underscoring her quandary.Writing of this sequence in the book "Hitchcock's Music", author Jack Sullivan says, "we hear nothing; all speech is obliterated by music, which refuses to recede to the background. The audience was to hear Ben and Jo's abrasive exchange, as well as other dialogue in the lobby, but during shooting Hitchcock asked everyone to stop talking: 'Why don't you cut the dialogue and let us hear the music?' he said. Everyone on the set thought he had lost his judgement, if not his marbles, but once the talk was eliminated the sequence became strangely compelling." Of course Hitchcock loved wordless sequences and always tried to keep things as visual as possible. But Jo's dilemma at the theatre echoes the very dilemma of her marriage. She gives up a career as a singer to stay with Ben. Her marriage and her boy's survival then literally rests on a ban on her vocal chords. Speaking, singing and yelling ? opening her mouth makes everyone around the poor girl uncomfortable ? is expressly forbidden. The film's grand irony is that it is Jo's voice, her speaking, singing and yelling - her denied female subjectivity - which then goes on to both foil the assassination plot and rescue Hank. The latter occurs in the film's climactic sequence, in which Jo's singing inadvertently saves her son. "Suspense is like a woman," Hitchcock once said. "The more room she leaves to the imagination, the greater the emotion and the expectation." Hitch loved to conceal rather than display, but his female characters often themselves struggled to assert their voice. Why? It's like the film's title covertly implies; Men think they know everything.In terms of flaws, the film overuses rear projection (on the flip-side, the "unreality" of rear-projection always works in Hitch's favour, amplifying his Expressionism), drifts too far away from psychodrama and into conventional thriller territory, its climax is overlong (full of dull talking and ponderous villains) and the film's much lauded Royal Albert Hall sequence is poorly cut, done better in Hitchcock's 1934 original.8.5/10 ? Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Review is about Alfred Hitchcock's "The man who knew too much", starring Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day. To begin with I'm a fan of Mr. Hitchcock, I have seen a great number of his films. Though this is not as riveting as say "North by Northwest", it was a great film especially considering how old it is. Well the premise is now something that has been done to death by Hollywood, a family on holiday gets mixed up in international intrigue involving an assassination plot, and the chase is on to stop the assassin just in time. In this case the parents need to save their son from impending doom as well. However, Mr. Hitchcock is the master and the master is in top form creating suspense and drama at every turn. An interesting moral dilemma is well played also throughout this film. While I was watching this film I was reminded of one of my favorite comedies from the 70's called "foul play". It turns out that this film was an homage to Hitchcock and they based a crucial scene from "the man" in "foul play". I think this is also the origin of the famous use of Doris Day singing "que sera sera". Also, look for Hitchcock he's in there as usual, hard to spot though. Well, if you are a fan of suspense, old films, spy thrillers, or Hitchcock you should be sure to enjoy this good film as well. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start: I have never seen the original 1934 version of The Man Who Knew Too Much, so I'm not able to compare the two. All I can say is that I really liked this one.The story is very basic: A well to do American couple (played by the inevitable James Stewart the lovely Doris Day) is vacationing in Morocco, where their son is kidnapped and taken to London. This is because the father stumbled upon some information about an assassination that is to take place in the near future. Of course they're not to inform the police, etc. They follow the trace of the hoodlums to London, where they try to rescue their son.As always in his films, Hitchcock excels in building the tension by using the conflicting worlds: one world where everyone seems to act normal and business is as usual, while at the same time a drama unfolds. This kind of tension is often missing from modern day thrillers. Hitchcock also makes a great deal of the dilemma the parents are faced with. As the moment of the assassination draws nearer and nearer, they realize that the lives of two hang in the balance. This tension reaches its masterfull conclusion in the famous Royal Albert Hall sequence, where Day proves to be a very convincing leading lady. It's one of Hitchcock's best scenes (the obvious inspiration to Scorseses Key to Reserva).It is not one of Hitchcock's very best (it ends rather odd, not to say hasty and the storyline is not really brilliant anyway), but it is basically an almost flawless production. Scenery and cinematography are great and so are Stewart and Day. In fact I find them the best Hitchcock-couple I have seen so far (North by NW is close). Highly recommended to anyone who likes to enjoy good film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Successful thriller despite its strictures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Doris Day and Jimmy Stewart give all-before-them A-list performances in a thriller which has real problems on screen. A 'musical' Hitchcock, the plot hinges on set pieces with specially written scores. One is a classic screw-turning climax during a concert performance at the Royal Albert Hall; the other, the hit song 'Que Sera, Sera' is a function of the denouement. In the familiar vernacular of Hitchcockian suspense, these function well enough. Yet neither seem entirely at home. Overstatement is the simplest way to describe the insistence with which we are presented with the music in either case - both pieces are caught in a dangerous hinterland where they neither underscore the drama nor consist of it. Other irritances include a number of loose ends and some strangely protracted and over-cut sequences often in unsuccessful pursuit of suspense.As I say, the acting cuts through much of the muddle. Jimmy Stewart is a multi-faceted screen man, affable as well as ferocious. His comic sense serves him best alongside the bright-eyed Day. My favourite character is Reggie Nalder's assassin Rien, poised, sly and disconcerting still on screen. However, I can't imagine anyone has quite the acrid charm of Peter Lorre, so I'll be checking out Hitchcock's first effort at the next opportunity. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard some pretty promising things about this film... about the tension in it, about the realistic and credible premise and especially about the climax at London's Royal Albert Hall. I was quite disappointed with the film I got. The film starts out fine, with Stewart and Day coming across at a perfectly credible married couple, getting into minor fights and slipping snide comments directed at each other into polite conversation with other people. Vacationing in Morocco, they're drawn into a conspiracy. Not long after, they start figuring out who's behind it... and this is where the problems begin. The mystery is so simple a child could figure it out. Hitchcock tries to drag it out, to make it last longer, but it only serves to make it even more obvious. The real problem here is that not only is it incredibly simplistic, it's illogical. The actions of these people don't make sense. Alfred throws out any sense of realism for the last couple of scenes and opts for some mild suspense and tension instead, sacrificing any credibility in the process. I could go into more detail, but not without not spoiling it. The plot is fair. The acting is good, for the very most part. The pacing is OK, for the first hour or so. All in all, probably the least enthralling and believable of Hitchcock's more well-known and popular thrillers, but worth a viewing or two, I suppose. I recommend this only to very big fans of Hitchcock, Stewart and/or Day. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Better remake of Hitchcock's earlier work, although not as thrilling as his other films. Day &amp; Stewart are the American couple vacationing in Morocco, where they stumble upon an assassination plot against a British ambassador, which in turn leads to the kidnapping of their son. Once again, the Albert Hall climax is probably the most riveting moment of all. *** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second-rate Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is much more dated than most Hitchcocks, probably because the looser structure doesn t lend itself to the psychological acuity that papers over the cracks in the greater works. Or maybe because Doris Day - consistently sunny here even at the moments of greatest trauma - is so imperfect a medium for any serious thematic work that it wasn't even worth trying. The occasional moments evocative of other Hitchcock movies (Stewart's shocking close-up as Gelin falls dead in his arms; Stewart climbing up the bell tower to escape from the chapel; the assassin's fall to his death) seem uncomfortably stark and piercing in the undemanding overall context. The movie's best moments are mainly comic - Stewart's discomfort in the Marrakesh restaurant; the showbiz friends who visit Day in her hotel suite and are kept waiting for hours while Stewart and Day dash off in pursuit of their son. But the plot, with its reliance on whispered words of dying men, coincidental sightings and a lot of stuff that doesn't make much sense at all (it's a massively improbably train of events), in the absence of much irony or subtext, consigns it to the ranks of the second-rate.</fullReview>

Younger audiences may not be interested in a film like this but should take a look to see another Hitchcock masterpiece with intrigue, suspense and twists and turns in the plot.

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock lite -- suspense for the entire family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No great director makes the same film over and over, just as no great actor plays the same role; they like to experiment. And so you should not expect The Man Who Knew Too Much to be a clone of some other Hitchcock movie that you especially liked. Each film should be judged individually. After the very dark Rear Window, Hitchcock had just made To Catch a Thief and The Trouble with Harry, two lighter films, before making this film. The truly scary Psycho was four years in the future. I think The Man Who Knew Too Much was intended to be a bit lighter than some of his thrillers, though still suspenseful. You have a clean cut American family with a young boy on vacation, and I think that was the intended audience: families and their children down to about 10 years old. I am not certain now when I first saw this on TV, but I think I was a kid, and enjoyed it. On the other hand, parents in the 1950s probably would not take their children to see a story about a neighbor hacking up his wife and burying her in the garden, namely, Rear Window. This is Hitch lite for the Fifties.The year was 1956, and the baby boom had begun nine months after the end of the war, around 1946. So there would have been millions of families like the McKennas with fathers who had served overseas, and with children around 10 years old. And they wouldn't really want to hire a baby sitter to go to the movies, it would have been easier to take the kids. That's who this movie is aimed at; sometimes I think Hitch really aimed at 10 year old boys, to scare the bejeezus out of them. There is a dreamlike quality to this movie, as though your worst subconscious fears have come to life. Reality isn't what it seems, an old Hitchcock device. As in a dream, the British couple keep morphing, from friends to fiends, from deacons to assassins. The Frenchman turns into a peasant Moroccan and back. You can't go to the police, and when you finally do, they move very slowly, don't quite believe you, and leave. In the seemingly safe world of the Fifties, Hitchcock is saying danger still lurks, especially in the world beyond America's borders. The Man Who Knew Too Much is filled with Hitchcock's iconic imagery, such as the marvelous scene in the taxidermy shop (the main bit of humor) or Jimmy Stewart escaping from church by climbing up the bell rope, and more that might give away the plot. Doris Day certainly had a lovely voice, and the song Que Sera Sera was an enormous hit. I remember my older sister singing it all the time, as though it were some profound philosophical statement. Day fits the role perfectly, as the mother every little boy would love to have, and her dramatic acting is impeccable. This may have been the height of her acting career. She got a raw deal in later roles that left her typecast; she could really act. I heard her interviewed on the radio the other day about a compilation of her recordings that had be re-released, and she didn't sound bitter.Bernard Herrmann, who wrote so much great background music for Hitchcock films, including North by Northwest, and was a respected minor classical composer, was given the opportunity to write a new work for the concert hall scene with orchestra and chorus, certainly a composer's dream. But he chose to re-use the composition by Arthur Benjamin from the 1934 original version, which was the respectful thing to do, especially since Benjamin was still alive (he died in 1960). Having seen this film several times, and listening to the Benjamin composition closely, I can say it is actually a pretty good classical work, worthy of being performed in concert. The words sung by the chorus tie in somewhat with the scene; they also remind me of the forest storm scene in Bambi.The problem with Hitchcock films is you only get to see them the first time once. A review should really be written after that first time, not decades later. As best I can remember, I found it very suspenseful that first viewing. I can still feel some of that suspense when I watch it now, perhaps because the scenes are so skillfully constructed. It is interesting to watch now and then, to examine the fine Hitchcock detail more closely, to enjoy the fine acting. It is not as effective as his masterpieces like North by Northwest of Vertigo on these subsequent viewings. But it is a pleasant, enjoyable film, as long as you don't use a magnifying glass to examine all the lose threads.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Razor-Sharp Chain of Thrills by Alma Reville's Brilliant Husband</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Master of Suspense engineered some energetic thrillers with his prescription of mystery and suspense, and he made international intrigue trendy when it was getting an unpleasant reputation. He practically schooled critics in the skills and finesse of the chase, as well as the power of cruelly withholding crucial information (from his characters and from us) and engaging the emotions of the audience. So let's not make any negative assumptions that we cinephiles tend to make about remakes. To find that the son of a green grocer has cunningly merged his long-standing design and the prevailing screen developments of VistaVision and color in his 1955 picture is not at all to say that he has compromised the freshness of his original vision or revamped an old formula purely to the end of the almighty dollar. It is the opposite, a contemporary reflection on his earliest masterworks, those drum-tight thrillers of the original version's era.The plot is sinewy and graceful. The film starts virtually as a travel brochure, and pacifies you into an effective comfort as you become acquainted with the ordinary American family that comprises the picture's leads. By the time the tension hits, you're genuinely concerned with the plot. An American family are visiting the attractions in Marrakesh, Morocco (this is where the picturesque matter comes in), when unexpectedly a Frenchman is killed without compunction before their eyes. Expiring, the Frenchman murmurs an obscure implication to the man, who happens to be a doctor. This makes him the man who knows too much. That's the launch of the whodunit. The chase trails close on its heels, comprising two hours of MacGuffins and forceful scenes, one of the most unabashed adventures the Master ever made.The Master's sense of humor is channeled through the homegrown American fish-out-of-water thread that makes up the film's deceptively unassuming exposition, for instance their marital scrapes and their jaded sightseeing. The dialogue determines the family as pleasant, although wife Doris Day seems just a little mistrustful. During a negligible confrontation on a bus, the family meets a Frenchman who asks them to dinner, but suddenly calls off the rendezvous and then appears at the same restaurant as James Stewart and Day, a hilarious scene as the lanky, dyed-in-the-wool Stewart finds customary Moroccan dining to be trying.Day is startlingly moving as the mother who is hysterical about her child. The Old Ignatian's loathing of the police is clear throughout, as ineffective officers dismiss the family's dilemma. Much in the vein of the Knighted film pioneer's thrilling British thrillers, I love the way music plays such a vital role in the film and yet there's relatively little score, as was the case with The Lady Vanishes. Indeed, one of Hitch's most melodious films, music vital to this movie from the first frame. The clang of the cymbals will be employed to cover an assassin's gunshot. And Day's Que Sera, Sera is employed in both the frivolous moments of the movie and as a sniveling flare for her abducted son by which to pinpoint her.It's the sort of wit that could de-vein a shrimp that marked the Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire's earlier classics, particularly the most visceral ones which streamline the excitement, like Lady, The 39 Steps and Saboteur. Shedding the sagging gloss of his Selznick productions and going back to basics, he turned out this enormously and especially engaging action thriller with first-rate performances that he employs as suspense tools in and of themselves in a succession of skillfully framed and firmly directed scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The composer would have appreciated that"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock's 1956 version of The Man Who Knew Too Much differs little in plot outline from the original British-made film which Hitchcock also directed over two decades earlier. However this one comes from a very different era in the career of The Master of Suspense?. By now, Hitchcock was an established brand, and audiences knew what to expect when they went to the cinema, just as his fans today know what to expect when they put on the DVD or tune in for the afternoon movie. This reputation actually enhanced his craft, because it allowed him to be succinct in his storytelling, as well as affording him opportunities to be playful with those audience expectations. But it was also a reputation that was earned by the very direct appeal he had to audiences in the first place.Although Hitch was never much involved with screen writing, one area in which he liked to either confirm or confound our preconceptions was in casting. There's a real masterstroke here with the selection of Bernard Miles and Brenda De Banzie as the sinister Draytons. They wouldn't have been amazingly well-known at the time, especially in the states, and while their face value is one respectability one can also believe their villainy. There is no such ambiguity about Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day, both of whom were strongly established as good guys, and instantly acceptable as good guys even if one wasn't familiar with them. You know you are on their side from that very first shot on the bus. They don't make an obvious choice as a couple, but they actually look very natural together despite a fourteen-year age gap. Stewart skilfully brings out some darker elements to his persona (prefiguring his performance in Vertigo), even coming across as possibly malevolent under pressure. Day's performance is more average but her stirring rendition of Que Sera, Sera brings a real note of poignancy to the finale. The only fly in the ointment is Christopher Olsen as the boy Hank, who is distinctly irritating and unlikely to elicit much sympathy for being kidnapped.Hitchcock's visual approach was always to tell the story with as much clarity as possible, and with as much impact on the audience as possible, and he was able to do this primarily through visual means. The Man Who Knew too Much begins, as so many later Hitchcock pictures did, with a simple bit of silent narrative, beginning with a close-up of the archetypal American family who are to be our heroes, then slowly pulling back to reveal their surroundings amid the distinctly costumed people of an Islamic country, followed by a neat cut to the outside of the bus which reveals the location as Marrakech. One of his most effective shots happens later on in the scene where De Banzie turns up at the chapel. We see her gradually approaching down the aisle, and when she finally gets as far as Jimmy and Doris she is looking directly into the camera. This comes as a real surprise because up to that moment it wasn't clear it was a point-of-view shot. Even the humour in this picture is founded in Hitchcock's imagery, for example the clever placing of that menacing tiger's head at the taxidermist, or the cymbals player's almost totally blank sheet music.Hitchcock's style is so wonderfully engaging, so purely pictorial, that above all things it makes a picture like The Man Who Knew Too Much such an easy watch. Every character and detail of the plot is plainly laid out for us, and we are able to get nicely stuck into the suspense without getting confused about what is going on. This must have been a real treat for audiences in the 1950s, when thrillers were typically mysterious and convoluted affairs. What really made Hitchcock such a well-known public figure was quite simply his effective understanding of the public.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Build-Up But Then Fizzles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) starts off as classic Hitchcock -- an innocent man caught up in a series of circumstances he doesn't understand or control. But the payoff is so unreal and understated, the film never packs the climactic wallop that it should. (A few plot spoilers may follow).For instance, if you went into a church and saw the kidnappers of your child, would you just stand there, act cool and sing hymns? Of course not -- you'd raise a ruckus and go right after them. Likewise -- if you heard your missing child signaling you at a function, would you again just hang out as if nothing was happening? Certainly not.That's why this movie, while starting out great, didn't work for me. I kept waiting for the emotional climax of Stewart &amp; Day finding and rescuing their child, and it really didn't happen.There are also many dated sexist themes here -- Stewart giving drugs to calm Day before he tells her bad news, and her giving up an international acting career so he could be a Dr. in Indiana.Overall, worth a view, but if you want really good Stewart &amp; Hitch, go for Vertigo. BTW, not a Doris Day fan, but she didn't bother me at all.</fullReview>

It's also a peculiar testimony to the decline of the female movie image from the 30's to the 50's. In the original, our heroine is a crack shot, playing competitive sport, whose skills are vital to the final rescue. In the remake she's reduced to Doris Day, former singer turned plain hausfrau, who manages only a sappy bit of warbling for her child. The original is also much more amusing, with much more of the witty byplay that marks Hitchcock's best thrillers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I put this second version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" to my Top 10 Hitchcock movies. Together with "Frenzy", it's probably the most argued film among the fans of Hitchcock. I consider it far better than, say, "Rebecca", which has gained unreasonably much appreciation.The film contains many ingenious scenes (most of them have been mentioned in other reviews), but that's something to be expected from Hitchcock. It takes almost half an hour until things really start to happen, but that time is used for preparing the following happenings, which are full of intriguing suspense.If you can ignore the clumsy rear projections, the only weakness of this film is the main villain, played by Bernard Miles, who is a rather flat and undeveloped character. Luckily, there is a creepy assassin in the form of Reggie Nalder. And Hank, the little boy, isn't as irritating as most kids in old movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another Hitchcock picture that is high on suspense and intrigue. Doris Day impresses in one of her few dramatic roles and is matched by Jimmy Stewart's usual finesse.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock's mastery of suspense is widely appreciated and his genius often referenced by countless film-makers, both past and present. For me, The Man Who Knew Too Much doesn't quite match his best work, but still showcases all the trademarks that make him such a revered figure in cinema to this day.This was the second time that the acclaimed director had brought this story to the screen, the first being in 1934. It was by no means a straight remake of his first interpretation and the differences are many, with some aspects updated, others changed completely. Even the narrative itself is markedly altered, though the broad strokes of the plot remain intact.As is the case here, the collaborations between Hitchcock and Jimmy Stewart are numerous and generally very successful. The director liked to use him so much due to Stewart's demeanour, embodying the average Joe and enabling audiences to put themselves in his characters' shoes much more easily. It's a feature that works especially well in this particular picture, though the archetype has evolved somewhat over the years since its production and he can sometimes come off a little gruff.The choice of Doris Day for the female lead caused some concern at the time, as she was never a name that was associated with dramatic roles. It's a shame in some ways that she was so closely aligned with musicals due to her vocal talents, as her work in the film is excellent, particularly in the more emotional scenes, which showed her to be a quite capable actress when the situation called for it. There are also one or two scenes with songs shoehorned in, but they are done tastefully and fit with her role as a retired star of the stage.The famous Royal Albert Hall scene is where the film reaches its peak and it has stood the test of time well. The tension remains intact and the desperation of Stewart's Dr. McKenna is palpable. The combination of the score (which Bernard Herrmann opted not to change from the first iteration, though he was given the choice) and precise, effective editing make it easy to see why it is considered such a classic.</fullReview>

They travel to London, the place where the assassination of a statesman is to take place, the place where their son is held captive, and try to locate and rescue their son. After several futile attempts, mainly due to the ambiguity of the address, they not only rescue their son but also avert the assassination.Hitchcock has, like always, brilliantly made a familiar plot and storyline an edge-of-the-seat thriller. Bernard Herman's loud and powerful background score adds to the impending suspense in the theater, during the assassination that goes awry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock grabbed at the chance to remake his 1934 British film, The Man Who Knew Too Much. In comparing the two films, Hitch told an interviewer, "Let's say the first version is the work of a talented amateur and the second was made by a professional." What a great film! The cinematography was beyond great. The building of suspense was at such a high pitch it made me nervous, an edge-of-your-seat thriller. But I'm getting ahead of myself. The basic plot has Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day star as a family at the end of their vacation in Europe, Dr. McKenna and "Jo", and their son Hank. Hank causes some trouble when he accidentally yanks a Moslem woman's veil off and her husband threatens McKenna. A suave Frenchman comes in and handles the confusion and tries to make friends. It turns out (we find later) that this guy is a spy and to make a long story short, he gets a knife coming out of his back and whispers his death message that a prime minister will be assassinated, tells him where and then dies. The couple the McKennas were with, the Draytons, are not who they seem either. They are the ones being spied on by Scotland Yard and kidnap Hank to keep McKenna's mouth shut. If he reveals what he knows of the assassination plot, his son will die. The story then becomes complex which I won't detail here. But there are several great scenes: McKenna mistakes "Chapel" for a person rather than a place and ends up accosting a man with that name in a taxidermy shop. After realizing his error he tries to leave but they hold him for the cops. Funny stuff. Doris Day gets to belt out her signature song "Que Sera Sera" which is a bit overdone. The climax occurs in an orchestral hall (Albert Hall) where the prime minister is listening, an assassin is in an adjoining box, and all our players are there. How will Jo stop the assassin? Will McKenna convince the cops of the plot and recover his son in time? And what about the boy? We do eventually find out who the mastermind is and we learn more about the Draytons. However, after all is said and done, we still do not know a lot about the embassy personnel, or if Drayton's wife was caught, or even that the conspiracy was found or not. Hitch just ends it, brilliantly. I think the best scene ever is where Doris Day is singing her Sera Sera song, and the viewer 'follows' the sound as each shot shows a carpet, a set of stairs, a hallway, a column, up and up, to Hank's room where he is being kept by the bad guys. The bottom line, great suspense, if a few plot holes and a little overdone on the musical interludes. Awesome, real acting from Jimmy Stewart. Nobody does it better. A great cast is worth repeating: James Stewart ... Dr. Benjamin McKenna Doris Day ... Josephine Conway McKenna Brenda De Banzie Lucy Drayton (as Brenda de Banzie) Bernard Miles ... Edward Drayton Ralph Truman ... Inspector Buchanan Daniel Glin ... Louis Bernard (as Daniel Gelin)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Stewart is Dr. Ben McKenna, an ordinary and respectable family man whose son is kidnapped, and who finds himself stuck, with his loving wife Jo, played by Doris Day, in the middle of a political conspiracy ? that's the pitch of "The Man Who Knew Too Much", Hitchcock's 1956 remake of his own film made 22 years earlier. And while not listed among the Master's usual Top 5, the movie works simply because it relies on two strong pillars: right use of actors and right use of music.I started with the synopsis to highlight the perfect harmony between the actors and the characters they're supposed to portray. James Stewart, for once, doesn't play an exaggeratedly strong or flawed character, he's at his best as the middle-aged man who just wants to spend a nice time with his family, and becomes more and more anxious and dangerous when the lives of his beloved ones are at stakes. Still, as a doctor, he's rational and wise enough to know how to keep his cool in critical situations but he also finds himself victim of his temper like in the famous wild-goose chase scene, when he meets the wrong Ambrose Chappel, a man whose name was meant to be a place.While Stewart is great, as usual, I concede it wasn't the most difficult role he had to portray, somewhat all the merit belongs to Doris Day as the good mother and caring and daring wife. Doris Day as Jo, a singer, perfectly embodies the dutiful qualities of 50's wives with a sense of dignity that prevents the role from falling into an involuntary sexist trap. Interestingly, she's the most distrustful one during the first trip in Marrakech as she finds quite inconvenient that they always meet the same French guy (Daniel Gelin), and gets more and more certain that they're followed, something that Ben doesn't buy. Despite the typically Hitchcockian paranoid undertones, the couple exudes a quiet All-American feeling of harmony.This is because the film is less about the classic conspiracy themes than this whole mindset, whose emotional pillar is the son, Hank, remarkably played by Christopher Olson. The highlight of this emotion is reached in an unforgettable scene where Doris Day outshines James Stewart when he tells her about the kidnapping, she has the perfect reaction as a mother who misses her son, and the tone is not melodramatic or over the top. It's one of these rare occasions where Family plays a significant role in a Hitchcock plot, after "Shadow of Doubt" and the solidarity and complicity between Stewart and Day, contributes to what is probably the best partnership in a Hitchcock film. Which leads me to the second pillar to the film: the music, what precisely embodied this very complicity is one my all-time favorite movie songs "Que Sera Sera, What Will be Will be", that Jo used to sing with Hank as a sort of code of mutual love that Hank always hums or whistles back.This is one of the rare movies that knew how to use music, so powerfully it became like a character. Its omnipresence probably caused the score to sink into oblivion, although the talented Bernard Herrmann, who makes a fitting cameo as the opera conductor, composed it. I guess too much music would have killed the effect, and Hitchcock who built suspense with the precision of a crafted watchmaker and the delicacy of a pastry cook, left the best part for one hell of a climax, when a simple cymbal crash would allow a killer to shoot the British Prime Minister. Inspired from a comic-strip story and presented in the opening credits, the using of the cymbal crash is the little extra-spice without which the movie wouldn't have been as memorable.Like the killer, we had the chance to hear twice the part during which the cymbals crash, enough to remember it, but not enough to be sure when it will come. This way, Hitchcock transforms a whole musical sequence in an extraordinary suspenseful sequence where we simply wait for something to happen while we don't know when it will happen, we only wait for the hints, which is a long silence, and we expect the protagonists to know it too, which doubles the thrilling effect of the build-up. This scene works so much because we enjoy both the mesmerizing beauty of the music and the heart-pounding intensity of the story, waiting for the climactic moment when they converge, in a sort of cathartic attempt to let us finally breath, when Doris Day screams and the killer misses his shot.Hitchcock did the perfect dosage of thrills, music and emotions and while it would have been good enough with the opera sequence, it brought another classic moment in the Embassy when Jo, sings the song "Que Sera Sera" a Capella so loudly she expects to hear her son reply, which he does, through a whistling that would ultimately save his life. A few movie songs play such a pivotal role, some are just fillers, some convey a message, and some simply define the film and beyond the clever use of this song for the plot, if only for having permitted to write such a beautiful melody and simple yet inspirational lyrics, "The Man Who Knew Too Much" deserves its popularity. The movie is not without its flaws and I suspect the presence of a few microscopic holes, I also could tell that the Moroccan people were not speaking the local dialect (being Moroccan myself), maybe the killer was too hideous in a caricatural way, but all these considerations hardly matter. Why? Because even though While "The Man Who Knew Too Much" might not be the best of Hitchcock, which is not saying much anyway, it's certainly the most emotional and the Master's greatest tribute to the irreplaceable power of music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>International Plot at the Albert Hall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man Who Knew Too Much is considered a lightweight among the work of its notable director Alfred Hitchcock. Nevertheless, after viewing it on two occasions, I consider it top notch entertainment with some gripping scenes as the fast paced thriller keeps the audience on edge until the end. It is a remake of a movie of the same name, made in the mid-1930's. I am only slightly familiar with the original, also directed by Hitchcock, but to me the remake is superior. The action begins slowly and allows the audience to get to know the American couple of Dr. Ben McKenna and his wife Jo Conway, a musical star. The humour of the family adjusting to being tourists in another culture made me warm up to the couple. They struck me as people you might like to meet if you were there. The couple is played by Doris Day and Jimmy Stewart, as innocents abroad with their young son Hank. Not entirely comfortable being away from familiar territory, they become unhinged once caught up in an international plot. They befriend a British couple, the Draytons (Brenda de Banzie and Bernard Miles) who pretend to be fellow tourists. The McKenna family tries to pursue the conspiracy which takes them from Morocco to London, where they visit some back streets and alleys in the British capital and eventually the Royal Albert Hall, where the climax of the movie takes place. Along the way, they stop at a neighbourhood in London, where we witness some surprising action spiced with droll wit. The harrowing finale at the Royal Albert Hall comes amid the grandeur of a great setting. I enjoyed this movie and as with most Hitchcock movies, I would gladly watch it again.Interesting trivia: On the billboard outside the Albert Hall, we see the name of the director of the London Symphony, Bernard Hermann, who wrote the music for many of Hitchcock's greatest movies. This is an alert to shrewd Hitchcock fans of his appearance in the finale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A top-class thriller with two top-class acts!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is definitely Hitchcock, you can see that from the very intro. It's an excellent film, and a thriller full of intrigue, foreign locations, and shady characters; all the right elements for a good edge-of-the-seat yarn, of which Hitchcock was the master. There is a good degree of tension throughout this movie as the conspiracy unfolds, and this is almost palpable toward the two climaxes, first at the concert hall, and again at the embassy. There are several comedic moments too, such as the bloke trying to save his swordfish in the taxidermist's workroom! Also, Caroline Jones pops up from time-to-time looking quite uncomfortable with her hair dyed blonde.A couple of interesting points in this film: Que Sera Sera is billed as "What will be" in the credits; and I've never seen Jimmy Stewart do comedy before, though he often does drop some quite witty lines in his movies, (with a bit of a smile), but the restaurant scene when his knees are up around his neck is a real crack-up, and he does it so easily that it is funny without being slapstick.Doris Day and Jimmy Stewart are brilliant together, and they take you on a ride through all the emotions, and of course, Doris gets to sing a couple of songs as well, (it wouldn't be a Doris Day film otherwise, would it?). This is an excellent pairing of these two Hollywood icons, and I find it a pity that they didn't do more work together. Any movie with their two names on the credits would make you buy it without you needing to know any more. So glad that I picked it up on DVD a few weeks ago for 75c in an op-shop, (charity shop)!!Oh, by the way - where is Hitch? Someone mentioned on the Message Board that they couldn't see him, and I couldn't spot him either, but I've read that he's in the crowd watching the acrobats. There's yet another reason to watch this movie VERY carefully! 10/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 2nd version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" has been unfavourably compared to the original, and this prevented me from seeing it until recently. Too bad. I prefer this to the earlier version. It must be the wonderful combination of Doris Day and James Stewart in this version, who work wonderfully together here. Having only seen Doris Day in such 60s fluff as Pillow Talk until now, I was surprised to see the depth and range of emotion she is capable of as an actress, here playing a mother dealing with the abduction of her son. I guess when one is dealing with a director of Alfred Hitchcock's prolific output and terrific talent, it is necessary to point out the flaws and failings of some of his less-than-great pictures; however, they are still miles better than most of the output of many other directors. Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day make this picture worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most underrated Hitchcock film of his golden era (roughly 1954 -1963),a decade during which he produced a masterpiece a year -the only film that is not really great ,IMHO,is "to catch a thief"-First of all ,the second version is far superior to the black and white one.In that version of the thirties ,we did not feel the love of the parents for their abducted child :remember the scene when the father was doing a meal justice when he did not even know if his daughter would be safe. Compare with that brilliant scene (my favorite in the whole movie)when Doris Day in a voice chocked with emotion,sings her famous "que sera sera",and her song reverberates in the whole mansion,just to reach her little boy.I simply do not know a better use of a song in a movie,if we except musicals of course.And the apparently schmaltzy words of this international hit gain an extraordinary emotional power.The actress/singer had already sung the song for her child at the beginning of the movie,which is almost prophetic.The scene of the concert is also a classic ,better than in the first version,a scene which was plagiarized lots of times.I really do not understand why people think it's inferior to "rear window" "north by northwest" or "the birds" or any of Hitch'c classic of that blessed period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the films Hitchcock remade. When I saw it I realized this remake is as strong as the original with a different cast.James Stewart always seems to do some of his best work with Alfred, &amp; I am not sure why. His acting in this movie is just perfect. He fits the role very well.This film represents one of the very few times Doris Day did a dramatic film. Hitchcock brings out one of her best performances here. It was really daring casting because Day had already become sort of typecast as a romantic comedy lead, but Hitchcock proves in this film she could do serious acting. I think Day even surprised herself in this movie.The plot in this varies very little from the original film except in the places it takes place &amp; some of the minor circumstances surrounding the plot. As is usual in the Hitchcock films, the photography is excellent &amp; the pacing is great.In a way, the ending of this movies reminds me very much of how the film North By Northwest ends. Both films have sudden endings which if you watching them for the first time surprise you.An oddity for an Alfred Hitchcock film- this one got an Oscar for Best song- Doris Day singing Que Sera Sera-Whatever will be, will be. It is woven very much as a device into the suspenseful plot in the last reels of the film though it is sort of introduced earlier in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Man Who Knew Too Much" falls into that Hitchcock middle ground that characterized many of his films during the 1950s: not a masterpiece of suspense by any means, but an awful lot of fun nonetheless.James Stewart and Doris Day play a vacationing couple who get caught up in a plot heavy on foreign intrigue. The famous climactic scene takes place at a classical music concert, where someone is going to be assassinated during a particular cymbal clash in the score. The impish Hitchcock of course lets us know what that point is, so that the race to stop the assassin becomes a nail biting race against the cymbalist.So much of this movie reminded me of the 1978 Chevy Chase/Goldie Hawn comedy "Foul Play" that I have to believe that film was inspired by this. Neither film is a big deal, but both are easy to enjoy.Grade: B+</fullReview>

The acting, especially Doris Day, who not only looks beautiful here (as a mother no less) is astonishing. As the scene approaches where Jimmy Stewart has to tell Doris that their son has been kidnapped is excellent. It's so good that you almost dread watching Doris totally break down that she needs sedated. There are also so many "famous" Hitchcock touches here including the sterile church scene and an albatross thrown in at a taxidermist's shop. The Royal Albert Hall scene seems a bit long but there's thrills right up to the very end. Not a toss away movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly exciting Hitchcock marred by extremely sluggish first third</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Opinion is generally divided on whether the 1936 original version or this 1956 remake is the better film. It's a lot slower paced ,with an extremely leisurely half hour build-up. Hitchcock lets us get to know the characters more, and dwells a great deal on the Marrakesh setting. However ,this somewhat 'heavier'approach does not really suit the story as well as, say, Vertigo or Rear Window. After a while we witness a terrific murder scene, but a great deal of time is wasted with some overlong pieces of talking.Nevertheless once we reach London, the film does kick into high gear. The comical struggle in a taxidermists is a poor substitute for the first version's dentist scene, but a church sequence is expertly staged and the lengthy Albert Hall scene is simply superb, brilliantly edited to Arthur Betjamin's Storm Clouds Cantata [conducted by Bernard Herrmann!]. As for the final sequence, it is quite suspenseful but somewhat anti-climatic and almost seems like just another excuse for Doris Day to sing Que Sera Sera.James Stewart and Day, in an usually dramatic role, are both very strong. It's basically average Hitchcock, which still means it's generally pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's Ugly Americans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Might be a little spoiler-y...Did Hitchcock purposefully make Stewart's and Day's characters (not to mention their irritating little boy) so gauche and brash and annoying? Not that I'm complaining; it adds to the texture of the work by setting up a wonderful parallel between the clueless, loud Americans who depend on their initiative (climbing out of a church on a bell rope, singing to reach an imprisoned child) rather than the help of others, and the quiet, savvy British couple pitted against them (note the scene in the restaurant where the people who turn out to be evil are gracious, helpful and unobtrusive, while Stewart especially seems to offend everyone). The parallel is further emphasized when Day's agony of indecision during the Albert Hall sequence is followed by Brenda de Banzie's anguish while Day sings "Que sara, sara" at the embassy, another woman desperately trying to figure out how to save a life during a musical performance. (Incidentally, for my money de Banzie's character is far and away the nicest person in the film.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people say the pace of this film is a little slow, but how is this different from any other Hitchcock movie? They all move very deliberately and, as a point, have spurts of suspense and brilliant montages injected through it. This movie gives us just the right amount of comic relief which make the suspense scenes seem all the more suspenseful. The Albert Hall scene is one of the best examples of Pure Cinema that exists in Hitchcock's collection (the best probably being almost all of "Rear Window"). Pure Cinema for Hitchcock meant a series of usually small pieces of film fit together without dialogue, in order to tell the story visually. This is, of course the basic definition of the Albert Hall sequence, as well as the shorter staircase sequence at the end of the picture. Not many slip-ups by Hitchcock here, and the acting is superb especially by Doris Day in a rather surprising serious role.</fullReview>

The film stars Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day as parents who get caught up in a political assassination plot and must try to get their kidnapped son back. They both give excellent performances, not surprising of course. Really, however, I was most impressed with Hitchcocks amazing use of music. The climax at the Opera house was fantastic, and using a live orchestra to create music and suspense at the same time was pure genius. Absolutely fantastic suspense came out of that scene. Also, the use of Doris Day singing "Que Sera, Sera" was excellent. Especially when it is transposed on scenes at the end of the film. So, this film to me ends up being Hitchcocks best use of music that I have seen to date. Unfortunately it had a slow start, or I could have recommend this film a little more highly. Even then, it is still well worth a look. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>better than the 1934 version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewers have long been divided as to which version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is the better. I personally prefer the second. Though it doesn't measure up to the likes of "Rear Window", "Vertigo" and "North by Northwest", it is vintage Hitchcock at his best. In the 1934 original a British couple are on holiday in Switzerland, become privy to sensitive information and, as a consequence, their teenage daughter is kidnapped. In the 1956 remake Stewart and Day are Americans on holiday in Morocco, inadvertently learn of an assassination plot, and have their ten-year-old son taken from them. The overall plot is more sophisticated in the second version, and, of course, the use of colour cinematography lends a certain visual depth lacking in the earlier film. However, the second version is not in every way superior to the first: much of its playfulness is sacrificed in the remake, which takes itself a little too seriously.Stewart is always a pleasure to watch in his films, and this one is no exception. Day is very good in her role as well, though she is hardly the cool blonde typical of Hitch's other films. In this respect Day's selection as female lead is perhaps a bit unexpected, although admittedly few other Hitchcock blondes are called upon to play the maternal role at which Day excels here. One can almost feel a mother's anguish when Day is told by Stewart that their son has been abducted. Her reaction is entirely believable. All the same, I was bothered to think that a trained physician would bribe his wife with tranquillizers before telling her the unpleasant news. This doesn't ring true.This film marks Hitchcock's second collaborative effort with composer Bernard Herrmann, who actually appears as himself in the Albert Hall sequence. But insofar as "The Trouble with Harry" is not a typical Hitchcock offering, this film might justly be considered the first of the great suspense movies created by the gifted duo. Herrmann's score is not as integral a part of the plot as it is in, say, "Vertigo" or "Psycho"; here it definitely remains in the background. Nevertheless it lends itself perfectly to the feel of the story as a whole and hints at greater things to come in those later films.I thought the shootout near the end of the 1934 film was heavy-handed and amateurish. It seemed like the work of someone stuck for a better way to resolve the plot. The comparable scene in this later version is more suspenseful?after all, there's no real suspense if you're already being shot at. But the use of Day singing what would soon become her trademark song at a foreign embassy is a questionable improvement. Both versions of this film should be seen. And then decide for yourself which is the better of the two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man Who Knew Too Much{1956}is a remake of a film that Alfred Hitchcock made in England in 1934 with the same name. In my opinion, his later effort is far superior. Many critics and fans of Alfred Hitchcock will argue that the remake is mediocre and doesn't have the spine tingling suspense of the original with Peter Lorre. In both films the plot is essentially the same, except the original is set in Switzerland and the remake in Marrakech . It tells the story of a married couple {James Stewart and Doris Day}vacationing with their young son and meeting a suspicious man, that is very curious about their past. It just so happens, he's an agent that's looking for a couple involved in a plot to assassinate a world leader.Then he gets stabbed in a Marrakeck market because of it being found out that he's a spy,and proceeds to fall into Stewart's arms.Dying,he tells him the whole story of the assassination plot.Stewart and Day then find out that another couple they met were the couple the agent was looking for and have kidnapped their son.The film contains excellent performances by Stewart and Day,in a straight dramatic role,as worried and frightened parents.This film proved that Doris Day could act in suspenseful dramas as well as carefree musicals.The direction by Alfred Hitchcock is top-notch.The film keeps you on the edge of your seat every minute.The scene in Albert Hall is a classic.The original is so slow-paced and drab.I don't know how people can compare the two.Just watch the remake and you'll enjoy it.I give the movie a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me this movie falls apart about two-thirds of the way into the movie. Up until this time, we have witnessed classic Hitchcock, complete with intelligence, believability, and thoroughness. James Stewart is the perfect everyman (once again) who accidently gets caught in the middle of scandalous murder. (Potential Spoilers) It is up to him to right what was not his wrongdoing in the first place, a not so easy task when your son is kidnapped and will allegedly be killed if you attempt to speak on what you know. (End Spoilers) The plot buildup is executed perfectly, with all the "everything that can go wrong for the protagonist has gone wrong" elements tremendously stacked. However, then the film becomes static during the Albert Hall sequence. For me, instead of the suspense building as more and more time elapsed (after all, we know what is about to happen, so the suspense should be building), I felt rather anxious, as if to say, "Get on with it already." Why? Because I knew what was about to happen. This time the Hitchcockian buildup didn't work. Furthermore, the conclusion drags on far too long. It's too anticlimactic. The antagonist is out of the picture, yet this picture continues for about fifteen more minutes until it is sure of itself - it is finally resolved. Amusingly, then it just ends, just like that. Why wasn't this approach adopted for the film a couple of scenes earlier? This qualm aside, the first two acts of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" are a pleasure. If only the third act were tightened up, this would be another Hitchcock classic (if you do not consider it to be one already).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This breathtaking film is unfortunately overshadowed and neglected due to some of the master's other great works, but in certain aspects is actually one of his most powerful films. I haven't seen the film in several weeks it seems, but I can still hear Doris Day's angelic voice echoing throughout the walls of my memory as she unleashes the epic sounds of her immaculate rendition of que sera sera. The timing of the cymbals is extremely well choreographed and Hitchcock assisted by the very capable hands of Bernard Herrmann uses music in a way that it's effectiveness and beauty is actually comparable to his visual mastery. Hitchcock also manages to once again implant a device in which one of the main characters (Jimmy Stewart) utilizes his expertise in his occupation in a practical manner. The scene in the church is truly unnerving creating emotions of intense frustration and extreme anxiety in the way only the master of suspense can and it also embodies the mood and atmosphere that the film has to offer, (In a way it is one of the classic Hitchcock moments that if you are watching carefully enough you'll never forget.) The thing that strikes me upon watching this film is something that runs through the veins of the auteur's body of work, and that is his ability to create intense emotional responses through the means of pure cinema. Unfortunately, I will most likely only be heard by those that already identify with my feelings towards Hitchcock and his work, but this film as much or more than any other transcends the suspense genre, and it along with many of his other films is so much more than a suspense film, and if that's all the viewer can see it as then perhaps it has something to do with the shallowness and superficiality of the viewer and not the filmmaker for Hitchcock if any filmmaker ever was is very deep. His films are effective and powerful on so many levels and this one is no exception. Hitchcock is cinema and this unheralded film is a testimony to not only the power and beauty of Hitchcock, but cinema itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Controversial Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock's 1956 version of The Man Who Knew Too Much is a film that always sparks a lot of arguments. Many people feel that the genius that was Hitchcock erred by remaking this film which he first did in 1934. Others say it was better than the original and a classic. I have never seen the 1934 version, but the remake does have several good things going for it. Jimmy Stewart for one thing and a musical score by Bernard Herrmann. Doris Day's role is one that always sparks controversy. She does seem out of place in a Hitchcock movie just like Julie Andrews 10 years later in Torn Curtain. However, she gives maybe a better performance than Stewart. Of the 4 movies that Stewart did for Hitch, this one was definitely his weakest. Fans of Vertigo will recognize that the grey suit that Day wears for much of the film is the same one that Kim Novak would wear. No wonder Jimmy Stewart had an obsession with that thing! Bernard Miles sort of seemed out of place as the villain. All in all, this movie had some things that pushes it out of the top 10 movies of Hitchcock, but it still is worth seeing. It is mandatory watching for die-hard fans of Hitch like me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film with weaknesses, but a respectable effort from the master nevertheless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I doubt this is one of the best Hitchcock films, but it certainly isn't as bad as, say, Torn Curtain. It does have its weaknesses: a slow, uninteresting start with Stewart and his young son being rather overbearing. The character of Mrs. Drayton is inconsistent, going from pleasent to cold to good-hearted again with each time we see her, while the script doesn't give any reasons for her changes of heart. The film does not have either substance or subtlety. Some of the scenes of Day and Stewart driving do look fake. And, yes, the theme song is a rather inane choice, giving the circumstances, and Doris Day's performance of it just doesn't work. But, all told, once it gets going, it's pretty entertaining, with quite a bit of suspense. Stewart and Day perfectly adequate performances once they get into it. My favorite scene would probably have to be the one where Stewart is walking to the taxidermist's office, when his footsteps are being echoed... or are they? Watch for that one; it's a perfect example of the Hitchcokian touch, and though short, really should stand with the North by Northwest crop-duster scene and the shower scene from Psycho as a great example of Hitch's knack for creating suspense. Also, the Royal Albert Hall sequence, though it does drag, has some escalating tension. (Plus, the conductor is played be Bernard Herrman, the composer of the film and of other Hitchcock films, including Psycho.) It probably is under-rated, and even though it isn't the Master's best, you could do worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Man Who Knew Too Much" is one of Jimmy Stewarts best movies and one of his best performances as an actor. He plays his part in an excellent and academy-award-proposing way, serious and with unique style. Hitchcocks great thriller is quite exciting and shocking, a milestone of crime stories. Doris Day, who performs this excellent song "Que sera", acts as a good counterpart to Jimmy and shows her talent of acting. Finally, I want to say, that this is a movie I recommend for fans of classic acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not top-drawer Hitchcock, but pretty good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock's remake of his earlier British success, "The Man Who Knew Too Much" came at a time when the master of suspense was really on a roll artistically: "Strangers on a Train," "Rear Window," and "To Catch a Thief" preceeded it, "Vertigo," "North by Northwest," and "Psycho" would follow. While this film is not quite in the same class as these others, it's still pretty good, and one wonders why it was held back for a twenty year period. James Stewart, in about mid-point in his successful collaboration with Hitchcock, gives yet another excellent account of himself as a mild-mannered man caught up in an insane situation. Reggie Nalder is one of the out-and-out scariest Hitchcock villians ever as Mr. Rien, the assasin. That maggotty smile when he informs Doris Day that she has "a very nice little boy" is enough to make you shiver. It's clear that murder is one of the kinder things this man is capable of. Only his "Barlow" in "Salen's Lot" was scarier! The biggest suprise, though, is Doris Day's terrific performance, especially in the much-praised Royal Albert Hall sequence. She proves throughout that Hitchcock's confidence in her was not misplaced. Only one problem: The repititions, ad nauseam, of "That Song!" Diabetics beware, and I can't see how it could have won the Oscar for Best Song that year (fellow nominee "Friendly Persuasion" would have been my choice). Still and all, though, Hitchcock's second-rate is better than a lot of other people's first-rate (You don't believe me? Could any other director have made the warmed-over hash that was "Marnie" convincing?), and every Hitchcock buff should see this at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great Hitchcock film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much of a genius as Alfred Hitchcock was, there are times when I think he was an idiot. And one of those times is in this film, although the same problem shows up in several other Hitchcock films, including "North By Northwest" and "To Catch A Thief" (where the problem is so bad that even though it stars my favorite actor -- Cary Grant -- I won't watch the film. The issue -- "special effects". In this case, it's the back projection used for quite a few scenes...looking so cheap and fake...even though they were actually filming on location in Morocco.Aside from that, this is one of my favorite Hitchcock films. And I'm reviewing it today after upgrading to the fairly new Blu Ray edition. So the first question is -- is upgrading from the DVD to this Blu Ray worth it? It's somewhat grainy and skin tones are just a tad too red. But, it's not unpleasant to watch. Sometimes upgrading is an obvious choice, other times not at all, but here I'm undecided.There are so many good scenes in this film. The son falling on the moving bus and accidentally pulling off a Muslim woman's face veil. Jimmy Stewart's awkwardness at the Moroccan restaurant. Doris Day's acting (and the entire scene) when she learns her son has been kidnapped. The wonderful lunacy surrounding the mistaking of a religious institution (Ambrose Chapel) with a taxidermist (Ambrose Chappell), particularly in the taxidermy shop. The assassination scene. The "Que Sera" ploy.Aside from what I mentioned earlier about back projection, there's little to complain about here. Perhaps the 2 sentence ending of the film. Not unlike what Hitchcock did in "North By Northwest". In both cases supposedly funny, but I didn't find it so.Jimmy Stewart's "every man" persona is perfect in this film. I don't think this would have worked half so well with Cary Grant, even though I generally prefer Grant over Stewart. It's also interesting that Hitchcock adds a bit of suspense here by having the husband and wife NOT agree on quite a few things throughout the story. No actual arguments, but it is added tension to the plot.I would have to put this as Doris Day's best dramatic film, with the exception of "Love Me Or Leave Me". It's good that Hitchcock allowed the character to act independently, even though this appeared to be an old-fashioned marriage with the husband clearly in charge.Christopher Olsen was reasonably good as the son. Compared to many of the child actors today who seem so effective, child actors back in the 1950s often seemed less so. But he was pretty decent.I liked British actress Brenda De Banzie as one of the "bad guys". Not totally cold-hearted, so one was never sure exactly where her character might go when she was holding the son. Bernard Miles was equally good as the more evil husband. Ralph Truman was good as the inspector. I'm not sure Daniel Glin as the mysterious Louis Bernard added much to the story; seemed more like a cardboard cut-out. It was interesting to see Alan Mowbray, Hillary Brooke, and Carolyn Jones in their rather small parts. I know this is a cruel thing to say, but Reggie Nalder was too ugly not to hate as a villain; but then again, his face was how he made his living.This is a top-notch film that I think practically every Hitchcock fan enjoys. I wanted to give it an "8", but not quite...so a very strong "7". It's Stewart's film and he makes the most of us. Lucky us!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American physician James Stewart (as Benjamin "Ben" McKenna), famous singer wife Doris Day (as Josephine "Jo" Conway) and their young son Christopher Olsen (as Henry McKenna) are having a pleasant family vacation in Morocco. On a bus from Casablanca to Marrakesh, the family meet friendly Frenchman Daniel Gelin (as Louis Bernard), who helps when young "Hank" accidentally pulls off a Muslim woman's veil. Faux pas. Due to his one-sided way of gathering personal information, Ms. Day finds Mr. Gelin suspicious. While out dining, Day and Mr. Stewart meet a nice British couple Bernard Miles and Brenda de Banzie (as Edward and Lucy Drayton), who are familiar with Day's singing career...Striking up an instant friendship, the couples are shopping in a crowded marketplace when tragedy strikes...This was director Alfred Hitchcock's re-make of his own "The Man Who Knew Too Much" (1934). Mr. Hitchcock thought this film the superior work, but preferred the earlier version for its roughness. "Let's say the first version is the work of a talented amateur and the second was made by a professional," he reflected. Purists, of course, will prefer the original "Man Who Knew Too Much". The plot and basic story outline are the same, but the films are significantly different. They are both excellent, with this version boldly more skillful. Arguably, this one is more dense, and hampered by the increased running time - with extraneous shots first showing up in the introduction of the Marrakesh setting...Still, this is Hitchcock at the peak of his ability to turn out excellent feature film product. Stewart is typically fine, and his characterization falls neatly between "Rear Window" (1954) and "Vertigo" (1958). Then undervalued as a musical comedy performer, Day is at her dramatic best. In hindsight, this is a role for which Day might have been nominated as "Best Actress" of the year; she gives everything usually needed to be considered for the award, and more. "Oscar" awarded the Jay Livingston &amp; Ray Evans song "Whatever Will Be, Will Be (Que Sera, Sera)", a #1 hit for Day; it is used uncommonly well within the film's storyline. Hitchcock's famed composer Bernard Herrmann is also showcased.******** The Man Who Knew Too Much (4/30/56) Alfred Hitchcock ~ James Stewart, Doris Day, Brenda de Banzie, Bernard Miles</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Americanization of Hitchcock is complete</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time Hitchcock made the second version in 1956, two things happened to the director. One, he knew that many of the characters in the first version made in 1934 (except for Peter Lorre's riveting presence) were not good enough to be remembered. So the second version had more memorable character but none that had the presence of Lorre. Two, he lost his interest in stunning European expressionist visuals and instead concentrated on building suspense through sound of footsteps (giving the impression of being followed) and visual imagination (hand caught in a tiger's jaw in a taxidermist's workplace).Compare the two versions and it is obvious that the strong sharpshooter who can kill in version one is mellowed down to a rather domesticated singing star who has evolved into a practical housewife.Hitchcock gives more importance to food in the second version: the quip about getting rid of snails in his backyard by getting a Frenchman who loves to eat snails, the kitchen in the embassy and the brilliant Moroccan traditional restaurant scene. These provide the humor?which was more pronounced in version one?with the uncoiling of the knitting and the dentist sequence.Two sequences are copied?the assassin's gun protruding from the curtains and passing comments while singing hymns. I thought version one did the job better in these departments.However, if there was a sure winner it was the Oscar-winning song of Doris Day. Without the song and the exotic appeal of Morocco the two versions of the film pale in comparison to Hitchcock's "Notorious," "Saboteur," "Sabotage," "Foreign Correspondent," "Blackmail," "Shadow of a doubt" and "Frenzy."</fullReview>

The victim whispers something in Dr. McKenna's ear, and he is told to do something.Later, his son is kidnapped. The kidnappers turn out to be a man and woman he knew, but the woman is a bit softer than the man.The song, "Que, Sera, Sera" (Whatever we'll be, we'll be," is one of the best songs ever sung in any movie.Doris Day play's Stewart's wife, and she sings the song mentioned above.

		<fullReview>This film marks the third time that Jimmy Stewart appeared in a Hitchcock film. This time he stars alongside Doris Day.Stewart and Day are a couple on holiday in Morocco with their son Hank. Its worth noting that this kid does quite well, as some kids in old movies are really annoying. The first hour of the film is full of excellent Hitch suspense. Mysterious characters and intrigue galore. The scenery isn't bad either.After a dying man whispers something in Jimmy Stewarts ear, their son is kidnapped for their silence. You'll understand when you see the film. The twists throughout this part of the film are wonderful, superbly executed. Thumping suspense. The next segment of the movie follows the couples search for their son. The second half encompasses some light comedy elements with a rather cruel femme fatal. Although the main enemy isn't one of the best from a Hitch film.My main quibble is that the film kind of fizzles out towards the end. In my opinion the film is a little to long. Although the end is quite nice and its wrapped up in a humorous way. Worth seeing I'd say but the stars save this one. By the way I think that even Doris Day out acts Jimmy in this one. She sparkles in her role I think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot is pedestrian, but Hitchcock puts an interesting spin on it. While the McKennas are vacationing in Morocco, they learn of an assassination plot, and someone kidnaps their son.Like I said, that sounds pretty ordinary, but there's sort of an interesting role reversal. At first glance, they seem like the "average American family", with dad Ben (Jimmy Stewart) being the breadwinner. However, the mom (Doris Day) is named Jo, which almost sounds like a man's name. Moreover, the mom was once a singer, so everyone recognizes her, but not the dad.No matter, "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is one of those movies that has you tensed up from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Acting by Doris Day and James Stewart!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is well known, so I won't go into that part. The only aspect of the story that was hard to believe, was that Jo Conway would give up a successful career to marry a small town doctor and move to Indiana. All the talk about gallbladders paying for the trip, etc. disturbed me. How selfish Dr. McKenna was to allow her to give up the money and fame she obviously loved.People who don't care for Doris Day thought that she was not right for the part of "Jo McKenna." Unfortunately for her, she does look like a movie star in this part, but certainly showed the affection and concern of a mother in distress about her son's kidnapping.In my opinion, if Meryl Streep or any of today's actresses gave the identical performance as Miss Day in "Man...Much," they would be praised and nominated for an Oscar. It has always been popular to disparage Doris Day, no matter how great her performances. Helen Hunt was no better in "As Good As It Gets" than Day was in "The Thrill of It All."Day was just right in "Man...Much." As a student of acting, I watched her and Jimmy Stewart very closely and with the DVD version, it was easy to replay scenes over and over, just to study them. As a result, two magnificent acting jobs.The rest of the cast was sterling as well. Some people have criticized the way Day sang "Whatever Will...Be" at the Albert Hall. Didn't you get it? She was singing so loud so as to alert her son! Nobody really heard the lovely ballad she followed with because it was sung during the rescue of the son upstairs. The song is "We'll Love Again," and it is available on one of Day's CDs.The DVD is wonderful and has many extras, including "The Making of 'Man...Much." Day got praise for her acting from Hitchcock's daughter, who was interviewed for the documentary.In my opinion "Man...Much" is a lot better than the dull, "Vertigo" and right up there with "Rear Window" and "The Birds."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only Hitchcock would have the audacity to remake one of his own films, and with the 1956 version of The Man who knew too much (remade from the 1934 version) he attempts to give the film more heart. The original was a much darker film, shot in moody black and white with a good use of expressionistic camera angles; this version instead opts for a glossy Technicolor (more Hollywood) style. The film is interesting and has a great Jimmy Stuart performance and Doris Day's famous song, but I cant help thinking this is Hitchcock light. The Albert Hall sequence however is one of the greatest examples of Hitch as the master of suspense, with what seems like hundreds of cuts, working in complete harmony with Bernard Herman's score. Better than average, but if you're looking for Hitchcock at his best, try Rear Window...6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock didn't have to remake the original. First I'll tell you the good things about this remake. 1: Ending where the family reunites is great. 2:Bernard Herrmann appears as himself. 3: The addition of "Que Sera" is a superb idea. 4: The father is wiser in this version than the original one. Then come the bad things. 1: Forgive me if I'm mistaken but London would have people walking through the streets in the day time.2: The Albert Hall seems to keep going on and on which drains the suspense the original movie's sequence had.3: Changing the child to a boy in this version totally ruined it. The boy is annoying but the girl and parents of the original can cruelly tease eachother without being serious and rude and it's funny. The family in this take it serious at one another and there is no humor.4: The black develish humor of Peter Lorre as Abbott is great and seems to be in the highest rank of all the villians.But the one in this version is dull and nervously takes orders from another person we see much later in the film.Down to the bottom line, both good, see them both, but you'll like the original better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Suspense and an Oscar Winning Song</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1956, Doris Day joined the list of blonds that director, Alfred Hitchcock seemed to prefer as leading ladies. The vehicle was, of course, "The Man Who Knew Too Much" co-starring that Hitchcock favorite, James Stewart.The story was rather simple, a vacationing family becomes entangled in an international assassination plot, and to keep their mouths shut, their son is kidnapped by the "bad guys."James Stewart had played this part in many movies before and was very effective. Doris Day, playing a former singing star, was quite wonderful as his wife.The plot took them from Morocco to England's Albert Hall where Miss Day sings "Whatever Will Be, Will Be", a child's song, to alert her kidnapped son whom she suspects is being held captive upstairs. She sings "We'll Love Again" but it's hard to concentrate on the song because of the son's rescue by Stewart.The film utilized Hitchcock's typical camera work and had a good score which punctuated the excitement. This was no fashion show for Doris Day wore only three different outfits, designed for her by Edith Head.The song, "Whatever Will Be, Will Be" won the Oscar as Best Song of 1956, but received no other nominations. This film was a big winner at the box office and joined the list of Hitchock classics, including "Psycho," "Rear Window," and "The Birds."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slap-sticky second half ruins it .....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great first half where Hitchcock shows his risqu, provocative and suspenseful side is ruined by a crass second half where Hitch tries too hard to entertain and evoke laughter.The film begins quite provocatively where a kid pulls off the veil of a Muslim lady in Morroco ("the Muslim religion allows for few accidents" :)). In the post-colonial world, irritations that emanate out of the meeting of different cultures is expressed subtly but markedly. In HELP! (1965), Ringo Starr says "Get sacrificed! I don't subscribe to your religion!" to a Hindu character. Cinema has become quite tame since those days.Doris Day's middle aged character gazes almost longingly at the suspicious DANIEL GELIN who befriends the aging couple in the bus after he saves them from the religious Muslim. The stage is set for a sexy thriller.But it all falls apart after the couple reaches London to search for their son. There are no real twists in the second half and instead there is the needless slap sticky fight scene with the taxidermist and his assistants. The film should have ended at the concert but instead we have a very unremarkable finale.DORIS DAY is quite motherly unlike the usually sexy and mesmerizing Hitchcock heroines. Overall, this film was a huge disappointment after the promising first half.(6/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this Hitchcock suspense/thriller, an unsuspecting American family (Jimmy Stewart, Doris Day and their young son) get caught up in political intrigue while vacationing in Morroco after they befriend a mysterious Frenchman. But the Frenchman gets stabbed because he knew too much (an assassination plot which is going to take place in London), and as he lies dying on a street full of onlookers, he confides to Jimmy about the plot. However, in order to keep Jimmy quiet, the conspirators kidnap his son. Since Jimmy and Doris can't go to the police and they can't just allow the assassination to take place, they take matters into their own hands...When this flick was made, Jimmy and Doris were at the zenith of their careers, and they both deliver exceptional performances, especially for Doris where we get a rare chance to see her showcase her talent as a dramatic actress. They have great chemistry together as an "old married couple" which is something that the Doris character vehemently denies in the picture.The portrayal of their relationship is something that should not be overlooked. Doris is a former singing star who sacrificed fame and career so that she could be a housewife to Jimmy, who is a doctor practicing in the Midwest. However, she seems to harbor some resentment for having made this decision, and you can see from her constant ridiculing and scolding that she believes that she is his superior. Their relationship seems to be crumbling and in one very emotional scene from Doris, it does not appear that the marriage will survive. However, the kidnapping ultimately provides them the opportunity to bond as they work together to try to get their son back.This is one of the most interesting, suspenseful and enjoyable of all Hitchcock films, but because it was a remake, it did not receive all of the acclaim it deserves. This movie has everything, including comedic elements and great music (Que Sera Sera and a score from Bernard Herrmann) that is worked into the storyline. This is a must see that will keep you on the edge of your seat.</fullReview>

Once there they become caught up in a web of spies and Dr McKenna hears talk of the assassination in London of an important politician. Things turn worse when Hank is kidnapped and Mckenna and Jo race against time and threats on their lives to get him back. It all comes to a close with the crash of the cymbals at the Royal Albert Hall. This 1956 film is a remake of Hitchcock's earlier film The Man Who Knew Too Much(1934). Both versions are quite good and in this James Stewart is excellent as a man who's life is altered drastically.Doris Day is wonderful as his worried wife and she and Stewart have good chemistry.

		<shortDescription>Good suspense, but not first-rate Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Man Who Knew Too Much" does a good job with its drama, but somehow it lacked a draw in human warmth that it should have had, or at least interesting characters.I did not sense a real attraction between James Stewart and Doris Day, and their son seemed more annoying than he ought to have been. While that can work, none of the main characters seemed all that intriguing on his own, and none of the supporting characters had much color either.The early Morocco scenes conveyed a good air of creepiness right from the start -- that something was not quite right on the family vacation. But where the McKennas ought to have been laying the groundwork of their relationship, establishing sympathy to the viewer, I just found them stilted and uncomfortable without much charm at all.The later scenes in London lost much of the lingering menace, until two climactic scenes in the last half hour. By this time, the family relationship of the McKennas was pivotal to evoke sympathy for their circumstances, and the lack of depth there took away much of the impact of the scenes.The film also lacked the humor that is common in most Hitchcock films, with extremely few laugh lines or situations.On the whole, it is a decently done suspense film, and it does entertain, but it is not one of Hitchcock's greats.</fullReview>

And that is just what the master of suspense did in 1956. In fact this version feels more like an extended, director's cut than a remake. The story is essentially the same. Ben (James Stewart) and Jo MacKenna(Doris Day)are vacationing in French Morocco with their son (Christopher Olson). They are quickly caught up in international intrigue and must try to stop an unknown diplomats assassination and keep their son from being harmed.While the original stays mainly indoors keeping its action to a few set pieces. In this new version Hitchcock thrills in taking his characters, and the audience, to wild, colorful places around the world. It begins in Northern Africa and here we see many lovely shots of the country side. The action moves to London where there numerous shots inside enormous, gorgeous buildings like the Royal Albert Hall.The opening credit sequence is beautifully done. Hitchock shoots a half orchestra playing the opening music. It takes a few moments to realize that the typical orchestrated number you are hearing over the credits is visibly being played by real people on the picture. This inventive bit is promptly ruined by an uninteresting title card played over the cymbalist.I own the original 1934 version and recently watched it. There are many debates raging over the internet on which version is superior. Frankly, I find both version to be lacking. The original was paced quicker but suffered from several jolts in plot which created some confusion and no sympathy for the protagonists. The newer version tries to help this out by giving us over long and unmoving scenes in which the protagonists try to stretch out their characters. Jimmy Stewart does a marvelous job as usual, but Dorris Day is annoying in nearly every scene. She is pretty and plays the part of a normal, cheerful American girl, but she grits my teeth while she's on the screen. Maybe I'm just not a fan. In a scene towards the end she sings "Que Sera Sera" and to my ears it sounds like she's howling the number. One could argue that she is singing loudly for a plot purpose, but I would say it would serve the movie better if it was pretty and not harsh. In an interesting bit of trivia Ms. Day apparently didn't like the song to the point of nearly refusing to record it. It turned out to be her biggest hit, and won the Oscar that year.There is an ingenious bit of film making in the latter 3/4ths of the movie filmed in the Royal Albert Hall. There is some 12 minutes when not a word of dialogue is spoken and the only sound heard is the music played by the orchestra. It is a beautifully crafted scene that builds tension like a bullet.There are several plot elements that make me ill at ease. The Scotland Yard seems terribly inept. We are made to believe that these detectives are willing to allow the MacKenna's to run around the streets of London trying to solve the crime by themselves even though Mr. MacKenna knows important details about the assassination of an important diplomat. Why would an assassin use a small pistol to kill the diplomat from a long distance? After the assassination attempt why is everyone allowed to run free? There are other questions and ineptitude that go unanswered except to allow a movie to tie up loose ends quickly and move the plot along.Hitchcock was a master at manipulating audiences. He is in fine form throughout this movie quickly moving the viewer through the scenery with a good bit of humor and suspense. This is not a bad movie by any stretch. There is a great deal to enjoy as a carefree audience member and for anyone interested in the craft and art of film. However, it is far from Hitchcock's greatest film, and I find its flaws to be more disappointing considering the masterful hands that created it.More reviews at www.midnitcafe.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i must say that the strength of the film is lost in the new version. i prefer the 34 version for several reasons, most of them concerning doris day. her character is too prim, too wussy, too....too doris day. don't get me wrong, i dig that touch of mink and pillow talk, but hitchcock thrillers is not her forte. jill lawrence is in no way believable. there's not underlying anger to spurn her on. jimmy stewart (a hitchcock staple) is good as bill lawrence, but i think leslie banks did a less "bumbling" job. he, also, was more believable in his character than the 56 cast. also, the datedness of the characters in prevalent here. the fifties "yes, dear" attitude of the feminine charecters is nauseating. i prefer the "tough-brawds" of the 30's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>overrated and dated and please no more Que Sera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big fan of Jimmy Stewart, I was prepared for a great movie but was sorely disappointed. Mr. Stewart's superb acting is all that holds this flimsy work together. Doris Day is terribly miscast and I wonder if she was put into the film just so she could sing Que Sera repeatedly. No assassin would use a pistol to fire at someone thirty yards away and no assassin would keep to his mission once he knew he had been discovered. I'm also curious as to how the British authorities knew, upon the arrival of Dr. and Mrs Ben to London, of the kidnapping of Dr. Ben's son, considering that the good doctor and his wife decided to keep it a secret. This film also is too dated. There are too many scenes of them in a car or a wagon with a screen behind them. Screens are used as backdrops in some scenes, even though some of the movie was filmed in Marrakesh. I do not understand why film on location, then use a screen, unless this would be necessary for sound quality. All in all, a disappointing film and a very so so conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sluggish, but still underrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, a warning: don't look for "substance" and "meaning" here: even though it's a Hitchcock picture, it's decidedly insubstantial, just like "To Catch A Thief" or "Torn Curtain". Hitchcock's only aim in those films is to entertain his audience. And "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is nearly perfect entertainment. There are some outstanding, imaginative scenes; my favorite is an often forgotten one, in which Stewart and Day try to pass unnoticed in a church, so they sing to each other instead of talking. An absorbing film, even though it's slightly too long and sluggish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(Warning: Spoiler) - Nonexistent Chemistry Between Day and Stewart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I agree that Hitchcock is definitely a master of the genre of suspense, I had a lot of trouble with this particular remake. I'm a fan of Jimmy Stewart films, but this is probably the only movie I've seen where I just couldn't identify with his character. He seemed out of place somehow and constantly irritable. Of course, that would be somewhat understandable considering that he was supposed to be in a constant state of distress due to his son being kidnapped. But even before the kidnapping, he came off as being the uncomfortable, ugly American in a foreign country who doesn't understand and mocks the local customs. Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day seem to have no chemistry together whatsoever. They truly look like a mismatched pair and when Day mentions to Stewart that she'd like to have another baby, he looked as if the idea was as appalling and startling as if he was being propositioned by a stranger - which is exactly how it looked on film.I didn't see much tenderness or any of the boyish smiles that Stewart usually delivers to his leading ladies (e.g. Rear Window). Day seemed like the overly prim and proper (and lets not forget nagging) wife. She even primps her hair after they disembark from the carriage ride after they had witnessed a murder. The scene where Stewart drugs Day before he tells her that their child had been kidnapped was harrowing. It was like watching some horrible slow-motion detail of a dysfunctional family. There was the remark "Are we having our monthly argument?" that Day delivers flatly, without emotion. Then Stewart starts badgering Day to take some mysterious white pills, without telling her what they are. Day is saying how Stewart complained that she took too many pills in objection. (Drug abuse?) Stewart starts taking issue with her about her behavior and insists that she needs to take these pills and then holds her down on the bed after he gives her the bad news about their kid - and all delivered with about as much compassion as one might tell someone about an item they read in the newspaper. Then he quietly packs and goes about his business while his wife is completely zoned out from the sedatives he forced on her. Yeah...nice family.Granted, this is from another era where the dynamics between men and women were very different than they are today. But I still found the dialog between Stewart and Day and the lack of warmth between them disturbing.I have to admit though that I'm not a particular Doris Day fan and I didn't enjoy her presence on screen, or even her singing much. I'm sure that Day fans would see me as a philistine for saying so. But I'm just aware that my having a negative reaction to the film may have been due in part to the fact that I'm not very fond of Doris Day. I still think that this film could have been far better casted, replacing both Day and Stewart who don't really seem to fit these roles very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock remakes his 1934 thriller. A mild mannered doctor takes his family on a European vacation and makes a swing through Casablanca and Morocco. There the doctor and his wife are caught up in an international assassination attempt as well as trying to recover their own son from kidnappers.One of Hitch's favorite's, James Stewart, plays Dr. McKenna and Doris Day plays Mrs. McKenna. Mr. Stewart has had better roles. Interesting story, but not one of my favorite Hitchcock films. Both stars were not hard pressed to deal with the script they were given. Suspense comes to an abrupt halt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You know how much a remake of this would suck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Half Hitchcock suspense thriller and half travelogue starring Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day, The Man Who Knew Too Much is a great example of how the master director cared as much about character as visual imagery or ratcheting up the audience's anxiety. He spends an extraordinarily long time with Dr. Ben McKenna (Jimmy Stewart), his former stage star wife Jo (Doris Day) and their son Hank (Christopher Olsen) on a seeming normal vacation to North African before finally setting in motion the international assassination plot at the heart of the story. No one now would even think about giving the McKenna's multiple scenes of ordinary family life. There'd be a sketchy introduction and then bang! Right into the killing and kidnapping and what have you. Hitchcock, though, wants the drama to flow from and through his cast, if you know what I mean.Of course, it makes it easier to delay the suspense when you've got Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day to engage the viewer. I could watch Day recite the value of pi to the ten thousandth decimal point. But Hitchcock understood that the way the McKenna's react to peril is far more compelling if you first see how they naturally behave in placid times. Ben McKenna starts out as a laid back and somewhat dull witted fellow who becomes consumed with desperate determination as the kidnapping of his son. Jo is a very smart and self-possessed woman who has it all stripped away from her at the loss of Hank, only to find a new core of strength within her.It has become a little hard to swallow the authorities so blithely standing by and allowing the McKenna's conceal information about an international murder plot, but that's 9/11 for you. Christopher Olsen is also a typically horrid 1950s child actor. And Hitchcock's constant use of rear projection for the background of scenes, especially when two or more people are in a motor vehicle, has got to look garish to generations raised on superior filmmaking techniques.All of that is decisively outweighed by genius moments, like when Jo is witness to the impending assassination but is crushed under the weight that trying to stop it might cost her son's life, or how Hitchcock shows the growing concern for the boy by one of his captors (Brenda de Banzie).The Man Who Knew Too Much is a very good motion picture and easily fits it with the more landmark works of its director. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A family vacationing in Morocco accidentally stumble on to an assassination plot and the conspirators are determined to prevent them from interfering.Leave it to Hitchcock to return to one of his earlier films and bring it back in style. While it is hard to top Peter Lorre as a great character actor, throwing James Stewart into this mix made for instant success. (Stewart was always great, but Hitchcock brought out some of his best performances.) Doris Day impressed me less. I understand this film sparked her career hit "Que Sera, Sera", but neither her acting nor her singing was terribly impressive to me. But she was not bad, either, so I guess it could be worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the 40s and 50s, Alfred Hitchcock and James Stewart made wonderful films together; this is one of them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock and James Stewart made some unforgettable thrillers together. Their last collaboration was on a film called Vertigo. It's considered a masterpiece today, but Vertigo was released to no critical acclaim or financial success originally. That created a rift between Hitchcock and Stewart as Hitchcock believed Stewart was too old to attract audiences. Stewart wanted to star in Hitchcock's North by Northwest but he didn't get the part because of how old Hitchcock thought he appeared. Hitchcock and Stewart never made another film together. That's what makes these precious few films so precious. The Man Who Knew Too Much is exceptionally special for those facts and many more, too. This really is a great film.Stewart plays Ben McKenna in the movie. He's a doctor from Indianapolis, Indiana. Dr. McKenna is traveling to Morocco with his wife, Jo, and his little boy, Hank. They attended a convention for Dr. McKenna's profession in Paris and have done some hopping around since as tourists. We're introduced to the mystery, the real meat of the movie early as the doctor and his family meet the mysterious Louis Bernard in the first scene. International intrigue, an assassination plot and kidnapping ensue.Stewart is one of the greatest screen actors of all-time, he played the everyman better than just about every man. That's what attracted Hitchcock to Stewart so much; he was such a humble, unassuming human being. Those qualities of Stewart's shine through in his movies. Doris Day plays Dr. McKenna's wife. You'd be hard-pressed to find a more beautiful leading lady than Day. She was a wonderful singer, too, as we all know. Day performs Que Sera, Sera (an original song for this film) and delivers the most spectacular version of it toward the end of the film when the tension is at its highest. The song almost becomes a character in the film itself.The real doctor here is Hitchcock himself as he expertly, almost surgically executes this movie. The opera scene in this movie is one of the most tense ever put to film; just another day at the office for Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too long and convoluted but still worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock remake of his 1934 film. All American couple Jo and Ben McKenna (Doris Day, Jimmy Stewart) and son Hank (Christopher Olsen) are visiting Morocco. They witness a killing and the victim whispers to Stewart about an assassination attempt that's going to happen. Hank is kidnapped to keep Jo and Ben from telling the police. But can they just stand by and let a man be killed? The original was great--fast-paced and well acted and only 85 minutes. This remake rambles on for 120 minutes! The opening hour in Morocco especially drags. Conversations go on endlessly and the same information is repeated again and again. Then it moves to London for the last hour. Things do pick up a little and it has a few truly incredible sequences (the Albert Hall assassination attempt and the ending) but, again, it drags and gets pretty confusing. There's a whole visit to a taxidermists shop that has nothing to do with anything. Also plot holes abound--how did Stewart know Day went to Albert Hall? Still it's well-directed (of course) in beautiful color. All the acting is great--even Day in a rare dramatic role. Also, as far as I know, this is the only Hitchcock film to win an Oscar for Best Song--Day sings "Que Sera Sera" multiple times. That may be a plus or minus to individual viewers.Hitchcock later on did say (sort of) that he preferred this remake to the original. He was the original was made by a "talented amateur" but the remake was done by a "professional". Hate to disagree with him but this one would have worked much better if it had been cut down and made less confusing. I give it a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't make a move or the kid gets it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ostensibly a story about the young child of Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day. The kid gets kidnapped to keep his parents quiet. They know something about a plot to assassinate the ambassador of an unnamed country during a performance at Albert Hall in London.The movie is rich in Hitchcockian incidents. A friendly but opaque Frenchman seems to grill the innocent Stewart -- a doctor from Indiana -- a little too intensely to be merely idly curious. Later the Frenchman shows up in Arab disguise, a knife in his back, and whispers some information about the murder plot to Stewart. Stewart tells his wife -- Doris Day looking very saucy indeed -- but refuses to cooperate with the police and risk his son's life.Instead the couple try to track down the assassins, buy them off, and get their son back, taking them from Morocco, where Hitchcock has given us his usual tourist's eye view of the customs, locations, and food, to London. There is a hilarious wild goose chase involving a set-to between Stewart and the staff of a taxidermy shop. The staff are more concerned about guarding their half-stuffed specimens than anything else, and they shuffle around protectively holding the carcasses of a leopard and a swordfish. In the course of the scuffle, Stewart manages to save his throat from being cut by the swordfish bill, but is bitten on the hand by a stuffed tiger, the action boosted along by Bernard Hermann's bumptious score. The scene ends with Stewart rushing out the door. Hitchcock ends it with a shot of a lion's head gaping at the slammed door. There is also a running gag, well done, about some visitors waiting around the couple's hotel room in London, waiting for things to be explained.There are two serious issues that are lightly touched on. One is the relationship between Stewart and Day, which is not as rosy as it ought to be, considered as a bourgeois ideal. She's been a stage musical star for some years and is internationally known. And she's given it all up to marry an ordinary guy who happens to be a doc. That's understandable in, say, a nurse or a flight attendant or almost any woman other than an international star with a promising career in her own right. It isn't delved into, but the edginess is noticeable, as it was not in the original version. It reminds me a little of an exchange between Joe Dimaggio and his then-wife Marilyn Monroe, who had just returned from entertaining the troops in Korea. "Oh, Joe," she gushed, "did you ever see ten thousand people stand up and cheer?" "Seventy thousand," muttered Joe, former hero of the New York Yankees.The second problem is one of allegiance. Who is of greater social value? One's own young son? Or an unknown ambassador. Do we put ourselves or our loved ones at risk for the sake of national stability? Day is faced with this dilemma in its starkest form at the climax in the Albert Hall. Her solution opts for allegiance to political stability, although her motives are problematic. Does she scream to save the ambassador's life, or does she do so just to release the anxiety that is overwhelming her? (Cf: Alec Guiness falling on the detonator at the end of "The Bridge on the River Kwai.") The photography is extremely good, and the settings can be menacing, even on a quiet street in a residential neighborhood of London. It's mid-day, and Stewart is alone and determined, but frightened too. There are footsteps echoing on Gulliver Street from someone, somewhere. Is he being followed? Is his life in danger? And where the hell is everybody who lives on this street? Hitchcock pays such close attention to location details that we can make out the garden wall bonding of the bricks beside him.The director had a rare disagreement with Francois Truffaut while being interviewed for Truffaut's otherwise laudatory book. Truffaut argued that the earlier version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" lacked the depth of the later version. Hitchcock replied, "It seems to me you want me to make films for the art house audience," but finally agreed that the 1930s version was the work of a talented amateur and this version was the work of a professional. No argument there.This is Hitchcock pretty much near his zenith.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doris Day almost ruins it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not my favorite Hitchcock, but still very entertaining with some enjoyable moments of pathos. On a recent viewing, I realized that this film's unfortunate weakness is the performance of Doris Day, especially in the early part of the movie. She just isn't on par with the rest of the excellent cast. Her makeup in the early scenes is pretty awful, too.The film also has more plot holes than the average Hitchcock thriller (he wasn't generally known for being concerned with seamless stories, in any event, but this one has some whoppers). For example, we aren't treated with a cutaway to explain how Stewart ends up at Albert Hall, nor why he chose the belfry over some other means of escape from the church. Rien's use of a semi-automatic pistol instead of a rifle seems rather ludicrous to anybody who knows the first thing about firearms. Also, why does Rien drop by the McKenna's hotel room, and how does Scotland Yard already know about Hank when the McKenna's land in London? These lapses are convenient for the story, but they bother you afterward.Two sequences from the movie stand out as classic Hitchcock. One is Stewart's errant visit to the taxidermist's. Nice combination of suspense and comedy. The other is the Albert Hall concert from Stewart's arrival to the end. It plays out like a silent movie, where you see, but cannot hear, people talking, yet you know pretty much exactly what they are saying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Doris Day had already proved herself as a fine dramatic actress the year before this film in the great "Love Me or Leave Me." This time she does it again along with James Stewart in Alfred Hitchcock's "The Man Who Knew Too Much."In typical Hitchcock style, a vacationing couple in Morocco accidentally stumble on an assassination plot. The plotters want to make sure that nothing will stop them. Therefore, they kidnap the Stewart child. Remember the scene when Doris realizes that her son has been hidden in the embassy where she and Stewart have gone? Que Sera Sera was the surprise Oscar winner for best song of the year. The conventional wisdom was that For Thee I Know from "Friendly Persuasion" would win the award. However, with Doris singing the former, with fear in her heart for her son's safety, how could it lose? Great picture. The excitement and tension never let up. That's what great movie making is all about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Am I the only person who believes this American version is far better than the 1934 English film? The English version has no suspense, looks antique and very low budget, and has unexceptional acting (except for Peter Lorre). The 1956 version, besides having top production values, shows James Stewart as the perfect 'innocent' American abroad, and gives Doris Day her best role ever. Of particular note is the music - the music of the American film is almost classic; compare the "Albert Hall' sequences of both, and you will agree that the Bernard Herrmann music is far more exciting than the original version (even though it's basically the same music!). The only flaw in the 1956 film is the ridiculous encounter in the taxidermy shop. I would appreciate any argument that can prove to me that the English version is better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man Who Knew Too Much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Sir Alfred Hitchcock, this is one of the only cases I can think of where a film director remakes his own film, and in this case improves it. Basically Dr. Ben McKenna (James Stewart) is on vacation in Marakesh, Morocco with his singer wife Jo (Doris Day) and their son Henry 'Hank' McKenna (Christopher Olsen), and on a bus they meet the mysterious Louis Bernard (Daniel Glin). The next day Bernard is murdered in the street, giving Ben some details of an assassination that will take place in London, England. Fearing their plot will be revealed, the assassins kidnap Hank to make sure Ben and Jo stay silent, so they go to London themselves to take matters into their own hands. Ben goes to find the place where his son may be being held, and Jo helps him when she realises it is an address, not a name, and of course they end up finding out the plot. They know that the villains are planning to assassinate the Ambassador (Mogens Wieth) at a concert in the Royal Albert Hall. After saving his life, the Ambassador invites Ben and Jo to his residence, and eventually they realise that Hank is being held there, and everything is settled in the end. Also starring Bernard Miles as Edward Drayton, Brenda De Banzie as Lucy Drayton, Ralph Truman as Inspector Buchanan, Reggie Nalder as the assassin Rien, Alan Mowbray as Val Parnell, Hillary Brooke as Jan Peterson, and Hitchcock's cameo is a man watching acrobats in the Moroccan marketplace. Stewart is fantastic, Day adds charm, and the Oscar winning number one song, number 48 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, "Whatever Will Be, Will Be (Que Sera, Sera)" is great, one you shouldn't miss. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Doris Day was number 84, James Stewart number 12 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Stewart was also number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 13 on The World's Greatest Actor.

		<fullReview>This is Hitchcock light! and that it usually much much better than most! Some back-projection is very awful. Apparently filming in Morocco at the time was very dangerous at the time (If you have the DVD you will understand). James Stewart was a very good choice for many Hitchcocks, he was both drama and comedy, The scene with the stuffed animals is a riot, apparently all amateurs in acting, And Doris Day! I think this is one of her best! She actually was good in thrillers ( look also at Midnight Lace) but made them too seldom. Without telling spoilers, Foul Play with Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase must have got their climax ideas from this.Brenda de Banzie and Lord Bernard Miles as the English couple, is just the right amount of menace and faked kindness. Daniel Gelin apparently was a teen idol in France once (Not sure myself). All in All this is Hitchcock when he was he was in his lightest moods! Don't miss the Morroccan restaurant scene, and James Stewart trying to place his legs! Hitchcock have of course made better and more complex movies, but this seems to be him, doing something light, something for a broader audience. But maybe not his most nailbiting film, this is fun and light!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Enjoyable Hitchcock Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Less a thriller than an colorful adventure with suspenseful elements, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH should not be really be compared with such Hitchcock masterpieces as VERTIGO, REAR WINDOW, or PSYCHO; it is instead more akin to such enjoyable romps as TO CATCH A THIEF and NORTH BY NORTHWEST. Shot largely on location in Morocco and London, the film tells the story of a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) whose holiday is interrupted when they innocently run afoul of an assassination plot--and when their young son is kidnapped in order to insure their silence.James Stewart and Doris Day are quite effective in their roles of the All-American couple, and the characters are given an unusual twist: Stewart, a midwestern doctor, is outgoing but has a touch of "the ugly American abroad" about his personality; Day, who plays a popular stage and recording star who retired upon her marriage, has a suspicious nature. These qualities of personality and background play extremely well into the story.THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH contains a number of famous scenes; both the scene in which Stewart drugs Day before telling her of the kidnapping and the very complex Albert Hall sequence, involving what seems hundreds of cuts, are very powerful. Less often noticed, although to my mind equally if not more satisfactory, are the more subtle scenes in which Hitchcock combines an edge of suspense along with perverse humor, as when Stewart attempts some detecting at a taxidermist shop and Day belts out "Que Sera, Sera" (written for this film) in a most unsuitable way at an embassy cocktail party.Although THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH lacks the depth and impact of Hitchcock's greater work, it remains an enjoyable film and one that compares very well with his work as a whole. It's Hitchcock-light, but recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only 7.4?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe this movie only scores 7.4! This surely ranks up with the best of Hitchcock's movies such as VERTIGO or MARNIE. The only reason I can think of why the score is so low, is that for the most part, THE MAN... renounces violence and certainly won't get a diploma in "sex and crime".What it derives its tension from is not violence, it's the reckless energy of these criminals that take a child from his parents and are ready to kill the kid if the operation fails. Today, having seen a lot of hardboiled kidnapping movies as Mel Gibson's RANSOM, this seems normal, but in the 1950s, where family was all in contemporary America, the thought of such a crime surely has stirred up emotions a lot.And this tension still works for me, today. Yeah, these guys are selfish, ignorant bastards, disturbing in how they act: It's a deal for them, and they want to be "good businessmen", disregarding the fact that business here is kidnapping kids and assassinating politicians in the opera!! What makes the movie great, however, are the creative aspects, the kinky ideas of Hitchcock, the outrageously disturbing scene in the church (which brings it to the viewer's attention how alone, how abandoned the protagonists are, nobody caring, nobody helping, the people in the church just going home...), the meeting with the owner of that shop stuffing and preparing dead animals (which stresses the somewhat "oriental" flair the movie has from the opening scenes abroad), last not least the role of MUSIC in this movie.Music is the key principle here, as ***SPOILER*** the assassination of the targeted politician is to be done exactly in the moment of a loud orchastra tutti/gong; so Hitchcock lets the camera follow the orchestra score and you now it will happen in a second ***BANG*** And then, of course, DORIS DAY singing Que sera, which became more famous than the movie itself; she sings it to notify the kid of his parents being in the embassy...All in all: A classic!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock remakes his own 1934 film, making it much longer and bringing in stars James Stewart and Doris Day as the distraught parents drawn into an international murder plot. This is another effective mystery from Hitchcock featuring a few exciting and tense scenes, and some good twists.Dr. Mckenna, his wife and young son are on holiday in Morocco. When their son Hank accidentally strips a woman of her veil on a bus, Louis Bernard intervenes, easing the situation. Later he decides to meet them for dinner and agrees to show them around. However, he acts suspiciously and Jo Mckenna believes he may be a spy or worse as he asks them questions in a clever fashion, never revealing anything about himself. When he is called away on business, declining to have dinner with them, the Doc and his wife go out with another old English couple. They see Bernard at the same restaurant and now the doc becomes suspicious. However, the next day Bernard, disguised as an Arab is murdered, but before he expires he tells Ben Mckenna of an assassination plot which he must not reveal to anyone else. While Mckenna is being questioned by the Police, their new friends the Drayton's look after Hank. When the Police have finished the Mckennas return to the Hotel to find the Draytons have kidnapped Hank. Without police help, and only their own wits and Bernard's words they set out to save their son, and stop an assassination.Hitchcock is in full control here, pulling the viewer whichever way he wants, and James Stewart is as good as ever. Day on the other hand seems out of place, only there to sing a song which may save their son, a song which won an Oscar, but is just plain annoying. The rest of the cast are good, but hardly shine. The scenes at the Royal Albert Hall are full of suspense, and the preceding scenes as the couple catch up on the Draytons are well constructed. Also, Hitchcock manages to fit plenty of humour in, looking at married life and the arguments which can arise, and the confusion of friends looking in from the outside. Overall an enjoyable film which has plenty of good ideas and moments, but which lacks the finer touches which made some of his other films masterpieces.7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1956's The Man Who Knew Too Much is exceptional entertainment. To those who prefer the 1934 original, I will say that that one is faster paced and wittier. However, even though the American version was (heaven forbid!) a big budget blockbuster, I believe it blows the British version out of the water. I think this is one of Hitchcock's 10 best-no small feat considering he made over 50 films and many of them were among the greatest of all time. I find so many things to love:1)James Stewart, America's favorite everyman for so many years, does an excellent job playing the distressed father here. He can make any film enjoyable, and working with such a likeable character in such a gripping story, he had me rooting for him very intensely. Leslie Banks in the original is nothing in comparison.2)Doris Day. Yes Doris Day. Despite all the criticisms directed toward her, I think she makes the loving wife/mother an extremely sympathetic person. I disagree with the negative remarks towards her character; just because she is soft-spoken and gentle it doesn't mean she is docile and helpless. I don't want to spoil anything, but she does make a crucial discovery by herself after her husband has failed. She gives the story a level of warmth that just wasn't there in the first one, and for those who care about that this version is the way to go. And I loved Que Sera Sera; I think it is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard and deservedly won its Oscar. It elevated the film to another level.3)The Albert Hall sequence. I don't think it was too long at all; I think the suspense built the whole time to that terrific crescendo and Hitchcock's direction in this scene was absolutely brilliant. And the assassin was truly frightening. 4)The ending really put a smile on my face; even after the aforementioned scene was over I found the rescue scene to be exciting and it was great to see the charming family together again. The last line in the film is highly amusing. I don't think the film started out slowly; Hithcock was trying to get us to know and like the McKennas and he did a great job. I wasn't a huge fan of the kid playing Hank, but I didn't have a problem with him. Since Hank was Ben and Jo's kid I cared about him too; it's not like he was a brat or anything. I found no major flaws in this movie and so many major and minor virtues. Way to go Hitch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mystery in Marrakesh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Stewart and Doris Day are a family on vacation in Morocco where they encounter a mysterious Frenchman in a bus, an English couple in their hotel, a stabbing in the Square in Marrakesh and their son being kidnapped.They find themselves in an assassination plot as events shift to London and ultimately to a finale at the Albert Hall and then an embassy of an unnamed country.This colour version of a film is a remake of Hitchcock's earlier work and was shot on location in Morocco and London but the constant filmed backdrops is off putting. At first I thought the film was shot in a Hollywood back-lot but it really is Marrakesh.The film takes time to get going as we have scenes establishing Muslim culture in Marrakesh such as how to eat local cuisine before the mystery starts to unravel.Both Stewart and Day are convincing as the anguished couple especially Stewart who quickly works out what happened to them in Morocco and the couple decide to investigate with the clues they have in search for their son.Maybe the mystery that leads to them finding their son and even taking them to the assassination is rather easily done when they seem to be getting no help from the police and rather punctures the tension.Bernard Herrmann appears as himself in the Albert Hall sequence where the assassination attempt is linked to a concert but the film just does not hang together so well. Like the constant mixing of location filming and backdrop footage the film comes across jarring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes a talented amateur can beat the professional at his own game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A number of Alfred Hitchcock's films have been remade- "The 39 Steps", "The Lady Vanishes", "Psycho"- but "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is the only example of Hitchcock remaking one of his own films. The original "Man Who Knew Too Much" was made in 1934 during Hitchcock's British period; the remake dates from 1956 when the director apparently needed to make one more film to fulfill a contractual obligation to Paramount Pictures. The plot differs somewhat from that of the 1934 film; in particular it omits the final shootout which drew upon Hitchcock's own youthful memories of the Sidney Street siege. Although the film was produced by a big Hollywood studio and the married couple at the centre of the action (British in the original) here become American, none of the action actually takes place in the USA. The opening scenes were shot in Marrakesh (replacing Switzerland in the 1934 film) and the bulk of the film preserves the original's London setting. Ben McKenna, a doctor from Indiana, his wife Jo and their son Hank are on holiday in Morocco (at this time still a French colony) when they witness the murder of an acquaintance named Louis Bernard, who turns out to be a French secret agent. After being stabbed in the back, Bernard dies in Ben's arms, but not before has had time to whisper to Ben that a foreign Prime Minister will be assassinated in London very soon. Before he can inform the police Ben receives a mysterious phone call telling him that his son has been kidnapped. The kidnappers' price for the boy's safe release is the McKennas' silence about Bernard's last words until after the assassination has taken place. This sets up a similar scenario to that in the earlier film; the parents of the kidnapped child (a boy here, a girl in the original) have to rely upon their own resources, both to secure the release of their child and to prevent the assassination, without notifying the authorities. As in the 1934 film we never learn the nationality of the threatened politician (a wholly fictitious country, to judge from the national flag we see) or what the assassins hope to gain by his death. As in the original the assassination attempt is scheduled to take place during a concert at the Albert Hall (in keeping with Hitchcock's fondness for setting key scenes in or on landmark buildings or structures), and the work being played is again Arthur Benjamin's "Storm Clouds Cantata", specially composed for the 1934 film. In an article about "Hitchcock's Blondes" the critic Camille Paglia pointed out that, even in his lighter productions, the great man preferred actresses like Ingrid Bergman, Grace Kelly, or Eva Marie Saint who were best known for their serious work; he did not generally make use of what Paglia called "comedy blondes" like Marilyn Monroe or Jayne Mansfield. "The Man Who Knew Too Much", however, is an exception. Although Doris Day's looks certainly qualified her as a "Hitchcock blonde" she was chiefly known for her work in comedies and musicals. It was, however, Hitchcock himself who insisted on using her here, against the wishes of the producers. He may have been attracted by her voice; Jo is supposed to be a professional singer, and the song "Que Sera Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)", written for the film, plays an important part in the film's denouement. (It was to become Day's most famous hit). In an interview with Franois Truffaut, Hitchcock said of the two versions of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" "Let's say the first version is the work of a talented amateur and the second was made by a professional." If he meant by that that the 1956 film was the superior one, I am afraid that I cannot agree. The 1934 version is not Hitchcock's greatest film of his British period when compared with something like "The 39 Steps" or "The Lady Vanishes", but it has strengths which its successor lacks. Certainly, Day and James Stewart as Ben are more charismatic than Leslie Banks and Edna Best who played the equivalent roles in 1934. The later film, however, lacks a villain who can compare with Peter Lorre's Abbott, by far the most memorable villain of the director's early period. It is also rather lacking in humour, apart perhaps from the brief scene in the taxidermist's shop. Most importantly, however, is the question of pace and timing. At 72 minutes the original is one of Hitchcock's shortest films, and its concision and brevity are well suited to the thriller genre. The 1956 version is nearly twice as long, even though it omits the shootout scene, and as a result lacks some of the urgency and pace which characterised its predecessor. The Albert Hall scene, for example, is far too drawn out- perhaps Benjamin insisted on his composition being head in full, or nearly so- and much of the tension is thereby dissipated. Sometimes a talented amateur can beat the professional at his own game. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific entertainment down to the final note!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Not one of the master's most groundbreaking work, but with everything we have come to expect from him. Only Alfred Hitchcock could do a remake of his own work and survive much criticism. In fact, opinion still varies whether this 1956 color remake of his 1934 classic THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH improves upon the original. But whatever the case may be, this bigger-budgeted remake, when judged as a stand-alone effort, has all of the master's trademarks. From the performances to some larger-than-life key sequences, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH is an often underrated minor masterpiece. Changing the locale from Switzerland to Morocco, Hitch remains faithful to the original with its story about Dr. Ben McKenna (James Stewart), along with his wife Jo (Doris Day) and son Hank (Christopher Olsen), are on a family holiday in Marrakesh, which quickly turns in to a really bad day and eventually an ultimate family nightmare. First, a spy dressed as a local dies in Ben's arms, whispering to him a chilling message: a man is to be assassinated in London. To assure the couples' silence, Hank is kidnapped and threatened to be killed. Undaunted, the McKennas head for London in hopes to find their kidnapped son and maybe, try to stop the assassination from taking place, which leads to the film's popular Albert Hall sequence. Music plays an integral part in the movie, especially during the famous Albert Hall assassination sequence where Arthur Benjamin's "Storm Cloud Cantata" (the same piece used the original) plays in the background for 12 minutes without a single word of dialogue; Hitchcock at his best in creating suspense. Even the film's theme song "Que Sera, Sera" sung by Doris Day (which won an Oscar) was used relevantly during the film's climax. Stewart is effective in his everyman role as the father in jeopardy, but Day steals the show in a superb dramatic performance. Flaws (some of the impressive locations shots are made less effective by some unconvincing rear projection shots) and plot holes aside, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH is splendid entertainment which is everything that we have come to expect from the one and only Master of Suspense. Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a Hitch that has not endured</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood made a meal out of "Doris Day" (assumed name) after she quit touring with swing bands and musicians who married her and beat her up, and fluked a lead role in 1948, which led on to huge stardom in a world of male stars. However, men continued to make a meal of her, and Marty Melcher (third minder/husband) and his biz partner, shyster-lawyer Jerry Rosenthal squandered her fortune for her, leaving her broke and existing on a small property in Carmel, CA.Hitch deployed her at the peak of her fame opposite James Stewart, but she was radically miscast, plugging a tedious ditty she didn't like (Que Sera, Sera), and acting without direction from Hitchcock (eventually she had to ask him if she was doing okay, and he merely said 'yes'). Knowing all this gives a certain piquancy to her brave and sunny smile: manipulated and bullied at home and manipulated and ignored at work. Yep, she was the last of the long-suffering women. She finally achieved the status of virgin MILF, but had probably in reality been rendered frigid by years of abuse, thus her very peculiar image, which was particularly popular in Britain; well, it would be, wouldn't it...Hitch had a huge budget for this star vehicle, and as always it bloated his style and blurred his focus. Everything is wrong about the picture except Hitch's sly sense of humour. Particularly odious today is the horribly dated Que Sera, Sera ditty, and Bernard Herrman's pompous oratorio that provides the infinitely tedious climactic set-piece. I'm astonished to find I can only recommend this film for connoisseurs who wish to view it for the record. Everyone else should stay away.</fullReview>

It seems that lots of people who should know better have only to see the name Hitchcock on the credits of a film to lose all sense of perspective. I had, as it happens, seen this previously on television and found it terrible so why I bought the DVD even for a giveaway ?2 is anyone's guess. I was unable to locate even ONE half decent frame and I was practically SHOUTING at the screen at times, things like WHY IS THERE NO ONE IN CAMDEN TOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY, ditto BAYSWATER. Why was the minister and his wife permitted to desert the Chapel for an undetermined stay in Morocco. WHY, with no one in the street outside, is the chapel FULL on, presumably, a weekday afternoon. Tazidermists are usually one-man businesses, can there REALLY be so much interest to support a HUGE Taxidermy factory? All this before we get to the complete lack of chemistry between any two members of the cast. Truly they walk amongst us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Hitchcock I've Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of classic Hitchcock, and I've seen most of them. He typically has a knack for weaving stories with normal people in incredible circumstances that play remarkably naturally. And then there's this movie. Without spoiling anything, this is the story of an American family traveling abroad that gets mixed up in something dangerous. They are in way over their heads. And they proceed to act utterly unnaturally at every turn, moving like pieces to a board game, serving the plot, instead of empathetic characters. To give Hitchcock, there are some great suspenseful sequences, but ultimately they were ruined by how dumb the characters were. I wasn't into the story. It was so bad that in the midst of the most suspenseful parts, all I wanted to due was turn off the movie. I am pretty capable of suspending disbelief. But this one really crossed the line. It's possible this is because my expectations are so high for Hitchcock. I won't hold this against him, everyone's allowed to have a dud (though I can't understand why this one is well regarded by anyone).My suggestion, if you want to watch some Hitchcock, pick something else. There are so many, and I've seen most. You probably can't go wrong picking a different one of his films. Rope. North by Northwest. Psycho. Vertigo. Rear Window. Dial M for Murder. Strangers on a Train. Rebecca. Notorious. Pick any other them, I just recommend you don't watch The Man Who Knew Too Much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's remake of "The Man Who Who Knew Too Much," is usually not considered to be as good as the original, but for me it is one of the best films ever. I prefer it over "Vertigo" and "Rear Window."Like "North By Northwest," it is the story of an average man who is unwillingly thrown into the world of international intrigue. James Stewart plays the father of a son who is kidnapped because he is mistaken for an international spy. He will do anything to make sure he gets his son back and protect his family.While the original was good for it's time, it is hard to watch by today's standards. The remake has excellent production quality, an endearing Doris Day, and a really creepy villain. Don't bother to rent this one because you will want to see it over and over.</fullReview>

Stewart is a doctor and Day is a world famous singer. They meet a Frenchman who speaks the native language and helps them out of an incident on a local bus. Later one, the Frenchman whispers something into Stewart's ear after he is attacked and dying. The rest of the film is a puzzle as Stewart tries to save them and solve the mystery. The movie is steeped in mystery and strangeness from the exotic locale to the odd occurrences. You never really know what's going on in this film, why people are appearing, until the end and even then you're not sure. The final scene takes place in Albert Hall and is one of the most famous in film which lasts for 12 minutes with no dialog. Hitchcock had originally made this film in 1934.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is some fine Hitchcock stuff in this rather stiff remake of His earlier version. It has an unmistakable Fifties gloss and sheen with some sensibilities that are indicative of that most Artificial of Decades. This is not quite the Thriller it pretends to be hampered by a few very awkward Scenes. The one in the Taxidermist Shop is the most glaring.But there are others, The Restaurant fumbling and bumbling about eating Customs, and the embarrassing banter about paying for the Vacation from the Doctor's suffering Patients. A lot of this reeks as Elitist nonsense. That is not to say that there aren't some fine things going on in this rather long Movie.Doris Day surprises and stands Her own along Jimmy Stewart and quite a large Cast of "pinkies up" types and greasy Villains. Although Her belting rendition of the Oscar Winner, Que Sera Sera near the end may be a little hard on the ears. The Albert Hall sequence is justifiably Famous, but the protracted aftermath may have stretched things a bit.Overall, there are enough Hitchcock touches to make this above Average Movie Entertainment, but it seems purposely padded. That leads this to Midrange Post-War Hitchcock, certainly not near the Top with so many other Great Films from the Director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A vacationing American couple unwittingly becomes involved in an assassination plot when its son is kidnapped. Hitchcock was at the peak of his creative powers in the 1950s, but, despite the star power of Stewart and Day, this is one of the director's lesser efforts. Of the eleven films he made during the decade, this one ranks ahead of only "Stage Fright" and "To Catch a Thief." The story is entertaining enough, but the pacing is too lethargic to sustain the suspense. Day warbles, "Que Sera, Sera," which became her signature song. Herrmann not only adds another of his fine scores (although not as good as his later works for Hitchcock) but also appears on screen as a conductor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of Hitchcock's worst, a remake of his infinitely better 1935 film. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, and the 1934 version is a small masterpiece. In many ways, I like Hitch's grittier British works with their dark black &amp; white cinematography. The Master tries to outdo himself by casting James Stewart and filming in color. While the first decision works out fine, the second diminishes the film a lot. However, the worst decision was to cast Doris Day. I admit I've never watched a whole film starring this actress, and I have to admit that her performance here makes me want to avoid all the rest of her movies. She sucks! There's not two ways about it, her performance here is hugely embarrassing, over-emoting at every corner. Her rendition of the famous song `Que Sera Sera' is painful to listen to. I have heard other recordings of her singing the song, and they sounded much, much better. Hitchcock tries for a slow build, but ends up taking forever. It only picks up when Stewart invades the church full of bad guys, and the Albert Hall sequence is probably a bit better than the original (that's the only bit of the film that even comes close). The final nail in the coffin comes with the groan-inducing final joke. Maybe it's just me, but I hated it. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather mediocre film from Hitch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not too impressed with this effort, it seemed like Hitchcock paint by the numbers. In this film I feel that Hitchcock tried to blend elements of humor and suspense, much as he did very well in later films such as "North by Northwest" and "To Catch a Thief", but in this film it just did not work out for whatever reason. I think that some of the lighter more humorous moments earlier in the film, scenes that might fit in well with a non-Hitchcock Doris Day or Jimmy Stewart film, clash mightily with the theme of a family whose son is kidnapped. I think the events as they unfold in the movie, particularly after the kidnapping, are highly improbable and therefore do not maintain the level of suspense that they should. For instance the scenes where we're supposed to be getting nervous because the policemen are leaving and saying Scotland Yard will come soon, that scene didn't work for me. And the whole element with them thinking that "Ambrose Chappel" is a person and them not even thinking about it being a place is very hokey. You could see it a mile away. That kind of gimmick worked in the 30s when sound technology was so new, but by the 50s that device based only on a simple pun is very stale and dated, I doubt anyone was really surprised by it at that time much less now.The performances are OK, but nothing really outstanding. The best scene in terms of acting for me is the scene where Stewart gives Day sedatives, telling her they are tranquilizers. Day's performance at this point is truly a knockout. But then after she awakes, it's almost as if all of that never happened. She buries those emotions pretty deep, you could say, but to me it was almost like the movie was too concerned with going back to suspense, there wasn't much interest in making this a dramatic film.I think the ending dragged on WAY too long as well. They should have found a way to resolve it at Ambrose Chappel. The whole part with them at the ambassador's house, and having Day sing "C'est Sera, Sera" for a second time was just too much.If I had seen this movie in 1954 I would have thought that Hitchcock was starting to lose it. Thankfully he still had a few more great films left in him after this one, but I don't see much point in anyone seeking this out unless they are hardcore Hitchcock junkies. It's not a bad film, it's just very dated and not very suspenseful or funny though it tries to be both. Skip it and rent "To Catch a Thief" instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've seen Lawrence of Arabia recently, this looks like "Africa for Dummies" for the first fifteen minutes - or perhaps "how to be an annoying American tourist in Africa." Generally, the movie delves a little too much into international relations (because it has a very superficial idea of them) - which is rare for Hitch, who usually gives us just what we want, without messing around.But the movie begins propre when it gets to the marketplace scene, where a man Jimmy Stewart and his wife (Doris Day) have just met gets stabbed in the back and dies in Stewart's arms, but not before he tells him a piece of information: that a man will be assassinated at a certain place and time. Plus, their son is kidnapped. This is where our suspense comes from.The best thing about The Man Who Knew Too Much is actually Bernard Hermann's cameo. This movie is one of the only places you get to see what Bernard Hermann looked like. Its pretty fun - his music actually plays a part in the climactic scene of the espionage plot. During his "Storm Cloud Cantata" an assassination will happen when it gets to the final cymbal crash! Will Jimmy Stewart stop it in time? Its a terrific use of baiting, wonderful suspense and a terrific sequence. Just before it, there's a poster saying "Bernard Hermann" at the Albert Hall, and then during the scene he appears (as himself), conducting the orchestra.The rest of the movie pales in comparison. Its good - no major flaws - but just not exciting Hitchcock. If you love his colourful 50's films like Rear Window, Trouble with Harry, Vertigo), and like the Jimmy Stewart Hitch pictures, then this might be worth a look. If you can stand Doris Day, that might help. Its slick, but i won't remember these characters' names or the plot tomorrow. 7/10.</fullReview>
