		<shortDescription>De Palma's first Hitchcockian thriller, and still one of his best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brian De Palma is often unfairly dismissed as "that guy that rips off Hitchcock", a statement that overlooks the variety of his output. Of his twenty-odd full length movies only a handful have been thrillers, in fact before 'Sisters' he was best know as a maker of quirky comedies like 'Greetings' and 'Get To Know Your Rabbit'. 'Sisters' was De Palma's first foray into Hitchcock territory, and I think his subsequent stereotyping shows just how impressive he was in this genre. He has made several more famous and successful movies subsequent to this one, but it still remains one of his most entertaining works. Margot Kidder, a few years prior to her fame as Lois Lane, is brilliant as troubled separated siamese twins with a secret. Jennifer Salt ('Midnight Cowboy') plays a spunky newspaper columnist who believes she has witnessed one of the twins commit a murder (a deliberate nod to 'Rear Window'). She cannot get the police to believe her and begins to do her own investigations, helped by a small time private eye Larch (Charles Durning - 'Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?'). She finds out that there is a lot more to the sisters' than meets the eye, and vows to find out what is really going on. Kidder is of course the star of the movie, but equally memorable is De Palma regular William Finley ('The Phantom Of The Paradise', 'Eaten Alive') in a wonderfully creepy performance as one of twins ex-husband. Kidder and Finley and De Palma's assured direction, which includes a brilliant murder sequence and cool use of split screen in another, make this a thriller that won't easily be forgotten. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SISTERS (1973)starring: Margot Kidder, Jennifer Salt, Charles Durning, Lisle Wilson.plot: Actress Danielle Breton (Margot Kidder) is a Siamese twin whose other half is a crazed murderer. When Danielle brings a man (Lisle Wilson) home, she wakes up to discover that he has been brutally butchered. Reporter Grace Collier (Jennifer Salt) witnessed the murder through her window and knows that either Danielle or her twin is the killer, so she launches her own investigation.the good: A slasher starring Margot Kidder with Brian de Palma directing has to be great. And this was no exception.As far as I know, this is de Palma's very first horror film and he did perfectly. It just goes to prove that even though his films are mostly stolen from Hitchcock's PSYCHO or his other films, he can still make them just as great.I had fun figuring out which sister was the killer, and if the reporter could prove there has been a murder. Trust me, it will keep you guessing the whole way through.So check this film out and have a great time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Palma's first horror film (I believe)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reporter Grace Collier (Jennifer Salt) witnesses a brutal murder in an apartment across from her. The murderess is Dominiqie Breton (Margot Kidder) who has a twin sister Danielle (also Kidder). Danielle is sweet and kind, Dominique is a psychopath. Danielle and her creepy ex-husband Emil (Bill Finley) cover up the killing but Grace is determined to find the body.Creepy, violent, very bloody (the first murder is still shocking even by today's standards) and just great. Kidder and Charles Durning (as a detective) give great performances. Salt and Finley are just OK. De Palma's direction is fantastic (as always)--some of the sequences (especially the one employing a split screen) are incredible. Also Bernard Herrmann's score is among one of the best of his career. In terms of horror movie scores, it's right up there with "Psycho" and "Halloween". A good, gory, satisfying film...one of De Palma's best. Look for Olympia Dukakis as a bakery shop worker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>takes cues from Hitchcock and then takes a leap forward; De Palma's best, most bizarre comedy/thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd have to say that this film, though sometimes just shamefully manipulative for audience reaction (and I say that sort of as a compliment), is one of De Palma's very best films, both artistically and just in sheer entertainment value. It's got the low-budget quality of an AIP production, but set apart from Roger Corman's films or other films from the company. It's got such a strange, occasionally off-the-hinges, but dedicated wit that it's hard to ignore. In fact, this wit, and a good number of tight, screwed-up close-up angles, special point of view takes, and some of De Palma's trademarks (split-screen, ambiguous villain, women in trouble, etc) are what set it apart from being a complete Hitchcock homage. It's no doubt that the director is so in love with the Master's style that, apparently, he even times his edits and shots to go with Bernard Herrmann's music. But what sets Sisters apart from even the more macabre Hitchcock films is that since De Palma is working in a low-budget, under-the-radar, with actors with not much credit to their names, things can be taken further than usual in dealing with the psychological 'whoas' of what goes on. This is possibly one of the most morbid tales to be told in 70's cinema.Another important aspect to Sisters and its success is the faith that De Palma has in his actors/friend Margot Kidder and Jennifer Salt. They fit their roles so well one can't imagine big-name actors doing them any better (though Salt, up until the last act, is playing it all appropriately one-note). Kidder's Danielle/Dominique is quite a character too, one with so much complexity her story becomes like some wild ball of string that gets unraveled with little blood-laden marks along the road. Danielle brings home a truly nice guy, Phillip (good character actor, Lisle Wilson), sleeps with him, and then goes ape when she doesn't get her medicine...or is it her sister, Dominique? This first half hour is like some kind of satirical, sincere kind of film-making that could make just a great, open-ended short film. But with the addition of De Palma's split screen (possibly the best he's used it in any of his films), the story spins off into Grace, a reporter who gets on the case on her own to find out what happened to the body. This leads her into a very dark place, one that leads her into something so bizarre I dare not mention here.But those last fifteen-twenty minutes or so are where things become a kind of make-or-break test in a sense for the audience; how far can one push this overtly surreal quagmire of a scene where the 'doctor' is present in front of our two main actresses? The 'doctor' himself is played by William Finley, and it would be arguable that his is such a toweringly creepy, scary performance of a villain that it becomes almost too uncanny. In this climax one has to wonder how far it will go, and then it becomes clear that it's almost the point of the story to go over the edge like this. We're dealt with an already peculiar premise of two Siamese twins, one of whom may or may not be alive, and how they're let loose onto the world. Early on it seems like this might just be an off-beat, funny noir kind of story, but by the end it becomes a bit more. It takes originality to pull off some of the scenes here, or at least faith in what's written will work on screen. In a way this is the best place to see the bridge of De Palma's early black comedies (Hi Mom, Greetings; the neat opening TV show scene brings this to mind) and the hit or miss thrillers that have dominated his long career. Basically, for me, this was a hit, and that it was manipulative, sordid, and left the viewer still wanting some answers, makes it as successful a wink (if not homage) to Hitchcok that the filmmaker has done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vintage DePalma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brian DePalma made his feature length horror debut with "Sisters" ? a delightfully sinister film in the tradition of Alfred Hitchcock. Unfortunately, DePalma has endured an unfair amount of backlash over the years from both critics and moviegoers a like who feel his work too closely resembles that of Hitchcock. One major difference between the two is where Hitchcock played on the imagination of the audience as a tool to generate shock and horror, DePalma gleefully pushes the envelope a step further in staging stylized yet graphically brutal murders that the camera does not shy from. There are two such sequences in "Sisters" and they both still stand today, some thirty-two years later, as extremely unsettling and highly effective scenes (the visibly fake blood notwithstanding). And while one cannot deny that the majority of DePalama's repertoire borrows liberally from Hitchcock, DePalma is still a master of the macabre in his own right (after all, imitation has been called the highest form of flattery). And despite what the critics say, DePalma IS credible in the eyes of his loyal legion of fans ? based on his strong skill of affectionately paying homage, while at the same time invigorating the material with his own flair of unique visual imagery. And in this manner, "Sisters" does not disappoint. By combining his then experimental split screen technique with a brilliantly unsettling score by composer icon Bernard Herrmann, a "Rear Window" esquire story, and an eerie crackerjack sort of ending ? DePalma successfully creates a truly thrilling viewing experience. The film also succeeds in not taking itself too seriously and is further buoyed by definitively camp performances from lead actresses Margot Kidder and Jennifer Salt. The brief yet brutal violence and far-fetched plot may put off some viewers, however the film is highly recommended to genre enthusiasts and a must see for Brian DePalma die hards, an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nancy Drew (Jennifer Salt) would kill to get off of Staten Island and become the maverick of NYC journalism. The only problem is that all she has done to this point with her 'little job" is write about rampant police corruption, isolating herself even further from the big city. What she needs is a break, and witnessing a murder, (especially a DePalma split-screen murder) appears to be her ticket, if she can get anyone to listen. The journey she takes as means of recognition meanders through the horrors of medical science gone awry, culminating in a payoff that puts this film atop DePalma's list of credits.

		<fullReview>Hang on to your psychoanalysis, Ladies and Gentlemen...a young Brian De Palma has brought us a fine mindf*ck that is in good company with "Psycho," "The Tenant," and even "Fight Club." "Sisters" is a brain-sizzling thriller that probes the relationship between separated Siamese twins Danielle and Dominique (Margot Kidder) in a maniacally unsettling way. Danielle is a successful actress/model; Dominique is a raving lunatic who becomes violent when sexually aroused. When Dominique murders Danielle's boyfriend, reporter Grace Collier (Jennifer Salt) takes matters into her own hands after the police refuse to help. Meanwhile, Danielle's ex-husband Emil (John Waters doppleganger William Finley) runs a local psych ward. And Charles Durning plays a detective tracking the progress of a particularly heavy couch. De Palma weaves his character interactions seamlessly, employing the types of technical tricks that would be used more superficially in his later works (the use of split-screen to show action from two separate viewpoints, for instance), in addition to some of the trippiest black-and-white imagery this side of "Eraserhead." "Sisters" is an effective, highly influential work that holds up incredibly well today...just make sure you have a refill on your pills before watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I viewed it was in 2003, on cable television. Considering that it was a Brian DePalma film, I was expecting something interesting and suspenseful. I really enjoyed his films BLOW-OUT(1981), and THE UNTOUCHABLES(1987). Here were two films where he demonstrated his effective use of creating suspense that was more integral to the plot. After recently re-watching his 1973 shocker, SISTERS, my opinion of him has been unchanged.Sure, maybe there are things about it, such as visuals and styles,that are extremely similar to Hitchcock, but I thought that this movie was completely original story wise. The opening sequence is very cleverly played out so that you don't quite know what you're going to watch and by the end you are surprised by the direction it takes. The story involves a woman who says that her identical twin sister lives with her and is apparently crazy. This may ring a bell with Hitchcock fans as sounding a little too familiar and indeed it does as there are very similar events that somewhat mirror scenes from his films. Before long, an innocent man is murdered and we are immediately introduced to a woman reporter who believes that there is something amiss. Afterward, the movie gets very creative with some of the strangest characters. The film also ends with a weird twist that seems to have some sci-fi overtones to it.Despite being a little twisted and confusing toward the end, the film is very well made and effectively scary. I wouldn't recommend the film to people who don't really like thinking during movies as this film has an ending that leaves a confusing plothole behind. It is the kind of plot hole that was left in too obviously to be done on accident. But I guess that's part of the charm of DePalma. All of his films offer something similar in the suspense element, but different in every other way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De palma's best Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a very young 13 years of age when I first saw Brian De Palma's 'Sisters' when it first arrived in theaters in 1973. I was captivated and intrigued by the warning included on the theatrical poster outside of the movie theater. The caption within an inset box read-"No one will be seated during a special 'shock recovery' period". Of course this had me feeling ill before I even entered the auditorium in nervous expectation. Well from the very opening of the film we find our leading man lisle Wilson the unknowing subject of a surreal game show 'peeping toms'. The lead in music by the always brilliant Bernard Herrmann creates an unsettling and frightening mood. You can almost taste the psychologically evil direction of the film from the very beginning. Further through as we are introduced to our two main characters played by Wilson and Margo kidder we are carried through this with a very smooth dreamlike and creepy feel thanks largely to the incredible soundtrack Herrmann had created here. Once the terror hits us we are not exactly clueless that it is going to take place. But certainly de palma created the the first murder sequence this way intentionally. We know it is going to happen but we pray it doesn't. Well it does- and to terrifying results. The murder of our short lived leading man has to be one of the most shocking scenes ever filmed. The violent and relentless way in which this demonic 'alter ego/other sister' perpetrates murder is to suggest that the way in which she murders her victim is without any restraint and completely sadistic. This scene is certainly carried to terrifying depth through Bernard Herrmann's electrifying score, and now we see the ranting, jerking of the insanity of a serial killer... At only 13 I thought my heart was going to stop, I was mortified. De palma still leaves plenty for us as the audience to think about. Is the other half of these separated siamese twins real or imagined? Is she dead or is she perhaps possessing the body of her sister that is still living? These are questions that give us the mystery we are looking for. The always mystical and beautiful jennifer Salt (daughter of writer and producer Waldo Salt) portrays a reporter named Grace Collier, who witnesses this murder. The police are at odds with her, and for reasons that are quickly revealed. They have reason to question if her claims of a murder in the apartment across the way are real or some scheme grace has cooked up. For the rest of the film Grace plays the part of detective to attempt prove that the murder really did happen aided by a private eye (Charles Durning). What Grace finally finds out is truly terrifying. 'Sisters' is filled with plenty of good scares, creative split screen sequences, and plenty of dreamy nightmarish images. And then there is de palma's ala- hitchcock, which at times is more hitchcock than hitchcock. Bill Finley is especially superb as a quirky and creepy ex-husband. I can hardly understand why some people didn't care for this movie. 'Sisters' may have lost some of it's freight factor after 32 years, but it is still one of the best psychological thrillers ever made despite some moments that are less than perfect. I highly recommend this scary masterpiece. I highly recommend 'Sisters'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of De Palma's finest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Brian De Palma's first Hitchcockian thriller was this bizarre and ever-so mysterious shocker.Beautiful woman desperately tries to cover up the murder that her psychotic twin sister has committed, while a reporter who witnessed the crime tries to expose it.Many criticize Brian De Palm's thrillers for being derivative of the works of the great Alfred Hitchcock, but even still his thrillers are brilliant and Sisters is no exception! De Palma sets up this film with an intriguing and mysterious story that grows more complex and sinister the deeper one sinks into it. De Palma's direction is wonderfully inventive and well-carries the film. From the films dramatic opening credits to its unsettling final image, the style of De Palma is simply spell binding! He produces one terrifically shocking murder sequence and one of the most hypnotic (and creepy) dream sequences ever! Kudos also go to the great Bernard Herrmann for his outstandingly frightening score.Actress Margot Kidder does one of her greatest performances, as both the beautiful model and her deranged twin. Jennifer Salt is also good as the female reporter. De Palma-regular William Finely is well sinister as a mysterious doctor and Charles During is good as a P.I.Not to be missed by thriller fans and required viewing for those who love the works of Brian De Palma.*** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

Unfortunately it can't carry itself through to the end, and soon collapses into a confusing, formulaic, and ridiculous ending that obviously tries to cover up the fact that, well, De Palma simply didn't know HOW to end the film. Nonetheless it is essential viewing for fans of shock cinema, psychological horror, or cod-Hitchcock fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Palma's first thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to Freud, the human infant, while either biologically male or female, is not innately "masculine" or "feminine". In order to construct the socially correct "man" or "woman" of patriarchy, the little girl's "masculinity" and the little boy's "femininity" must therefore be repressed by external pressures and social forces.This repression tends to be particularly damaging in the male, where it is compounded by the pervasive association of "femininity" with "castration" on both the literal and symbolic levels. Indeed, the significance of De Palma's best work lies in its eloquent evidence of what happens when the repression is partially unsuccessful, these films tending to revolve around the tensions and contradictions arising out of the way in which gender has been traditionally constructed in a male dominated culture"Sisters" is therefore single-mindedly concerned about castration. Or rather, the symbolic castration of women within patriarchy and the responsive literal castration that is the form of her revenge. As such, the film centres on Siamese twins (one active and aggressive, one passive and submissive), the film's conflicts arising out of the attempts of men to systematically destroy the active aspect in order to construct the "feminine" woman who will accept her subordination.Thus, De Palma has one aggressive sister called Dominique (dead, but still alive as her sister's unconscious) parallelled by Grace Collier (Jennifer Salt), the assertive young reporter who usurps the accoutrements of "masculinity" and eventually assumes Dominique's place in De Palma's extraordinary climactic hallucination sequence in which the woman's castration is horrifyingly reasserted. This all mirrors the gender wars found in De Palma's later films ("The Fury" and "Carrie"), most notably "Dressed to Kill", in which Michael Caine's castration anxieties stem from his inability to actualise a literal sex change.Of course, this being De Palma, "Sisters" is also obsessed with themes of voyeurism and what the director calls, "image validity". Consider the film's opening sequence. After a long montage of floating twin foetuses, the film opens with a man in a changing room. A blind woman then enters and begins to undress. We the audience are then faced with an uncomfortable question? Do we watch or look away? Then suddenly a giant keyhole appears over the man's head and we pull back to reveal that we the audience are watching a television screen in which the man and woman are on a voyeur-like reality TV series called "Peeping Tom" (an obvious nod to M. Powell). A question is then put to the contestants on the show. Does the man in the changing room A) look away B) leave the room C) watch her undress? This notion of mediated voyeurism is carried on throughout the rest of the film, as De Palma's camera shoots interior scenes externally through windows or frames, his compositions mimicking a TV screen.In terms of flaws, the film's only real flaw is De Palma's attempt to hide the "split personality" of the main character. While such shock tactics were novel in the early 70s, countless TV rip offs have now rendered this part of the "mystery" pretty tame. Secondly, due to budget constraints, and De Palma's inexperience, the film lacks the sheer balletic grace of De Palma's later work. 7.9/10- "Sisters" is intensely cinematic and features a brilliant score by Bernard Hermann. The film severely loses tension toward the last act, but makes up for it all with a classic final scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sisters are doing it for themselves?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sisters is directed by Brain De Palma who also co-writes the screenplay with Louisa Rose. It stars Margot Kidder, Jennifer Salt, Charles Durning, Lisle Wilson and William Finley. Music is by Bernard Herrmann and cinematography by Gregory Sandor.When newspaper reporter Grace Collier (Salt) observes what she perceives to be a murder in the apartment across the street from her own, it proves to be the catalyst for a trip down a dark psychologically damaged street.To be honest here, the continuous complaints about De Palma being a Hitchcock clone got boring around about the mid eighties. As Hitch is my personal favourite director it has never bothered me one bit that he homaged and borrowed from the great man's cannon, in fact I have always found that when on form it was great to have someone like De Palma to keep the suspense thriller genre going. It's not as if he's the only one who owes his career to director's from the past really is it?Sisters is a wonderfully trippy suspenser, where De Palma lifts from some great Hitchcock motifs to portray a clinically edgy story based around an article he read about Siamese twins Masha and Dasha Krivoshlyapova. Infused with technical flourishes such as split screens, POV filming and close quarter framing, the director is donating his own blood for the veins of the piece. Suspense is rarely far away, be it characters in some sort of danger, or the possible discovery of a body, there is no pause for pointless filler fodder. While twists and revelations engage the brain instead of insulting it, something many of today's horror/thriller directors could learn to "homage" from actually, and a nightmare section of film literally unfurled out of the minds eye is top draw.Herrmann was enticed out of near retirement to score the music, the genre and themes at work in the story ready made for his skilled compositions. The score in all essence is lifted from his own major works for Hitchcock, with added sections taken from Jason and the Argonauts and Mysterious Island, but reworked in such away it drifts a perfectly off-kilter vibe across production. Kidder and Salt do great work in tricky roles, and Finley is suitably edgy. Durning is a little wasted, though, but it's a small complaint in the acting area. There's a couple of plot holes and one turn of events that just doesn't make sense, but this is a prime De Palma thriller and a good starting point for anyone interested in his work. And yes! For anyone who really isn't bothered about someone homaging a past master. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DEPALMA'S FIRST THRILLER IS AMONG HIS BEST</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sisters" is Brian DePalma's first thriller, made on a rather cheap budget of $500,000. While it is not as accomplished as his later thrillers ("Obsession", "Dressed to Kill", "Blow Out"), "Sisters" is just as terrifying and brilliant as the other films are."Sisters" is possibly the DePalma film that most echoes Hitchcock (with maybe the exception of "Obsession"; that's up to debate). Besides "Psycho", it also has shades of "Rear Window" and even "Saboteur" (as one person pointed out here). It even has a score by Bernard Herrmann, Hitchcock's most prominent composer. But DePalma, as in his other thrillers, takes everything one step further and makes the genre his own."Sisters" plays on the sexual voyeurism that Hitchcock only hinted at in his best films. After opening with a fairly funny spoof of TV game shows, we are thrust into the main story. It involves Siamese twins who were separated. We meet the good twin Danielle (Margot Kidder) in the opening segments and she looks normal enough. But there are a few questions........like who is the funny looking man who trails her constantly? And where is her twin Dominique, who happens to be the evil twin? And why is the word "HELP!" smeared in blood on the window of her apartment? More importantly, where is the body?Those are the questions that our heroine asks. Grace Collier (Jennifer Salt, very good here), a reporter who has bad blood with the police, witnesses a murder while looking out her window. No one believes her, but that doesn't stop her from setting out to solve the murder herself. She hires a private detective (Charles Durning, hilarious in his brief role)and an archivist (Barnard Hughes), but while they provide some help, there is still no answers.....I can't say anymore because I'll really be spoiling some of DePalma's great surprises. But I will say that "Sisters" provides some real chills in the final 25 minutes of the film and the ending is absolutely perfect in every way. DePalma writes a good script and tells a good story with many unexpected twists and turns. The blood is a little too fake, but one can accept it because this is a film with its' tongue so firmly in cheek. The performances are really what make this film work. A real surprise is how good Margot Kidder is in this film. She has rarely been given good roles in films, but DePalma really gives her a demanding and difficult role which she pulls off flawlessly. It will come as a surprise to those who know her best as Lois Lane in "Superman". Another surprise is Jennifer Salt's work. She has the most thankless of roles (think of Vera Miles' role in "Psycho") but she makes it her own here. She doesn't resort to the usual cliches and suggests a flawed heroine who gets into this case a little too deep. It's superb work. Also memorable is DePalma regular Bill Finley ("Phantom of the Paradise", "The Fury")as the mystery man. Again, he could have given an over the top portrayal, but he manages to give a performance of restraint and coolness. It's quite a change from "Phantom of the Paradise" (released a year after this, but made before), but it shows a good talent at work. Charles Durning and Barnard Hughes make the most of their brief roles and create memorable characters."Sisters" may look cheap at times, but compared to such overpriced and predictable thrillers like "Scream 2" and "Phantoms", it's a superior film. DePalma proves that you don't need a lot of money to make a superb thriller. This deserved a slot on the recent AFI 100 Best Thrillers list and it is a sign of our times that it didn't make it. It is an even bigger sign of the overwhelming stupidity that is polluting Hollywood.**** out of 4 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Example of the REAL De Palma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>De Palma don't make 'em like this anymore. Brilliant, creepy psychological thriller concerning French-Canadian twin sisters Danielle and Dominique (Margot Kidder). One is seemingly normal and one is seemingly insane. One is an actress who, while on a game show, wins dinner with one of its contestants, Philip (Lisle Wilson). The two have an enjoyable time, and even end up spending the night together back at her apartment. The next day, Philip awakens to the two sisters arguing in the next room. Danielle then asks Philip to go into town and purchase some more medicine for her. He does so and, out of the kindness of his heart, purchases a birthday cake for the sisters, since today is their birthday. Upon his return, the thrills begin and Jennifer Salt decides to investigate these weird goings-on. SISTERS is a very eerie thriller from Brian De Palma which features his outstanding scriptwriting/direction, Paul Hirsch's top-notch editing, Bernard Hermann's welcome nerve-jangling score, not to mention the awesome split-screen, enabling us to see two events at one time. Despite the ultimately strange conclusion, the film is a creeper and not to be missed. 9/10</fullReview>

Hitchcock buffs will undoubtedly enjoy catching references to Rear Window, Rope and most obviously Psycho. And am I the only one wondering if DePalma was also inspired by Hitchcock's Saboteur (the scene where Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane hide in the circus freak-show caravan includes a pair of bickering Siamese twins... early incarnation of Dominique and Danielle?).

		<shortDescription>"I saw a murder, and I'm going to prove it!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sisters is a very well made low-budget thriller form Brian De Palma with a few very shocking moments and, unfortunately, a couple of serious flaws that keep me from rating it any higher. The basic premise of the psychological impact of being separated Siamese twins is, as far as I know, rather unique. De Palma handles this portion very well and in a believable manner. In lesser hands, Sisters might have disintegrated into the ridiculous psycho-babble I've heard once too often. As for shocking moments, the main murder in the film is rather unexpected and caught me off-guard in its viciousness. The low-budget special effects only add to the brutality of the images on screen. De Palma also creates a dream sequence near the end of the film that is beautiful and disturbing at the same time. The acting in Sisters is at least adequate with Margot Kidder giving a standout performance. The great Bernard Herrmann contributes a wonderful score.But, as I mentioned, there are a couple of moments that do not work at all. The first is the reporter who "witnesses" the murder. From her vantage point, all she sees is a hand writing something in what appears to be blood on a window. In addition, there's such glare on the window that there is no way she couldn't have seen a whole lot more. Yet she tells the police that she "witnessed" a murder and that the victim was a black man. What? She never saw any of that.My second problem with the movie comes near the end and is part of the dream sequence I mentioned previously. Exposition is fine as long as it's interwoven into the action going on screen. Having characters stop and explain what's going on so the viewer knows what they're seeing can drag a movie to a standstill. And when this type of exposition occurs during the climax of a film, it's unforgivable. During the build-up to the climax are scenes of one character basically telling another what the audience is watching. Maybe I'm being picky, but it really bothered me and hurt the flow of the third act.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For every guy who ever salivated at the thought of "doing" two sisters at the same time, Brian De Palma has a message for you: be careful what you wish for.SISTERS, actually the director's third indie film, was an obvious Hitchcock homage meant to get his foot in the door in Hollyweird, and catch the eye of both critics and a certain discriminating segment of the audience who had an appetite for both horror and suspense. Mission VERY well accomplished, Mr. D.!With severed tongue firmly in impaled cheek, SISTERS brings us the heart-warming story of game show model Danielle Breton (Margot Kidder in early foxy mode), who hits it off with one of the show's contestants, Phillip (Lisle Wilson.) Dating leads to other things, of course, and soon he's back at her place. Danielle sure seems like a nice girl, though there are things about her that are a little 'off'...such as her habit of talking in the next room to herself...or is she?Phillip dating a closet nutcase was a mistake...but an even bigger one is made when he tries to "surprise" a sleeping Danielle with a huge cake for her birthday...and an EVEN BIGGER carving knife to cut it with. One word to the wise, fellas: if you want your psycho girlfriend to cut her cake, give her a SPORK to do it with!Naturally, it's not Danielle who gets the surprise, but Phillip when she decides there's something she likes to carve into pieces better than the cake...HIM!Meanwhile, in an apartment in the building across the way, reporter Grace Collier (Jennifer Salt) sees the horrific murder and witnesses the dying man trying to scrawl "HELP" on the window in his own blood.What follows is the famous sequence that established De Palma as master of the split-screen technique, as an agitated Grace calls the police and tries to convince them about what she saw, while Danielle, completely out of it, is helped by a mysterious man to clean up the scene and hide the body. The better part of the rest of the movie chronicles Grace's growing obsession with Danielle, with proving that while she may not be crazy, Danielle IS, and that she MUST find the truth behind what happened in that apartment, not just as a story, but as a way to solve the mystery of why a man was so brutally murdered. Unfortunately, Grace finds herself in the same position as a certain feline who once had a taste for being 'curious.'Artsy and Hitchcockian in a 'nudge-wink' kind of way, this is the kind of movie that both cinema students and film buffs love, from the zithery-creepy, theramin-spiked Bernard Hermann score, to the "select" casting of character greats like Charles Durning, Barnard Hughes, William Finley (a De Palma favorite) and Dolph Sweet. Extremely controversial in its day and a triumph of sorts for De Palma, the film was still considered a box-office flop, and when the film that followed, PHANTOM OF THE PARADISE, did a ticket "Swann-dive" as well, Brian's name was well on the way to being considered box-office poison.It was a bestselling novel by a first-time writer named Stephen King that changed all of that.But since you've already taken "CARRIE" to the prom, why not try out Danielle as well? This little lady will give you TWO frights for the price of one!And if you think that M. Night Shyamalan has a lock on unsettling endings, I defy you to get a good night's sleep once you've gotten to SISTER'S Warhol-on-the-crackpipe climax.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspense, thrills and grisly killings by imitative director Brian De Palma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This potentially brilliant and ingenious double identity thriller concerns about a Siamese twins(Margot Kidder, previous-Superman) are surgically separated by a doctor(William Finley, pre- Phantom of Opera). One sister is scarred physically and mentally when a murder occur in his apartment. The killing is witnessed by an investigative journalist(Jennifer Salt, post-Midnight cowboy). The intrepid reporter is helped by a private eye (Charles Durning,The fury) . And then things really get worse.This scary triller is plenty of mystery, intrigue, and suspenseful. Adding special characteristics techniques as ominous camera movements and split screen. De Palma's first homage to Hitchcock and the amusement turn out to be inquire what scenes taken from suspense Master. For that reason takes parts from ¨Vertigo, Psycho and Rear Window¨. All this said, the mechanics of suspense are worked quite well and may frighten the easily scared quite badly, but De Palma has made a habit of dwelling on their more sordid side-shoots. The film displays a great musical score by Bernard Hermmann, Hitchock's favorite composer and imitating his former hits. Furthermore appropriate cinematography by cameraman Gregory Sandor. The picture is brilliantly directed by Brian De Palma. This one along with ¨Obsession,Dresssed to Kill, Blow out¨ are outwardly another ode to Hitchcock, but the Master might well shift uneasily in his grave at the long-drawn -out tension, the flash violent scenes and the shock effects with the accent on gas-provoking , but on most occasion without finesse. Rating : Above average but gets some riveting basic ideas and fascinating images.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, Grade-B picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brian DePalma's first foray into Hitchcockism is a fun, creepy, low budget delight. Margot Kidder plays a pair of Siamese twins -one of whom is very handy with a butcher's knife- who become involved with murder, an insane asylum, a cop bashing witness (Jennifer Salt -Jon Voight's luckless girlfriend in Midnight Cowboy &amp; Eunice from Soap), and a scary looking husband (William Finley). All the components of a DePalma are here: the slightly satirical eye, beautiful women, violent deaths, a fantasic score by Bernard Herrmann that's even more effective than the one he composed for Psycho, and set pieces that bring out mixed feelings of dread and dark humor. The film looks like an incredibly polished student job -due to its low budget- except it has a great director and strong actors. It's a good Saturday night flick -especially if you're alone- that makes for compelling entertainment. It's also a reminder that Brian DePalma is a first rate director who hopefully one day be given his due.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterwork</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brian De Palma's first great masterwork tips its hat to Hitchock (A LOT). Margot Kidder plays conjoined twins separated by loony doctor Bill Finley. One of the twins is a psychotic. Local cub reporter Jennifer Salt witnesses a murder committed by one of them, but naturally nobody believes her. She gets caught up in some pretty unsettling shenanigans trying to figure out what happened. De Palma borrows liberally from Hitchcock (and Polanski) and creates one of the most shocking films of the 1970s. Kidder is dynamite and Finley, looking like director John Waters, is very nasty. Salt shows a lot of spunk. The Hitchock connection is solidified via the brilliant music score by none other than Bernard Herrmann. It's very creepy. The excellent editing (complete with split screens) is by Paul Hirsch, who would go on to work with De Palma a lot &amp; won an Oscar editing STAR WARS for George Lucas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy Effective Tense Mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came across this movie a few years ago and I loved it, but only recently I have bought it online and I still love it. Okay this movie may not be to everyone's taste as this is the kind of movie that makes you think. But personally I actually prefer movies like these than say some of the over the top, loud and loaded with special effects that come out these days. It's a shame that director Brian De Palma don't make movies like this anymore and I also enjoyed some of his other gems like (Dressed To Kill, Carrie and Obsession), cause this is where he really shines.The plot = A young woman named Danielle (Margot Kidder) brings home a man named Phillip she met on a game show, avoiding her creepy ex husband Emil (William Finley). Phillip spends the night and ends up getting murdered by her twin sister Dominique, as Danielle and her ex husband cover up the crime, they are unaware that a reporter Grace (Jennifer Salt) has witnessed the crime.This movie displays all the tension and atmosphere in all the right places, Sisters 'style is all about subjectivity. In fact a real strength of Sisters is DePalma's unique flair for blurring reality for dramatic effect.and what makes this movie work are the cast, who along with the movie keeps you interested all the way through. This movie does echo Hitchcock movies "Psycho" and "Rear Window", and also copies his split screen scenario, but it's all done right here one showing the cover up of the crime and the other showing the reporter trying to get to the bottom of what's going on, a different take on what Hitchcock did in his movies, but all the more interesting and disturbing at the same time. The brutal murder as well was effectively done and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time, my only minor bad point is that I figured out the twist very early on in the movie, well maybe it's just me but I found it quite easy and quite oblivious but other than that this movie really works on so many levels.The performances like I've already said really makes this movie work, Margot Kidder well and truly shines in the roles of Danielle/Dominique, in what can be a difficult part, but Margot Kidder does brilliantly displaying vulnerability and innocence in one role, then turning schizo and unhinged in the other, nailing the both roles and making them both human and believable at the same time. Jennifer Salt also gave a good performance, okay I was a bit annoyed at first when the main focus of the movie shifted from Margot Kidder to Jennifer Salt, but all that changed after a short bit, when I got to see her trying to solve the crime herself and quickly became likable and interesting and made me really care about her character. William Finley as the ex-husband gave a really creepy and chilling performance, I admit he even send shivers down my spine, as he tried to control Danielle. Even the supporting turns are played well Charles durning gives a good performance as the private detective and Lisle Wilson as the unlucky Phillip displays all the emotions in the right places and makes you feel sad when he dies.All in all "Sisters" is a tense effective creepy mystery, with outstanding turns from the cast especially Margot Kidder (an underrated actress) in my opinion. A must see for any fans of Brian De Palma a highlight in his list of movies or for any star in this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very interesting murder mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even as early as the 70's Brian Depalma had a knack for making interesting, stylish murder mystery films. His blood is bright red in this just like his later films. Margot Kidder does a fantastic job as Danielle and Dominique, conjoined twins who were separated as adults. Jennifer Salt also does a great job with her character. The women here are strong and leave an indelible mark. There is something very interesting about the twins and the character (Jennifer Salt) who is a witness to a murder in Danielle's apartment. The time flies by watching this. One becomes involved in the mysterious characters and the story moves right along quickly. The entire film has a slight Hitchcock feel to it. I kept thinking of Vertigo-the way Jimmy Stewart talks to Kim Novak. Slightly theatrical.If you are looking for a new mystery/horror film to add to your collection get this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brian De Palma has done well making this suspenseful movie. "Sisters" is a creative since Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho". Here, you have this woman who is divorced, has a twin sister who is unhinged, and there's a murder that seems to be ignored by the police. Margot Kidder plays Danielle, a divorced woman who appeared on a game-show in New York who meets another man named Phillip(Lisle Wilson,1943-2010) who was also in the show, spends the night with her and tried to protect her from her ex-husband. Early in the morning, him being the gentleman he is, he wishes her a happy birthday. Jennifer Salt plays the news reporter who happened to see him get killed. And to make matters worse, the policemen are no help. What does she do, get a private eye, and find the people responsible for this crime. The ex-husband who is a really clever and sneaky tries his best to dis way the reporter from finding out what happened. Parts of the scenes are close to Hitchcock's "Psycho", and the separation ritual was a classic. This movie is like "Psycho" times two! I would recommend this thriller. 3 out of 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The distribution of mind over matter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most excellent sources of horror arises from real or imaginary problems with the distribution of mind over matter. Let's take "The Three Faces of Eve" (1957) or "Sybil" (1976): This is the case where more than 1 person qua mind is in 1 body qua matter. Let's then take the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde topic: This is the case where 2 persons which are in "reality" one are split into two different bodies.But that is not all: In "Sisters" (1973), we have the case that two different persons are grown in two-in-one bodies. Allegedly, when Danielle/Dominique were still non-separated, one sister was light-hearted, the other one melancholic. People could not classify that in another manner as to distribute the basic dichotomy of good vs. evil onto the two sisters. So, after they had been separated, the bad part died with Dominique, but from time to time, the mind of Danielle, like in a state of vacuum, tried to personalize the bad part of the other sister in the bigger idea of reconciling was has been together by nature.For the people in the Middles Ages, where this horror motives root, the dichotomy of Good and Evil was absolute: God stood for good, the devil for evil. A natural mixture of both in every being was refused, because it contradicted the idea of genesis according to which out of God, the representative of good, no evil could emanate. Therefore, most of the horror stories that are based on the distribution of mind over matter, owe their horror motive exactly in the being incommensurable of both good and both evil in 1 person. In the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde-topic, which is nothing else than a sequel of the relationship of God and devil, good and evil are distributed over 2 persons, because the idea of schizophrenia was still far away However, good and evil are completely symmetric, like two-valued logic, where two negations lead back to position! In the case of Sybil or Eve, instead of accepting that these women were more than one person each, one personalized the minds of the non-Eves and non-Sybils with bodies (and thus with matter), in the shape of ghosts and tried to expelled them like in the exorcist-movies. But again, how is it with the case of Danielle and Dominique? When Siamese twins had been described for the first time, the Middle-Ages with their "doppelgangers" and ghosts were already too far back. And neither were the two sisters doubles nor one of them a ghost. But still, the idea of schizophrenia was not understood. Therefore, the good and the evil part of any of the sisters had been again distributed strictly on to one of them each. And although none of the sisters had been mentally sick as long as they were non-separated and alive, the sudden compulsory turn of the surviving sister was explained as the yearning of the mind of the passed on sister for the body of the surviving one. The refusal of the fact that one body can house more than one mind which goes back to Aristotelian metaphysics, has created a thousand-years long, as it seems, never ending chain of fright and horror of its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I saw a murder, and I'm going to prove it! But there was no body because there was no murder,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sisters(1973) - written/directed by Brain DePalma, terrifying but at times funny and always very effective thriller/horror about a murder committed by a beautiful model Danielle Breton - or was it her once-conjoined twin sister Dominique? Or was there any murder at all? Reporter Grace Collier is absolutely sure it was because she saw it by her own eyes from the apartment across the street and she calls to the police at once. Police officers find no evidence whatsoever and Grace decides to investigate the murder herself with the help of private eye Joseph Larch. Investigation brings Grace to a creepy mental asylum where she would find out the truth but what will be the price? Or did she dream it all? Or did Grace descended into madness while hallucinating of the events that happened with Danielle, her former husband and doctor Emil, and Dominique in the scene both Bunuel and Dali would be proud of? DePalma in his interview tells about his fascination with the mystery of Siamese twins which gave him an idea for the script. He also shares his love and admiration for Alfred Hitchcock's movies which "Sisters" remind a lot. Some innocent bystanders get brutally murdered; some -involved in the investigation of the crime they had nothing in common with. There is a musical score written by Bernard Hermann, once regular Hitchcock's composer. Some scenes are direct references to the famous Hitchcock's scenes in "Psycho" and "Rear Window". But the film is undeniably DePalma's - I think his use of the split screen in "Sisters" was simply terrific and added to the building tension. The opening of the film is so typical DePalma - the director teases the viewers by making them believe that they participate in the scene of voyeurism but it is actually a double voyeurism. DePalma who said once that "The camera lies all the time; lies 24 times/second", never ceases to trick his characters as well as his viewers with the difference in what they look at versus what they really see but I don't mind to be tricked by such a visual master with great sense of style and dark humor. Another DePalma's remark could be a key to better understanding and enjoying his film - "I always want them (the viewers) to remember that they watch a movie." I think it is a mistake to take DePalma's movies as realistic and look for logic there. He distorts reality creating "a stylized, expressionistic world that has a kind of grotesque beauty about it".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is no body because there was no murder?Sisters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people out there seem to have some sort of indifference when it comes to the subject of director Brian De Palma. I'm not quite sure what it is, but I have enjoyed every film I've seen by him. In anticipation of his new The Black Dahlia, I decided to revisit one of his earlier films, Sisters. I hadn't seen it in over five years or so, but always remembered finding it intellectually disturbing and containing one of the most surreal, enjoyable endings I've seen. Experiencing it again brought back all the memories and showed that the film holds up pretty well over the thirty-plus years since its release.A murder has taken place and its only witness will not be taken seriously by the police. Reporter Grace Collier (Jennifer Salt) decides to take it upon herself to get to the bottom of the horrific act she witnessed. She enlists a private detective, played by Charles Durning, and goes off to discover what lies in young model Danielle Breton's past. Does she have a twin that she is protecting? Is her creepy ex-husband behind it all? Grace has her hands full and soon gets in over her head. This is the basic plot line of the film; it seems on the surface to be a slight story, but the great acting and direction make it so much more. Yes, there are many instances bringing to mind Hitchcock; between the score done by Bernard Herrmann, a Hitch vet, and a car tailing scene with shots reminiscent to Janet Leigh's drive to the Bate's Motel, you definitely see De Palma wearing his influences on his sleeve. The story is vintage wrong man, whodunit, yet it all culminates into a shocking finale that is unique unto itself.Danielle Breton is played nicely by a young Margot Kidder. She uses a well-executed French- Canadian accent, (at least to my ears), and is believable as the na?ve, defenseless woman caught in the middle of it all. She also does a wonderful job in old film footage as her Siamese twin Dominique, showing the disparate emotional states of the two sisters. Besides Salt and Durning, who both play their parts effectively, the other standout is De Palma stalwart William Finley. Finley plays the ex-husband of Kidder's character, and he is a sight for sure. Creepiness emanates from him throughout the film as one never really can tell for sure what part he plays in the proceedings. The nerdy, coke bottle glasses and classic villianesque smoking brings a foreboding whenever he is on screen. This is definitely perfect casting.For anyone who enjoys cerebral horror, I wholeheartedly recommend seeing this film. It will seem a bit dated when blood is spilled, (fluorescent, thick red goo), yet when one really looks under the surface into the psychological happenings, he/she will see that it stills resonates strongly. The surrealistic finale is unforgettable with dreamlike, old home movie video grain style vignettes containing all the characters we have come across during the film's course. It is definitely unnerving as mental patients are shown in their natural habitat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early De Palma is enjoyable but best seen as a dry run for later masterpieces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although he had made a few films before,Sisters is perhaps the first film in the true De Palma style,you know,the obsession with voyeurism,the show-offy camera-work,the Hitchcock homages,the preferance for long,wordless dreamlike sequences interrupted by bloody violence,etc. Although De Palma HAS made films that are different,he seems to prefer making films that are like this. Sisters has all these elements,albeit sometimes in embryonic form.The model here is obviously Psycho,and De Palma doesn't develop elements of that film as well as in the later Dressed To Kill,but it is interesting to watch. The director just about manages to have enough different elements,while riffing on obvious things from Psycho {such as a shocking murder a third of the way in,the basic plot} and even a bit of Rear Window. Things like split screen keep the interest despite a few dull bits,and towards the end De Palma is confident enough to resolve most of the film with some almost surreal dream/flashback sequences and an amusing pay off.Accompanied by a sometimes TERRIFYING Bernard Herrmann score {nowhere near his best,but incredibly effective},and with plenty of humorous touches and an interesting feminist heroine,Sisters is nowhere near top De Palma,but it's a good dry run for classics like Dressed To Kill and Blow Out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DePalma's first remake of Hitchcock's "Psycho", is also probably his best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't mean this as a put-down. "Psycho" is a classic, and, as such, is very hard to improve upon. DePalma did this by enlisting the aid of veteran Hitchcock film composer Bernard Herrmann, who also of course did the score for "Psycho". The opening title theme of "Psycho" is tense, jabbing, suggesting flight, but the opening title theme of "Sisters" is frightening, haunting, and taunting, "only" four notes (like the opening two phrases of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony) in a great "nyah nyah" motif, like a child's playground "you can't catch me!" taunt. It is heightened by the repeated gruesome medical slides of Siamese Twins in utero, shown as background to the credits. In the murder scene, DePalma goes several steps beyond Hitchcock's famous shower scene, by showing us the demonic, hate-filled, crazed face of murderess Dominique/Danielle, reminiscent of the Paul Klee painting, "A Girl Possessed", and of Linda Blair in the most advanced stages of possession in "The Exorcist". There is also a witness, neighbor and newspaper columnist Grace Collier, who sees the victim write "Help me" on the window in his own blood. We also see the knife going into the victim's groin. The surprise murder is "provoked" by the victim attempting to surprise Dominique/Danielle with a birthday cake. This is several quantum leaps of grue and shock beyond the shower scene in "Psycho".I also found the asylum patient who angrily declaims, "That's how I got so sick !", to probing reporter Grace, to be very frightening. In "Psycho", we hear Norman Bates talk about how horrific it is inside a madhouse, and that is scary enough, due to Perkins' marvelous acting, Herrmann's great music, and of course Hitchcock's great directing, but DePalma shows us the madhouse at length, and, in it, reporter Grace silenced, forced to be a patient, parts of her memory temporarily erased. To me, this was reminiscent of the scene in "Rosemary's Baby", in which Rosemary, having gone to Dr. Hill for help, is bullied into silence by Dr. Sapirstein, who threatens to have her committed to an insane asylum, if she says any more about witches or covens.I won't belabor the obvious parallels to "Psycho" in the opening "Peeping Tom" TV show, and closing bloody couch at the garbage dump.</fullReview>

Add to it the frightening Bernard Hermann score and I wound up having nightmares for days afterwards.

So sue me: he rips off Hitchcock right and left in this early film, but man does he do it right!Yeah sure, there are some really cheesy moments (the blood was a little too red acrylic paint for me and the "sister-reporter" was a little too After School Special-esque for my tastes) but man. The stuff that works, really works. And yes I am mostly talking about Herrmann's score! Man oh man. Taking the best cues from his Vertigo and Psycho scores and somehow coming up with a totally fresh, creepy new soundtrack for something that could have easily ended up in the exploitation dustbin. DePalma even gives props to Hermann in the DVD interview, giving credit where credit is due.A big surprise was Margot Kidder. After the hilarious opening scene (a nice nod to his Hi! Mom! fans)I totally forgot I was watching Lois Lane. At first I thought she was supposed to be of some Slavic descent, but then the French accent worked. And she was sexy!So I would say that you must see this movie for the Herrmann score and Margot Kidder. The dream sequence is prime DePalma cheese (it almost works if you can imagine yourself seeing it in a darkened Times Square theater on a cold late night)and some of the acting is a little....rushed. But man, the dude made it for the price of "Clerks" and the Criterion transfer is pristine.Two cleavers up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>De Palma's first venture into Hitchcockian territory is one of the most genuinely weird horror plots ever conceived. Some of his more obvious Hitchcock influences are in this one (Rear Window, Psycho), although they work well. A little raw, but still some excellent scenes - especially the dream sequence towards end. Interesting storyline, but some of the same themes would be handled much better with "Dressed to Kill" seven years later, when he had more experience, a bigger budget, and a better cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of De Palma's best Hitchcock homages!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: SPOLIERS AHEAD Not just of this film, but also of Hitchcock's PSYCHO!!!Brian De Palma wants to be Alfred Hitchcock. All of his thrillers are homages to the master, and SISTERS is one of his best. It is an intense film about a reporter who thinks she witnesses a murder in the apartment across the street. She calls the police, but when they can't find the body, they close the case. The reporter delves deeper into the story and finds some disturbing things. Margot Kidder plays the woman suspected of the murder. She has a demanding twin sister who gets mad whenever the nice sister brings a man home. The film is really well made, in the style of Hitchcock. The films conclusion, where it is revealed that the evil twin sister died years ago, and the nice twin has taken on both personalities brings to mind Hitch's PSYCHO, where Norman Bates has taken on the alter ego of his demanind mother. PSYCHO is not the only Hitchcock film used as base material here. REAR WINDOW is as well. It is a thrilling chiller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A charming foray into the world of castration anxiety, Sisters is at once highly inventive and highly derivative, and after an odd start takes off in some disturbing directions. It's not the most masterfully paced movie, but it truly comes alive in its setpieces, which are handled with a great deal of visual flair.Margot Kidder gives a serviceable performance as the mysterious model with a Dark Secret; Jennifer Salt comes across a lot better, as hers is a trickier part to play; and William Finley has a field day as Kidder's ex-husband, who is alternately disturbed and fascinated by his ex-wife's psychosis. But the true star of the movie is De Palma, nestling cozily within the confines of the genre to produce a more or less unique picture; audaciously switching to split-screen technique to increase tension (he would go back to this well again), and providing the film's reason for being in the form of a hallucinatory recreation of the traumatic separation of the titular sisters. Furthermore, as mentioned before, I've rarely ever seen a movie confronting male castration anxiety so directly; if it's all a little Freudian-in-primary-colors, it still has an impact entirely of its own.</fullReview>

Don't watch it alone though.....well, maybe you better watch it alone because you may never again be certain about the person your with after seeing this one.There is violence and gore in this movie but it is not excessive, in fact it is fairly mild by today's standards. The movie opens in a very low key manner but before you realize it, the suspense is gripping you completely. The scenes in the hospital are a visual treat and build powerfully to a dramatic finale. The only thing comparable that I've seen in other movies is in Hitchcock's work, in my opinion.This movie is out of print and hard to find. There are still good used copies around though and it's occasionally on TV. It's well worth the effort to try and see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prime DePalma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though this early DePalma horror film, combines elements of Hitchcock, Polanski and Felini, and features Cronenberg-like body horror and disgust, it works brilliantly on its own terms, and it's scarier, less pretentious, and more genuinely nightmarish than most of the over-produced films DePalma has made since. The mixture of comedy and horror works, and the split screen in a movie about a split personality is clever and effective, and both Margot Kidder and Jennifer Salt who were in DePalma's first feature Murder A La Mod(1968) have never been better. Jennifer Salt is Lois Lane crossed with Nancy Drew; nobody takes her seriously including her mother played by Mary Davenport who actually is Salt's mother, and Willian Finley, who was the Phantom of the Paradise, is the creepy mad doctor. Beginning with the title sequence with Bernard Hermann's wonderfully over-the-top score, Sisters is compelling and entertaining from start to finish and thanks to DePalma's directorial inventiveness it works on several levels. This is prime DePalma and a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A unpopular reporter, Grace Collier(Jennifer Salt), not well received for her portrayal of the New York police department among other things, sees the murder of a black man from across the way, watching the unfortunate victim write with his blood on the apartment window of Danielle(Margot Kidder), a French Canadian model..who just so happens to have been separated from a Siamese twin, Dominque. With help from the doctor/husband who separated her, Emil Breton(William Finley, who favors John Waters), they will hide the body in a couch, cleaning up the mess(..the murder and clean-up echo "Psycho")before the investigators, who Grace called on the phone, get there. Grace, not well liked for an article she published in her little newspaper on police brutality, is treated with scorn and told to muzzle herself when the detectives find no trace of any murder occurring. Motivated to find the body and convince the police a man was murdered in Danielle's apartment, and given clearance by her paper to pursue the matter(..regarding the murder of a black man and how the racist cops could give a damn), Grace will attempt to bring justice to an innocent's death. Grace's paper hires a gumshoe, who disguises himself as working-men, Joseph Larch(Charles Durning)who finds a way into Danielle's apartment, retrieving a file on Danielle and her twin Dominique..this will provide Grace with something to follow. Meanwhile, Larch will follow the couch containing the murdered man's corpse, so that real evidence can be used against whoever the murderer is.Having seen "Sisters" before, I could really admire the way director De Palma toys with the audience, using every little technique possible. He uses split-screen imaginatively during the moment our opening lead male, Phillip Woode(Lisle Wilson), has been stabbed multiple times, crawling to the window with Grace shell-shocked, during the clean-up as our reporter calls the police and attempting to get to Danielle's apartment as soon as she can. Ingenious methods show how Dominique rears her ugly head for the first time after Phillip knocks Danielle's pills into the sink drain before heading to the drug store and returning with a birthday cake. De Palma brilliantly sets up a scenario where it's a race against time for Emil and Danielle to finish ridding themselves of any evidence Phillip ever even set foot in the apartment, while the detectives and Grace close in. The journey of the couch and Larch also plays out magnificently after the harrowing climax when Dominque returns as Emil attempts to rid Danielle of her sister's "presence" once and for all. The hypnosis Emil uses on Grace is also a nifty little device De Palma applies as the detectives wish to find the body, believing her story after first thinking she was pulling their chain, and running across a mental block put in place where she couldn't tell them anything. Not only does De Palma's tale use the psychological terrain of what can occur, traumatically, when one Siamese twin loses another, but also how continuing down a road on your own, amateur sleuthing when told not to, can lead to dangerous circumstances leaving you emotionally scarred for life. I felt De Palma proves he's quite a story-teller, using his talents and influences to craft a very multi-layered and ultimately disturbing psychological terror tale. This film is often quite violent for Dominique is quite a knife-maniac, plunging and slicing anyone who threatens to "take Danielle away" from her. The scene where Larch enters Danielle's apartment, snooping for evidence, &amp; Grace's seeing the murder across the way both echo "Rear Window." Kidder is stunning as Danielle and terrifying as Dominique. Wilson's Phillip echoes Janet Leigh's Marion Crane from "Psycho" in that he's the male character we follow for quite a bit of the film's opening, getting to like him, understanding the kind of likable guy he was, only to see him die in a very unpleasant way. Finley, as always, is really creepy as Emil, an ex-husband who can not relinquish he love for Danielle no matter the threat Dominique is to his life. The B&amp;W sequence is quite enigmatic as we gaze into the past regarding Danielle and Dominique's time together before separation with Grace taking the latter's place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sisters ***1/2Sisters is a movie that becomes romantic, horrifying, and fascinating. DePalma doesn't waste any time with pointless plots. The only plot in this movie is what the movie is about, no strings attached. Even though the blood looks fake, the death scenes are very grim, even though only two people are murdered in the whole entire film. The first murder has to be the most cruelest. After the murder stabs the victim in the leg, she inserts the knife into the victims mouth and slides it out. He is bleeding out of the leg and the mouth and we can see the pieces of flesh hanging out from it. It's a classic death scene. Another fascinating thing is that the movie only feels it's an hour long but that also may be a flaw. The twist in the end however feels fake. The reason is that DePalma doesn't feel the twist is important enough to string a dramatic scene like in Oldboy, of course this maybe an understatement even though Sisters was made first. However the movie is good and it doesn't fail to fascinate</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must profess that I am not Brian DePalma's biggest admirer. I think "Body Double" (1984) shows that he take take all his creative drive and drive over the cliff in it. He also tends to be so influenced by Hitchcock that the cries of creative plagirism seem quite valid at times, most notably in "Dressed to Kill" (1980) and "Blow Out" (1981). But, even when he is not on top of his game, he makes some very interesting films like his most recent effort "Femme Fatale" (2002). This is one of DePalma's best films, along with his two most underated "Carlito's Way" and "Casualties of War" and the likes of "Carrie" and "The Untouchables." "Sisters" is sophisticated, intellectually challenging, stylish and very unpredicatable. It reminds me too much of "Rear Window" at some instances and the acting, with the excpetion of the lead Margot Kidder, is credible, but not as good as it could have perhaps been. Bernard Herrman's score, as was the case in "Psycho" and "Taxi Driver" is stirring to say the least! Worth a look, especially if you are a DePalma fan. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock homage or rip-off?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a certain extent of how much influence can one director draw from his icon, and Brian De Palma seems to stretch that extent to its very limits with "Sisters". This, along with "Dressed to Kill" are the American film maker's most Hitchcok-ian films, and a double feature screening is much suggested for a complete experience. Perhaps lacking the later films sexual emphasis (but of course not lacking sexual themes entirely-typically for De Palma) this film borderlines horror exploitation, but only in the best of ways.The visual style is top notch, as split screen narratives serve the suspense in an excellent way and drive the story forward keeping a fast pace, saving on screen time. However, as usually commented on De Palma's work, one can truly argue that this stylization is utilized to cover up the lack of a strong story. Talking about the story, it borrows (and that is a very weak word...) elements from classic Hitchcock films, notably Rear Window. There is an abundance of clichés, which, although performed perfectly, are still, nevertheless clichés. To be honest, once you've seen psycho, this movie and its "sister feature" (no pun intended), Dressed to Kill, lose a lot of what appreciation they could have earned from the viewer.With that being said, "Sisters" is a very entertaining movie, mainly because of its visual style and tricks, which will satisfy fans of the director but disappoint viewers looking for an original story or plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting early effort from a soon-to-be master thriller director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sisters" was made before de Palma found his feet as a suspense director, though it still has Hitchcockian touches we know to expect, ie. a supposed "main" character being offed early on and the focus moving to another, and the disintegration of all our assumptions at the beginning to make us question what we've seen and end with a big question mark.This is actually more a horror movie than a typical thriller. Like "Carrie" there is some really shocking graphic violence, horror effects, and a plot that involves elements of science fiction. We are not expected to believe what we see; in fact we wind up being made to question everything.The plot is something to do with conjoined sisters who were separated and left in a state of precarious sanity. A man is killed and a woman witnesses the act - or did she? We are led to believe that the separated psycho twin may have performed the murder, but does she even exist?This is a good horror/thriller, but I found my attention waiving a bit toward the end, right when the revelations are coming. I think something like this requires smarter editing and staging, which Hitchcock was a master of but de Palma had yet to master.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brian De Palma's first thriller shows very clearly his love for the genre. It is inventively and assuredly directed, with masterful (and playful) use of the split screen (notice how this filmic device starts off by showing events that happen in two different buildings, later it moves on to events that happen in the same building, and finally one and the same event is shown from two opposite sides!), and features one of Bernard Herrmann greatest (and most otherworldly) scores, as well as a supremely creepy performance by William Finley, and a shocking murder sequence. De Palma's story is not up to the level of his direction - the central twist is pretty obvious. But "Sisters" is more about the visuals than the story anyway; case in point, the inexplicable but amusing final shot. **1/2 out of 4.</fullReview>

I figured it out early and for my liking way too soon. Still the movie remained interesting. The characters were certainly well played and thought out. I was impressed by the split-screen sequences, something you don't see that often mostly when people telephone but in this it was different actions and made more interesting. Also the flashbacks in black and white which looked like a documentary were done really well. Weak points for me were the really fake blood on the victims plus how the story itself was executed wasn't that interesting. However I don't know how else they should have done it. The role of the detective was in my opinion not really a plus to the movie. The real creep for me was the doctor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kick-starts a fine decade for Brian De Palma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After over a decade of shorts and forgotten comedies, director Brian De Palma finally embraced his Alfred Hitchcock fixation and made Sisters, kick-starting a second decade of movies that any director would be proud of. Inspired by an article on Siamese twins in the Soviet Union, Sisters begins with a weird game show where the audience and contestants guess on the outcome of prank situation involving a slowly undressing blind woman and a potential peeping tom. The blind woman turns out to be an actress, Danielle (Margot Kidder), who isn't really blind, and she offers a nightcap to the peeper (who turned out not to peep after all), Phillip (Lisle Wilson).They spend the night together and in the morning, discovering it's Danielle's (and her twin sister Dominique's) birthday, he heads out to a bakery to buy her a cake. On his return, he finds Danielle in a strange state, and she stabs him repeatedly with a knife. In the adjacent window, Grace (Jennifer Salt), witnesses the murder and immediately calls the police. But as she's a reporter who has recently disgruntled the police with a damaging news story, they procrastinate with questions, allowing Danielle and her ex-husband Emil (Phantom of the Paradise's (1974) William Finley) time to hide the body and clean up the murder scene. Grace, frustrated, is joined by private investigator Joseph Larch (Charles Durning), who starts the search for the elusive corpse as Grace probes into Danielle's alarming past.Although heavy on the Hitchcockian touches - the references to Rear Window (1954) and Psycho (1960) are obvious - Sisters has a life of his own. The macabre climax especially, as distorted, implanted memories play out like an absurdist silent horror directed by the Maysles brothers, is visually stunning. Although exploitation tactics are used during the bloodier scenes, the film is heavily psychological. For most of the duration of the film, it's unclear as to what it's really about, but this uncertainty only makes the film more intriguing. It's capped off with a fine performance from Kidder (playing both twins) and a reliably creepy turn from Finley, who is possibly the strangest looking man I've ever seen.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>7.0 is quite a measly score on IMDb, for such a good Brian de Palma film and as for a debut, well, it's intelligent, suspenseful and different, though its nods to the Master, Hitchcock are both critically recognised and acclaimed.Also known as 'Blood Sisters', the movie also encroaches (to my mind) on David Cronenberg's territory, especially during the superbly executed and creepy fantasy sequence. It'll have you guessing right to the end - and beyond, it has red herrings and both clarity and obliqueness in spades.Yes, it does look typically 1970's US crime drama, the fashion and the gas guzzling cars but it remains extremely watchable, now, almost 40 years on. What is also quite remarkable is that De Palma co-wrote the screenplay and the story is an involved one and rather unsettlingly, an almost believable one. That cannot be said for the vast majority of crime horror-thrillers.Quebec actress/model Danielle (or should that be Dominique? her conjoined sister, who was surgically separated at the hip from her Siamese Twin), has a one-night stand with a black man she meets. In true 'Rear Window' fashion, an ambitious journalist, (played by Jennifer Salt) who's had reason to write unfavourable pieces about the police, dials 911, after the victim staggers to a window opposite hers and scrawls 'help' in blood on the glass.There's always a shadowy and creepy character hanging about. Dominique (Danielle?) always states that he's her ex husband but we soon find out that Emil Breton (Bill Finley) is actually the very surgeon who carried out the separation. Nothing much more needs to be said on this, or any other part of the story, to not spoil or give too much away. However, smarmy, thick spectacled Mr Breton has an uncanny resemblance to Donald Sutherland, or at least the type of individual he might portray.There's De Palma's splashes of flashy, but interesting direction, such as a very effective split screens. There's the right amount of suspense and whilst it doesn't reach the heights of the classic Carrie, nor the sheer directorial aplomb of his The Untouchables, 'Sisters' is a pretty fine film and at the now bargain price the DVD is, there are no excuses for De Palma fans, or even Hitch's, indeed anyone who enjoys a decent and clever horror-thriller to not indulge.This was my second viewing; the first having been on TV a long time ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brian De Palma's early work shows a great deal of homage to Alfred Hitchcock and perhaps nowhere can that be seen better than in Sisters. A beautiful young French-Canadien Margot Kidder has an evening of passion with Lisle Wilson, an African-American she met as a model/actress on a show called "Peeping Toms" where unsuspecting people are caught peeping on what they would not want to be caught peeping on. By the way the recreation of the game show to mirror the idiocy of game shows at that time was right on the mark - even to the point of the audience. I digress; however. Kidder brings this young man home, sleeps with him, and then sends him out for pills. He comes back with the medicine and a birthday cake for Danielle(Kidder)and her twin sister who is sleeping in the other room, Dominique. Wilson brings the cake to the sleeping Kidder on the roll-away couch along with a huge knife Kidder had won in the game show. Well, she takes the knife and carves up Wilson. The murder is graphically portrayed and is seen by Grace Collier(Jennifer Salt) from across the street. Collier calls the police and waits, meanwhile Kidder's husband Emile(William Finley) comes in and cleans the mess. The rest of the film shows Collier try and prove she saw a murder after the police find nothing. Sisters is really rather good as the tension builds throughout very much like what one would see in a Hitchcock movie. The camera angles at times are just likes Hitch's. The mulligans are there too, and the music is even scored by Hitcock regular Bernard Herrmann. Herrmann's score is reminiscent of Psycho and so to some degree is the plot(along with threads from Rear Window as well as others). But who cares? De Palma does a very good job making an effective thriller and keeping the suspense alive. The acting is good overall. Kidder does a fine job with a French accent and is so very appealing to the eye. Salt is adequate, but the likes of Charles Durning as a detective, Barnard Hughes as a reporter, Dolph Sweet as a crusty cop, Mary Davenport a Collier's mom(as well as Salt's mom in real life), and even a brief cameo of Olympia Dukakis as a bakery person all add amazing credibility to the tale told. and watch for William Finley's bizarre performance as Emile, Danielle's husband and a bearer of secrets himself. Finley is an actor I wish had done more film work other than just De Palma's projects, because he is able to convey a lot of different emotions in a most weird, eccentric, and quirky way. The movie is an above-average thriller for two-thirds of the movie but then comes a most bizarre and unique dream sequence brought on by drugs in which both Kidder and Salt go through some heavy hallucinations and the whole cast gets to take part in. It is filmed in stark black and white with a hazy feel and transcends this film from the ordinary thriller to a psychological horror film. I never saw anything like it in a Hitchcock film.</fullReview>

The blood was fake looking, but the creepy music playing during the murder seemed to make up for it. I was glued at this point and really drawn into the role played fabulously by Margot Kidder. Jennifer Salt's role was overly drawn out and the movie seemed to center more around her than anyone else. Her "investigation" grated on my nerves and I kept wishing she would get to the end of it. The plot had a few holes in it, but the ending was surprising and a little creepy. It's too bad you could sort of figure out the ending ahead of time but overall, this movie was enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revolutionary filming-techniques. Haunting murder sequence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story about schizophrenia and voyeurism unfolds as we watch Margot Kidder trying to establish whether or not she saw a murder. Remeniscent of Hitchcock's Rear Window and Psycho, some consider this to be plagiarism, others consider it to be an ode. The ambiguity in the story is to be admired, and the split-screen technique (which is of course related to the duality-element) is very revolutionary as well as effective. The plot isn't completely flawless, and some scenes are admittedly dragged out, but watch for the excellent murder-scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! When I saw this movie I was immediately under the impression that it was not to be taken seriously, I mean a french-canadian supermodel/actress the killer???? This impression was quickly shattered when Margot kidder grabs the knife to cut her birthday cake! Pretty much the only scene of violence in the film, but it was effective. Depalma plays with the characters here so you are torn between Kidder and her nosey next door neighbor...personally I found it difficult to NOT root for Kidder.DePalma's camera work in the beginning (when Kidder is being questioned by police and her husband/doctor is disposing of evidence) is phenomenal....just a hint of what he could do for Carrie. Though the split screens may be a tad bit confusing to some, I guarantee that If you are paying the least bit of attention you'll understand what is going on.The story was great, it's been done before and since, but this is a pretty neat take on it. The footage from the hospital where Dominique and Danielle were separated is creepy.The only drawback is the silly twist ending, not quite fitting with the rest of the film.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Sister Has a Problem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>She's so darn seductive, what guy could resist her. But resist Margot Kidder they better, because she's got an evil twin that reacts very badly toward sex. If you can get past all the gore and the unmistakable shadow of Hitchcock, this is one heck of a fascinating film, with an excellent script, a number of twists, and some well-realized irony. And pity poor reporter Jennifer Salt. She wants so badly to do the right thing, but she's got a nagging mother, a detective school helper, and a tactless attitude. Now she's on the trail of a hot story, one that might land her a big-time job, but she really doesn't know what she's dealing with. There are several memorable scenes-- the "surprise" birthday party, Salt's wacky nightmare (very Fellini-esquire), and the final bedside irony, along with a nicely deceptive opening that sets the stage for what follows.De Palma has had a maddening career as a movie-maker. All in all, Sisters is probably the best and worst thing to happen to him. It's his best movie, done with flash and assurance, but it also propels him down the wrong-way track of re-doing Hitchcock without the master's knowing restraint. The result is an erratic career and a general squandering of real talent. Too bad, because the very last scene suggests a delicious irony worthy of the master himself. And that, of course, is the problem. But it's no problem for this film, which stands as a minor gem in the horror-suspense category.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A gruesome story about the separation of Siamese twins, where the surviving sister tries to live her own life, but carries the dangerous personality of her other half, which emerges if she doesn't take her medication. The ending in a dark sanitarium is sufficiently atmospheric, and Margot Kidder does a good job as the tormented surviving twin, playing a model who tries to live a normal life, at one point bringing a man she met at a bar home, with the other sister awakening the next morning. It's shot on New York's Staten Island, which makes for interesting non-descript locations, a bizarre bakery scene, and an ironic ending shot as the closing credits roll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Palma's first masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is so much to appreciate in this early De Palma film.Let me start with the actors - Margot Kidder (that pout!) and William Finley (the man with the sinister face) not only look remarkable, but exude sensuality and danger. The plainly pretty and earnest Jennifer Salt is a perfect foil for the sultry Kidder. Charles Durning and some other bit players like the actress who played Salt's mother and the two bakery employees add muscle to the ensemble.The almost hilariously bombastic score by Bernard Herrmann is perfect for this genre flick. It does have a melancholic tune which is played while Kidder and her boyfriend are on a ferry.The set pieces are something else. Like the white corporate cleanliness of Danielle's flat which forms the backdrop for the close up of the two red pills. Split screens, extensive use of close ups (like the one of Danielle's eyes - maybe a nod to Vertigo's title sequence) and dream sequences add to the film's visual splendor.De Palma satirized American society in his earlier films like Greetings, Hi Mom and Get to Know Your Rabbit. Jennifer Salt's amusing exchanges with the cops and her naked ambition as a reporter is De Palma's commentary on the American media and police force.Sisters is probably the first De Palma masterpiece.

		<shortDescription>De Palma's style-defining piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young French-Canadian model and would-be actress Danielle Breton (Kidder) in New York City, meets cute with a black advertising salesman Philip Woode (Wilson), in a proto-reality show "Peeping Tom", which conspicuously heralds director Brian De Palma's intrigue of voyeurism in this lurid genre piece: the urge of killing from a Siamese twin under severe psychological pressure and personality disorder, who has been recently successfully severed from her sister.Yes, Danielle has a twin sister Dominique, De Palma and co-writer Louisa Rose's script doesn't shy away from steadily implicating that Dominique is the insidious killer who lurks behind the camera, initiates conversations with the personable Danielle, and mercilessly assaults any man who gets intimate with her lovable sister, an emblem of the evil side of the conjoined anomaly, meantime, a bespectacled, bulged-eyed, gangling Emil Breton (Finley), Danielle's ex-husband, looks equally suspicious and sinister with his hidden agenda.Philip is the jinxed victim who thinks he is getting lucky, but fails to notice that he overstays his welcome due to his own goodwill, how ironic is that? Before succumbing to death, however clumsily, at least he manages to catch the attraction of Grace Collier (Salt), the journalist living in the building across Danielle's apartment, immediately she alerts the police force, but as outlined by the split screen dynamically chronicling the paralleled actions, contrasting the crime scene where Danielle and Emil hastily conceal the dead body (thanks for ruining couch bed for me Mr. De Palma) and clean up the blood, with the detectives dilly-dally their action (racism and sexism are heedfully hinted here) to check Danielle's apartment against Grace's mounting keenness and impatience. What De Palma devises is a stylish and effective cinematic machination, but he also wears his heart on his sleeve, which inconveniently renders the not-so-convoluted story an unwelcome feeling of arbitrariness.Grace, hogs the limelight thereafter, vigilantly plays detective, digs into the backstories of Danielle and hopes for an exposé, thanks to the assistance of a private eye Joseph Larch (Durning), who will later undertake a tailing mission to a bizarre and goofy cul-de-sac (and literally, the ending of the film). Grace is characterised as an uncouth, career-pursuing knucklehead, we understand that she is a woman of principle, works hard to break the glass ceiling, but her undisguised single- mindedness and wanting for etiquette turn herself into an irritant, consequently pare down viewers' investment into her dangerous pursuit, which ends up in a mental hospital, where Emil finally gives his tell-all recount and discloses the darkest secret of Danielle, while Grace's own sanity will be forever compromised by Emil's hypnotic brainwash. Undeniably, this part is the meat of the story, it is presented from a peculiar angle of an eyeball, with a surreal veneer onto the sensational tale-of-misery by its grotesque tableaux vivants and freaky colour scheme, yet, for my money, Bernard Herrmann's intrusive score is a shade shrill and nerve-racking.Margot Kidder deserves some kudos for her dualistic impersonation and nails a not-so-irritating French accent, to corroborate her undervalued versatility. It would also turn out to be a wonderful idea for Jennifer Salt to give up acting and become a successful TV producer and writer instead. On the first impression, SISTERS is a testimony of De Palma's forte: injecting a dash of gore into a deeply unsettling psycho-drama, but that doesn't make him an essential master, because a certain requirement of gravitas and punctiliousness is something uniformly absent from most of his works I have watched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy minor masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inspired by a 1966 'Time' magazine article on Siamese twins who had divergent personalities, Brian De Palma wrote a script that combined elements from several Alfred Hitchcock films, particularly 'Rear Window' and 'Psycho'. De Palma even hired Hitchcock's music composer, Bernard Hermann, to write the score. Though certainly an unabashed homage to the Master of Suspense, 'Sisters' is not a Hitchcock rip-off. Margot Kidder plays Danielle, a French-Canadian beauty separated from her Siamese twin, Dominique (also played by Kidder) by surgeon Emil Breton (William Finley). Some time after the surgery Danielle becomes Madame Breton but the marriage soon founders. Moving from Quebec to New York City to pursue an acting/modeling career?and pursued by a jealous, stalking Dr. Breton?Danielle appears on a weirdly voyeuristic game show called 'Peeping Toms' (no doubt in homage to Michael Powell's 1960 classic horror-thriller). Also on the show is Phillip Woode (Lisle Wilson), an attractive young black man who wins dinner-for-two at the Africa Room, a Manhattan theme restaurant. He asks Danielle to join him and, after an agreeable evening, the two repair to Danielle's apartment, despite the fact that Emil is lurking nearby. To his surprise Phillip discovers that Danielle has a twin sister and that it is their birthday. When he initiates foreplay, Dominique (or is it Danielle?) reacts in sex-phobic horror and stabs him to death ? la 'Psycho' (or, better yet, Roman Polanski's 'Repulsion'). Emil arrives on the scene and helps Danielle clean up and dispose of the body in her convertible sofa! Now the 'Rear Window' plot presaged by Peeping Toms, kicks in. Grace Collier (Jennifer Salt), a reporter, witnesses the murder from her window in the adjacent building and calls the police. The cops search Danielle's apartment but find no evidence of a killing. Vowing to solve the crime, Grace hires Joseph Larch (Charles Durning), a private investigator, to help her. Suffice to say that the proceedings get weirder from then on and that the ending is both surprising and brilliant. Despite the dubious efficacy of Margot Kidder's French accent, 'Sisters' boasts an intriguing script, tight direction, fine performances, and Bernard Hermann's suitably chilling score. It is not only Brian De Palma's first distinctive effort it is probably his best film, certainly the most underrated. VHS (2000); Criterion Collection DVD (2000).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little bit uneven but with some standout moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sisters is the first Hitchcock influenced thriller that Brian De Palma directed. He has subsequently famously been described as a Hitchcock copyist. While he certainly has taken a lot of influence from the great man, I think it's unfair that he is so often derided for this. For me, he simply takes a few ideas from Hitchcock and updates and twists them into his own. And he sure isn't the first to do this. De Palma certainly has his own style and Sisters quite clearly demonstrates it. In this particular example he takes elements of Rear Window and Psycho as the basis for a psychological thriller with slasher elements. Because this was a very early De Palma film he was still working on quite a low budget, so Sisters is definitely a movie that is consequently a little rough around the edges. But despite this the direction has considerable invention and visual flair in places and it's this reason above all others that makes this one interesting.It opens somewhat improbably like a comedy, where we are thrust into the middle of a ludicrous game-show called Peeping Toms. From here the principal characters meet and the thriller narrative begins, which boils down to a woman believing she has witnessed a murder in the flat opposite hers, her investigations lead her to learn about a strange case of two disturbed Siamese twin sisters.The story and dialogue is often a bit clunky if truth be told. But if you can get past this there are some very worthwhile things about this. Firstly, the opening murder is extremely effective indeed. It's actually pretty scary and brutal. And I still get a bit of a jolt when I see it, even when I know it's coming, which is a pretty nifty trick it has to be said. Furthermore, De Palma gets to express his customary technical excellence in cinematic style. And when he does it really elevates the quality of Sisters. There is excellent use of split-screen that is not gimmicky but very effective in relaying a lot of information simultaneously and adding to the suspense. These moments are used in the immediate aftermath of the murder and allow us to be with the villains and the witness. Great stuff. Later on De Palma is allowed to go for it again with an extensive flash-back/dream-sequence which was also very well executed. Throughout all of this there is the very distinctive music of Hitchcock collaborator Bernard Herrmann on the soundtrack and that certainly helped add additional value.I wouldn't put this as amongst De Palma's best offerings though, as its great moments were interspersed with quite a lot of quite mediocre ones. He revisited this type of film later on to much greater effect with Dressed to Kill (1980). But, that said, this is still a film that showcases some of the techniques and influences he would go on to be famous for. And it is a film with great individual moments that's for sure.</fullReview>

Don't get me wrong, it is well made, but all in all I was disappointed with the film. The finale is exciting, but rather than scaring me it had my head spinning and I was like, "What the heck is going on here?". Margot Kidder is very pretty and does a fine job, as do all the other actors. Personally, I like "Carrie" and "Dressed to Kill" much better, but "Sisters" is still a pretty good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes interesting homage to Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With "Sisters", director Brian De Palma really showed how influenced he was by Alfred Hitchcock. In the movie, I saw elements of such Hitchcock movies as "Rope", "Rear Window", "North By Northwest", and "Psycho". In some ways, these homages kind of spoil the movie; even if you just have a casual knowledge of Hitchcock, more likely than not you will be able to guess one of the movie's "surprise" revelations. To De Palma's credit, he does throw in some original touches along the way (like one segment done in a split screen process), as well as some effective low key humor that the Master probably would have approved of. However, things do start to fall apart in the last fifteen minutes or so, leading to an ending that I was not sure that I understood completely. But before that last segment, the movie does deliver seventy five minutes or so of a fairly compelling story, so it does earn a marginal recommendation whether you are into Hitchcock-like thrillers or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh Sister, Where Art Thou?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer/director Brian De Palma is most acclaimed for his - admittedly brilliant - epic gangster movies from the 80's and 90's ("Scarface", "The Untouchables", "Carlito's Way"), but personally I'm a much bigger fan of his imaginative, raw and often very flamboyant horror outings of the 1970's. "Carrie" is an obvious favorite, but so are the "The Fury", "Murder ? la Mod" and the oddly stupendous but still criminally underrated "Phantom of the Paradise". And also "Sisters" is a very worthwhile and entertaining motion picture from the period De Palma was still a struggling young filmmaker. Particularly the first half hour is a crude and shocking psycho-thriller that once again showcases the director's blatant obsession of Alfred Hitchcock, while the rest of the film is more of an experimental paranoia/medical horror (although Hitchcock's influence is clearly present here as well). The Canadian actress/model Danielle, on the run for her stalking ex-husband, meets the gentle Philip during a crazy TV-show entitled "Peeping Tom" and invites him to her Staten Island apartment for a passionate night. The next morning, however, Philip discovers that Danielle has a twin sister named Dominique, and she isn't nearly as hospitable or charming. From her apartment across the street, the ambitious journalist Grace Collier witnesses how Philip is brutally murdered, but by the time the police arrives, all the evidence has disappeared and they don't believe her story. Grace starts her own private investigation, which unravels disturbing secrets about Danielle, Dominique and ex-husband Emil. Since the background of the twin sisters is rather predictable, even if you haven't read or heard anything about the plot from beforehand, the whole second and final act of "Sisters" isn't too suspenseful or surprising. De Palma attempts to compensate for this by inserting grotesque surgical horror, black humor and an ambiguous open ending. Speaking in terms of style, our director effectively uses cool split-screen and excessive gross-out gore during the murder sequence and flashbacks. De Palma could also rely on a downright terrific score by Bernard Herrmann and stellar performances from Margot Kidder, Jennifer Salt and particularly William Finley as eerie husband/surgeon. His character reminded me of a sinister Nazi doctor or even a cold war spy, and his hypnosis sequence is genuinely uncanny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rear Window to Psycho</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Staten Island model Margot Kidder (as Danielle Breton) takes a job posing as a blind woman undressing for viewers of a New York-based TV game show. A French-Canadian also hoping to be an actress, she begins to disrobe for advertising manager Lisle Wilson (as Phillip "Phil" Woode). Contestants must determine if Mr. Wilson will "Stop?Look?Listen," "Silence Is Golden," or "This Way Out." Nobody bothers to explain those options. This turns out to be par for the course of the film. After the game, Ms. Kidder flirts with Wilson. After dinner, she takes him to her apartment for a roll on the couch...Kidder also brings home her prize from the TV appearance, a box of cutlery, which comes in handy. While those two play-act Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho" (1960), young investigative reporter Jennifer Salt (as Grace Collier) observes from another apartment a la the legendary director's "Rear Window" (1954). She thinks she sees a murder. There is no way Ms. Salt could have seen anything she describes, and she appears fairly calm before briefly seeing a hand and calling the police..."I saw the knife, I saw her stab him!" is not supported by any on screen action. Despite an unexplained shadowy female calling out for "Danielle" in the bathroom and an impossibly positioned blood-stain, director Brian De Palma does well in Kidder's apartment. Veteran composer Bernard Herrmann contributes a dead-on score. A marvelously creepy William "Bill" Finley is the best supporting actor. Others hitting character roles skillfully are policeman Dolph Sweet (as Kelly), private investigator Charles Durning (as Joseph Larch), "Siamese Twins" expert Barnard Hughes (as Arthur McLennen) and concerned mother Mary Davenport. Seventies slasher fans should give "Sisters" a shot.******* Sisters (3/27/73) Brian De Palma ~ Margot Kidder, Jennifer Salt, William Finley, Lisle Wilson</fullReview>

After finishing their work, they go to a bar wherein they encounter another man who claims to be the husband of the woman. Ditching that man, they get back to the woman's house to make love. Things start to go terribly wrong in the morning for the black guy and this is noticed by a woman who lives in a flat opposite to the one he is visiting. She calls the police and the "fun" begins.With a level of suspense and intrigue equal to and at times more than the better known and somewhat similar Rear Window, this is nearly up to its end, an unforgettable viewing experience. The screenplay is gripping.The split screens used by De Palma must have been revolutionary at the time and are still not dated. For me, the end was somewhat of a let-down with echoes of a very famous film which I would not name. But still, thriller lovers have to check this out. 3.5 out of 5 for De Palma's Sisters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Multiply-split reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DePalma is a clever guy who stops just short of great insights, usually does. The problem is that he prefers a solid base in other movies, so rarely has to puzzle about foundations in his work.But because you can spot this bit from Psycho and that bit from Rear Window, a lot of viewers seem to think he's merely a committed handyman whose job is to retouch bits and pieces of popular imagination. It ain't so, generally speaking. DePalma is all about interesting placement in the world of the camera. Only Blowout downright fails because he trivializes from the work of a master. All his other thrillers are worth watching, Snake Eyes being the most inconspicuously successful of them. Even his sci-fi works.This is an interesting take from his early days. It's all about multiply-split reality and the eye having to decide authorship of the story in each new split, but each new split undermines having seen. You get to decide, so feminists will read sexual abuse and so forth. So TV characters into reality, the crime and doing a story about it, twin opposite sisters one of them split off, and split the two of them together again into hallucinated memory. (The trick with split-screen plays off of this, swapping stories between cameras).You should know that this is a film from that time when young American filmmakers and actors would get together at nights in beach-houses and pass around spliffs as they contemplated ways to undermine what they saw as the false reality of old Hollywood and Nixon's America. Coppola did The Conversation. Scorsese found a kindred outsider soul in Schrader.Margot Kidder was one of those actresses in that circle and her story is eerily foreshadowed here. Coming of age in those years must have been a bit like having an acid tab slowly dissolve in your head anyway.So there is this sense of undermined/concave reality hanging over the film. The last split occurs inside the heroine, the journalist who writes the stories exposing wrongs in the state apparatus.But here's where DePalma's limitations kick into effect. The film's apparatus is designed to have a solid base. The pattern is signaled in just the first scene. We cut back to this being a TV show about it. The hallucination is its own mini-film, distinguished by 16mm and ostentatious posing. This is too bad, because there are several cutoff points that could be used as anchors (two of them before we even get to the murder, following sex and when he's buying cake and she wakes up on the floor).Since then we've had Lynch, who can bleed these things into the environment and sustain longdreaming flows from them. We are never really unsure here. It's a good film but we are never hypnotized to have false memories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early De Palma film; not his best but stylish and entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: ***1/2 out of 4.SISTERS isn't Brian De Palma's first film, but it might as well be called that because this is the first film where we got acquainted with his real tastes and his all-time admiration to the works of Alfred Hitchcock. It also introduced us to his love for split-screen techniques, long takes, over-the-top and dark humor, and violence. Although this is a lower-budget film than his later efforts, SISTERS shows what De Palma is truly capable of as a stylish visual storyteller. It's not his best work, but it's quality De Palma.The story is a bit strange, rather implausible, but in the end it doesn't matter. Some of De Palma's Hitchcockian thrillers are usually divorced from reality anyway, and rely solely on his skills as an excellent director and storyteller to grab the audience. It works, albeit not for everyone, which is why De Palma gets such a bad rap. While it's true that his later works were either works of a hired hand (his later films were Hollywood blockbusters) or works of someone who further alienates himself from his critics (FEMME FATALE is a quintessential De Palma film, suffice to say critics hated it), De Palma remains a natural born filmmaker who still believes in the real role of a director in a film, which is why most of his movies are "Director's movies".SISTERS has this quality, especially the visual style which is just impressive. The use of split-screen is rather primitive here (it would be put to greater use later), but De Palma is already getting the hang of the technique and knowing what to do with it. The scene where it is used, two suspects trying to cover up for a fresh murder before the police arrive, is captured perfectly as two separate events simultaneously occurring. The humor too is there. In the opening scenes, De Palma sends up the era's racial discrimination by having a black contestant in a game show receiving a free dining pass to the "African Room." It's little sequences like these that De Palma would use in later films. There's also, of course, the set-piece murder scene sprinkled with some semi-sadistic black humor amongst the carnage. Above all, the standout of theme of SISTERS is what De Palma would keep on using in his later films: The study of characters as voyeurs. There's also the use of the plot about voyeurism here since most of the characters are always looking, sometimes at things they are not meant to see. He even shamelessly borrows from Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW in one sequence, and successfully repeats Hitchcock's way of manipulation to keep audiences' palms sweating. There are a lot of Hitchcock allusions here (of course). Basically, the plot is PSYCHO by way of REAR WINDOW, with the use of doubles (another recurring De Palma motif) as in VERTIGO. The great Bernard Herrmann provides an odd yet superb score, sort of a medley of his VERTIGO and PSYCHO score and some of the cues from his THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL score. Overall, fans of De Palma will love this and I doubt that they haven't seen this gem. Despite the low budget and the occasionally dated moments, SISTERS is a great Hitchcockian thriller in pure De Palma fashion. I've only been into De Palma's works recently and already I'm hooked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will have to start off by stating that I do like Brian DePalma. While he does have a reputation as a sort of hack (due to his repeated abrasive homage to Alfred Hitchcock), I will say that he is definitely one talented filmmaker, and while I haven't seen all of his filmography, I have really enjoyed what I have seen, even if a lot of his stuff is very 'hit and miss.' The first half of his career is excellent, while the second pales in comparison (The Black Dahlia, anyone?), but even so, DePalma has certainly impressed me, even if he has constantly been criticised for being an emulator of certain styles, rather than actually creating his own.And now begins my review of Sisters, which I will have to say is perhaps DePalma's greatest achievement. Made on a shoestring budget in the days before DePalma made his mainstream splash with Carrie and made Sissy Spacek a household name, Margot Kidder (one year shy of the release of the classic Black Christmas) plays a young woman who becomes the subject of a criminal investigation after a young man is brutally murdered in her apartment. That sequence alone is one of the most shocking opening murder sequences you'll ever see?it is gritty as well as disturbing, but nevertheless, stunning in its visuals and its blunt monstrosity. So there we have it: a man is missing, and (in typical Hitchcockian fashion that has made DePalma so reviled by dozens of critics), there is no body, despite the fact that a news reporter (Jennifer Salt) who lives in the apartment across has seen the event.The strangest thing about it all is that Danielle Breton, the woman in question claims that her identical twin is in town?but where is this other woman? And so, Salt's determined Grace Collier embarks on her own investigation free from the questions and berating of the inept police department.What she discovers is at once shocking and disturbing as well as melancholy and terrific. The way DePalma creates suspense is masterful. It makes for one interesting as well as entertaining picture.The sense of tension is practically startling and the central performances, especially tailored and tortured, make the film. Salt exudes the confidence of a baby bird emerging from its egg and glancing upward at the glaring sunlight for the first time. This works perfectly, for it is her unease that lends to the film's sense of realism in the situations depicted, at least before the final act does its 180 flip. It is Salt's performance that serves to ground the film: before the film begins to veer off into very 'What the hell was that?' territory, she helps to remind us that she is still sane and that most importantly, we are. Once the film officially lets go of all of its pretenses, Salt (and us too!) can do nothing but embrace the madness before us.As for Margot Kidder? Well, she's nothing short of superb! It's a shame that her career nosedived after the late 1970s, though it is nice to see that she works steadily, even if many of her projects are beneath an actress of her calibre. Her performance as Danielle/Dominique ranks as one of the best you'll ever see in a horror film. At once smoldering in her delicacy and frightening in her playing of the stoic, calculating murderess, she is at her best in dark, nasty, gritty fare such as this.Though riddled with some plot holes (as well as an ending which comes across as disjointed and confusing), Sisters is a triumph?excellent and memorable, it marked the beginning of Brian DePalma's ascension into Hollywood glory. I wish that more films could be made like this one; especially when paired with performances as powerful as the ones here, for it would do the horror genre a great service.This one is a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SISTERS (Brian De Palma, 1973) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brian De Palma's SISTERS is another one I have watched for the first time. The film is highly regarded by many and, while I thought it was generally well made and enjoyable, I consider it somewhat overrated.The voyeuristic 'trick' opening is a curiously appropriate taster for what's to come, as we soon realize that we cannot trust anybody and nothing is what it seems. What the film has going for it, principally, is one hell of a build-up to a very bloody murder sequence: effective cross-cutting and notable use of the 'split-screen' technique create exquisite suspense, beautifully punctuated by Bernard Herrmann's insistent and chilling score. Apart from this, we occasionally get some wonderfully surrealistic touches like Jennifer Salt's drug-induced hallucination where she finds herself to be more closely bonded to Margot Kidder's character than she cares to admit, and the ironic final shot in which a cow moseys up nonchalantly to the all-important and incriminating couch (the whole scene overlooked by the inept but dogged private detective played by Charles Durning).On the other side of the spectrum, we get a rather slight plot for such a tall tale - somehow I expected there to be more than just one murder! Still, nothing that follows this amazing sequence can quite match up to it! Performances are just adequate, in my opinion: not bad obviously but not really outstanding either (certainly none had yet made any major films, and it shows). De Palma has always been written off as a 'rip-off' director ? particularly of Hitchcock's ? and that all started with this film. As I have said, the initial stages of the film (clearly modeled after PSYCHO [1960]) are its best parts but, in a way, I think that the Hitchcockian touches are laid on too thick: the police's antagonism toward Salt's liberal reporter heroine (who thinks she witnessed the deed) all too conveniently gives murderer and accomplice all the time they need to dispose of the body and clean up the mess; William Finley's evil 'mastermind' doesn't ring true in modern-day Manhattan, and the way he goes about exculpating himself - and Kidder - in the eyes (or, rather, mind) of the ever-intrusive Salt is way too melodramatic, i.e. old-fashioned; though it still makes for an undeniably effective plot twist or, if you like, the ultimate 'shock' tactic adopted by the director! Once again, I turned to Glenn Erickson's typically perceptive review at 'DVD Savant' to remind me of a particularly blatant 'miscalculation' which I had also sensed while watching the film. Quote: 'The actual witnessing of the murder is chillingly effective too, but brings up a glaring inconsistency in the film. By no means spoiling the movie, it is nevertheless a big Hitchcock no-no cheat. Grace is shown calmly walking to her window perhaps 30 seconds after the actual murder takes place. She sees a bloody hand writing 'Help' on a window, and recoils in alarm, indicating she was unaware of any problem before. And what can she (we) see? She can barely tell that the man is black. The rest of her view, which we see on one half of the split screen, is obstructed by the reflection of a brick wall on the glass. Yet Grace tells the cops she witnessed a murder, knows it was a stabbing, even describes the assailant, who never came anywhere near the window to be identified. It's a very cute confusion - on first viewing the murder is so shocking and the events so riveting that Savant just took Grace at her word. Maybe it's another Hitchcock reference - to the 'lying flashback' in STAGE FRIGHT (1950).'The extras on the Criterion DVD, though not large in number, are certainly expansive in content: a lengthy interview (made at the time of the film's release) with De Palma, which is pretty good; a newspaper article on the real-life saga that inspired the film; and an exhaustive stills and poster gallery. Also, the insert in the DVD keep-case contains two other essays which, like all of Criterion's liner notes, are a nice addition to the overall package. Despite all of this, however, I think that a 'Making Of' documentary or even a Brian De Palma Audio Commentary should not have been amiss!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sisters barely joined together at all!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I was one half of the Siamese twin couple featured in this film I'd consider myself lucky. I mean, they're barely joined together at all. The poster art gives you another impression, but if you take a look at that scene in the film you'll see what I mean. There are Siamese twins that share the same brain. If that was the case here I'd see the problem, but hey, it's not. "What the devil hath joined together let no man cut asunder!" Well, if they hadn't, there wouldn't be a movie to begin with.Brian de Palma's Sisters really turned into something completely different from what I'd originally expected. It starts with a rather brutal murder, with all it's bright colored red blood and it's shrieking moog score. You almost believe it to be the beginning of a 70's slasher movie with a Siamese twin twist. But the plot suddenly takes a completely different route and instead turns into a crime thriller in which a supporting character (or is she the leading lady now?)is bent on solving the murder. The police doesn't believe her story of course, they never do in these films, and the plot thickens as the body is hidden. The writer of the script for this film really tries to mess with your head at the end but doesn't quite nail it, at least not for me. But it's an honorable try.The Hollywood reporter supposedly thought this film was "the most genuinely frightening film since Hitchcock's Psycho" according to the original poster. I didn't, but I had a great time watching it anyway, as it's certainly a gem. I suppose it was considered scary at the time, and much of that has passed since, but I seriously doubt that people 30 years from now will think that the scary films of today, such as Ju-On: The Grudge, Cabin Fever or Wrong Turn are silly. What do I know?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing Derivative Horror Film, In The Hitchcock Tradition.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people tend to criticize Brian DePalma's films of being so similar to some of Hitchock's classics, but I find his films to be excellent nonetheless. "Sisters" revolves around Danielle Breton, a French-Canadian model/actress who was previously a Siamese twin, until doctors separated her from her twin sister, Dominique. When a nosy newspaper reporter, Grace Collier, witnesses the brutal stabbing of a man in Danielle's apartment from her window, she calls the skeptical cops who dismiss her as making a false accusation after searching Danielle's home, which seems to be free of any evidence of murder. Grace, insistent that Danielle has a twin sister, takes it upon herself to expose the crime, but there is something more sinister going on than she has to her knowledge..."Sisters" is possibly one of DePalma's finest films, although it doesn't get nearly as much recognition as many of his later films got (such as "Carrie" and "Dressed to Kill"). DePalma makes well use of the retro-style splitscreen effect, which gives the film a little more personality than most. Margot Kidder (who later went on to do horror classics "Black Christmas" and "The Amityville Horror") gives a strong and convincing performance as Danielle and her disturbed, twisted twin sister. She really shines here.The parallels to "Psycho" and "Rear Window", both Hitchcock films, are obvious, but even with these striking similarities, DePalma still crafts an interesting and original story, with stylish direction and an intriguing plot. And Bernard Herrman's (who also sported the score for "Psycho") effective score adds more to the tone of the film. The conclusion was obvious, for me at least, but if you don't know much about Hitchcock films the ending may come as a big surprise.Overall, "Sisters" is a creepy little horror movie that has some great acting, a derivative but good story, and an effective score to offer. The references to Hitchcock's films are almost everywhere, but DePalma manages to squeeze in his own style and make this an effective little horror mystery. For horror fans, I'd recommend this, but for those who are fond of DePalma's work, this is a complete must-see. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film Making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My thoughts on this movie are two-fold. First, the story and plot are only decent. The story centers around two women, Margot Kidder and Jennifer Salt. They are two very different personalities who are set up against one another for obvious reasons. Both give good performances but Kidder's character is the highlight of the film. She is sweet, sensitive, and extremely alluring but a tad off the wall. Her French Canadian accent was hard for me to decipher in the first part of the movie. I won't give away any of the plot but it is dated. The music score is good. My biggest frustration was the ending. Psychologically scary, yes, but definitely not the type of ending I was hoping for. It was a let down.My second thoughts deal with the cinematography used by director Brian De Palma. Excellent. I loved the camera work in this movie. The use of split screen is tremendous and the ending was filmed well. I just didn't care for the ending from a story perspective. Overall, a good movie. I rated it 5 out of 10. If you enjoy psychological thrillers/horror movies, you should enjoy it. Also, Alfred Hitchcock fans should give this one a look as well. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Hitchcock tribute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brian De Palma is a man that has become well known for doing tributes to Alfred Hitchcock, and this film here, is the best of them. The story follows that of a pair of Siamese twin sisters that were separated; one of which is, as the film bills; loving, kind and the gentle and the other, murderously mad! The story starts after one of the sisters picks up a man that she met on a game show that she works on. Then, when a female reporter from across the way sees the man murdered through a window, a horrific murder mystery ensues.The obvious Hitchcock influence in this movie comes from Psycho. For want of not wanting to spoil it, I wont say how but it will be evident to anyone watching the movie. Other notable tributes can be seen; obviously to Rear Window regarding the way that the murder is seen, and also to the underrated Hitchcock thriller; Rope, for the way that the body is hidden in a piece of furniture. It has been said of Brian De Palma that his work is pretentious plagiary, but I disagree. De Palma makes no secret of his love for Hitchcock, and therefore his tributes cannot be seen as plagiarism. The tributes are also done with great care and precision and it's obvious that De Palma really idolises Alfred Hitchcock from the way that the tributes are done, they cannot be considered "just another rip-off".As usual, De Palma has managed to find himself a beautiful leading lady in Margot Kiddler. Kiddler manages her double role with great care and manages to perfectly balance sympathy and intrigue, which is what is needed respectively for her two characters. The rest of the starring cast is made up by Jennifer Salt, Charles Durning and William Finley; all of which perform their roles well. The music in this film is also of note, and also another thing that could be attributed to Hitchcock's influence as he obviously used striking music to increase the potency of his movies.Sisters' main flaw, however, is the fact that the second half of the movie doesn't run as smoothly as the first. The first half is much more composed and more suspenseful than the second half, in which the movie loses some of what it has created earlier. However, the second half is still an exhibition of great B-movie making, but maybe the movie simply surpassed itself with its first 45 minutes.Sisters is a must see for the horror fan, and also the Hitchcock fan; in that it is worth seeing for a clear example of how the master has impacted cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plays fast with cheap tricks and makes bad acting virtuous...wobbly wobbly!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sisters (1973)I don't know the boundary between humor and stupidity, but this teeters more toward stupidity. There's no way you can take it seriously, so it's not like an actual horror film where twin sisters do the usual good sister bad sister thing. It's some kind of distanced parody of it, but the acting is stiff, and the plot stiff, and the whole thing filmed with a professional capability that goes nowhere special, but makes you take it seriously.I have to admit, de Palma has never worked for me--he's either so sexist, or abusive, or violent, or indulgent it just gets irritating. Yes, Knife in the Water has its chilling moments, and here there is some intelligence, for sure, like when the split screen effect reaches a point where the two viewpoints merge at the doorway (really nice). But it's a cheesy 1970s flick that pushes buttons and is, if you are insensitive, a fun ride. The inevitable comparison to Hitchcock makes the differences more salient than similarities--though Bernard Hermann does the score here (as in Psycho and other Hitchcock gems), and so the movie sounds like Hitch. But the themes and how they develop are divergent. For one thing, Hitchcock never seems to enjoy cruelty--he turns to humor, or to the artificial, to avoid actual conscious meanness. De Palma, here and elsewhere, uses nastiness for his own end, like Serrano uses shock, to get attention. One way to show this is to notice that there isn't a classic Hitchcock device--the innocent accused of the crime. We are mostly just drawn to the crime, and the criminal. The one outsider, the investigating columnist, is a device for the filmmaker to explore his theme--the conjoined twin idea in particular.Is this a dud or a failure. Not at all. There's a raw, 1970s frankness to it all, and a kind of fast, uncomplicated development of plot, that is gripping, if you let it be. But be prepared. If you aren't predisposed to enjoy an over the top, highly deliberate film that leaves you outside the drama, you might find it slightly ridiculous. With enough sense of humor, you might find it hilarious, or, like Blue Velvet, campy and "fun." But it's not my kind of joy ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A reporter witnesses a murder in a neighbor's apartment but there's no evidence of the crime when the police arrive. This cheesy thriller launched De Palma's quest to become the successor to Alfred Hitchcock. Based on the evidence here, instead of Master of Suspense, he could more aptly be called Master of Incompetence. The script starts off as an amateurish mystery but winds up as an incomprehensible mess featuring an extended delusional sequence. Although he borrows elements from Hitchcock's "Rear Window," "Psycho," and "Spellbound," De Palma doesn't have even a fraction of the master's talent for telling a good story. A decent cast is wasted.</fullReview>

In fact, it would be easy to accuse De Palma of having very few ideas of his own?if it wasn't for the film's bonkers final act, which is far freakier than anything that Alfred ever came up with. Danielle's demented history is told in a warped, hallucinatory flashback that is so bizarre and unique that one can easily forgive De Palma for the film's less original elements.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for Margot Kidder's irresistible French accent?a psycho has never sounded sexier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Palma's "first"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danielle Breton (Margot Kidder) has a problem. Namely the one that lives with her in her Staten Island apartment. Also, her ex-husband stalks her during a date. To add salt to the wound, that date winds up dead the next day in her apartment - with a crusading reporter neighbour as a witness to the scene. What exactly happened, and why?It is with this ingenious creeper that writer/director Brian De Palma hits his stride. He made a name for himself for crafting awesome and elaborate suspense sequences, and this is where he started. Taking cues from, and showing a blatant love of Hitchcock, De Palma begins his quest to seduce and deceive the audience's eyes, a trait which will soon become forever linked to the auteur's name.Take a scene for example where the reporter Grace Collier (Jennifer Salt in a riotously intrepid performance) witnesses the horrible scene from her apartment. It shouts "Rear Window", but then De Palma throws one of many surprises at the audience, by splitting the screen in two and showing two scenes simultaneously, one from the point of view of Danielle, and the other of Grace. They both have dialogue and movement, so keeping up with both of them is a challenge. This scene also adds a layer of De Palma's trademark intrigue - the duality of opinion. Whose eyes do we choose to see through? Where does their point of view end and the other's begin? This split screen also adds extra tension - will she get caught? Will the cops arrive on time?Margot Kidder, who would game greater fame as Lois Lane in the "Superman" films, is stunningly beautiful in the film, and De Palma makes sure the audience gets that in the film's early scenes. Part voyeuristic, part encapsulating, all hypnotic - De Palma make sure the Gregory Sandor's camera lingers on Kidder's face and body, well, until the scars are revealed, naturally.What follows after the murder scene is a delightful trip down Hitchcock Lane as pieces of "Vertigo" and "Rear Window" (two films I suspect are De Palma's favorites) as Grace (perhaps named after the Princess herself?) investigates the crime by herself, seeing that the police refuse to help her following a not-so-appealing article on them. Intriguing, even though the movie-loving audience have seen it before, done by master Hitch himself.Then comes the brilliantly bizarre final act of the movie that pulls the rug from under the audience and becomes pure De Palma. He heightens all senses and purposely makes the audience both disoriented and hypnotized, putting the audience under his spell as they watch both amazed and dizzy at what they are seeing. The camera becomes dizzy, with multiple angles and grainy close-ups galore, complete with disoriented black and white to add an eerie aura to it, and combined with Hitch regular Bernard Herrmann's wildly sensual score heightens the tension up many notches. The scene then becomes bizarrely eerie, almost hallucinogenic at times. By the time the film ends the audience will be disoriented and confused at what they saw, as the film leaves the conclusion open for them to answer. A wise decision from De Palma, as a proper closure would feel like a cop-out.De Palma's "Sisters" sets the groundwork for things to come as it contains many of his trademarks, but on it's own it stands as a finely- crafted suspense thriller, always enticing and playing with its audience like a piano maestro, full of genuine surprises while still winking at a passionate love for all things Hitchcock - with an ending that will leave many heads turning, for good measure. It is also pretty scary and disturbing - what a suspense thriller/horror film is supposed to do, and De Palma does it very, very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I saw a murder, and I'm going to prove it"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 'Dressed to Kill (1980)' scared the living daylights out of me, I wanted to see some more films from Brian De Palma, and 'Sisters (1973)' looked like a good bet: sibling rivalry erupts between two recently-separated Siamese twin sisters, one of whom is purportedly psychotic. De Palma was the ultimate Hitchcock imitator, both technically and thematically. 'Sisters' and 'Dressed to Kill' each approach the issue of sexual voyeurism in a similar manner to 'Psycho (1960)' and Michael Powell's 'Peeping Tom (1960).' One clever sequence in 'Sisters' depicts, in true Hitchcockian style, the efforts to two people to conceal the traces of a murder, and De Palma cleverly uses split-screens to elevate the suspense and to underscore his dominant theme of voyeurism. In this case, De Palma even uses a musical score from Bernard Hermann - who, by this time, had become estranged from Hitchcock because the director rejected his composition for 'Torn Curtain (1967).' However, 'Sisters' is hampered by a really, really schlocky screenplay that makes it feel more akin to William Castle than the Master of Suspense. An annoying character goes about trying to expose a murder, unaided by police detectives who behave so idiotically that I almost wanted to throw something at the projector screen. Perhaps it was De Palma's intention that both the characters and the story achieve virtually nothing by the film's end; like the audience, the characters are mere voyeurs, too timid to interrupt the murder plot that is unfolding. There's a cleverly-unnerving touch in the final scene, as private investigator Larch (Charles Durning) hangs suspended from a telephone pole, awaiting the non-existent collector of the "murder couch." At the beginning of the film, the audience was the voyeur, watching through a television screen (perhaps from a couch) as Lisle Wilson's character ogles Margot Kidder. This time, it's you on the couch who is being watched.</fullReview>

She's separated from her Siamese twin Dominique Blanchion who is angry about being left behind in a mental hospital. It's their birthday and Dominique is coming for a visit. When Philip returns with a birthday cake, he is stabbed to death by a crazed Dominique which is witnessed by neighbor reporter Grace Collier (Jennifer Salt). Her ex-husband Emil is stalking her and finds Danielle disoriented and Philip dead. He helps her hide the dead body in the foldaway couch. Police detectives Kelly and Spinetti investigate but they don't find a body. The cops distrust the reporter and Grace must investigate on her own. Her editor insists on hiring private detective Joseph Larch (Charles Durning) to join her.I often complain that characters in movies never call the cops. It's almost as bad when the cops turn out to be idiots. It doesn't make sense that the first cops on the scene are detectives rather than patrolmen. There's an argument about exigent circumstance which seems overblown and unreasonable. I can't understand why Grace is allowed into the apartment other than a need to advance the plot. If this actually happened, I expected uniformed cops to come and knock on the door looking for a victim. The cops dragging their feet is suppose to build tension but it build annoyance for me.Director Brian De Palma is doing a homage to Alfred Hitchcock. There is a good deal of fun Rear Window scenes. The last act is quite compelling. There are a lot of goodness here but there are a few things keeps annoying me. I really don't understand why Larch doesn't call the cops about the couch. If they find the body, the cops could get the couch delivered in their own sting. These little logic problems just bug me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie begins simple. If there is no Criterion mark on DVD, one may think that its a horror flick and it is actually a horror flick got prestigious somehow except for the fact that the plays are surprisingly good. Specially Margot Kidder delivers an outstanding performance as a French Disturbed woman. The African American guy looks like a potato but that's how most guys act when a stranger woman surprisingly asks them out. I would say it was an awesome performance in potatoness! The plot is simple and easy to follow. ***Now I warn you, this is going to be a real spoiler***. The woman who murdered the black guy was in the bed while it is clearly shown that Danielle was unconscious in bathroom although we never discover the nature of those very important pills nor we never find out why she needed more when she just took 2 pills 5 minutes before. Anyways, what I'm saying is, despite the outcome of the movie that Danielle and her sister are essentially the same person, Danielle can not be the woman in bed murdering the guy. I don't want to say the plot had problem but it was rather a defect in one scene. I think based on the outcome of the movie, Plama should have re written the scene. Another problem was the faith of the couch. It ended up next to a railroad in Canada while the private detective was watching it from the top of a telephone or power pole. There is a corpse in that couch for God's sake, it should grossly stink. Not only there is no foul smell (I say it based on the arrangement of the scene) but we do not know what took the private detective to get close and inspect/report the couch. The ending was unclear in murky way otherwise it was a descent entertaining movie, not something extraordinary and certainly does not belong to the Criterion line of movies. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Early Effort From De Palma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes a TV channel can surprise you . There I was watching THE INVADERS on the UK Horror Channel wondering what graphic and mediocre movie the channel was going to throw up at us as it normally does on a 9pm weeknight . Flicking through the info button I caught the synopsis and instantly thought I was going to be something along the lines if BASKET CASE a film that despite having a cult following I wasn't mad keen on . So doing what every other puzzled film fan does I came on to this site to catch a bit more info and was slightly surprised to see it had an average user rating of 7.0 which is quite high for something being broadcast on The Horror Channel . I then glanced at the credits and was shocked to discover it's an early effort from Brian De Palma ! Hold the front page because " De Palma directs a film that is being broadcast on The UK Horror Channel " is definite headline news and let's not forget that from CARRIE to CARLITO'S WAY he was one of Hollywood's leading film makers . This alone makes this rather obscure and early work from the director worth seeking out De Palma is something of an acquired taste and he does sometimes come in for heavy criticism such as " one trick pony " and " Hitchcock plagiarist " and to be blunt you could make the exact criticism about BLOOD SISTERS . This was made during The New Hollywood period when film making movie brats discovered post modernism and obviously De Palma has seen REAR WINDOW . The main plot involves a person witnessing a murder from the window of a facing apartment , calling the police and the police finding no evidence , but to say it's a rip off of a 1950s Hitchcock classic is to do it a disservice . The story is very much updated to the 1970s since the witness is now a career woman who works as a journalist which is something very few women would have had in the way of a career20 years earlier . The heroine is a lot more proactive than what Jeff was in REAR WINDOW and I felt the major problem in that film was that it too static for its own good . There's also an air of weary 70s cynicism where the police are useless are to be blunt total " pigs " . Since the Hays Code had been nullified a few years previously the film contains much more graphic violence than you'd have seen in a 1950s movie One thing Hitchcock described about his movies was " The ice-box effect " By this he meant when you watched one of his movies you went to the ice box to grab yourself a beer then - bang . You stop to think about the plotting and everything collapses and we see the same thing here . Someone gets stabbed to death and within the ten minutes of it being witnessed and the police arriving it's possible to get blood stains out of the carpet etc . The story suffers these unlikely implausible aspects and relies a little bit too much on coincidence and bad luck to drive the story forward . Bernard Herrman's score is very intrusive and again reminds you of his work for Hitchcock . You also tend to notice De Palma's style that he uses in nearly all his movies so despite it being an example of his early work there's a feeling of seen it all before . That said it is a highly involving tense thriller and I did enjoy this more than the film that inspired it so thanks to The Horror Channel for broadcasting it and I look forward to seeing more obscure works by Hollywood auteurs turning up</fullReview>

I was like 5 or 6 when we went to see this at the movies and yes I guess my parents snuck me in because It was rated R. The only part of this movie I can remember is a body in a couch and blood coming out the back and the couch maybe being in a truck. My parents could not remember the movie my uncle that went with us could not remember the movie or even having been there but I know we were. Now then I have a new mission to find this movie and watch it again. I can not comment much on the greatness of the film other than it must have been one heck of a movie to stick with me this long and driven me to search this hard for it. Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a movie knowing ONLY "Blood seeping out of back of couch????????"I know that one of the actors is still starring in movies and has acted in sevral that I have loved like Collosus:The Forbin Project and Best Little Whorehouse in Texas</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After having watch DePalma's "Sisters" on late night television way before cable became the phenomenon it is now, I have to say it was a horrific, blood churning experience. (Warning: Spoilers upcoming) First of all, they showed the murder of a black man by Margot Kidder's surviving Siamese twin virtually uncut. Even the "butcher knife" to the mouth" scene, one of the most lurid scenes on record. Then, in DePalma's "split" scene, with Jennifer Salt watching, Kidder and her surgeon husband (Bill Finley) stuff the carcass in a couch and clean the murder scene so neatly that no one can tell there was foul play. To me, this is incredible in a bad way. The last scene was probably the goriest: The killing of the doctor after he orders Kidder to do away with Salt. It's hard to believe she had to literally squeeze his guts out for Dr. Finley to finally die. Very depraved movie, for DePalma's (and possibly David Cronenberg's) fans only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Separation Can Never Sever Those Family Ties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1973's "Sisters" is basically a sinister, little "good girl/bad girl" horror story which reveals to us the evil that lurks within.As this film's title suggests, the girls in question here are, in fact, sisters. The twist to the story is that Danielle and Dominique (though now separated) were born as Siamese twins, joined at the hip.OK. Let's face it, even though Sisters, as a horror film, would never win any prizes for originality and is pretty tame by today's horrific standards of gore, it does contain a pretty gruesome murder - And, during a freaky and very effective, little fantasy sequence, we are witness to the horrendous approach that was taken in order to separate these twins.Directed by Brian De Palma in the early years of his career, Sisters may be far from being considered a really great horror film, but, all the same, it is quite an unsettling, little gem, in its own right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bizarre but fantastic homage/parody/pastiche of Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I generally think of Brian DePalma as a hack, so I came into Sisters very suspicious. I knew of its label as an "homage" to Hitchcock's films, and, in the back of my mind, my goal was to pronounce it a cheap rip-off of them. But it was immediately interesting to me. I love the way it begins, and I liked every minute up until the first major event of the film. Then enters the character of Grace Collier, an editorial writer who thinks she sees a murder in an apartment across the way from her. I thought the plot got a little clunky at this point, but nearer the end I realized that I just missed where DePalma was going. This isn't simply an homage to Hitchcock. There are several direct homages to his films, especially from Psycho, Rear Window, and Marnie. But it took me a long time to realize that this wasn't meant as a thriller or a drama, which is what I was assuming. This is a comedy, a parody. It's actually quite a humorous movie once you understand that. Amazingly, it also works as a suspense film. I was gritting my teeth during the climactic sequence. Now I wonder if Hitchcock himself ever saw this film and, if so, what he thought of it. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although not De Palma's first work, it certainly rates as his worst. Perhaps he was clearing his throat before "Carrie."The production quality makes its television contemporaries "Streets of San Francisco" and "Police Woman" look and sound utterly slick by comparison. Margot Kidder's attempt at a French Canadian accent is laughably bad. The plot twists are implausible. (How do you clean gallons of blood from a snow-white carpet and couch in 5 minutes?) The "shocking" ending is trite and predictable from the first ten minutes of this mess. And De Palma must have been the ONLY person in this country still describing people as "colored" in 1973, a full two years after "Shaft." Fast forward to the bit parts played by Olympia Dukakis, Barnard Hughes, and Charles Durning and skip the rest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"This girl has an evil twin see...but she actually doesn't." That pretty much sums up DePalmas problem. He doesn't know when he has a crappy idea that's too junky to investigate; and he never knows when he's clumsily manhandled a movie into an overwrought mess.It was here that DePalma began his career producing dreck, and established his willingness to shoot continually inept scripts. He rushes over too many stupid implausible developments apparently because he can't wait to film that big sequence where he rips off Hitchcock again, or to belabor a nonexistent point by crosscutting. Why does Grace Collier sit though the whole murder is she sees the whole thing the way she describes? Why is it filmed differently? If he wasn't in such a hurry to excrete another one of these he might actually have the visuals reinforce his script. Instead he looks for strong visuals and camera-work that doesn't compliment the story or ideas (ha ha, ideas... in a DePalma movie!).This one heaps insult on injury. and it's about as deep as a cartoon. There's also room for a hunchback, an evil doctor, a drug induced dream, hypnotism, a terrible late Bernard Hermann score...etc. etc.DePalma has no guiding standard to evaluate his results against, not even Hitchcocks. He has an insensitive eye for composition, editing, camera-work etc. His films are ugly ugly ugly. He doesn't seem to realize that there are movies that came out of the seventies that don't look like episodes of Columbo. He is not a part of the seventies film renaissance.Whenever I think Hitchcock is all technique and no art, all I have to do is pop in a DePalma videotape; I am quickly reminded what someone with neither produces. The problem is DePalma thinks he has technique. (!) There's a bad, bad interview with him on this DVD in which you can observe him drawing simplistic wrong-headed conclusions about film.I pity DePalma for having no higher goal in life but to reassemble superior Hitchcock films into hack cross-pollinations. Sisters is more idiotic than most of his movies, but it may actually be the worst movie I've ever seen; and I've seen so much junk by now that you really have to suck in some extraordinary way to get a good place on the list. He should've began his career emulating a director with his own values; Ed Wood.Laugh out loud crap. Maybe he can make something out of the Black Dahlia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ham sandwich of a B-movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blood Sisters is a jarring who-what-why dunnit that's very much of its time. Whether it works for contemporary audiences ... well, I'm not so sure.The film starts by introducing Margot Kidder as a French Canadian actress/model and 'star' of a dubious TV game show built around voyeurism. As opening's go, it has its own flavour of disturbing, but it does cleverly mirror exactly the theme of the movie in a less than a minute: if you were witness to something private, would you do 'the right thing'?After an interesting premise, there's a slow and laboured build-up to a one-night stand, a menacing ex-husband, a secret twin and an inevitable - and very schlocky - murder. For me, the movie only briefly comes to life in the middle, where we have local beat reporter Jennifer Salt (the only halfway believable presence in the movie) witnessing the crime from across the street. When the police refuse to take her seriously, she sets out to investigate on her own, sometimes accompanied by her hilariously critical mother.Blood Sisters does its 'moments' well - there's intermittent tension, gore, black comedy and frustration, but otherwise it seems to lope along fairly immaturely. My biggest gripe - purely as a modern viewer - is in the film's extremely outdated ideas about mental health and disability. It's not so much about 'investigating' anything as going straight for the shock factor.I could forgive that if there were was something more endearing about this movie. I did like the overall feel and mood of the movie, down to the jerky editing and its rather obvious plot twists, but the acting is too hammy to be anything other than distracting. The ending is a masterpiece of short-change: not so much who-dunnit as huh-dunnit ... Yep, it left me stumped.I'd probably watch this movie again but not because it's good. It's an underwhelming 5/10 for me.</fullReview>

The movie was way too slow, way too boring and way too weird - and I admit I didn't understand the ending at all. Even Bernard Herrmann's music didn't work for me - like the rest of the movie it was way too over the top.There were some minor surreal moments, but just like in "Rosemary's Baby", it didn't save the film.Olympia Dukakis is great in a tiny (and uncredited) role as a Louise Wilanski from the bakery.

		<shortDescription>Decent early de Palma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SISTERS is the first Brian de Palma film that sees the director working in his preferred genre (thriller) and with all the elements that he's revisited time and again during his career, from the Hitchcock homages and stylistic flourishes to the joyous score (Herrmann, of course). This film is kind of a combination of REAR WINDOW and PSYCHO, with journalist heroine Grace (played with everyday charm by Jennifer Salt) investigating a dodgy neighbour, played by the excellently creepy Margot Kidder, a long way from her most popular role as Lois Lane.Sure, the film is predictable, and rough around the edges, with the extra-low budget excluding the kind of dazzling cinematography that de Palma would later bring to the likes of CARLITO'S WAY, but nevertheless it proves to be more than entertaining thanks to the anything-goes nature of the script and of course the stylish direction. The whole first half hour is a wonderful piece of set-up that leads to a genuinely provocative murder set-piece, as inspired as THAT shower scene in its own way.From then on in, the ride is more mixed, with the film stalling in places and wizzing along in others. De Palma has an eye for supporting talent and gets good value from the peerless Charles Durning as a dedicated private eye and William Finley as the bug-eyed, creepy husband. Okay, so it's not entirely successful, and the ending does lack a certain resolution, but overall it has the same kind of fresh, intriguing, slightly distasteful appeal as the early films of David Cronenberg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw Sisters for the first time on TCM Underground. I really wanted to see it and was fairly predisposed to like it. I'm a big Hitchcock fan and I like many of Mr. De Palma's other movies, particularly Dressed to Kill, Blow Out, and The Untouchables. However, I have to say I was generally disappointed with Sisters. Here are some of my issues.Margot Kidder's Accent- It seems like Margot's accent distracted more than a few people and I confess it got to me. Not that I thought it wasn't an accurate depiction of a broken English/French Canadian accent, it was just over the top and in the final analysis, unnecessary. So she came from Quebec, she doesn't have to sound like a fur trader in every frame.The Pills- The pills are another source of distraction. We come to understand that she needs to take these pills or else she transforms into the evil Dominique. OK but what about the dosage. It's the morning after and she has four pills left. She takes two and sets two precariously on the lavatory top. A short while later she is disturbed to find that the other two pills have disappeared and she is desperate. Why? If four pills is the "correct" dosage to fend off the transformation, why not take the four pills in the first place. Answer, it was necessary to the plot line because she needs to transform and commit the murder.Someone's At The Door- During the pill sequence we have "Dominique" come to the front door. Here we're visually "tricked" into believing (at that time in the story) that there is a real Dominique. While Danielle sits in the bathroom, Dominique knocks on the door and calls her name. You might be able to say that this is Danielle "hearing" her sister in her brain and we viewers are somehow able to tune in on that. But, then we see two shadows at the doorway. That's beyond any logic I could come up with and, at worst, is just a cheap way to trick the audience.Paging Dr. Emil- Now more about the pills. When her lover doesn't come back right away with the pills from the drugstore she calls Dr. Emil. He certainly knows quite well the danger involved if she doesn't get medicated. He apparently hurries over since he's back at the apartment before her lover BUT he doesn't go up and give her a shot or some more pills! He sits in the car smoking a cigarette long enough for Danielle/Dominique to carve up the poor guy. Maybe he was afraid she had already transitioned into Dominique and he could be put to the sword. Of course the real answer is he couldn't come up right away, it wouldn't have furthered the plot line.The Cover Up- While the reporter tries in vain to get the NYPD to respond logically to someone reporting a potential homicide, Dr. Emil and Danielle set about cleaning up the murder scene. At first I thought, "They're crazy! There's no time to clean all that blood up and how would you clean the carpet that fast? And what about all the blood that must be on the sleeper sofa since it was the initial site of Danielle/Dominique's attack". It took me a little time to realize that the living room had a tile floor. Not typical but possible. And what do you know; there was no blood spatter on the sofa. Not probable but possible. The real logic problem here is what happened to the sofa-bed mattress? In order to fit the victim into the sofa-bed they removed the mattress. This is logical since he certainly wouldn't fit in there with the mattress. Dr Emil carries off some stuff in a garbage bag but it sure didn't include a queen-size, 6 inch deep mattress. The police finally arrive and walk through the apartment with the reporter in tow but they don't find a spare mattress. If they had it just might have led even those dolts to ask why it wasn't on the sofa-bed. But of course it was necessary for the mattress to disappear to "further the plot line".Dr. Emil's Removable Bruise- For some unknown reason, the screenplay has Dr. Emil slip (probably on the wet tile in the living room) and take a nasty bruise on his head. This is one of those deals where I suspect that the real actor got a nasty bruise and they didn't want to hold up filming so they put this scene in to cover for the obvious problem. It's unlikely but why else have him take a fall. The problem here is that later on when he and Danielle go to his private lunatic asylum the bruise (like the sofa-bed mattress) has mysteriously disappeared. Luckily it returns shortly thereafter when he confronts and questions the reporter.I understand that Mr. De Palma made this film on a very restricted budget and has himself indicated that he would have re-shot portions of it if he'd had the time and money. That probably explains some of the logic issues and continuity problems. The real shame is that if I wasn't so distracted by some of the loose ends I might have really enjoyed the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all Margot Kidder's performance was really odd. On the other hand I was surprised at how cute she looked just 5 years before she starred in "Superman". OK, back to her performance. I haven't guessed her accent is French before I was told so. When she acted drunk she didn't act much different than to when she was not drunk. It was like her character had an alcohol level of 200 milliliters all the time. She sure didn't seem like the brightest girl. So much about her. The movie was pretty stylish, as always when De Palma is on it, and the score was very...well...PRESENT. Pretty good, though. It made the half movie. The first murder scene is quite effective but this is some of the most fake looking blood I've ever seen in a movie. So SHE kills the guy (there's no twin sister anymore). Something I suspected (and feared) from beginning on. Especially since the Danielle talking to her "sister" scene reminds so much on "Psycho". On the other hand (unlike in "Psycho") you can HEAR her sister from another room while Danielle is on screen! And you can even see the shadow of something that looks like a woman which wouldn't be all too bad if there were an explanation given by the end of the movie. Which directly leads me to the most important point of critique. There is no real conclusion to the story. The unanswered questions remain that way and even though there were scenes that had that "pinned on" feeling to it, they weren't revealing or concluding at all. Not even the character of Danielle seems to have a real conclusion. The final shot is more than odd since I don't see the relevance of it. The b/w dream sequences (so to speak) have a nice touch but they don't add to the story in any way. I enjoyed the long split screen sequences, as always (I could watch a whole movie in split screen). The reasons why the movie makes no sense: The way it was shown it is very unconvincing that she murdered the guy (for the obvious reasons). She looks completely different when she murders him, she wears different clothes, her hair is more tousled and Danielle is ALREADY lying in the bathroom (the same way as before) while the guy is STILL living and waving out of the window. We can see this thanks to split screen. There is no time in between. Unlike in "Psycho" the schizophrenia persona is not believable due to underdevelopment and missing explanations. And the other reasons given before. Overall there is way too less information given. In the end we know pretty much nothing. By not giving us some details it's taking the easy way out. And very easy that is. It's a shame De Palma often wants simply too much with his stories and in the end it's a total mess that lacks logic, leaving the whole movie just mediocre. Because his directing craft is tremendous. Maybe it's also because he's adjusting his stories to his direction instead of doing it the other way around (like normal people ;). You can see that the movies he hasn't written himself are much more...let's say "usual" but also more logic.5/10</fullReview>

(Have you ever tried to move a fold out couch down several flights of stairs?) Charles Durning steals the show as a dumb*s private eye. The funniest scene is when he breaks into an apartment while being watched from across the courtyard (a la "Vertigo").

		<shortDescription>One of the dumbest thrillers of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This junk reveals the full extent of de Palma's inability to think clearly and his utter disdain for logic. The first half-an-hour is particularly awful, full of nonsense only Palma can unleash on the viewers.1) When the reporter witnesses the crime she JUST HAPPENS to be watching out of her window (she was typing). She JUST HAPPENS to have Superman-like vision (funny that, her being played by Margot Kidder), managing to see a stretched bloodied hand through the window in the middle of the day. Ever tried to look through someone's window during daytime? Exactly.2) She phones the police to report the murder but JUST HAPPENS to be an investigative reporter who JUST HAPPENS to write articles against the police, and presumably, authority in general, which of course doesn't make the police too happy. (Of course, it's 1973, and it was particularly fashionable to behave like a hippie imbecile and hate authority of EVERY kind, so De Palma joined in on this low-IQed fad.)3) When the police finally arrive - about an aeon later - they give her, as the old nobody-believes-me routine will have it, a hard time and just generally plenty of suspicion and animosity. The police are not only slow and stupid like in most other Tinseltown movies with anti-authority agendas, they are also complete paranoiacs. I'm not here to defend the police, but if they were just half as moronic as they are in most pictures - especially this one - there would be no more reason to build more jails, as is the case, but to turn them into museums.4) After they enter the apartment, the scene of the crime, our luckless reporter JUST HAPPENS to slip on the floor, destroying (while carrying) the only piece of evidence she has - a birthday cake, in this case. Now, this sort of stupid plot-device is acceptable in a slapstick comedy where, let's say, Laurel slips on a banana, and in the process ruins Oliver's cake. But to use this as an excuse for the movie to go on, i.e., to use this as a means of allowing the murderess to avoid getting caught, is preposterous. From this point onwards, at the latest, the movie becomes a farce of legendary proportions hence lacks suspense, though it does provide plenty of reason to snicker and giggle. Brian De Ed Wood Palma? 5) When the police FINALLY arrive at the scene of the crime (after stopping for some dough-nuts, I assume) the "ex-husband" of our sociopathic Margot Kidder JUST HAPPENS to be slipping away just at the very moment as the police and the reporter reach the floor on which Kidder lives. Now, this kind of Blake-Edwardsian/Inspector-Clouseauian film element works in silly comedies but to apply it the way De Wood Palma does is truly mind-boggling.6) Back to the first fifteen minutes, when Margot the Psycho seemingly talks to her twin/Siamese (whatever) sister. It is so bleedin' OBVIOUS what de Palma was trying to do by not showing the "two" sisters. It should be so obvious to even the most moronic viewer that De Palma is again stealing from Hitchcock, in this case from "Psycho". It is outright "bleedin' obvious" that Margot's twin is dead. Just like in Psycho, we've got voices in dialog form behind closed doors. Now who is De Palma going to fool with this cliché? (Well, morons, obviously.) And then, after a full hour Wood-Palma informs the viewer as if it were a God-inspired revelation that Margot's twin is long-dead. What a surprise!? No f**king kidding! And there I was thinking it was her sister doing the killings when all along it was her, one and the same little ol' Margot, complete with a split personality.What a stupid, stupid plot twist. You can smell it a mile away.7) Yet another fantastic coincidence is saved for the last third of the film. In the segment where our super-unlucky heroine witnesses some strange behaviour from Kidder and her loving surgeon-turned-lover-turned-corpse-cover-up-expert in a mental institution, she decides to telephone the police (presumably). As our heroine reaches for a telephone in the building, a mental patient with a chronic phobia of telephones appears out of nowhere and prevents her from using it! De Palma again proves to be too lazy to think of something intelligent (or at least reasonably logical) in the ways of preventing the reporter from ending this idiotic film by solving the "mystery", so he decides to throw in this laughable mental-patient character who makes such a fuss - as all mental patients are expected to do at any given time about anything and anybody ? so that as a result our heroine not only fails to inform the police but also gets into some seriously cretinous trouble.This mental patient JUST HAPPENS to be there (in the middle of the night), and she JUST HAPPENS to have a problem with unhygienic telephone use. This shitty little scene has to be SEEN TO BE BELIEVED! Just a comment on the subject of coincidences in films. I am fully aware that the vast majority of films contain coincidences. I am also aware that these coincidences often serve a useful purpose as far as helping the plot move along instead of dragging like in a dull Iranian drama. However, there is a difference between viable coincidences and utterly absurd ones as we have them here.Additionally, you cannot build an ENTIRE movie on coincidences. "Sisters" manages to have anywhere from 2 to 5 in a space of ten minutes. A sign of lazy writing and/or poor thinking and/or lack of talent and/or a latent contempt for the viewer and/or a belief that every single viewer is an imbecile without capacity for rational thought.One day it should be possible to sue a movie's creators for (the intention of doing) mental harm on its viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good premise, poor execution.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh man, this movie starts off great. The first thirty minutes is spectacular. We follow Danielle Breton (played by a beautiful young Margot Kidder), a French-Canadian model who's being stalked by her ex-husband, and things pick up pretty quickly from there.Unfortunately the rest of the film is a disservice to the exposition. What happened?Well, what should be a psychological thriller devolves into a trite, mindless murder mystery. Well, it's not *technically* a mystery, but the formula is the same: Grace is pretty confident she witnessed a murder (she was correct, but her confidence is overstated). After that, for the next thirty minutes (at least), she tries to gather evidence of this atrocity.Perhaps if the film focused more on the "psychological thriller" aspect and less on the "murder mystery," this movie could have lived up to its potential. Less Jennifer Salt and more Margot Kidder, please.As it stands, "Sisters" serves as a good example of how much the art of film has evolved for the better in the past 30 or so years. Most contemporary films would nary even waste ten minutes much less half the film on something as trivial as the whole murder mystery ordeal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear readers of this comment,there are films like Body Double,Scarface,Black Dalia,and some others,these are great movies,but this comment will take place where a movie Sisters(1973)will be loved,and hated by millions of movie and Brian De Palma fans.As I sad there are good movies from our director.Let me this time warning you,If your depression is not enough to feel you still living,yes just see this movie,but I rather recommend something else.This is not a real bad film,just does not contains entertaining value.It's slow,and content quality is not good,or new,If you wants to be entertained just watch Arlington Road,that will be depressing,but entertaining in one time.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock, Redux</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. DePalma has spent much of his career dodging allegations that he is a grade B copycat who has seen so many Hitchcock films he is capable of nothing but ripping off the master of suspense. Anyone who has seen Alfred's work will think this true after seeing "Sisters." I'm not bothering to delve into plot or character arch. What's important here is that while making this film, DePalma had a video monitor set up next to his camera with Hitchcock's masterworks playing. Whole chunks of this film have been lifted out of Psycho, Rear Window, Rope, Spellbound, etc. There isn't a plot devise or camera move DePalma wasn't afraid to steal. One can pay tribute to ones influence through subtle nods or an expanding of familiar themes and ideas. What Brian DePalma crafted in "Sisters" constitutes little more than highway robbery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Spoil it so Early?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sisters (1973) *** (out of 4) A low-key reporter (Jennifer Salt) witnesses a murder in her neighbors apartment but the cops won't believe her due to some negative stories she's written about them so she decides to try and solve the case herself. Through research she learns that the woman in the apartment is a siamese twin. Danielle (Margot Kidder) is a sweet and kind actress while the twin, Dominique (also Kidder) is a psychopath. After the reporter learns this she must then determine where the body is located so she hires a detective (Charles Durning). I went into this thriller knowing very little about it but if you know DePalma's work then you know he loves Hitchcock and tries throwing hints to that master's previous films. Rear Window, Rope and Psycho all play a major part in this story but I must say that DePalma relies so heavily on one of these films that it's easy to spot what's going on here within the first thirty-minutes. I'm really not sure why the director made is so obviously clear to what's going on and who the murderer is and he even goes as far as to play music from the Hitchcock film that gives away the ending to this movie. With that in the open, this is still a very stylish and neat little thriller that has a rather shocking and violent murder sequence where DePalma does a terrific job at building the suspense through some quick editing and brilliant use of split screens. Throughout most of the running time DePalma builds up the suspense level but it can never get too high simply because it's easy to spot what's going on and how it's going to be paid off. The performance by Kidder is really impressive as she does a great job at playing both "twins" in the film. Salt never gets the credit she deserves but she too is very good here and Durning also offers some nice humor in his few scenes. The score from Bernard Herrmann is wonderful and also helps to build some nice tension. In the end, this is a very impressive little film but I'm still scratching my head as to why DePalma ruins it so early with the homage to Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psycho behind the front window.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It' s probably the first De Palma work that counts and although it's far from being a masterpiece,it's quite entertaining ,without the excesses which will mar latter efforts.I would take any day "Sisters " and "obsession" Hitchcock pastiches over extravaganzas such as "Carrie" "Fury"(not to be mistaken for Lang's masterpiece(1936)) or the appalling "Raising Cain" ,which took again some twenty years later the twin sisters/brothers subject."Sisters " has a screenplay steeped in the Hitchcock world to a fault.Hints at "rear window " and " psycho" abound,as "Obsession" will be inspired by "Vertigo".But a good lead (Margot Kidder,later Lois Lane),a rather simple screenplay which,in spite of its implausibilities ,grabs the audience,a nice cinematography,a good use of the split screen and a knowing sense of space (the last sequence notably)save the movie and make it a commendable De Palma.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does not stand test of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't mind someone imitating Hitchcock, since I am a big fan of Hitch. The more, the better. But that does not hold true with this movie. The sound track is pyscho-70's and very annoying. Margot Kidder is not attractive, the blood and knife scenes are poorly done.The plot is very predictable. The ending was weak. I was hoping for a film noir gem or classic, but that is not the case here. The plot holes are many and interfere with the enjoyment of the film. I'm not a big fan of Margot Kidder and I do not think she acted well in this movie. Perhaps it was the plot. Not recommended. I've seen worse, but will certainly not bother with this one again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More like a mystery than a horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>yes, this movie was more of a mystery than a horror movie. At first I thought that it would be a good thriller after seeing the big cake scene but after that the film kinda dropped into nothingness. After a murder takes place a snooty reporter, seeing the murder take place through her window calls the police and reports the murder. More into getting facts about the murder for her story she would like to put in the paper the film then is about the reporter trying to prove the murder actually happened and the real plot about the twins soon fades. The movie takes a very strange twist and I become lost, maybe I may have missed something here in the middle of putting up with Kidder's phony French accent and the snooty obnoxious reporter butting her nose into somebody else's business that I lost track of what was going on. Then you have the split screen that makes me have to pay attention to two scenes instead of one. I didn't like that idea, it makes it look as if the person making the movie didn't have enough money involved to to put one screen and then another. This movie is for those into mystery and Hitchcock but no horror here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stock Characters and Transparent Writing Plague "Sisters"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that comes so close to being a classic, and yet falls horribly, horribly short. Sisters is a film that suffers from sub-par character design (the annoying reporter, the blundering cop, the European psychiatrist complete with beret) and a thinly veiled plotline that is difficult to accept as plausible. It is hard to develop any sort of affinity for the characters because they are all so annoying and two dimensional. If there is any great conflict in this film, it is when the viewer finds it difficult to side with 'the good guys,' the reporter and the detective, because their characters are so offensively antagonistic that you don't really care if their do-it-yourself murder investigation pans out or not. The story is a bland echo of Hitchcock's "Rear Window," but doesn't do that masterpiece justice at all. Go and rent that instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bill Finley is the only good thing about this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is rotten other than Bill Finley's other movies. This is also Brian De Palma's worst film after 1985's Wise Guys. I understand that De Palma was a young start up here, but what the heck is he trying to say with this film. He does his routine split screen for all of thirty minutes in this film which is annoying. This style of movie making should be reserved in minimal doses. Finely however does his usual great job of acting. It is a shame he's been out of work for 13 years. But in this movie he is utterly creepy and terrifying. His hair cut and accent make him almost unrecognizable from his other film roles. Margrot Kidder in this movie sucks and is dull. I have never really liked her acting and am thankful that she hardly does anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of low-budget style, but it doesn't add up...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock-buff Brian De Palma gets an intriguing, just-this-side-of-campy scenario going in "Sisters": twin siblings are involved in a murder, and quickly attempt to cover it up from a nosy female sleuth who witnessed a bloody "something" from her window. Too bad the flick falls apart after this promising first-act. Nothing interesting is done with Jennifer Salt's one-note character, and Margot Kidder (looking luminous) has next to nothing to work with. The film has drive and visual imagination to spare, but needed a less ritzy script to succeed. I'm not against minor cult items, they are quite often more entertaining and memorable than mass hits, but this one lets the viewer down early on. De Palma works for the moment, not for an overall effect, and I began losing my faith in him after the first hour. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow - really bad, but kinda fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm really surprised at all the praise for this movie. I admit, I did enjoy watching it but I was aghast at the clumsy direction and lame acting. I thought the idea of the story is great for a thriller but when every single word spoken in the film is so fake and stagey, how can you get caught up in it? Even Charles Durning comes off as just a silly stereotype as he plows through the 8th-grade-play dialogue. I enjoyed it partly as camp and partly because the story was good enough, and he pushed it to enough weird places that it was fun to see how it ended. The DVD includes the Life magazine article on Russian conjoined twins that inspired the story and that was a nice addition. I wouldn't want to warn off people who would enjoy this (DePalma fans, genre fans, etc) but be forewarned of the amateurishness.</fullReview>
