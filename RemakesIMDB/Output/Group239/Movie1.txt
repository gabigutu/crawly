		<fullReview>An unremarkable man is told he has Lampington's Disease and has only a few weeks to live, so he decides to spend his life savings on his remaining time left living a comfortable life in a seaside hotel. Straight away everything he touches turns to gold and he makes friends easily, gets golden business opportunities and even finds himself lucky in both the gambling and romance stakes.The staff at the hotel go on strike he rallies all the residents together and they fend for themselves, he bumps into the manufacturer of the farming implements he used to sell and tells him how to improve it and gets a partnership for his trouble.He even bumps into Sir Trevor Lampington the man who discovered the disease he's got and that's when our hero's luck changes again.When Sir Trevor tells him he hasn't got Lampingtons disease and it's confirmed, our man goes into deep joy as he's now able to take up all the offers he's received and truly lead a life of comfort. This is a tremendous film and Alec Guinness delivers a perfect performance of George Bird our main character who's luck changes from bad to worse to good to better and back again more than once throughout the film.With a couple of plot twists that you can see coming and a couple that come out of the blue so that the ending isn't obvious this is British film making at it's best. It's got a haunting violin theme also, and I'm not ashamed to say it made me shed a tear or two. This film is top of my list if it's ever released on VHS or DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favourite films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film and it's one of the few I've watched time and time again. It's a forgotten jewel and is infrequently mentioned. For me it has everything that was important of it's era. The social comment is mingled into an entertaining story. How the Health Service is expanding but people go hungry. An over worked Doctor making mistakes. George Bird being projected into a world that is not his own. The irony of riches coming his way when he thinks he has little time left. The Union's getting their grip on the country with strike action. How the upper classes view the lower and vice versa. How George Bird is now viewed as upper class because of his new setting. Post war money laundering. How war heroes can't find work. Love and jealousy. And the ironies - how he buys a dead man's clothes. How he swerves a car to avoid a dog that is due to be destroyed and turns into a road called 'Fallow End.' Then there is the acting. Sid James gives one of his great performance. His 1940's and 1950's work was superb. Sadly remembered for his Carry On performances more than the superb actor that he was. He just holds the scenes and in some cases is competing well with Guinness. For Guinness this is an early film. Ernest Thiesiger makes a great appearance along with many others including the delightful Kay Walsh. Esma Cannon's acting is well done - better than her later performances where 'silly' scripts let her down.Please do see it if you can. It's a little gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Little Guy Lives It Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Alec Guinness's first leading role in his first serious comedy. It has an original idea where an English clerk is erroneously told by the company doctor that he does not have long to live. So the clerk decides to take all the money that he saved and live it up at a ritzy resort hotel in England.The people and the way they spoke in 1950 seem dated but the story rings true. It is a great story on people's behavior, good and bad. It is great to see Kay Walsh as his leading lady. Mr. Guinness and Ms. Walsh worked several times together and they made a great team.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>exceptionally well done but a bit depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although most Americans have little knowledge of his work other than Star Wars, Alec Guinness produced an amazing body of work--particularly in the 1940s-1950s--ranging from dramas to quirky comedies. I particularly love his comedies, as they are so well-done and seem so natural and real on the screen--far different from the usual fare from Hollywood.This movie is the story of a man who thinks he is dying and decides to go out in style--living it up among the wealthy and well-bred. After all, he figures, he certainly won't need the money after he's gone! The marvelous acting and experiences among the upper crust make this a must-see. However, be forewarned, this is an incredibly depressing film. I doubt if I would have allowed the movie to be as dark as this one, but at least I can commend those who made it for not taking the easy way out and making a typical Hollywood style ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Overlooked Guinness Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because of the string of Ealing Comedies he made from 1949 on to 1958, from A RUN FOR YOUR MONEY to THE MAN IN THE WHITE SUIT to THE LAVENDER HILL MOB to THE LADYKILLERS to THE HORSE'S MOUTH, many fans of Alec Guinness keep forgetting this tragic comedy based on a J. B. Priestly story. Guinness plays George Bird, a salesman who is told he is dying of a rare illness called Lampington's Disease. He is told he has only a few months, so he might as well try to enjoy himself. Taking most of his savings, he goes to a fancy English resort. Instead of being a fish out of water, the quite Bird becomes a social success, making fantastic connections with others, including Sid James (as a wealthy manufacturer), winning at various gambling games, and even succeeding with the ladies. It is like all at once Bird's lifetime of humdrum living is being replaced by the success and potential he was always denied. Finally he even meets Dr. Trevor Lampington (Ernest Thiesinger, in a rather small part for a change), who tells Bird he is not suffering from Lampington's disease. And he is right - the doctor made a mistake. But fate interferes to make the title of this movie meaningful.The Priestly background to the story explains it's odd twistiness, and even fatalistic backbone. Think of AN INSPECTOR CALLS and how a faint chance at avoiding fate is lost there too. The film is a moody masterpiece, and reminds us of how our luck can change for the better and it still does not do us any good. No, it is not as funny as the Guinness comedies, but it is as fascinating as the best of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alec Guinness stars in "Last Holiday," a 1950 British film which was remade years later with Queen Latifah as the star. Though I enjoyed the warmth of the later version, the Guinness "Last Holiday," no surprise, is superior.Guinness plays a lower class Brit, George Bird, who is told he is going to die of a rare disease and has maybe a few months left to live. George quits his job, takes his savings, and goes to stay at a ritzy resort. There, he changes, and circumstances change for him. With nothing to loses any longer, he becomes outspoken. He also wins at poker, croquet, and a horse race. He's offered jobs. And there's the possibility of romance.This is supposedly a comedy, but it's not an uproarious one. It's more drama, in fact. George Byrd finds that all these wealthy people aren't all they're cracked up to be. He also finds out that when you let go and stop trying, opportunities appear. And he learns the difference between passing the time and doing something with your time.Alec Guinness is brilliant as George, timid at first, gaining stature with his new clothes, and asserting himself once he gets to the resort. It's a beautifully layered performance.Despite some sadness within the film, this is an excellent story of a man who learns life's lessons in a narrow space of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quaint and original but WICKEDEST Ending in Cineama History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absent for years in Europe on both TV and Video, I finally managed to acquire this one on a VHS tape from the US. A man learns he has a short time to live and decides to make the most of it by living it up in a luxury hotel. His life suddenly becomes far more interesting, makes more money than ever before and luck generally smiles him in the face. I remember seeing it about Thirty years ago and wondered how a new viewing would affect me. There were one or two disappointments, I had a memory of the film being rather more romantic than it actually is ( nothing much actually happens on this side ) and parts of the film are rather 'chatty'. This said the overall story is quite original. The film captures that now long-lost atmosphere of a luxury 1950's English hotel in the bright sunshine presumably situated in Devon or Cornwall (as we see palm trees in the garden. There are many well-known actors and the script is quite original to say the least. Another of J.B. Priestley's stories 'An Inspector Calls' was also made on film and is actually very good, even better than 'Last Holiday'. Nevertheless, the haunting theme music (solo fiddle) and thedécors are A1. Picture and sound quality are very good for the time (1950) and I am surprised that the film is not readily available on VHS and DVD everywhere! Of course, Alec Guinness was a great actor and his performance here is totally up to standard. If the romantic side of it all had been pushed just a little further the film would have been perfect for me ! The ending of the film is the Wickedest and most unexpected in the history of cinema !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sparkling Duo: Sir Alec and Kay Walsh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film happen to be at the top of my all time favourites.I always thought that Alec and Kay had a sparkle when acting together..."Oliver Twist";"Last Holiday";"The Horses Mouth";"Tunes of Glory"...I did not mention "Scrooge" because they did not appear together in any scene.It is interesting to note that if two actors have a close rapport then their performance reflects this very well.In "Tunes of Glory" a number of scenes were cut that had both actors in it. I remember one scene Still had Jock and Mary in bed together. Maybe it was deemed unnecessary and the censor would have made it an "A" movie instead of a "U".I would greatly appreciate any comments you may have concerning these two actors as I am writing a book about British Film Actresses and a large section will be devoted to Kay Walsh.Thank you,MCG</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as much changes as we like to think.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a hint of J. B. Priestley in Mr. George Bird. It was during the Great War that the future great writer felt a prompting to live beyond merely existing. "Last Holiday" endures as another of Mr. Priestley's gifts, this on celluloid. It is amusing how often the young are surprised when the past speaks to them with relevance. It has always been that the young believe everything changes and that generations grow wiser. "Last Holiday" does its small part in presenting a timeless theme and with the taste and simple earnestness lost on too many contemporary artists. The subject could easily have tipped toward farce or to maudlin sentimentality; and the denouement might well have presented today's filmmaker with another opportunity to preach a sermon to the wealthy. The characters portrayed in "Last Holiday" are not cut from one cloth, despite all but the help having the advantages secured by wealth and prestige. They run the gambit from the snob to the benevolent of spirit, just as do real people, as contrasted against the one-dimensionality of those portrayed in James Cameron's patently untrue and nasty "Titanic." The cast members of "Last Holiday" are giants in their skill, as are those who assembled this miniature masterwork. As if to leave one final trace of George Bird's creator, the cold irony of the ending seems to reflect a sentiment once expressed by J.B. Priestly: "Accidents, try to change them - it's impossible. The accidental reveals man."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughtful Tale of Irony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes a film good? In this case it's the writing that first draws you in. Writer and co-producer J.B.Priestly (The Old Dark House '32 ~ An Inspector Calls '54) has a way with words that compels the viewer to want to know more about his characters. With wit and a sense of mystery, he surrounds us with multi layered groups of people that are mostly drawn together by chance. In 'Last Holiday' the cruel hand of fate brings us face to face with ultimate irony.It's filled with marvelous situations, at first upsetting, then wryly funny, leading to an unexpected ending that invites us to examine the way we not only relate to others, but how we treat them. Priestly is examining the bias that all too often accompanies class consciousness. The cast is exquisitely diverse, everyone from bit players to mains, deliver sterling performances under direction from Henry Cass (Glass Mountain '49). Welsh born Cinematographer: Ray Elton (Quartet '48) with his strong grounding in documentaries, brings a realistic look to the fine work of Scottish art director Duncan Sutherland (San Demetrio London '43 ~ The Human Monster '49). I found the music score by Romanian born composer Francis Chargrin surprisingly melodic for a 50s film of this type. Its thoughtful main theme is equally likable as his later 'The Beachomber' in '54. You might also remember Chargrin for his 'Colditz Story' '55, and 'Grey Friars Bobby' '61. Those who enjoy the always professional performances of Alec Guinness will enjoy his generally dour role in this off-beat mini classic.My viewing was hindered by Australian TV broadcaster Gem's, persistence in supering 'pop-up' adds for up-coming shows, and their ridiculous LARGE lolly 'Pink' station ID. At least this time they screened the full film after inadvertently leaving out a reel in an earlier screening! Sure wish this broadcaster would treat their viewers, and the films they run with far more respect!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Living every day as if its the last day of your life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zorba the Greek spoke about meeting a 90 year old man who lived each day as if he would never die, while he himself lived as if he would die any minute. While it really comes down to meaning the same thing, everybody who lives life to the fullest finds different circumstances and reactions. Alec Guennis plays a milquetoast clerk lacking in life behind him, but in facing impending death, he heads out for a spree, checking into a residential hotel, being labeled a "mystery man", which brings him great prestige among the workers and clients. The men who reside in the hotel consult him as if he was a member of the House of Lords, the women come to think of him in romantic terms, and the staff take hold of his wisdom concerning the working man being mistreated.This sly subtle comedy is a gentle hearted view of British society, its attitudes towards the whole stiff upper lip mentality, and how social image can influence how certain members of society are dealt with when assumptions take prevalence over the truth. Guennis, making his low-key performance seem so much different than anything he's ever done, is of course, brilliant. While this is an overused phrase concerning great actors in their best performances (they make it look so easy), here his vocal tone and mannerisms are nowhere close to his usual style. An amazing cast of a plethora of British actors bring much humor to the dour theme. You may not be able to smile with a stiff upper lip, but you can still vibrate them, and that stiff upper lip won't prevent you from crying at the surprising conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm commenting as a devotee of both Alec Guiness and of British post-WWII cinema, and once again I must be the skunk at the garden party of positive reviews here. I was very disappointed. The movie's premise was heavy-handed and it was all too easy to see where things were headed. Subtlety was not in evidence, as the film's point is hammered home over and over again with a sledgehammer, no less. On the positive side it is always wonderful to see this roster of great British actors, and the film is a marvelous look at the intricacies of the British class system (take particular note of regional accents). But nothing rings true; all is contrived. And the pace is, as a previous user commented, absolutely leaden. Guiness, who I revere, seems here to sleepwalk through his role. Recommended only to really serious fans of postwar British cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Told he has only months to live due to an illness, a man decides to spend his final days at a posh hotel. This enjoyable if lethargically paced comedy-drama is well acted by a large cast. Guinness, playing the sort of role he often played in the early 1950s, is perfectly cast as the poor chap who has lived an uneventful life but finds himself immensely popular just when his days are numbered. The fine British cast includes Bernard Lee, the actor who would go on to play "M" in the James Bond movies. The film builds slowly and grows on the viewer, but the ending is needlessly contrived, undermining the earlier developments.</fullReview>

When the results come back George is told he is suffering from a fatal disease, so he quits his job and travels to a posh hotel to enjoy the time left to him. He makes quite an impression on the guests and staff at the hotel, he keeps himself to himself and this makes him an object of great curiosity.He is befriended by the hotels housekeeper Mrs.Poole (Kay Walsh)a woman who has seen much in her life. George discovers that Sir Trevor Lampington(Ernest Thesiger)the doctor who his disease is named after is staying at the hotel too and decides to talk to him about his disease, he isn't prepared for what Lampington will tell him.The film is very funny but has some deeply moving moments too, the slap in the face shocking ending will stay with you long after the film is over.

		<shortDescription>Great comedy, drama and look at human nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For as great a film as "Last Holiday" is, it's probably not for everybody. That dawned on me in reading the few reviews of people who didn't rate it very highly. I don't mean to criticize such viewers, or to put down anyone who may not appreciate or enjoy the same things that I do. It's simply to observe ? again, from these few reviews, that some people may not like this type of sophisticated comedy. Comedy of a demure nature is an especially early type of British humor. It often employs very subtle tongue-in-cheek dialog. And it often requires reading between the lines. Some reviewers also saw the ending as unfortunate. This is not a comedy with slapstick, pratfalls, crazy antics, or even lots of witty dialog. Rather, it is a comedy of human nature, interwoven with drama and romance in a wonderful study and expose of presumption, stereotypes and prejudice. Lastly, it is one other thing which some may not have noticed. "Last Holiday" is a very pert satire of the upper class and well-to-do. And, it seems to me that it also takes a stab at the English medical system. This is a brilliant screenplay and it has superb directing, editing and technical aspects. All of the cast in this wonderful British film are excellent. What a diverse bunch of characters. Alec Guinness plays George Bird, around whom the entire story unfolds. Although he was 36 years-old when he made this film, Guinness was fairly new to the silver screen. He began his acting career on the stage in the mid-1930s, and served in the Royal Navy in World War II. After the war, he returned to the stage, and then in 1946 had an opportunity to play the role of Herbert Pocket in the David Lean production of Charles Dickens's "Great Expectations." He gave an excellent performance in that minor role, and then excelled as Fagin in the 1948 production of Dickens's "Oliver Twist." By the next year, 1949, Guinness firmly established himself as an outstanding actor. He played eight separate roles, with memorable lines of dialog, voice changes and considerable makeover in "Kind Hearts and Coronets." It's one of the best crime comedy films ever made. The only person to appear in more roles in one film was Buster Keaton in a 1921 silent short, "The Play House." But the bulk of his two dozen characters were simply film shots with no lines. It may be true that the younger generations today only know Alec Guinness from his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi in the first three of the Star Wars films (1977, 1980 and 1983). But any movie buff will know Guinness more for his many earlier films and outstanding roles. Besides his Oscar performance in "The Bridge on the River Kwai," (1958), Guinness won awards or was nominated for Golden Globe, BAFTA, or Emmy awards in "The Lavender Hill Mob" of 1951, "The Horse's Mouth" of 1958, "Startime" of 1959, "Little Dorrit" of 1987, and "Smileys People" of 1982. He is the only actor in the line of Star Wars films to be nominated for an Oscar. And, he had superb roles in a host of other outstanding movies, in both comedies and dramatic roles. Others describe some of the story and action in "Last Holiday." I won't say anymore to give away the plot. But I think the final scene was perfect for this story. By the smile on his face, I think George Bird wouldn't have it end any other way. Perhaps others sensed a message as well. See if you do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless story and wisdom about the plays of life and death.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this film it made an impression for life, and it still does, its story belonging to timelessness in its simple but all-encompassing wisdom displaying almost a documentary about the facts of life and death, how to relate with them when it comes to a crisis and how unfathomably and relentlessly it will reveal yourself when everything is put on an edge. It's J.B.Priestley's most brilliant story that couldn't have been better realized than by Alec Guinness (in perhaps his finest and most sensitive acting ever on film) and Kay Walsh managing to make a heart of gold convincing under a hard surface of obviously too much hard experience. All the guests at the hotel add to the fantastic setting of an ideal community brought together by the mysterious crisis, that everyone feels but no one can understand, probably even less when destiny strikes home and reveals the full unalterable truth - when all the cards are on the table, everyone is even more at a loss than when they were wandering lost in a mystery. This is a beautiful film for all times and ages with a story that could have been written by an aged and saged Oscar Wilde in its profound brilliance of wit and invention. The key to the whole thing is set from the beginning by the strange detail of the blind fiddler - Alec Guinness' reaction when the surprise is repeated is unforgettable, and his long face couldn't be more convincing. The film is full of details like this, though, and each time you see it, you make more delightful discoveries. Perfect story, perfect psychology, perfect and unforgettable display of how the whims of destiny make fools of us all - with perhaps something learned on the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the film that I have watched the most times. It if full of social comment for the late 1940s and early 1950s. The richness of character and the subplots centred around a group of hotel guests, bring to life what otherwise might be a predictable plot. I never tire of it.Sid James gets a chance to shine through as the great character actor he was and in no way stands in the shadow of, the distinguished, Alec Guinness.Not only is social comment explored but the post-war class system. When the lower class Guinness arrives at the hotel an upper class type describes him as a 'counter jumper who took a lucky dip in a football pool'. It's a throw away comment yet superb. That of dismissive attitude, knowing your place and that new money has no entitlement with old.The hotel manager bridges the gap across the class of his guests while the working class Sid James is not phased by his 'fish out of the water environment' - unlike Guinness who is dogged by feelings of not belonging. Guinness makes friends with all the guests, irrespective of their backgrounds, they build him up, smash him down and then are smashed down themselves.It's well worth watching. I love it. And watch out for the mention of cousins - most of the hotel guests appear to have one or two they make reference to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reminiscent of Grand Hotel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot see that any previous mention has been made of the fact that the character played by Alec Guiness is very similar to that played by Lionel Barreymore in "Grand Hotel".Barreymore played a character with a terminal illness who decides to spend his last days in a Grand Hotel and wins large sums at a casino in an ironic touch.In this film we are stuck with the silly twist ending.Whilst there is a very good cast generally speaking this film is very pedestrian.Since many of the reviews are from America they have missed the swipe at the unions taken by the film makers.The unions were starting to exert a stranglehold on British industry which would become a true nightmare in the 1950s until Thatchers legislation put a thankful stop to it."Sympathy"strikes were all the rage.The film unions were notorious for their militancy at the time.Hence the somewhat unlikely strike by the hotel workers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful...one of Sir Guinness' best! Much better than the 2006 remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the original...Sir Alec Guinness' original version is much better than Queen Latifah's 2006 remake, though that version is also a fun movie. I've seen a fair amount of Sir Guinness' movies, and I find this one of his best.As someone with a life-threatening disease for the past 24 years, this film is an inspiration for me to keep facing every new day, no matter what the prospects I've faced in the ups and downs.God bless Guinness (the actor and the liquid inspiration, in moderation!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Characters/relationships needed more time to develop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I would recommend the movie. It was certainly made enjoyable largely because of the fun (and very British) characters, and although the premise of the film (which I won't go into) seemed rather predictable, I'm sure it was far less so back in 1950. I found it pleasant and amusing; however, I couldn't give the film more than 6/10.My main problem is that the film tried to pack too much in, and make things move fast enough to keep the film only 90 minutes. As such, I enjoyed the characters in a superficial way but couldn't feel any real deep emotional connection with either them as believable people or as believable relationships with one another or the main character (I don't want to give anything away so I'm being vague). As this was the foundation and the driving element of the plot, I came away somewhat empty.If the film were 1/2 hour longer, so that more time had been dedicated toward building up the characters and their relationships, I would have liked this film much more. As is, it was fun but forgettable.</fullReview>
