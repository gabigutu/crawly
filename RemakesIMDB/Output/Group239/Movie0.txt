		<shortDescription>Cute movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed this movie. Yes the plot has been done many times before. As with most romantic comedies, it's nothing deep, had some cheesy moments and was totally predictable (I figured out the whole movie in the first 10 minutes). But I really enjoyed it all the same. I laughed a lot in this movie. Partly because I could totally relate to trying to live life under the radar as woman that doesn't look like a model. Plus it was refreshing to see an African American woman shown with some depth in a movie. Not just the mean black woman.There was very little cussing, little sexuality, and no nudity. Truly refreshing these days. If you just want to enjoy a movie without having to put too much thought into it, go see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Optimistic movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie to be highly enjoyable. It had all the right ingredients (pun intended) of a classic "feel good" movie. In a generation full of hectic rush and non stop "mean-ness," this movie was a little ounce of what we need more in the world; optimism. "Live life to the fullest." Unfortunately that theme isn't common nowadays. There doesn't seem to be one part of this movie that isn't enjoyable. There's just the right amount of humor that allows Queen Latifa to shine as a comedian as well as heart in her performance which makes you care for and relate to this character. I hope this movie receives a lot of credit and praise despite the timing of its release. I applaud the actors and the especially the writers for making such a happy movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin Movie Show review - adorable and enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no idea I would enjoy myself so much! Queen Latifah plays Georgia Byrd, a shy, quiet, insecure frump, with a secret passion for cooking and for her co-worker, Sean (the most endearing character that L.L. Cool J. has ever played!). After hitting her head and suffering a concussion, Georgia has a cat-scan that reveals several brain tumors. With less than a month to live, Georgia takes all the money she has and treats herself to the European vacation of a lifetime. She flies first class, stays in the Presidential suite, eats the finest food, and lives like she was dying. "Last Holiday" is pure fantasy and pure fun, and it never takes death too seriously. Gerard Depardieu plays the delightful world-famous Chef Didier who equates Georgia's appetite for food with an exquisite appetite for life. "The meaning of life," he tells her, "is butter." So go treat yourself to this fun little film, get a large popcorn, and don't skip on the butter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our audience applauded at the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, "Last Holiday" is not an Oscar contender, but it is an uplifting and well-made film. Georgia, the main character played by Queen Latifah, was living a very dull and boring life and suddenly, she realized that there was more to life than working all day and eating microwave dinners. She was a woman who followed her dreams. Timothy Hutton is a wonderful villain and LL Cool J plays his heartthrob role very well. The Czech Republic provided a gorgeous (albeit COLD) backdrop. Yes, some of the plot points are implausible, but who cares? The scenery - and Queen Latifah's wardrobe - were breathtaking and most important, this movie was ENTERTAINING and these days, there are very few films that you can say that about. At the performance I attended, there were about 200 people in the audience and we all applauded at the end of the film. Go see it for a good laugh!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie because i had already seen all the other movies playing in the theater and i was actually very surprised with how good this movie was! i really enjoyed it, i enjoyed the script, the story, the acting, the characters and although it was semi predictable as is any romantic comedy, it definitely kept me on my toes, i really enjoyed it. Queen Latifah definitely knows how to pick a good script. I gave the movie an 8 out of 10 because although it's not particularly my type of movie, i really did enjoy it.I recommend taking the whole family to see this one, or a date, it would even be a fun movie to take your mom to go see!One thing i suggest, don't go into this movie hungry because there is a lot of delicious looking food in it. My mouth was watering the entire time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie will make you feel good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film with my mom, and we both loved every minute of it. In fact, I'm pretty sure everyone loved it, because it was one of the only movies that everyone clapped at the end. Although it was often silly and predictable, it was absolutely hysterical and had a lot of heart.Georgia Byrd (Queen Latifah), a worker at a supermarket, is a normal, shy and reserved person. She's afraid to talk to the guy she loves (Sean, played by LL Cool J), and she never does anything exciting. Within the first 15 minutes, you see her cook a wonderful looking meal which she cooked along with the show "Emeril", in which she takes a picture of and gives to her neighbor. She in turn eats a Lean Cuisine. These greatly affect the establishment of her character, so I give props to the writers.She later hits her head and learns that she has a terminal disease and is going to die in 3 weeks. She is very sad at first, and goes back to her normal life for a day or two, when she finally looks at her possibilities book (a book with all the things she wish she would have eaten, vacations she wanted to go on, and fake pictures of her marrying Sean), and decides to go to the "Grandhotel Pupp" and live up her last three weeks.Once at the hotel, she sees the senator of Louisianna (who was supposed to attend her church service) and Congressman Kragen, the owner of the chain of shops that she works at. She also meets the hotel staff, ranging from a mean housekeeper to a kind chef she had wanted to meet. That is where the humor really starts.She completely splurges, getting the nicest room in the hotel and getting orders of everything in the restaurant, making everyone think she is a very important person. She also manages to get many different spa treatments and do many exciting things including snowboarding and base jumping.You get all the humor of a typical Queen Latifah movie, with a lot of heart that will make you love the movie even more. The drama isn't really extremely big, but it really makes you enjoy the movie more. The best part of the movie, in my opinion, is when Georgia says "Next time... we will laugh more, we'll love more; we just won't be so afraid.". It makes you appreciate life and enjoy the movie. You will laugh, you may even cry, but you will leave the theater with a smile on your face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nice feel-good movie comedy that had me laughing and crying at different parts. Fantasy but everyone could relate. It rings as true, or could be true in a positive way. Queen L. carries the show as a hardworking everyman who is good at her job but finds out she only has 3 weeks to live. She decides to take her money and spend it all on the ultimate vacation before she dies. Timothy Hutton is a believable jerk who plays his part as the owner of the company just right without overdoing it. Latifah runs into Hutton and his rich friends who don't know who this mystery woman spending all the money is at the luxury resort but Latifah shows that she has more class than all of the rich guests put together. I hope this movie turns into a big word of mouth success at the box office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Feel Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Currently, we have our fair share of pointless actions films (absent of any plot and decent script) or films that are trying to take themselves too seriously or films that are too dark and downbeat or films which try to be funny but are not so it was a pleasure to go with my family recently to see Last Holiday.Queen Latifah comfortably heads a cast who delivered solid, believable performances across the board (and some new faces to me). OK, the story was a bit contrived and some sequences were a bit far fetched (the snow board ride for instance) but it was a great deal of fun.The story, which looked at people's aspirations and dreams and the need to take every day as it comes, to enjoy life to the full (as we don't know what is round the corner) was played out with great passion and skill. Latifah's comedy acting (loved the raised eyebrow and sideways glances) was relaxed and easily won over the sympathy of the audience. Great, also, to see Gerard Depardieu again as I haven't seen him for a while.Refreshingly set in snowy Prague, good Direction and lovely Cinematography. I recommend that you see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly delightful romantic comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie! Its a nice, light movie to start out the New Year and clear away those post-holiday blues! Treat yourselves, forget about your troubles for 2 hours and see this film! It was much better than I thought it was going to be and I found myself smiling at the end. The audience clapped when the credits started rolling if that gives you any indication. Queen was stunning and so was the scenery. The cast of characters were funny enough, and the hotel setting was so elegant; makes you just want to hop on a plane to Prague! This movie will probably never be nominated for an award, but who cares! It was fun and sometimes that's what going to the movies should be about; especially given all the heavy hitters nominated for Golden Globes this year... Yikes, talk about depressing! I would say this movie may be more appealing to women. So, ladies call your best friends, take your mom, sisters, nieces and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Queen Latifah play Georgina Byrd, a New Orleans saleswoman who learns that she only has a few weeks to live, so she decides to use her remaining time to take a dream vacation to a European resort. Once there, she starts taking on all sorts of risks and challenges because she really has nothing to lose.Last Holiday is clearly not an Oscar worthy film but it is an enjoyable one and one that's hard to hate. The premise is pretty depressing yet optimistic at the same time. Georgia is a hardworking, quiet and hopeful girl. In the beginning of the movie, she lives a dull existence until she hits her head and finds out she is going to die in two weeks. After this, she decides to live life to the fullest. She doesn't want to be scared of the world anymore. For her final two weeks, she decides to fly to a fancy hotel in Prague she has always dream of going to. This raises the question if you need to have a lot of money to really live life to the fullest. It seems a little too much for me but everyone would want to spend their last two weeks differently. For those expecting a movie like the original, forget it. The original had an effective twist at the end and it was more social commentary than escapist humor. This version is more escapist humor but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie just not as effective as the original.What really makes Last Holiday something is Queen Latifah. She offers a dazzling and enjoyable performance as Georgia. Her character is really hard to hate as well. LL Cool J plays Sean and he likes Georgia but he is kind of afraid to make a move. LL Cool J's performance is actually a little weak so it's a good thing that he didn't get a lot of screen time. Tim Hutton was pretty good as the bad guy. Alicia Witt was okay, a little bland though. There were some other supporting characters that were funny like Susan Kellerman as Gunther.Despite the film's good nature and warm feelings, it was still too cheesy at times. Apparently, everyone at the hotel is living an uneventful life. However, just watching Queen Latifah have fun is enough for them to change their own lifestyles. I thought it was a little cheesy that she was able to touch everyone at the hotel. I also didn't like the fact that Wayne Wang kept the film too safe. His vanilla like directing prevented the movie from really breaking out. The screenplay was okay just not very original and kind of generic. In fact, if Queen Latifah were not present then the whole film would have been forgettable. Last Holiday proves she is an effective actress when given the right material. In the end, this warm, good spirited movie is worth checking out if you like Queen Latifah. Rating 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light comedy served with warmth, intelligence, and freedom for malice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of two marvelous feel good flicks that mark the early crop of 2006 film releases (the other is "Glory Road"). Queen Latifah (in her 25th film since debuting in Spike Lee's "Jungle Fever") glows with warmth, dignity, gentle confidence and a fine comic sensibility as the central character, Georgia Byrd, a salesclerk in a New Orleans chain discount supermart, who learns she will soon die of a rare brain disease.She scares up all the cash she can in order to blow it on a luxury dream trip to a Swiss ski chalet, where she meets a variety of locals and some powerful folks from back home. All sorts of clichéd characters pop up here (a groveling, mistake prone east Indian physician; an austere prison-matronly hotel maid; a porcine four star French chef, an avaricious corporate CEO, a Senator for sale, and on and on).Each one is held up for humorous dissection, but the laughs are never purchased at the price of either stupidity or malice. Be sure to stick around till the end, when, before the final credits, there are priceless still photos of the players with text about their fates. With terrific turns by LL Cool J, Gerard Depardieu, Timothy Hutton, Giancarlo Esposito, Alicia Witt, Susan Kellerman and Ranjit Chowdhry. Judged within the light comedic genre, this one gets an A.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually ended up watching the DVD of this movies 3 times and I smiled throughout the film and laughed each time. So far everyone who watched it with me also came away thoroughly enjoying this movie. And what a surprise Queen Latifah was. She's a very talented actress. Her Character was sweet, charming and strong. The acting was uniformly good. These are the kind of positive role models that are missing from black films. LL Cool J was also a surprise although not as skilled an actor. It was also very interesting to see a place I had never heard of and to discover that the Grand Hotel Pupp really exists.I'll bet the jet set will end up going to the Czech Republic now</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last Holiday wasn't quite the laugh out loud comedy I expected but it definitely was worth watching. It doesn't try to be complex but rather focus's on the main character, her caring attitude, and her adventures on her "Last Holiday." It makes for a cute, fun little movie without being too intelligent. It's just fun to watch.Queen Latifah plays Georgia Byrd, an introverted, soft spoken retail salesperson who's never done anything for herself and prefers to just dream about what could be. But when she is told she has three weeks to live everything changes and she realizes if she doesn't open up now she'll never get the chance and she takes a wild holiday with the last of her money and does everything she always wanted to but was too scared to do. Along the way her sweet, innocent personality touches the lives of some unusual people. Latifah is great and although I think she is the exact opposite of Georgia Byrd in real life, she is easily convincing as her in the film. She does have a great personality and it shines in the film and she is perfect in the role. LL Cool J plays her dream man Sean Matthews who she is always afraid to approach but he'll come looking for her when he discovers he may not get to tell her about his own feelings towards her. He's not in the film a lot but LL Cool J is a very versatile actor and comedy seems to come naturally to him and him and Latifah are adorable together. Timothy Hutton is good as Latifah's nemesis at the resort she stays at, Matthew Kragen. Kragen is threatened and jealous by the attention that the free spirited Georgia receives from his peers and looks to outsmart her but even Georgia's spirit will touch him. Alicia Witt plays Hutton's secretary/girlfriend who Georgia befriends in an attempt to help her out of her less than stellar life. She also does a good job. Gérard Depardieu plays a small role as the chef of the resort who Latifah makes a connection with as a fellow food connoisseur. His role could have been bigger as he is a comedy natural but the film really centers on and is all about Latifah and her character.I might say the comedy was a little more subtle than I expected but that has been directors Wayne Wang's style and perhaps I should have noticed that. Much of the really good scenes are already long shown in the trailer, it's one of those films where the bulk of it is given away before you've even seen it. Even still Latifah makes the film worth watching and the story is cute and acceptable. It won't blow you away or probably stick with you very long but it won't disappoint either as a light movie snack. Definitely at least worth it for Latifah's performance. It definitely has some laughs and some feel good moments and well worth seeing. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a surprisingly very enjoyable film, that's really quite cute, with an enjoyable story and a wonderful performance from Queen Latifah!. All the characters are cool, and very likable, and I thought the ending was really neat, plus Timothy Hutton is fantastic as the jerk. It's a great feel good story, that will leave you with a smile on your face after you are done watching it, and I thought this pretty well made and written as well, plus Queen Latifah is full of charm!. LL Cool J also adds a lot of fun to the movie, and I thought Latifah's own personal notebook was kind of cute, plus the scenes with her and Gérard Depardieu were very charming. To be honest I wasn't expecting much going into the theater, due to not knowing much about Latifah, and I must say it totally exceeded my expectations! plus the skiing scene involving Latifah is a riot!. Alicia Witt also made a great impression, and while I can see why some may find the ending silly, I personally loved it, plus I am most definitely going to be checking out more of Latifah's stuff now as a result!. This is a surprisingly very enjoyable film, that's really quite cute, with an enjoyable story and a wonderful performance from Queen Latifah, I highly recommend this one for a watch in theaters!. The Direction is great!. Wayne Wang does a great! job here with very good camera work, good angles and keeping the film funny and at a fast pace. The Acting is excellent!. Queen Latifah is wonderful here, she is the movie, and carries it with her charm, it also helps that she's great in Comedy, she also had excellent chemistry with LL Cool J and played a character we care about, I loved her! (Queen Rules!!). LL Cool J is good here, I have always dug him as an actor as he is a lot better then people say he is, and he was good here too I liked him. Timothy Hutton is fantastic as the jerk, he was extremely convincing, and was perfect for this role. Alicia Witt is gorgeous and did great with what she had to do I liked her lots. Gérard Depardieu is fantastic as the chef, and had some great scenes with Latifah!. Giancarlo Esposito is decent as the senator and did what he had to do adequately. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall I highly recommend this for a watch in theaters!. ***1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, the story is predictable. Guess what? Romantic Comedy is like that! If you like romantic comedies, then this one is really good. If you don't, then watch another movie because this is a throwback to the classic romantic comedies of yesteryear. Just like the principal theme of this movie, itself, the thing that makes a romantic comedy good is not the destination, but the journey. It is the characters, the dialog, and the way that boy and girl reach their predictable reunion. It's like you know what's going on in the first 10 minutes, and so you sit back and check out how the script and director and actors get you to your destination in THIS film. Here, the characters are fun to watch. Queen Latifah has that essential quality for a good comedian - she tugs at your heartstrings while the laughter is going on. She is great! LL Cool J is a wonderfully pleasant surprise. Tim Hutton is a good comedy villain: you loathe him - but not too much. (At the end, he seems to experience a change of heart, so I was slightly disappointed at his fate in the Epilogue.) Gerard Depardieu is especially good, and the rest of the cast is fine. My wife and I loved the setting, the cinematography and the fun script. This film made us laugh more than any film in recent memory.One final note - Queen Latifah strikes the perfect chord in this movie. Even in her big New Years Eve response to Hutton, her character is never self-pitying, bitter or self-righteous. Her beauty of character shines through, without a lot of fuss being made over it in the film. It just lets her speak for herself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine the situation that Georgia Byrd has to face. After a cat scan she is told by the doctor she has an incurable disease and that her days are numbered. Anyone learning about a terminal illness must take stock of what is in store and prepare for a quiet death. Well, Georgia, on the other hand, a woman who has tried to lead a good life, foregoing material pleasures, suddenly decides to spend whatever she has doing what she wants before it's too late. She quits her job at a department store where Sean, the man she likes from a distance, also works.Georgia has always dreamed about a fabulous vacation in places she can't afford. That is why the Grand Hotel Pupp is the only place she even contemplates. Located in the Tyrolean Alps, it's a picture perfect place for the rich and famous and since Georgia has come with the idea of enjoying herself, she doesn't mind the expense. After all, she cashed in all her securities for this last fling.At the resort, she doesn't bat an eyelash about expenses. After all, she figures, she'd better pamper herself. Georgia realizes she must update her wardrobe as well and transforms herself into a beautiful creature. The party of Americans staying at the hotel include the senator from her home state of Louisiana and the rich man who owned the store where she worked in New Orleans. Georgia is an instant hit because she is herself all the time. She makes everyone at the hotel like her because they see in Georgia a genuine person.Wayne Wang, the director of this film has always delivered well crafted pictures that are entertaining. This is a film loosely based on the English film of the same title that was a vehicle for Alec Guinnes and J.B. Pristley, the original writer is given credit. The adaptation for this version works out well because it's never meant to be anything more than a light comedy, a bit predictable, perhaps, but it satisfy none the less.Queen Latifah is a natural actress with a lot of charm. She is the basic reason for watching "Last Holiday" because she dominates it with her charming presence. LL Cool J is seen as Sean, her love interest, who doesn't have much to do in the movie. Timothy Hutton plays the mean spirited American millionaire who feels upstaged by a woman who he learns was his employee. Gerard Depardieu plays Didier, a chef that sees in Georgia a kindred spirit. Alicia Witt, Giancarlo Esposito, and Michael Nouri, appear in supporting roles.The winning combination of Wayne Wang with Queen Latifah proves to be irresistible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good romantic comedy, a "feel good movie" (a remake of "Last Holiday" with Alec Guinness from Ealing Studios in 1950), highly recommended for those who want to see a movie about how you can crab every day of your life to make it a great experience. With a predictable plot (how many times we have seen this idea at the past?) but very sincere and enjoyable (althought we hope we 'll see something more interesting from the director of the "Joy LucK Club" and "Smoke" in near future). With good performances from Queen Latifah, Timothy Hutton and an especially amusement cameo from Gerard Depardieu. P.S. Including some very exciting recipes at the end...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Not sure if I would consider any of my comment a spoiler in any way because you can kind of figure out the whole movie by watching the trailer).... Why does movie only have a mid-6 rating? I enjoyed every bit of this movie and thought it was very refreshing. Yes the story has been done before, but not quite this um........endearing. It was her character that was so sweet and so likable. Even when she told people what she thought about them and put them in their place, she did it amicably. I loved watching her do all the things she wanted to do and had listed in her "Possibilities Book". This movie is a good example of when you get the impression from the trailer that it is kind of a silly movie but it ends up being so much more. The movie just made me feel good. That's all. We really don't know how much time we have. Georgia was going to make every last minute count and she did it with style. I loved it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why this movie didn't make a lot of money when it came out. I finally rented it and enjoyed every minute of it. No, it isn't a "film" of Oscar distinction, but is a "movie" with good family fun. It did exactly what it was intended to do. It told me a fun story, with some laughs and some tears but most of all it ENTERTAINED. That's all I can ask from a movie. As long as it entertains me like it should, it doesn't have to be an artsy "film". One of the things I love about the film besides the story was the filming of it. The scenery was breathtaking. I loved how they emphasized the luxuriousness of the luxury hotels and the bleakness of the ghetto. I also loved the camera work on all the action scenes. All in all it was a well made movie. It's just a shame that it only grossed 36.3 million at the box office. I hope it does better on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and Inspirational</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than just being a very funny film, you can't express a much better message in a more positive way than that expressed in Last Holiday. I usually try to not rate on my view of a film's message, and I'm not entirely doing that here, but Wayne Wang, his cast and the writers get across a "live positively and fully in the moment for all it's worth, as if it's your last" message so effectively and inspirationally, and I think it's so worthwhile, that it's difficult to not score this film higher for that reason. At one point in the film someone calls Georgia Byrd (Queen Latifah) the "ultimate existentialist" for living the way she decides to start living. It also has foundations in Zen Buddhism and a few other schools of thought. But whatever philosophical system we might associate with it, it's worth doing, starting right now, and if you need a kick in the pants or a bit of coaxing to get there, there's no better place to start than this film.Still, I can see some people avoiding Last Holiday, and not just people who hate some of these actors. This is a remake, so if you hate those on principle, avoid this one. It is also a bit predictable and formulaic, so if you think that those facts are sufficient to recommend against seeing a film, don't bother with this one. Of course, if you think any of these things, the film's humor and message will probably be lost on you anyway. I don't mind if you grumpily trudge over to the corner and sulk.For the rest of us, Last Holiday is likely to produce a lot of tears. I cried both from laughing so hard and from the more serious dramatic moments. Queen Latifah is excellent as always, and she continues to make extremely intelligent script choices. It's rare for her to be in a dud, artistically, and this is one of her best films to date.Although it is very funny and has the same energy and cutting-edge verve of contemporary "outrageous comedies", Wang and crew are also very careful to keep the film family-safe. This is a film that people of all ages can and should watch. Just be ready to book an adventure trip including lots of extreme sports activities and hedonistic pampering after the credits end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It is easy to watch and enjoy. It just goes to show you, they can make movies without all the cuss words and sexual situations. It is a movie you can really enjoy watching. Pay attention to the background of the hotel. It just makes you want to go there. This is a great movie. Queen Latifah is so smooth. She is elegant. She puts everything in perspective and then acts on it. Her character does what we all do from time to time. Ask God why? But she stays true to herself and everything turns out fine. Faith - it can work miracles - even in real life. I would recommend this movie to anyone old enough to understand how precious life is. And also how short life is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun and enjoyable movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Georgia Byrd (Queen Latifah) lives a small life but has big dreams. When this shy salesperson for a New Orleans retail outlet learns her days are numbered, she throws caution to the wind and embarks on a dream holiday vacation to a grand resort in Europe. LL Cool J also co-stars as one of Georgia's co worker, and he is also her "dream love interest". Georgia has many dreams. She wants to try every kind of dish that is available, she has big dreams of hooking up with her co worker and after bumping her head and finds out she has a kind of disease, she wants to have fun for her last 3 weeks living. After she finds out her days are numbered, it can be touching but here and there will be a few laughs.Now if you do see the trailer for this movie, you obviously know this will be a predictable movie, and all you can say is that you get what you expect. But Queen Latifah delivers such a good performance and I really like her, she makes the movie better. If this movie had a different actress, this movie probably wouldn't be the same.I just really like her and I know she has a lot of other movies.Last Holiday is a fun and an enjoyable movie. It's also a movie that I would like to see again. it was fun,enjoyable,touching and a feel free good movie. In my opinion, people missed out on this movie. I don't think it did well in theaters, but I think people know whats going to happen, but the way it happens isn't what you expect. But maybe people didn't wanna see it because they expected what will happen. I would wanna see this movie again.So I am recommending this movie so that people can have fun. I really found this movie good. So I would give this a movie a 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, here's the truth: My wife wanted to see this movie. The preview looked good and it has Queen Latifah. So last weekend we went to a matinée. I admit I didn't have high expectations but this movie was surprisingly touching and entertaining. The movie explores how important living life to the fullest is. Not a profound theme but handled nicely here. If you listen closely you'll even discover what the "secret of life" is.Queen Latifah knows a good part when she sees one and her scenes with Gérard Depardieu had me smiling. An all 'round feel good movie. And these days, what's wrong with that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has the typical beginnings of a typical Romantic Comedy but after the main Character learns that she is diagnosed with a terminal illness due to a (dog scan) Cat Scan she all of a sudden throws everything to wild abandon since she realizes she has just weeks top live; quits her job, tells all the jerks off, abandons her family and goes to a high profile resort community after she liquidates her retirement money to live it up like no one's business since she has been led to believe that every day might as well be her last.She makes genuine friends at the exclusive hotel where she has taken the executive suite and all the other guests think she is someone she is not including the politician from her region whom she meets and calls out. She lives it up literally thinking every day is her last and makes everyone at the high end hotel love her. She continues to be the life of the party and then the man that she loves from her former job flies down comes to meet her after he learns about her diagnosis and ironically after the maid that was bribed to pry into her bio reads her sad 'if I die from my disease' note turns 180 and in the process turns all the hotel staff on her side. Finally at New Years, ironically the person most intimidated by her audacious live every day by the moment attitude learns who she really is and after his degrading speech she admits he is right but also says she never meant to brag 0r pretend and once she says that she is also suffering from a disease that will kill her any day, everyone at the table abandons him and flock to her.Later on her former company boss from the company she so boldy quit before this fateful trip is on a ledge to jump to his end. She goes up there to console him and the man she loves that flew to see her joins the ledge and proposes to her. She agrees and then the uptight possibly German maid sees the fax document that fell to the floor from the Indian doctor that realized he misdiagnosed her due to a flaw in the machinery.Everyone lives happily ever after.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>She thinks that she is going to die until the doctor finds out that the machine is a little broken so. So thinking she will die she gets a lot of money and buys a fancy hotel room in a fancy hotel where the big shots come to stay. She orders a lot of the fancy and good food, eats at classy restaurants and does stuff that must cost a fortune. In this time she feels she should be spending this with her friends. Just at the second she goes to leave the man she works with and likes comes to the place to find her. The avalanche keeps her back so she goes back to the hotel where he later comes and tells her he loves her. After the rich man has one of the maids go through her stuff she finds out she is going to die and doesn't tell that little rich punk. But at the big New Years dinner he brings up who she really is and she tells them she is going to die. Well then that rich brat feels like well an @$$. So he is sitting on the edge of the building on one of the floors drinking a bottle of wine. She joins him up there and starts to tell him how to change things around the store she used to work for. Then at that moment the man she loves is down there screaming to her. He comes up and he tells her how much he loves her. Then the fax is finally picked up off the floor after it is faxed and not noticed. So the lady that went through her stuff finds it and runs it up to her telling her she is not going to die that the machine was a crock. So everything is good and everyone gets a pretty good ending and she marries her man while base jumping.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching Last Holiday I left the cinema feeling something different, something warm inside. This feeling made me stop and think about what this movie meant. This film can mean so much to so many people all around the world. Queen Latifah explored some new territory in this film and I honestly believe she has come out of it a much better person.The story is simple, a fairly shy young women finds out she has around a month to live, it is only now that she truly starts to live. I am going to go out on a ledge here and state this is the best thing Queen Latifah has ever done (including Chicago)!!! Overall a delightful romantic comedy with a great supporting cast including LL Cool J and Gerard Depardieu truly puts this in my top 10 must see comedies. Well done guys :-)</fullReview>

From the moment the company doctor tells us that the company kept costs down by buying a second hand CAT scan machine you know immediately where this story ends.Yes of course she comes out of her shell, learns to live and gets her man. But lets be honest, if you go into a movie like this expecting any different then you deserve to be disappointed. "Last Holiday" puts a smile on your face and that's all it needs to do.

This is a very warm hearted film to just sit down and enjoy! The movie manages to juggle being both funny and very warm hearted and sweet at the same time, and does it very well. The visuals here are great too, beautiful landscape views! LL Cool J is also very enjoyable here. The movie is very well written, well acted, and is very fun to watch, especially around Christmas time! I love the goings on in the movie, everything just works together very well in Last Holiday! It also teaches a good lesson and pushes a very good message. Live for the day, don't waste any time, you only live once!

		<shortDescription>A Holiday Charm Worth Taking!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last Holiday (2006): Dir: Wayne Wang / Cast: Queen Latifah, L.L. Cool J., Timothy Hutton, Gerard Depardiau, Alicia Witt: Warm and delightful comedy about chances and living. Queen Latifah plays a cook who learns that she has only three weeks to live. She quits her job when her boss refuses to listen to reason, and decides to spend her savings doing everything she always wanted to do. This surprises the wealthy at the hotel she is staying at because of her nature. Setup works due to pacing but structure is formula and predictable. Conclusion demonstrates that happiness transpires from natural things that money cannot necessarily buy. An improvement for director Wayne Wang who previously made the awful Maid in Manhattan. Latifah holds strong playing off innocence as well as the willingness to excel without overshadowing others. L.L. Cool J. plays the standard potential boyfriend. Timothy Hutton plays the stereotypical rich snob who will get put in his place. The only supporting role that seems to elevate is Gerard Depardiau as the famous chef wooed by Latifah's love for food. And how about Alicia Witt as that snide spiteful bitch whom Latifah must give a lesson to on what life is like when you don't act like you're constantly on your period. Technically well made with great location work. Film suggests viewers to live life to the fullest as this is you last holiday. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A missing spark in a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good movie, and I enjoyed Queen Latifah in her starring role as a doomed (well, sort of) character on a final fling. She's a good actress! However, in my view, the film was missing something -- a spark -- the spark of romance. Yes, she and LL Cool J's characters love each other, but we see that in the beginning and end, and almost not at all throughout the main body of the film. I think that was a mistake. It's kinda difficult to have a love story without the two people who are in love being together much.On the other hand, Queen's character did not put Timothy Hutton's boss character down, as she could have, and as some directors and screenwriters would probably have wanted the character to do. But that would have been low class. And here, Queen's character is not low class. Good job director and screenwriter(s).There's little to criticize with the acting here. Not that it's stellar, but it is solid. As already mentioned, Queen does nicely. LL Cool J has matured as an actor since this film; he does okay here, but is not a stand out. Timothy Hutton does nicely as the "villain" here; plays it about right. I don't usually care much for Gérard Depardieu, but he does nicely here as the European chef. And, Alicia Witt does reasonably well as the love interest with Hutton.This could have been a much better film...and probably made a profit...had they played up the love interest more between Queen and LL. But, it is what it is, and I've watched it twice now and enjoyed it both times. A "7", but only barely.</fullReview>

When a CAT scan reveals a terminal illness, she cashes in everything to live it up in Europe at the Grandhotel Pupp where chef Didier (Gérard Depardieu) serves.Queen Latifah exudes charisma and warmth which enlivens this old feel-good formula. It's fun, it's charming, and it's cliché. Timothy Hutton does a sleazy retail magnate. LL Cool J is very personable and sexy. Gérard Depardieu actually has fun acting opposite the Queen.

She takes a stock character and gives it real depth and dimension. Kudos to Alicia.The other supporting players range from adequate to very good. Timothy Hutton, although playing a stereotypical "bad guy," manages to give his character a few good moments.The only let-down, is a comparatively weak ending. Don't get me wrong, the ending is not terrible, and it does wrap up the story, but I can picture several ways it could have been better.All in all, "Last Holiday" is well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about a saleslady in a department store who finds out she has a terminal illness. She decides to spend all her savings to enjoy her remaining days in her dream European resort.I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of "Last Holiday". Despite Georgina's illness, she decides to enjoy her life as much as possible. She becomes liberated, no longer sticking to her miserable routine. She instead jumps out of the box and enjoys life as much as she could. The film is uplifting and cheerful, I find Queen Latifah full of positivity which makes the film work. I applaud her character's positive vibe. There would probably not be any depressed people if everyone thought like Georgia. Chef Didier, played by Gerard Depardieu, is great too, as he and Queen Latifah have great chemistry. It would not feel out of place if the plot says they started a relationship! I very much enjoyed "Last Holiday". It's fun, touching and positive. I hope it will be appreciated by more people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Queen Latifah plays Georgia Byrd, a woman on her "Last Holiday" in this 2006 film also starring Timothy Hutton, Gerard Depardieu, L.L. Cool J, Alicia Witt, and Giancarlo Esposito. Georgia works in the cookware department of a big department store chain. She's incredibly popular with customers, and at home, she keeps a "possibilities" scrapbook with recipes she's cooked copying her idol, Emeril Lagasse, photos of exotic places, and a photo of her married to her dream man (Cool J) who works with her. But her dream of a restaurant, marriage, a family - she's too shy to really go after them. Then she learns that she only has three weeks to live. She cashes in all of her retirement menu and sets off for Prague. There, she entrances everyone she meets and is unafraid to say what she thinks or take chances. Her popularity and attitudes rankle the owner of the store where she worked (Hutton) who is suspicious of her.Queen Latifah is a natural actress who radiates warmth and honesty in her portrayal of Georgia Byrd. Borrowing from "Nothing Sacred" and "Living it Up," the script emphasizes living life for all its worth and not being afraid to take chances.For all its simplicity, "Last Holiday" leaves the viewer feeling very good. It's predictable, somewhat generic, but delightful, with very good performances and the beautiful scenery of Prague as a backdrop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tired Cinematic Premise is Almost Made Bearable by an Impressive Supporting Cast...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LAST HOLIDAY is a rather lame remake of an old Alec Guiness comedy that stars Queen Latifah as Georgia Byrd, a department store employee who finds out she's dying and decides to travel to Europe and blow all her money, not knowing her fantasy man/fellow employee (LL Cool J)has been fantasizing about her as much as she's been thinking about him. This film is so predictable that I could practically recite the dialogue along with the actors. Queen Latifah works very hard at making her Plain Jane character funny and believable, but her performance comes off as forced and annoying. LL Cool J shows solid leading man potential in a thankless role that's a waste of his and our time. There are plot holes you can drive a truck through, but the film does boast an impressive supporting cast including Gereard Depardieu as a world famous chef who befriends Georgia, Giancarlo Esposito as a US Senator from Georgia's hometown, who happens to be vacationing in the same European spot Georgia travels to, where she learns he is in bed with a ruthless, wealthy businessman (a surprisingly effective Timothy Hutton, cleverly cast against type), who is also dealing with a very discontent mistress (Alicia Witt). There's some gorgeous scenery and the supporting cast is fun; however, unless you're a hardcore Queen Latifah fan, I'd pass on this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last Holiday with Queen Latifah reminded me of Doris Day movies--even though the plot twists are more than a bit implausible, you let that slide because you enjoy seeing her reactions and you want things to work out right for her in the end.I especially enjoyed three moments in this film: 1. The Czech hotel bellman rushes up to Queen L and says something terrible has happened. She, being sarcastic, replies something like, "Mr. Kragen has jumped off the hotel roof? The bellman replies, "A pity, but no. He's still on the ledge."2. There's a montage of Queen L receiving various beauty treatments in the hotel spa while the background music is a slowed tempo version of West Side Story's "I Feel Pretty." At one point in the montage, a small spa employee starts beating the bare skin of Queen L with a large bouquet of some kind of green flowers or weeds. You see Queen L's pained reaction, then she takes the bouquet and starts whacking the spa attendant with it, then the spa attendant is shown saying something like, "With love. With love." and continues whacking Latifah with the bouquet but more gently.3. The ending sequence showing what happens to the main characters is hilarious.</fullReview>

If you are a fan of good food, be sure to eat before watching this film or you will be raiding the kitchen.Or, given the qualities of this film, I should say the kitschen. For instance, why call Latifah when Kragen goes out on the ledge? Why not the police or anybody?I appreciate the fact that the Food Channel made the recipes available.

LL Cool J also does a great job playing Georgia's love interest who is just as shy as Georgia (which is ironic considering that they are 2 of the most outgoing rapper/actors).Definitely a great and mature film that will make you laugh and make you cry and most importantly make you appreciate life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A feel good story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the movie was adequate. It wasn't really funny, just mildly humorous. It was more of a feel good story but it hit snags at times and didn't flow incredibly well. Some of the dialogue and actions in certain scenes just didn't seem to fit. I watched it more to see Georgia's carefree attitude and the accomplishment of her dreams more than anything else. Watching Georgia throw caution to the wind and live everyday as if it were her last was the most enjoyable thing about the movie. She did what so many of us want to do: gather a few belongings, cash out everything, and run off to do everything we ever wanted to do. After Georgia heard the fateful yet errant news that she didn't have long to live, she decided to do everything she was afraid to do or to conservative to do. She ate what she wanted to eat, she engaged in dangerous yet fun activities, and she spoke her mind. In the process she positively affected those around her and even made a difference in their lives and her own life. It was a feel good movie about living and loving that was done fairly well.</fullReview>

Brilliant story...a really feel good movie to see with anyone of any age.What I particularly like about the movie is the "travelling" aspect, a different country is shown. It does not gravitate around the US. The audience is taken on a trip of the world, moralistic view points etc. You leave the movie motivated to do something with your life and to live well. It is funny and classic Latifah. She carries herself so well in this movie and you can see the chemistry between the other actors as well. Truly a beautiful movie. A must see</fullReview>

She checks into the Presidential Suite, orders everything on the menu, snowboards, and comes to the attention of the chef and the hotel's powerful American guests: a Congressman, a Senator, a retail magnate, and his mistress.

		<shortDescription>A romantic tearjerker and hilarious comedy all rolled into one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best comedies from 2005, in my humble opinion. Queen Latifah plays a young woman named Georgia whose is stuck working a dead end job that she is over qualified for. In the same store, LL Cool J plays Sean, the sexy co-worker she is in love with. One they, after being prepped by a horny co-worker, Georgia musters up the courage to finally go talk to Sean but then loses courage and backs down from asking him out. The next day, taking her cue, Sean comes to her department and asks her out. In disbelief of what is happening Georgia's gets clumsy and accidentally bumps her head. She is taken to the hospital where they give her a cat scan for safety purpose but discover that she has several tumors in her head and is given 3 weeks to live. To make matters worse her insurance refuses to pay for the operation that might save her life. Desperate, heartbroken and in shock, Georgia then decides to cash in on her IRA, bonds and savings and begins to live out her dreams in a race against time. Gerard Depardieu, Alicia Witt among others co-star in this feel good comedy or sorts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this film. My roommate and I went to a second run theatre to see it as it looked like the best option. Our expectations were not high at all, especially as it looked like a Christmas movie and we were seeing it in May. It was hilarious! It worked better I think than the original simply because it had Queen Latifa's magic in it. She played the character so well and again played to the stereotyped uptight white people. LL Cool J again proved that he should completely forget about his rap/music career and focus on acting. That song with JLO? please. He did a good job in this film though as the love interest. Anyway, it is actually a film that truthfully I do not remember many sections of, they haven't lasted with me. I do know though that at the time, I was very very impressed with the movie and came out of it having laughed and felt good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am rapidly becoming a big fan of Queen Latifah. While some of her movies aren't very good, she always creates a good role. Here she is Georgia Byrd, single and living and working in New Orleans as a sales clerk in a big store. She has a wish book, but doesn't seem to be doing anything about her wishes. Things change quickly when she hits her head at work, is taken to the company doctor who happens to have a newly bought CAT scan machine. He puts her through it and finds out she has a rare form of brain condition and she only has a few weeks to live. Sobered by this news, she quits her job, draws out all her retirement money, and travels to a winter resort in Europe to stay at the hotel where her idol Chef Didier ( Gérard Depardieu) works. That's where the movie really begins.While Georgia never misrepresents herself, the staff and other guests assume she is important and wealthy. Chef Didier is impressed that she orders all 5 of his specials at one meal, and they become fast friends. All this to the consternation of big shot Matthew Kragen (Tim Hutton) who owns the department store Georgia worked for, and not getting the attention he usually does.I've also become a fan of LL Cool J who plays Sean Matthews , Georgia's co-worker who is destined to become her love interest.SPOILERS FOLLOW. As I suspected from the very beginning, the 'used' machine gave a false diagnosis, and Georgia is healthy. But her experience at the European resort opened her eyes, and changed her perspective on life, to live for today and not wait all your life for things to happen. Luck at the gambling table restored her savings, and she and Sean went back to New Orleans to open their very successful restaurant. Chef Emeril Lagassee is a surprise guest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Latifah fine in desultory vehicle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Georgia Byrd is a retail salesclerk who, as she herself puts it, "has lived her whole life in a box." When she receives the devastating news that she has only three weeks left to live, she cashes in her bonds and IRA fund and checks into a $4,000/day suite in a grand hotel in the Czech Republic, determined to indulge in the kind of pampered living she'd shielded herself from all her life.Based on the 1950 film starring Alec Guinness in the lead role, "Last Holiday" provides a showcase for the talented Queen Latifah, who delivers what is probably her most subdued and fully-rounded performance to date. Unfortunately, the praise does not extend to the film itself, which is woefully lacking in the kind of comic energy that would make this sentimental material even remotely palatable. The secondary characters are little more than hollow stereotypes, and the movie relies too much on lowbrow slapstick when highbrow wit is what is really called for. It also becomes smug and self-satisfied towards the end, providing sappy little lessons in life that are trite and not really all that inspirational.There are a few genuine laughs in the film and the scenery will knock your eyes out. But apart from Ms. Latifah lighting up the screen as the divine Miss Georgia, there's not much reason to check into this two-star, somewhat less-than-grand hotel called "Last Holiday."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie-watching experience and message of Last Holiday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As seen on the previews, Last Holidayis a movie about a woman who lives her life as if she is waiting for a better one to come along. She is diagnosed with a fatal medical issue just after being acquainted with her crush. She realizes that three weeks is all she has to live, so she travels to her dream city and do what she has longed to do. As it can be expected, Queen Latifah is misdiagnosed. Although this movie has some humor, it is not the best movie I have ever seen. I believe that the movie, as corny as it may be, had a strong message: Live not as you have tomorrow, but instead live as though you only have today. Because of the message it conveys, the movie-watching experience is not completely wasted, but instead slightly enjoyed.</fullReview>

This is the movie that Fun with Dick and Jane wanted to be!Latifah's performance as shy frugal worker bee suddenly confronted with imminent mortality was to a tee. She was perfect. Also featured were Timothy Hutton as a greedy narcissistic businessman, Gerard Depardieu as the chef at the trendy European spa she heads for. Giancarlo Esposito as a greasy US Senator and LL Cool J was cool as the hunky love interest.It was a good little romantic comedy. Not original, so little is, I mean it's really boy meets girl, boy loses girl etc. but done freshly. And of course my test for a comedy is, did I laugh and how much. And I did, a bunch.Okay, not as funny as The Aristocrats, but you can take your kids or your mother to see Last Vacation and have a good time, and that's somethin'.This is K PIGThis is KYNS</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last Holiday lacks anything resembling wit, humour, or heart, and meanders along while tripping over its own feet. Watching a dullard is pointless, watching a romance with no chemistry is irritating, watching horrible random slapstick (the snowboarding) is painful, and watching Queen Latifah laboriously marvel at mundane everyday things with a goofy grin is unbearable. The writing for this thing was absolutely atrocious. Presumably the point of such a movie is to be uplifting, but this was pedestrian and pointless. Just one last thing - why does Queen Latifah criticise staff and make a furore on the plane, and then turn into a hypocrite and jump down Alicia Witt's throat for lambasting a masseuse?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Latifah plays this nice and hardworking but lonely employee, finds out she has an incurable disease and decides to make one last dash for it in some glitzy East-European ski resort.OK, why did I start to watch this ? Mainly because it seemed to hold some interest due to the rather original setting (for a US movie anyway)and with a cast including Timothy Hutton and Gerard Depardieu.But alas, my worst fears were confirmed. Of course with the lead role to the extremely annoying "Queen" Latifah this was no surprise. All tired Hollywood clichés are covered and in line with todays political correctness, showing most of the white actors as greedy and stupid and all the colored ones as incredibly smart and noble.I must admit I only managed to get halfway this movie as the lame plot ,the loudmouthed and self-indulging Latifah just proved too much for me. Expecting that it would turn out she was not dying at all, Hutton (as the greedy millionaire) would get his comeuppance and she would marry LLCool in the end . And that, apparently judging from the other reviews, is exactly what happened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enough people have gone over the premise of this movie and I saw the trailers when it first came out in late 2005. I didn't get around to seeing it until Easter 06 when it was recommended by a family member.To be honest I found the 'baddies' rather cheesy, the storyline predictable and love interest in LL Cool J played something of a sideshow. We watched it in the evening and by the time the movie ended only two of the original twelve had sat through it. That spoke volumes....in terms of romantic comedies I think you are far better off watching something along the lines of Bridget Jones' Diary. To be quite honest I'm surprised the reviews on here have been so favourable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 'Last Holiday' Queen Latifah plays Georgia Byrd, a woman who has big dreams. But she has never tried to make those dreams a reality. So when she finds out that she only has two weeks to live; she decides to make some changes in her life. She is about to turn those dreams into reality.This is a fun movie with a good message. People should enjoy life while they have it. I am not a big fan of Queen Latifah nor did I like her in 'Chicago' (where she was nominated for an Oscar). However, I thought she did an awesome job in this movie. I am not saying it was an Oscar worthy performance. But, it was really good. This is probably one of her best performances. I also really liked Gérard Depardieu as Chef Didier.Overall, not a bad film, not my kind of film. The only real trouble with it was that there too many events that occurred that just were not believable. I would have to say Georgia Byrd had to be the luckiest person alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Latifah's latest effort a cute, entertaining diversion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally published on Jan. 10, 2006:You may have begun to think that after such flops as "Taxi," "Bringing Down the House," "Beauty Shop" and "Barber Shop," Queen Latifah's film career peaked with her Oscar- nominated performance in "Chicago" in 2001. That opinion may change a little after viewing her latest effort, "Last Holiday," a cute comedy about a dying woman who goes on a spending spree during her last few weeks on Earth.Basically, it's a remake of the 1950 Alec Guinness film (he was better), as well as Jerry Lewis' "Hook, Line &amp; Sinker" (1969) in which he runs up thousands of dollars in expenses following a terminal diagnosis.Latifah is Georgia Byrd, a quiet, single, New Orleans woman who works as a sales representative in the cookware department of a local department store. She's always dreaming of a better life, as well as the affections of a co-worker, Sean Williams (LL Cool J).She's lonely and shy, and even keeps a book of "Possiblities" in which she places notes and photos of her fondest desires. An accidental bump on the head, though, causes her cautious world to come tumbling down as an MRI reveals that she has the fatal "Lamingham's Disease," a previously undiagnosed malady that gives her just three weeks to live.Faced with her own upcoming mortality, and the fact that she has salted away a considerable sum of cash, Georgia decides to take the trip of her dreams, the Grandhotel Pupp in Czechoslovakia.There, she somehow charms her way into the hearts of a U.S. senator (Giancarlo Espisito, "Derailed"), a congressman (Michael Nouri, "The Terminal"), a world famous chef (Gerard Depardieu), and the mistress of the department store's owner (Alicia Witt, "The Upside Of Anger").Only the sleazy mogul, Matthew Kragen (Timothy Hutton, Oscar-winner for "Ordinary People") sees through her, but she bungles through, excelling at snowboarding ? even though she has never done it before ? and bank-jumping off a huge dam. Finally, Sean (who somehow had enough cash on hand to do so) makes the Transatlantic journey to find his beloved, about the same time as her doctor, Gupta (Ranjit Chowdhry), discovers some important news. Premise is pretty silly, considering Georgia is only given three weeks to live (which seems a pretty short duration), plus, she seemingly has an endless supply of funds for a department store sales rep.In one particularly ridiculous scene, she complains about flying economy class, asks how much it costs to be in first class, and, in the next scene, is flying up front. The slapstick sequences (including Georgia hurling down a ski slope out of control and wiping out Kragen and a dozen others) are also pretty lame.Overall, though, the film is basically harmless, silly and entertaining. It won't win any awards, but it is a decent diversion for January, and that's not such a bad thing.</fullReview>

It is essentially a remake of the 1991 made for T.V. movie "Chance of a Lifetime" starring Betty White (in Queen Latifah's role) and Leslie Nielsen.The dialogue and writing are different, as is the setting for the actual vacation that Georgia Byrd takes. Betty White's character vacations in Mexico after her diagnosis, whereas Queen Latifah's character vacations in Europe.If you have already seen Chance of a Lifetime, as most Betty White fans have, then you already know the ending and majority of the story line.</fullReview>

It's what you like to watch in a quiet night in by the fire, eating a box of Paula's chocolates whilst stroking your westie (I'm glad that's not a euphemism!) It's likable and very enjoyable and doesn't offer too much slushy romance, but it's there!"Last Holiday" doesn't offer any outrageous belly laughs, but just a few chuckles along the way. Queen Lafitah's (real name?) round face cutely dominates the screen, you can't help but enjoy her cuddly presence. You can see what is going to happen from just reading about the plot. It's all set out on a plate for you (no pun intended) and the ending just might make you be sick a little bit, but also fill you with warm joy.The screenplay tries to deal with irony and I think that it does sort of think it's being clever, when anyone with a brain cell could've laid out this plot. A big shock would be if they all fell off the ledge at the end, but obviously they don't! It's predictable like I said and also quite likable.in short you can see everything coming at you like a bus! But unlike a raging bus flying towards you it's nice and leaves you feeling slightly happy. Enjoy my brothers, enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen clips, I assumed it was going to be some kind of humiliation film, everything that could go wrong will go wrong, but I still enjoyed what I saw. Basically department store worker Georgia Byrd (Queen Latifah) bangs her head while flirting with the guy she has a crush on, Sean Matthews (LL Cool J), and her CT scan gives her the shocking news of having untreatable neurological disorder called Lampington's Disease. Knowing she only has three weeks to live, she uses the time she has left to the fullest, taking all her savings out, quitting her job, and heading for her dream vacation in the Czech Republic, in the deluxe Grandhotel Pupp. Checking into the Presidential Suite, ordering everything on the menu prepared by world-renowned Chef Didier (Gérard Depardieu), snowboarding and much more she draws a lot of attention from high earners, including Congressman Stewart (Michael Nouri), Senator Dillings (Giancarlo Esposito), and magnate Matthew Kragen (Timothy Hutton), owner of the store company she worked, with mistress Ms. Burns (Alicia Witt). Meanwhile, Sean is missing Georgia's company, and of course near the end finds out the truth about her CT scan, of course it was a mistake, and they get their happy ending. Also starring Jane Adams as Rochelle, Susan Kellermann as Ms. Gunther, Jascha Washington as Darius and Julia Lashae (one of the highest foreheads I have ever seen) as HMO Administrator. Latifah is so likable that it could have been quite schmaltzy if not for her, it may be predictable in places, but with her and a few good slapstick scenes, it is a good fluffy comedy. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Queen Latifah plays Georgia Byrd, a drab, hopelessly timid, reclusive store clerk with an unheralded talent for cooking and a huge, largely unspoken crush on her co-worker, effectively played by former teen rap star LLCool J. Things begin to change when Georgia is diagnosed with an incurable illness. Told that she has mere weeks to live, Georgia decides to live it up for once in her life, before she dies. Withdrawing her substantial life's savings, she heads off to Europe, transforming herself along the way from nondescript wallflower to assertive blossom that everyone seems magically drawn to. Installing herself in a swanky hotel where she is swathed in luxury for the first time in her life, Georgia naturally learns quite a few things about herself. She acquires a striking new wardrobe, goes snowboarding, indulges in expensive spa treatments and gourmet food. "Last Holiday" is chock full of messages about the seductive power of appearances, cherishing and living every moment of life to the fullest, being true to oneself, yada yada. As such, the movie is almost too sweet and terribly trite, saved only by the infectious charm of Queen Latifah's naturally warm, relaxed screen presence. Unexpected appearances by LL Cool J and Gerard Depardieu also give the picture some amusing heft. Like most movies of its ilk, "Last Holiday" may look and taste good in the short term, but its high saccharine content probably isn't very good for you.</fullReview>

It says you should always live life to the fullest and never take a single day for granted. If you haven't seen it yet please do. It's like a comedy-chick flick all wrapped up into one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What kind of hubris induces folk in Hollywood to dare to think that decades after they can produce hashed up remakes of great Ealing Studios movies while not even aspiring to be as least as good as the original and add elements of today's unfortunate tendency (Soviet sounding) "political correctness"? It's the equivalent of copying the Mona Lisa in a halter top and jeans and giving her a mustache. Tom Hanks' dismal remaking of the Lady Killers and now somebody thinks they can go one better with a remake of Last Holiday.I know people who have seen and enjoyed both remakes without realising that really great originals exist. To anybody else please, please see the originals first. Spoilers are not crucial in the case of The Lady killers but the whole point of Last Holiday is the ending twist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best feel good movie ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last Holiday, after watching the movie I felt really moved. Though predictable, the movie will make any man, woman, or child smile in the end. Before watching the movie, my friends told me the audience applauded at the theaters. The biggest regret I have about the movie was not watching it in theaters. No Oscar-awarded movie ever moved me like this. This is the only romantic movie I actually liked. I sadly expect a high-standard critic to despise this movie so don't be fulled by them. Honestly most movies are so complex nowadays, I tend to get lost in them. The movie is simple, funny, and something the whole family will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Last Holiday: Diagnosis: A Good One ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Queen Latifah is in fine form as a plain worker is diagnosed with a terminal brain disorder. This is all thanks to a malfunctioning cat-scan machine.Deciding to leave life with a bang, she goes off to Europe and meets some interesting people at a skiing lodge. There's her boss, played with disdain by an older Timothy Hutton. There is her senator, who was too busy the Sunday before, to attend church services as well as a Congressman and his wife.The film deals with ethics along the way. It talks of fulfilling your life's dreams. Take the chance. It deals with a greedy, vicious corporate America. Latifah soon earns the trust of all, especially when she hits it big at the gambling table. Her scene on skis is hilarious.Her man runs to join her in a very funny ending.Good, clean fun. Worth seeing. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The promotion spots made this movie seem a lot more interesting to watch, mainly because of Queen Latifah's presence -- then again, she was in every scene of the promos. However, coming into the movie as a whole I was disappointed: the material was weak and unbelievable, the transition between scenes was bland at most, and if there was a real story, I didn't see it.A plain woman finds she has a rare disease that may kill her and decides what the hell, let's go all out, and go out in style. Not a bad concept, especially when she metamorphoses from a frump into a ghetto-fabulous, full-blown beauty and lets herself loose. Let's call her transformation that of the Charlotte Vale kind but in a lightweight mode. Charlotte-lite.It's when she checks into a posh European hotel that credibility flies out the window. I found myself checking in to see what was it that I was watching, and felt angry that somehow, I'd been had by the director and its screenwriters. I haven't seen the original and may never see it -- the premise of the other is also the same -- but I do hope that Queen Latifah finds better scripts instead of this standard fluff she was given, no doubt due to her name and screen power.</fullReview>

It continues rolling on, trotting on as many stereotypes as possible. I realize that most everything has been done but this is stultifying: the German lesbian, the power- and money-grubbing jerk played by Timothy Hutton, who's done much better work. And just once I'd like to see some fire in Queen Latifah instead of this constant happy Buddha smile. Gérard Depardieu is not even a caricature.A huge sugary wink at the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hip-hop Ho-hum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Musicians trying to prove that they can act dates back to the 1940's, when Frank Sinatra and Hoagy Carmichael took non-musical roles in some of Hollywood's biggest movies. Over the years, Elvis Presley, Ringo Starr, Barbra Streisand, Mick Jagger, Cher, Diana Ross, Kris Kristofferson, David Bowie, Dolly Parton, Sting, Madonna, and Britney Spears have all tried their hand at acting with varied results. However, in the last 15 years or so, it has become almost mandatory for hip-hop artists to play a lead role in at least one film. Some are better actors than rappers (e.g. Mark Wahlberg, Will Smith, Mos Def). Most should stick to rapping (e.g. Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson, Busta Rhymes, DMX). There are a select few who are talented at both rapping and acting (e.g. Ice Cube, Tupac Shakur, Chris "Ludacris" Bridges). And there are also a very few who can do neither well (e.g. Ja Rule, Sean "Diddy" Combs, Bow-Wow). LL Cool J is the typical rapper/actor who should stick to music. And Queen Latifah is one of the select who have no talent in music or film, Grammy and Oscar nominations notwithstanding."Last Holiday" stars both of these non-acting hip-hoppers initially playing against type as Georgia and Sean, two low-level employees of a department store who are too shy to admit their love for each other. But when Georgia is diagnosed with a terminal illness, she swaps her unconvincing shy demeanor for the patented Queen Latifah persona that you see on Leno, Letterman, Entertainment Tonight, etc. She cashes out her life's savings and heads for Europe where she dispenses wisdom, makes friends, discovers the secret to life, gets revenge on her evil boss (Timothy Hutton in full Disney-villain mode), summons up enough courage to confess her feelings to Sean, and discovers she isn't dying after all.If the poor acting of the two leads weren't enough, the script was so predictable that I was able to figure out exactly what the story arc would be and how it would end before I got twenty minutes into the movie. This film is a remake of another movie made in 1955. Perhaps these weren't clichés 51 years ago, but they sure are now. The only bright spot was Gerard Depardieu's great performance as a temperamental but kind chef. All the other actors either went for over-the-top camp or seemed as if they were reading their lines from cue cards held behind the other actors' heads.Unless a new silent era returns to film, we will always have musicians trying to break into acting. However, if the best we can hope for is something like "Last Holiday", I want the heads of all the hip-hop labels to put "no movies without real acting talent" clauses into their artists' contracts. 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been so much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to seeing this film as I genuinely believe we need more uplifting movies, but I was sorely disappointed. Queen Latifah's character is lovable and we genuinely feel for her ups and downs but the story just becomes plain silly as it goes along. It is almost as if the writers had no firm idea about where they were going with it. There was so much potential good in there- a good cast, really beautiful scenery and a powerful message but it was hidden under so much silliness at times I found myself checking for SMS messages on my cell phone rather than watching the slap-stick comedy that pops up out of the blue. The elements of physical comedy were just unneeded extras making the film too long, and the way the characters futures are presented at the end appeared to have been tacked on at the last minute by someone who had not watched the rest of the film. What a waste of Latifah's talents, and that of LL Cool J and Gerard Depardieu, who played one of the film's best characters.</fullReview>

Basically, Queen Latifa plays a dept store clerk/aspiring cook who lives her life wondering about possibilities without ever working up the courage to actually attempt make them reality. When she is diagnosed with a terminal illness, she cashes in all her assets, and starts living without consequence. I was surprised to see that LL Cool J (playing Queen's love interest) did not show his abs, take of his shirt lick his lips even once! On the contrary, he played a likable, vulnerable character which I think is a first. Some of the scenes were a little far fetched, however, we need to remember that this is a comedy movie staring 2 rap crossover actors -not Citizen Kane.

She's supported by some great talent--LL Cool J, Tim Hutton, Giancarlo Esposito, Gerard Depardieu--to be sure, but she IS the picture. The story line isn't great--too episodic--and basically this is a formula film. You know how it's going to turn out pretty much from the start. The fun is in watching the story unfold. It's also in watching the star carrying virtually every scene she's in, which is most of them. It's easy to pick this film apart and even be snide about it. But why not relax and give yourself a chance to laugh and enjoy the characters, the gorgeous New Orleans (pre-Katrina, I presume) and Prague settings, and the very-talented Queen herself.</fullReview>

Yes.Sometimes movies are just a get-away experience, where you want to have a good time, watching the actors have a good time in a relaxed situation. This movie is just that, whether its a rainy day movie thing, dinner and a movie date, or just something to pass the time you'll come away from it feeling like you got your money's worth, something that is rare in movies today. Queen Latifah has the likable personality and you just want her to win, all of the actors did well, LL Cool J, Gerard Depardeu, Giancarlo Espisito, Timothy Hutton, even the supporting, supporting cast like the doctors, the bellman, and the hotel staff.Definitely a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah this won't win awards or best picture or best actor\actress but I enjoyed it. Queen Latifah (I guess thats how you spell her name) did a good job playing a middle class women who needed more than a little push to go after her dreams. She needed to die! This film probably won't make you laugh to much. In fact, I never did laugh but I enjoyed the message which is "Live life to the fullest." I personally can relate to that.A few things did get on my nerves such as when Queen Latifah's character was hit in the head by LL Cool J. You don't even have to put it in slow motion to know that he wasn't even close to her when it happened. The acting was very average. When you learn you will die most the time you will be balling your eyes out. Queen Latifah underacted there.Overall I give the acting a 6, directing a 4, the originality a 5, the editing a 5, and the message a 8. If you like Queen Latifah than you will enjoy this film. I would watch this film but probably not buy it anytime soon. Maybe when it's in that 5.50 bin at Wal Mart!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Queen Latifah plays this shy, introverted woman who just found out that she only has three weeks to live. Realizing she doesn't have all that much time left, she decides to pack up everything she has and spend her last days at a lush European resort.That's all you really need to know about "Last Holiday." Queen Latifah does a very good job at creating a sympathetic character in Georgia, but as it was shown time and time again, star power can only do so much in a movie. Despite a lot of the hokey elements, like Latifah learning to snowboard for the first time and looking like a pro, this movie serves out its purpose to provide an hour and 30 minutes worth of escapism, which, despite a lot of "hardcore" film buffs might say, isn't necessarily a bad thing.This is not a bad movie by any means, it's just not a great movie. On my hierarchy of movies, this is a matinée kind of movie that you would take your date to, in order to kill the afternoon.Grade: C+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film as a sneak-preview and was reeeaaallly disappointed. This was one of the worst films I've ever seen as a preview. I think there is an unwritten law stating that almost any movie featuring LLCoolJ has to be bad.Georgia Byrd (Queen Latifah), working as a salesperson for cooking utilities has a crush on Sean Matthews (LLcoolJ), but both of them are to shy to make a move... Then when the fiiinally have something like a decent conversation Georgia has a small accident and is brought to a hospital. There the stereotypical Indian Doctor (small, strange accent, confusing and irritating with very little self-confidence and...meditating!) diagnoses her, with a brain tumor and she is given three more weeks to live. So she liquidates her accounts takes the next plane to Prague where she plans to spend all her money, doing what she didn't do when she did not know about her "cancer". This film rides every stereotype there is..From the little Miss-Nobody changing the "upper-classes" over the strange Indian doctor, to the African-American church where everybody just bursts into song because of one person, to live your life everyday because tomorrow you might wake up with head cancer. Also the "bad guy" is really stupid and his motives to be bad are stupid too. There is no point in that character apart from making the story even more boring.Seriously one of the worst films ever! Also working in a hospital, I know that the way she got diagnosed with that tumor is plain impossible. No way. So what they never tried that cat-scan before putting someone in there?? They didn't test the thing if it works correctly??Do yourself a favor and don't..just don't. LLcoolJ. Queen Latifah. not the best couple ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This flimsy film floats with Latifah on-board. But barely.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For better or worse, January is known for its poor theatrical releases. While quite crude, some would call?and by all means should call?January the "Yearinal," a receptacle for last year's waste. Movies that would not have survived the holiday rush (such as "Hoodwinked") or others that simply should never exist (such as "Bloodrayne") are discretely dumped into this lovely month. "Last Holiday," a remake retrofitted for Queen Latifah ("Chicago," "Beauty Shop"), is one of those movies. Directed by the alliterative Wayne Wang ("Because of Winn-Dixie," "Maid in Manhattan"), its lack of ambition, trite thematic elements, oft-tacky humor, and contrived plot(s) simply scream January release. But I daresay I enjoyed it a little, if only for Latifah.Latifah plays shy Georgia Byrd, a cookware sales clerk in a large department store, who discovers she has only three weeks to live. Upon discovering her terminal illness, she hightails it out of an antediluvian New Orleans to the Euro-luxury ski resort of her dreams. Misadventure, mayhem, and crowd-pleasing, "you go, girl!" moments of morality ensue. Quite simply, this is a very modest and mediocre movie; it is the warmly wonderful Latifah?and the cast of caricatures that she carries?who makes this movie much better than it deserves to be. In fact, this movie demonstrates quite well that the performances of a movie star and a charming cast can save a feeble film. A movie with less subtlety and sophistication than Latifah's ads for Wal-Mart, "Holiday" and the filmmakers deserve little praise. But, despite its flaws and lack of originality (keep your ears perked for a monologue about turnips that bears an uncanny resemblance to one about grapes in last year's "Sideways"), this flimsy flick floats with Latifah on-board. "Munich," "Brokeback," and friends may win a louder ovation from its audience, but in the end, Latifah, like her character, gets what she wants: the audience awards her with a less rousing but slightly warmer round of applause--if they're into this sort of thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pummels us with its "lessons"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last Holiday reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.comrating: 1.5 out of 4Director: Wayne Wang Cast: Queen Latifah, LL Cool J, Timothy Hutton Screenplay: Jeffrey Price, Peter S. Seaman MPAA Classification: PG-13 (some sexual reference)It was a tell-tale sign when Last Holiday's release date was delayed for two weeks AFTER the holidays, a smattering of dates notorious for studio dumping of probable duds. And the studios were correct in their decision, of course. Last Holiday is a disaster; a film that would mar Paramount's reputation for years had it been released on Christmas day. It's dopey and tired, desperately reaching for comedy that refuses to rear its head; reaching instead for morals and lessons so bluntly forced that they'd be more fit for pre-pubescent daytime television. We walk away feeling as though we've been hit by a bus, or maybe turned into a beaten pi?ata. Last Holiday pummels us with its "lessons", and even goes so far as to sneakily inject tidbits of religious dogma and bizarre racial generalizations. And to make matters worse, director Wayne Wang feels it's necessary to carry out this debacle for 112 minutes, causing the whole affair to last for a grating cinematic lifetime. Queen Latifah plays Georgia Byrd, a reserved, well-mannered, church-going, dietary, and single cookware saleswoman at a non-descript department store. Her treasure is a neatly assembled scrapbook entitled "Possibilities", documenting her secret affection for Sean Matthews (LL Cool J), the grill salesman. Georgia goes about her days quietly, participating in the gospel choir and cooking meals with her idol, Emeril, on the Food Channel. Her situation changes, however, when Georgia's diagnosed with Lampanson's Disease after colliding into a cabinet at work. With only two weeks left to live, Georgia decides to catch as much life as her soon-emptied bank account will allow. She flies to Europe, staying in the Presidential Suite at a mountaintop resort, taking multiple spa appointments, shopping for lavish adornments, and socializing with the most scathing and important of people. Last Holiday carries on as we expect it to, cashing in on wearily predictable moments and the inevitable "gotcha" happy ending. Georgia gallivants about with dollar-induced thrills for 100 minutes, then realizes money can't buy happiness and, instead, finds love. But Wang's love story is without heart and bursting with unearned sentimentality. So Wang instead shifts focus onto the morals he pushes, creating ill-mannered characters for Georgia to convert. We're pointedly presented with Matthew Kragen (Timothy Hutton) to represent Greed, Ms. Burns (Alicia Witt) to represent Infidelity, and Senator Dillings (Giancarlo Esposito) to offensively represent the "black man in a white man's world" who has betrayed his hometown needs for a trip to Europe. Wayne Wang may not be purposely insinuating as such, but his Senator Dillings certainly has racial meaning (a habit of Hollywood that largely goes unnoticed). The film's saving grace, however, is in its fortunate avoidance of loud, stupid slapstick antics. Last Holiday's bad enough without cheesy sound effects and banana peels. Wang smartly steers clear of these, save for one moderately irritating snowboarding romp. He also tones Queen Latifah's usual loud-mouthed, attitude-driven performance down a bit, allowing her to showcase some actual talent with her reserved, timid character. She does well, despite the screenplay bearing down on her at every angle. But this saving grace is ultimately eclipsed by Last Holiday's supreme lack of subtlety. Films about "letting go" can be done well in a mature, adult-oriented film. But the message must not be paraded about like a boy running rampant through a dinner party, displaying his treasured ball of lint to the adults. Real adults aren't affected by these mish-mash morals. There's no reality to them. No dimension beyond the silky red dress on Queen Latifah. Some may laugh and applaud Georgia's show of newfound confidence and pride, but only children would find something lasting from this film. -www.samseescinema.com</fullReview>

On are usual trip to block buster i saw the film in the comedy section, knowing the quality of work Queen Latifah puts in her movies like bringing down the house and my all time favorite film Set it off. So i took it with no hesitation and left. My god, why did i take it! When I saw the film,the queen did a great job but, it had room to improve. It seems she was not happy that she got the role in the film and she just wanted it to end. Most of the movie was predictable even the end and most of the acting was good but i still have two problems with the film. Number one LL Cool J, he ruined the film's integrity and his acting was horrible! Second, why are all these romantic/ comedy films are the same! It always begins with a life changing experience the main character goes through causing him/her forgo an adventure of great proportion, helping others, making friends and changes in their character. Then a jerk tells people the characters main intension and there's a whole depressing moment were it always rains and suddenly a Whitney Huston song play's and the character walks and has multiple flashbacks making the audience think the person has the attention span of a squirrel. In the end everything turns out great and everyone lives happily ever after. Go see this movie with an open mind and don't think of Queen Latifahs previous films. 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Happy Ending Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning of the movie, you can tell which direction this movie is going in. When the church choir was singing "Every Time I Feel The Spirit" and Queen Latifah was called out for not singing loud, you can tell that she was depressed. We all know at the beginning of the movie that Queen Latifah and LL Cool J were going to end up together. This is definitely a fairy tale movie. No one would break their boss' phone and compact disk and get away with it in real life. And no one would be stupid enough to listen to a doctor who said that they had 3 weeks to live. Who are doctors? They are not God! They can't tell a patient how long they have to live! It was amazing how Queen Latifah got to do what she wanted in this movie. How long has she been saving if she only made $29000 a year and could afford a trip to Europe? Since she was five?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Major Blooper in Last Holiday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm in the middle of the film when my mom caught a major bloomer. Latifah, portraying character Georgia Byrd, withdraws all her I.R.A. account and some money her moms left her to "splurge" sort a speak. Goes to a fancy hotel, takes private jets to another country,fancy restaurants, ski trips, buys up clothes yet couldn't get the $340,000 for the brain operation? I don't get it?? With all the money she was spending couldn't she have afforded the operation? It had to add up to about that much. Major Blooper. Does Anyone Agree?Did Anyone catch this??? What was wrong with the director or writer? He/she should have caught this major mistake in the storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was excellent- from the trailer it looked so boring and dire and that so i went in with low expectations but came out feeling good! :) 1Queen Latifah is perfect for the role and shines through every frame. The comedy is vast, intelligent, and plentiful- you will be rolling with laughter: thats a promise!Also, the scenery is so beautiful and picturesque. Moreover, the conseqences of the problem add to the superbly written plot- i must say that it should win an Oscar!The audience clapped when it ended and we wished that there would have been another hour of the striking storyline, the creative characters and the hilarious comedy!...10/10!

		<fullReview>i probably wouldn't give it a 1 out of 10 but i must admit it was a waste of ?5 to go and see this movie. There is no actual plot line and the ending seems really rushed, although i like Queen Latifah i thought this film was disastrous. I mean of all places she chose the Checz Republic to blow all her money and then suddenly realises she wasn't going to die, thats a stupid plot line to say the least. After an hour we got up and left this film and went and sat in and watched 'walk the line' which was much better... overall this was a load of trash that shouldn't even be put into production! Queen Latifah is good in the film so is LL Cool J but apart from that i found the film too stupid and far-fetched to believe, it was rubbish and i hope Queen Latifah chooses not to do another film like this because its just wasting her marvellous talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most people think Queen Latifah was the best thing about this movie, but quite frankly, she is the one major flaw.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, I've always disliked Queen Latifah ever since I saw Bringing Down the House. I found her to be annoying and abrasive. She is the stereotypical "dumb loud black woman" that appears in every other movie. Yet I've never met a black woman that acts like this stereotype.The movie itself was actually pretty decent, and I felt that most of the cast did a great job with the material which made it better. But Queen Latifah was her usual intolerable self. Sometimes, when she would rant, and others around her would clap, I'd think about how if she did this in reality and not in Last Holiday, someone would have told her to shut up.This definitely isn't the best movie I've ever seen, or even close to it. But if you're looking for a dramedy, or a comeda... this wouldn't be a bad place to start.</fullReview>

It shocked me because my boyfriend was even into it and usually he falls asleep before the middle of the movie. I recommend everyone to see the movie. It a movie that the whole family can see. There was children in the movie theater and they actually enjoyed it also. I have always loved Queen Latifah and LL Cool J because of there music, but know I like them even more because they are so diverse. They are exploring and trying new things. Even though they both have done other movies this is the first that they play older individuals. I shouldn't have to say anymore. It's a MUST SEE!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great mentor/mentoree movie--for any group!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie inspires all those things we need to do to move from dreams to reality.A group of us went to see the movie and afterwards, we talked about how we were inspired to move beyond our typical lives to seek an adventurous move....to place ourselves in unusual places. I encouraged a young woman who does move outside her world, to go even further.So...even though the dialogue may not be what "Hollywood" writers considers electric, this movie speaks to a lot of women (and girls) who work in typical jobs (like Georgia Byrd's job) to take the plunge. They realize that Georgia was the same person before she heard of her supposedly fatal disease, she just let fears hinder her.We liked that Georgia gained confidence in herself when she knew she had nothing to lose. We identified with the way she talked to God throughout the movie. It shows she has a solid relationship with God---which we all feel we have (or are achieving)~!We liked seeing a black woman in an international arena and left the movie charged--especially because it's the beginning of a new year--to try something totally different. Even though I've traveled extensively, it reminded me to take advantage of the unusual and to stretch beyond my typical self--even though I consider myself a creative person.If that doesn't speak success of a movie, I don't know what does.We movie goers have sense enough to look beyond "movie flaws" and go for the truth beneath the surface.We liked that Georgia finally got the nerve to stand up to her superiors and we enjoyed the movie's acknowledgement of the "flaws" in all people. It was a message we needed to see at the beginning of this new year.Sooooooo...watch out world!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in to the movie Last Hoilday expecting(hoping) it to be very good not only because Queen Latifah was in it but because the movie had a good premise to work with.I came out of it thinking it was OK at best. I personally believe that it was predictable . In believe Queen Latifah can do no wrong she is not only the hilarious but beautiful, and this was not the best movie she has been in for sure. Although she was funny and the perfect actress for that part it seemed like sloppy writing towards the end of the movie.Not to mention that is had loose ends that were never tied up for instance the the Hornets game, they made a point to bring it but more then once in the movie yet never did anything with it. This movie was a disappointment for what its potential could have been. If you really want to see this movie wait for it to come out on video it isn't worth a trip to the theater or your time.Kelly (age:14)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feel good warmth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to this movie for over a month after seeing the trailer many times. I thought it was going to be a hilarious film, based on the trailers. I thought I would see Queen Latifah living it up, doing and saying whatever she wanted, after being given three weeks to live.And she does. But the story is much more than that. It has warmth. Queen Latifah's performance in itself drew me into the film from start to finish. But so did the storyline and the characters. Without giving anything about the movie away, the people whom Queen Latifah meets at the luxurious resort are a varied slew of characters with high level stakes in the world of power, and we see dimensions of human-ness to them that are drawn out by Queen Latifah's visit. The transformations do not come across as phony. Rather, what could have been cardboard cut-out one dimensional characters become more real and more human as the film moves along. That too adds more warmth to the film. The film also has a romantic element which I personally thought was the first convincing romantic storyline I have seen in over a decade. What I mean by that is that from the very start, when we see Queen Latifah and her romantic interest interact, I actually saw chemistry between them and thought they belonged together, and I hoped they would become an item --- versus so many romantic comedies I have seen where witty scripting seems more important than chemistry and a feeling of authenticity in the bond between the romantic partners.I came out of this movie feeling really satisfied, like I had a hearty meal versus mass produced Hollywood popcorn fluff. Go see it and have a really wonderful time.</fullReview>

There was nothing offensive with this movie which is a change from many movies I have seen lately.

		<fullReview>Greetings!We took our 'almost' adult daughter along with us last night to see 'Last Holiday', and I don't know what we laughed at more, the movie, or our daughter who was laughing more than I've seen her do in years. In fact, the whole audience did something unexpected that I haven't seen happen in almost forever and actually gave a rousing round of applause at the end of the movie.This is just an all around 'funny' family movie with very little negative language. There are a few scenes that show mild adult situations but nothing that's overt or offensive in my opinion.As a big fan of the cooking shows of Food Network, I loved the way they worked 'cooking' into the plot. My husband loves action flicks, and there was plenty of action involved in the risks Queen Latifah's character took while experiencing life. There was a very 'sweet' romance involved, and....Well heck, why don't you go see this yourself and form your own opinion. Susan in Florida</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a sweet, heartwarming comedy with truth spicing up this delicious, Capraesque film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to see it last night at an advance sneak screening. I had seen the preview many times and thought the movie would simply be throw away fluff, but thought I would give it a chance. Little did I know how sweet this little film would turn out to be, like a gourmet desert at a four star hotel. I work at a film archive and see lots of old movies and some of the better new films, so I'm kind of jaded when it comes to big studio releases. But I also attend lots of festivals and love the atmosphere of seeing a movie on the big screen with an audience that really wants to enjoy the feature. So if you think you might like it, I recommend it with a vote of 8 out of 10! But if you don't like MEET JOHN DOE, MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE then skip it.SPOILERS: The story concerns an average working person who dutifully does her job but dreams of a better tomorrow. When a small accident leads the shy Queen Latifah to her bargain basement HMO, she is hit with the devastating news she has three weeks to live. She turns to God and asks why? Not waiting for an answer, she decides to make up for lost time and live life to the fullest, withdrawing her life savings and retirement money to go on one, blow-it-all vacation at an expensive resort in Europe. The Frank Capra like touch comes when this average working-class woman makes friends and an enemy or two among the rich and the powerful by being just herself, totally honest with nothing to loose. Her heartwarming goodness cracks thru the uppity superficial exterior of the "movers and shakers" she meets. They first respect her because they thinks she's either rich or a corporate spy not knowing her circumstances. And there's lots of spice in this romantic stew, like handsome singer-turned-actor, LL Cool J as the guy back home who falls for Latifah, but is too shy to tell her. Gerard Depardieu is delightfully refreshing as a gourmet French chef that finds her appreciation of his efforts liberating in this low-fat fad culture (ah Butter!). Timothy Hutton turns in a strong performance as the egotistical manipulator that both owns the department store where Latifah worked and wrote the book that made her neurotic supervisor such a pusher/driver. Now she meets Hutton at the resort where he is trying to buy the favors of her New Orleans district's Congressman to advance another shady deal. All the supporting actors turn in believable performances creating identities for their characters that warm up to the disarming charms of this lady who has nothing to loose. There are funny scenes of slapstick action on the ski slopes and there are shopping spree scenes like those in PRETTY WOMAN but it's the directors wise, subtle touch having the leads slightly underplay their performance that brings balance to this delicious comedy banquet. Bon appetite !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Timothy Hutton was once one of the most promising actors in films. With an Academy Award to his credit for "Ordinary People", and successful, if weaker films like "Daniel", "Taps" and "Falcon and the Snowman. Now he is playing second-rate "bad guy" roles in "B" comedies? Next he'll turn up in "Dunston Checks In, Part II".It's not that "Last Holiday" is a bad film, it's just that it has every cliché and predictable plot twist that Hollywood ever invented.Queen Latifah gives it her all, and does succeed in carrying the majority of the picture. But all of the supporting characters are cardboard cut-outs. And the dialogue that they have is atrocious. LL Cool J is very good as her love interest, but he can only do so much with what he's given.Rent only if you have to.</fullReview>

If you don't know whats gonna happen at the end of the movie you are senile. Than you have LL cool J. I've seen better acting on a daytime soap opera. Every one of his scenes is a slap to the face of acting. His scenes also make no sense. For instance, you see him walk up the side of a mountain in feet of snow when there's a road close by. I have no idea why they chose him to act in this movie. Queen Latifah acts fine. As i said before, I am on the fence.

The laughter was so loud during the movie, you missed some of the dialogue, but if you want a delightful evening with no real message to the movie be sure and go see this delightful romp. You will come out of the move just feeling real good. It is well worth the price of the ticket. It was good to see Timothy Hutton in a non typical role as the villain and LL Cool J.

I know Kate Hudson wants Carole's crown real bad, but it's so refreshing to see Queen's "every woman" take on it. Queen Latifah makes this movie more believable than any slip of a starlet could. She executes witty banter and physical comedy with equal skill and elegance.Of course, the original film of the same name was made in England in 1950 with Alec Guinness and written by the brilliant J.B. Priestley (see Priestley's IMDb biography: it's excellent). It's only available on VHS and I have not seen it. I will try and do so, but I'm glad I saw this first. Great modern romantic comedy.

		<fullReview>This movie has the tone of a romantic comedy, like a Maid in Manhattan type feel. I would say it is a "chick-flick." I saw a sneak preview last night and my friend and I both laughed and teared up, so all around it hit the emotional highlights. This movie was predictable, but pleasantly, not annoyingly, so. It is uplifting and sweet and a great movie to start the New Year. If you are fan of the Food Network and Emeril (which I am HUGE fans of both) their cameos are sure to please! At first I wondered why this movie was just premiering (title "Last HOLIDAY") but the holidays played no role in this film. The theme is more along the lines of a New Years Resolution inspiration to get people fired up for the changes in their lives. Now having seen this for free I would not pay full price to see it again, but I would recommend it and would see it again at the discounted theaters, will rent it and would consider buying the DVD. Judging by the boisterous reactions of the audience during several key points in the movie (cheers, clapping, laughter, shouts of approval and joy, etc) I would say that this movie will be well received and enjoyed by most!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Latifah's latest effort a cute, entertaining diversion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You may have begun to think that after such flops as "Taxi," "Beauty Shop" and "Barber Shop," Queen Latifah's film career peaked with her Oscar-nominated performance in "Chicago" in 2001. That opinion may change a little after viewing her latest effort, "Last Holiday," a cute comedy about a dying woman who goes on a spending spree during her last few weeks on Earth.Basically, it's a remake of the 1950 Alec Guinness film (he was better), as well as Jerry Lewis' "Hook, Line &amp; Sinker" (1969) in which he runs up thousands of dollars in expenses following a terminal diagnosis.Latifah is Georgia Byrd, a quiet, single, New Orleans woman who works as a sales representative in the cookware department of a local department store. Always dreaming of a better life, as well as the affections of a co-worker, Sean Williams (LL Cool J).She's lonely and shy, and even keeps a book of "Possiblities" in which she places notes and photos of her fondest desires. An accidental bump on the head, though, causes her cautious world to come tumbling down as an MRI reveals that she has the fatal "Lamingham's Disease," a previously undiagnosed malady that gives her just three weeks to live.Faced with her own upcoming mortality, and the fact that she has salted away a considerable sum of cash, Georgia decides to take the trip of her dreams, the Grandhotel Pupp in Czechoslovakia.There, she somehow charms her way into the hearts of a U.S. senator (Giancarlo Espisito, "Derailed"), a congressman (Michael Nouri, "The Terminal"), a world famous chef (Gerard Depardieu), and the mistress of the department store's owner (Alicia Witt, "The Upside Of Anger").Only the sleazy mogul, Matthew Kragen (Timothy Hutton, Oscar-winner for "Ordinary People") sees through her, but she bungles through, excelling at snowboarding ? even though she has never done it before ? and bank-jumping off a huge dam.Finally, Sean (who somehow had enough cash on hand to do so) makes the Transatlantic journey to find his beloved, about the same time as her doctor, Gupta (Ranjit Chowdhry), discovers some important news. Premise is pretty silly, considering Georgia is only given three weeks to live (which seems a pretty short duration), plus, she seemingly has an endless supply of funds for a department store sales rep.In one particularly goofy scene, she complains about flying economy class, asks how much it costs to be in first class, and, in the next scene, is flying up front. The slapstick sequences (including Georgia hurling down a ski slope out of control and wiping out Kragen and a dozen others) are also pretty lame.But, overall, the film is basically harmless, silly and entertaining. It won't win any awards, but it is a decent diversion for January, and that's not such a bad thing.</fullReview>

Well her acting I don't care much for, she's funny on talk shows like Conan but not in movies.It wasn't that great of a movie but it had its moments. The first hour was EXTREMELY slow, but started to finally pick up after that then died down again.Some jokes that it had everyone were laughing at, I understood the point of the jokes but they were not laugh out loud funny. Then there were jokes that were actually funny that I got but no one else did, and after I laughed, others joined in to fit in.There were a few caricatures that I liked, such as Dr. Gupta (Ranjit Chowdhry) played his part really well. And Matthew Kragen (Timothy Hutton).There were some filming things I also saw that I didn't like and that I would have done different as a film maker, I also would have had the ending somewhat different, it left a few things out that I would have added that would have made the ending come together a LOT better Bottom line... this is not a movie I would pay to see, as I saw this in a screening. If someone offers to pay then its something to do I guess.</fullReview>
