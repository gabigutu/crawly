		<shortDescription>Terrific, moody slasher!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the wake of Halloween and Friday the 13th, many similar films were released, most of which had little or no distinguishing features. One of the most effective and atmospheric was My Bloody Valentine.Shot in Canada and very infamous for it's brutal battle with the MPAA, My Bloody Valentine is a surprising success, and a wonderful addition to the slasher genre. The acting is good, which comes as quite a shock for any slasher lover. The deaths, while obviously edited, are very effective and intense, especially the laundry room sequence. The image of the killer, dressed in a full miner's garb, smashing the lights along an already dark mine shaft, while a group of victims try to escape is terrifying.The setting is quite interesting. Most Canadian films try to disguise the fact that it's Canadian. Well, this movie doesn't, which makes it very neat.I'd say that it's lush photography, good acting, frightening set pieces and killer, and brutal deaths make this is one of the most impressive slashers of the 80's, maybe of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine is one of the best and most well-made slasher flicks of the 80's. It's also one of the better holiday themed horror movies around!A crazed miner is determined to stop the celebration of Valentine's day in a small Nova Scotia town, with the help of a trusty pick ax that is. * minor (or miner, I'm not funny.) spoilers *While the film doesn't re-invent the wheel for slasher movies, it still manages to stand out well from the rest of it's kind. The climax in the mine creates some great suspense in an atmospheric and claustrophobic setting. The cast is quite likable and good, even though there's not a known name in sight. And the gore hounds should enjoy the happenings, cutting out hearts and pick ax murders, even a nasty death-by-dryer and a face scalded in a boiling pot. It's still gory despite cuts made by the MPAA. There's also the occasional touch of colorful dark humor.The direction, while simple, is well done with some good shock cuts. The music score is a nicely moody one, even beautiful in a way. Over all, the film holds together well.Seek it out slasher fans! This is one enjoyable cult film that is not to be missed!*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We'll probably never be-able to see how the movie should have been...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notorious for being the slasher film most tortured by the censors upon release, MY BLOODY VALENTINE has become something of a cult classic with legions of adoring fans. The only available version of this movie is missing over 9 minutes of gore, but thankfully producer John Dunning has located all of the absent footage and a battle rages on with copyright owners Paramount for a fully restored release. The movie itself nestles nicely with ROSEMARY'S KILLER as the two best non-franchise splatter flicks of 1981.From the outset, we're introduced to the small mining town of Valentine Bluffs, which hides beneath its fun loving exterior a best-forgotten secret. Twenty years ago the supervisors at the mine were so eager to get to the annual Valentine dance that they didn't bother to check the levels of the methane gas. There was a massive explosion and five workers were trapped underneath the rubble and debris. The only survivor was one Harry Warden, who never mentally recovered from the accident. Exactly a year later he returned and brutally killed the two who were responsible for the tragic mishap. He cut out their hearts, stuck them in candy boxes and sent them to the authorities. Fortunately he was caught before he carried out any more killings and was put into Eastfield Asylum for the insane. Now in 1981 the happy go lucky residents of the usually tranquil town are preparing themselves for the first Valentine dance to be held since that fateful night two decades ago. Memories of Warden's murders have passed and a group of fun loving kids are thinking about nothing else but the anticipated party. However the night before the event the town mayor receives a blooded heart in a candy box with a poetic warning. It seems Harry has returned?MY BLOODY VALENTINE is certainly a fine example of eighties splatter at it's best. Although the acting isn't remarkable, I found that the three leads were competent enough and the script gave us enough time to get to know them. There's an interesting sub-plot that builds between T.J. (Kelman), Axel (Affleck) and Sarah (Hallier). Apparently T.J. was with Sarah before he went away for a while without telling anyone where he was going. Now he's returned and his buddy Axel is with his old flame. Cue the flying sparks! The rest of the wacky cast members are so cheery and carefree that you just know something dreadful is going to happen to them! There's a practical joker (who surprisingly isn't the fat guy), a couple of overly randy teens and even a hammy old guy who tells the kids that they're doomed just like Ralph over at Camp Crystal Lake! Credit has to be given for the effort from all involved. The movie began filming in September 1980, but the set designer took the time to make sure that everything was decked out in hearts and banners and they made things look like it actually was Valentine's Day. Mihalka makes good use of the spooky mine as a setting and most of the murders are imaginative and well thought out. In one scene a victim is trapped in a room where miner's uniforms are dropping from rails and surrounding her. In panic she tries to find a way out of the claustrophobic and threatening setting (all courtesy of the killer), before bumping into a costume that actually has the murderer in it! If that isn't bad enough, he kills her in a most gruesome fashion! His disguise is arguably one of the best of the eighties and the gas mask sure helps make the traditional ?heavy breathing' - sound much scarier. There are also one or two jumps that'll probably get you if you haven't seen this before and it's all accompanied with a satisfactory score from Paul Zaza. The plot is actually pretty smart for a slasher film. I wont go into too much detail because I can't say anything without spoiling it all for you, but watch how they manage to keep you guessing toward the end. It's also worth noting that James Mangold borrowed that classic body (or in his case, head) in a tumble dryer scene for his part-slasher, IDENTITY in 2003. In 2001 George Mihalka went to Paramount with a script for MY BLOODY VALENTINE 2 but they turned him down because the original didn't do brilliantly at the box office. Just proves how annoying they really are doesn't it! They've already said that they'd have no interest in seeing the director's cut of this movie released, even though fans around the world are begging for it. Recently the company asked people to give them ten films that we want to see unleashed and apparently one of those ten was MY BLOODY VALENTINE UNCUT; so we'll just have to wait and see if they come round to our way of thinking. Just imagine if they gave us the full works: The first four FRIDAY THE 13THs and this movie all uncut on special edition discs with commentaries where available and all the trimmings. If Raimi can do it for EVIL DEAD then someone can do it for us! Come on Paramount, lighten up and get on the case!All in all this is a great little horror movie. It's smartly directed with a likeable cast and a really tense finale. The only problem lies with the shameful editing in the kill scenes where 9 minutes was savagely removed. I'm beginning to think that old Harry Warden should take a trip to the Paramount office, pickaxe in hand, to get revenge on these brutal spoilsports. Still, a few niggles aside, this is a decent little movie from Canada that deserves to be remembered, as one of the best of it's kind. And that's a sure fire compliment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bloody Good Time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than just a guilty pleasure -- this one's actually good!By the time 1981 had rolled around, the horror genre had gained much momentum with holiday-themed slasher flicks such as "Halloween" and "Friday The 13th." Never ones to shy away from a good cash-cow, Paramount (the same company to bring you "Friday The 13th") hired George Mihalka to direct the Valentine's Day themed "My Bloody Valentine." Pre-dating much of the camp and excess of the 80's, "My Bloody Valentine" is a pretty innocent film in it's own right, a glimpse into a time before the genre was completely saturated with masked killers and dumbed-down teenagers. It's simply a well-paced, well-oiled little horror movie. It's got a surprising amount of suspense, matched only by the outrageous and often over-the-top visual effects which -- thanks to a newly restored print of the film on DVD -- have finally seen the light of day.With his film, Mihalka injects a good dosage of suspense, as well as some subtle stylishness. The grimy and grungy setting -- a dumpy mining town in Canada -- gives the film an unmistakably realistic look and feel, which only helps to drive home the authenticity. Sure, the film has it's fair share of clichés; in fact, some of the dialogue and plot-points appear to be ripped straight out of the original "Friday The 13th." The story of a deranged killer returning home years later to exact his revenge on a town is hardly re-inventing the wheel. But when stacked up against it's competition, "My Bloody Valentine" holds it's own. It's one of the few films from the much maligned (and yet, enjoyable) era to actually hold up to today's standards (for the most part). Truth be told, even if you are viewing the heavily edited theatrical cut, the film works just as well without the heavy special effects, which is a testament to the overall quality of a film that was conceived, created and released in under half a year's time.Sure, it's got it's flaws, but nothing fatal. If you can stomach bad characters, even worse actors and a few clichés here and there, it's a pretty satisfying experience. At the very least, it pre-dates a lot of more successful films and has had a subtle influence on the genre as a whole. Fans of the genre should be aware of it not just as a fun way to kill time -- which it is -- but also as a perfect example of a slasher done right. With a remake currently in theaters and a DVD that treats the film right, "My Bloody Valentine" is finally having it's day in the sun. Even if you've "seen it all," you'll still have a good time with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This pointless holiday deserves a good slasher film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've enjoyed this low-budget flick since childhood. I like it so much that I make sure to see it at least once every year in the month of February. Though it suffers from a restricted budget, a cast of unknowns, and a serious case of over-editing, this is still worth a look for horror buffs.The story centers around a crazed miner who returns to haunt a small mining town in Canada twenty years after an accident on Valentine's Day nearly killed him. It seems he and a few others were trapped in a coal mine while the rest of the town was attending a big Valentine's Day dance which had been a tradition for over 100 years. The town is called Valentine Bluffs, for Pete's sake! Anyway, this miner known as "Harry Warden" was buried in the mine for six weeks following an explosion caused by the failure of two supervisors to check the methane gas levels in the mine shaft. It seems the supervisors were a little too anxious to get to that dance and forgot to make sure Harry and the others were safely out. Harry Warden was the only survivor and apparently had to feast on the dead bodies of the other miners until he was rescued.Needless to say after that ordeal, Harry had to be committed to a mental hospital. But one year later, on Valentine's Day, Harry Warden broke out of the looney bin and came back to Valentine Bluffs to seek some revenge. He killed the two supervisors and stuffed their hearts in heart-shaped candy boxes and left them at the dance with a warning attached. Valentine Bluffs must never hold another Valentine's Day dance again!!!! Now how about THAT for a set-up???? As our movie begins, we find twenty years have passed, and the town is ready to hold another big dance on Feb. 14th. Do you think Harry Warden would let that happen? Certainly not! Corpses begin piling up and more heart-stuffed candy boxes are sent to the police chief warning him to cancel the dance. He does so, but a bunch of young miners still throw a party: You guessed it- AT THE MINE!!!! That sets up a dramatic showdown with the killer and his new crop of victims.This film has a number of strengths. A man dressed in full mining gear is in fact quite scary. The gas mask he wears also gives his breathing a Darth Vader kind of effect. A pick ax is one hell of a weapon, too. There are some very funny characters that make up this town. The mayor and the police chief are so serious it's almost laughable. The young men who work in the mine are a rowdy bunch who love to drink Moosehead beer. It's my guess that Moosehead beer donated a good chunk of change to this movie due to how much you see of their product. The bartender at their local hangout is a real hoot, as well. He's pretty much the crazy old man who warns the youngsters that they're doomed like the old guy from the Friday the 13th movies.Oh, and Lori Hallier who plays the lead female is an incredibly beautiful woman. Just had to mention that.There is some good camera work. I especially like the shot from inside a mine elevator as it plunges deep into the mine. The camera stays focused on the top of the shaft, and spooky music plays as the cage sinks deeper and deeper into the mine. Love that little folk song during the end credits, too! There are some faults, though. This film appears to have had much of the gore trimmed from it. That can be a big mistake for a horror film. Also, it isn't hard to figure out that Harry Warden is not the killer and that one of the two male leads definitely is.A perfect romantic evening would include a six-pack of Moosehead, this film, and a heart-stuffed candy box. I promise your girlfriend will never forget it.8 of 10 stars So sayeth the Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Classic 80's horror (only if you have unrated version)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i had seen this film a couple of times back in the day and had always thought it was a alright 80's slasher but was disappointed by some acting and the gore value, well recently they had released a special edition extended cut of the movie so i picked it up just cause i collect old school horror and thought it would be an alright piece to my collection, well little did i know i was right, there is so much gore that was taken out of this film i was in shock and dumbfounded to know that for 30 years no one has actually really seen this movie. the gore in this is so well done for an 81 film you can definitely tell they were all thinking they had to one up the first Friday the 13th. its a shame the mpaa are such bastards it makes you wonder how many movies you've seen that they butchered like this one. and you leave that movie thinking it was crap when really it was a classic horror that was just heavily edited. well thank god for DVD so if you see the special edition at your store i suggest buying it if your a old school gore fan there is some sick ass special effects that im sure most of the budget of the film was spent on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I warned you once, I warned you twice, if you skip "My Bloody Valentine" you'll pay the price!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the wake of the successes of "Black Christmas" (1974), "Halloween" (1978) and "Friday the 13th" (1980), there seemed to be a craze not only for slasher flicks, but for holiday-themed slasher flicks. There were many imitators, many slasher flicks that lacked distinction or anything of redeeming value. Still, one of the best, not to mention criminally underrated, was "My Bloody Valentine" from 1981.Set against the backdrop of Valentine's Day in a small Nova Scotian mining town, a Valentine's Day dance, once the most celebrated holiday function in town, has been put off for 20 years due to a tragedy at the local mine. Five miners were trapped underground by an explosion, because the two supervisors who were supposed to be on-duty had failed to check the methane levels because they were in a hurry to get to the dance. Six weeks later, we're told, only one of the miners survived, Harry Warden, who survived by eating the flesh of his dead comrades and was committed to a mental institution shortly thereafter. One year later, he killed the two supervisors responsible for the disaster and later vowed vengeance upon the town if they were to ever celebrate another Valentine's Day.20 years later, a group of hormonally-charged young people ("young people," not teenagers) who work in the local mine are eager to have another Valentine's Day festivity, despite the warnings of the town's elders not to do so. Pretty soon, the mayor receives an eerie warning and a heart-shaped candy box filled with a real human heart, and not long after young people left and right start dying in increasingly horrific and creative fashions - a laundry machine, a nail gun, a shower head, ropes, hot dogs (yes, hot dogs!), and the killer's trademark pick-axe figure into some of the most gruesome ways the characters in this movie are dispatched."My Bloody Valentine" was directed by George Mihalka, and his direction and production design are what is largely responsible for making this an above average slasher flick. This movie is all of well-acted, well-made, and has a fantastic and creepy story. Like in "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th," the viewer is many times party to the slaughter of young people because of the fact that the film is often shot from the point-of-view of the killer; so we often hear his deep breaths from behind a gas mask as he stalks and slaughters his victims.The second half of the film is set largely underground, in a real mine in Nova Scotia, Canada. These underground scenes are generally very creepy and claustrophobic, dimly-lit and you get the feeling that every time someone strays from the group or wanders down a dark tunnel alone, something could jump out of the darkness to dispatch them; these creepy and claustrophobic scenes of darkness remind one of the underground scenery in the recent British horror movie classic "The Descent" (2005) - which is also one of my all-time favorite horror movies.In terms of pure slasher movie goodness, "My Bloody Valentine" doesn't disappoint. The movie abides by almost every slasher movie cliché imaginable (the virgin survives, sex = death, don't say "I'll be right back," because you won't, etc. - see Randy in "Scream" for further details). But surprisingly, even with its hormonally-charged young people and plenty of sex and innuendo, there is no actual on-screen nudity. (Huh???) Strange but true, people die in some incredibly gruesome ways in this picture, but there's no gratuitous nudity anywhere - they aren't really sex scenes, but actually they're more like make-out scenes and the most "skin" we see is a girl in her bra and panties - so "My Bloody Valentine" gets bonus points from me for that.Lastly, "My Bloody Valentine" has also been the source of much controversy in the 28 years since it was released, largely due to the fact that at least five minutes of on-screen gore were cut from the film (additionally, none of this lost footage contains any extra sex or nudity); virtually every death scene in the movie was trimmed in some fashion by the MPAA. This lost footage was restored in the recently released extended cut of the film. If this movie were released today, I seriously doubt that these cuts would be enforced by the MPAA, but I guess one can understand why they were made back in '81; they are quite nasty and will surely please gore-hounds, but with this new extended cut of the film you get the feeling that you're watching the complete movie, one that is finally free of the ugly influence of censorship.I'm glad to say that now, especially since I saw "Drag Me to Hell" yesterday, I have yet another summer horror movie to add to my list of movies to watch during the Halloween season - "My Bloody Valentine."P.S.: "My Bloody Valentine" was remade earlier this year as a 3-D movie.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Deer Hunter of 80's slashers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This early 80's horror flick is one of the best of the slasher genre. It has a great setting in a small Canadian mining town - which has it's streets and buildings drenched with red and pink valentine decorations - which is a surreal contrast to the cold and sombre setting that foreshadows the real pumpers that eventually pop up in crimson heart shaped candy boxes.The scenes filmed in an actual mine - where the protagonists are trapped with the killer lurking around with a sharpened pickaxe - are expertly filmed with plenty of style and a menacing atmosphere. The acting is decent and although some of the characters act like jerks they are likable and human enough for the viewer to care about them. They are all working class stiffs and just want a good time and relief from the reality of their everyday situation. You want them to have their valentine party that has been denied them for obvious reasons.Notorious for being one of the most censored films by the MPAA at the time of release to avoid an 'X' rating, it is now available in an uncut form on Lionsgate DVD. The death scenes are much more detailed and graphic, but either version is worth watching for the flourish that the director and his cast and crew have imbued into this little horror gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once upon a time, On a sad Valentine, There's a place known as Hanniger mines...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1980's was and remains one of the most controversial time periods in the history of the horror genre. On one hand; it saw the birth of several of the genre's greatest films and many of the most entertaining films that still have historical significance. On the other, the genre was dominated by the slasher genre so much that the cycle became old virtually overnight, leading some to gloss over some worthwhile films and for bad films to get elevated to classic status in later years.'My Bloody Valentine' may not be a masterpiece, but it has enough distinguishing elements to make it a nice hidden gem of it's sub-genre. It's proved to be a delight for many a insomnia-stricken devotee of obscure horror films searching for a nice late-night horror film to divert ourselves with, and this is perfect. The film could be summed up as a mix of 'Screaming Mimi', 'Halloween' and 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'.The setting is a dismal Canadian mining town(filled with the kind of accents later parodied to death on 'South Park') known as Valentine bluffs, overshadowed by the Hanniger mines, both supposedly haunted by a vengeful miner who was wronged by lazy foremen who were attending a valentine's dance and following an unforgettable, almost dreamlike sequence dripping with bizarre sexual subtext and macabre humor that opens the film; the film's tone is set with an introduction to the leads emerging from a mine shaft as one miner remarks that any day the entire mine is gonna blow, but no one heeds his warning and races off laughing to country music while the clouds close over the town ominously, as if the cheerfulness is about to be swallowed up by an encroaching evil. It's not much, but it beats just about every other '80's slasher film at establishing mood.None of the actors could seriously be called great, but they do their jobs well enough to establish the usual paper-thin characters with personality. Not too much, but enough for the viewer to feel that a life has been taken, and not that they just witnessed some lame FX showcase; a particularly memorable scene involves the girlfriend of the comedy-relief character going into shock upon finding his corpse as the killer is approaching. A scene that's hard to forget anytime soon. Even the obligatory helpless adults seemed genuinely concerned and use common sense; with the Sheriff being a !GASP! likable character! Corrupt cops can be funny, but it's refreshing to see a competent one in these films. The two protagonist's of the film who are caught in a love triangle with the heroine also overcome weak dialog and minimal characterization through sheer emotion; enough so that both work as red herring characters, but still have good points and bad points that would make it believable if either was the killer. A nice touch lost in the remake, where the character who functions as the hero is very unlikeable and the character revealed as the killer engenders viewer sympathy.About the killer, the image of a madman in a mining suit with a pickax as a weapon is definitely an unforgettable visual, leading to several memorable 'bus' sequences. The back story behind the original killer is also quite creative. It would work well enough to carry a film on it's own or serve as an EC. comic plot.The final scene where the second killer wanders off into the mine spouting some of the most convincingly psychotic dialog I've ever heard while uttering a laugh guaranteed to freeze your blood, while simultaneously a country ballad begins to play over the credits is fairly sublime. Whether he returns or not, he will end up just like the original killer; a legend lost in the mists of time: 'And no one will knowww, as the years come and goooo, of the horror, from long time agoooo'. Brilliant.Go in with fairly limited expectations, a sense of humor, and 'My Bloody Valentine' will prove a fun experience, certainly more satisfying than the more famous 'Friday the 13th' films. The remake doesn't have much to recommend except for it's now useless 3-D gimmick; but watch that in a similar frame of mind, and you may enjoy that as well, despite having a disappointing climax and an awful Shamaylan-style cheat. When the 14th draws near, watch this film on a double feature with the 'Poetic Justice' segment from Francis's 'Tales from the Crypt'(1972), and the remake if you enjoy that, throw the god awful 2001 film 'Valentine' in the fireplace to keep warm, curl up with some caramels and you'll find this film the perfect alternative to one of the world's sh*ttiest holidays. I can guarantee you a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Slasher That Paramount and the MPAA Tried to Kill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twenty years ago, Harry Warden went nuts and slaughtered a bunch of people on Valentine's Day. The mining town he hailed from canceled subsequent V-Day dances, but when they try setting one up again, Warden seemingly returns with his pickax, ready to hack the local kids up and leave his mark. Things can only go bad from here.Director George Mihalka brings us another holiday-themed slasher, riding the success of "Black Christmas", "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th"... and paving the way for "April Fools Day". But George is a nice guy and I don't want to say he's just one among the crowd. There were hundreds of 80s slashers, but only a few stand out today. "Bloody Valentine" is, of course, one of them.Even in its original, neutered glory (anywhere from three to nine minutes were cut) the film stands as a good film. Without any really notable actors or actresses (okay, so Neil Affleck had a brief role in "Scanners"), and being Mihalka's one big mark, the film carries itself on story, acting and blood. The blood, while lacking a times, comes gushing through in others. And like any good slasher, the killer's identity is not revealed until the end... leaving us guessing until the last twist of the knife (or ax).Slasher fans need to pick up the Lions Gate special edition. While the double-disc with "April Fools Day" is cheap and still worth watching, you don't really know this film until you've seen it uncut. The gore, oh my, the gore! It's actually a shame that it took so long for a company to come along and save this film because it was even better than we once assumed... Mihalka could have been one of the 80s greats (and, in my mind, he still is).If you've been a horror fan and avoided this one, please see it. Sure, it's mostly mindless fun -- kids drinking and making out, getting hacked up -- but I can watch variations of this formula dozens, scores or hundreds of times. There's something fun about a simple stalking film that you can't always get from other films that try too hard to be clever. And I like thinking films, but a night with buddies and booze... you need a slasher. And this is the one you should pick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine (1981) takes place in a small mining town. Valentine's Day is coming and so is the reappearance of a local and nasty legend. Some deranged sweethearts' killer is back on the loose as the community cringes in horror or is it? Can these youngsters hold off this weirdo until day break or will they all become it's next victims?A decent slasher/stalker horror film. Sadly, like most of the films that came out during the early 80's, the studios took shears to the prints cutting out the best parts of the movie. If the studio didn't slice the graphic set pieces into ribbons, this would have been a true classic. Alas, it's not. Left alone this could have been a great one. But it's not.

		<shortDescription>With the added footage, one of the best slasher films of the last 40 years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** This comment may contain spoilers *** When My Bloody Valentine was released in 1981, the censor board cut it to pieces leaving us with a good horror film but not a great one. All of that has changed now that the producers have managed to get a hold of the 9 minutes of gore that was cut out of the film to retain an R rating. What started out as a very atmospheric yet pedestrian film, is now elevated to near perfection with the lost footage being added. My Bloody Valentine can be bought on DVD in Special Edition format and for the $15.00 you will pay, it is more than worth it.I am going to assume that most people have seen the film, so I'll refrain from giving you a synopses of the film, but instead I'll tell you about some of the missing pieces to the film and why it makes it so much better.The film opens with two people walking deep into a mine and then stopping to have sex. As the woman takes off her shirt, above her left breast is a tattoo of a heart. This drives the other miner mad and he pushes her up against the pick-axe stuck in the wall. The pick axe comes out of her chest and protrudes from the tattoo.The next addition to the film is one of the most infamous cuts to the film and it gained a reputation for one of the goriest scenes ever cut from a film. And no one had seen it. It involved Mabel, at the laundromat, getting killed and then her corpse shows up in the dryer the next day as the police chief finds her. Her body has all it's skin burned off it and the eyes are bulging and she is blood red. The corpse is very, very real looking and it is a celebration of make-up and special effects. Just the addition of this scene is worth buying the DVD.The next that I recall is when the bartender tries to set up some sort of booby trap to scare the kids. He has a miner's costume, complete with a pick axe, wired to one of the doors. As the door opens the costumer pops out to give a bit of a scare. As he opens the door one last time, the real Harry Warden pops out and rams his pick axe through his chin and out of his eyeball. This is another wondrous shot with amazing attention to detail. The scene looks authentic and for a film with such a parsimonious budget, they certainly got the most out of the special effects.I'll mention two more. One is when two of the party goers are in the mine and are about the make love and then of course the guy runs off to get beers. This leaves the girl all alone and then she is attacked and rammed into one of the pipes in the shower. She is left suspended by the pipe and water is shooting out of her mouth. It is truly a marvellous scene.We also get a very realistic nail gun to the head scene when the nails look they went into Hollis' head.The only caveat to this is that when the old footage is inserted (edited) into the film, because is is so old and has presumably been sitting in a tin can somewhere for almost 30 years, the film is faded, but this doesn't take away from how effective the scenes are.My Bloody Valentine, the theatrical cut is a creepy, stylish, claustrophobic feeling film with enough suspense and likable characters that it is a nice addition to the horror family. But there was always something missing. Well here we are 28 years later and that missing something has turned this film into one of the best horror films of the last 40 years. I highly recommend that if you like the film, get this edition on DVD. You won't be disappointed.Theatrical Cut: 7/10 Special Edition: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good early 80's slasher film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On Valentine's day many years ago, a miner went berserk and killed a lot of residents in a small town. Since then Valentine's Day has been ignored and not celebrated at all. Until now.A bunch of kids eager to go partying decide to throw a Valentine's Day party and wipe out the town's tradition. One setback; a crazy dude in a miner suit starts killing people. Is it the same deranged miner from years ago or someone else? Slasher films had their glory days in the early 80's, people simply couldn't get enough of them. By the time of this film's release, certain holidays or dates had been immortalized through horror films (Christmas in Black Christmas, Halloween, Friday the 13th to name the obvious), so why not make Valentine's Day another blood soaked day for horror fans? The film is largely successful too.Early 80's slashers seem to creep up above later slasher entries, simply because of the era they were filmed in. The atmosphere captured in these films doesn't seem attainable in 90's slashers or thereafter. Don't really know why. Probably a bit more enthusiasm in creating these cheap flicks before they became so mainstream and age-group targeted.Director Mihalka creates a decent amount of suspense, especially once the film enters the mine, where it becomes downright creepy as hell. Death scenes are pretty imaginative and there's also a surprise twist in the end. Unfortunately the film had the grave misfortune of being distributed by Paramount, the evil enemy to all slasher fans, and suffers badly from blatant cuts which were administered to secure an R-rating.Despite that, My Bloody Valentine is very entertaining to fans of slasher films; the film has a creepy mood all the way, decent actors and some top notch set pieces that are sure to give you a jolt on occasion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This horror film provides great load of screams , grisly killings and creepy atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nice terror movie plenty of ominous murders , chills , thrills , scary scenes and lots of blood and guts . Slasher movie about a coalminer who axes numerous victims in a little mining town which becomes pretty sinister with the miner killer appearing . The caption near the beginning states "Thursday February 12th", indicating that the dance will be on Saturday the 14th . A decades old folk tale surrounding a deranged murderer killing those who celebrate Valentine's Day, turns out to be true to legend when a group defies the killer's order and people start turning up dead . This bizarre little horror movie is set in a mining town , on Valentine an explosion of methane gas took the lives of a group of coal miners working in the Hanniger Mine . Long time after, Hanniger (Kelman) returns to his hometown on the tenth anniversary of the Valentine's night massacre that claimed the lives of 22 people , male as well female and many of the townspeople have their hearts removed with a pick-axe and sent in candy boxes . There's a big valentine-party planned in the little coal mining town of Valentine Bluffs, Nova Scotia . Later on , a blood-soaked heart arrives at the police station commanded by Chief Jake Newby (Don Francks) , accompanied by a heinous message . Hanniger meets his old flame named Patty (Cynthia Dale) and a bit later on he finds himself suspected of committing some new killings . The Valentine party is prohibited but being held in another place: at the coal mine, and it isn't long before the town's young people begin dying violently . It appears Harry Warden , a psychotic coalminer who has returned to punish them and several people are cruelly murdered .The picture is a sleek production with average budget and packs genuine chills , suspense , tension , head-slitting and shocks ; it turns out to be a terror-thriller very exciting . Gory , gruesome , pretty repellent , ghastly and unrelenting shock-feast laced with a loving triangle . The film is paced with intelligent edition , special use of color and slick utilization of shock images that take place in the astonishing close-up crimes committed by means of a pickax . This scary movie displays terror , shocks , hard-edged scenes and creepy images and abundant gore . While the look is suitable atmospheric and eerie , the plot stretches plausibility to the breaking point . The gory and bloodiest images were cut out to avoid a X-rating . This is a customary splatter plenty of grisly killing , thrills , gruesome shocks , nauseating chills and quite entertaining . It relies heavily on old-fashioned buckets of blood and the plot belongs the same of 'Slashers genre' in ¨ Halloween ¨, ¨Nightmare in Elm Street ¨, ¨ Friday 13 ¨, style . In fact , The Friday the 13th series and the plot of My Bloody Valentine is similar to the Friday the 13th films ; as it was released by Paramount attempting to do same box office . Being recently remade in 3D by Patrick Lussier , starred by Jensen Ackles ,Jaime King , Kerr Smith , Megan Boone ; the latter film being based on original directed by George Mihalka . This is an usual excruciatingly splatter film in which the intrigue , tension , suspense appears threatening and lurking in every corridor , party , mine , shaft , tunnel number 5 and many other places . This unrelenting shock-feast packs good make-up and nice special effects . It's just one long relentless stabbing and acceptable budget horror movie that still packs a punch for those who like to be terrorized out their wits . Eerie as well as frightening musical score by Paul Zaza . Atmospheric and adequate cinematography by Rodney Gibbons . The shooting location at Sydney Mines, Nova Scotia was chosen because of its rustic atmospheric appearance. The film was shot with lots of difficulties in authentic mines which were often as much as 900 feet underground , only certain lighting devices could be used in the mines because of the potential danger of methane explosions. The motion picture was professionally directed by George Mihalka . It was re-premiered at video-market in 2009 , an original uncut , then it was a real success in America and all around the world , thanks to 3 minutes gore added , even Quentin Tarantino has named My Bloody Valentine as his all-time favorite slasher film . George Mihalka is a good filmmaker and producer expert on terror and suspense genre . He has directed similar terror stories (Psychic , Relative fear ,Watchtower) . He's usually movies television director (Crossbow, Da Vinci's inquest, Windsor protocol , The Firm) and occasionally motion pictures director (Bullet to Beijing, the return of Harry Palmer , Straight Line, The Blue man, Scandale) . Rating : 6,5/10 . This murder-feast that will appeal to gore and guts aficionados .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Bloody Valentine:the 1981 (uncut) version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With having recently picked up the 2009 remake of this film,I mentioned to a friend that I was hoping to watch it very soon.To my surprise,he said that before I watch the new version,I should watch the original first (that has at last come out uncut on DVD)that he has.After watching it,I think that it is a very enjoyable slasher film,with fun special effects and a good story. The plot:After not holding a Valentines dance or party for the last twenty years ,(because when the last dance was held,two mining supervises decided to leave the group of miners early,to get to the dance as fast as they could.Sadly due to both of them not checking to see if everything is working OK,a gas leak caused a huge explosion,which led to six miners losing there lives,and the only surviving one (Harry Warden),going completely insane and going on a mini killing spree.The people that run the town decide that since that much time has gone by,and that the killer has been locked up in a mental hospital for twenty years,everyone feels that the Valentines Day dance can now return to the school.Years later:With just a few days to go,the whole town seems to be bursting with excitement,with all the students and young miners spending lots of time to make sure that every thing goes perfectly.But when the Mayor receives a mystery Valentines box,that instead of containing chocolates,contains a human heart.This leads to the Mayor and the police to start suspecting that Warden may have come back,which causes them to completely cancel the dance.Though neither of them know,that since cancelling the dance,some of the miners and students have set up a "secret" party that is being held at the mine where the explosion happened twenty years ago..View on the film: The first thing that I want to mention is the excellent new footage,which has thankfully been at last put back into the film.Whilst the extra footage is understandably a bit grainy (mostly due to it having been left on the side for thirty years)it is still able to massively improve many of the great killings in the film,with the fun practical special effects now being allowed to burst out into a full bloodbath.Whilst watching the film,I have to admit that I was very surprised that director George Mihalka had not put any nudity in this slasher,luckily he does put in a lot of very good scary killings,as well as doing very well at building tension around the activities of the events that are happening around the mines.Although John Beairos screenplay does have a few noticeable flaws (the hospital not being able to find any records about what had happened only five years ago,and an ending which is not that well explained)he is still able to delivery a very entertaining script,which really makes it feel that the killings are taking place in a very small town,that has little resources and is a place where everyone knows each other.Final view on the film:A great,fun slasher,with a good script and some fantastic killings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!!about a month ago i decided to buy all of the 80's slasher films out there. I read up on this movie and it said that it was heavily cut by the MPPA. then i went to Walmart and the DVD said that it had old footage that you could watch with the movie..... so i bought this one first!When i got home i was kind of doubting this movie, but when i started watching it my expectations were shattered! This movie is a really good movie for slasher fans. A thing I like about this movie is that its not cheapened by pointless nudity and that it is filled with true scare and chills...... like the killer breaking the lights as he walks down the mine! Overall, the acting in this movie is above average for an 80's slasher flick! It's not too gory for the gore haters but it does have its fair amount!Anyways its an overall great and scary movie! Although if your gonna watch it, watch the new DVD and not any old copy because the cut version is way worse than the uncut, and the end will have you surprised and shocked! one more thing....... "Sarah will you be my bloody valentine?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserves recognition for being part of the beginning of the Slasher golden era.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can say that this movie is one of the bests of it's genre for coming out in the perfect time, the golden slasher era (the 80's).The slasher rules were set by Black Christmas (1974), Halloween (1978), and Friday the 13th (1980). In 1981 a little low budget Canadian film took by surprise the genre by using correctly the elements that the mentioned movies created.The killer's POV, the heavy breathing, the false scares, the graphic deaths and gore, still worked pretty good here. The plot is a mix between Halloween (a massacre on a celebration day as Valentine's Day) and Friday the 13th (a killer takes revenge on everyone on a specific date). This movie was released by Paramount the same year as the company's strong horror film Friday the 13th part 2. In fact there's a clear reference in "My Bloody Valentine" to Friday the 13th as the killings happened on Saturday February the 14th. Is this movie a good contender against Friday the 13th part 2?. It's matter of opinions.*SPOILERS*An urban legend states that a survivor from a mine accident took revenge on the men responsible by killing them for not taking care of the mine's security. These men didn't prevent the accident because they were on a Valentine's Day party at the same time.The killer cursed Valentine's Day by telling everyone in town to never celebrate it. Twenty years have passed and the local government and society decide to throw a Valentine's Day party! Obviously ignoring the tragic events that happened 20 years before. As it was the early 80's and the standards for having fun were shown in these movies, the audience witness horny teens drinking alcohol and having sex for fun. Another rule in slasher movies: Anyone that has sex and drinks gets killed. This isn't the exception. Days before the party, someone sent bleeding hearts inside heart shaped boxes to the organizers of the party. These horrible messages were again ignored by the organizers and the result was a gruesome massacre the day of the party. One by one the teens that had their celebration in the mine were killed by the (supposedly) dead mine worker. Did this man come from the grave and kill again because of the society's lack of respect to his curse? Is it possible that a copycat killer wants to ruin the celebration? What could be the relation between the killer and the victims? What's the real motive for the killer to slaughter the teens in the mine? These questions are answered with blood. *END OF SPOILERS* Comments based on the awaited un cut version. "My Bloody Valentine" is a more than decent slasher. There's plenty of gore and brutal deaths, loyal to the early 80's violence standards. The killer is somewhat scary as his status on earth is not clear. The acting is simply good and delivers expectations for a slasher movie. The score is very good, a mix of thrilling sounds with early 80's dance. Stuff for nostalgia. The chasing sequences and not expected kills were also good. Overall this is a very good horror film, one of the first slashers to ever get a very well deserved recognition. Get this movie, buy it if possible, as it's part of the slasher movies history and it's also a good horror movie.7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good and effectively creepy early 80's seasonal slasher flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The stupendous success of John Carpenter's holiday horror slasher classic "Halloween" not surprisingly beget a rash of similar seasonal slice'n'dice fright flicks. "My Bloody Valentine" is one of the better low-budget copies made at the height of the early 80's teen body count craze. The story is nothing special, but it does the trick just the same: A homicidal killer (juicily played to the deranged hilt by Neil Affleck) goes on a grisly murder spree in the bleak little mining town of Valentine Bluffs on February 14th. Although routinely plotted and pretty predictable, this baby nonetheless still rates as an above average entry thanks to George ("Pick-up Summer") Mihalka's strong direction, solid acting from the entire cast (said cast deserve extra kudos for looking, speaking and behaving like credibly rough-around-the-edges working class young adults; I especially liked the goofy curly-haired fat guy who resembled a young Avery Schrieber), genuinely personable characters, gory make-up f/x by Tom ("The Beast Within") Burman, a truly creepy and hauntingly downbeat atmosphere (the sequences in the underground mine in particular have a potently clammy and claustrophobic spookiness to them), Paul ("Prom Night") Zaza's eerie score, Rodney Gibbons' impressively slick cinematography, and a respectable corpse tally of 10. And that groovy folkie ending credits theme song is an absolute hoot!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Interesting Slasher Films of the 1980s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"My Bloody Valentine" has seemed to gain something of a cult status in modern day, and I've heard so much about this movie (mainly from an acquaintance who considers this one of the best slashers of all time) so I finally gave in and decided to watch it, and I was very pleased with what this spooky little slasher flick had to offer.The film is about a small mining town, Valentine Bluffs. 20 years earlier, five men were killed in a horrible mining accident because the two watchmen who were supposed to keep control of the methane levels left their post to join the Valentine's dance early. Seeking revenge, a miner who survived the accident, Harry Warden, slaughtered the two watchmen responsible, even going so far as to ripping out their hearts and placing them in heart-shaped candy boxes. Now, a Valentine's dance is being planned, despite the warning that Harry Warden would return to kill anyone involved with another celebration. When the city council calls off the dance after the murder of a laundromat owner, the unhappy teens decide to throw a party on their own. It's all fun and games throughout the night, but then people start to turn up dead, and a group of kids decide to head down to the old mine for fun. Can the remaining teens be saved before Harry Warden takes his bloody revenge? Or will more hearts be broken?I have to admit, for a slasher flick, this movie has some pretty good thought and creativity put into it. The story is unlike any I've heard (although it does borrow ideas from other slasher films), and the movie was pretty original for the most part. Being released in the shadow of the previous year's "Friday the 13th", this film didn't get as much recognition in my opinion, which is too bad. On the bright side, it has gained notoriety over the years, which is nice. One thing that really stands out here is the villain of the film - Harry Warden (or is it?), clad in a mining suit, complete with the gas mask and wielding a very threatening pick axe. It's surprising that he didn't gain a larger place in horror celluloid, because he's pretty interesting as far as horror movie villains go.The acting was a mixed bag, but most of the performances were decent for a slasher movie - nothing too unbearable here. I thoroughly enjoyed the underground mine sequence in the last 30 minutes of the film, it was creepy, strangely claustrophobic, and well-done. And the boiling heart in the hot dog pan was a really clever touch. The ending to the film was a surprise, and the final few minutes were really memorable, especially that chilling last shot echoed over with "Sarah, will you be my bloody valentine?". Unfortunately, there was quite a bit of footage cut from the film, and because of it some of the murders seemed noticeably incomplete. The MPAA's concern for the film's violent content would probably explain this, and that's really too bad.Overall, "My Bloody Valentine" is a really good '80s slasher film, and the first horror film with a basis on the Valentine's Day holiday. Basically, if you enjoy a good slasher flick, you're guaranteed to like this one. While it isn't a cinematic masterpiece, it's extremely good (and entertaining) considering the type of film that it is, and contains enough little interesting touches to put it ahead of its fellow slasher counterparts. One of the best slasher films from the '80s, and worth a look from genre fans. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neither scary, nor original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the cover, I thought it was a good teen slasher movie. Well it was a slasher movie but it wasn't good at all.First, it's not original at all. It's the story of many horror movies; revenge. Then it needed some good sound effects. For example when Mabel fell out of the washing machine, they could have done a little high sound effect to make us jump.But the thing I hated most about it that it's too predictable. You could easily tell who will stay alive. And when they heard Axel shouting and they found his torch in the water, I knew immediately that he had something to do with it.Well it's not one of those unbearable boring movies at all, but it needs much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better then the 2009 remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched this during my time in High School in 2009 and I have to say this movie's story was just so good that 28 years later, at the time when I was watching it, it can still scare people. The atmosphere at a coal mine was just great work and it really gives that dark, grim look of something bad is about to happen. There is a few tacky love scenes here and there but it doesn't drag the story away from the main plot, unlike the 2009 remake where it's just more talking and less killing and being easily predictable for how the way the story was portrayed. Here, this movie scared me! The guy who played as Harry Warden did an excellent job when he was found under the mine blast. In the end, I prefer this over the 2009 remake and I think its stupid how a sequel was never made for this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Something about this film makes me re-watch it at least once a year. Like Young Frankenstein, Deliverance and Thief, it appeals to me beyond the confines of its genre (in this case, 80s Slasher-Horror Fare.) The plotting, settings, scenery, black humor and ensemble of actors are hitting on all cylinders in this underrated Canadian gem. What could've ended up as just another cookie-cutter Halloween holiday-themed ripoff stands decapitated head and shoulders above its peers. The "teens" in this flick are actually young adults and that helps move the narrative into areas of regret, failure and yearning for something beyond the small-town life for our lead characters. Check it out. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great 1980s horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the little mining town of Valentines Bluff two miners handsome T.J. (Paul Kelman) and Axel (Neil Affleck) are competing for the affections of Sarah (Lori Hallier) as Valentines Day approaches. Also it seems there's a guy wandering around in a miners outfit killing off people because the town is celebrating Valentines Day despite a terrible tragedy that happened 20 years ago.The plot is a little bit confused but it doesn't matter--this is a great little horror film. I first saw it in 1981 in a huge theatre in Boston on opening night. It was cut to ribbons by the MPAA--most of the gory murders were cut down to nothing or left out entirely. But the film had a creepy atmosphere, some pretty good acting (Canadian accents aside) and the last 45 minutes take place in a mine and REALLY work in a dark theatre. The ending was predictable but there was a real jolt before the closing credits. Hell, even the song playing over the closing credits was good and spooky! This was reissued uncut in 2009 and I can see why the gore was cut out originally. The violence is strong and brutal but helps the film as a whole. There's no stupid comic relief either. This did not do well when it came out but has acquired a cult following over the years. Worth seeing. Try watching the last 45 minutes in a totally dark room for maximum impact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric and creepy Canadian slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know everyone has already mentioned it, but Christ, them a**holes at the MPAA really ruined this film when it was first released. Director George Mihalka claimed that the MPAA cut nine minutes of violence and gore from the original cut - which means that every murder scene in the film is edited and chopped (no pun intended) up so badly that it is a miracle that the film still managed to look good. Hats off the boys and girls in the editing department. Lionsgate purchased the rights to the film from Paramount in 2009, around the time when the remake was released, and they miraculously recovered the missing footage and added about two and half minutes of violence and gore that was missing. Which contradicts Mihalka's earlier claim that the MPAA had cut more, well, whatever - if you are fortunate enough to see this uncut, it is one brutal and gory film, let me tell you. This is all down to the fantastic work done by make-up artist Tom Burman. "My Bloody Valentine" is discredited by many people and frowned upon as being a "Friday the 13th" wannabe... what with the similar storyline and the fact that it is pretty much just cashing in on the last holiday that was available (Halloween had been trick or treated - "Halloween" and Christmas had been carved - "Black Christmas") so that left Valentines Day after Friday the 13th. I watched it the other day for the second time having seen it years before, and I must say, I loved it. I loved it's unusual location - the Sydney Mines in Nova Scotia, Canada - which provides a unique and isolated location for the mayhem to ensue, and the acting is surprisingly decent.A small town in Canada called Valentine's Bluff hasn't celebrated Valentine's Day in over twenty years, owing to a disaster down in the town's mine twenty years ago which seen a group of miners buried beneath the earth after two safety men slacked off work to attend the Valentine's Day party. It took them a couple of weeks to dig the miners out, and only one of them was still alive when they got down to them. Harry Warden had survived by eating the limbs of his dead co-workers, and he went insane and has spent the last twenty years in a mental hospital. A group of teenagers have worked hard in organsier a dance for this year, and the entire town is decorated for the event, as the Mayor has decided that they should move on and forget what has become a legend and a boogeyman in the town. But two days before the dance, people start getting murdered, and the Mayor and the Sheriff both receive chocolate boxes with a human heart and a riddle of warning in them. As the events unfold, the teenagers find themselves trapped in the mine as Harry Warden is back with his pick-axe, seeking revenge on the town once again for what happened...Atmospheric and highly suspenseful, "My Bloody Valentine" serves to be one of the better slashers of the 1980's - if not the best. In my opinion, it's better than "Friday the 13th".... there, I said it, now I'll just wait for the idiots to start clicking 'no' at the bottom of this review... Anyway, I recommend if you haven't seen this film already to check out the uncut version released two years ago. That way then you won't be disappointed by the murder sequences which are built up very well, but alas, because of the MPAA and their bitchy nature, we were denied their blood 'n guts finale back in the good old 80's. However, it still doesn't take away from this atmospheric and grim classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MBV Wipes The Floor With Every Other 80's Slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The early 80's received a pile of interesting slashers. Time is cemented with the titles of such great films as The Burning, Halloween, The Prowler and the rather stupid Friday The 13th.However criminally overlooked My Bloody Valentine is the best of them.Lost inside F13's popularity in 1981, MBV went mostly unwatched. However it's unique premise and deliciously devilish kills deserved as much, if not more praise than those of F13.Remade in 2009, the plot focuses on a mass murder legend in a small town on Valentine's Day. As always a group of teenagers decides to do something stupid and the supposed dead killer returns.It's one of my favorite slashers, not without small flaws, but still entertaining and better than most the 80's had to offer. I highly recommend it over the severely mediocre remake.Also, try to pick up the DVD version. It's got all the uncensored gore scenes. ;) 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The newly-restored version of this splatter outing may very well capture a piece of your heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine is a glaring example of how a splatter film with a solid premise could be rendered virtually useless by an over-zealous MPAA. In its original "R" rated incarnation, MBV is a tedious and tame mess that is bound to be a disappointment, since genre fans have a right to expect a movie with "Bloody" in the title to feature at least a modicum of gore. However, a Special Edition DVD release of this modest whodunnit restores nearly 3 minutes of previously excised footage, and the updated version proves to be a pleasantly entertaining addition to the splatter canon.3 minutes may not sound like much, but when you consider that the entirety of this span is comprised of snippets of bloodletting, the formerly missing footage adds to the film tremendously. While My Bloody Valentine is assuredly a straight-forward slasher flick that offers nothing fans of the formula haven't already seen countless times before, the gruesome bits that the Special Edition re-inserts provide the cheap thrills that the original presentation of the film was sorely lacking.Even without the truncated gore, the film already had some nice elements working for it. The set-up for the murders is a nifty twist on the usual mad killer formula, and placing the second half of the film deep underground in seemingly endless mine-shafts creates a gloomy and claustrophobic atmosphere that serves the largely predictable affair well. While the twist ending falls a bit flat, the film-makers at least thought about the plot enough to try one out, so MBV offers just a tad more than your standard slice-and-dice exercise.Don't get me wrong, there's still silliness galore on display here. For instance, setting the film in a town called "Valentine Bluffs" must have sounded novel on paper, but it comes across as a pretty lame ploy when you hear it in the movie. Far too much attention is paid to a needless love triangle subplot, and that melodramatic aspect threatens to derail the entire movie at times. My favorite sophomoric moment arrives when an amorous couple breaks off from the group for a little mineshaft nookie, at which point the over-eager beau announces that they'll meet back up with everyone else in 10 minutes (smooth, dude... nothing makes a girl feel more special than finding out she's desirable enough to deserve a span of ecstasy roughly equivalent to the amount of time it takes to make a sandwich). There's also a folk song that runs over the closing credits, which actually recounts the movie's entire plot; I'm still trying to figure out whether that's brilliant or obnoxious.Elsewhere, the film doesn't stray from its roots very often, and there's rarely a moment when we aren't abundantly certain that the main purpose of the movie was to cash in on the abundant demand for dead teenager flicks in the early '80s. For anyone familiar with the genre, only a couple of the telegraphed murders will have much impact, and the ensemble of depth-less young adult archetypes will no doubt bring about a sense a deja vu if you've seen even one Friday the 13th entry. However, with the deleted gore scenes reinstated, My Bloody Valentine often pays off in a big way. Kills that were rendered confusing in the "R" version are now presented in all their unrated glory in the Special Edition, and set-pieces like one poor lass being turned into a human shower head and a meddling prankster getting his eye gouged out by a well-placed pick-axe, both nearly absent from the original release, are played out in their entirety. Even in its restored state, MBV certainly isn't the goriest film in the '80s slasher canon, but these fleshed out scenes add some genuine thrills to what was a rather rote and toothless entry, and the film is bolstered immeasurably by its reunion with the cutting room floor.Sadly, MBV bears the scars of its restoration, and the decreased picture and audio quality of the replaced frames makes them easy to spot (one girl's screams are so buried in the soundtrack that we end up getting the impression that being gored in the stomach with a pick-axe produces only minor discomfort). One of the originally trimmed murders is extremely murky in its uncut state, and I'm still unsure exactly what happened to the victims (it looks like they were speared by a giant corkscrew, but I'm not sure where the killer got one so massive, or why he took it down into the mineshaft).Uncut or not, My Bloody Valentine is still far from perfect, but fans of the early-'80s splatter cycle will likely glean plenty of enjoyment from this decent descent. The 2009 remake ultimately handled this same material much better, but this humble slasher has enough positive attributes to ensure that the 90 minutes of your life you spend here won't be wasted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Bloody Valentine: A Slasher Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(This review is for the UNCUT version) When i first watched My Bloody Valentine, (i had rented it) i fell in love with it. MBV immediately be came come of my favorite slasher films. Any slasher fan should see this slasher that has it all, well except for sex/nudity. Since the film was cut, it hurt the film. Us slasher fans begged and prayed for a miracle....our prayers were answered by Lionsgate. Finally, one company stepped up to release the UNCUT version.When I first popped in the DVD, i was extremely excited. After the film was done, i was amazed. I had seen a whole different slasher film. My Bloody Valentine UNCUT is now a classic slasher, or even classic horror film! The gore is fantastic! You see it all! Nail-gun to the head, pickaxe thru the breast, pickaxe thru the chin and out the eye. Everything! My Bloody Valentine UNCUT is a mandatory viewing for any slasher fan. I would rank it up there (in terms of violence/gore) with The Prowler and The Burning.Highly Recommended! 10 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you can do it with Christmas and Halloween, why not Valentines Day too?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The number of slasher films from the 1970s and 80s is countless. You'd have to catalogue them to keep track. You'd also have to put them into categories like "camp slasher" and "supernatural slasher." Now the one that seems to be the most popular, then and now, is the Holiday themed portion of the subgenre, which began in the early 1970s with films like 'Black Christmas' and 'Silent Night, Bloody Night.' Then of course we have 1978s 'Halloween.' Once the biggies were used up horror movie makers started using the rest, and sometimes special days like the senior prom. So it was just a matter of time before the most romantic day of the year became the theme for a slasher film and a good one at that.Pros: Performances are fine. Director Mihalka injects some style into this and does a great job of making things creepy. A scary villain. Fast-paced. An adequate score. Some great murder sequences. Good amount of blood and gore. A few effective jump scares.Cons: Too many characters to keep track of and most are so thinly written you won't care about them. Little suspense or surprises. Kind of a lame twist.Final thoughts: Who would have thought that Valentine's Day could be such a dark day? Though maybe not among the top 10 slasher films of the 80s, this is absolutely a must for genre nuts. It's a good old fashioned bloody, spooky, guilty pleasure like they don't make anymore.My rating: 3.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the better 80's slashers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Plot = The quiet mining town of Valentine's Bluff is trying to live down its tragic past. Twenty years ago on the night of their annual Valentine's dance an accident occurred in the mines. Two neglectful supervisors decided to start partying early and forgot to check the methane gas levels. Six men were trapped in the resulting cave in. The only survivor was one Harry Warden who resorted to cannibalism to survive and went mad in the process. The next year Harry returned to exact revenge on those responsible, and to warn the town to never throw a dance again unless they wanted more bloodshed. Legend has it that every year he comes home to make sure his threat is needed. After 19 years the town decides enough is enough and starts decorating the streets and hanging up flyers promising a dance. That's when the Valentine boxes begin to arrive with bloody human hearts nestled inside, and good old Mabel who's helped with the decorations is found burned to a crisp at the laundromat. Again the festivities are cancelled but a group of young folks make the unfortunate decision to throw their own party in the very place where Harry's troubles began, in the mines. One by one the revelers are dispatched in horrifically clever, gruesome ways. Has Harry returned or does someone else have a pickaxe to grind? This is definitely one of the better 80's slashers, you could not find a better example of an early 80's slasher if you tried and "My Blood Valentine" follows the previous year's Friday The 13th's format closely. In fact, the dance actually takes place on Saturday the 14th! But it's savvy enough to add its own spin to the proceedings. The local boogey man legend, the doom saying old timers, and the post coital murders are all present but so is a rather original setting (the mines), a compelling love triangle and a somewhat earnest take on a working class dead end town. Harry Warden himself is an inspired creation, the flashback scenes of his figure roaming about in the fog clad in mining gear complete with head lantern and pick axe, create an image that is a perfect marriage of classic and modern horror.The acting in this movie is really good Paul Kerman (TJ) and Neil Afflect (Axel) both gives well rounded performances Lori Hallier (Sara) gives the strongest performance, she comes out of this one a winner adding depth and warmth to her character and making her believable and likable Keith Knight (Hollis) the token fat guy was great and that prankster guy whose name I can't remember he was one of my faves in the movie and Patty was OK too.All in all This is a Slasher flick which may not be original but brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody is the word (for the eighties, anyway)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'My Bloody Valentine.' A slasher. There's not an awful lot more to say. If you've grown up over recent years and are generally interested in the genre, you'll find that this little offering from 1981 is pretty tame in comparison to what's released today. However, back when 'video nasties' were just taking off, this was pretty strong stuff! A small-time mining town in America has a legend (don't they all?) ? this one tells of a miner who went berserk years ago on Valentine's day and killed a bunch of people. Now, several years later ? guess what ? it looks like he's back.Normally, this is where I say that the cast is made up of oversexed, annoyingly attractive teenagers. But not this time. Here we have oversexed, annoying UGLY teenagers. Don't ask me why (and I promise you that I'm no oil painting!) but this must be the ugliest group of leading actors every assembled to be chopped up by a nut-job with a gas mask and pick axe. I guess we can blame it on the eighties. Or the lack of budget needed to bring bigger (and more physically attractive) stars on board.Yes, one by one our facially-challenged heroes are chopped up in various hideous ways. Nothing too new there, apart from the fact that the death scenes seem a little more violent for the time than your average Friday 13th film. Notice I don't say 'gruesome' ? only violent. I mentioned the budget earlier and it seems like they didn't really have enough money for expert make-up and prosthetics needed for the gore. I suppose it's the way it's filmed that makes it so violent. There seems like there's a real sense of nastiness in the deaths.Not that you'll care much about those getting sliced and diced. They really are pretty irritating. If Jar-Jar Binks was a little less computer-generated and a little more eighties then those are the people getting murdered here.Perhaps one thing that the film does have going for it is that you don't actually know who's under the gas mask. In that was it's more akin to the 'Scream' franchise in as much as like a who-done-it.There's not much new here (especially nearly forty years later!), but if you're into the slasher genre in general and like to see where this type of film found its roots, then give this a try. The gore isn't really there and the violence ? although strong for the time ? has also diminished, the mystery element may make it worth an hour and a half of your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No need to recap the familiar plot. It's an effective slasher movie that really picks up steam in the last half hour. Filming the climactic scenes in a real coal mine creates an appropriately hellish setting. After all, who knows what's lying ahead in those creepy tunnels. Sarah, TJ, and co. sure should have stayed out of this underworld and remained topside now that their numbers are dwindling. But you've got to hand it to a no-name cast that proves surprisingly convincing whether as party animals or bleeding corpses. Then too, I like the way Harry Warden's otherwise motiveless killing spree is motivated. It's really revenge for partying twenty years earlier when the guards should have been looking out for the miners below. On the other hand, I could have done without the bleeding hearts, but I guess that was to tease us along until the slam-bang finale. Anyway, kudos to director Mihalka who not only gets surprisingly good performances for a slasher film, but also keeps thing moving. All in all, it's an imaginatively effective horror movie that shows what a Canadian production crew can do.</fullReview>

Some of the characters where killed off camera which is obviously a censorship issue which if made today probably wouldn't happen. We also had a couple of characters Howard and Sylvia who had little introduction and then promptly slaughtered.The other issue i had with My bloody valentine was the thin motive the killer had we get a brief reveal at the end but is hardly satisfying.Your common or garden slasher movie the killer has his trademark kill, here victims are dispatched using various ingenious methods, which we are not allowed to see.Now that the movie is over 30 years old it needs a re submission to the censors like others of the time and the cuts re-addressed to make the movie more complete.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Getting to the Heart of the Matter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story essentially begins in a small mining town called "Valentine Bluffs" with 5 miners and 2 supervisors going deep into a mine shaft to work just prior to their traditional St. Valentine's Day party that night. Eager to begin festivities the 2 supervisors depart a little early and let the 5 miners continue working without them. Not long afterward an explosion rips through the tunnel which causes the mine shaft to collapse. Eventually, after 6 weeks of effort, the rescuers finally get to those trapped inside only to find one survivor named "Harry Warden" (Peter Cowper) who has managed to stay alive by feeding on his comrades. He has also gone quite insane. One year later, Harry Warden returns to Valentine Bluffs and goes on a killing spree which results in the town permanently terminating all celebrations for that specific day. Twenty years later the townsfolk decide to resume their traditional dance-and the killings start again. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought this was one of the better "slasher movies" from this particular era. Although the gore isn't as big a factor as others films of this time, the mystery and suspense manage to keep things interesting just the same. Likewise, the drama between "Axel" (Neil Affleck) and "T.J." (Paul Kelman) as suitors for "Sarah" (Lori Hallier) helped the overall story as well. On the flip side, I didn't particularly care for the ending which seemed much too abrupt. But other than that this was a fairly entertaining film and I rate it as slightly above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As stylish as it is brutal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NOTE: This film was recommended to me by Bethany Rose for the "Steve Pulaski Sees It." Perhaps if released in the late 1980's, or even the 1990's, George Mihalka's My Bloody Valentine would've been a film many slasher fans would've sneered at; it would've likely been a film dismissed as "more of the same" in a genre unwilling to subvert its more predictable principles to become something greater. Being released in 1981, however, when the slasher film was still a fairly new concept, My Bloody Valentine is actually a very significant for the time period. It's one of the few films of that era that didn't spawn a legion of sequels, let alone even a followup, and managed to tell its story and wrap it up without the feeling that it needed to build a cult of support and development around its pickaxe-wielding killer. It's a film that tells its story and leaves its mark.The story is set in the small town of Valentine Bluffs, which is preparing for a Valentine's Day dance, the first in man years. A working class town where most men work as coal miners, the Valentine's Day dance was a popular event in the town before a mining accident occurred twenty years before. On-the-job negligence resulted in five men being trapped underground amidst dangerous level of methane gas. While four of the miners died, one survivor named Harry Warden survived through cannibalistic acts and was eventually rescued. A year later, after never being seen again, Harry exacted revenge on the supervisors that were responsible for the accident, killing them both and slicing through their chests to extract their hearts, which he left in Valentine boxes to be found; he warned Valentine Bluffs never to hold another dance again.With Harry being locked in an asylum and a new generation of spry young kids wanting to commemorate Valentine's Day with a dance, the town complies and hosts another dance. Once again, as foreshadowed by a few of the older townspeople, murders begin happening by a man in a gas-mask wielding a pickaxe; Harry has presumably returned to avenge a town that has disobeyed his only wish.My Bloody Valentine is rather dark and methodical for a slasher film, unwilling to commit to a more light-hearted aura like many of its successors would. Its fabulously paced score of synths and melodic music, composed by Paul Zaza creates actual suspense in conjunction with Mihalka's direction, which is filled with original camera-angles. Consider the closeups we see of the murderer, and the utterly gruesome deaths we see with an unblinking eye. Mihalka was going for something completely frightening and unapologetically terrifying with the mood he creates here, and it isn't until one sees this film after watching more comical entries into the genre that they realize what a breakthrough this film was, staying true to slasher films' original roots of being frightening, atmospheric, and tense.The narrative is just believable enough to keep one watching, as it's not crafted in total randomness, and the deaths are just brutal enough to warrant some legitimate scares or jolts. Seasoned horror fans and cult followers will take note that pressures from the MPAA forced Mihalka to edit and scale-back his film significantly in the gore-department, and Mihalka's original cut, despite being filmed, has never been released to the public. An extended cut was released on DVD to coincide with the film's remake in 2009, adding three minutes to the film's original version, despite never releasing the completely untampered original.With that, My Bloody Valentine is a particularly strong slasher because, for one, it recognizes its genre and respectfully handles its scares and its material, and secondly, plays along with the tropes by making this a heavily stylized slasher in aesthetic and atmosphere. It manages to be gruesome quite often, but elegant throughout, and with such a brutal concept, it's surprising that the result is so quaint.Starring: Paul Kelman, Lori Hallier, and Neil Affleck. Directed by: George Mihalka.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Bloody Valentine(Uncut)- A Killer Thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the small town of Valentine Bluffs everyone is getting ready for the big Valentine's Dance. It will be the first one in over 20 years, since the tragedy. In 1960 a terrible mining accident happened on Valentine's Day. On the day of the accident two supervisors were careless, and 5 people died. The only survivor was Harry Warden, who vowed to get even with the two that left him there to die, so they could get to the dance. He later found those two supervisors killed them, ripping out their hearts. He told the community that if there were another Valentine's Day Dance he would come back and kill everyone. Harry ended up spending several years in a mental hospital. It is now 1980, and the first Valentine's Day dance is going to be held regardless. Almost everyone believe Harry Warden is either dead or just a legend. Most of the people work at the Hanniger Mine; and can't wait to start helping with the decorating. As soon as the decorations begin the dance organizer Mabel is brutality murdered. Chief Newby tries to cover it up, so it won't start a panic . So after Mabel's murder, Newby calls off the dance which leads to disappointment. After her death the local bar tender knows exactly what happened.He believes Harry's back and everyone should wise up and listen to him. He explains that it isn't a fairy tale and they will be sorry. Naturally everyone thinks he's bulls**ting and ignore the scare tactic. The bartender worked in the mine back when the collapse happened, he was one of the men who found Harry.Later he tries to make believer's out of them by scaring them, but it backfires. So the gang ignores the advice and hold a Valentine's party at the mine. Once they arrive the terror and killings continue until the real killer is caught. Could it be one of there own? I love this movie, the uncut version is the only one to watch though. To get the real effect of the film the uncut is a must, the R rating is practically PG. I was young at the time so I don't know what the big brew ha ha was with Paramount, since they put out Friday the 13th a year earlier. That film was much more frighting. If the uncut scenes were left MBV would have done so must better at the box office.THX, Kris L. CocKayne</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't mine him, he still hearts you.Ahhh, I miss the 80s slashers, whether they were about the holidays or not. Funny thing is, what I complain about today's endless supply of haunted house/ghost horror films, is what I liked about most of the 80s masked killer movies: clichés and A-B-C scripts. So many clichés, too predictable. And I can't get enough of them.This one, however, followed most of the formulas of the other holiday massacres, but was a little elevated in the creative kills and gore. Some of it even shocked me today, three and a half decades later, and that says a lot for how many horror movies I've seen.So we have Harry Warden who hacked up some losers who left him for dead in a mine twenty years back. Since then, the town of, ah-hem, Valentine Bluffs, is forbidden to hold their signature dance or Harry will come back to kill, for whatever reason since he's already received his revenge. Well, like most tasteless jokes, it's been 20 years, so why not have another dance?Big mistake. Huge. The killer miner is back with a new vengeance and as in the good-ole-Jaws days, the Sheriff is more concerned with keeping the town alive than the people living within it.There's not much more to say. If you love 80s slashers like I do, this is a must see. I really think they pushed the boundaries than most of the other holiday horror flicks of that time. Heck, I love the Friday the 13th franchise, but never remember them being as, um, bloody as this one.***Final thoughts: In unusual fashion for me, I saw the remake in 2009 first and then, saw this maybe 4-5 years later. I really had a good time with the reboot, especially in (finally!) effective 3D. But, this, now being only my second time seeing it, still holds up and does warm my? HEART?of 80s nostalgia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Working in a mining town, a series of grisly murders leads to a legendary serial killer stalking a secretive party at a local mine and forces them to fight him off in order to get out of the party alive.This is one of the best of the 80s-era slashers. Among the better qualities is the watchable first half that has a lot to like, which starts off quite well with the initial town back-story on the holiday as the accident and eventual slaughter afterward go hand-in-hand with all the decorations and set-up done for the celebration in the present time. That creates an impending aura of chills and suspense in this when the few localized murders take place and the gag of the heart-shaped boxes are left behind at the crime scenes furthers this really nicely to create that full-on sense of dread here. That the second half tends to really ramp up the suspense factor from this early set-up enables a near non-stop amount of tense and thrilling stalking scenes throughout the party upstairs and the mine-tunnels below, as both manage absolutely fantastic scenes that follow a pretty simple pattern. The party tends to rely on quick shock scenes including the hot-dog water and the body in the freezer whereas the protracted stalking underground really amps up the suspense for some utterly masterful scenes. The chase through the falling suits, the extended chase through the tunnels and plenty of encounters throughout provide this with scores of scenes that take effective use of the genuinely creepy setting of the mine to load this up with great scenes in this section. These suspenseful scenes are augmented by the fine action throughout here with all the chasing, encounters and a thrilling pickax battle that reads a lot like a sword-fight, a marvelously designed and wholly chilling killer and plenty of gruesome deaths to really round out the film's positives. About the only thing here that doesn't work is the tedious love-triangle storyline that runs through the first half of this. These scenes are just bland and really grind the movie to a halt instead of really letting the intended drama that's festering beneath the surface come out naturally. Beyond this issue, there's a whole lot to like here that doesn't mean much.Rated R: Graphic Violence, some Language, Brief Nudity and suggested sexual activity and dialog.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine (1981) is one of the "slasher" greats, in my opinion. However, when I first watched the film, I found it to be quite predictable up until the ending. Want to know why the remake was horrible? Because it didn't feature "The Ballad of Harry Warden." I was surprised a sequel wasn't attempted, given that the ending basically was open for a follow-up. By the way, I'm Nova Scotian and a filmmaker. A horror filmmaker. This film will always be an influence. I found the image of the real Harry Warden murdering Axel's father, dark in tone. It contributed greatly to the film. I gave this film nine out of ten, because, like I mentioned earlier, I found it quite predictable.

		<shortDescription>Bloody awful. I've had scarier kebabs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arguably since 'Black Christmas' (1974), and certainly since 'Halloween' (1978), films in the slasher genre have been distinguished by a strict set of tropes. Namely: a horrific event kept secret by the guardians of a community; the anniversary of said event sometime later; a deranged killer that typically uses a sharp object as a weapon; a group of good-looking teens who fail to heed the warnings from the guardians and are thus killed in gloriously grotesque ways; the "final girl" ? the surviving member of the group, usually female. Most slashers largely follow this template and the joy of a good slasher is not to see how they avoid these genre conventions?but rather seeing how they embrace them and embellish them. However, 'My Bloody Valentine' is bitterly disappointing in that, despite its high regard among many slasher fans, it simply trots out the format related above in the blandest and most uninspiring of ways.The film begins with the community preparing for its first Valentine's Ball in 20 years; however, the mayor is keen to play down this fact as, through a weak exposition scene, we're told that a mining accident 20 years before was caused by supervising workers neglecting their duty and going to the Ball. During the accident lots of men died and one man, Harry Warden, survived through recourse to cannibalism and, the following year, took his revenge on the two supervisors by cutting out their hearts and warning the town not to have a dance ever again. At the same time the town is preparing for its revived Valentine's Ball, a young man called TJ has just returned from a failed trip out west to find that his girlfriend Sarah has taken up with his friend, Axel, in his absence. Relations are strained but everybody is looking forward to the party which is unfortunately cancelled when people start dying again and their hearts are sent to the mayor and police chief in heart-shaped boxes. Undeterred, the youngsters decide to stage their own party (at the mine, obviously) which is when the real massacre begins.The set up sounds absolutely fine, intriguing even, but in EVERY regard the movie fails in the execution. It is paced very slowly as it takes a long time for the killings to really kick in but in the meantime the limp script fails to engage us in the characters or flesh out the back-story. In fact, half-way through I began to wonder if the woeful acting is suffocating a standard script, or if half-way decent actors are doing their best with a limp script (the screenwriter John Beaird also did 'Happy Birthday to Me' the same year which also suffers from the should've been much, much better charge). Although the answer is probably both. Either way, I couldn't have cared less as the kids are offed (apart from the older guy, Hollis, for some reason) and the reveal of the killer was rendered a dud as it was basically broadcast since the middle of the film. Inextricably entwined in this web of blandness is the total lack of atmosphere, even during the climax down the mine.The sad thing about it is that the movie very easily could've been an utter classic. The mining town setting, for example, is an outstanding idea criminally left to rot; I can imagine a Dario Argento or Wes Craven utilising the mine as a complex metaphor for the labyrinthine passageways of the subconscious mind filled with all our personal and collective dark, repressed desires. Instead, the mine is utilised as?a mine. That's just weak. Even the "final girl" trope: down the mine it looks like Sarah is doing the "facing upto extreme situations" bit and then it just falls flat and she ends up watching the two guys duke it out.Like many movies in the genre, 'My Bloody Valentine' has maintained a certain notoriety in being cut extensively in regard to the graphic kills. However, even in this regard, while the kills demonstrate some modicum of cool make-up effects, they lack the all-out Tom Savini style gore that enabled 'Friday the 13th' to rise above its limitations which, combined with the utter absence of suspense, renders the kills pedestrian in my opinion.From the notoriety and good-standing the film has with slasher fans, and the setting with the mine, I really expected to like this movie but it lacks everything a good slasher should have. Watch it if, like me, you like going through the back catalogue of Golden Age slashers, but otherwise I wouldn't lose sleep over not watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slasher films from the 1980s are legion for they are many, unsurprisingly the quality varies and the advent of time has dimmed their impact somewhat. My Bloody Valentine is middle of the road, blighted by cuts to its gore scenes, it's a film that has had to work hard to earn its cult following. It's a good old stalk and slash revenger based around a coal mine where a tragedy happened many moons ago. The mystery element is strong enough to maintain interest, and although the formula is consistently one dimensional for the genre of the time, it operates well above average for the gore and blood hounds.There's some bad acting and some even worse moustaches! While expectation of a hidden slasher gem will only end in disappointment. But what it does it does well and a good time is assured for the undemanding horror peeps. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Movie of All Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was filmed in my hometown, and is an amazing creepy film. It's really fun to watch with friends, the soundtrack is wonderful (sadly never released). In the fictional town of Valentine Bluffs, in 1960 a group of seven coal miners were trapped for six weeks in a mine shaft due to the negligence of their foremen involving a Valentine's Day party. Harry Warden was the only survivor; he lived by eating his six co-workers and was sent to an asylum, only to go on a killing spree after his release. Now the town is suffering twenty years later from losing its residents to the west coast where more work is, and it is decided that it is time to put aside the stories and have a Valentine's Day party. A group of miners and girls in their twenties decide to go into the coal mines during the party, but Harry is down there, ready to grab them... All the acting was very well-done and the killing scenes were both disturbing and original. I've been to most of the places where the filming took place and the movie really managed to capture the eerie and dreary small-town feeling of Cape Breton's industrial areas. Paul Zaza, the music composer, did a fantastic job. This version, the original, is much better than the 2009 remake of the film. The filming was amazing when you consider that the underground coal mine chase scenes were filmed several feet below ground in a very dangerous condition. I highly recommend watching this, it's a great movie, comedic at some points, romantic, and at some points very scary and serious, a great slasher film that should be viewed by everyone at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vicious and bloody Killer is a minor classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By 1981 the slasher film craze started by John Carpenter's influential "Halloween" could be felt throughout the genre and everyone was jumping on the bandwagon. From independent films to big studios every holiday on the calendar was being used as an excuse to have a crazed killer stalking, usually teenagers. Paramount studios already struck gold with "Friday the 13th" and then moved on to Valentine's Day with this offering. Even though it is essentially the same plot, this one offered up a different setting and more adult characters which would help a lot. Set in the small town of Valentine's Bluff, a mining accident kills a group of men while the town was celebrating a Valentine's Day dance and party. The lone survivor, named Harry Warden (Peter Cowper), warns the town to never have another valentine dance or party, or else. Jump ahead twenty years and guess what? The town is getting ready for a Valentine's Day dance. The Sheriff receives two heart shaped candy boxes with real hearts in them! The party's coordinator Mabel (Patricia Hamilton) is killed (In one of the movie's scariest scenes of serious stalk and slash) and her body is stuffed into a dryer until she is a crispy corpse. The Sheriff and town officials quickly cancel the party. This doesn't stop the group of hard working miners and their girlfriends of having a private party in the mine itself. The party is crashed by an angry killer wearing a gas mask and picks them off in gory fashion mostly by pick ax. It's refreshing to see adult characters instead of the idiot teenagers that usually fill these films. Somehow all of this is a little more believable. Even though they are killed off in the same manner, the film has a realistic feel to it. Add the fact that Director George Mihalka delivers solid suspense, an aggressive killer, some bloody and inventive kills; and My Bloody Valentine turns into everything a slasher film fan can ask for. The mine setting, with its underground tunnels has a closed in look that ads unexpected atmosphere. The killer has a memorable appearance in full miners gear making him one of the more intimidating killers from these types of films. The killer is particularly vicious and this movie has gory scenes that are memorable. Mihalka takes a simple scenario of a girl waiting for her boyfriend to come back with beer and milks it for solid scares which end in a wicked impalement of the girl on a shower head. They die by the numbers but it's the getting there is where the fun lies and this film delivers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horror is not my favorite but I like to press play on one once in awhile. This is much better than I expected. It's a Canadian film that really does justice to the slasher genre. FX were pretty good and the gore was great and not that cheesy. Made me smile to see it done well compared to how many really bad efforts there are out there. Except why is it so hard for me to ever get used to that Canadian accent, eh? Quentin Tarantino apparently calls this his favorite slasher film. I would highly recommend it to horror fans who appreciate this era in horror filmmaking.--A Kat Pirate Screener</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite 80's slasher flicks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twenty years ago in the town of Valentine Bluffs, a group of miners were trapped underground due to the negligence of two supervisors who were in a hurry to get to a Valentine's Day party. The only survivor was Harry Warden, who killed the others and resorted to cannibalism in order to survive. He was declared legally insane and sent to an institution but escaped a year later on Valentine's Day. Donning a mining suit and gear, he murdered the two supervisors responsible for his confinement, placing their hearts in candy boxes. He warned the town to never have another Valentine's Day celebration or he would come back to exact his vengeance once again. He was taken back into custody and was never heard from for the next twenty years. Cut to present day February 12, 1981 and the town has decided to ignore Harry Warden's threats from two decades ago and have a celebration anyway. Meanwhile, someone wearing a mining suit has begun killing off locals one by one with a pick axe and placing their hearts in candy boxes. Has Harry Warden returned to finish what he started? This has always been one of my favorite slasher movies from the glorious 80's and one of the things that sets it apart from the others is the in depth characterization of the leads. The love triangle between TJ (Paul Kelman), Axel (Neil Affleck), and Sarah (Lori Hallier) was done very well and made for an engaging watch. All the players here were very believable although of course there were a few groan inducing characters like the token fat guy who is still dressed by his mother and the typical annoying prankster, which were common elements at the time. But it's no doubt that the best thing about this film is the killer himself. A miner with a pick axe who breathes heavily and shines his light into his victims eyes before offing them is a fantastic idea for a slasher villain. And the compelling backstory he was given is intriguing as well. I also love the claustrophobic setting of the rustic mining town and the final act which takes place underground, making for some very suspenseful and creepy moments. This film has some great gore too. Unfortunately most of it was cut by the MPAA but luckily it was restored in the special edition DVD. There is a twist at the end which doesn't make much sense at all and rewatching the movie doesn't make it seem anymore believable. I won't give it away but you'll see what I mean when you watch it. All in all, this is a terrific slasher film that is definitely worth checking out for any horror fan. The 2009 version was really good too, definitely one of the better remakes I've seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Skip the Remake!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Way back in '81, the original movie came following Friday the 13th. And while watching it, you can clearly see where this film got many of its influences. Sadly, it remained largely unknown... Then in the mid-2000's, Hollywood came along and decided to remake it. Trying to capitalize on 3D, and featuring one of the most notable nude scenes in recent years, it attempted to pump new life into this franchise. My advice: Skip the remake!!! Go back to the original and see what it's got going for it. The story: Years back, there was an accident at a mine. Seven miners were trapped underground. Only one came out, Harry Warden, driven crazy from the isolation. Blaming the owners of the mine, he flipped out on Valentine's Day and killed some folks. He was captured and put into an asylum. Flash forward, I believe, 20 years, and the town has finally decided to have a Valentine's Day dance again. Know what happens? Bodies start piling up! What sets this one apart from the other early slasher flicks is the attention to character. While the first bloody deaths take some time to happen, the filmmakers focus on a cast of miners and their girlfriends. At the center, Sarah is torn between TJ (her boyfriend who left for the west coast) and Axel (TJ's best friend and her current squeeze.) After failing out there, TJ's returned and hopes to pick things up with Sarah once more. But Axel isn't too happy about that. The other characters are equally strong. But once the bloody deaths and scares come along, it's all worth it! And trust me, you won't figure out who the killer is until the very end! So hunt this one down for a great early slasher flick!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Plot, Forced Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie began like almost all slasher flicks; there's a legend about the town, a love triangle, and the first of many murders. At first I began to think that the man that was depicted in the legend, Harry Warden, had come back to exact his revenge as he said he would if the town celebrated Valentine's Day with any parties or dances. The town sheriff and the Mayor thought the same thing. As the story continues and the body count climbs I began to think the killer is someone from the town that took the persona of Harry Warden to drive fear into the townspeople, but it wasn't who I thought. The love triangle comes into play towards the end when the killer is unmasked and it turns out to be one of the two men in the triangle. Good plot, telegraphed though. Acting was OK, for something that is nearly 35 years old. I'll have to see if the remake made in 2009 was better. On a scale of 1 to 10, on IMDb.com, I give this a 7, the plot saved this one for me. Also this is the first time I have seen this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Bloody Valentine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine is definitely in the top 5 list of 1980's slasher films. It uses location, atmosphere and gore in all the right ways making this one a Canadian classic. The story is that twenty years prior on Valentine's Day, a group of miners were trapped down below thanks to two of the workers not doing their jobs properly. They were rushing to get to the Valentine's Dance. After days of digging to rescue them, Harry Warden was the only survivor and he survived by eating the other men. Fast forward to 1981. The small mining town is planning their first Valentine's Day party since that awful night. But the police chief and mayor soon get bloody warnings from "Harry" telling them to cancel the celebration or there will be bloodshed... unfortunately for them, a group of the town's youngsters are having a party at the mine with a killer closing in on them.I love this original 'My Bloody Valentine'. I saw it when I was younger, and it scared the hell out of me. Parts of it still scare me to this day. The location shots underneath in the mine are perfect because of how dark and narrow it is down there. Some of the chase scenes are so creepy because of how hard it is to move around down there. The killer wears full mining gear (including a mask) and he carries around a huge pick ax. There is also a ton of gore in this one, and even more gore in the version not shown in theatres.The acting was actually pretty well done for an eighties slasher flick. The lead characters all did their jobs, and supporting cast (in particular Cynthia Dale) were good as well. The suspect list pretty much includes Harry Warden or the two lead male character's (Axel and TJ) who are vying for the love of Sarah. It keeps you guessing right until the shocking conclusion. Definitely check this film out if you are a fan of horror. It is one of the best made in that great era of scary slashers.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Bloody Love this Film!.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was pretty good! and you had some good blood and Gore, so Gore hounds will love this film,i personally don't care much about blood or gore i focus more on the story and the characters and this film had a pretty good story and most of the people were Like-able and they weren't annoying either!,i can't stand annoying Characters!. The film is about a guy in a minors outfit that goes around killing people one by one because he seems to have some kind of problem with Valentines Day and why is that? we don't know,we have to guess why he hates valentines day and that's what i liked about this film it kept me guessing all the way through,i really like stories like this the guess whodunit type of story where we have a bunch of suspects and we have to figure out which one is the killer.This is a pretty Fun movie and its very suspenseful and has a few creepy moments too and i thought the look of the killer was quite creepy!,a guy in a minors outfit and Gas mask over his face wielding a pick Axe! as a weapon how Bad-ass can you Get!. So i thought the killer looked cool and the Gas Mask was a great choice for the killer i thought it suited him well. People in this film start to receive bloody gifts and strange things start to happen.People get murdered one by one and everyone seemed to think Harry Warden was the killer because years back he murdered a bunch of people because he had been trapped in a mine and it had driven him insane! and he blamed everyone for what happened to him. But the question is, is Harry Warden really the killer? or does someone else have an Axe to pick with the people in Town?.you get some good kills in this film and some suspense and mystery and you also get a couple of police officers investigating trying to figure out what's going on and they get the kids to cancel the valentines Party after a murder took place because the killer sent them a warning note not to go to the Party but they ignore the police and go anyway because they wanted to party and have fun.If the police had of told them the reason why they couldn't have the party the teenagers would have listened and called it off but they didn't even know they were in danger so it was not entirely their fault how can it be when they don't know?. And of course the killer strikes at the party and people begin to disappear one by one and i found some of the kill scenes with the killer interesting and creepy the way he just pops out of nowhere! and then kills one of them!.It was kind of funny the way this guy always seemed to have his costume with him wherever he went and he was somehow able to put it on without anyone noticing and then sneak off,i thought that was kind of weird but who cares! this is a horror movie and horror films tend to be a little cheesy at times so that didn't bother me. The guy must have just been really fast and he must have had his minors outfit hidden somewhere so he could get it on whenever he chose to kill someone.All in all i thought this was a good movie,it was a little slow at the start but that didn't bother me much because i liked all of the characters in the movie and some of them i found Funny especially the chubby guy who was friends with the lead Girl. I thought the mine was a great idea for the setting and a great location for the killings to take place because people could easily get lost down there and then the killer could go after them,plus the darkness and claustrophobia in the mine makes it a little scary too so i thought the mine was a good and interesting idea and i thought the movie was well paced and i thought the acting was good from most of the people and this film definitely deserves a watch from everyone,i found it quite unique.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Review Of "My Bloody Valentine" 1981</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not wanting to be stereotypically me and go for Christmas and Halloween horror, which I tend to migrate toward, I have decided to review "My Bloody Valentine" 1981. One of those classic slasher flicks that I have seen many a time. The story follows the folklore around a mining accident in Valentine Bluffs. It happens on one of the holiday's that quite frankly since becoming an adult I do not seem to get into. (Neither does my BF so I am good on all counts with that!). "My Bloody Valentine" was directed by George Mihalka. Actually until the remake came out I thought most people just threw this film to the side or just forgot about it. It is a true classic horror story with the principle set ups, story line, and back story. A man left behind in an mine collapse goes insane, kills out of revenge, he becomes legend, and the legend comes to life. There are some truly gory moments in this 80's flick. From one victim crammed in a dryer and another being speared on a shower spout this film really makes an effort to get as gory as it's "Friday the 13th counterparts. This film began a long line of horror flicks around holidays most of which were cut and dry. Kids do something or go some where they are told not to, have a good time then get slaughtered. For me "My Bloody Valentine" got most of the stuff you want in a horror movie right. The story was classic and dark from the legend of Harry Warden to the defiant Valentine party at the mine. The acting is par for the coarse in early 80's horror films. The sound effects are minimal but eerie with only one real song worth mentioning "The Ballad Of Harry Warden".There is a lot of build up in this film with suspense and point-of-view angles as the killer spies on the town and sneaks up on the victims. There is plenty of blood and gore in the film that at times seems as graphic as you can get. Other times it seems cheap and plasticated. However there is nothing about any of the special effects in this film that did not work. Even the large human heart in the candy box looked gory enough to have an impact. This film has some things that make it annoying. It is a digitally remastered film but it seems to come from a bad master because the sound effects and over all quality is stressed and at times screechy. Much like the original "Friday The 13th" is. IT was a period in horror when high pitched tones (much like nails on a chalkboard) were standard in horror films. It isn't a film with a great soundtrack like Amityville Horror or Nightmare On Elm Street but then again this was before Horror was so embraced. It was just getting it's first big wind when these films came out. That aside "My Bloody Valentine" remains one of my favorite simply because the death scenes are gory and good, I like a cheesy story with minimal acting and it is from my favorite decade of horror films. Not my favorite holiday but this is one of my all time favorite films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine is a good film; however I was let down by the deaths. Yes, It is 1981 and Yes we now have CGI but they could of being slightly better. I honestly think the story line is terrific, brilliant in fact; however I found some of it quite funny. Tbh, I did actually enjoy the overall film and it was pretty spooky; however it generally could of being a little better; regardless it was made in 1981. If I look back there was only really 2 gruesome parts in the films and they was hardly moderate. It does have a psychological twist towards the end which seemingly, kind of put me off. However; if you like a good horror, have a go at watching this.</fullReview>

Initial rumours peristed the gore footage would be as a bonus feature - not spliced back into the film, HOWEVER, this it has been confirmed by Lionsgate that the movie will be released with the gore restored in its correct place. Lionsgate have done what Paramount should have done several times before. Slasher fans could do with a company like Lionsgate to get their hands on the Friday The 13th series so we can see those uncut too - but i'm dreaming of course - paramount will never sell the rights to those because it makes too much cash for them. So at last - MY BLOODY AVLENTINE TOTALLY UNCUT, REMASTERED AND RESTORED, IN WIDESCREEN! What more could a slasher fan ask for - don't hesitate - BUY THIS NOW!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't care I love it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film about 6 years ago which surprises me as I am late 30's and certainly remember going to the video shop in the mid to late 80's and renting out films that should have been too scary for me. I remember always wandering around the horror section and marvelling at the covers, The Thing being the one that I recall vividly even 25 years later. This must have been there and despite the relaxed attitude of the shop workers who didn't seem to care about your age, this is new to me comparatively. My love particularly of Halloween has drawn me to the supposed Slasher golden age and I have tried to watch a fair few, although there were so many that I still have a lot to get through. Most of course look like home movies nowadays, but this does stand out. I genuinely think it is a terrific example of this genre, as there is something genuinely unsettling and menacing about the miner. The light blinding you in the face beforehand is a great touch and the heavy breathing somehow induces a genuine fear in the audience. Much has been talked about the cuts, so no need for me to comment there but I particularly like the Harry Warden back story here. A lot of the Slashers failed to convey the motives coherently and yet here we are, fully aware of Harry Warden and why he did what he did. OK the end of course is what it is, but strangely I want to know about Harry and his time in the hospital, how he escaped etc - it leaves me wanting to know more and that makes it a success for this viewer. Some don't like the central love triangle but I didn't feel it takes up too much time to detract and I do love the town. It is February so everyone looks cold and the skies are grey which gives a sense that perhaps the sun hasn't shone here in a while. That acts well for atmosphere by emphasising that this is a working class small town desperately, though unsuccessfully, trying to move on from the tragic events that had happened 20 years ago. If you like your early 80's slashers, this is easily one of the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice underrated slasher from Canada.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A typical but well made slasher flick from very early in the sub-genre's life, My Bloody Valentine boasts a competent cast, flashy direction, and an interesting, if somewhat generic, storyline. Twenty years ago, several miners lost their lives due to the negligence of the townsfolk during the Valentine's Day dance. The lone survivor of the tragedy gets revenge on the town through bloody murder, and he warns the town never to celebrate the holiday again. Flash forward to the present day, 2 days before the first Valentine's Day dance in 20 years, and the killings resume. A pickax wielding killer in a gas mask, a nice dramatic love-triangle subplot, and creative and original kills place this one well above average for the slasher genre. Though the gore appears to be all but completely cut out (this is one film that would really benefit from a director's cut release), the film establishes great atmosphere and the use of the mine during the film's climax is a nice touch. My Bloody Valentine makes use of all the slasher clichés (except for nudity) and retreads several ideas from previous entries, but the production value and competent direction is enough to set this film apart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Call off the Valentine's Dance, you hosers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Southwestern Ontario, we've long had a saying: A well-topped hot dog is better than a naked hamburger. "My Bloody Valentine" would seem to disprove the cinematic equivalent of this statement.Even in its truncated form, "My Bloody Valentine" is a marvelous slasher film. It is moody without being slow-paced, authentic without being pretentious, and above all, Canadian without resorting to a lot of ham-fisted clichés (note the antiquated crates of Moosehead Lager). Think of it as "Goin' Down the Road" with extricated human hearts.It's curious that such a film could be cut by a full nine minutes (!) and maintain its coherence, let alone its effectiveness. While there's no denying that I'm keen to see an uncensored version of this semi-festive semi-classic, it doesn't feel like it's missing much in its present form. Frankly, the inclusion of nine minutes' worth of gore might just undermine the folksy, na?ve qualities that make the film so endearing. Granted, opening a clothes dryer and finding the scalded corpse of a local spinster might not strike everyone as "folksy and na?ve", but we slasher fans are cut from a rarefied cloth.Is this endeavour as effective as the other Canadian trail-blazing slasher film "Black Christmas", or as efficient as Carpenter's follow-up "Halloween"? No. It isn't nearly atmospheric or frightening enough to be included in such distinguished company. Nonetheless, there are enough jolts and spooks in "My Bloody Valentine" to put it far ahead of contemporary pretenders like the "Insert 1980s Slasher Title Here" Reboot.Paramount, please release an uncut version of this little film, and while you're at it, "Friday the 13th" parts 1 through 8. I'll be your best friend.</fullReview>

Valentine Bluff is also a mining town and most of the male population work in the mines. 5 miners are working on the night of the dance, and their 2 supervisors, anxious to get to the festivities, leave the miners without checking the levels of methane gas. An explosion ensues and the miners are trapped alive. The sole survivor, Harry Warden, is put in a mental hospital because of the trauma only to eventually escape and kill the supervisors responsible for the tragedy. He warns the town to never hold another Valentine's Day celebration, and disappears. 20 years later the town decides to move on and hold another dance, and a blood soaked heart-shaped box arrives at a town official's desk with a severed heart inside. Harry Warden's back!! The mayor cancels the dance and keeps why quiet, so a group of the town's kids organize a secret party at the mine, and one by one they fall prey to a faceless killer in a miner's uniform.I really enjoyed this movie and try to watch it every February. It doesn't really stand out from the slasher flicks of the early 80's too much, but it's enjoyable enough. Once again you have the necessary components (prankster guy, hero guy, blonde hot girl, sneaking away for some nookie with nasty results, etc), but the ending is worth it. Keeps you guessing right to the end. My favorite is the scene with the one girl and all the miner's uniforms dropping down; spooky. Well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine is good but the only bad thing is the crappy costume that the killer wears I mean a miners suit isn't scary because its like something out of the old 1960s doctor who episodes.it would be better if it had a creepy mask like the killers in all the other horror films use like Michael myers wears that scary white mask. Jason wears the hockey mask and leather face has that weird leather mask.also I heard that the MMPA banned around 13 minuets or something like that but any way how the hell can it be any worse than that because about 14 people die in this so who else could.Apart from that though themes up for me.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They didn't have a huge budget to work with on this one and they didn't need one. The story is great, The Psycho mine-worker who goes on a rampage to avenge those who were responsible for an accident.There's a few scenes of this movie that'll always stay with me. One of them being the scene where the bartender decides to play a prank on the kids and sets a little trap for them. It's even more interesting to see how it back-fires on him. A lot of the movie (at least by today's standards) is going to be somewhat predictable.That said, the scenes toward the end at the mine have some uniqueness to them. The plot twist at the end is one that not everyone would catch either. I like the song they sing in this too (Harriet) and the eerie poems left in heart-shaped boxes. Someone must really hate valentines day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cut Scenes May Break a Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"My Bloody Valentine" is a solid, well done slasher film with high production qualities, a decent script, careful directing, and some half-way decent acting. However when people go to see slasher films, especially from the early 80's, they aren't looking for those things... they are looking for the gore and nudity. Sadly for "My Bloody Valentine", the gore was pretty much completely cut by the MPAA in 1981, and the existing footage of the extended gore scenes might very well be lost. Of course, that it what this slasher is most known for, and you will most likely be seeing the film without much gore at all."My Bloody Valentine" truly succeeds in its small town atmosphere that is very similar to that John Carpenter created in "Halloween" or Sean S. Cunningham created in "Friday the 13th". The film has a certain nostalgic feeling to it, and it is relevant when watching that the sets are all authentic. The characters also help to add to the small town feeling. Lori Hallier shines as the 'final girl' of the film, and Neil Affleck and Paul Kelman also do a job well done as the two stars. Hallier, Affleck, and Kelman truly are the only ones who play characters that you get to know and care about, typical for a slasher. The subplot of the story has Affleck and Kelman fighting over Hallier, trying to win her affection on Valentine's day and not paying attention to the lurking danger. Believe it or not, but it was this subplot that made the movie all that more appealing - a little extra detail can never hurt.The main story surrounds the small town of Valentine's Bluff. A group of teens planning a Valentine's Day dance, which hasn't been held in twenty years due to grisly murders, are told by authorities that they can't hold it anymore after police received a Valentine box shaped like a heart with an actual human heart inside. The kids then decide that they would hold their party at the mines, where the cops can't find them - bad idea. There's a few shrieks and shrills waiting in "My Bloody Valentine", and overall it is about the equivalent to a "Friday the 13th" film. The ending is good, you may guess it, but still good, and what truly makes the film worth watching is the song that plays during the end credits.The DVD for "My Bloody Valentine" is anything but stellar. It is completely bare-bones, with no trailer, photo gallery, commentary, or featurette. This is kind of sad, considering that this film is one of the most famous slasher movies of all time and hasn't even been given a trailer. Since they've cut the gore, at least give us a special feature. - This review refers to the 2006 DVD edition of "My Bloody Valentine".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I just finished with the annual viewing of My Bloody valentine. First of a double feature.And the lingering question on everyone's mind remains. How did Howard die? Well the sequence of events isn't the question, it all makes sense. I just wonder how his body got to where it was. Anyway, just a couple of thoughts on the film. Didn't these people have homes? We only saw them at the mine, the bar or once a junk yard. Why were they cooking their dinner on the car engine? Couldn't they have had a party in their own homes? Since when did the police have control of that.Anyway, all in all an entertaining view. If you haven't seen it yet, well there's no better time than today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is actually a very good horror film. It is one of those rare films that actually takes horror seriously, rather than try to turn it into a comedy. There are very suspenseful moments and a few really good scares. It actually has a story behind it rather than just hack-n-slash paint by numbers. The characters are likable and believable. The mine was a great environment for a horror movie. It is too bad horror movies like this aren't made anymore. Instead we get garbage like Halloween Resurrection and Shredder. Anyone who is looking for a good horror movie can't really go wrong with this one. I highly recommend it. Unless you like a lot of cheese...in that case go rent Scream or some other ridiculous horror comedy. This one takes the horror genre seriously and is much better for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>yet another Paramount classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the late seventies and early eighties, Paramount Pictures began a streak of quality horror films paralleled only by the Universal Films of the thirties and forties. Exemplified by the Friday the 13th series, My Bloody Valentine, Silver Bullet, April Fools Day, Tourist Trap, and many others, these films, though headed by diverse directors, presented a singular atmospheric moodiness, attained through a mandated set of production techniques. As a result Paramount was able to consistently release films that seemed vaguely familiar in a comforting way, yet dealt with a wide variety of unique subject matters within the expansive slasher genre.My Bloody Valentine is an exploration of the environment and lives of modern day miners, an idea rarely touched by the horror genre. The easygoing feel of the town (almost stephen king-esque) is rocked by a holiday slasher, climaxing with an exciting chase through the mineshaft with few survivors. Superb acting by a well-selected cast, whose characters are given a chance to develop is the highlight of this top rate horror gem. A movie so good that one of the best bands ever borrowed their name from the title! See it now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good slasher flick! A miner traumatized as a child by his father's murder, goes on a killing spree before the Valentines Day dance. On the same level as Halloween &amp; Friday the 13th. Gore galore with killer masked up as coal miner. Set up for a sequel but one was never made.Too bad. The acting could have been a little better but still a grabber. Not the usual amount of T &amp; A you would see with other slashers but makes up for it with graphic murder scenes. The killer's identity is not known till the final scenes. The killer's costume is one of the best in any horror movie. The mine itself is dark and creepy and it even has a creepy bartender. Come on Sarah, be my Bloody Valentine.</fullReview>

Not too bloody and almost totally without nudes (at least in the rated version that I've seen on VHS), the movie is not really bad, anyway: a couple of the deaths are well done, there is a very unusual scenario in which to take the action and even the debatable finale is not totally unconvincing. Perhaps too loved by many of the horror writers in the field, but watchable indeed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~My Bloody Valentine is the ultimate Friday the 13th clone. Here's why: it takes place on a holiday/famous date, a killer is on the loose taking revenge for someone who was wronged in the past, it's from Paramount studios, and there's even a Crazy Ralph character. Geez, it even takes place on the day after Friday the 13th because the Valentine's Day party is on a Saturday. The sad part is it could have been a good slasher flick if I could've looked past the unoriginality. Despite that, and the fact that Paramount cut out all of the gore, this little slasher still somewhat holds up. It has a couple of good kills and a few good scares but loses any pizazz it might have had due to the lack of gore. I can't give it a bad review though because it is almost an exact replica of Friday the 13th. Instead of a boy drowning, a miner is buried alive. That's the extent of the differences between the two films. Well, that, and it was filmed in Canada. Although it's a complete rip-off, My Bloody Valentine is still a step up on the usual slasher scale. Be sure and listen to the hilarious theme song that plays over the credits."Welcome to Valentine Bluffs-the little town with the big heart."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If nothing else, the ballad of "The Legend of Valentine's Day" over the end credits lifts this flick into the slasher Hall of Flame.It has been described as a diamond in the rough and that is a fair analogy. For some reason I can't quite put my finger on, I retain a deep liking and respect for this film. Something about it is vaguely mesmerising. Its not the story - Harry Warden, miner turned psycho twenty years earlier when six other miners died in a pit explosion on Valentine's Day starts up his own little slash-fest. Its not the actors - something less exactly than household names. It sure as hell isn't the scintillating script or the million dollar effects. Yet the film rises somehow way above the sum of its parts The tiny remote Canadian Township exerts some sort of intrigue as do the Anglo-Irish-Canadian accents. Certainly the mineshaft settings are both claustrophobic and eerie, in fact the level of cinematography is above average for this type of film.Made to cash-in on the success of both HALLOWEEN and FRIDAY THE 13TH, the film was not particularly well patronised upon its release but has since become a minor cult flick with the passage of years.Just the film for a late night scare mid winter with a roaring fire and the lights off. Whatever you do, hang out for the ballad at the end. It is the highlight of the film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Absolute Favorite Slasher Movie of All Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since it follows in the footsteps of Halloween (the trend setter for all 80s slasher movies), My Bloody Valentine is an often overlooked diamond in the rough. Although my viewpoint is biased because of my adoration for the slasher genre, it also suggests that I have seen scores of films that follow the same format as My Bloody Valentine (killer preys upon hapless teenagers one at a time until the ultimate showdown, where the killer is unveiled and HOPEFULLY! his/her motives are made clear.) Well, My Bloody Valentine is all of that and so much more. First, let's start with the setting. A sleepy little Canadian town where most of the folks make their livings at the local mine. The mine makes for a creepy and claustrophobic atmosphere for the killer to do most of its stalking, shish kebabbing, and nail gunning. The killer itself(don't want to give away anything here) is imposing and downright scary in its miner's outfit, complete with gasmask and pickaxe. Then there is the mystery of the killer. Who is it? Is it the legendary killer, Harry Warden, from 20 years ago, or is it someone else using Harry's old M.O.? Because both the setting and the killer are A-1, the only things left that I consider key elements to making a great horrormovie are score and cast. The score of My Bloody Valentine is sufficient. It is not as memorable as those of Halloween or Friday the 13th, but it does a great job setting the background for the story. Last is the cast. People may ask, what difference does the cast make in making a slasher movie? A lot! No big name actors = a more believable story. Since this movie doesn't star Busta Rhymes(ugh) or Freddie Prinze, Jr.(no thanks) the characters seem to be more real, thus adding the suspense to the picture. There are no big name actors in this movie, unless you consider the guy who played Larry Finkelstein in Meatballs to be a big name actor. While we are on the subject of acting, there definitely isn't anything Oscar-worthy in this picture, however, that also helps to make this a true classic of the 80s slasher genre. Some people might say I didn't mention anything about body count/gore to be important for slasher films. Well, I don't think that they are as important as the aforementioned key elements, because it is the creepy atmosphere that sells horror, and this movie in particular. However, to be a true slasher movie, you need at least a couple of deaths. Hey, I still want to see a body count too! Oh by the way, this movie has plenty of cool death scenes, so everyone should be satisfied. "Roses are Red, Violets are Blue, My Bloody Valentine is waiting for you" Check it out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Bloody Slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS AHEAD...Another Slasher film from the early eighties, but thankfully with the new claustrophobic setting of a small, bleak mining community this one packs extra atmosphere and a genuine sense of creepiness.When the mentioned town decide to have their first Valentine dance in twenty years a killer in overalls and mining mask, blinding torch attached to his helmet appears and stalks the streets with a pickaxe. After killing his prey he places their hearts in gift boxes and sends them to potential victims. Apparently the killer is the only survivor of a mining accident that could've been avoided if the town's folk weren't overindulging in the Valentine's dance at the time. Eventually we discover that the killer is not the aforementioned survivor but the disturbed son of one of the first victims.A lot of time is given to characterisation in My Bloody Valentine, but the majority of the cast are too inept to deal with the material. It is unusual not to have the slasher film set in academia, but this doesn't prevent the characters from drinking, having sex and doing drugs, hence setting themselves up for the killer. Unfortunately the full uncut version of this film remains quite a difficult find.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The missing link between the '80s slasher genre and British shoegazer pop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(*** out of *****) The people living in the mining town of Valentine Bluff, Nova Scotia have gone twenty years without celebrating Valentine's Day because of an incident in the mines that caused three men to be buried alive. Only one man was rescued several days later (raving mad and feeding off of his dead pals), and he took bloody revenge with a pickax on those he felt were responsible for the disaster. Flashforward to the present -- the town folk have finally decided to put the past behind them and throw a big party on February 14. But, no sooner are the paper hearts and streamers cut out and stuck all over the walls and ceilings of the bars (and Laundromats) than threatening notes and human hearts in candy heart boxes start to appear and people start getting pickaxed and stuffed into dryers. This cool little Canadian slasher thriller with a surprise ending has developed a minor cult following over the years (in large part because it inspired the name of Kevin Shield's legendary British shoegazer band in the late '80s). Aside from the expected horror-movie cliches and some lame false scares, the acting is mostly good and the storyline is a bit more developed than in other films of its type. The action really gets going in the third act, with a group of young people being chased through mine shafts by the killer, who wears a spooky miner's mask and uniform. You can tell a lot of the violence was cut before release. It would be nice to see this one fully restored on DVD.HIGHLIGHT: I'm waiting for the uncut DVD to come out before I give any highlights (there's a hanging/decapitation scene in the mine shaft that looks like it might be pretty impressive if it were not so badly edited.) ***Note: Since I wrote this review, the DVD has come out for this movie, but, unfortunately, the frustrating folks at Paramount believe in quantity over quality and don't seem to understand the concept of rereleasing DVDs with any special features (other than the occasional trailer) or restoring previously cut or deleted scenes. My advice: Wait for a better DVD of this movie to be released by a more customer-friendly distribution company (although, sadly, this might never happen, since Paramount released this movie in the first place.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine is an excellent slasher film that is definetly one of the best slasher films that came out of the 80s, it even tops Friday the 13th. *some spoilers* It is about a killer coal miner, armed with a pickaxe, who terrorizes a party full of teenagers in the small town on Valentine's Day. After the coal miner disposes of a couple of teens at the party, the killer then targets 6 teenagers who go down into the coal mines to take a tour of it. Many people have been complaining about the cuts that were made to the film. Almost every single murder is cut for gore to avoid an X rating. I must say, some of the cuts are overdone, and they make a couple of the murders hard to tell what's happening. But there is still enough excess blood and gory hearts left on screen to satisfy mild gore hounds. People have exagerrated that there is no on-screen violence left. There is pickaxe action on-screen, as well as other on-screen murders with boiling water and nailguns. But yes, in some murders, the screen cuts away before any bloody damage is done, which is a shame. I WOULD love to see the unrated director's cut of My Bloody Valentine, and i know it will be released one day, you just gotta be patient people. Though it's cut, the murders and the film are still very effective and some scenes are extremely well done (when the killer plays with a victim by dropping mining suits on them, and when the killer smashes lights in the mine, breaking them) and the story is well plotted. I highly recommend My Bloody Valentine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this as a double bill with the abysmal 'Valentine'. Avoid that one at all costs! This one though is the predecessor. Made in 1981 (A good year for independent slashers) it gets away with a good story, good atmosphere and plenty of gore! The story is that 5 miners went to work and were abandoned by 2 colleagues who snuck off to a valentines ball. The 5 miners weren't warned about the methane levels so they lit a match and the whole place collapsed. Rescue workers dug their way in to find a miner named Harry Warden crazy and he had to resort to cannibalism to stay alive. After the 2 colleagues are murdered by Warden he warns never to hold a valentines ball again. 20 years later they decide to hold a ball again. Oh oh! The movie delivers the killings from the start with ample amounts of blood and gore. The killings are very creative and some include a man having his face put in a boiling hot dog saucepan, a woman being put in a washing machine and a man getting nail gunned at the head! The plot and story is different and the killer is very scary and imposing wearing full mining gear including gas mask and pickaxe. All of the characters are rednecks, which ups the fun level! Some of the cast went on to do better things. Neil Affleck (Not related to Ben) went on to direct episodes of 'The Simpsons' and Keith Knight who played Hollis went on to be a voice artist. This and some good set pieces make this a very good example of 80's slasher. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had read alot about this movie on the internet so i decided that when it came out on dvd i would buy it, but this i would`nt recommend!This is a very average slasher-flick from the 80`s, but its probably one of the better ones. A couple of mineworkers are killed when the mine that they work in collapses. Now theres nobody around to save them because everybody else is at the valentines party thats in town. However one of the miners did not die and now he`s pretty p***ed off! So he kills a couple of people and valetine parties are pretty much banned from the town of valentines bluff. Until about 20-30 years later....I cant really remember how long it really was but is`nt it always 20 or 30 years later ?:) A valentines party is in the planning and someones p***ed off about it. So now theres a killer with a pickaxe and a gasmask slashing up the kids in valentines bluff (you just gotta love that gasmask!) This movie has everything you could expect from a slasher-flick ; the pretty girl,the heroic boy,the stupid fat guy,the (not so) funny guy,the old guy that warns everybody and alot of horny teenagers having sex in very odd places. This could have made for a pretty good movie, but sadly, paramount did a little slashing of their own. I dont thing the dvd release had even as much as a drop of blood in it! All of the death scenes were cut and this release could easily have a pg-13 rating. So if youre thinking of buying the dvd, dont! See if you can find the uncut version somewhere,because when your gonna watch a slasher-flick from the 80`s,you kinda expect a little gore. But still,it`s a good movie if like the horrorgenre as much as i do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somehow, between that mass production of countless forgotten slasher films of the 80's, a few gems were construed by our Canadian counterparts.My Bloody Valentine is a very atmospheric slasher film that will have you wondering ( a tad ) just who the hell it really is that possesses that huge pick axe! Is it TJ, a dark haired loner who left his girlfriend behind as he headed for bigger and better things, only to return to find out she's dating his best friend? Is it Axel, a disgruntled soul who's loosing his best friend and now the woman he loves? OR, is it Harry Warden, a man who died twenty years ago (Valentines Day) in a mine blast due to the neglegence of two foremen? A man who promised to kill and maim the town of Valentine Bluffs if they held anymore Valentine's Day dances?A very atmospheric, albeit claustrophobic little flick - a lot of the film being filmed within the tight corridors of a real Canadian coal mine. The little mining town makes way for a sleepy undertone, it's innocent silence being overshadowed by gruesome murders, even tho it's kept quiet by Sheriff Newby and the MAyor of the small mining town.This little whodunit works well on a late Saturday evening with the light out. The fun little love triangle is a fun watch that never gets tedious. Although heavily cut, a unique and very watchable (and rewatchable) film that will tickle your fancy just enough to like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1981 was certainly the year for gross-out flicks revolving around the calendar. MBV proved to be a more competent one at best. I like that fact that George Mihalka was able to infuse a relatively suspenseful plot to compensate for the gruesome killing. I also like the fact that it wasn't set in a summer camp (Friday the 13th) or a private school (Happy Birthday to Me) or that the victims were no older than 18 years of age. There were genuine moments that made me shudder and it made great use of the Canadian coalmines as well as the gear. The only disappointment I had was with the ending, though i won't reveal it, negates the reason why the cops were down there in the first place. overall though, it worked quite well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This lost slasher flick is very good. I own it, and every time I watch it I like it more then last time. The killers costume of a mining mask and mining clothes is very different and one of the coolest costumes I have seen on a killer in these type of movies. The only thing that wasnt good about this film was that every death scnene was incredibly cut. I herd an uncut version of this is saposadly very bloody. Setting aside from that this is a great movie and is one of the best in the genre. My secound favorite slasher so far being right behind THE BURNING! which is another good one. My Bloody Valentine gets the **** star rating in these type of films by my view.***TINY SPOILER***BEWARE OF HARRY WARDEN!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The small mining town of Valentine Bluffs is commemorating its title holiday despite the 20th anniversary of a careless disaster in the tunnels. Legend has it, that the one survivor will come back to avenge those who will celebrate on that day. The psychopathic partypooper is a pickax-wielding zeitgeist who likes to cut out the hearts of his unsuspecting victims and send them in heart shaped boxes to more unsuspecting dummies as a token novelty. How thoughtful. What is not so novel is this movie. Released by Paramount, this Canadian made junk is a very obvious miner for the cash that FRIDAY THE 13TH(also from Paramount) found. Problem is, a slasher pic banks on its stylish and numerous depictions of gore and dismemberments. MY BLOODY VALENTINE was severely trimmed down by the studio to receive an R rating. And if you know that, then you know this movie trimmed of its gore is about as bankable as porkchops in Israel. The film stars Paul Kelman(who?), Lori Hallier(who?)and Neil Afflek(any relation to Ben?) as the main characters in a love triangle. They along with their friends, decide to get drunk and venture into the mines. Even before 1998's SCREAM, it has become a pasttime to spot how many times characters curse themselves. In this movie, one guy tells the others,"I will be back in 10 minutes, I want to show her the main shaft." Yeah,go figure. They also heed against such innuendo as a sign in the mine that reads "Safety First!" You know you're watching a B-movie when they cast B-movie vet lookalikes. I thought I saw Christopher George, Stockard Channing and Bruno Kirby in the cast. They weren't. Hey,but if nothing else,you get a nice little intriguing whodunit, right? I guess. But alot of viewers said they figured out who did it. Ok,well at least you get an ironic ending right? Yeah,right. The only irony is that the killer in a hockey mask is from a movie made by Americans and not by these north of the border hacks. For whatever its worth; Eat your heart out,Canada.</fullReview>

As February 14 approaches someone sporting a coalminer outfit is on the prowl. Not as gory as you'd expect (most of the murders take place offscreen), but it's pretty slow and unpleasant.

		<fullReview>As far as mid-eighties slasher movies go, this one is pretty okay. The killer is cool looking, and there are a lot of kills, but they seem really cut down. You can always tell when a horror movie's had stuff cut out because most of the movie seems to have been made by rational people, but whenever you get to a killing scene it's like the editor had a stroke or something and everything goes in the toilet. One thing I really liked about this movie was that the funny fat guy has a gorgeous girlfriend. I also liked how they killed old people and young people, unlike most of today's slasher movies. Parts of this were later ripped off by "Valentine" and "Urban Legends: Final Cut".That's pretty much all I have to say about this movie. It's okay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but not enough to really stand out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This slasher film is too much like all the others that were cranked out around the early eighties. The acting is typically wretched, the dialogue is weak, the characters aren't terribly likeable, the cops are oblivious to the obvious, etc. So why didn't I hate this movie? It has some good possibilities for suspense (it takes place in a dark, creepy mine, and the killer is dressed in a mining costume with a pick axe, and you hear his breath in the air hose ala Darth Vader) but rarely cashes in on them. A few good scenes make it worth the rental, like the old woman in the dryer (hee hee!) and the curious meat product in the boiling pot with the hot dogs, along with the body in the fridge. And of course, when the killer smashes the lights in the mine as he chases his victims. But the potential for *real* suspense is mostly ignored.. oh well, hopefully it will be restored on DVD so its cut scenes (which kept it from being rated X) will make it closer to the great film it could have been. Worth renting, definitely!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite chilling. A restored and uncut re-issue would be nice!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A useful companion to fellow-Canadian slasher film, "Black Christmas", "My Bloody Valentine" borrows a little from "Friday The 13th" in terms of historical events determining plot and moulds itself into an effective and suspense-driven movie.Unfortunately the only version available over on this side of the world is the pre-Video Recordings Act butchered US version (released 1982) which contains a few trims. (There's a little bit of gore absent and it shows!). In addition when a videocassette is nineteen years old the tracking tends to suffer...Although you'll probably guess the killer's identity before the denouement, "My Bloody Valentine" satisfies nonetheless with its low-budget charm and largely unknown cast contributing to quite a chilling atmosphere.A fully restored and uncut VHS re-release would be most welcome however.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Little seen Canadian slasher pic that was obviously no Oscar contender. In the homely little town of Valentine's Bluff, the local teenagers (note - a majority of the cast appear to be closer to thirty) are preparing for the annual St. Valentine's Day dance, an event which was brought to a halt years earlier, where a demented miner, who happened to survive a cave-in due to carelessness, butchers the two responsible for the accident. He sends out heart-shaped candy boxes, stuffed with human hearts, as a warning not to hold another dance ever. Of course, predictably, the dance is cancelled, must to the teenagers disgust. Of course, predictably, they ignore the dire warnings and throw themselves a party, only to meet their grisly deaths. The conclusion, taking place in a mine shaft, reveals our culprit, only to leave way for a sequel - something which never occurred! If you're a fan of the teleseries, La Femme Nikita, you'll spot Don Francks in the cast line up, as Chief Newby. Also, Carl Marotte, who went onto better productions, has a minor role as one of the teenagers - At least he was the right age!</fullReview>

My Bloody Valentine is true horror at it's very best. alot of suspense as well as a few good scares. and what a great twist ending to. i give My Bloody Valentine 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen many slasher movies from early 80's and I must say that this one is decent. It's definitely not as good as for example "Burning","Nightmare" or "Just Before Dawn" but better than "Slaughter High" and some others. The cinematography is nice, the killer is creepy and the ending is quite surprising and features actual suspense. Sadly, for gore hounds the originally gory film has been edited by American censors post-Canadian distribution after being denied an "R". It's quite obvious because some of the murders seem to lack something. So if you are a fan of this sub-genre you can try this stuff.</fullReview>

Sure all these movies are low on plot and every one of them have their share of horny teenagers played be terrible actors, but isn't that what makes a slasher movie a slasher movie. In this one a coal miner pick axes his way through a small town due to a catastrophe 20 years ago. Some pretty scary scenes, though lots of the more graphic kills have been heavily cut making it look almost like My Bloodless Valentine.

		<fullReview>One of the best slasher movies ever made. The story is wonderful, the acting fantastic and the cinematography spectacular. Twenty years ago, a tragic accident in the Hanniger mine on St. Valentine's Day took the lives of five miners. The disaster occurred while the supervisors left their posts to attend the town's annual Valentine's Day dance. The only survivor, Harry Warden, was confined to a mental institution after the ordeal. On the disaster's first anniversary, he returned to the town for bloody revenge. He leaves a message in blood saying to never hold another Valentine's Day dance again. That was nineteen years ago, and memories have dimmed. A Valentine's Day dance is scheduled after 20 years, and the towns people couldn't be more excited. Soon, a blood soaked heart and a message saying to stop the dance appears. Before the night is over, terror will strike, again, and again, and again...Simply in my top ten list of the best horror films ever made. The body count is fantastic and quite creative. The final scenes in the mine are some of the creepiest scenes ever filmed, and will leave you breathless. Try not to come to a conclusion about the ending, because the clever twist ending goes over the top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unoriginal old school slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From George Mihalka, the man who brought you Eternal Evil (The Blue Man)(1985).Twenty years ago, in a small town, a Valentines dance was held in the towns hall. While everyone were happily enjoying the night, seven miners were working. Two of the miners left without telling the others, to attend the dance. This led the accident in which the mines collapsed on the men, killing them. But one of them - Harry Warden survived on the others meat. He was crazy when they put him in a mental hospital. A year later, he escaped on Valentines day &amp; came back to town to murder the two men. Since, there has never been another Valentines dance until now. Now, a crowd of young adults are setting up the dance. But as a box of Valentines containing a warning &amp; a blood-soaked heart arrives, locals are murdered...is Harry Warden back?The plot is an unoriginal mix of Halloween (1978) &amp; Friday the 13th (1979). Not good.However, this show, while not beating Halloween, is better than Friday the 13th. My Bloody Valentine (1980) did not put me in suspense &amp; it did not scare me. But i still like the movie. It is tense, well acted, has an OK score (some of it was from Prom Night (1979)) &amp; it has some strong death scenes.Another thing about this flick is that it looks real good &amp; better than most slashers from that error. The villain is scary, the atmosphere is scary &amp; there's just something about My Bloody Valentine that gets me. It's also a perfect example of the late 70's early 80's slasher films. It has the plot, horror, clichés, gore, the masked killer, the teens who look veerry old, the sex, the climax/twist. It does not have any nudity but i'll pass on that. PS: There is a little character development going on too.I don't see why everyone wants an uncut version. I know it will be nice but the picture is already gory as it is. We get some effective death scenes (half are offscreen) &amp; some good violence. Good enough. Cool weapon of choice, too.All in all i give it 3 out of 5 stars. I you want a perfect example of a slasher movie, than if you see this, you've seen them all. Kinda hard to find, but.</fullReview>

MY BLOODY VALENTINE is a film I have wanted to see for so long, but was never able to find a copy of, thanks to the release of the 3D remake hitting theaters, MY BLOODY VALENTINE arrived on DVD, UNCUT! along with it's original R-RATED release that you can viewed separately on the same disc (but who needs that?) &amp; was the film worth the wait? definitely! Now to be truthful, MY BLOODY VALENTINE will never win any awards for being exactly original in terms of story, since it rips off PROM NIGHT (1980) Friday THE 13TH &amp; HALLOWEEN &amp; even at times echo's another film made the same year THE PROWLER, with the killer returning to a small town many years after murdering people &amp; then disappearing only to resume his bloody ways when a dance is announced. The gore (especially in the UNRATED version) is plentiful, the acting decent &amp; the direction well handled, the story is also interesting despite being done to the death &amp; the atmosphere around the town &amp; in the tunnels, adds up to a fun horror item that no horror fan should ignore. Plenty of suspense &amp; creative kills in the vein of the Friday/Halloween series is also a big plus, the film only falters with it's creepy, though at the same time dumb conclusion. Remade under the same name &amp; filmed in 3D in 2009.*** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An 80's horror masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>20 years ago on Valentine's Day in a sleepy town, a tragic accident occurred at a local mining facility as a survivor named Harry Warren starts hating the holiday as he killed people on that day. Now he has returned back to town as the town has their first Valentine's Day party in 20 years since the horrific occurrences, he wears a mine worker's uniform with Pickaxe in his hand as he uses it for a weapon. He prepares to kill again for a group of young adults throw a party but they won't know what will kill them.An outstanding and underrated slasher flick from Canada has became one of those cult movies embraced by slasher and horror fanatics including Quentin Tarantino that declares the film his favorite slasher movie of all time. The film co-stars Don Franckes ("Heavy Metal" and "Rock &amp; Rule") as Sheriff Chief Jake Newby and Neil Affeleck, the gore effects are very effective and well done even for it's time. It's a gory and violent slasher epic with decent acting, a good soundtrack and of course fine kills but it nearly got an X rating for it's graphic violence which was toned down to get an "R" rating but now it's released back on DVD with the uncut version now on DVD for the first time just in time for it's excellent 3D remake which is awesome by the way. The film is highly influenced by the likes of "Halloween" and "Friday The 13th" but what works for this one is that it's a non-franchisable horror movie unlike those two even those they were masterpieces.Highly recommended and check out the new movie, it rocks!

		<fullReview>Another event-themed horror film, this one doesn't take place on Halloween or Christmas, but, obviously, Valentines Day. An interesting idea, (later visited in the film "Valentine"), which also has the unusual setting of a small mining town. Being an 80's horror film there is the usual stable of horny teens ready to be whacked off one by one, in this case, a maniac miner who survived a mine-collapse some years earlier on Valentines Day and went on to slaughter the people responsible. However, this time, the miner may not be who they think he is....The film has average acting, but Paul Kelman as T.J and Lori Haller are particularly good, and watch for a pre-fame Helene Udy as one of their friends. Some interesting death scenes, and the actors all seem to be having a good time which is nice to see. It may only be a minor blip in the history of horror, but it is worth watching for a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous........ and I'm a fan of slashers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a formulaic slasher film, playing on the premise of a local legend of a homicidal minor. He was trapped with a few others, and had to feast on their remains to survive. He blames the townsfolk, and more specifically their Valentines Day dance. It seems it played a part in delaying his rescue from the cave-in. The lead miners who should have rescued Harry Warden, skipped work early to attend a Valentines Day dance. After a year in a mental institution, he went after those lead miners, and cut their hearts out. Leaving the warning that it would happen to all those who dared hold a Valentine's celebration ever again. Well, think our cast of characters, a young group of college age vixens and horn-dogs, enough time has passed and they just "want to get laid". And where better to hold a Valentines party, but in the very mine that Harry is said to haunt. Some implausible bits here; why would anyone in their right mind go into a mine where not only has their been a catastrophic cave in, but also is the supposed haunt of a real life killer, not some imagined "boogey man". If you read about Jeffery Dahmer's exploits, and then realized he had never been caught, would you then go to a place he was known to have operated, and allegedly still lived? If you would, you're just as retarded as the characters in this film. Plus, why risk the claustrophobic confines of the mine? And what makes one think sex in a mine is a turn on? Which brings me to another gripe, the intro of the film, while entertaining, is leaves one unsatisfied, and realizing it's just a cheap cop out. A girl is led into the mine, and I mean deep into the mine, by someone she believes is her lover. Why? Cause she's amorous, and wants her man to take her in a dangerous place. Not really seeing the believability in this. Why would you let someone garbed in a miners' outfit lead you into the mine, unless you saw them putting the miners' gear on. And after that, why go into a isolated mine shaft to make whoopee? The town must have at least one motel, dorm room, bedroom etc. Just silly. Finally, when the deaths start occurring, and the characters realize there's a killer in their midst, why don't they do the logical thing and abandon the mine, in search of help? Why bother looking for your friends that are missing? Isn't it better to go get the cops, and some I don't know, weaponry to thwart the killer? I know slashers follow a basic formula, but do we really have to see another film with the red herring noises, and dummies that go "Is anyone there?" and then going further into a precarious situation to investigate.??? This is just a cheap Canadian cash in on the slasher revenues to be had in the early 1980's. Yuck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"My Bloody Valentine" was Canada's answer to the success of "Friday the 13th" and "Halloween II," and as the old cliche goes: Imitation is often the best form of flattery. In the small mining town of Valentine Bluffs, things haven't been the same since a freak mining accident claimed the lives of several men years before while the security was at the Annual Valentine's Day Dance. With a warning from one of the sole survivors of the accident NEVER to hold the dance again, a group of locals decide to hold the dance 20 years after the accident. Well needless to say (it is a slasher movie after all) on the eve of the Valentine's dance, people begin to be murdered by a killer disguised in a mining uniform and armed with a pick axe. Sometimes downright creepy, other times very soap-opera-ish, "My Bloody Valentine" tries to develop it's main characters and make the audience sympathetic to them before it sends them off to be butchered. A good thing to try to attempt in this genre, but I think this film goes about it the wrong way, resulting in many boring and drug-out scenes between the heroine and her two love interests. The acting is above average, and once the real action starts toward the end of the film, it transcends into a highly energetic and creative film. The menacing darkness of the mine itself provide the ideal creepy and clausterphobic setting for a film of this type. It is a refreshing change from the camp/wood, slumber party, college campus setting that was seen in practically every other slasher picture of this time period, though many may find its pacing less desirable. But overall, a well-crafted, well directing little picture that deserves the brief 80's cult following that it received. a 7.5 out of 10...a must for any true horror fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Canadian Sub-Product of Tobe Hooper 1974 `The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twenty years ago, on the Valentine's Day in the city of Valentine Buffs, seven miners are working in the Hanniger mine, while the locals are participating in a big party. The two supervisors, anxious for going to the party, leave the five workers in the mine, which is full of methane. There is an explosion, and some days later, only one survivor is withdrawn from the debris. The man is completely insane, killing both supervisors and cursing the town. The locals grieve the Valentine's Day and decide to have no more celebrations on this date in the city. In the present days, the next generation of dwellers decides to have a party again. Then, violent deaths happen, with the killer removing the heart of the victims. This movie is a sort of Canadian sub-product of 1974 `The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'. After the huge success of Tobe Hooper's flick, slasher movies became very common in the 80's. In this decade, at least 1978 `Halloween', 1980 `Friday 13th' and 1984 `Nightmare on Elm Street' and their sequences were very successful movies. 1981 `My Bloody Valentine' is another sub product of this violent genre, and does not present anything special or different from the previously mentioned flicks. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): `Dia dos Namorados Macabro' (`Macabre Valentine's Day')</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just when I thought my search for a movie at my local video store was over a woman told me about this film and the Hills Have Eyes. Guess which one was better, not this one that's for sure. The film is typical mid eighties teen fodder with actors who in my opinion act like robots programmed to act like drunk fools. These people work in a mine , what teen would work at a mine? The story is simple a angry miner gets revenge on his home town after his supervisors leave to go to a dance and forget to check the methane levels. By the end of this move you start thinking what am I doing watching this besides killing my brain cells and you don't even care about the characters. My suggestion , rent a film like the Ring if you truly need to scream because like the tape in that movie is just like this one ... it kills you slowly.DON'T RENT THIS!!!!!!!! _______________ __________________</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average slasher. For die hard horror buffs only.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently a lot of horror buffs think highly of 'My Bloody Valentine', but apart from the fact one of my favourite bands took their name from it I just can't see it being all that special. I admit I'm not the biggest slasher fan in the world. In my opinion if you've seen 'Black Christmas', 'Halloween' and 'The Burning' you've pretty much seen the best in the genre. The word is that a lot of gore was edited from 'My Bloody Valentine' before release, and while that has probably detracted from the movie somewhat, if all a horror movie has to offer is gore then to me it's pretty poor. Having a bunch of Canadian young people as the main characters (they actually look pretty damn old to me!) instead of your usual sexed up American teens makes it a bit more interesting, as does the mine setting, but look, this is very average fair, nothing more. I've seen dozens of worse horror movies than this, but I've also seen dozens of better ones, and unless you're a complete horror nut I can't honestly recommend this movie. Instead if you want superior early 80s horror try 'Dead And Buried', 'Basket Case' and 'The Evil Dead'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Bloody Valentine - uncut!!! Wow I can't believe I just wrote that...Finally!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And so finally the slasher 'Holy Grail' has been re-discovered and after twenty-eight years of patience, we can finally see the almost-complete version of this hugely popular early-eighties slasher.Notorious for being the film most tortured by censors upon its initial release, My Bloody Valentine has become something of a cult classic with a large number of fans. Even the most lukewarm horror enthusiast must admit to being slightly excited by the prospect of witnessing all the notorious gore that has, up until now, only been seen in a set of studio stills. The previously available print was missing over 9 minutes of footage, which thankfully producer John Dunning has now located. The on-line campaign to get the full uncut copy restored and released was one of the largest of its kind and thanks to the efforts of the movie's legions of adoring fans, we now have a special edition disc with nearly all of the glorious splatter intact.A small mining town in Canada has become famous over the years after a maniacal ex-miner went on a killing spree in the early sixties. He was the only survivor from a fatal accident on Valentine's night that stole the lives of numerous workers and left him having to survive by feeding on the corpses of his colleagues. Harry Warden murdered the supervisors that he considered responsible for the tragedy and stuffed their hearts into candy boxes to remind the townsfolk that their incompetence should never be forgiven. Twenty years later and the town is preparing for its first Valentine's dance since the gruesome massacre, but it seems that it is not only the decorations and romantic spirit that has returned. As a mutilated heart is sent to the local Sheriff with a gruesome warning that there will be more murders, it seems apparent that Harry Warden has come back once again....My Bloody Valentine is certainly a fine example of all that gave the most popular eighties slashers a significant standing in the annals of horror cinema. It boasts a likable cast that make up for their lack of A-list dramatic credibility with a warmness and depth of character that although laughably cheesy, evokes sympathy from the audience. The love triangle between the three leads is an intriguing sub-plot and the script is strong enough to allow the characters to work their way into the hearts of viewers.It can also lay claim to arguably the best arsenal of marketable gimmicks ever to be included in a single splatter feature and if the authentic calendar date doesn't induce your interest, then it's impossible to resist the excellent guise for the maniacal killer and the creepy mine location. The gas mask adds an extra dimension to the killer's essential-clichéd heavy breath and the pickaxe makes for an exquisite tool for gory slaughter. You can almost visualise the director's smile upon witnessing for the first time the awesome sight of his bogeyman strolling through the dimly-lighted shaft and stalking his intended victims. In terms of slasher visualisations, it's pure poetry-in-motion and Mihalka understandably milks the possibilities.Mihalka is no John Carpenter, but he does an impressive job in building suspense and he creates one or two decent jolts. The cast are surprisingly good for complete amateurs and their above-average performances are a rare and welcomed bonus. It was a conscious decision from John Dunning, the producer, to use actors that boasted far more potential than they did impressive CVs, because he wanted to invest heavily in the special effects. Mihalka has said that people don't go to see a slasher movie to witness a 'name' actor. He is right in acknowledging the fact that the amount of money a producer would spend on such a performer just to see him get splattered on the wall is an entirely pointless exercise.You only need to take a brief look at my review list to see that I am an avid 'slasher-fanatic', but My Bloody Valentine has never been amongst my favourites. I often wondered how the movie could have even been considered to be better than the likes of Intruder, The Prowling or even Curtains, because to me it felt like I wasn't watching the vision that Mihalka had initially intended. Now, with most of the gore intact, the film feels 'complete' and in its entirety it is a completely different concept. Despite popular belief, there were many early slashers that were stylishly produced and genuinely strong entries to the horror catalogue. My Bloody Valentine is one such feature and its well-deserving of its legion of admirers.The gore effects are as decent as their reputation would lead you to believe and the movie credibly mixes approachable characters and mean-spirited mass-slaughter to create an excellent mix of moods. Unfortunately we are still missing Michael and Harriet's death scene, which was either a decision by Mihalka (perhaps it looked too fake?) or that particular footage was never recovered by Dunning. It doesn't really matter however, because finally we have a copy of My Bloody Valentine that has almost everything that was intended and Sylvia's remarkably grisly slaughter and the notorious 'pick-axe through the face' are visions that are an iconic part of the whole slasher cycle.If you are even a half-hearted fan of early eighties stalk and slash flicks then I urge you to part with your pennies for this excellent example of non-franchise slash with panache that sums up everything that was great about the early eighties domination. No collection is complete without this sitting on a shelf next to Joseph Zito's The Prowler and Mark Rosman's The House on Sorority Row. The Harry Warden legacy has finally come full circle.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst 80's Slasher By Far!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert!!! The Version I had didn't have any gore which took away my happiness of getting the film but even when I saw the gore on Youtube I was not impressed with the crappy looking gore. There was only one kill I found interesting and that was when the guy got it through the eye ball. The characters were unlikable! The script didn't make any sense at the very end. The movie was a complete drag! And I didn't care if any of them died. In my opinion I liked the remake a little bit better because it has a very interesting twist unlike this movie, you know what happened when Harry Warden was alive, and you got all the gore you could ever want. I just didn't like the 3-d because it really is an eyesore when you have to look into glasses to see. Overall I give it a 1 out of 10 for that brutal kill through the eyeball.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 1981 horror film stars Paul Kelman, Lori Hallier, Neil Affleck, Don Francks and Peter Cowper. The town of Valentine Bluffs is about to celebrate Valentine's Day, but is in for a nightmare when a killer repeats gruesome murders that happened 20 years prior. It began during the town's Valentine's dance and 5 mine workers were trapped underground after an accident. Harry Warden (Cowper) was the only survivor who eventually killed the ones responsible for the mishap and was committed after. Soon, The killer warns the town of not having a dance, but takes out the ones that ignore him. Is Harry continuing his killing spree or is it someone else? Kelman plays T.J., Hallier plays his ex-girlfriend, Sarah whom he still loves, Affleck plays her boyfriend, Axel and Francks plays Chief Newby. This isn't a bad slasher flick I recommend for fans of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sad Valentine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The small mining town of Valentine Bluffs, Nova Scotia is planning on holding a Valentine's day dance for the first time in 20 years, since at that time Harry Warden, sole surviving miner of an cave-in he blamed on negligent owners, killed those owners with a pick-ax, before being committed to an insane asylum, cursing the town if it dared hold any Valentine's day celebrations. When a new series of brutal murders breaks out, police and townspeople cancel the party, but a rogue group of miners decide to have one anyway, much to their later regret...Marginal film has some effective direction, especially the claustrophobic feel of the mines, and the look of the "killer miner" is memorable. Also good that adults are the focus here for a change, but film is really hurt by the revelation of the killer's identity, which seems to have been plucked out of the air at random, since it doesn't add up to what we witnessed before, making it illogical. Still, this does have a haunting final scene and folk song, which sums the film up nicely.Special Edition Lionsgate and Paramount DVD features the long censored gore effects cut from the original release, though it doesn't really improve the film, which was better off without it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...One is dead, and so are you.A nicely moody, well done slasher, "My Bloody Valentine" is finally everything that it can be, with its extended scenes of gruesome slaughter restored for DVD &amp; Blu-ray releases by Lionsgate. These scenes add punch to what is one of the better entries in the original slasher craze.The genesis for the project came from producers John Dunning and Andre Link, at the time running the Canadian production company Cinepix. They'd established their genre credentials producing and executive producing the movies "Rabid" and "The House by the Lake", and settled on Valentine's Day as their holiday of choice.The story concerns a small mining town named Valentine Bluffs, where an annual dance to celebrate the holiday is being resurrected after horrible murders accompanied the last one, 20 years previous. And, once again, it seems that the brutal psycho is back as people start getting killed again...In addition to the delicious graphic mayhem devised by The Burman Studio, there are other substantial assets to make MBV a treat for the slasher fan. For one thing, as others have pointed out, unlike other Canuck slashers, it makes no attempt to disguise its Canadian origins. The working class town atmosphere is effectively realized, and the mine setting (a few abandoned mine shafts of the real Sydney Mines were utilized) is inspired as it lends true creepiness to the climactic action.Much like the demented soldier from "The Prowler", the killer here is dressed head to foot in the appropriate gear and is one Hell of a nasty guy. The "final girl" in this case, Sarah, played by the pretty Lori Hallier, is nice enough, and strong &amp; capable enough in the finale, but is most certainly not virtuous, as she vacillates between the two main male characters who each want to claim her for their own. Paul Zaza's music is superb and the end credits folk theme "The Ballad of Harry Warden" is catchy and haunting. The acting is good for this sort of thing, with Don Francks standing out as the frustrated police chief and Alf Humphreys supplying obnoxious comedy relief as "that damn Howard Landers". Jack Van Evera is a total hoot as the resident "crazy old guy with a warning", Happy the bartender.Much credit goes to director George Mihalka and crew, who had to contend with problems such as a fiasco involving some unnecessary set alteration, and being ordered out of the mine early as the locals were afraid the lights the filmmakers were using might somehow cause an explosion. They proved themselves up to the challenge and have delivered a thoroughly entertaining movie that still holds up well over 30 years later. Highly recommended to any new slasher enthusiast, although they are well advised to see the extended cut which makes an already good movie even better.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How bloody sweet it is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite an opening that promises all to the contrary, "My Bloody Valentine" goes from a merely passable first-wave "Friday the 13th" rip-off (bankrolled by Paramount, even) to a downright enjoyable little slasher with some atmosphere and suspense to accompany the inventive kills. It definitely trounces empty-headed imitators like "The Prowler." Granted, the film begins with the already-patented formula: introduce a group of horny, drunken, obnoxious twentysomethings who reside in a small coal-mining town; have the local old coot who tends bar tell the tale of a cave-in years before, claiming all but one miner, who subsequently loses his mind, is committed, but breaks out and inflicts bloody havoc. Cut forward several decades, and the pickax-lugging miner seems to have returned for another round of mayhem, cutting out the hearts of his victims as a preview of the slaughter to come. While the first 20 minutes are spent getting to know our grating cast of characters, "Valentine" gradually adopts a (mostly) convincing, serious tone, and director George Mihalka stages some surprisingly good scare scenes (making great use of an underground mine for the film's final third); while the ending nudges toward a franchise that never materialized, "My Bloody Valentine" is still a solid, standalone slasher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stodgy Canadian slasher.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine is a serviceable but not brilliant piece of entertainment. Coming from the era before slashers became too jokey and over the top and being Canadian it takes itself seriously and concentrates on things such as suspense and mood. Not to say it completely works, the movie is still formulaic and pedestrian but it gets the job done in a low-key way. The main problem with My Bloody Valentine is that it combines two different concepts which don't gel too well- the titular valentine theme and the slasher in a mine idea. The whole valentine motif is kind of lame, only providing a holiday to set the movie on, probably just because most of the slashers from the era were centred on a certain holiday or occasion and most of the good ones had already been taken (Though to my knowledge there aren't any Easter slasher movies but then again there are a lot of obscure slasher movies out there). There is only a half-arsed valentine theme to some of the murders earlier in the movie but the main problem is it seems very incongruous that this isolated and rugged mining town makes such a big deal out of valentines day. The setting of the movie in such a place works well and it is refreshing to have a group of blue collar mining types as our main characters than the usual insipid teens. Despite this however the valentine theme would probably have made more sense and worked better with the standard high school/college setting. For the mechanics of the story the whole valentine day dance thing could easily have been replaced with some other more fitting traditional event.The films main strength is the setting, that of the mines where most of the action, in the second half at least, takes place. It is an effective and claustrophobic setting. The killer's mining gear get up is a bit silly but it works and the bulky suit and helmet makes for lumbering and eerie menace. A good sense of atmosphere and suspense is generated but the film has obviously being slashed up in the editing room worse than any of the victims, and not only are we deprived of gore but the flow of a lot of scenes and of the movie is disrupted. There are a lot of scenes which seem to leading up to something with no payoff- which isn't to say that implied violence can't work in these kind of films but this one isn't put together in such a way and it feels slightly unsatisfying for it. The plot is purely by the numbers but the revelation of the real murderer, whilst not a great surprise is at least not blatantly telegraphed as it is so often in these movies. The killer's motivation is so lazy and arbitrary they should almost not have bothered.A lot of time in the early part of the movie is spent on a love triangle which is kind of dull and outside of the trio involved almost not time is spent on developing the other characters. The acting is okay, if unexceptional, with the actors at least giving some personality to their underdeveloped characters. Not much, but they seem a little realer than their bland US brethren from other slasher movies. On the whole you could do a lot worse if you want to watch an old school slasher movie- it is a bit dull and doesn't quite work all the time but it has some things going for it such as the setting and a slightly different flavour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Valentine's Day 1959, there's a traditional Valentine's Day Dance taking place and no one wants to miss it, with all the excitement a couple of supervisors of the local mine leave their workplace unattended. The outcome is a serious explosion leaving 5 men under the debris, 4 die but they manage to rescue one man after several weeks, Harry Warden. One year later, Valentine's Day, Harry has his revenge, killing the two supervisors previously mentioned, he tears the heart of one of them and sends it in a heart shaped box with the warning that no more Valentine's Day dances should occur, otherwise... Twenty years later the city decides to bring back the annual event and people start getting killed in the exact same way as Harry promised they would. The sheriff doesn't make the case public to avoid panic but eventually decides to call off the dance. That doesn't keep the local miners from organizing their own party that ends up, guess where, yes at the mine but the killer has its own plans for that long February 14th night, partying isn't it.I'm sure that the X rated version must be much more entertaining but the version i watched (R) isn't bloody enough. The outcome of the love triangle is rather predictable along with everything else. The pick ax was a good choice for a weapon but as i said, i just didn't see it in action enough and for some reason one of the killings was done with a nail gun, not very logical. The movie leaves the possibility for a sequel, I've heard the results of the first one weren't good enough for that to happen. There's lots of movies much worse and surely with worse results that had sequels, i think this one should has well, bloodier please.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>original cut would be better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just bought My Bloody Valentine on DVD and was impressed with it. However, it is very apparent that it has been heavily cut in order to receive an "R" rating. It is my belief that the producers of the film wanted to forego suspense in favour of gore. Since so many cuts had to be made viewers are now left with very little suspense and not enough gore. However, the director still creates good atmosphere throughout the film, thanks to wonderfully creepy locals and a menacing and truly scary killer. One can only imagine how good this film could be if an un-cut version were ever released.While the film was pretty good I thought that just as it should be getting going it starts to run out of steam. The climax of the film, where the suspense usually really starts to build, is left barren. The film starts to drag its feet and the killer is rarely seen. My guess is that this is where the viewer is suppose to start guessing who the killer really is and the fun lies therein. However, it is rather obvious who the killer is so the revelation is not surprising. The director makes up for this by having a wonderfully creepy ending. It screams sequel but I liked it. My Bloody Valentine is an uneven film. Not much in the story department but what do you expect? Some nice kills, minor suspense and creepy locations make this film a cut above the rest of the 80's slasher genre. I know there is a better version of this film out there and would love for the film company to release the original edit. My Bloody Valentine is a classic just waiting to happen. My Bloody Valentine rates a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over 20 years ago in the mining town of Valentine's Bluff. There was an accident in the mines that certain workers were left accidentally and there was a big explosions. There was only one survivor Harry Warden (Peter Cowper), who was find after six weeks in the mines. Which he was eating the dead bodies of his friends for survival. Then an year later, Harry murder those who were responsible for the accident and he was sent to a mental institution. Now this little town want to celebrity Valentine Day as they used to back 20 years ago. When an human heart appears in a valentine chocolate box and a middle aged woman was killed. The local sheriff (Don Francks) tries to keep the murder a secret. Until a group of miner workers and their girlfriends make an secret party in the mine. Which they don't know that the woman, they knew is murder. Which the sheriff told the public it's a heart attack. While he's working on the case. But the murderer is actually striking fears again in this small town and for these young 20's something people for them, it's a night, they will never forget on Valentine's Day.Directed by Québecois filmmaker:George Mihalka (Les Boys 4, La Florida, Relative Fear) made an atmospheric horror movie that is quite stylish. The mining location gives this film an creepy look as well. The largely unknown Canadian cast are surprisingly likable. This technically well made horror film was following the foot steps of "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th". It more resembles to "Friday the 13th" in this movie. But this one has some genuine suspense, although the some of the death sequences suffers. Because the MPAA and Paramount really cut this movie down. This movie could have used some of the extra blood for giving an stronger impact.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an decent Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono Sound. Paramount couldn't even give us the original theatrical trailer. There was rumors that One of the producers kept the uncut print of the movie and he tried to convinced Paramount to release an Director's Cut of this film with the full uncut death scenes with some additional scenes, which it had an running time close to 100 minutes. But Paramount said no, too bad because this movie has an huge cult following. Even the director had an ideal of the sequel after 20 years but Paramount said no as well. Because of the low box office run in 1981. If "My Bloody Valentine" was made today, it would be very different for today's standard. The death scenes would be trimmed a bit, comparing to more than 20 years ago. Where Horror Movies had it badly, due of the MPAA. This picture is one of the better slasher films at its time, but it's more of a suspense-thriller with a love triangle subplot. This horror movie is nearly bloodless, due of the Pre-Release cuts. But it's well done film and there's a few good jolts in here as well. Don't miss it. Unusual music score by Paul Zaza (A Christmas Story, Porky's, Prom Night). (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Valentine, I give you my bloody heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the quiet mining town of Valentine Bluffs, they are preparing for their first annual Valentine dance in over twenty years. As a tragic accident involving five miners getting trapped, as their supervisors left early to get to the dance. There was only one survivor, Harry Warden and he was taken to a mental institution. He's released and returns back to the town to kill the two supervisors, and leaves a nasty mess in some candy boxes. He then warns that he'd return if the town celebrated Valentine's Day again. Even with these warnings the young townsfolk (with a crash-wreck love triangle between TJ, Sarah and Axel) go ahead with their plans, but trouble soon arises when candy boxes with bloody treats find their way to the older citizens of Valentine Bluffs and bodies start piling up.What day to pick on the calendar for another slasher? Valentine's Day! By the book, low-budget "Friday the 13th (1981)" cash-in on the 80's slasher craze actually had a novel concept that entertains, despite the lack of blood and gore that supposedly got chopped out. A unique location with a largely dank, gritty, eerie atmospheric embrace blankets the screen and the suspense is well handled with mildly effective death scenes, where the killer mostly plays around with their victim before disposing off them in a vicious quality. Even though it's mostly off-screen. Director George Mihalka ably delivers a solid offering filled with few neat strokes (superb shadow work) and as well he keeps a fairly snappy pace and while John Beaird's story is conventional and derivative to the bone, it still contains some interest because it plays the clichés with plenty aplomb, even the reactions seem plausible and develops into an amusing ending. The three-way love triangle (a lot of eye each other off) interwoven in the plot can slow up the pace, but it's not a massive distraction and the revelation isn't too surprising. Adding to the professional competence are Rodney Gibbons' crisply taut cinematography and Paul Zaza's often bone chilling music score. The acting performances weren't bad by Lori Hallier Paul Kelman (who was always engaging), Neil Affleck, but there was little to like about these characters. Don Francks really makes for the only likable turn as the concerned Chief Jake Newby.Above-average slasher that I would love the uncut version to some day see daylight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, "My Bloody Valentine" is one of the early 80's horror movies that just doesn't deliver the goods. You've got a killer running around who the audience doesn't really care about because your not supposed to know who it is, a bunch of ugly, fat, older 20's somethings with bad accents that as characters are neither appealing or worth caring about, and some cheap special effects that just don't do the trick.The movie plays as a "whodunit" which is probably it's biggest setback. It's not worth trying to figure out who the killer is when all of the possibilities are badly acted and characters without much development. This would have played much better as a straight "physcho kills teenagers" film.The special effects aren't all that great either. Gimme some hot teenagers running around the forest any day over these hillbillies hanging out in the coal mines.Disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Bloody Valentine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Mihalka's fully restored MY BLOODY VALENTINE was finally being seen by devoted slasher fans like myself who have opined about it's forcibly excised gore footage remaining left out for decades despite the glorious nature of DVD. Giving the film new life, we can finally enjoy it the way it should've been seen 20 years ago. While the setting(..a spooky mine shaft), killer(..the miner costume, helmet, and gas mask), and the strong characterizations remained intact, there was always something missing. Seeing the gore inserted(..a bit obvious, but not enough to distract from the experience, or not at least to me)where it belongs adds a nice jolt(..or punctuation mark)to each attack, providing a more satisfying punch left untempered in the film's original castrated release.A mining town(..the kind of place where dreams die a slow, agonizing death)plagued by the memory of a deranged psychotic, Harry Warden, who murdered several folks he held responsible for the methane explosion that killed his fellow workers and buried him alive. When this town, Valentine's Bluff, decides to hold a new dance after not having one for 20 years, the killings start up again. The killer wears a coal miner's uniform and gas mask(..with the helmet light often shining in the faces of those he surprises)often plunging his pick axe into the torsos of surprised victims. Could it be Harry Warden? Chief Jake Newby(Don Francks)and Mayor Hanniger(Larry Reynolds) decide to cancel the Valentine's Day dance after party organizer, Mabel Osborne(Patricia Hamilton), a beloved member of the community, is found inside a spinning dryer in the local Laundromat, heart cut from her chest. Undaunted, the young adults, accursed to belong to such a dead end town, want to have some fun(..instead of the usual action inside the local pub)and decide to host their own Valentine's party at the mine, inside the eating cafeteria. But, they have not idea what horrors await for many of them, particularly the ones who decide to take a little visit into the mine as the killer hides within, ready to strike from any dark corner. The film is mainly centered around a love triangle between TJ Hanniger(Paul Kelman), the mayor's son who left for The West Coast finding tough luck returning home a failure, his former high school flame, Sarah(..the lovely Lori Hallier)he left behind, and her current beau, Axel(Neil Affleck). While TJ and Axel's friendship deteriorates, they will have to join forces, heading into the mine to find Sarah, who has went in with her best friend Patty(Cynthia Dale), Cynthia's boyfriend Hollis(Keith Knight), goofy cut-up Howard(Alf Humphreys), and another couple who merely serve as the typical love-making kids who die at the killer's hand while doing the nasty in the engine room. Like many of the film's supporters, I like this slasher's setting, a blue-collar town where there are few career options available. I think the cast of characters are likable enough. The love-triangle isn't too overbearing and provides decent-enough sparks which infused friction into the slasher story. The costume of the psychopath, the boogeyman tale of Harry Warden, the closing song about his grip on the town, and the neat hunting ground of the killer as he pursues victims in the mine all, I felt, help enhance this slasher from the doldrums many others find themselves..repeating the same repeated cycle of Jason Voorhies or Michael Myers.As I mentioned, many of MY BLOODY VALENTINE's fans had anticipated for the uncut release for quite a while, not necessarily holding director Mihalka responsible(..what can a filmmaker do when a production company guts your films?)for the long-standing neutered release because the Canadian cast and the better-than-usual characters, developed effectively by the filmmakers, add quality to the film. But, the gore-scenes returning to the film as Mihalka intended needed to deliver and I was pleasantly surprised that several sequences are superbly executed, such as the pick axe embedded into the jaw of a victim with such impact the eyeball protrudes, with my favorite being the poor girl who is lifted from her feet, impaled on a water pipe. Of course, the nail gun kill, while not gory, does make one cringe, and when a trapped character severs his arm, it certainly packs a wallop. And, the killer gets to slam his pick axe in torsos and one victim's face is buried in boiling water used for cooking hot dog wieners! Even a ghastly heart removal and a body's discovery in a laundry mat's clothing drier are included to the gorehound's delight. Each and every additional scene add just a little more power to the film, and it was great seeing them for the first of many viewings in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring slasher rubbish with a good location</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "My Bloody Valentine" when it played theatrically and I was bored. It's up to scratch technically, but it's just another slasher about a dead miner who shows up on Valentine's Day to kill young lovers because they're busy doing what he never got to do. That's it.The film, prior to earning its "R" rating, was considerably gorier, and I've read much rubbish about how great the thing would be if the gore was reinstated. I can't agree. If it was bloodier, it would still be a boring slasher... but with bloody killings.There is no suspense, the characters are the usual clichés, and many scenes are so underlit we might be watching tar dry. I don't like night scenes you can't even see because real night isn't like that. Our eyes adjust to the darkness after a while and sometimes we use flashlights. A much better slasher than this is "Madman", a film with impressive night sequences we can actually see.The mine location is suitably creepy and probably had potential, but there's no point crying over wasted scenery when quite clearly nobody was up to making much of this thin premise that was probably an easy sell to a studio (Paramount) that was hot for special occasion-based/date-based horror after "Friday The 13th" poured millions into its coffers.The idea of "My Bloody Valentine" is much more interesting than the reality of slogging through its turgid scenery. Try it yourself if you don't believe me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is definitely an above average slasher movie. I don't recommend it to non slasher fans, but for those who are it's worth a view. Some of the scenes I was laughing out loud due to the male characters. Where did they find these guys and why did they cast them. They all look like their either over thirty, overweight, or just plain dorky. The girls paired up with these goofballs must have a very small selection of men to choose from in their town. You will understand when you see this film. During the first ten minutes the men have a shower scene and some playful grab assing on the way to the bar. It was some of the gayest sh** I had ever seen, very funny. It's too bad this movie was edited down so much on it's release since the gore and special effects in the uncut version are what make it a good slasher film. It's been given justice in the DVD release though. I'm not a big remake fan, but I am looking forward to the 3-d remake.</fullReview>

The quick pace at which the film goes really sets it apart from it's slasher counterparts of the time, the storyline is believable, the acting is campy to be honest but it's 1981 folks! After a second viewing, and now finally being able to watch the film as the director intended it to be released as (uncut), this film has definitely grown on me a bit. I can honestly say that I'am very happy I purchased the Special Edition DVD of this movie, "My Bloody Valentine" definitely ranks in my horror movie favorites. Trust me, if you love your campy slash 'n' dash eighties flicks, and you don't have a better way to spend a Saturday night, then this relic should be right up your alley! WATCH IT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a unique plot, decent acting, a cool soundtrack, and a pretty timeless overall feel, this movie is close to greatness. Ultimately, it misses for me though.It lacks an element of creepiness. I get the feeling that this movie was edited poorly. It skates the thin line between funny and scary. It is not unlike a similar follower that was released 6 years later, "Intruder." (1987) But it never gets as funny...or as gory for that matter. I thought some of the murder scenes were way too tame. The camera seems to cut away at just the right moment.It doesn't have a real twist either. When you find out who the killer is in the end, it's not a huge shock. I guess this movie just left me wanting more. That being said, it's worth checking out on a rainy evening somewhere around February 14th...4 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"My Bloody Valentine" is your average horror flick: several years after a horrible disaster was followed by a series of murders, someone is out to punish those who have forgotten. But like your average horror flick, it's acceptable for what it is. As far as I know, none of the cast members went on to do anything bigger. Speaking of which, is Neil Affleck related to Ben Affleck?. I know of two other horror/suspense movies with valentine-related titles: "Valentine" and "The Caveman's Valentine", both released in 2001. Maybe people just find Valentine's Day a little too sugary and thus try to play with it however possible. This all holds something really special for me as an Oregonian (Oregon received statehood on Valentine's Day, 1859). Weird.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseless slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MY BLOODY VALENTINE is considered one of the tops slashers of the early 1980s. It was released by a big studio, Paramount, and it made a lot of press back then, certainly in Fangoria. I remember reading the Fangoria article and looking at the amazing gore photos, which none have made it into the final film. Once I heard the gore was cut from it, I didn't bother seeing it back in 1981. So, fast forward 23 years later and I've finally saw MBV and I have to say that it's pretty forgettable on all counts. The worst thing about MBV is that it's totally suspenseless. Even average slashers like JUST BEFORE DAWN or THE FINAL TERROR had moments of dread here and there, no matter how brief they were. No so with MY BLOODY VALENTINE. It's totally suspenseless.The film is not bad. But it just doesn't deliver. And the characters are for the most part really annoying or interchangeable. Couldn't care for anyone in the cast.The main problem with the story is the setting. Usually, characters in horror films like FRIDAY THE 13TH or even HALLOWEEN orbit around one specific place (a forest or a couple of houses, like in HALLOWEEN). In MY BLOODY VALENTINE, the story takes place all over the map. You never feel the characters are trapped in one specific area or that they're being hounded. So even while I was watching it 1 hour into the movie, I never felt the (*many*) characters were doomed. Someone gets killed here. Someone gets killed there. Once the story finally takes place in the mines (great claustrophobic setting), by then, I didn't care about anything.There are some good scenes (like when the suits were falling all around the girl. Or the scene at the laundromat), the villain looks creepy and the cinematography is excellent (which is unusual for slashers) but the story/script is awful, the characters are boring, the gore in low, the music is forgettable, and the ending is really silly. But the biggest problem with MY BLOODY VALENTINE is that it's suspenseless. The director obviously didn't know much about thrillers or creating suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than average...but still not that great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes "My Bloody Valentine" better than the usual slasher of the era are good production values (looks more expensive than the usual slasher), some nice location work (especially the mine), and it does have some gritty atmosphere. Unfortunately, the movie is still weak in the acting, writing etc. departments, and even slasher fans will occasionally wince at some dumbness.Oh, this is for samhainfire9, who accused the filmmakers of being liars when they said the movie was cut to get an "R" rating. The movie WAS cut. After John Lennon's assassination in late 1980, the MPAA immediately got especially tough on violence in movies, especially violence in slasher movies ("Friday The 13 Part 2" was another slasher movie of the same time that got heavily cut.) The reason why "Goodfellas" got away with all of their violence was that it was an artful movie (the MPAA is kinder to movies it actually likes) and because Martin Scorsese directed it. If they had given an X to that movie, you can imagine the protests that would come up. And the reason why the movie couldn't be released unrated was that the MPAA forbids the major studios (in this case, Paramount) from releasing unrated movies. (Miramax had to make another distributor to release the unrated KIDS.) Get it? Got it? Good.Anyway, I would like to see the uncut version released one day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Bloody Valentine... Shoegazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine (1981): 5 out of 10: Apparently, if you repeat the mantra &#x201c;this was a classic cult horror film&#x201d;, people may begin to believe you. In particular, if they are young people, who were not yet born when this movie came out in 1981, and they are starring in the 3-d remake coming out in 2009.My Bloody Valentine is a remake (rip-off) of sorts as well. In fact, it is almost plot point for plot point a remake of Halloween. Same escaped mental patient killer as Halloween, same holiday theme as well. They do downshift the social status of the victims by replacing an Illinois suburb with a Canadian mining town, but other than that, it is a very similar film.My Bloody Valentine found itself In competition with such films as Mother&#x2019;s Day and April Fools Day, (One can be thankful that Martin Luther King Jr.&#x2019;s Birthday was not a nationally recognized holiday in the early eighties. One shudders to imagine that holiday themed slasher film.) The film is famous in some circles for getting all of its gore cut out by the ratings board. Combined with a complete (and surprising, considering the actresses and subject matter) lack of nudity, filmgoers in the early eighties could easily have wondered how the film got an R rating at all.Fortunately, a rerelease of the 1981 film on DVD to coincide with the theatrical 3-d remake reinserts the lost footage. Unfortunately, they did not spend the extra money to remaster said footage so it fits in with the rest of the film. As a result, we get a strange spaghetti vision every time a gore scene starts. Despite this, it is an improvement on the original theatrical cut. No amount of edits could solve the fundamental script problems the film suffers from (even by genre standards); and the lackluster killer the movie is saddled with.Overall My Bloody Valentine is a watchable slasher film, especially for those who like the early eighties slasher classics. It could have used more gore and nudity and a much better plot. Something its 3-d remake delivers in spades.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, my bloody valentine. one of the first random slasher movies i've ever actually bought. when i first watched it with my friend, we thought it was one of the worst pieces of garbage we've ever seen, but that was until we saw what lionsgate had to offer. and looking back on it, it wasn't THAT terrible compared to everything else.It has the same general principle of any horror movie. Specific day of the year, killer, random teenagers, all the usual stuff. but like in Shredder, there's a twist! instead of snow, they're in a mine. can't you just sense the terror? no? hm. me neither.Anyway, The movie starts out with a bunch of kids wanting to go have a Valentine's day party in the mine since this is a mining town. why they want to have it in a mine? i don't know. The town finds out there's some killer on the loose like there was 15 years ago or something. But of course, the kids are blissfully unaware. The main male looking like the retarded love child of Raul Julia and Ricardo montobaum, then there's Teddy Roosevelt and.... a bunch of other people i can't remember or care about. Actually, some of the best parts of the movie came from us making fun of the guy who looked like Teddy. We kept saying things like "Bullay!" whenever he came on screen and when he was eventually killed, i uttered the phrase "he spoke softly, and carried a nail gun. bleh" and that was probably the best part of the movie for us. This movie was so boring we actually started having teddy say lines that Teddy never even said such as "The south shall rise again! bleh" Even though that makes no sense, we still thought it to be hysterical. that's the kind of insanity this movie brings.Granted it's not nearly as terrible as Grim Reaper or (shudder) Dark Harvest 2: The Maize, But it's still an awful, boring movie. i nearly fell asleep at two points. i think i actually did pass out for 10 minutes, only to wake up and found out NOTHING happened. It takes too long to do what it wanted to do and doesn't have a strong enough plot in order to do that.Granted, the kills were kind of fun and it wasn't excruciating, just nauseatingly boring. If you're in the mood for a mindless slasher, rent something else. if your friend is making you pick between this or April fool's day or Dark Fields, pick this one. It may be bad, but it's not the worst thing in the world. (even though the ending leaves room for sequel that never happened).My Bloody Valentine gets 3 nailguns to the head, out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"My Bloody Valentine" takes us to the small mining town of Valentine Buffs where the first Valentine's Dance in 20 years is to be held.All those years ago,on the night of the dance,there was a mining disaster that buried five men,only Harry Warden survived and returned the following year to take his revenge and warn the townsfolk never to have such a party again.Now he returns with his pickaxe and the killing spree begins...In its uncut glory presented on Lionsgate's DVD "My Bloody Valentine" is a fairly nasty and gruesome slasher.I never liked theatrical version,because it was virtually bloodless.The original cut of the film had received an X-rating due to its gory violence.For years I had dreamed of getting to see this Canadian mine slasher in its full gory glory and finally those dreams came true.The gory killings trimmed or re-edited in theatrical cut are suitably gruesome for example there is nasty decapitation,nailgun killing and face boiling.The location sets provide plenty of claustrophobic atmosphere,the pace moves swiftly and the characters are interesting enough to care about.8 out of 10.Worth checking out on lonely Valentine's Day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>instead of dumb teens as victims,we have dumb adults who should know better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>for a slasher/horror movie,this one has very little graphic gore,compared to many of the genre.this kinda surprised me while watching it.but then i read a user comment saying that the censors really butchered this one,forcing the filmmaker to leave out a lot of gore.anyway...one thing which really stood out for me about this movie is the acting.well,the lack of,actually.i haven't seen acting this bad since the last time i saw acting this bad.the other thing of note is the stupid characters.many slasher flicks have dumb,oversexed,drunk or stoned teenagers as the victims.that's bad enough.but here we have dumb,oversexed,drunk or stoned adults as the victims.truly pathetic.you can kinda expect it from teens,but adults should just know better.the only good thing about this movie is towards the end,which holds a surprise i wasn't expecting.i won't give it away,so unfortunately for you(or not,depending on your tastes in movies)you'll have to watch the movie.i doubt this will be the worst movie you'll ever see,but for me,it just isn't very good.For me,"My Bloody Valentine" is a 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I heart MBV (uncut).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as the use of 3D lifted the status of the MBV remake from mediocre (6/10) to very entertaining (7.5/10), so the reinstatement of several very gruesome scenes of gore cut by the MPAA transform the original movie from what was just a reasonably fun effort into one of the most effective slashers of the 80s. Yes, the bloody effects really do make that much of a difference!The setting for the film is the sleepy mining town of Valentine's Bluff, where twenty years before, demented miner Harry Warden murdered those responsible for the Valentine's Day cave-in that buried him alive for six weeks, with only the bodies of his dead co-workers for food.With Harry safely locked away in an asylum for the past for two decades, the townsfolk have finally decided to ignore the killer's threat to return should they ever hold a Valentine's party, and begin to prepare for a lavish February 14th bash. But Harry appears to be a man who is true to his word, and soon the bodies start to pile up, their hearts removed and sent to the police inside boxes of candy (complete with bad poetry).Chief Jake Newby (Don Francks) immediately recognises the grisly gifts as Harry's handiwork and cancels the Valentine celebrations; but the young folk of Valentine's Bluff aren't afraid of what they believe to be just a local legend, and hold their own soirée at the pit-head. A good time is being had by all until the mask-wearing killer crashes the party.Despite this being only his second movie, director George Mihalka achieves impressive performances from his equally inexperienced cast, and displays remarkable flair with his visuals, making excellent use of his central mine setting, but it's his willingness to get nasty when it counts that make this one so much fun. He opens his film off in superb style with a credits sequence that sees a couple (clad head to foot in full mining gear) going underground for a spot of slap 'n' tickle; after walking through the gloomy tunnels, she strips off and suggestively caresses his breathing pipe, and he impales her on a sharp spike in return (the point emerging through the heart tattoo she has on her breast!). This impressively grisly scene sets the tone for what proves to be, in it's complete form, an extremely satisfying slasher.In his creepy miner's get-up, the killer is one of the most imposing maniacs of the genre, and the methods he employs to bump off his victims are both inventive and messy: an old lady is roasted inside a tumble dryer; an old guy gets a pick-axe under his chin, which emerges out an eye socket (with the eyeball stuck on the end of the pick?a particularly nice touch!); a girl has her head rammed onto a shower head, the bloody water spraying from her open mouth; a guy in a noose has his head torn off when dropped from a height; boiling hot-dog water is used to drown a bloke; and another poor wretch is nail-gunned in the head! In their uncut state, these revolting moments, made possible by make-up maestro Tom Burman and his team, make MBV a completely unmissable treat for slasher fans.Now if only they could somehow make this film 3D as well...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favourite early 80's slashers, I just wish someone would release it uncut...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine starts deep underground in a Canadian coal mine. Two fully clothed gas-mask wearing miner's stop in one of the many dark cramped corridors, one is a woman (Pat Hemingway) who takes her mask off &amp; unzips her overalls, she has a tattoo of a heart on her left breast. The other unknown miner thrust's their pick-axe into the wall behind the woman, as she suggestively begins to stroke their gas-mask tube the miner pushes her back onto the pick-axe which impales her... Cue opening credits after which an on screen caption informs us that it's 'Thursday, February 12th'. The small mining town of Valentine's Bluff haven't celebrated Valentine's Day for 20 years. A tragic accident in the mine 20 years ago ended with five miners dying &amp; the only survivor, Harry Warden (Peter Cowper) was confined to a mental institution. On the first anniversary of the accident Harry Warden returned &amp; killed the two supervisors (Fred Watters &amp; Jeff Fulton) who he blamed for the accident because they were both at the town's Valentine's Day party instead of the mine, that was 19 years ago &amp; this is the first time the town of Valentine's Bluff have organised a celebration since those murders. Things start to go wrong as police Chief Jake Newby (Don Francks) receives a cut out human heart in a heart shaped chocolate box with a note saying 'from the heart comes a warning filled with bloody good cheer, remember what happened as the 14th draws near...' The next day Chief Newby also discovers the horribly mutilated corpse of one of the organisers, Mabel Osbourne (Patricia Hamilton). Together with the mine's owner &amp; the town's Mayor (Larry Reynolds) Chief Newby decides to cancel the celebrations. Not everyone is pleased with the announcement &amp; a group of miner's decide to hold their own party at the mine, despite a fearful warning from a bartender named Happy (Jack Van Evera). Soon enough 'Saturday, February 14th', the night of the party arrives &amp; everything at first goes well &amp; everyone has fun, but things soon change as the mysterious man in the gas-mask &amp; overalls is back &amp; in an unforgiving mood. Six party-goers think it's a good idea to go down into the mine for a tour, Hollis (Keith Knight), Howard Landers (Alf Humphreys), Mike Stavinski (Tom Kovacs), Sarah (Lori Hallier), Patty (Cynthia Dale) &amp; Harriet (Terry Waterland) head deep into the mine unaware that there is a psycho killer on the loose. Their only hope is Jessie 'T.J.' Hanniger (Paul Kelman) &amp; Axel Palmer (Neil Affleck) who are trying to warn them about the danger they are in, but they too become potential victims for the revenge seeking killer. Or maybe the killer's identity isn't that straight forward &amp; there's more to their motives than just revenge for something that happened 20 years ago?... Will they all make it out in one piece?...Directed by George Mihalka I personally really rather like My Bloody Valentine. The script by John Beaird is well paced, has decent fairly likable characters who aren't quite as stupid as usual &amp; some good kills. It manages to use all the slasher film clichés as well, the character who warns everyone but no one listens to them, the police Chief, teenagers who just want to party &amp; have sex, the isolated location etc, but My Bloody Valentine uses these clichés as well as any other slasher I can think of. I thought the mine setting was cool &amp; gave My Bloody Valentine a nice atmosphere throughout that is all to often missing from films of this type. The script also tries to throw in a twist ending that works quite well &amp; shows that maybe a little bit more thought was put into My Bloody Valentine than one would expect. Technically My Bloody Valentine is solid, direction, good claustrophobic cinematography, acting, editing, special effects, music &amp; in general the production values are better than I expected. Hallier makes for a pretty good leading lady &amp; Kelman makes a decent hero, the acting is better than most slasher film from this era. Now the bad news, the obvious cuts to the gore sequences. The murders in My Bloody Valentine are so cut that at certain points it's not clear what has actually happened, it seems no attempt has been made to smooth over the cuts either &amp; as a result the finished scenes look really choppy &amp; awkward. These cuts also apply to the ending &amp; again it's unclear what has actually taken place which is a problem especially as it affects the end. Unfortunately because of this there is virtually no blood, gore or violence in My Bloody Valentine, a heart in a box, a brief shot of a burned body, a fried face &amp; a bit of bloodless pick-axe mayhem, very disappointing &amp; not really My Bloody Valentine's fault. My Bloody Valentine also suffers from the fact there must be dozens of slasher films that are basically more or less the same, teenagers being killed by a psycho killer so it won't win any awards for originality. Overall I liked My Bloody Valentine quite a lot, it's become one of my favourite early 80's slasher (&amp; there's plenty to choose from) because of it's unusual location, polished production values &amp; good, if bloodless, kills. Definitely worth watching, it's just very frustrating as a film goer that My Bloody Valentine could have been even better without the interference of an outside body only interested in censorship &amp; a distribution company only interested in money. Better than I expected &amp; in my humble opinion an all round good, solid, atmospheric, well made horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well it was inevitable, I guess? After the most obvious calendar days got turned into easy and highly profitable slasher horror movies ("Halloween", "Black Christmas", "New Year's Evil", "Happy Birthday to Me", "Friday the 13th"?), the uninspired scriptwriters rapidly moved on to fake and stupid holidays that don't even deserve any commercial hype. Valentine's Day is a pretty pointless holiday so it's only normal that it received a pretty worthless slasher picture attached to it. Although that statement might be a bit harsh, since there are definitely some good elements to find in "My Bloody Valentine". The whole background of the killer as well as his outfit, for example, is quite terrific. In a little coal miner town with an appropriate name, they plan to have the first Valentine's Day celebration in twenty years. The last time turned into a drama when the mines' security guards left their posts too early in order to attend the party and a handful of workmen got trapped inside and died. The sole survivor of this accident went crazy one year later and killed the nonchalant security guards, resulting in the cancellation of the annual Valentine's dance. The younger generation now wishes to continue the tradition, even against the will of the mayor, and this naturally starts a new killing spree. The available DVD-version of "My Bloody Valentine" is severely cut and therefore very unsatisfying for fans of early 80's horror. Pretty much every killing happens off screen and we mostly just see the terrified reactions of the others as they're exposed to their friends' bodies. Very, very lame! This easily could have been a great slasher, since there are many characters (= wide selection of ingenious killing methods), but instead it became a boring and overall bloodless thriller. The complete lack of bloodshed makes it all the more difficult to forgive the rest of typical slasher-flaws, like dumb dialogs, incompetent acting performances and the really poor twist at the end. Skip it, unless you have the desire to really see every 80's horror movie that ever got released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MY BLOODY VALENTINE (George Mihalka, 1981) **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the myriad early 80s slashers made in the wake of HALLOWEEN (1978) - but actually originating with BLACK Christmas (1974) - revolving around some holiday period. The film offers all the usual trappings: scares, gore, a little nudity, teenagers (comprising the romantic triangle and the inevitable obnoxious clown), state/law officials, a childhood trauma, an old-timer's warnings going unheeded by the kids, etc. As such, it's no worse (or better) than many of its ilk - at least among the few that I've watched myself - but the mining-town setting does provide novelty value and a little atmosphere (though the sight of the masked pickaxe-wielding murderer, whose identity isn't too hard to guess by the way, eventually grows tiresome!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine (1981) ** (out of 4) A small mining town cancels all Valentine Day events after a mine cave in where one survivor later killed several people. Twenty-years after this event the locals teens decide its time to party and sure enough the maniac shows back up to kill. This slasher seems to have a rather big following but I'm not one of its major fans even after viewing the "uncut" version via the recent LionsGate release. For a horror movie this isn't too bad but it certainly can't compare to the better films of the genre including several of the Friday the 13th movies as well as The Burning, which might be the best of the slasher era films. The biggest problem I have with this movie are the characters and the performances. Yes, you shouldn't expect Oscar worthy material but there are too many times where the performances left me wanting to smile or laugh and this isn't a good thing. Another issue are the characters themselves because I really didn't care for any of them. The love triangle side of the story never really works because it's so underwritten. The final issue I have with the film is some rather weak direction, which doesn't allow the movie any atmosphere or tension. I'd be lying if I said there was a single second of fear in this movie and it's a real shame because an underground mine allows for plenty of darkness but nothing is done with it. The film has plenty of scenes where the killer jumps out at you and there's even a "jump" scene at the end but none of them work too well. What does work are the special effects, which are pretty good especially when viewed in their uncut form. The pick axe through the eye is probably the highlight of the movie but there are other goods ones including the boiling water and another scene where a heart is ripped out. This type of movie is certainly made to show off various killings and it does live up to standards on that level. I just need a little more to go along with that violence and this film doesn't have enough for that. Horror buffs will certainly want to check this out but the genre does offer better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More slasher crap from the eighties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would seem that even deranged psychopaths don't just kill for any reason. Calendar dates always provide these lunatics with a great excuse to go around butchering people; we've had Halloween, Prom Night, Christmas...god knows what else; and now we have Valentines Day. Naturally, the resulting film is just as pointless as all the other slashers, not to mention the day itself. The plot is completely ridiculous, and takes in themes of Valentines Day dances and miners being killed underground. The story behind the killing this time around revolves around the only surviving miner of a disaster at the local mine. While he was trapped underground, the town happily enjoyed themselves at the Valentines Day dance...much to their peril as he returned the year after, with his pick-axe! All this is conveyed through a very corny voice over, and the main basis of the plot takes place at 'present day'. It's been twenty years since the nasty miner went around murdering people, and the town has decided that enough is enough! It's time for a Valentines Day dance...but women aren't the only ones who'll be breaking hearts this February 14th...The whole miner idea is ridiculous because it's so far removed from the holiday that the film seems so keen to focus on. The scriptwriter uses the excuse that the miner was trapped on Valentines Day; but that's amazingly flimsy. Why not properly tie the killer in with Valentines Day - how about a bitter kid who never gets any cards, for example? It seems that the whole miner thing is just an excuse so that they can have the killer parading around in a gas mask...because as we all know; all the best killers wear masks. The idea of having him roam around with a pick-axe is a fairly good one, as this robust weapon isn't used too often in slasher flicks; but the murder scenes are disappointing in the extreme, as there's very little blood and most of the action takes place off screen. The climax takes place down the mine and lasts for about half an hour. This goes on for too long, and although I wasn't tired while seeing this film; I soon found myself battling against sleep. The final 'twist' leaves a lot to be desired also. This film is just your typical, everyday, eighties slasher and therefore not worth ninety minutes of your time. Unless, of course, you love seeing dumb teens being picked off by a dull killer.</fullReview>
