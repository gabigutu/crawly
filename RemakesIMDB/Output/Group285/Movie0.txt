		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine 3D is one of those really rare kinds of horror flicks. It delivers buckets of gore, brisk pacing, and a lot of in your face 3D goodness. Sit close to the front of your theater for the maximum effect (if you dare!). There is brutality in king size portions, sure to satisfy the most hardcore of horror fans. They really pull out all the stops with that pickaxe's of his. Perhaps most importantly though, the production and marketing teams were aware of what it what it was. At its core, its a cheesy mindless slasher film, and rather than try to overcome this, My Bloody Valentine acknowledges this trait and works with it. It owns it. Internet ads bore slogans such as 'Its actually 4D if you're wasted.' Never does it get bogged down trying to patch together an airtight story. It just keeps its unrelenting pace up from start to finish, and delivers what the audience came out to see, gratuitous violence.A film like this is quite refreshing for the genre, not because it is artful by any means, but because it embraces its inherent trashiness. By deliberately failing to take itself seriously, My Bloody Valentine becomes something more than the majority of its peers can ever be. It becomes fun in the same way that a Poison concert or monster truck rally is fun. Take my advice and see this thing as it was meant to be seen, through beer goggles and a pair of cheap 3D glasses. Enjoy it for what it is and don't worry about the second thoughts you might have tomorrow morning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full-fledged throwback to the golden age of slasher films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie titled My Bloody Valentine is clearly non trying to pander to art house crowds, nor does it even seem to be reaching for a higher ilk in the horror genre, but while appearing as a fully tacky horror movie entry (a 3-D remake) My Bloody Valentine succeeds in avoiding and ultimately reviving the never ending pitfalls of such films; a strong, unique opening and a surprising and completely plausible, non-ridiculous finale. Unfortunately the movie is not as strong as its bookend acts, but it is certainly gory, fun, terrifying, tense and nothing but entertaining. (And yes, there is also nudity). The use of the trademark, in your face, 3-D tactics is mostly restrained, although it seems that director Patrick Lussier (who has mostly been in horror movie limbo since he directed Dracula 2000) could not avoid the intermittent pickaxe to the screen. The performances are actually quite strong, and while this is becoming more the norm in horror films, MBV even forgoes the smart-alecky, prankster character which removes the propensity for us to be taken out of the film.The unique opening is actually a three-tier start. Flashing newsreels reveal that the collapse of the Hanniger Mine in a small town which claimed the lives of 6 miners (Or was it something else that killed the men?). Awakening from a comma years later, the sole survivor of the cave-in, Harry Warden, picks up where he left off, slaying dozens before being killed himself concluding what the town dubbed the Valentines Day Massacre. But all is not what it seems, as 10 years later Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles), a near-victim of Warden, returns to the small town to sell the mine but the killings suspiciously begin once again and it is up to Tom to clear his name.My Bloody Valentine is a full-fledged throwback to the golden age of slasher films, like Friday the 13th (and is ironically better then the Friday remake this year) and never for a single second tries to be anything it's not and in doing so, it ultimately becomes something it shouldn't be; fun.6.5 / 10.0Read all my reviews at: simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I missed out on the 80's 3D craze- films in the Jaws, Amityville and Friday the 13th franchises all getting 3d instalments on the big screen. Well it seems 2009 will make up for that, with My Bloody Valentine, Final Destination 4 and Pirahna all adding an extra dimension to their proceedings.My Bloody Valentine is a great start. It's fun, gory, doesn't spend too much time on the dialogue, because it understands we're wearing these ridiculous glasses for a reason! I really enjoyed it actually- and for someone who has watched so many slashers, the 3d did add some wonderful novel touches, so it felt like more than just a retread. I know it's cool to bash remakes these days (and admittedly so many are very weak) but I much prefer this to the original- which seemed to plod along at quite a pedestrian pace, and besides the mining town setting, really didn't offer anything especially new. This film is far tighter and doesn't take itself so seriously- it has its tongue-firmly-in-cheek.The only downsides are perhaps the stalk and kill sequence involving a naked lady. I guess some horror fans like their nudity, but in a genre so often viewed as misogynistic, it didn't do itself any favours. Admittedly the character is actually quite strong and fun- you don't feel her nudity weakens or humiliates her, but... I dunno, perhaps pandering a little too much for the teenage boys? Go catch this at the cinema, take a few friends, and enjoy an hour and a half of silly fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a remake of a Canadian horror film that I grew up with and is still very dear to me. Even though I don't think they make great horror films these days, the 3D gimmick was too much to pass up. And it's nice to see that the original motivated someone to try and remake it. That said, this film is nothing extraordinary, but worth it if you have some time to kill. And be prepared to pay extra since this is a 3D film. They charged me an extra two bucks for the glasses. It isn't often you pay $9.50 for a movie at 3 in the afternoon, but what the hell.The film is faithful to the original in a few ways. Using many of the same names and the mining community for the setting. The story centers around the aftermath of a violent rampage by a coal miner ten years earlier. And a spate of grisly new killings that coincide with the arrival of a young man who left town at the time the original murders took place. Is it just a coincidence, or is the young man picking up where the murderous miner left off? This time around, the script has a lot more going on than in the original. Sometimes a bit too much, but the action is spread out to more locations than just the creepy old mine. There is a very strong amount of gore that the original sorely lacked (thank you Paramount). You will see people mangled in just about every way you can kill someone with a pick ax. This film even recycles the dead body in the dryer shot from the original, too. It seems like they made a point to be much more graphic for the fans who had always complained about too much gore cut out from the 1981 version. And the 3D was a nice treat. It looked very good, even from the rear of the theater where I was seated. And a man in full mining gear is still a very scary sight.I expected problems with the script, and I was correct to do so. Much of the dialog is very weak, and it seems like they used a test audience to pick the actual killer since it really could have been either of two people. Some of the acting was more than passable, and it was good to see Tom Atkins working again. The locations above ground were more lush and not as economically depressed as they looked in the original. And this kind of hurts when it comes to creating a spooky atmosphere. There are a couple moments during fight scenes where the actions of characters produced groans from the audience due to stupidity, and I really doubt the county sheriff of such a supposedly impoverished area could afford such a nice home and a housekeeper. I guess the film was still as good as I thought it could be, and I'm not a worse person for having seen it. 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Bloody Valentine 3-D A Deadly Blind Date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The use of three dimensional effects have not been a part of cinema for over twenty years, with IMAX the exception, but now it is back and better than ever in 2009. During "My Bloody Valentine 3-D," the audience will experience large pickaxes, flying bullets and tree limbs coming out of the screen and into your lap. At times the effect seems gimmicky as the story forces the occurrence of projectiles moving through the air and other times the three dimensional effects hit it just right. When you see the film you will know when the effect works; the mesmerizing visuals are sometimes jaw-dropping, literally.Writers Tom Farver and Zane Smith keep the pace up throughout "My Bloody Valentine 3-D," right until the end when it appears that a miner, with grievances will take on a whole town. Right from the beginning the story starts off with a woman on the run from a mysterious figure, behind a breathing mask who seems to delight in wrecking other people's good time. The start to the movie is explosive and the film does not back down from creating a suspenseful horror flick that is simply out to horrify and be fun. At times the dialogue or introduction of characters into scenes comes off as slightly campy, but the delivery of lines in each scene is generating intensity for the final climactic act.The plot of this horror film is somewhat conventional with Tom Hanniger returning to his hometown in order to heal some past misgivings at the hands of a bloody serial killer. "My Bloody Valentine 3-D," mostly centres on the character of Tom Hanniger, with Sarah and Axel Palmer supporting. Adding enough smaller characters to keep the story complex and creating enough diverging plot lines to keep things tight "My Bloody Valentine 3-D," does a good job of keeping the killer's identity mysterious while piquing viewer's curiosity. Instead of going for a closed box Hollywood ending the film slightly steps it up by leaving the ending open for a sequel. Some of the most successful film franchises come from the horror genre and "My Bloody Valentine 3-D," might be trying to capitalize on future returns by delivering a plot twist that slightly disappoints.Lighting, environments, and music are all spot on, only the overacting of certain characters distracts from an otherwise excellent horror film. Many of the scenes within "My Bloody Valentine 3-D," take place in darkly lit mine shafts or the interiors of houses, at night and the overall tone feels like a thriller while showing enough gore to entertain horror fans. The music in the film is subtle enough while picking up the pace slightly during action sequences. On the other hand, the musical score of "My Bloody Valentine 3-D," could have been much more eerie in order to build up further tension. The acting of Jaimie King comes off as pretentious and somewhat naive while Kerr Smith, appearing to take his role of a small time sheriff a little too seriously displays some awkwardness. The rest of the actors including veterans; Tom Atkins and Kevin Tighe play their smaller parts well; Jensen Ackles, could have taken a darker approach to his character, in order to truly deliver a role of someone who is struggling with the trauma of past brutal events but the portrayal is still good.Overall "My Bloody Valentine 3-D," delivers an entertaining ride through dark alleys, mine shafts and the evil minds of writers Todd Farmer and Zane Smith. Slightly on the lighter side of the horror genre this film develops enough jump scares, with the help of three dimensional effects to deliver a fun and fast 101 minutes. See this one with a friend and laugh out loud when a 20' branch comes screaming at your head (and try not to duck)! 6 Mesmerizing Skulls out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Bloody Valentine 3-D (2009) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake of the 1981 slasher film about a maniac in a coal miner's outfit slaughtering everyone, and a worthy retread of the original. These days there has been a return of sorts to the unrestrained gory days of early '80s slasher films, and this one delivers in all those typical categories you'd expect -- the over-the-top mutilations and gore sequences, the gratuitous sex (including full frontal female nudity) and people getting theirs in a variety of inventive ways. At least it's a step up in that the main cast and victims are not just silly teenagers, but rather silly 20-somethings and older this time out. And it is a very nice bonus getting a return from old timer Tom Atkins as a retired policeman in the mix, too.This film is also released in standard flat 2-D, but I would only have awarded it **1/2, if not for the added gimmick of third dimension, which is really what the fun is all about here. The 3-D effects are well done, seeing things fly off the screen and into your face. One wonders whether they might have taken this even farther with more deliberate situations designed to fully utilize the effect, but what's there is still cool. The "mystery" of the film kept me going back and forth in my guesstimates, up to the final second, so that was an added bonus to the usual trappings that worked for me. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3D is not this slasher movie's only saving grace.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years ago, in the town of Harmony, a horrible mining accident occurred, due in part to the negligence of young Tom Hannigar. Five men were found dead and one, Harry Warden, in a coma. It soon came to light that Harry Warden killed those men to conserve his own air supply. On valentine's day, Harry mysteriously awakens from his coma and goes on a killing spree and ultimately met his end at the hands of the town sheriff, But not before confronting the main characters Axel(Kerr Smith), Sarah(Jamie King) and her boyfriend Tom Hannigar(Jensen Ackles) who still harbors the guilt of causing the accident in the first place. Years pass, teenagers become adults and have families. Suddenly, mysterious killings start to happen again with a very familiar M.O; killed by a man in a mining outfit, similar to Harry Warden's. Axel and Sarah are now married but there is trouble brewing in paradise. To complicate matters, Tom Hannigar returned to Harmony and where he goes, the mysterious killings follow.Is some deranged copycat killer out to make a name for himself by repeating the tragedy from 10 years ago? Or has Harry Warden come back from the grave to exact his revenge on Tom Hannigar and everyone close to him? For the first time, i surprise even myself by saying that i liked the story. Or at least i was mildly hooked by it. Usually stories in such slasher horror remakes are bland and shoved aside in order to focus more on silly teenage shenanigans and gruesome killings. The story of My Bloody Valentine plays with the "mystery" element very well, throwing many red herrings and misleading little clues as to the identity of the killer. Literally everyone is a suspect and this film keeps you guessing up until the final reveal. There is even a small(though weak, but passable) attempt at a tragic love triangle between the 3 main characters which ties in rather well with the whole "valentine" theme of the movie. The characters are at least more bearable than the usual slasher movie fare and easier to get into, emotionally. The acting may be a little stiff at times but i did not expect much good acting from horror genre movies. A mystery story would only work one time around(once you know the ending, the mystery element kinda ends there), so is it worth watching this movie again on DVD or blu ray??? I give it a resounding yes thanks to.......you guessed it, the 3D gimmick.It has been said many times over that the 3D gimmick coupled with some fresh new ways to kill off characters is the highlight of this movie. I never knew one could get so creative with a pickaxe and shovel. The gore itself is not gratuitous but the kills are shockingly gruesome and some of them rather unique.(my favorite is when the killer shoved a shovel into a girl's mouth and cleaved her face in half). Really must hand it to director Patrick Lussier(also directed Dracula 2000) for his clear straightforward directing style which keeps the usual frantic cuts to a minimum and allows the violence to be played out in its full gory.....i mean glory. Of course, what would a slasher film be without some mandatory nudity? Thankfully, the nudity is played more for laughs than to titillate here as a dumb blond runs around a motel and car park, completely buck naked in the middle of the night, trying to confront her boyfriend and then trying to escape the killer.In retrospect, My Bloody Valentine actually plays out like an extremely violent episode of Scooby Doo complete with surprise ending and unmasking. There were some issues with the overall "feel" of the non-3D portions of the film which felt cheap and at times looked no better than a made-for-TV miniseries. Slasher genre fans are sure to love this and casual movie viewer can easily immerse themselves in the well plotted mystery and suspense. My Bloody Valentine is a surprisingly fresh take on the slasher genre. It takes familiar elements and adds a new twist to it. This movie among other recent slasher remakes is like a breath of fresh air after spending hours in a gas mask. Definitely one of the better ones in the market. Maybe there is hope for the slasher genre yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine 3-D pulled out all the stops and is every bit worth the ticket price. I admit that my expectations were pretty low at first, but as a horror fan and a 3-D fan, I went to the theater anyway not trying to get my hopes up too much. From the very beginning, the story, action, and the visuals hooked me into it with lots of twists, turns, and shocks. Digital 3-D movies over the past few years have only offered family films or animation in 3-D. Finally, Live-Action Digital 3-D that WORKS!! A MUST see movie if you like blood, gore, and full nudity; all in 3-D! A few story problems in the third act but everything else makes up for it. The movie is meant to be fun anyway, and it was!Bravo to the filmmakers for making this movie entertaining and visually stunning. We are off to a great start in 3-D movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I didn't expect much, but I didn't expect it to be as bad as it actually is! This movie have nothing to offer except some graphic killings, and it seems this is the whole point of making the movie. Maybe it's fun to make gory scenes and maybe the producer thought - hey lets have fun and see if someone will pay to see what we made. The acting is bad to the point of laughable, it's poorly directed and basically you just end up laughing at all the stupidity. Then, maybe this is the point, maybe it's made bad to make fun of the genre or the audience. I don't know, it sure isn't worth watching! You would think they could be a little bit more inventive and creative, it's not that hard! The fact that some people give this movie 10 stars is disturbing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody brilliant 3D experience and a pretty good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine 3D is a remake of the 1981 Canadian slasher film of the same name which I never heard of before this movie was released. The film will have a 3-D theatrical release and is the first film released in Real D which is the main reason why I intended to see this movie because I have never seen a movie in 3D before and I generally like horror movies. Ten years ago, a tragedy changed the town of Harmony forever. Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles), an inexperienced coal miner, caused an accident in the tunnels that trapped and killed five men and sent the only survivor, Harry Warden (Richard John Walters), into a coma. But Harry Warden wanted revenge. Exactly one year later, on Valentine's Day, he woke up and brutally murdered twenty-two people with a pick axe before being killed. Ten years later, Tom Hanniger returns to Harmony on Valentine's Day, still haunted by the deaths he caused. Struggling to make amends with his past, he grapples with unresolved feelings for his ex-girlfriend, Sarah (Jaime King), who is now married to his best friend, Axel (Kerr Smith), the town sheriff. But tonight, after years of peace, something from Harmony's dark past has returned. Wearing a miner's mask and armed with a pick axe, an unstoppable killer is on the loose. And as his footsteps come ever closer, Tom, Sarah and Axel realise in terror that it just might be Harry Warden who's come back to claim them... The 3D experience was amazing and so lifelike which seems like that it is really happening. The movie was pretty good that was best viewed at the 3D theatre although it is another slasher movie which has been tackled a lot of times in Hollywood but I had no problem with it because I had a good time watching it. It is not the kind of film that is going to appeal to everyone and it is best not to take it too seriously. I would recommend it to people who liked movies like Scream. The story is simple and the cast is unknown but it is better that way because then you can just concentrate on the mystery. Overall if want a good 3D experience and/or like horror slasher film then My Bloody Valentine is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom returns to his hometown on the tenth anniversary of the Valentine's night massacre that claimed the lives of 22 people. Wearing a miner's mask and armed with a pickaxe, an unstoppable killer is on the loose. Instead of a homecoming, however, Tom finds himself suspected of committing the murders.Seeing my first 2009 horror film, let alone film, this year, I can tell horror movies are looking promising this year. I'll admit it. The film didn't surpass my expectations, but that isn't fair, since I set the bar up unusually high for these types of films. Yes, I would have never seen this film in theaters if it weren't in 3D. If you're thinking to watch it in 2D, DON'T! Spend the extra $2.50 (or more) because the extra fee is worthwhile. If you don't have a theater with 3D screenings near you, all I can say is that the film will not be as good as if it were in 3D and I stand by this statement.With that warning out of the way, I'll say this is one of the most fun times I've ever had of watching a horror film in theaters. The 3D factor is just an icing on top of a red velvet cake. As a slasher fan myself, I found the film entertaining. I had myself laughing from death scenes that are sometimes ridiculously over-the-top, the gore, the gratuitous nudity, and the horror clichés. This must mean the film is poking fun of itself as a slasher genre or it must mean we're back in the 1980's. I'll go with the latter. But really, does that really matter?The plot was fun, but in films like these, it doesn't really matter either. I had a grand time guessing who's the killer and who's not, just to have myself getting slapped in the face back. It will literally keep you guessing until the end and even if the conclusion has been done several million times before, one will wonder why one would fall for it again. The 3D gimmicks were great and sometimes shocking. You see human body parts flying in your face. You flinch when a pickaxe come flying in your way. It's just that great.I had a mix reaction with the performances. Jensen Ackles was decent, although I had myself laughing from his odd performance. Fortunately, Kerr Smith and Jaime King did a better job. Betsy Rue, the actress who would show her body in full frontal nudity for five minutes in a part of the movie does her part so well that you forget about the nudity (barely). The score is also better than in many other horror films because, really, horror films these days usually have annoying, loud rock songs playing in the background for no apparent reason.In the end, you should really watch, or consider to watch, this film in 3D if you're interested. The kills are great, there's some suspense, and the 3D aspect is really mixed well with the movie that you will have a fun time watching it. If you're expecting something original, don't bother watching it. However, if you like slashers that are similar to those in the past, do yourself a favor and watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody awful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 17 when the original came out at the birth of the so called slasher era: "Halloween" (classic!), "Friday the 13th" (the first one, not all that trash that followed. I still cant watch it by myself at the age of 44.), "Silent Night Deadly Night", "New Years Evil", "Prom Night", the list goes on and on, and the original "My Bloody Valentine" wasn't all that bad of a movie. It had actually had some scary moments in it. Yes it was predictable as this genre of movie goes: crazed masked killer on the loose stalking teenagers!. And it was fine just like it was (as in most original movies) and did not need a remake.I do try to give these remakes (lord I am sick to death with them) a chance to see if they can hold a candle to the original...they never do. Just gore, gore, gore for shock value or it just isn't scary at all. This movie is one of those cases. Too much gore (after awhile one gets immune to it and too much blood just makes it all the more unbelievable), the acting was terrible, suspense was non-existent, the full frontal nudity of one victim...why?, all in all it was just another stupid remake of something that was fine to begin with. Granted though I didn't watch it in 3-D, as the trailer states "A New Dimension of Terror" (I believe the exact words were used in the "Friday the 13th Part 3, 3-D"). I am sure watching it in 3-D would not have helped. It was a terrible movie. I found myself actually yawning.Whatever happened to the horror movie that actually scared you? Things that go bump in the night, shadows in windows, someone watching you and you have no idea they are there, and the best part...you never actually see the killer till the end of the movie. "Friday the 13th" was the best as far as that scenario goes. But the masked killer? "Halloween" was the best in that department.Remake, remake, remake. I do believe Hollywood has just gone dumb and can't come up with anything new without rehashing something that has already been done. Have yet to see a remake of anything that can even come close to the original with the exception of "King Kong". The rest is garbage. And this movie, "My Bloody Valentine" was just bloody awful.Let me try to list some remakes:"Halloween". Rob Zombie ruined this movie. And I like his movies. "When a Stranger Calls". Actually fell asleep watching it. "Texas Chainsaw Massacre". No raw terror there. Just stupid. "Prom Night". Check please! "Carrie". Although faithful to the book, no one can out do Sissy and Pipers' performances. "The Fly". Next! "The Shining". Was no Kubrick film that's for sure. "Friday the 13th". Have no desire to see it. "Amityville Horror". Waste of time.I could go on and on. Hollywood? Do the public a favor and leave classics as they are...classic, and try something new.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the mining town of Harmony, there is an accident caused by the son of the owner Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles) during a drilling, and the mine collapses burying six miners alive. The rescue team finds only Harry Warden alive but in coma and the other miners murdered punched by his pickax, and they conclude that Harry killed them to save oxygen for himself. On the Valentine's Day, Harry awakes from the coma in the local hospital, and he kills twenty-two persons, including a group of teenagers that are partying in the mine. Harry is killed by the deputy but the only survivors are Tom Hanniger, his girlfriend Sarah (Jaime King), their friend Axel Palmer (Kerr Smith) and another girl. Ten years later, Tom returns to Harmony after the death of his father decided to sell the Hanniger Mine, and finds that Sarah has married Axel, now the local sheriff, and they have a son. On the Valentine's Day, Harry Warden also returns seeking revenge against those that had escaped from his pickax in the past, and Tom is accused by Axel and other locals. The slasher "My Bloody Valentine" is an entertaining collection of clichés that keeps tension until the last scene despite being predictable. The greatest attraction of this forgettable feature seems to be the effects of 3D in movie theaters. I have watched at home on DVD and I had lots of fun with the silly and manipulative plot. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Dia dos Namorados Macabro" ("Macabre Valentine's Day")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Saturday was going wonderful, then I meet a few friends at the local movie theater to find out we're seeing My Bloody Valentine. I say "whatever", buy my ticket, grab my 3D glasses, and sit down.The movie starts and gets into the blood and guts almost immediately, which is so abundant throughout the film that it starts becoming comical. I sit here giving the film the benefit of the doubt, hoping that somewhere throughout this god-awful movie a solid story will form that will at least half catch my attention. Unfortunately, that never happened. I sat through an hour of corny dialogue and predictable storyline before I got up and walked out of the room.This is a horrible movie and not worth straining your eyes with those stupid glasses you have to wear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie! I went into it with low expectations but with high hopes and boy did they deliver.The gore was extreme but well placed and the 3D just plain rocked. The acting was well done with great performances by both Jensen Ackles and Kerr Smith. Every twist and turn left me tense and guessing. The pace never slowed, thus keeping me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The ending tied up the loose ends nicely but still left room for a sequel, if the director is so inclined. The bit of a cliffhanger at the end was well done without being too melodramatic yet being complete enough to where another movie is not needed. I will definitely be seeing this again soon!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, the original 1981 movie beats this remake out of the water. From the moment when our killer is in the hotel room taking his pills and the camera zooming right to his face you can tell who the killer is right away! This can make me jump here and there, but to me the gore is nothing compared to the '81 original, there seem to be more talking and less killing and more focused on a love triangle. The 1981 version is better because of the sets and storyline, a dark grim place of a coal mine that looks more abandoned then working would make the film more better. Here it's a working coal mine and is far too modern to be dark and grim. The ending of the 1981 version was more dark and grim and heart pounding that it deserves to have a sequel. This one is just, 'here's the killer thanks for your money!' then credits roll.From the moment when you see the main character in his hotel room and the music along with it and the camera zooming to his face, you already know who the killer is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the mining town of Harmony, a drilling accident is caused by the son of the owner. The mine collapses, burying six miners alive.The rescue team finds only Harry Warden alive, but in coma, and the other miners murdered by his pick-axe.On Valentine's Day, Harry awakes from his coma in the local hospital, and he kills twenty-two people, including a group of teenagers that are partying in the mine.Harry is killed by the deputy, but the only survivors are Tom Hanniger, his girlfriend Sarah, their friend Axel Palmer and his girlfriend Irene.Ten years later, Tom returns to Harmony after the death of his father.On Valentine's Day, Harry Warden also returns, seeking revenge against those that had escaped his pick-axe in the past, and Tom is accused by Axel and other locals....So this was one of the first horror movies to be released with the new 3D fad, and aside from this gimmick, the film is one of the worser remakes around.The 3D gimmick consists of the actors and the killer pointing things at the screen, and it's pointless and by he time you see the killer point the pick-axe at the screen for the fourth time, it grates.And it gets worse on Blu Ray, or should I say 2D.The acting is abominable, narrative stupid and the overall effect leaves a bad taste in your mouth.The overuse of nudity is done distastefully and proves pointless, and this is supposed to be the future?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Useless Remake *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this the night after watching the vastly superior original. The 2009 remake is a complete disappointment. Some of the problems are with the script, others are with the actors, and many are due to poor film-making/direction.One of the things a movie called 'My Bloody Valentine' should feature prominently is the Valentine's Day celebration. There was almost no mention of it being near Valentine's Day, yet everywhere in town valentine hearts are festooned, heart-shaped boxes of candy are passed around, and yet, get this, all the exterior scenes look like late spring. Trees are full of green leaves, blossoms are on others, not a trace of snow on the ground, or ice, or winter in any way. Last I checked, Valentine's Day is in the dead of winter on February 14. This was careless or sloppy or apathetic.I know that some of you might be OK with a movie that has such blatant disregard for the intelligence of its intended audience, but the seasonal incongruity stuck out like a sore thumb.The movie could have been about a murderous miner and it would have worked better or made more sense than trying to tie in to the Valentine's Day theme. Really, just make a movie about a psycho miner, leave the Valentine stuff out, and you immediately have a movie that makes more sense than this mess did.The 'surprise' identity of the killer was telegraphed clumsily about halfway through the movie. The killer is alone in the mines with a guy who is going to be a victim - then we are led to believe that he's in a fight for his life with the boogie man while only about 30 feet from the other guy, who hears nothing, sees nothing, just is oblivious to the shouting, clanging of metal, steel doors rattling, etc. Then the killer comes face-to-face with his opponent in a split screen scene that bluntly and with no ambiguity shows the two as mirror images of each other. Way to go, Director - lack of subtlety reveals the 'twist' far too soon so the rest of the movie is essentially spoiled.There's a lot more that is ridiculously stupid about this movie. Early on the original killer, Harry Warden, is hospitalized in a coma for more than a year. Suddenly he awakens after being in this coma for a year or so and goes on a rampage. Stunningly he has the strength to not only get out of bed, but to literally hack ALL the people in the hospital to pieces and escape. No muscle atrophy for this guy. No hospital security, nothing but bodies ripped in half all over the place.I could go on, but there's no point. I've spent more time on this than this awful movie deserves. See the original - it's superior in every way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, this film in its credit does have a few half descent scenes and to a extremely younger audience could be potentially scary. But to all those fans out their who's older than 16, you wont find this remotely scary. I'm not gonna say avoid this movie @ all costs because as a fellow horror film lover i would choose this over any political based film any day of the week and it can be entertaining. There's just something about this movie that doesn't add up and i don't know what it is funnily enough. However, the twist at the end is very smart but yet quite predictable as it can be seen in many horror films. go out and rent this see what you make of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"what the f*** do you want?", well what else I would want, I want to kill you with my pick-axe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to see My Bloody Valentine back in February on the big screen in its 3D version but eventually I could not. Not quite ago I saw its R1 DVD and I was very glad to find out that it included the 3D version but boy it was just too f****** expensive. So I decided to wait, the R4 DVD was released, it contained the 3D version as well and I finally bought it last weekend. I knew more or less what to expect of this remake of the 1981 Canadian My Bloody Valentine (for the record, I'm one of those who heard for the very first time about the 1981 My Bloody Valentine once its remake had already been released) and in a way I have not many complaints: the 2009 My Bloody Valentine (apparently the official title goes with the "3D" but in IMDb it is listed without it) is not clever stuff, it's an entertaining yet very forgettable movie with a cool-looking killer. And I said that in a way I have not many complaints because I was expecting pretty much what I saw. Now, as for the 3D version I saw, well I don't know about the one included in the R1 DVD but the one I saw last night is just not good. To be short: in many times, mostly when the killer (the miner) was not just about adding someone more to the list of his victims, I was just about ready to change the DVD for the one with the standard version. It was difficult to follow the image, but still some scenes looked really nice in 3D (the pick-axe stuck in the car's windshield for instance). Going back to the substance of the movie, well it's about a tragedy that happened 10 years ago, during a Valentine's Day and that marked some then teenagers. But that tragedy was the return of someone that a year before marked the mining town and that now may be back. "What the f*** do you want?", asks at one point one of the then teenagers to the killer. Obviously there's no answer but just another killing. Of course the movie tries to give some tension and a story to care about the three main characters: we have Tom Hanniger, Sarah and Axel. The first two were a couple 10 years ago but now Sarah is married to Axel (yet he is cheating on her) and Tom is back after 10 years ago (he was almost killed by the miner). The movie says to you who the killer is really very soon but of course the movie tries to confuse you, it's just nothing tense, it's just a, for most of its runtime, decent slasher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slasher movie about a coalminer who axes numerous victims in a little mining town</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on original film directed by George Mihalka , it was a real success in the American cinemas and all around the world . This horror film provides great load of screams , grisly killings and creepy atmosphere which becomes pretty sinister with the miner killer appearing . This bizarre little horror movie is set in a mining town , on Valentine an explosion of methane gas took the lives of a group of coal miners working in the Hanniger Mine . Long time after, Tom Hanniger ( Jensen Ackles ) returns to his hometown on the tenth anniversary of the Valentine's night massacre that claimed the lives of 22 people , male as well female . But Tom finds himself suspected of committing some new killings , and it seems like his old flame (Jaime King) nowadays married to county sheriff ( Kerr Smith ) is the only one will believe he isn't guilty . Later on , a blood-soaked heart arrives at the police station , accompanied by an ominous message. And several people is cruelly murdered , one of then with a signal putting : ¨Be mine forever ¨ . The picture is a sleek production with average budget and packs genuine chills , suspense , tension , and shocks , it's a terror-thriller very exciting . Gory, gruesome , pretty repellent , ghastly and unrelenting shock-feast laced with a loving triangle . The film is paced with intelligent edition , special use of color and slick utilization of shock images that take place in the astonishing close-up crimes committed by means of a pickax . This frightening movie displays terror , shocks , hard-edged scenes , creepy images and abundant nudism in charge of an explosive Betsy Rue . While the look is suitable atmospheric and eerie , the argument stretches plausibility to the breaking point . This is a customary splatter plenty of grisly killing , thrills , gruesome shocks , nauseating chills and quite entertaining . It relies heavily on old-fashioned buckets of blood and the plot belongs the same of 'Slashers genre' in ¨ Halloween ¨, ¨ 13 Friday ¨, ¨Nightmare in Elm Street ¨ style , being recently remade . This is an usual excruciatingly splatter film in which the intrigue, tension , suspense appears threatening and lurking in every room, corridors , hospital , mine , tunnel number 5 and many other places . This unrelenting shock-feast packs good make-up and nice special effects . It's just one long relentless stabbing and acceptable budget horror movie that still packs a punch for those who like to be terrorized out their wits . The motion picture is professionally directed by Patrick Lussier , a good filmmaker and editor expert on terror genre ( ¨White noise 2¨ , ¨Dracula 2000¨ , ¨Legacy¨ and ¨Ascension¨ , ¨The prophecy 3: The ascent¨). This murder-feast that will appeal to gore and guts aficionados.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like Jensen Ackles because he is very good in SUPERNATURAL. I saw this last night &amp; I've to say it was a decent film. I was not expecting anything other than your normal slasher film. But, Ackles should not be typecast only in the horror movie genre because of his hit TV show.The plot is very average. Tom returns to his hometown on the tenth anniversary of the Valentine's night massacre that claimed the lives of 6 people. Instead of a homecoming, however, Tom finds himself suspected of committing the murders, and it seems like his old flame is the only one will believes he's innocent.Ackles plays Tom very well. Tom is a compulsive drug user because of medical reasons &amp; he is very afraid of everything related to his hometown after the deaths. He also wants to rekindle his romance with his ex-girlfriend, now the wife of the town's Sheriff who happens to be his old friend, but cannot do so because it is morally wrong for him. The film throws a few surprises at the ending. I thought the killer was someone else. Edi Gathegi is wasted as the deputy in the film. And the killings were very well done. Overall, a very decent movie.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like this movie. This starts of with an explosion in the mine. Harry is sent to the hospital and put in a coma, then after amount of time he wakes up with revenge. He then starts killing 22 people in his path before the sheriff and deputies catch up to him in the mines with Harry using pick Axe killing people with it and leaving human hearts in chocolate heart boxes for valentines. The sheriff finally kills Harry in the mine while Tom and his girlfriend and his friends are being hacked up by this maniac. Tom and his girlfriend and his friend and his girlfriend make it out of the situation when sheriff kills Harry. Then it switches to 10 years later, when all of a sudden Tom comes back to town from running away from the horror he went through and him leaving his girlfriend to marry his best friend that became the new sheriff of the town. He came back to sell the mines, but after a few killings he decides to change his mind. Then his friend the sheriff become suspicious of Tom and thinks he is doing the killings of Harry like a copycat. The killing keep happening just like Harry did 10 years ago, and Tom makes it look like the sheriff is the killer. Well, pretty obvious at the end you know who is the killer. The first suspicion is correct by the sheriff after Tom gets back to town. It has some twists and turns thinking that it would not be the person that is killing. I did not watch it 3-d which would of been nice. Even seeing it in 2-d, I could tell where it would be 3-d. The ending make it look like a sequel will be out in the future. I recommend seeing it. It might perfect for a every year valentine horror flick. You never know you might turn into a valentine killer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was sceptical of the storyline however, I felt it was greatly acted and the plot on a whole was unique (although it be a remake). The 3D effect was amazing and I felt this really complimented this film. The pick axe flying towards you in a cinema is hilarious if you're on the back row watching the ones at the front. Even if the film in itself doesn't scare you- which it didn't for me. Watching it in 3D will make it worth the watch. To have eyes sitting on your knee is weird but amazing. I hope they continue horror in 3DDVD version, however, the 3D effect is hard to make out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest Movie of the Year......*what do you mean it's not a comedy?*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I laughed. I laughed at the painful acting, at the worse script, at the ridiculous plot, I laughed until I thought I was going to puke. This is a sad exercise in slasher flick stereotypes: characters who are clueless, who are unable to run in a straight line for more than ten steps without doing a face plant, a girl who spends almost half of her screen time in the movie naked (grab a stopwatch it's pretty damn close), and an invincible Roadrunner bad guy. It's also an exercise in bad writing: like a killer who one second is almost superhumanly strong than the next second getting his ass kicked by the Sheriff, or a cop who apparently only carries one load of ammo for his gun (I know this is supposed to be a small town but even small town cops carry at least one reload), or a guy who comes out of a one year coma and is still strong enough to kill twenty-some people in one go (wow if he's that strong after a years worth of muscle atrophy, he musta been a superhero before the accident). As far as the main three actors go: Jensen Ackles makes a lot of use of the two facial expressions he can manage(angry "intensity", and cocky smiling), Kerr Smith spends the whole movie sulking, and Jamie King is....well...hot (so she gets a pass). a great movie for people who watch mindless trash to see gruesome murders, not for anyone who wants entertainment that does not openly mock their intelligence. THIS MOVIE REPRESENTS EVERYTHING THAT IS BAD ABOUT SLASHER FLICKS. And the attempts to "use" the 3-D reminded me of that bit on SCTV with the channel showing 3-D horror movies: the was a lot of him point the pickax at the camera, stuff flying towards it etc. most of it very distracting and fake looking. Ultimately it was a lame, predictable, paint by numbers, unintentionally hilarious crap fest</fullReview>

The acting was incredibly bad and the plot was just too easy to anticipate. The 3D effects were the only ones worth watching, even though in some parts of the film I had the impression that the action skipped its narrative coherence just to insert the 3D moments. Moreover, I was sure I'd find a real low IMDb vote, but the 6.5 just shocked me.Sorry to those who don't share my opinion ... but seriously.. movie-lovers...you have to admit !

		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the worst remakes of a classic 80's slasher\horror film I have seen. I would consider the original 'My Bloody Valentine - 81' to be one of the better slashers of the early 80's period. It was no 'Halloween - 78', but it was full of atmosphere and had plenty of style to boot?this rancid remake was just an insult to my intelligence.There is better acting seen on a daytime TV soap opera. The cinematography and lighting were flat and uninspired ( I am aware it was filmed for 3D, but even this isn't an improvement over watching the 2D version of the film) and the gore and violence didn't have any real impact due to the terrible characterization. If it was intended as a parody of the original version or slasher films in general, it failed miserably because it was so damn boring and uninteresting. Do many of these modern horror film makers have any real passion or appreciation of what makes a decent horror flick become a perennial favorite??? The producers of this travesty certainly had no vision except maybe of their wallets.Avoid at all costs. You have been warned!</fullReview>

I don't see how the previous comment said that by showing it in real 3D or gore, that the movie redeemed itself. It never did. The acting was bad. The suspense was anticipated by the actors, as it is so obvious in a living room scene. If the producer/s of the movie are intending on making a franchise of "My Bloody Valentine", please put it on your living room shelf. I see the movie making career of Jensen Ackles going down the sewers including the rest of the actors. If the kid in the movie wishes to use this in a resume for movie acted in before, please don't.

		<shortDescription>Fantastic 3-D Slasher! - Very mild spoiler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw an advanced screening of My Bloody Valentine 3-D last night at 10pm.What a cool movie! Okay, so basic plot is this guy goes on a psycho rampage in a mine and (very minor spoiler ahead) kills everyone he can get his axe into....except for one guy who is spared due to cops showing up and saving the day by shooting the guy. But he runs out of the mine and no one speaks of him again. Flash forward ten years and killings have begun again. So, automatically, people in the town think that it is the same psycho killer from ten years ago. But they killed him. Didn't they? A trip to the place where he was buried shows no sign of a body and now the mystery begins of is it really the killer from before? If so, did he rise from the dead? Or was he never dead? Or do we have a copycat on our hands? I'm not much of a slasher type movie fan. Couldn't have given two rips about the Jason or Michael Myers series at the beginning of their respective chains (although, I am finding myself enjoying the remakes of these), but even though this was filled (and I DO mean FILLED) with gore sequences, this was a very enjoyable and intriguing storyline...along with having the kick butt 3-D effects, of course! I think the second biggest jump moment for me was the scene from the trailer where he throws the axe and it hits the windshield of the car...that really did look like it was gonna hit me. :] The first biggest, I won't spoil it, but it was really close to the beginning and it totally hit me by surprise.I should probably mention that there's some very nice eye candy for both sexes. All of the girls dress like sluts, whether intentional or "accidental" (what was with the denim cut off skirt where the pockets hung down below the skirt...ugh, how tacky...and the man's flannel shirt with one button too many undone was common...oh and the very first scene, it is almost impossible not to stare at her chest the entire scene because she is wearing a two sizes too small white t-shirt with a black bra underneath...or at least, it looks like it's black...she never takes her shirt off) and there is a scene where you have full frontal for quite a bit of time while the one girl is running for her life and thankfully since you're seeing her for such a long time, she at least has a very nice body. Then the guys...oh, man, I was having a hard time picking out which one to drool over more...Kerr Smith was looking F-I-N-E and Jensen Ackles always has this something yummy about him that comes through when he speaks. (I'm such a sucker for the 5 o'clock shadow look.) One quick note in general about going to see a 3-D movie. As a suggestion...make sure to sit in the center of whatever row you sit in. This evening, I, stupidly, decided that I was determined not to have anyone sitting in front of me, so I picked the second row back, right behind the bars, so I could put my feet up and there was no chair in front of the bars for me to have to worry about that. However, by doing this, even though the effects were still really cool, I didn't really feel like I was enjoying the full effect of the 3-D experience. I had the emergency lights on the floor right next to me and because it wasn't as dark, it was more like watching just a regular movie. So, I assure you, I WILL be seeing this movie again tonight...and I am quite positive that the 3-D experience will be that much better.And for all the horror fans who WILL go see this movie, make damned sure that you stay til the very, very, very end. I promise you, you will not regret it. Was this really a horror movie, though? I mean, we're not talking occult...the killer wasn't possessed by a demon or anything. He was just deranged. This stuff could really happen! That makes it more of a thriller in my book.Anyway, highly recommended, must-see for 3-D fans, slasher movie enthusiasts, or just anyone who likes a good whodunit, since you're kept guessing til the very last scene. Yes, I would go see it, even it wouldn't have been offered in 3-D (I really liked the storyline), but as long as it's still playing in 3-D, you owe it to yourself to find that theater that is showing it and wait to see the "regular" version when it comes out on DVD. Hopefully, though, 3-D will be offered on DVD as well.PLEASE for the sake of your kids' sanity and to be courteous to the other people trying to enjoy the movie, leave the rug rats at home for this one. Not one scene is appropriate for them and your theater mates would greatly appreciate NOT having to tune out your baby crying and screaming (like one was doing last night at my viewing).I can't wait to see this again in about 4 hours!Vixy :]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry Warden is back....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"My Bloody Valentine 3D" is a marvelous rendition of an 80's classic updated with care to create one of the best "remakes" out there. The film does not stray to far from its predecessor yet adds to it in a visually stunning form. Even in 2-D it shines as though it were made back in the 80s! The character development is what I enjoyed the most as it gave a nice change from topless blonde teens running to their deaths. The coal miner "Harry Warden" awakens from his one year coma and wreaks havoc but for a short period as he is gunned down later on. Ten years pass and the town of Harmony wants to forget about this terrible event in their history. Tom Hanniger returns to town to sell his fathers mining facility and catches up with the townsfolk only for a mysterious man in a coal miner outfit to show up and begin a murdering spree. Is it Harry Warden back from the dead or an impostor? The plot to this film is average but the kills are great. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a great night of fright and suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My bloody valentine the remake is a pretty good time, it does have its flaws, but all in all, it delivers on its promises. One thing I didn't like was the extremely graphic sexual content and full frontal nudity, there is even a pretty prolonged scene featuring full frontal female nudity the whole time, I just thought was overload. Also, the gore got to be a little too much, some of the killings were just like oh my god I need to cover my eyes LOL. But other than that, the movie was actually pretty well written, the dialogue was a lot better than usual slasher movies. Jenson Ackles is good in the lead, I thought that was a good casting decision. And the rest of the cast did a well enough job here too, they weren't like the run of the mill stupid horror movie characters, that sure is good to see. The cardboard cut out characters in modern day slasher films are getting pretty darn old! The ending was great! I really did enjoy the ending to this film, well not the very last like 30 seconds, when/if you watch it you'll understand what I'm talking about. The last 30 seconds are kind disappointing, but overall this is a pretty well made modern day remake of the 1981 original horror film. Unfortunately I cannot compare the 2 because I have not seen the 1981 version. 8/10, had to take off points for some of the overly graphic content.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprised me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert!!! Now I typically hate horror remakes but this one has shocked me! I never ever thought a remake was actually better than the original. I saw the original and it was the most unforgiving, useless, unentertaining slasher movie I have ever seen in my life! I think the Prowler and Maniac is way better than it and those films seem just mediocre to me. This remake does have one thing I don't like and that's the fact it shows a girl completely naked. I mean this is a slasher movie I know but she is 100 percent naked. In slashers back in the 80's the worst you'd see is either the girls boobs or her rear but her you see it all! I mean here there's not even a real reason for it! It's the only thing I actually have a problem with in this decent remake other than that I liked the kills and the characters so it's an 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Bloody Valentine (2009)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It looks like utter crap. Video cassette quality. That was a real distraction when it began. The plot for a slasher was kind of interesting at first, though starting with the actual cave-in at the mine would have been nice. It also tried to have some character development with Kerr Smith playing a sheriff cheating on his wife. This made a rather ambiguous hero. This could have been good if it had gone somewhere, but you'll guess the killer pretty easily. It even tries to do a complete 180 with flashbacks, but the whole film made it obvious. It's like the writers couldn't be bothered to put any effort in so they just said "Let's actually make it the prime suspect". All the kills are similar, with a pickaxe used every time. I wouldn't even recommend this to real horror buffs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good or bad aren't categories meant for movies like "My bloody valentine". We all know this is no Orson Wells, no Truffaut, not even Robert Zemeckis. This is just a horror- remake, and a very swell one at that! The dialogs are cheesy, but rare. The gore is amazing, it tops most that I've seen by far. The movie even manages to add some real suspense by the end. The 3D experience made this two hours of good entertainment. Actresses like Megan Boone will be talked about in the future. Extremely hot!!! Of course there's nothing new about this movie, but with all the great gore and the suspense, "My bloody valentine" is at least 100 times more efficient than all the "Scream" and "Saw"- movies put together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Your Typical Slasher movie, 3-D Elements were Nothing Special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 3-D idea a Director would bring to a movie is a good idea, its unique and only works with certain movies, like the horror genre.My Bloody Valentine had a good enough of a plot for me to like this movie. i had seen a lot of slasher movies in the past number of years, and I did feel it was repeating the same thing again for this movie as regards to story and acting. A girl screaming her bloody lungs out as the Killer is her chasing her - same thing in this. The Killer wearing the Gas-Mask was pretty decent as regards to a shocking figure though.As I said the 3-D concept was only OK, the hype like we see in the trailer of this movie I have to say is complete and utter garbage, its good, but its not that good.The story was good, our lead is accused of murders that happened a while back, and then murders start happening again upon his returning, I was very surprised by the ending I must say. I kept asking myself who is the killer? and its always the one you least expect, even if you tell yourself the person who you least expect - it never is.All in all, its kind of a Love/Hate thing going on for me with this movie, its an only OK movie, but the 3-D concept was garbage, and waaaaaaaay over-hyped. It was a way of promoting the movie.Give it a watch though, Its good Entertainment I guess</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whether it is 2d, 3d, or 4d would not make any difference; this is a terrible movie with bad acting, a dumb script and no reason at all for an afterlife on DVD. Six coal miners are trapped after a collapse and five die and one remains in a coma. The survivor killed the other five with a pickaxe. He awakens on Valentine's Day; get it? And he continues his bad behavior with the instrument.The abandoned coal mine is party central for a group of good looking girls and boys celebrating the holiday spirit with plenty of alcohol. The bad man shows up in full work attire for the special occasion with his deadly tool and dispatches some of the happy campers with lots of running and screaming adding to the excitement of this God awful waste of time.

		<fullReview>I've seen it in a theatre in 3D as well, effects seemed really nice but somehow it didn't intrigue me. First of all the 3D special effects got all of my attention and it made it quite hard to watch the movie. The plot was quite easily predictable except for the very last scene, but that was about it. Also wearing the 3D glasses all throughout the film was quite annoying. I totally agree with some of the previous comments that the movie doesn't deserve 6.5... More like a bit over 4, in my opinion, is the most this film should be rated. Of course someone else can see it differently. If I had to guess then the movie is meant to be enjoyed by teenagers and quite likely, people who before haven't seen any other serial killer movies (i.e. Scream, Friday the 13th, Psycho) which I don't believe there are great many.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugly remake of a good horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has nothing to offer besides 3-D and gore. And now that it is out of the theater, the 3-D is no longer important. Ugly and flat cinematography, plastic looking actors, cheap, boring storyline, and zero style. This shameless remake of the stylish 1981 cult classic is on the level of a poor "CSI" TV episode. The interesting but likable characters from the original are replaced by...nothing. Even the pick Axe to the head scenes become boring, repellent as they are. But this film must have known it was garbage, which is why it included full female nudity, of one slightly over-the-hill and out-of-shape actress. (Wow, did i feel sorry for that woman, how embarrassing.) But it has gore. Lots of ugly, sadistic gore. Some of it looks very CGI, unlike the original, which employed some great special effects. gone also is the creepy atmosphere of the original. And rather than focus on the young people of the town, we are given a flat cop thriller. "whodunnit?" Who cares? I don't hate remakes; I liked the changes they did for the new "Nightmare On Elm Street," and found that to be a respectable horror film. This one is just an ugly, forgettable waste of time. But it has GORE!! And BREASTS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mining the slasher genre for nuggets of originality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine 3d is a remake from an old Canadian horror film. It's also a throwback to the maniac serial killer/slasher genre from the seventies/eighties but with some modern touches. First of all, I'm not sure it would have been made and released without the 3d gimmick. I watched it home with standard 3d glasses and the 3d effects were fairly good especially the fences and pickaxes. The only problem of course being that the colors are not as nice as the 2d version also available on the DVD/Blu-Ray. With that out of the way, it's a pretty standard slasher, with a deranged miner with costume and gas mask as the protagonist, but it starts the carnage very quickly without much of a buildup except for some kind of story recap background as if it was a direct sequel (it's not). After a few slaughters, it's 10 years later. That was pretty bold and cool. As you might expect, killings start happening again after an old survivor from the first incident comes back to town.It's never really scary because things happen so fast and because a guy in a miner suit just isn't that horrifying. The appeal comes from the surprise apparitions of the killer, the attempts at escaping and the original gruesome dispatches by the maniac miner mostly with his pick axe and shovel. I suppose it also comes from a very long sequence of a young woman in full-frontal nudity trying to escape the killer. As a side note, most of the story doesn't take place in mines nor is the movie claustrophobic. I enjoyed the mystery of who the maniac guy behind the mask was as it was well presented with a few false leads and likely suspects being offed gradually. However, no clear motivation was offered for the maniac. The ending with the trio (not telling who) was also strong and dramatic. The acting was OK in a TV-quality kind of way, mostly sober although some of the old guys seemed a bit weak. I think the directing was modern and dynamic with good cuts, in more ways than one ;-) So this film is a little above average in the retro slasher genre. It would make a good rental especially with 3d glasses and a few friends.Rating: 6 out of 10</fullReview>

I love a good slasher movie and this movie as all the elements of a very good slasher flick. It starts off like most slasher flicks with the main characters going through some kind of dilemma that involves the killer, then it jumps the story several years into the future with the present. This movie has you blood &amp; guts a pretty good body count, your twist &amp; turns then when it comes to the end of the movie you get your shocking ending like most slasher flicks. I loved the movie till I saw the ending but don't let my hatred of the ending lead you away from seeing this movie because its a really good slasher movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of the original My Bloody valentine, come on killing someone and putting them in the dryer...classic. But the idea of a remake seemed dumb, but the idea of a remake in 3D...AWESOME! So I gave it a try. Holy crap, i'm glad I just borrowed this movie from a friend. There was no plot what so ever, it goes right into the killing and leaves you in the dark from the start. The sad thing is that I thought that the addition of Supernaturals Jensen Ackles would help, but it did not. And as usual, I found the following to be a bit bothersome, so please allow me to vent.....#1-What the hell is the deal with teens and partying at sites where huge mass murders occurred? GO TO THE MALL! Leave the sacred Indian burial grounds alone kiddies.#2-The killer comes into the store and the two chicks hide in the managers office, OK, thats to be expected, then they barricade the door, expected too. Then after the attack on the main chick she decides to push the fire alarm....WHY THE HELL DIDN'T YOU DO THAT FROM THE START? What were you thinking? You had enough time to make a phone call but not push a button? #3-Boobies....I love em, you love em. But when you decide to shoot a guy in a truck stop parking lot....Put clothes on, please. Its cold out.#4-The sheriff is having an affair, sure why not, and they decide to meet in a ratty old falling apart house? Ewwww. Classy.#5-How many explosions can one guy live through? Tom had been in two different explosions and not even a burn on him. Wow, he must have the same tailor as Freddy Kreuger.#6-Wow, the first time that the black guy wasn't killed/or the killer. Good going! #7-Jensen Ackles, did he even change clothes from his job on Supernatural? Half the time I thought I was watching him on TV. There was no difference from that character and Tom.#8-The camera....sometimes the movie had the feeling that it was a ABC movie of the week. The feel was just off.#9-When Bens body is found it is in the middle of the nowhere woods where they 'burried' the original killer. Who found his body? Who was out in the middle of nowhere in the morning going, 'Hey, is that Ben over there?" #10-When you're sitting all alone in your house drinking ourself silly, there is no better companion than a shot gun.Sadly, all in all this movie is just a crappy remake for teens who want to to scare themselves with a big group. And as much as I like Jensen Ackles, he should not give up his day job. If you're looking for a 3D flick with the usual cheap special effects that 'jump' out at you, then give it a try, but that is all you will get for your money.</fullReview>

Being a writer, it is hard enough for me to watch horror movies, let alone terrible remakes that have a poor story line. The first fifteen minutes I was asking myself "Is this a dream?" "When is this dream sequence over?" and to my astonishment, that dream sequence never ended. The twist at the end is hardly a twist, it is more of a predictable let down. I love violent movies. I love bad movies. This one was so bad, but good enough not to enjoy as a campy movie. Oh yeah, I saw it in regular D and you can tell it was shot just for 3D. I am, however, looking forward to Drive Angry 3D. But Nicholas Cage nor any number of brutal kills and tits can't save this movie.

		<shortDescription>Only bother watching this in 3D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MY BLOODY VALENTINE is the noughties remake of a 1981 slasher flick. Normally, I wouldn't give this type of remake a second glance ? I'd hang on until it showed up on television before I bothered watching it. However, something caught my eye when I saw the cinema showing advertised ? no less than the fact that this film was showing in 3D. Yes, 3D cinema is back, the next wave of three-dimensional horror films is hitting our screens in 2009 (THE FINAL DESTINATION 3D and PIRANHA 3D are two coming up), some thirty years since the last wave brought us the likes of Friday the 13th 3-D and Jaws 3-D! I went to the cinema to see this and enjoyed the 3D experience complete with viewing glasses and a rowdy audience and what an experience...First off, the film itself. It's basically a clichéd slasher movie not much different from the ones you'd find in cinemas during the '80s. Some people who saw this film in non-3D cinemas claim it can be enjoyed in its 'two dimensional' version, but that simply isn't true. MY BLOODY VALENTINE is a 3D film through and through, made and designed to be viewed in the format. It's one of those films where things are popping out of the screen all the while and watching a 2D version is just pointless. The 2D version of this film I'd rate as a 1/5. To be honest, the film itself isn't much cop. It's a clichéd movie, with one of those appalling scripts that turns every actor into a complete moron. The twist ending is completely dull and unsatisfying. The acting also isn't very impressive. There's too much of a desire to catch 'hot' actors and actresses to appeal to teenage viewers so we get the likes of lunkheaded Jensen Ackles and Kerr Smith wandering around and being a little embarrassing and out of their depth. Jaime King is passable, but as usual it's the old timers like Tom Atkins and Kevin Tighe who show us what real acting means.I did appreciate that this film does have a good pacing and a nice look to it. Some of the cinematography isn't half bad and the opening hospital massacre is top stuff, a shame the rest of the movie doesn't touch it. The look of the killer miner, swinging a pick axe and wearing a helmet and gas mask, is also brilliant and recalls Jason Voorhees nicely. Horror fans will be in their element with an extremely high level of gore and depravity with eyeballs popping out, heads being impaled, hearts removed and even a guy's chin being ripped off in one gruesome encounter. There's even an extended nude scene that will appeal to male audience members although it does get a bit much with a blonde bimbo parading around naked for roughly ten minutes or so.Which leads me to the 3D effects. They're BRILLIANT. I've wanted to see a proper 3D film ever since I saw the '50s HOUSE OF WAX on television with the guy playing with his yo-yo against the camera and I finally got the chance with this. Gone are the old coloured glasses, this is a new type of 3D technology known as digital projection and it works a treat. Stuff pops out of the screen all the time ? guns, tree branches, body parts, you name it ? but as well as this, the stuff on screen actually looks 3D ? so if you see a car pull up it seems to be jutting out of the screen rather than sitting flat. For the 3D alone, this film is absolutely fabulous and real entertainment and I never tired of it, even if the glasses did end up giving me a headache. So there you have it ? an average film that becomes a fun experience thanks to the three-dimensionality of it alone. Watch it once, but if you want my advice, NEVER see it unless it's in 3D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awesome underrated slasher remake movie in the horror genre!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine 3D (2009) is very underrated horror slasher flick and a remake of the classic original horror film My Bloody Valentine (1981) with the same name. I love this film, this slasher horror film is very bashed from fans and its critics! I have enjoyed this movie very much more than other horror remake Friday the 13th! Before I review this film I want to explain why this horror film grow on me and why I love it so much. In the fall 2009 I saw on TV Supernatural (2005) horror TV series it was the third season on TV, after finishing watching episodes 1 and 2, the series become one of my all time favorite TV shows. I was hooked up on that show after I finished season 3 on TV, I downloaded Season 1 and 2 on my computer and I watch them from the beginning till the end. I loved it, in 2010 I finished seasons 4 and 5. I loved both of the actors who portrayed the Winchester boys and I was interested in their filmography and I noticed both of the actors in the same year of 2009 were playing in a horror slasher remakes the lead protagonists. Jensen Ackles tried with this film My Blood Valentine playing Tom J. Hanniger the main protagonist. While Jared Padalecki tried his portrayal the protagonist Clay Miller in Friday the 13th (2009). I must say both of the actors did a great job in each horror slasher remake movie! I watched both of the movies separately and I loved them. I love Jensen Ackles and I love Jared Padalecki! After watching the first time this film I loved it immediately. I don't care what anyone says I love this film. I did not saw the original film before but even for a remake the bloody violent horror film did a good job on his way. I loved the twist! One of my favorite actors is in this film Tom Atkins (The Fog, Maniac Cop), gosh I loved him in Maniac Cop, the second time my favorite actor dies in the horror genre slasher film! Jansen Ackles didn't die because a lot of us Jansen Ackles fans did not want to see him die. I am happy that director did not killed of his character. It was GREAT to see a horror movie that is not shy about getting gory and violent and nude... and that just has a damn good time with itself, which makes it all that much more fun to watch. Patrick Lussier did a great job as director and editor in this film. All credits goes to him for making such an awesome horror slasher flick. They even did not copy the original film, but making their own story with the different twist on the end. The remake still makes a nice effort to remake a classic horror tale that is worth at least a viewing by any horror fan. The real star of this movie is the 3D effect and while I was skeptical I found this "gimmick" to be much better then I expected on home video. This film kept me on the edge of my seat as I watched the victims get "sliced and diced! This movie earns the title My Blood Valentine because right of the back you got blood and gore everywhere. The original title My Blood Valentine is barely any blood because it was in the 80's, so you couldn't get away with stuff like that. In the 80's where everybody coming down on your ass about that, probably got an X rating, a bit a surprise if they dig X rating, but now days blood and gore are stereotypical to horror movies so at least the title fits to this movie! Better than it did, in the original movie. Surprisingly I am complaining a bit a little about CGI blood, when I am watching it, I can see the CGI blood. Other than that, you got a good blood squibs, pretty good! Than this remake also does what the original did it confuses you to forgot who is actually the killer, is it Axel or certainly someone else? I am not going to say his name, but I like that! They kept that in there as well, cause in the original it didn't go out the way it did. In that movie, you have to pick a choose which one was the killer, because they were two of the men there and they both had a mine suits on. I pick mine but I was wrong It was the other one and I am not going to tell who it was, if you haven't seen the original. This one kind a flips flops, so instead been the guy from the original, it's the other guy. That is cool, that was a nice little switch. Person you think it should, it is not. Another good purpose in this remake. It is a pretty decent remake and I enjoy it much more than the original! How about that? I like it more than the original wow?! The basic plot about this film is: My Bloody Valentine takes place ten years after a devastating coal mining accident when a string of gruesome murders plague a small town. My Bloody Valentine 3D is a 2009 American horror film, and a remake of the 1981 Canadian slasher film of the same name. The film was directed and edited by Patrick Lussier, and stars Jensen Ackles, Jaime King and Kerr Smith. The film had a 3D theatrical release.9/10 Grade: B+ Studio: Lionsgate Starring: Jensen Ackles, Jaime King, Kerr Smith, Kevin Tighe, Tom Atkins Director: Patrick Lussier Producer: Jack L.

		<fullReview>In the mining town of Harmony, an accident buries six miners alive. Mine owner's son Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles) is blamed. Harry Warden survives by killing the other miners with a pickax to save oxygen. He wakes up from a coma on Valentine's Day and starts killing with a pickax. He also attacks teens having a party at the mine. Tom had reluctantly joined his girlfriend Sarah (Jaime King). They, Axel Palmer (Kerr Smith) and his girlfriend Irene (Betsy Rue) survive the attack. Sheriff Burke (Tom Atkins) and his deputy arrive just in time and Harry scrambles back into the mine. Ten years later, Tom returns for his father's funeral and to sell the mine. Axel is now the sheriff and married to Sarah with a son named Noah. He's cheating on her with Megan (Megan Boone). Tom is staying at the local motel where the pickax killer massacres Irene, her trucker sex partner and the midget motel manager. Later in the mine, Tom comes face-to-face with the killer.There are a lot of cheesy 3-D gimmicks coming straight out of the screen. It is reminiscent of the early days of 3-D uses. There is camp value to the way it's done. There is also a functional serial killer mystery in this movie. I wouldn't say this is anything great but it's not half-bad as far as this type of horror goes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bloodier valentine awaits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another bigger, gorier, of the remakes. This one, having beautiful women, probably not as better actors, but it also has attribute, 3D. There's nothing like seeing pick axes fly off ya, or bullets ricocheting off your nose. We remain true to the original story with a couple of differences, one killer wise I think. As stumbling into the movie, ten minutes late, I had already missed some great over excessive gore. This movie delivers heavily on it, where judging by the original, you think to yourself, gees, how times change. It was Wolf Creek that set the new standard in cranked up visual violence. If it's a R rated horror, a high level violence warning is guaranteed. This horror works great as a truly great whodunit, let me tell you, it heightens it's quality. The movie had surpassed my expectations. This one keeps you in an indecision over two people, but then two or three other suspects appear, we're more irresolute, you'd go bonkers wracking your brain. The mine shots are great and claustrophobic. This one too, again marks the return of a couple of older actors, you know, they suddenly pop up, and you think to yourself, you're kidding me. The older Valentine doesn't deserve to be snubbed, as that is particularly good, also, but if you want a more cranked up, exciting version, this is it. In 3D of course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a remake that is worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a long time horror fan I to have always felt that some horror films should never have remakes considering that remakes intend to not live up to the original film. Remakes end up either copying way too much or make changes to the story that just end up not being worth the watch. But when I did see My Bloody Valentine 3D I decided to give the film a watch. Considering that when I saw the DVD in stores I suddenly remembered the long forgotten 1981 original. I will say story wise this film managed to be refreshing. Rather then go down the same tired routine as remakes do of copying origoal films, this film actually managed to interest me with something new. While the characters were the same in a sense, the writers managed to put them in different situations. And I liked how when the backstory was explained that years later of what became of the town. In the original the town always seemed to be happy and cheery even during the knowledge of a Valentines Day killer on the lose or when they know of the killers intentions on Valentines Day or what that kiler did 10 years prior, they were all too happy over Valentines Day and that just annoyed me. In this remake the town is still effected by the terrible events of 10 years prior and I found that to be more interesting. But I also liked how they switched the fates around of Tom Hanniger and Axel Palmer. I wont ruin who the killer is in the film if you haven't seen it but your going to be in for something different when the mystery and killer are revealed. Overall the film is darker and more serious in terms of the original. But to be fair the original was from a different time era of horror films. Now today everything is constantly remade and not original anymore. But this remake I feel surpassed the original 1981 film. Because it tried to be more serious and original and not just do the same tired copying original films and doing the same routine stuff that's been done to death. You don't see remakes doing this at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite good, as slashers go</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised at how much I enjoyed 2009's "My Bloody Valentine" since these types of horror films are a dime a dozen. "My Bloody Valentine" is a remake of a 1981 film, which I've never seen, but it includes most of the vital elements for an effective slasher movie.What I mean by "these types of horror films" are the ones that follow the basic formula so well established by the "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th" franchises -- a crazy masked killer and a group of youths in a specific environment, whether a town, camp, forest, college, resort, building, etc. In this case it's a mining town, shot in Kittanning and Bethel, PA, and points nearby along the Allegheny River (which are my stomping grounds, btw). So the film gets a big plus for filming somewhere other than British Columbia! (Not that there's anything wrong with BC, of course, but enough is enough).Beautiful women is a must for these types of films and "My Bloody Valentine" delivers superbly with Jaime King, Megan Boone and Betsy Rue, the latter in an extended nude scene, which I think is unnecessary, but some might appreciate it.Most importantly, the story keeps your attention and also keeps you guessing as to the identity of the killer till the very end. Great job on this front.The film runs 101 minutes.GRADE: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid good no-brainer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this when it came out and I was pleasantly surprised. I'd say this falls in the better one of the new wake of remakes 1998 and on. The premise and plot line aren't smarter or less contrived than other offerings in the genre, but My bloody valentine makes up in every other department: the pace is tight, the characters are good (played a bit better and in just a bit more fleshed-out characters than usual), anchoring performances by seasoned actors are good (Tom Atkins &amp; Kevin Tighe), script with its twist is good (Todd Farmer had better luck with this one than with his own "Hatchet") and the whole movie knows better than to take itself fully seriously. Also 3-D is really taken advantage of with this one. Here you get kicks out of it about two thirds out of way, while in Tron 3D, Saw 7 3D and the last two Final destinations you really get about one third. So, highly recommended - no, but recommended - yes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the way this starts off in the B-vein, with it's dodgy dialogue, costume etc &amp; having only seen Jensen Ackles (Hanninger) previously in excellent TV serial 'Supernatural' I at first started thinking oh dear, but after the 1st few scenes became pleasantly surprised. As the plot unfolds, not only does the Acting seem to improve, the whole quality does &amp; a storyline with intelligence actually does develop. The Slasher Gimp scenes incidentally are quite good throughout, there are also some funny one's. This will probably appeal to, but not impress Old School 'Friday 13th'/'Halloween' lovers. 'My Bloody Valentine' is a Film you need to give a chance. Good breakthrough for Ackles. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Severely Mediocre Remake Of One Of The Finest The 80's Has To Offer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original MBV is one of my favorite horror films, so I had rather lofty hopes for the remake. And while not, awful it's certainly not very good.MBV is one of THOSE kinds of slashers. The ones with a big-budget, terrible acting and an un-scary killer. It mediocre but slightly enjoyable. However not anything I'll ever view again.Directed by the awful Patrick Lussier (whom we can thank for 2000's Dracula 2000) MBV is surprisingly badly acted for having such a big budget. It's like all the actors and actresses have boils on their tongues and it's hard for them to talk. The 3D is pretty cool, but nothing more than a little gimmick that hurts your eyes. No too mention the awful dialouge and horrific nude scene. (Sorry, I ain't a nude loving prick like most male-horror fans.)However things ramp up towards the end and the movie almost becomes good. I have to admit the twist is also handled better than in the 80's original as well.I can't bring myself to give MBV a bad score. But I don't really like it either. If you're a slasher fan like me, give both versions a watch. You'll see what I mean. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic acting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the worse acting i've ever seen to be completely honest. Jensen Ackles is the only person who can actually act average in this film. The movie is somewhat entertaining though with a lot of blood and gore which is good. Effects are alright, nothing too amazing, some of the violent scenes look quite realistic while others just look like a very very low budget film. The story line definitely lacks A LOT of depth. The audience is left sort of guessing what happened in the past and why this whole slaughtering thing is going on. Basically just an excuse to have a guy in a gas mask going around killing people with an axe. If you want to see lots of blood and quite a comedic act when it comes to some of the murders, then you will enjoy this slasher film, otherwise I would not bother as nothing new in the horror genre occurs and everything is just plain stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much obviously inspired by "TCM" and "Urban Legend" franchises, My Bloody Valentine (3D or not) is a story about a mysterious serial killer that is only found out in the end. I agree with many people that stated this is full of clichés; stumbling while running away, manipulative plot that wants to make you think who is the killer, along with some inaccuracies. For instance, how could Tom be the lunatic once he's seen fighting with the masked killer two times? Was he fighting against himself? The only good things about this movie is that it entertains and don't let you know who is the killer until the very end; I myself found more probable to be Axel than Tom, so it kinda surprised me. No second watching anyways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Bloody Valentine:the 2009 (2D) version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having enjoyed George Mihalkas strangely pretty classy 1981 original,I was very interested in seeing how the film would be updated for the extreme-gore era of horror. (although due to having a "normal" TV,I decided to not watch the film in 3D,but instead to watch the "normal 2D" version)To my complete surprise,this film kept the spirit of the original very strong,whilst giving the story and the characters a surprising amount of depth.The plot:In the small mining town of Harmony,everyone is terrified when an explosion causes a group of miners to get stuck in the mines.As they start to dig for the bodies of the miners,to everyones relief they discover that one of the miners (Harry Warden) is still alive (although he is in a coma.)During his time in the hospital,some autopsy reports get release which show that the miners, did not die from the cave- in,but they had actually died from someone killing each of them with a pick axe.With the police thinking that there is no chance that Harry is going to come out of his coma,they decide to keep him in the local hospital.To everyones complete surprise Harry eventually comes out of the coma,and goes on a killing spree to make sure that everyone in the town remembers this Valentines Day (Harry does this by ripping out the heart of the murder victim,and putting each of them into "candy" Valentines Day boxes.) When the cops at last get to Harry,they shoot him and decide that they should bury his body deep in the woods,so that no one else in the town knows where the body of Harry is... 10 years later...With the passing of time,the residents of Harmony decide that instead of keeping Valentines Day in the shadow,they should instead celebrate it.As the celebrations start to gain momentum,the son of Harry Warden (Tom ) returns in town.Tom announces that he has returned to Harmony,to sell off the mines (Tom inherited his 55% stake in the mines from his father Harry).Due to the mines being the main source of income in the city,all the residents are understandably very angry about this plan,one of the residents who has a huge amount of mixed feelings about this,is the local police officer Axel Palmer,who used to be a pretty good friend of Toms,although since he has left,Palmer has marred and started a family with Toms former girlfriend Sarah.Whilst Axel starts to think about the effects of Toms return on him and his wife and child,he gets a huge wake-up call.that someone is trying to revive the dark past of the town,when the police station receives an anonymous Valentines candy box,that is dripping with blood..View on the film:From the first half an hour of the film,to the very end I was shocked at how well written the screenplay was.One of the very smart things that screenwriters Zane Smith and Todd Farmer (who has a fun cameo appearance in the film )did was to give the slasher/horror moments in the film a strong foundation to be built upon,by making one of the main plot lines be about how the small community, could be about to get destroyed by the selling off of its mines,which even without the very enjoyable horror elements of the film,would have made the film into a pretty enjoyable drama.Whilst his previous work is filled with mostly disappointing direct-to- Video/DVD sequels, (although he did amazingly well with his editing on the first,and best Scream film.)director Patrick Lussier does an excellent job at making this film hugely enjoyable.Despite the last 30 minutes of the film sadly featuring less action in the mines than there was in the original,Lussier completely caught me by surprise,by including some fun small nods to the original,whilst making all of the excellent killings pop in a very fresh style.Although most directors would have had the main characters in the film be a bunch of drunk teenagers,Patrick takes a rather fresh approach of having the characters, instead be people in there late twenties,who are actually pretty mature and are all starting to settle down in there lives.Final view on the film:An extremely enjoyable slasher film well directed, with a clever screenplay,a very good cast,and some fantastic killings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Gory &amp; Brutal Horror Remake which for some reason is likable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well in the year 2009 we got two slashers being remade which was Friday the 13th &amp; this. Friday was a bit of a disappointment as it had no suspense and just plain kills which were decent, but this, this does a lot for me.Even if I liked the original a bit more than this, I can't say that this was that bad. This has spoilers and those (who have seen the original only) who haven't seen this film should not read the rest of my review.- Some of the scenes are a little bit different as we have different turns and clichés to the story.- The kills are all well done (even if I'm not a gore for gore fan) but they were done well. even if I liked them, the original's deaths dominate. Sorry.- The story has a bit more mystery to it which is good because we don't want to see a carbon copy of the original (like day of the dick did) - Acting is up to scratch in some areas.Overall it intense and who ever was playing Harry Warden did an amazing job. I think it was Jenson Ackles.Anyway 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is just way too many horror flicks that is better than this, isn't uber terrible though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the first 3D horror flick I seen, and to my surprise it wasn't at terrible as I thought it would be. The whole movie comes down to how many different ways to kill people with a pickaxe. The 3D I guess in this is alright and for some that really enjoy seeing nudity in movies, there is a full frontal nudity scene in this. The script isn't anything great and there really isn't much tension or scares in this. The main thing that drives this movie is to figure out what is going on and who the killer is, although it's still mostly predictable. And the 3D is basically the only thing going for it besides figuring out who the killer is. It's basically below average slasher movie, I heard the older version is pretty good but watching this movie sort of turned me off from seeing the original. But maybe I will check it out someday, anyways besides the 3D which isn't all that good this movie is mostly a waste of time. For the audiences that don't know much about horror elements I guess might sort of enjoy this, but for horror buffs this is a pass. There is plenty of better horror movies out there than this.5.2/10</fullReview>

The 3-D added a lot of "OOH and AHH" moments and a few jumps but the glasses got annoying... Put that aside and you have a pretty great horror movie. Some twists and a lot of great kill scenes. Some may make you turn in disgust but they aren't that bad in general. This movie was fun to share with others and the story was easy to follow and the characters were iffy but good. This is a fun movie to watch and still enjoyable at the same time. All in all I loved this movie. I give "My Bloody Valentine" an 8 out of 10.~Joe</fullReview>

Now I'm kicking myself and wishing I had watched it sooner.Loved Jensen Ackles, loved Jamie King, liked Kerr Smith. Lots of gore, lots of scary moments and screaming, but the ending was what did it for me. I sat there with my mouth open, I never saw that coming, I saw other scenarios in my mind, but not the one that played out. Maybe I don't watch enough slasher films anymore? I just recommended it today to a friend who likes horror stuff and I don't do that with a lot of horror flicks because they all seem the same anymore. I really wish I had gone and seen it in the theater in 3D. And, in the special features, I would have loved an alternate ending where the other possible one would have been the one who did it.

		<shortDescription>Imperfect but fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie, to be honest. I'm not typically a fan of gore, but My Bloody Valentine just might make me willing to indulge in more slasher flicks. It was fun, entertaining, and exciting without being too dark.The plot line was far better than expected, and at times, even delved into some appropriate complexity. My Bloody Valentine's strong suit is that it never takes itself seriously. It was a film created to entertain. This isn't The Silence of the Lambs, and it never claims to be.That being said, there are significant problems. It was overtly predictable (maybe on purpose) and I really wanted to tear my hair out at the end. The subtle complexity became overworked near the end, and then decayed into total confusion. The so-called "intelligent twist" was one of the oldest tricks in the book, and unbelievable to the point of idiocy. As I mentioned before, My Bloody Valentine is not meant to be a serious movie. However, I was incredibly disappointed with the ending, because this movie is almost perfect.Despite the disappointing final act, My Bloody Valentine is worth watching. Don't go into it expecting something Oscar-worthy, but let yourself have fun with it. Because despite its imperfections, My Bloody Valentine certainly succeeds in being entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than most without the 3D gimmicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on George Mihalka's 1981 slasher and Stephen A. Miller's story of the of the same name; a killer miner returns to a small town on the 10th anniversary of his killing spree to pick-axe the ones that got away but, is it really him?What starts out as a teen-like slasher,such as Prom Night/Friday 13th,this quickly feels more grounded when the story moves 10 years on. There's lots of gore and the killings are bloody and have been executed with some great effects. My Bloody Valentine is an above average stalker type gore slasher. The acting is a mixed bag of impressive performances by Kerr Smith and Jaime King, however, Supernatural's lead Jensen Ackles is mediocre.This remake doesn't need the 3D gimmicks which actually spoil a few great moments of escapism, with it's lingering close shots that cheapen the look of Brian Pearson's cinematography. What makes this better than most is the 1981 whodunit story and Todd Farmer and Zane Smith's updated screenplay that sticks to the original, it's little twists, the characters and the relationships are well written and explored. There's plenty of drive and motivation even in the sub character's including Tom Atkins and Kevin Tighe. Overall, despite My Bloody Valentine's faults it is surprisingly good due to the storytelling and satisfying conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The town of Harmony tries to forgot its disturbing past. Ten years ago, after a tragic miming accident. Harry Warden (Richard John Waters) survived the accident but he has killed five mens with a pick-axe to survive. Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles) is blamed for the mining disaster, because he didn't do his job by the book. Harry Warden goes on a deep coma until he is awaking with vengeance and he kills anyone in sight, especially in the mines. Since he got to kill an group of teenagers were partying in the mines.Now Tom is trying to sell his shares of the mines, since his father originally owned it. The town people of Harmony would like to believe that Harry Warden is dead. When valentine's day is approaching, it seems that Harry is back in town and killing those were part of the accident and buried the evidence. Axel (Kerr Smith) and his wife Sarah were part of the party killing massacre, who survived. Now Axel is a police deputy of the town. When one of the survivors Irene (Besty Rue), who survived the party killing massacre got murdered in a run-down motel. Tom might be suspected of these brutal new killings. Although Tom and Axel are not what they seemed to be.Directed by Patrick Lussier (The "Dracula 2000" trilogy, White Noise 2, Drive Angry) made an entertaining slasher, suspenseful thriller movie. Although well shot in 3-D. Lussier gives some knowing homage to the notorious original classic. The cast are good here, some fine suspense amusing thrills and some great murder sequences. Die-Hard fans of the original will probably won't be surprise by the conclusion of the film.The Blu-ray has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) 1080P transfer and an superb DTS 7.1 HD Surround Sound. The Blu-ray includes an enjoyable running commentary track by the director and co-writer:Tood Farmer (Jason X, The Messengers, The Messengers 2:The Scarecrow), two featurettes, deleted scenes, gag reel, alternate ending and the original theatrical trailer. "My Bloody Valentine" is a pretty good remake with better than expected performances (especially veterans pros like Kevin Tighe and cult favorite:Tom Atkins in supporting roles) and some nice homages to the original. The only real flaw in the remake is the ending, it is less than satisfying. "My Bloody Valentine" is a perfect viewing in the Halloween season or better yet, during Valentine's Day. It is worth a look. (*** ?/*****).</fullReview>

And it is definitely good for the older teens to watch.The original MBV was a great horror but in my opinion, this is much better, Harry Warden, a deranged coal miner wants revenge and this film, shows all the revenge you could possibly think off. The deaths are totally unrealistic but it still is a great, horror flick what will have you on the edge of your seat, tucked underneath somebody's coat.

		<fullReview>Obviously this movie was made for 3D but unfortunately I only saw the 2D version and there's nothing that particularly stands out about 'My Bloody Valentine'. It's pretty much your usual B-grade slasher. It follows all the usual formula. The special effects are quite bad (at last on 2D). There's plenty of gratuitous nudity and torture. The slasher scenes are funny to watch (which was clearly the director's intention). The acting is predictably bad but then again there wasn't much the actors could have done given the abysmal writing. However, Jaime King fairs better (which is no surprise since she's a much better actor than Jensen Ackles and Kerr Smith). I wasn't expecting much from the 'My Bloody Valentine' to begin with but I think it's a mistake to not watch it in 3D, unless one likes watching the usual recycled slasher trash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See it in theatres in 3D, otherwise, you can skip it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's seldom these days I bother making the trek to theatres to see new releases. I've just had one too many bad experiences to be arsed handing over my not-so-hard earned cash to have most of the audience wreck my head throughout the movie. With home theatre systems being so cheap and accessible for the average Joe, I expect I ain't the only one abandoning the red sticky carpet and overpriced popcorn for the comfort of scaring the crap outta yourself in your own living room. However, some film's demand to be seen in a cinema, for either one of two reasons. One, it's a crowd movie that wouldn't be the same on your own, or two, it's technical aspects, i.e, a 3D process that you will not be able to experience at home. And funnily enough, My Bloody Valentine 3D falls into both of these categories.In terms of plot line, not a huge amount has changed from the original. In case you didn't know, this is a remake of the semi classic film of the same title from the golden age of slashers, 1981. Crazy mentalist Harry Warden escapes from a coma after he was trapped in a collapsed mine and forced to kill the others in order to survive. He returns to the scene of the massacre only to go on a new killing spree, hacking up teens having a keg party with a pick axe. After the sheriff (Tom 'thrill me' Aktins) blows the madman to hell and buries him in the collapsing mine, things look set to return to normal.Cut to ten years later, and everyone has tried to move on with their lives. That is, until the killings start up again. Who is shedding all this blood? Is it Tom (Jensen Ackles, of the impressive TV show, Supernatural), who has just shown back up to the town since the massacre to sell the mine? Or is it the new young sheriff Axel (Kerr Smith) who looks shifty and is definitely boning a teenage girl behind his pretty wife's back? Or is it ten other potential red herrings that film points a finger at throughout? Who cares. the story is fairly flimsy, and it really falls apart in the last half. The acting is also hit and miss, and to be honest, you probably won't really care what is happening by the 60 minute mark. In fact, if it wasn't for the 3D aspects, I would be calling this an awful pile of crap. However......The 3D really rocks. Plain and simple. This is the first film I have seen that is a live action 3D, and the new process is fantastic. It really puts you into the film and enhances the experience by 300%. Pick axes, eyeballs, guns, and anything that can move towards the screen hits you like a bag of hammers every couple of minutes, and is thoroughly entertaining. Even moments like when the camera peers into the hollowed out chest of a murdered victim, the way it looks is giddily nauseating. The filmmakers clearly knew that they were making another crud slasher film, but knew that the sale lies in the presentation. Which leads me to one conclusion, this film is gonna bomb on DVD. Without the 3D process, this film is pretty much worthless. It will probably then fall into the same category as the Black Christmas remake.That aside, it's worth handing over your money to see it. For once, I didn't mind all the screaming and shouting in the cinema, as I knew the film was garbage, but the entertainment factor was still there. Oh, did I mention that we also get about 5 minutes of solid full frontal female nudity? And a midget getting killed? And lot's of gore? Enough said.</fullReview>

So the basic story is: A group of men get trapped in a mine and one Harry Warden kills all of them and ends up in a coma. he then wakes up and kills a lot of people in the hospital and in the mine where kids are partying. harry is killed by the sheriff and the only survivors are 4 kids; Tom Hanniger, Sarah, Axel and Irene then 10 years later tom return to his hometown and suddenly there's a killer on the loose who is just like Harry Warden. but he's dead right?I think this movie had a lot of good stuff and bad stuff. I think it was cool how they balanced between the supernatural and the non-supernatural solution about the killer for a while before it was clear that the killer is a human. you were going back and forth with "is it Harry Warden? Is it Axel? Is it Tom? Is it someone else?" and they kept the secret well, you really couldn't tell who the killer was because there were so many motives for the suspects. and the beginning was really great.but the movie wasn't great. the kills were a little boring and they didn't make you jump or throw up. the 3D version was cool but the image was kind of blurred throughout the film except for the scenes where there really something coming to your face. and the nudity. this didn't have it that much but it was kinda pointless. I find myself comparing this to the new Friday the 13th. I liked both films, but I think F13 did a better job. this movie felt sort of loose. the kills on F13 made me really go like "eww, that's gross" and somehow this didn't do it, it was just boring. and the nudity seemed more logical in F13 considering Jason's history etc. the sex scene in this one was just like "erm, what?!" but the 3D version was really cool, when you really had a bullet coming towards you. I think 3D can make horror films really scary again. so, what's the point in this? pretty good movie, but not great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, of its kind - 3D good though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So there's this miner who slaughters loads of people before the mine caves in and kills him. Ten years later, the slaughter starts again...No surprises here, just the usual quota of grisly slaughter (some inventive, most involving a pickaxe), a modicum of nudity, a guessing game as to whether it's him back again or someone else (and, if so, who), and people idiotically behaving in the most improbable ways conceivable so as to be slaughtered more easily.The 3D is interesting for several reasons. These don't include objects flying at the camera, of which this movie contains more than its fair share. No, more interesting is considering what works in 3D and what doesn't, and how increased use of 3D means that some elements of film grammar which have remained essentially unchanged for 100 years will now have to be reworked somewhat.The most effective 3D shots, to me at any rate, involved set ups with several different distances from the camera (multiplane, if you will), and some sort of movement between those planes. Sometimes this was physical movement: more effective than this was pulling focus, especially when the intermediate plane was, for instance, a glass door with some sort of tracery in the glass. There was also a point when the infamous Jaws shot(zoom in and simultaneous dolly out) was done - extremely effective in 3D. Conversely, there were a number of shots where the subject of the shot was in the middle distance, but an out of focus foreground element (which would have been barely noticeable in 2D) fatally distracts the attention. Look and learn, I say.The opening titles, by the way, are stunningly effective in 3D. The film delivers what you're after if you're a fan of slasher/slaughter movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go for the 3D and Gore. The movie isn't that good though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The gore and nudity were very strong. This movie went for a hard R. The 3-D effects were done extremely well. The movie was o.k., but nothing special. The other positive was they did develop the three main characters some and they were not 21 years old like most slashers.This is a film that can only be effective on the big screen. This is one I don't see any reason to revisit after it comes out on DVD. I thought the ending was too cliché and predictable.Overall, it is good theater experience for the excessive gore and 3-D. It is worth a trip to the theater for that aspect. I was disappointed in the story and honestly was just ready for the damn thing to end. I give the movie a 4/10 and the effects an 8/10. My overall score is a 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Years ago, a mine collapse took the lives of dozens of men. What was thought to be an accident is revealed, however, to have been a murderous rampage by an insane miner named Harry Warden. When Warden, left in a coma for years after, escapes from the local hospital (murdering a whole load there as well) and returns to the town of Harmony, PA, murder follows in tow. With the help of the local police, Warden is stopped (or thought to be) and the town sits peaceful once more. That is, until Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles) returns to town for the first time in a decade getting ready to sell the mines he inherited from his father. Bodies begin to pile up as an insane miner wanders town, 'pick'ing off people one by one. Is Harry Warden really dead? Or has he returned to continue his vengeance on the town that drove him to murder?Over the past few years, films like 'House of 1000 Corpses,' 'Gutterballs,' and many others have made the throwback to 'better' days of horror. 'My Bloody Valentine 3D' has followed that trend. With all the over-the-top gore, nudity, language, partying, and bad acting of the '80s slashers we all love, this '3D ride to hell' is one hell of a run ride! To start, the story does what I believe all good remakes should. It keeps the basic outline (insane miner kills people out of revenge), but twists it enough to make it its own film. The acting was a bit, well, bad for much of the film, but it wasn't distracting enough to put the viewer off the movie. . . especially if they remember they're watching something called 'My Bloody Valentine 3D.' Past the writing &amp; acting, what really shines in this film is Patrick Lussier's direction and Brian Pearson's cinematography. Lussier, whose previous projects were almost entirely sequels ranging from awful to just mediocre, does a very good job with his second theatrical debut (his first being the also-fun 'Dracula 2000' with Gerard Butler). Pearson, who worked with Lussier on 'White Noise 2: The Light' (meh) and with Jensen Ackles on 'Devour' (boo), delivered his best work yet here utilizing some fun shots to take advantage of the 3D effects. Pearson did have his work cut out for him, to be honest, since it's fairly difficult to work 3D without it being TOO cheesy. Also, the look has to translate back into 2D since most TVs aren't capable of doing 3D. He succeeds in the first point, but I'm not too sure about the 2D translation since I didn't see it. . . but I think he did well there as well. As far as horror elements go, there were plenty of fun jump scares, though the attempts at 'Halloween'-esque spook-outs didn't really work well. The Miner wasn't nearly imposing or creepy as Michael Myers when he was cocking his head curiously at his victims. Regardless, it did work well as a 'popcorn scare' flick, which is exactly what it needed to be. If you're looking for a deep, thoughtful horror that will challenge the mind, just pass on by: This isn't for you. But, if you are in the mood to bring your sweetie to the latest Hollywood horror hit and don't want to waste your time with lame PG-13 garbage, I highly recommend 'My Bloody Valentine 3D': They don't make 'em like this anymore. Except they do, clearly. . .Final verdict: 7/10. Maybe it's a sign of better days for Hollywood horror? -AP3-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basically, that sums it up. I felt Jensen was Dean AGAIN! Which doesn't speak well to his acting ability. But there is one difference between this and Supernatural, the writing in this is Terrible. Outstanding, we keep the character, but lose all the smarts and symbolism of the TV show. Thanks Valentine, was beginning to be warmed over by memories of a TV show that does what this film tries to do better. A TV SHOW!!! ON THE CW!!! SHOT IN CANADA!!! Really Jensen, what were you thinking? I know this most have been a easy job, you didn't even need to change your costume, but really poor effort here. Not to put it all on him, but he could have picked a better project then this poorly written, poorly producted remake. So to sum up, skip this and buy SUPERNATURAL SEASON 1-4 on DVD!

Instead of a homecoming, however, Tom finds himself suspected of committing the murders, and it seems like his old flame is the only one will believes he's innocent.I did enjoy the movie but mostly the 3D effect which i thought was amazing and the plot was good, acting was good also deaths were good too.Great movie 8/10, 3D Effect 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very entertaining experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine (1981) was one of the best rehashes of Friday the 13th and Halloween (1978) which came out in the 80's.That film had obtained a very solid combination between the grotesque scenes of violence from the first one and the party "gimmick" from the second one,but focusing on St. Valentine's Day instead of Halloween.Now, 28 years later, we have the very entertaining remake of that movie, offering us black humor and gory violence...in 3D.The screenplay from My Bloody Valentine (2009) is much more ambitious and interesting than the average slasher movie and although it loosed the focus on a few occasions,it brings some substance to the long chain of murders.The actors are very well adapted to the style from the movie and the movie has a frenetic rhythm which does not loose any time on showing us a great deal of violence,at the same time it has a sex scene which culminates on a simultaneously hilarious and disturbing sequence.On this film, we can expect aspects every movie made on 3D has, like objects flying to the spectators or elements which seem to go through the screen.Fortunately, My Bloody Valentine (2009) uses the system of alternating polarization which was perfected by the company RealD, instead of the hateful and very poor anaglyph system.To be brief, I will mention that the technique works very well on this film, because it definitely adds a lot of impact to it.Editor Patrick Lussier trained his director office on the world of straight-to-DVD sequels, and with crappy films on his filmography like Dracula II: Ascencion or White Noise: The Light, my expectations for this remake were very low.However, I took a very nice surprise with this movie, and Lussier shows that when he works with a solid screenplay, his work can be very competent.It is undoubtedly far away from being a great movie, but I really appreciated to see the 3D technique was endorsed by a competent screenplay, cast and direction, so I recommend this movie with confidence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Bloody Valentine A Decent Horror Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine is a decent horror remake in a long line of films being re-imagined these days including Friday the 13th, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and The Hills Have Eyes to name a few. The cast of young stars are admirable in their roles including Jensen Ackles (from Supernatural and Smallville), Jamie King (from Sin City And The Spirit), and Kerr Smith (from Dawson's Creek and Final Destination). The rest of the relatively unknown cast turn in above average performances considering some movies of this genre seem to chose spectacle over acting which is never the wisest choice. The director does a good job at keeping the story moving at a steady pace with some character development while giving audiences everything they could expect from these type of films which includes blood, guts, brutal realistic deaths, and some suspense as to the identity of the killer. At least for most of the film I wasn't quite sure who the killer was until near the end when it became kind of obvious. Parents should be warned that this film has strong graphic horror violence throughout, a steamy sex scene, full frontal nudity (a girl), and strong language so this is no movie to take your kids to see at least not until their eighteen. Besides some flaws with the dialgoue at times and the sort of predictable twist ending which reveals the identity of the killer. My Bloody Valentine is an above average horror movie with some suspense, solid acting for the most part, and plenty of sick gruesome deaths that sure to please any fan of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Bloody Valentine 3D gets 10 stars!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jensen Ackles was amazing. He actually broke out of his Dean Winchester role from Supernatural and took on a different and well rounded character albeit mentally disturbed. Kerr Smith did a nice job as well as the cop with a secret to hide. By the end of the movie I wasn't sure if it was Kerr Smith or Jensen Ackles who was the real killer. There's a moment in the end where you start to think that it's someone totally different and then boom, the big surprise. No way I'm telling you. I loved the 3D effects. They are amazing. The technology has come a long way! This movie has earned I've heard an estimated 35 million so far and I think that's great as far as horror films are concerned. It certainly would beat out Friday the 13th in storyline quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a huge fan of slasher flicks, but this movie was good...the storyline was a little vague, but the acting held it together. Some of the gory scenes were hilarious, that could be because I didn't watch it in 3D-I get headaches when I watch 3D movies. Other gory scenes were gross but still not too bad for me to watch.Now, I'm a major fan of Supernatural on CW, and a big fan of Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki...so I decided to see what their other works are like, so far I haven't been disappointed. Jensen's character in this movie is very convincing, as well as Kerr Smith's. I also enjoyed Jaime King's performance...but I think her character was a bit wishy-washy at the end-the script-not her performance.Betsy Rue was frickin' hilarious, even when her scene turned scary. This girl has guts for what she did, and she did it well. I'm sure the guys enjoyed her scenes immensely.Definitely not for kids...in fact I told my 9 year old that he couldn't watch it until he turned 18.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A valentine to horror fans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A psychotic killer in miner's garb who may or may not have died a decade ago returns to haunt the small, slightly incestuous community of Harmony on Valentine's Day. Armed with a pick-axe, our killer finds many clever and efficient ways of dispatching his victims which include quite possibly the first little-person ever to be splattered in a horror movie.Few remakes nowadays are done with the kind of love and respect that 1981's Canadian cult classic "My Bloody Valentine" has received. As a 3-D upgrade, it's almost like a valentine itself to horror fans, being throwback to the 80's glory days of the slasher genre that it is. With all the over-the-top violence you'd expect from a 3-D horror flick, the film also gets by with a touch of style from director Patrick Lussier ("Dracula 2000") as well as a script from Todd Farmer ("Jason X") and Zane Smith that successfully updates but doesn't manipulate its source material.The only weakness to be found is in the 3-D aspect, which is limited, to be honest. While a better effort is made here to ensure that it's not just a useless gimmick like in "Friday the 13th 3D" or the final sequence in "Freddy's Dead," the novelty wears off after a while, and when it's not giving you the funhouse horror thrills you crave, it'll just make your eyes hurt and distract from the pure slasher delight at hand. In all honesty, the film works just as well without the 3-D (thankfully, the DVD/Blu-Ray releases include a 2-D version as well). "My Bloody Valentine" is simply an efficient and crowd-pleasing remake that will no doubt thrill the young audience it was designed for, but the older one as well, who remembers and cherishes the original and other films like it.</fullReview>

The mine collapses, burying six miners alive. The rescue team finds only Harry Warden alive, but he is in coma, and the other miners murdered by his pickax, they find out that Harry killed them to save oxygen for himself. On Valentine's Day, Harry awakes from his coma and he kills twenty-two people, including a group of teenagers that are partying in the mine. Harry is killed by the deputy, but the only survivors are Tom Hanniger, his girlfriend Sarah, their friend Axel Palmer and his girlfriend Irene.

		<fullReview>Well, what can I say? I've just watched this movie and really it's quite bad. It's a typical terror movie: young boys and hot girls having a party in the middle of nowhere, a sadist freak hunting them, sex, nudity.... and a lot of blood.But that's not all. There are some truly horrible mistakes throughout the entire movie, like for example that scene near the end when we know that this guy Tom is the killer and makes a flashback to the scene when he was looking for Ben down in the mine and he was killing the other guy who was with him as the same time that he was locked up in a cage... how can that be? Also when Sarah was in the car with Tom and she pushes him towards the window, making him lost control of the vehicle and crashes into a tree, at the time when an "entire perfectly horizontal branch", which was also pointing towards a curve on the highway, smashes into the car by entering through the front windshield... may I ask how many times did you see a horizontal tree branch pointing to a curve in the route? Well, and like these there are many others. Oh, one thing more. Please, if you still have some time and money to waste and want to go to see it, go to a 3D cinema, at least it will be more entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of the original, I had my doubts about how this one would turn out. And to my surprise, this movie rocked, wow. From the very opening moment before the movie starts just telling you to put on your 3D glasses, I was amazed with what I was seeing. I was blown away from start to finish. I didn't even know a viewing experience like this was possible.Here's a few 3D moments that just amazed me. There's one scene where one of the older local residents behind the killing of Harry Warden is awaken by something in the middle of the night, so he grabs his gun and goes outside to look around. And while he's out there searching for Harry, we get a close up of the shotgun and he waves it front of the camera, you could actually see down the barrel of it. Many of the deaths we get glimpses of the corpses which really looked great, like when the babysitter is revealed to be in the dryer. Really loved that scene, great throwback to the original. The one scene which most have seen already in the trailer where the pick axe is being thrown looks phenomenal. I think I might have even ducked out of the way because I seriously thought it was going to hit me. Even something simple as a hot naked chick throwing a gun at some truckers head turned out great.YES! This naked chick I speak of. Well, there's a short sex scene with her and the biker I mentioned above. Then after finishing up, the biker gets changed and grabs his camera that was filming the whole thing (that bastard!) then he exits the room and begins to to walk back to his truck. This naked chick flips out, grabs her gun and heads out to the parking lot after him. He knows the guns unloaded so she chucks it at him, then our masked killer pops out, slams his pick axe through the bikers melon and then proceeds to chase the girl. He follows her in to the hotel lobby, but with her quick thinking, she decides to hide under a bed(nice). Shortly after the killer hears her make a noise, so he rips off the mattress and sees her just laying under the bed cage. Then after a few missed shots with the pickaxe (each time it's flying out of the screen at you) he finally hits his target. Oh yea, did I mention throughout that entire sequence, the chick is naked.The story was decent, took the basic premise of the original and changed some things around such as adding some extra action scenes, and throwing in a few twists here and there. There's really only thing that I have a problem with, I felt the back story which is shown at the beginning was way too rushed. It's like they just wanted to get the Valentine's Day Massacre out of the way, and move on to the other part of the movie which takes place 10 year later. The intro to this movie definitely should have been stretched out a bit more. When an incident like the one that happens takes place, its more effective if we know the characters a bit more that are involved. Especially since the rest of the movie revolves around that incident. Take the movie 'It' for example, don't you think it would have taken away from the quality of that film if the first half where they're kids was cut down to 10 minutes, I know I do. Honestly, that's really my only complaint.I felt all the actors did an exceptional job in this one. Being a fan of Supernatural, it was great to see Jensen Ackles take on the lead of a horror film. Also, you can't go wrong the gorgeous Jamie King, she is absolutely stunning, I must say. Kerr Smith(Final Destination) also puts in a solid performance as Axel Palmer. A pretty good cast all around.Being a horror fan, I was more then happy with the kills and gore. There's one scene where the killer throws his pickaxe through Tom Atkins lower jaw (the camera moves around and it actually looks like the axe is stuck beneath your chin), kicks his chest and completely tears it off with the jaw coming flying out of the screen, blood everywhere. There's plenty of pick axes through torso's and skulls, it's really great.As for the twist at the end, yes, it may have been used before, but that doesn't make it any less effective. I thought it worked great, and I loved seeing our so-called hero revealed as our masked killer. They took a risk switching it up from the original, and I feel it paid off. Soon after a little scuffle between Tom and Axel while Jamie King's character has them at gun point, she shoots at Tom and we're given a great slow motion close up of the bullet being fired and piercing through his side causing an explosion. Then we're shown a little while after the explosion, that Tom survived the explosion when he kills someone trying to rescue any survivors. But that's not it, we're then treated to another final scene of Tom making a nice escape out of the mines by putting on the rescuers gear/mask, and just walking his way out of there in front of tons of police, locals and firemen.This movie was really a viewing experience like no other, I wish I could see every movie in 3D. Also, this is one movie I would love to see a sequel made to, because I just need to see more. Whether you're a fan of the original or just a horror fan in general, give this one a look, I promise you will not be disappointed.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>10 Years ago, a series of brutal horrific crimes have been committed in the town of Harmony on Valentine's Day and a mine worker named Harry Warden (Richard John Walters) was left for dead in a accident. He came back as a mass murderer but was killed by the local cops including former Sheriff Burke (Tom Atkins), the holiday now returns to Harmony as the town is now safe again after those murders. Tom (Jenson Ackles) was a former resident that has returned back to town after 10 years but when ghastly clues including human hearts in candy boxes are found especially bizarre murders everywhere including the local mines, but is Harry Warden back from the dead or is someone following in his footsteps?A fantastic reimagining of a cult 1981 Canadian slasher classic is very faithful to the original. Co-starring Sexy Betsy Rue, Kerr Smith, and Todd Farmer this 3D horror event lives up to it's title for i love how they modernize the classic horror tale for a new generation but done in amazing 3D which is better at the theater but still the Blu-Ray and DVD versions has both 3D and 2D versions. The film has a retro feel of those glorious 70's and 80's horror movies in a good way including a self-referential sense of humor (ala "Scream") and the violence/gore in this movie is just as brutal as the one in the original but gorier. The acting is quite good even by Tom Atkins who is a 80's horror movie god, this is pure great fun for every horror fan but make sure to experience it in 3D.</fullReview>

Its a typical horror slasher movie: not scary at all, it doesn't have any meaning, its just fun as hell! The user rating of 5.9 is pretty low. Yes, many people don't like this genre, thats why the rating is so low, but others do like slasher movies. I watched all of the great classic slashers and this one isn't bad at all. Its far above average.So if you're a fan of slashers, I highly recommend this movie. But if you don't like the genre, don't say this movie is bad, its just not you're type.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...the worst movie I saw this year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand that this is a slasher, and that it was mostly focused on the 3D part of entertainment. But that's where the entertainment abruptly ends. Starting from an awful scenario, to the line up of the worst horror clichés, this has to be the worst movie I saw this year. The protagonists trip and fall on every other step, even if they're running on a smooth terrain without obstacles. The killer is unstoppable, just like Jason or Mike Myers, which is kinda OK, cause it brings the classical horror mood back... but just for a short while. The very beginning is bloody, and the neat slashing tricks with a pickaxe are the only things that are kinda cool. Oh yeah, and I like the miner suit with the mask. But the movie is very predictable. I just dislike movies in which I know who the killer is at the very beginning. I mean, come on... You give us that huge hint which we cannot miss, and then you try to rap it up in a mystery which simply fails. I like to guess who the killer is till the very end, but with the hints such as Tom's mental breakdown, the mimic of the killer miner to Tom's movement, and all that at the very beginning of the movie is just not a recipe for a good movie.3/10 - mostly because of the 3D special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basically my opinion is that the reason this film got the rating 6.2/10 is because of the people who've seen the 3D-version. The movie goes along and every now and then there's these weird angles, which they included only because the movie was going to be presented as 3D.I saw the normal version, and at first the bizarre shooting angles were pretty funny. They stopped being amusing about 30 minutes after. Then they're just annoying.And the quality of the movie.. Well, acting wasn't so bad. But I doubt that anyone can take a horror movie seriously with so much killing and gallons of blood. If the movie would've been done with some humor involved, the result could have been a decent movie.Someone also said that the story of this movie was really original. Ugh. I couldn't agree less. The ending was a bit better than the rest of the film, but not original.So 4/10. Couldn't stop yawning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heart Shaped Boxes, Spooky Mines, and Pick-Axe Action Make for a Jolly Slasher Throwback.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"My Bloody Valentine" is a remake of the 1981 Canadian slasher flick. This film centers on the small, rural mining town of Harmony, in which a man named Harry Warden went on a gruesome killing spree on Valentine's Day that ended in his death inside of a local mine. A group of teenagers that survived his massacre include Tom (Jensen Ackles), his girlfriend Sarah (Jaime King), a local tough-guy Axel (Kerr Smith), and his girlfriend Irene (Betsy Rue). Ten years later, Axel and Sarah are married, and Tom returns to the town upon his father's death. But it seems that Harry Warden has returned, and terror takes over the town as people are killed one by one, with Tom being the prime suspect.In my eyes, George Mihalka's original "My Bloody Valentine" is a fun little horror flick that emerged during the slasher boom of the early 1980s. Many fans hail it, and I personally enjoyed it quite a bit, it's got something about it that sets it apart from the usual slasher fare. So, why remake it? Well, it wasn't a masterpiece by any means, and nearly every big- name horror film from the last 30 years has been remade, so this was in prime picking. And to my surprise, this was a pretty decent treatment of the story, with a lot of fun to be had by audiences. (Also note, I did not see the film in its 3D format, I saw it in standard 2D format, although it was fairly obvious which scenes were intended for the 3D).It takes the original script and re-works it a bit, throwing in tons more action and a boatload of gore (not surprisingly), and giving the plot a few more twists and turns to set it apart from the original. But while it is much more fast-paced and violent than its counterpart, this version does maintain the small-town atmosphere very well, and the characters are likable. They aren't your typical teenage victims, but rather are adults each with their own lives and problems (which is something that many fans of the original point out as being one of the film's strengths). They are clichéd in some aspects, though, as is the film. It's not cliché-free, that's for sure - plenty of "oh, we've seen that before" moments, and a few jump scares that fail to get a reaction.Now, for the gore aspect. The violence in this movie is extreme, over-the-top, and much more than what is necessary to irk the audience. Is this a bad thing? No, not necessarily in terms of what kind of movie this is. It's a bona fide slasher flick, nothing more, nothing less. It does attain some suspense which was an unexpected plus, and there are plenty of inventive and heart- pumping chase scenes (no pun intended). There are numerous pick-axes to the head, lots of fighting between the hulking villain (clad in his mining suit and gas mask) and the victims, and a handful of bloody human hearts wrapped up nicely in Valentine's candy boxes (which those who have seen the original will be very familiar of). Also memorable is the entire chase and murder scene of a completely naked woman at a local motel, which is a little ridiculous, but works in the fashion of the typical 1980s slasher mold. This movie is an all-around splatter fest, and is about ten times more gratuitous than the original, so anyone that is sensitive to this kind of stuff will probably want to steer clear.Patrick Lussier directs the film, and everything looks very nice. The town in particular captures that all-American feel, and all of the mine sequences are really nicely shot and particularly fun for the audience. But what I enjoyed most of all was its sense of self-awareness, as it is clearly a throwback to the notorious grind house-style splatter movies from the late 1970s - 1980s. It follows many of the formulas, sticks to the genre conventions, and doesn't try to break away from them- but all the time it is aware of this, and is perfectly fine with it. It's an all around intentional throwback to this style of horror cinema, and I liked that. There are even a few homages to the original (dryer scene, anyone?), which were nice to see as well.The actors here are all decent, with Jensen Ackles as the leading man, playing the "is he or isn't he?" sort of role. Jaime King is likable as Ackle's ex-girlfriend, the goodhearted Sarah. I've liked her in everything I've seen her in, and she plays the role of a small-town girl well. Kerr Smith of "Final Destination" plays Sarah's current husband in an interesting role, too, much to the opposition of the Ackles character. The final twenty minutes of the film are really fun and moderately tense, but the final shot had people going "Oh man, come on!". I didn't mind though, as I avoided taking the film too seriously for the sake of pure enjoyment, and it worked.Overall, "My Bloody Valentine" (3D or not) is an all around fun slasher flick. It's savagely entertaining, unnecessarily gory, and is done in the fashion of the 1980s splatter sub-genre. It is a completely self-aware throwback to the slasher movies of the good old days, and I respected the merit in this. It's good fun for genre fans, and an amusing re-boot of the original. I'll leave it at that. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is hands down the absolute worst piece of crap movie I have ever seen...and believe me I have seen a lot of bad films in my time. There is about 3-5 minutes of this movie that are even worth watching and about 3 of those are a fully naked girl running around. (What can I say, that part was enjoyable to watch). If that's not your thing, well, I can't say there's much worth watching except a few super gory shots here and there. Of course, that does not excuse the audacity this film has to suck in new ways and inconceivable ways. Seriously though, there is absolutely nothing good I can say about this movie. The plot is god awful and makes NO sense whatsoever. The majority of the "talent" in the movie are clearly only to make young teenagers swoon by their good looks, the rest must have fallen on hard times and will do anything for a paycheck. I think the makers/distributors of this film assume the viewer is so stupid and shallow they will not even care if it follows any logic because hey, there's some hotties in it! (Shame on you, Lionsgate). Apparently that's what this genre is being reduced to though. Sad times. Please, save yourself some brain cells and avoid this stinker like the plague. I wish I had known before it was too late.PS The 3-D sucks, the lines are off in every other shot and I finally just switched to regular ol' 2-D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extremely fun and gory return to old-school Slasher Horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror is one of my favorite genres. Whether it is serious sophisticated horror, or loud, gory, cheesy horror, I will watch it! My Bloody Valentine is a return to the 80's style slasher genre that is so over-the-top, loud, gory, and extremely entertaining and fun! I expected nothing more and nothing less than a very good 'trashy' film, and that is what I got. The opening credits were very inventive, and from the get-go the film starts off with all the possible gore. The writing and directing are good for what the film is. The acting was not bad, even for a film of this kind. Most were OK, but both Jensen Ackles and Kerr Smith are very talented actors, and are the only ones in the film that actually give very good performances. Kerr Smith is very natural, and Jensen Ackles has always been great in the T.V. cult show, Supernatural, and he portrayed some of those talents here. Although still nothing incredibly special, but for a film like this, I think it is better that way. There are a lot of great chase scenes, and the ending was very good, more than I expected. The end credits were also fabulous. I am one of those who watched it in regular 2-D, so I am expecting even more fun with 3-D! But grab a lot of your friends, have loud stereo sound, and prepare to have a lot of fun! My Bloody Valentine is thrilling, entertaining, and even funny at times. The only recent old-style slasher film, and personally one of my horror faves!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original "My Bloody Valentine" was never that great; a new special edition that re-instates cut gore has improved it. Still, it was dull and drab. This remake, which is gorier from the outset, attempts to polish its turd-like origins with 3-D. Some of the 3-D works, but it gave me a headache, nonetheless. Director Patrick Lussier is a hack, as are the writers (Todd Farmer and Zane Smith) of this illogical, sloppy slasher. The dialog is obvious and clichéd and the acting is weak; blame Lussier for that because he cast the thing and was supposed to be watching the performances. There are plenty of kills, but they're all variations on being gouged with a pickax. Blame Lussier also for the uninteresting, colorless look of this stinker. Cinematographer Brian Pearson was only serving Lussier's "vision". The best part of the film is watching Betsy Rue run around totally naked for ten minutes. It was a welcome distraction from the irritating predictability. Not much of the original premise is adhered to. It's still about a miner, but the supernatural aspect of the original has been jettisoned in favor of a lame psychological angle. Who cares?! I love good slashers, which is why I didn't like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young man, who survived a vicious massacre, returns to his hometown only to become the prime suspect when someone wearing miner's gear begins pick-axing the locals left and right! I didn't know what to expect from this remake of the 1981 slasher classic, heck I didn't know if my theater would even present it in 3-D, but it turned out to be an amusing little ride for this horror fan. Turns out I was lucky enough to see it at a theater showing it in 3-D and it was a surprisingly fun gimmick. My Bloody Valentine 3-D is a gory, fast-paced slasher film that delivers plenty of suspenseful action and lots of gruesome murders, which are all the more shocking thanks to the effectively neat 3-D presentation. The movie is well-directed and shot, and remains entertaining throughout.Still its not entirely flawless. Most of the characters never rise above being one dimensional, though the performances of the three leads (Ackles, King, and Smith) aren't bad, and the plot does stretch itself pretty thin by the end. It does have an admittedly good twist during the climax though.So here's the breakdown horror fans....The Good:- suspenseful action scenes - clever and gruesome murder scenes - impressive 3-D effects - an engaging story with one solid twist - nudity (both male and female) for the trash lover in you - an R rating (because there's no such thing as a good PG-13 slasher movie) The Not-so-good:- some weak supporting characters - some routine slasher clichés - a conclusion that's not entirely satisfying So the good does out weigh the bad in this energized remake. It's definitely fun for horror fans and it's one of the better classic horror remakes in quite some time. Try to catch it in 3-D though.** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great return to 3D fun and 80's slasher.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of 3D, especially the early 80's 3D, I couldn't wait to see this one as it is the first hardcore/slasher type 3D movie since "Friday the 13th Part III." (No, "Freddy's Dead" does not count because it was only the last ten minutes and in anaglyph 3D/Red &amp; blue lenses.) After the initial police walk through of a crime scene, I was settling in for the "get to know the young cast" section of this movie, only to find out that part of them were dead already and we were seeing the killer was busy dispatching some more. This movie gets moving right from the beginning. There are some awesome 3D moments that pay homage to some of the classic "3D's" of the past,(Created differently here though.), such as the eyeball popping scene from "Friday III," the car crash/pole through the windshield scene in "Amityville 3D" and the poker through the door in the Vincent Price "House of Wax." This movie also offers some great 3D moments of its own, but I don't want to spoil those.Now, this is a slasher film for those of you with your noses stuck up in the air or worse, the jerks who like to talk and degrade horror films the whole way through(Pseudo-intellectuals suck. It also makes it really hard for to enjoy the movie.) This is intended to be fun and the 3D really enhances the horror scenery. It is a good update and retelling of the early 80's film, which I need to see again and will since there is a new and restored release with 9 minutes of pristine footage added back in(Removed by our friends at the MPAA, of course. Odd, they even have the power to make decisions for completed films that are not American!) Everything said; if you like a cool slasher film and fun, check this film out in 3D. You will definitely be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Film, More Blood, More Nudity!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the 1953 classic chiller "House of Wax" to the 1982 slasher "Friday the 13th Part III," Hollywood has relied on 3-D technology to heighten shock and suspense. The primeval nature of the horror genre is synonymous with the stereoscopic visuals.So when I heard Lionsgate was releasing a 3-D reimagining of the 1981 horror flick "My Bloody Valentine," I was excited. I was, and still am, a fan of the genre, and I specially liked the original film which Quentin Tarantino called "the best slasher movie of all time." The good news about the new flick? Because of the film's 3-D technology, it is bigger in cinematic scope. But dazzling stereographic technology also means more blood and more nudity, with a little less attention focused on coherence.But I suspect the film's target audience will not mind. Give them blood and ample nudity, and they will come back over and over again.For those familiar with the original 1981 film, the new "My Bloody Valentine 3-D" has the same narrative structure. Ten years ago, a tragedy changed the town of Harmony forever.An inexperienced coal miner caused an accident in the tunnels that trapped and killed five men and sent the only survivor, Harry Warden (Richard John Walters) into a permanent coma.But a year later on Valentine's day, Warden woke up and brutally murdered twenty-two people with a pickaxe. Ouch! According to the town's lore, Warden was killed. Or was he? Ten years later, someone is killing Harmony residents again. This unstoppable killer has the same neurotic penchant for using pickaxe as his weapon of choice and for dressing up like a miner.Everyone's a suspect. Is the killer Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles), the son of the owner of the mine who's been missing for ten years? Or is it Axel Palmer (Kerr Smith), the town sheriff who holds a grudge against Hanniger? Adding insult to injury, Palmer is now married to Hanniger's former girlfriend, Sarah (Jamie King).Now, a love triangle is formed, and their Valentine's day promises to be very bloody.Director Patrick Lussier ("Dracula 2000"), working from a script by Todd Farmer ("The Messengers") and Zane Smith, uses horror genre conventions to tell his story ? the damsel in distress and the indestructible serial killer.But I did like that the damsel is now empowered and doesn't have to wait for her knight in shining armor to save her. Our heroine is not just a scream queen anymore.I was complaining early on about the film's nudity. But the one scene involving gratuitous full-frontal female nudity is actually one of the movie's most terrifying moments.I also liked the film's whodunit structure, but the journey towards guessing the killer, specially the middle part of the film, lags. In their efforts to hide the killer's identity, Lussier and company sacrificed dramatic structure. The result is a muddled second half that uses obligatory flashback scenes to tell the story.The acting ensemble is fine given the film's by-the-numbers premise. But I would be lying if I told you I didn't close my eyes in terror a number of times. I hate the term "it is what it is" but the filmmakers made a slasher flick they sought out to do."My Bloody Valentine 3-D" is scary, bloody, and oddly sexy. Sex and gore in 3-D! Our movie-going habit hasn't changed one bit.And for that, "My Bloody Valentine 3-D" gets 2 ? slasher kissesCheck out my full interviews with the cast on www.mannythemovieguy.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taking a good look at the two heavily populated cinema 'lives' of the slasher genre, the most striking similarity in both is that they were started by the box office successes of two stand-out features. First Halloween in 78 launched a tidal wave of wannabes that included the much maligned but equally heavily imitated Friday the 13th series. The category had a good run, but eventually lost popularity mid-way through the eighties due to a restriction on gore and a lack of funding and creativity from production teams. Wes Craven's popular semi-parody, Scream from 1996, kicked off yet another major influx that sent the imitations crawling out of the woodwork and on to video-store shelves. Eventually, a lack of originality meant audiences and studios alike gave up on the cycle and it befell a similar fate that had sent its forefathers into obscurity.There were thirteen years between the death of the Halloween-inspired glory days and Scream's unexpected re-birth, so a believer in destiny may indeed be forgiven for predicting the time is upon us for another run of masked killers and gratuitous gore.It has been a good few months for fans of the original My Bloody Valentine. Not only have we learned that we will finally be able to see the full uncut version of the original, repackaged on a shiny new DVD with extras, but also we have been treated to this highly financed remake at a time when the category had pretty much sunk to the lowest of depths.Harry Warden's name lives long in the memories of the townsfolk of a small town in West Virginia after he went on a maniacal killing spree, butchering 22 people on a cold valentine's night. Despite rumours that he was buried alive in the mines that he stalked, the body of the maniac has never been discovered. Fast forward ten years and it seems that the evil has returned, because a gas-masked maniac begins stalking the village and killing everyone that was somehow connected to the original massacre. Has Harry returned? As the title accurately informs us, a key gimmick for the release of this remake was the fact that it is filmed in explosive 3D. Now many have tried to bring horror into the third-dimension, but the likes of Friday the 13th III, Silent Madness and Freddy's Dead had failed drastically to make the most of an ingenious tool in the creation of supreme virtual terror. So with all that was riding against it, does My Bloody Valentine 3D actually deliver?? Like hell it does! Buckle your seat belts baby and prepare yourself for a speed-train through slasher clichés that has never been taken to such extreme heights. This is a non-stop juggernaut of fast-paced gore and shock tactics that will keep your heart beating at the speed of a Japanese freeway. You can mock the brainless script and the at times overly-gratuitous exploitation, but this is a slasher movie and slasher movies exist to give you two-hours of freedom from the stress of everyday life in a virtual-world where you can leave your brains at the door.Firstly, the film is immensely gory. So much so that even a hardened old horror-addict like myself was cowering from the screen in places. Pick-axes through faces, dismemberment, eyes popping out of their sockets; and best of all, it's all filmed in fantastic 3D. This is a car-crash of over indulgence that has the balls to drive to the borders of cinematic acceptability and then smash through them with its pedal to the medal. The pace is unrelenting and the suspense at times absolutely immense. Patrick Lussier may not be the next Hitchcock, but MBV 3D is not to be categorised alongside Psycho or Halloween. This is a film that sets out to shock in any way possible and on that level it succeeds. There's one or two tense jump out of your seat jolts and a few credibly created scares that are all the better for the stylish production.The cast do a good enough job of keeping the plot moving fluidly and the healthy financing means that no expense has been spared in the producer's effort to unleash total mayhem on audiences. Jamie King takes us back to the Laurie Strode/Ginny Field era of brave heroines, but somewhat authentically, she also has huge character flaws. The story shares much with its predecessor and Lussier also re-uses many of the scenes that made Mihalka's hit so memorable. This may well be the first slasher remake that actually pays credit to its heritage and unlike Rob Zombie's insulting Halloween re-hash, MBV 3D can sit comfortably alongside its grandfather.It's not fashionable to give a slasher movie a good review and I can see without looking the piles of one-star write-ups that are cluttering up column-space in the self-righteous brigade's film magazines. I bet that Egbert is having a field day ripping this particular movie to shreds. Agreed, this is not an intellectual film. To be fair, in some places it doesn't even do the basics right and there's some shockingly poor plot holes towards the climax.For a fan of splatter flicks however, this is an hour and a half in paradise and I really enjoyed every moment of this long-overdue gore-soaked extravaganza.This is not the next Shawshank Redemption and it has no intention of trying to be, so it should be judged on its merits as a gore film and on that level it is everything that you want it to be. Full frontal nudity, buckets of gore and all the things that your mama warned you about rapped up in a tense and riveting thriller with the added bonus of an intelligent twist (Was the killer really the only bad guy? I wouldn't call the 'hero' good...) Prepare for the next invasion folks</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this movie, not expecting anything grand or special. The only reason I did go was so that I could see Jensen Ackles on the big screen. I am a big Supernatural fan, and I was excited to see him, not so much the movie.Overall, the story line was decent. It has been done before so it's nothing that is going to blow you away. It was a typical slasher film with lots and lots of gore (very gruesome gore), and sex and nudity, which is something I did find to be a tad bit unnecessary for the film and something I frowned upon. The scene (only one) could have been done exactly the same with clothes...there was no real point to nudity.Anyway, the 3D was very cool, and I would suggest seeing it in 3D. It doesn't make you dizzy and it isn't overpowering as if to take away from the story. The 3D was done tastefully.Acting was alright. Jensen Ackles and Kerr Smith did a good job as main actors for the role. The rest were...decent. Special Effects was actually...really, really good. One scene in particular I actually really, really loved (towards the end, Jensen and Lights....that's all I'll say..XD) Overall, the movie was decent...better than I had thought. However, if Jensen hadn't been in this movie, I doubt I would have gone to see it. But, fellow Supernatural fans and Ackles Lovers, you will definitely enjoy watching Jensen on the big screen, I guarantee it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Garbage Compared to the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 1981 My Bloody Valentine is a thrill-ride from beginning to end, filmed in the underground coal mines of Sydney Mines, Nova Scotia. It was a classic low-budget but thrilling entertaining horror movie. Lionsgate bought the rights to it and in 2009 created a remake in 3D. The only good thing about this is that Lionsgate released the seven minutes of lost footage from the original, but the remake is pretty pathetic, with a flat group of characters, none of whom have much personality, way too much graphic nudity that took away from the plot just to have perverts pay to see it, and bad heavy metal -dubstep type soundtrack. CGI effects really took away from the dreary atmosphere the original managed to capture, and the plot was so distorted that half the time it was too hard to know what was going on. The acting wasn't very good at all. The beginning, featuring a group of stoned drunk bimbo kids partying, was just plain stupid. While the original was more believable, the remake was way too far-fetched; either the evil miner is some hallucination or a ghost, it makes no sense. In the original part of what made the movie great was that contrary to the typical groups of spoiled suburban high schoolers in most slasher movies, My Bloody Valentine featured a small industrial Canadian mining town full of average working-class joes. The remake goes with the 21st century teens of today, nothing on their minds but sex and drugs and booze, which added to the boring acting and flat characters. To really get into detail, I lived in Sydney Mines, coal mining gas masks are the same as the one Harry wore in the 1981 film. In the 2009 one they have used gas masks from Russia, the same type worn in the Chernobyl disaster, masks that would never be used for coal mining in reality. Not to get technical or anything but if you're going to make a movie at least order the right equipment for the costumes. Believe me this movie isn't worth your time, just stick with the original, remakes today are ruining everything in horror films, stick with the classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Bloody Valentine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Title: My Bloody ValentineCondensed Storyline: This is a remake of the 1981 movie of the same name. I am generally neutral to remakes and reboots mainly because I get to see the same movie more or less with better camera quality and different actors. Sometimes it is good like the Dredd reboot or sometimes it bad like the Total Recall remake. The plot is that an old man who killed his fellow miners wakes up and goes on a killing spree, targeting the teens in the old mine before just moving onto random victims. The police arrive and shoot Harry, who runs off into the mines deeper. But he seems to return 10 years later, just as Tom revisits the town. It then turns into a blame game with everyone accusing each other of being the killer. But as people get picked off one by one, you see the miner go after Tom. This leads everyone to believe the miner is Axel, but the surprise plot twist at the end reveals that Tom was diagnosed with a mental disorder and his split personality is the miner who is killing everyone. But I really enjoy the way that they do it so he isn't aware that he is doing any of it, yet an entire bar fight starts because he simply just walks into the bar. You can really sympathize with the character. They think they kill him, but in the end he is shown to have survived. Notable Acting: I liked the cast, not everyone equally. That is natural with movies, but every character I found annoying was killed so that made me happy. The main characters are relatable to an extent and are believable mostly. Along with the important point of me actually caring about what happened to them, I wanted Tom to survive and regardless of him being the killer, he did survive. Axel played the dick of a sheriff who is looking more shady as the movie progresses until it is clear that he isn't the miner. The two CONI having sex before they get killed is a bit of stale acting, but in saying that. When has porn or faked porn ever had good acting? But needless to say this keeps my favourite horror movie rule in tact, sex = death. We also get to see actual breasts along with full female nudity in the scene as well. There is until her and the midget get killed. Horror movies just keep giving more reason to be loved regardless of how cheesy many of them are. Noticeable Camera work: Nice focus pull of the bloody hand in the first hospital scene. We get two gems in the space of second between each other, in the mine scene when the CONI (Character of no importance) knocks his head and falls onto the floor we see a worms eye POV view followed by a POV shot, the cinematographer did a good job there. The main stable of the camera work is the cinematographer's amazing use of POV shots, along with incorporating them into other kinds of shots. Similar to their use of power position shots such as the worm's and bird's eye shots. We see a split screen on Tom and the miner while Tom is in the cage. Knowing that Tom is the miner allows you to see this from a new perspective as you can see it as Tom looking at his darker represented by the miner, this is made better by the fact that for the first part, the miner mimics Tom's moves. We also get a zoom in shot of Tom in the cage accompanied by the music spiking to rise the tension. One of the greatest pieces of editing I've seen has to be at the end when Tom is smashing out the light, as the light goes out you see the miner within the split second, this is simple but so damn effective and impressive. Graphics: To give you a bit of backstory about the events which lead up to the movie, we are given a comic/newspaper style intro with voice over. Those who read my review of Repo The Genetic Opera knows that I was very fond of his graphic in that movie, I am fond of it in this movie also. Even if it is only for the opening title scene. The mutilation effects are actually quite good, but it differs from a movie like Scream where it is just body stabbings, this move has pickaxes going through heads and knocking out eyes and all sorts.Costume: The blood dripping from the hand is less realistic however as once it drops you see it string slightly, blood behaves more like water in the sense that it drop without it's string trail. The actual costume of the miner is consisted of overalls, hosed gas mask and helmet with light on it. This does actually give the look of an old miner and the lenses of the gas mask are darkened so you can't see the eyes, holds similar to other horror movie villains who's face and eyes you cannot see. Dehumanizes them in a manor of speaking. The sound of the forced breathing through the mask adds to that, this can only make things better as this is one of my favourite horror movie killer costumes. Overall Feel: The heavy filtered breathing through the mask is made all the greater when it is accompanied by silence of everyone including most of the musical score. Just adds that sense of tension to an already suspenseful movie. His movie is also very creative for the ways it kills some characters, an example is where one CONI is killed by a shovel style decapitation. Simple, enjoyable coherent horror slasher movie. This is high if not at the top of my horror list. Low rating on IMDb is a shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry Warden is dead?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine is directed by Patrick Lussier and collectively written by Zane Smith, Todd Farmer and John Beaird. It stars Jensen Ackles, Jaime King, Kerr Smith, Kevin Tighe and Tom Atkins. Music is by Michael Wandmacher and cinematography by Brian PearsonA remake of George Mihalker's 1981 slasher, the 2009 version was released in a blaze of 3D frenzy, where it absolutely coined it in at the World's box offices. It's not hard to see why, for no matter how much we may moan about remakes and the general languid nature of slashers turned out just for coin, there's a big market out there for them. As it happens this isn't half bad, oh it's all very familiar, there's another Michael Myers clone stalking the residents of some American town and offing them in gruesome ways. Here the perp is The Miner, dressed up in his work clothes, armed with a pick-axe, face covered by a gas mask that in turn makes him creepy looking and gives him Darth Vader breathing exercises to do.The mystery element is that this new series of murders are being re- enacted from crimes ten years previously, so is the old killer back from the dead, or is there a copycat at large? Enter troubled teenagers, townsfolk acting suspiciously and mucho blood and screaming sitting in tandem together. There's the requisite amount of nudity, including one of the longest nude scenes ever, while Lussier shows a good knack for blending humour with the terror. The 3D is of a high standard, and the sound mix is incredible, this really is one to give your sub-woofer a work out. It pans out as expected, but it manages to eek out good suspense for its finale and having Atkins and Tighe in the movie is a reassuring presence.The original was no great film anyway, and although this is better, it's still just a bunch of acting props being killed in different ways. But it is effective and above all else it's fun. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent movie but doesn't have heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of the original "My Bloody Valentine" and when I heard that they were remaking it, well I was rather intrigued, I thought that this would be a great chance for the original to be more remembered and after viewing the trailers, well I wanted to see this movie even more, and when I did, I kept an open mind and I was pleased.This movie is fast paced, entertaining, tons of kills and tons of gore, and the fact that this is 3D it really lives up to the potential. But this movie doesn't have the heart the original has, despite some decent performances, the characters are unlikeable and the final scenes are a major letdown as the whodunit angle is poorly structured and offers no surprise whatsoever. Although the film isn't bad it does feel overlong at times, but there are several high points like the motel death scenes are a true highlight and extremely entertaining and fun, the weapon of choice is a pick axe which is used to its full potential and goes wonderfully over the top.The performances we get Supernatural's Jensen Ackles does okay as the main character, but seems unconvincing at times, Jaime King whose seems to be the queen of slasher remakes, gives a decent performance and convincing, she was definitely the most convincing character in this movie. Kerr Smith was just basically unlikeable and uninteresting and finally genre favourite Tom Atkins, who makes a pleasant comeback and settles in comfortably. But the rest of the cast unfortunately weren't given any amount of decent air time and basically faded into the background.All in all "My Bloody Valentine" doesn't quite have the heart of the original, but still a decent flick that will stand the test of time in years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional remake to a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years after a tragedy, a troubled man returns to a small mining town that finds itself victim to a copycat murderer killing off the residents and forcing the local sheriff to stop the killings before it targets him and his family.Certainly not the best remake in the current generation, it's not even the best slasher remake, but it certainly has it's fun moments. The gore here is certainly the best part, as the killings are all rather well-done and brutal if missing a bit of variety (as fun as it is to watch a pickax implanted into every orifice imaginable, it needed a couple extra bits done by a different weapon or tactic so that it doesn't feel like it's the same thing done again and again) and the splatter makes for some fun times. Several stalking scenes worked incredibly well and definitely got some nice tension, and the full-on nudity is another extremely welcome plus. The problem here is the fact that it tries way too hard to homage the original (I'm looking straight at the dead body in the washing machine and the dropped overalls from which the killer emerges to slash at a victim here) as well as the part with the valentine's hearts, and overall it really didn't do much to tie itself into it's title (a problem with the original but it's far less noticeable there as it was here) coming off forced rather than a natural part of the story. As usual, the 3D and especially the CGI look atrocious and just plain poorly done and quite obvious, making for a distraction rather than an enhancement of the scene. Overall, though, it's not too bad.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Full Nudity, Graphic Language and a mild sex scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do watch a lot of trashy horror films, oh look a remake of My bloody Valentine, I guess i'll give it a whirl. Well, not bad, a cut above most remakes. Well I could say I enjoyed it more than the original. The characters were not bad, would you believe they are adults this time around, what a shocker. The Tom Hanniger character was a nuisance. The rest were likable enough. I have to say the Irene chase scene was ridiculous, not to mention way over board in terms of nudity, she must not think to much of her self. There is no way that scene is suspenseful or terrifying, more of a comedic joke if you ask me. You will understand if you see it. Axel was a sleaze-ball, but you still don't want him to die. The violence will satisfy any gore hound, large amounts of bloody violence. There was some suspense to who the killer was, but it was pretty obvious throughout. The 3D is garbage, there is a part where an eye comes toward the screen, kind of like the Friday the 13th part 3, very silly. Although I did enjoy it the first time, I tried watching it a second but couldn't sit through it. Not a great film, but it's dumb fun, give it a watch if you are into this kind of thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Much Going For It Sad to Say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie's simple purpose is to not only suck at actually being a movie, but to suck at being at least a good gore fest. The whole premise is that random objects will fly at you IF you happening to be watching it in 3D. I was simply skimming thru late night television when I saw it and that's the movie's greatest fault. If you're not watching it with a pair of 3D glasses on, the majority of the effects look like crap. See, when it was out in theaters I'm afraid the trailer, which I think many can agree, didn't really catch my interest. The story is weak and has been done a thousand times over. The so-called twists weren't all that astonishing. My relationship with horror is that if you're going to be repetitive at least build up the atmosphere, but no such luck here. In the end it's just another "No, it's him!! Not me!1" shoot-out. I warn all to stay clear of this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a hip new update of the 80's Canadian slasher. (I'm not a fan of the early incarnation either) This one starts off rather promising; Miner gets caught in a cave in, resorts to murder and cannibalism to survive, goes on rampage when he's pulled out of the mine and townspeople discover his crimes. Years later mine's owner returns to town, and a killer miner also reappears. The plot was okay, the opening massacre was just plain awesome, but the 3d gimmicks weren't enough to save the movie with it's silly ending. 3D impaling of a midget was cool, but (spoiler)*******************Making the killer a figment of deranged mine owner's imagination just plain ridiculous.</fullReview>

The 3D effects were pretty good and the effects were good :) You can tell there was a lot of hard work on this movie! But i can't give it more than a 7, strictly for the fact that i know there's scarier movies. But its a very good movie and i do recommend it. I'd love to see a 2nd one :) Jensen Ackles was a WONDERFUL actor in this movie. The movie totally had me drawn in most of the time. There were a few parts that seemed to drag on but barley any.

This movie had so much gore and violence in it- which is how a good horror should be.It also had many scenes where I was on the edge of my seat wondering if the person will get alway from the serial killer or not.You cant tell who the serial killer is for real as there are several people in the movie that could be and it confused me because I really wanted to know who the killer really was.The performances from Jaime King,Jensen Ackles,Kerr Smith were all great. I thought the original was better but this one was a really good remake.I thought the ending of the movie was actually stupid and didn't get it at all.I enjoyed this movie so much I have watched it twice in a row one day.I would give this movie a 9/10 for the acting,plot,cast, over the top violence.It deserves a better rating than the current 5.7/10.

		<shortDescription>A Miner Incident</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** It when Tom Hanniger, Jensen Ackles, came back home to Harmony after a ten year absence that things started to quickly unravel in that one industry mining town. First of all Tom plans to sell the mine that he inherited from his deceased father and thus put Harmony's miners out of work. What's even worse Tom's actions had somehow resurrected the deranged dead and murderous coal miner Harry Warden, Richard John Walters. Walter as it turns out is a man with a plan to wipe out the entire town for what to did to him ten years ago: Put him in his grave after he murdered 22 of Harmony's citizens!In the film the mysterious Harry Warden with his trusty pickax goes on a killing rampage targeting those responsible for his death some ten years ago as well as anyone else who just happens to get in the way of his work. Harry chooses Valentine Day to do his bloody work since it was on that day ten years earlier that the townspeople headed by Sheriff Jim Burke, Tom Atkins, did the crazed and out of control miner in! There's also in the movie Tom's ex girlfriend Sarah, Jami King, who left him for Axel Palmer, Kerr Smith, who's now the towns sheriff. It's Axel who feels that Tom is trying to steal his wife away from him which makes his job of catching the now back to life Harry Warden that much more difficult!We get to see the work of Warden, in eye-popping 3-D, both before and after his death, when he was resurrected, which is some of the most horrifying and gut crunching scenes ever to be put in a psycho/slasher movie. With his deadly pickax Walden starts out killing as soon as he makes his first appearance in the movie. One of Werdens' first victims is Sarah's good friend Irene, Betty Rue, and her trucker "boyfriend" or "John" Frank, Todd Farmer. The two are butchered together with Annie Katral the hotel desk clerk by a gas masked wearing Warden at the local Thunderbird Motel.***SPOILER*** At first not believing that Harry Warden is really the killer Sheriff Palmer puts the entire towns population in jeopardy in giving him a free ride in conducing his murder spree. It's when the former sheriff Jim Burke and his then, back in 1999, deputy get viciously pickaxed to death by the murderous Warden that evidence emerges to who this long dead Welden really is! Tom who had earlier confronted Welden, who let him get away, in the Hanniger Mine shaft has become convinced that the killer was non other then Sheriff Palmer himself!***MAJOR SPOILER*** It's now up to Tom to get Palmer's wife, and his ex girlfriend, Sarah to get as far away from her husband before he makes her his next victim! It's at the end of the film, in the Hanniger Mine shaft, that the truth about just who this Harry Warden really is suddenly comes to light! He's not just a ghost from the past but a flesh and blood serial killer who's been lying dormant all this time until Valentine Day, the date of Warden's previous miner massacre, brought him back to life!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here we have yet another "return of the psycho-indestructible-killer who lives to splay and splatter his victims" flick. Let's see, Jason, Michael Myers, Leatherface, Freddie Kruger...no wait a minute! Freddie Kruger talked; a bit out of character! Ah, but there's always room for one more crazed, invincible psycho-slasher. This one's a remake of the 1981 film of nearly identical title, as it was sans "3D", where a vengeful miner pays back those who done him wrong in the worst kind of way. In this latest effort the crazed miner seems to make a come back on Valentine's Day to again butcher and bludgeon. Naturally, the plot is threadbare, but this version does its best to add a little soap opera to the gore fest, that being a romantic triangle between the local sheriff, his wife and an old friend from high school days. The splatter scenes are hashed out with true mayhem and 3D effects, such as the minter's favorite weapon, his pick-axe, charging out of the screen into our faces. It's odd that the miner has a Valentine's Day fetish, that being placing his victim's hearts in heart-shaped valentine's gift boxes. No explanation is ever offered for this deranged little ritual, nor is it clear how removing a heart and placing it in a box--a job that would not be easy for a surgeon with an array of surgical tools--is accomplished with a pick-axe?? But these are mere trivial complaints. We must give the fans what they came for....blood, guts and naked women! If you've seen Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, or Friday the 13th., you should be able to guess how this one ends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is it with me, why do I hate remakes these days. I was warned by a friend, watch it in this era, forget the original one. Well, did I missed the era of the eighties and the seventies, Make up guru's like Bottim and Savini and all the rest of them using real effects in stead of CGI. But today it's the era of computers and CGI, of course, I watched the 3D full uncut but for me it didn't deliver. It wasn't gory for me, well yes I know that a lot of people will say, huh, no gore? It's the one killing after the others. Yes I know but still...If you watch The Prowler or Friday in those days, they really deliver gore. Here we see the use of CGI and that's what I have against CGI, you may use it but don't see it, got it? The storyline is okay but the role of Jensen Ackles is for me not satisfying. At the end when he has his close up just before the end credits I didn't found him believable. And the fact that there is full frontal nudity in it says it all. You may use nudity if it has a function in the movie, here it is in it just to attract the younger geeks out there. She's naked for at least a few minutes seeing all of her parts. It doesn't got the film going. Is it all that bad, no, there are sure some killings that are well done, without CGI. Just let me say, watch Midnight Meat Train or Borderland to see what you can do without CGI. Ho, the first scene in the hospital, there are just to many bodies to be believable. And I can go on, sorry for all the freaks out there, after the failure of the Friday the 13th remake this one doesn't deliver either. In a few minutes I will watch Last House On The Left remake. Let's hope that this deliver...or am I really to old to watch these new ones? Although Hostel and Saw has it all for me</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody Fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I need to preface this review by admitting that I loathe the current trend of re-making films, and that I have seen most of my favorite horror movies of all time desecrated by greedy film-makers looking to make a quick buck off of established titles instead of utilizing any imagination of their own and coming up with something original.This particular film, however, is quite an interesting experiment: what happens if we remake a movie that wasn't really that good to begin with? If this film is the answer, then I must concede that perhaps coming up with something new isn't all that great when you can mine (no pun intended... well, maybe just a little bit) horror's past for an interesting idea that wasn't brought to fruition in a satisfying way.The original My Bloody Valentine was a great idea (a fantastic title, murders on the love holiday, a cool mythos to spark the killings, and a big dude in a miner's suit who could be just about anyone), but the film itself is far from a classic example of 80's slasher greatness. At best, it rates as "decent", which is to say that I own it, but I can readily think of at least 20 other films I would show someone newly curious about the genre before getting to MBV.By taking these elements and shaping them into a well-crafted story with multi-layered characters we truly end up being invested in, the modern day My Bloody Valentine is actually one of the best horror films in recent memory.Anyone can string together a bunch of creative death scenes (actually, sadly, most modern horror film makers don't even manage that), but making a film that ties the gruesome bits together with a narrative that gives these scenes impact is a trickier beast altogether. I point this out because I'm realizing that at this point I have yet to mention anything about the most crucial element of MBV: the slashing.Watching this film, one has to wonder how the film-makers thought up so many interesting uses for a pick-axe, because despite the stringent choice of weaponry by the killer here, the kill scenes in this film are extremely well-executed and diversely gruesome enough to please this 30-year fan of the genre. There are some truly spectacular splatter set-pieces on display here, and those who get that giddy surge of adrenaline that accompanies a well-played "gotcha" moment in slasher films will find plenty to smile about.The 3-D gimmick has been spectacularly lame in horror's past, but in this film, the trick actually works very well. The producers weren't content to just throw a pick-axe at the screen every 10 minutes, they actually plotted some creative uses of the technology that add extra juice to the more tension-based scenes in the film.This combination makes My Bloody Valentine quite an awesome piece of horror fare. It's not often that the splatter genre gives us something that can be admired as both a suitably grisly collection of death scenes and as a well-made cinematic experience. Couple that with the low expectations that have to accompany a modern re-make of a film that was relatively weak to begin with, and you have an extremely surprising and wholly enjoyable offering.Overall, this film shows that a re-make can build on the ideas of the past instead of recycling them. Seeing how easily they pull it off here, I have to wonder why every other "re-imagining" I've been forced to sit through for the past several years has been such a dreadfully lame experience. This one isn't, and I highly recommend it for lifers and new converts alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine is (2009) back and in 3-D! The 3-D makes what would have been a mundane remake into a real fun flick. I love the gory set pieces and the new 3-D is ten times better that the old red/blue process. The story is more of a quasi sequel than a true remake similar to Friday the 13th (2009). Even though the story is not that compelling the real reason to watch this remake is for the gore and 3-D. I hope this movie made some money because I want to see more films in 3-D.Another reason I'm glad the remake came out is because the original My Bloody Valentine was released on DVD in it's original uncut glory. But after seeing it, I have no reason why these effects were cut to begin with. The remake is so much more graphic. I guess the MPAA was cracking down on violence during the 80's.Recommended</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possibly one of the first 3D horror flicks ever, I just couldn't pass this up, and neither could many others, judging by the enthusiastic response and anticipation in the theatre hall just because of the novelty factor, with oohs and ahhs being echoed each time something seem to fling itself from the screen toward the audience. And I'm only talking about the trailer there. I guess it will take a while for the novelty to wear off, though until then, with the selection of 3D films thus far screened at an affordable price, it might just be one of the pull factors to draw in the crowds and put bums on seats.Like any horror-slasher flick with potential to become a franchise, My Bloody Valentine started off with a bang, and if not for some sporadic body counts in between to lift the narrative sag, it would have been sunk way before the long-drawn finale. To horror buffs, the clues as to the identity of the killer miner would be so obvious, that you'd just be crossing your fingers in the hope that you're wrong. It begins with a brief history of The Miner Harry Warden who goes on a killing rampage, and in quite exciting terms of torn limbs and dismembered insides. Friends like Sarah (Jaime King), Axel (Kerr Smith) and Tom (Jensen Ackles) come face to face with the killer on night in a party in the mines, only for the police to intervene and save the town of Harmony.Fast forward 10 years later, and we see Sarah and Axel married, with Tom dropping by after his disappearance that night to rekindle some old flame. But his return also heralds the beginning of brutal killings in the modus operandi of The Miner, and it is only natural that suspicion will fall upon the prodigal son's return, if not for the picture of other characters being painted in unsavoury terms to provide a whole host of suspects.It's the usual pursuit of a killer who's always one step ahead, and in between we have some attempted drama between love lost, and Valentine's Day being in the the festival of choice (hence the title) to set this story against. But this aspect of a love triangle fell flatly on its face, and seriously, we're not here for the strength of the plot, but by the variety of ways the body count gets chalked up. To that, there's no shortfall of bloody gore, as you can imagine how creative one can be with the weapon of choice ? a pick axe ? being in the hands of a psychotic killer.For instance, there's impalement by the masses through different body parts as entry points. You name it, you get it, from the eye to the top of the head, from midsections cut open to what I thought was the best use of a shovel thus seen in a slasher flick. Being in 3D also meant the gore factor got cranked up a notch, since copious amounts of blood come splashing onto you, and you just might duck when the pick axe got swung in your direction. Some may comment that I'm being a sadist, but I suppose films designed in such nature are for those who expect exactly that, for entertainment and fun escapism, not meant to win awards.No new ground was broken as a horror movie because it too relied too much on the usual loud banging noises, sudden appearances and quick edits. It makes no qualms to appeal to the lowest denominator and doesn't even attempt to build up any atmosphere. It does take a while to get to the fun bits, and when it does you'll probably find yourself enjoying every sick part of it. The only obstacle standing in its way of become a franchise spawning many sequels, is the stark lack of motivation of the killer, other than of course being plain psychotic, which is the requisite, and demonstrated so in quite haphazard terms with dots left unconnected.Should you decide to watch this, do yourself a big favour and do so only on the 3D format. And stay right through to the end after the credits roll for that one final swing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun enough for what it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately, we didn't check that the cinema we went to showed the movie in 3D, and of course it didn't, so we missed out on the effects which, according to the reviews, were the main redeeming feature of the film.No one expects deep character development, Oscar-winning acting or philosophical depths in a slasher flick. This type of movies is expected to have some scares, horrible deaths, plus sex and nudity. On these levels it delivers. It's creepy and gruesome, yet I somehow found it less nasty than a lot of horror movies nowadays.There are lots of predictable moments in this movie, but when it came to figuring out the identity of the killer this film surprised me. Usually I'm good at guessing this kind of thing early, so MBV-3D gets an extra point for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Theater Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't had such a lively time at the theater in 5 years. We arrived for the projection along with a hundred 12-or-so-year-old kids, all giggly and loud like they were on a party (fortunately, no censorship was enforced on the movie at all in Croatia. It's open to the general audience. Of course, movie-goers here have the common sense not to bring their newborn or toddler to something called "My Bloody Valentine 3D" but I did see this as fun scary movie for everyone. Not a horror but, by definition, a scary movie).The theater was in a constant uproar, or at least filled with chatter. It's not that the movie was so boring that nobody paid attention - it was just overflown with enthusiasm at the 3D feature, and people were constantly posing for photos with their glasses on. Now, I'm usually annoyed by a loud and uninterested cinema audience, but this movie was almost made to bombard you and the horde of thrill-seeking teenagers surrounding you with cheap scares, it doesn't take itself too seriously and it has a number of over-the-top fun details and glaring plot problems that you can make fun of.Now, about the movie itself, I didn't expect much from it. It sounded like your run-of-the-mill slasher, however, it's something more - it's a damn good slasher! I'm not talking Halloween-good; fans of atmospheric chiller masterpieces or the new PG-13 ghost story mysteries have nothing to look forward to here (plot-and-theme-wise). On the other hand, fans of the tense, shallow, chauvinistic fun-horror genre are going to be overwhelmed, because this one has it all: naked chicks (female full frontal nudity for several minutes! Presbyterians, keep away), flying pickaxes, a wide and diverse assortment of kills, the most imaginative ones I've seen in a long time, a rather down-to-earth but fun cast of characters, a who's-the-killer-mystery, an iconic antagonist with a really awesome suit, a good soundtrack and tons of unrestricted gore flying out of the screen in 3D and landing in your face.As far as tension goes, the movie rocks. The miner-killer has a very menacing demeanor that will make the entire audience hold their breaths even if it's a more unbridled one (like the energetic kids I had) when he's on screen. The action and chases are loud, exciting and fun, regularly culminating in a gory, stylish kill (followed by fifty teen girls screaming their heads off in unison for ten minutes). Yes, it all ends in loud noises, violins going batshit-crazy and tons of 3D brains splattering around - it's a cheap scare, but it works like a charm.As a "horror" (I prefer "scary movie" here), it's okay. Not great, but a fun change of pace compared to the recent tame flicks. As a non-genre-movie, it brings nothing new, groundbreaking or interesting, so you can just pass if a pickax-wielding miner impaling people isn't your idea of fun. For the rest of us, it'll be one hell of a ride - it's filmed for 3D viewing, with jawbones and bullets flying out of the screen. The plot is plausible, but nothing new, the characters are fine, the acting is ridiculous and cheesy in some places, but it doesn't spoil anything...All in all, you have to go in expecting either nothing or exactly the kind of movie My Bloody Valentine is. It isn't scary or disturbing in any way, not in the manner of The Exorcist, Session 9 or The Tale of Two Sisters, but more of a thrill-ride. And one of the most fun to grace the theaters in years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reminds us how Slasher flicks should be!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to watch this movie with low expectations because I'm a huge fan of the original; I mean, I grew up watching it and because I read that it had a huge gore factor.The truth is that I ended up having a blast with this gory, entertaining, fast paced, and even intriguing -at some points- slasher flick.So remaking the original was a good idea? Hell yeah! This 2009 version has plenty of beautiful, fun gore that almost made me cry of happiness! Expect some kickass murders including one with a shovel, another that deals with a pickack in the head and chest, ...a naked blonde slut getting slaughtered (NICE!!), and some midget torture; and more nasty ones that I won't tell because I would spoil the action! The plot is very well carried although it won't be difficult for slasher gorehounds to know who's the real killer if you know what I mean.The twist and some situatons made me think of "Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning".So if you are up for a gory, fun, entertaining, and fast paced slasher; please watch this one and you won't be disappointed. I have to recommend it only for slasher fans. Otherwise you could think it's a piece of trash.This is how slashers are done! Special mentions for the great acting this time. The two lead male characters are top notch. But Tom Atkins steals the show as the badass cop and later the retired detective. He kicks ass. While Jaime King proved me wrong when I thought she was a blah actress. She's extremely good looking and delivers a fine performance. Special mention for Megan Boone because of her super sexy body and face. She gave me the hots! This remake is very different from the original so that's a good aspect and I really dug the 80's slasher feeling from it. So please give yourself a favor and don't judge this movie before watching it.Be My Bloody Valentine! Now, that's a phrase I want to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Choice of murderer disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, bloody awesome film! I loved the gore and the general dismemberment, it was refreshing to see a film really pull out the stops. That pickaxe is damn scary when thrown and poked and thrust at you. The bit where he tore the dudes' jaw off... OUCH. Unfortunately, it was completely ruined by Jensen Ackles being chosen as the bad guy at the end... They should have made him more of a nutter and edgier if they wanted to do that. The cop would have been a far more logical choice for many reasons.Jensen just plays too much of a nice guy to all of a sudden try and look bad. At least they could have thrown in some sort of 'ghost of original murderer' possessing him or something, would have made it better. Although Jensen tries to act evil at the end, he doesn't seem to be able to in my opinion.Apart from that, you must see it for the 3D and gore. AWESOME.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy remake, and you don't have to see it in 3D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a general rule, I find Hollywood's current obsession with seemingly remaking every horror movie that was made during the Seventies and Eighties extremely tiresome, mostly because (i.) nearly every remake so far has turned out really badly, and (ii.) although I try not to, I can't help help but feel that the original movies are slightly tarnished by association. Black Christmas (1974) and The Fog (1979) are two of my favourite horror films of all time, but the recent remakes of both movies were truly awful, and are now going to be avoidably hanging around the originals like a nasty smell.The My Bloody Valentine remake was filmed in 3D and was screened as such in some cinemas. However, I saw it 'flat', which I'm actually grateful for. Instead of adding to the movie-going experience, I personally find that 3D effects actually take me out of a film - they're a constant reminder that what I'm seeing is artificial, and so they prevent me from getting involved in the story and the characters.But I'm quite pleased to report as a fan of the original My Bloody Valentine (I wish Paramount would hurry up and release on Region 2 the previously-unseen uncut edition of the film that's available on Region 1) that the remake doesn't disappoint. Yes, in some ways it's inferior to the original, but in others it's actually superior. It's that rare thing - a modern day slasher movie that uses current, up-to-date film-making techniques &amp; cinematic stylistic tricks, while retaining the sensibilities of an authentic Eighties slasher flick (unlike the entries in the post-Scream slasher boom, which had a very different tone to the Eighties slashers that followed in the wake of Halloween). Despite a slightly weak climax, the remake of My Bloody Valentine is a worthy xerox that doesn't disgrace itself or the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of the film is somewhat similar to other horror films with its own plot and twist. I shall not go into details with the story but it's nice to say it kept a group of us guessing right until the closing moments of the films.The special effects were somewhat used in a way which wasn't overpowering to the audience. The 3D was not that spectacular but was very well executed at the end of the film and in other various places.The film does feature some comical moments which i am not sure if they were intended or just happen to appear like this.If you are looking for a decent film to watch at the theatres which you want to make you jump then this could be the one. With its jumpy moments and suspense scenes leaving you on the edge of your seat this will not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a classic 80's slasher... in 3D!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the world of modern day horror, seeing a movie like My Bloody Valentine 3D is especially a treat. It never takes itself too seriously, it has extreme violence and nudity, and it's the most fun I've had in a theater since 2007's Grindhouse, my personal favorite film of all time. It's original in more ways than one while at the same time being a remake. It just feels like one of those classic '80s slasher films that, despite being cheesy as all hell, people love to death. Jensen Ackles, Kerr Smith, and Jaime King star.The gore and special effects are among some of the finest in the genre in recent history. It's just great to see things popping out at you in 3D. It's almost like you can reach out and touch the shovel that a girl is decapitated with. The 3D definitely doesn't make the movie because it's a great one with or without the 3D, but it helps add to the atmosphere and, at times, the gross-out factor. While there were a few scenes here and there where I wish we had been shown a little bit more, it was overall evenly paced. I personally loved the cast because they just made that whole B-movie experience feel more real. The Miner, who is the film's killer, had perfect presence and was just scary enough to carry the film. He just felt like a big brutal dude, and that was more than enough to sell the film for me. Add to the mix a motel-keeping midget, a completely nude chase scene, a cool plot twist, and the gory effects, and you have yourself a nearly perfect horror movie with all the makings of a classic... and this was a remake! My Bloody Valentine doesn't shine with phenomenal acting or note perfect dialogue: what works so well with the movie is its obvious ode to the horror films of yesteryear. It's filled with cheesy dialogue, horror movie clichés, plenty of boobs, and over-the-top gore. That's one of the reasons why it's so perfect, though. It's a cheesy, fun, 80's or 90's movie through and through, never once overestimating the audience or playing pretend. My Bloody Valentine knows what it is. It's a well-made 3D horror movie that aims to entertain, and it never tries to be anything more than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gorefest; don't expect a lot, but don't expect it to fall short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been highly anticipating My Bloody Valentine 3-D ever since it came out. I hadn't seen the original at the time, though I have now, and it seemed to me that at the time the remake was going to be a really fun movie I could enjoyed watching. I finally got to see it and I will say I was pretty satisfied with it, though I shouldn't have hyped it up as much as I did.Well, the downsides are the characters got faceless at times, and the plot wasn't really anything to praise, but mainly this movie was just meant for fun and that's what it is, bloody fun. While the original goes all out on the Valentine's Day feel, this horror event just happens to take place on Valentine's Day, and though it's fun, it does fall under the category of teen slasher, which we all know how those tend to get. If you saw it in theaters, you are bound to appreciate it just a little more, because it makes the movie more thrilling, because there were some 3-D scenes that I enjoyed very much. Overall, My Bloody Valentine 3-D is not a movie you should view expecting the worst or vice versa. Construction-wise it was poor, but still, it entertains, is enjoyable, and has cool death scenes. Give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story was a bit like an old 80s/90s horror - quite predictable, shocking acting and a terrible story.It was like they took a film that no one would go to see and spiced it up with 3d so people would go see it!I wouldn't even rate this film as an 18, it was more like a 15. My opinion is that if you want to see a 3d film, then go and see 'Journey To The Centre Of The Earth'.So disappointed - it is probably one of the worst horror films I have ever seen, and others must have agreed because about 6 other people walked out half way through.Don't go and waste you money on this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Typical 3D Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's nothing better sometimes than a good slasher movie. Sitting back and watching teenagers scream and be hacked to death can be cathartic. Now when you start tacking on the 3D element that goes a step too far for me. 3D is basically a remake of the 1981 My Bloody Valentine. This new incarnation uses many of the same names and even the same mining community is utilized in both. A new series of killings happens to come on the heals of young man coming to town who coincidently left the town at the time of the original killings. He naturally find himself suspected of the murders and it seems like an old girlfriend is the only one that believes him. Did I mention all of this happens on Valentine's Day?Certainly get ready for a blood bath. I think you can tell from the poster that the weapon of choice is a pick ax so it should not be too much of a shock that people are going to be slaughtered with a pick. The pick is used in lots of creative ways. Now I don't want to sound like this is a good movie, it's not. It is a brainless, bloody romp with things pointed at their screen every few seconds to make you jump out of your seat. If drive-ins still dotted our film landscape, this would be the movie of choice. 2/4* *For the movie My Bloody Valentine, the original 1981 version or the 2009 3D version I expect there to be lots of style designed for the poster. This is some good design material. I'm glad that horror movies don't have to take themselves or their posters too seriously. The audience for those films demand to be teased into finally forking their money over to see people hacked to death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A psychological thriller wrapped up in a bloody package with layered performances from Jensen Ackles and Kerr Smith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd never gone to a horror movie before and I never would have ventured into My Bloody Valentine 3D without the promise of another great performance from my favorite actor, Jensen Ackles. I was not disappointed. As a fan of Jensen's talent it was great to watch him on the big screen creating another memorable character, but more importantly for this review, I totally enjoyed all aspects of MBV. I knew there would be blood and gore and I don't think they disappoint, but I was somehow able to distance myself from it as movie effects and concentrate on the story and acting. There were many shocking deaths and gruesome ends and the suspense leading up to them was edge-of-your-seat anticipation which should appeal to the die-hard horror buffs.What most impressed me was the depth of the movie, the strength and cohesiveness of Todd Farmer and Zane Smith's script, and the pacing and vision of Patrick Lussier's direction. You learn all the basic facts of the mine explosion and the resulting deaths in a brilliant opening setup through newspaper headlines and voice-overs. It quickly gives you the information you need in an inventive and visually stunning way before hurling you into the story. The soundtrack throughout the movie helps reinforce the emotions and suspense, punctuating the scenes and making the action even more meaningful.The movie starts with what I imagine is a pretty standard slasher feel, immersing you quickly into the horror, but then it takes a step back and morphs into a real psychological thriller with a tight script expertly presenting several credible suspects for the pickax-wielding killer. There are the inevitable red herrings, but the script rarely cheats, instead laying out all the clues and then twisting and turning the facts until you honestly don't know who the killer is. This is good, suspenseful storytelling and it pulled me into the characters' lives and made me want to know more about them as I awaited the big reveal.I enjoyed the movie so much I've now seen it three times, twice in 3D and once in 2D just to see the difference. I think the movie holds up without the 3D special effects, but if given the choice always go with 3D for that extra dimension. MBV is an exhilarating thrill ride with real substance at its foundation. I found it to be intelligent movie making wrapped up in a bloody package with all the bells and whistles to make it fun. Do be aware there is an extended nude scene, but since the woman didn't seem concerned she was out in public in the buff, I quickly dismissed that aspect and focused on her peril. I think it was inserted to add one more first to the movie's credentials, and I do believe this is a movie with staying power. MBV has all the elements to make it a cult classic.The acting is a major plus with three memorable leads and a fine group of supporting players led by Kevin Tighe and Tom Atkins. Jensen Ackles is the perfect choice to play Tom. Jensen's good looks and easy-going appeal perfectly capture the spirit of the high school golden boy ten years back while his subtle acting expertly conveys the anguish and guilt Tom has felt since making that fateful error. Tom is not Dean Winchester nor any of Jensen's other characters; instead he is a new tormented man living with the ramifications of one tragic mistake.Anyone who watches Supernatural knows how accomplished Jensen is at conveying everything his character is feeling with just his facial reactions and most especially those eyes. He isn't afforded the screen time here that he's used so effectively on Supernatural to show the depth he's layered into Dean over four years of the Winchesters' saga, but he makes the most of the time he has and steadily reveals Tom to us and he does it through small glimpses that define the man and makes us care.As rivals for the heroine's affections, Jensen and Kerr Smith, as Axel, the Sheriff, both do admirable jobs with meaningful glances and the inflections they give their dialogue and are stand-outs in a very capable cast. I wasn't that familiar with Kerr previously, but he has a way of drawing you into his character even when the guy is being the typical jerk. Jaime King, as Sarah, Tom's high school sweetheart and Axel's wife, does a commendable job as the small town girl, facing her first love again and all the lost possibilities while living with an imperfect life with Axel. She is real but isn't the damsel in distress. She shows a basic resilience and I love seeing a strong woman on screen, scared to death but still fighting back. All three actors, Jaime, Kerr, and Jensen sell their parts.No one should know who the killer is before watching the movie and honestly, they could have credibly had several people end up as the killer. The suspense builds to the final climatic confrontation where the viewer is torn trying to piece together the information and determine who the killer is. I love that scene, the acting is stellar, the editing expertly cuts in flashbacks to show how it all came down, and the cinematography and direction enhance the power of the scene. The final reveal is worth the price of admission. Personally, I think they made the perfect choice for the killer and the movie plays out wonderfully.For my first horror movie I found a great one. I've always hated stupid people doing stupid things and getting themselves killed which is how I thought most of these horror movies went, but MBV has proved that to be a false perception. Maybe I'll have to give another horror flick a chance. I hear Friday the 13th is coming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could've been better, but not the worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine 3D was somewhat better then expected, but it wasn't all that when you compare it to some of the older classic horror films. I wouldn't give a thought of seeing it a second time, but there were a few recent horror movies that were worse.This is a remake of and old 80's slasher, something that is being done over and over again, where a miner goes on a rampage after a mine caves in trapping him and others. He kills the other miners and is the only one pulled from the wreckage alive. He wakes up from a coma in a hospital and goes on another rampage where he murders the hospital staff and patients. He returns to the mine where he was trapped, finds teenagers having a party and starts killing them off as well, and through all this I was wondering where the cops were, and why this guy was able to walk free. A few of the teenagers escape, and one in particular named Tom (played by Jensen Ackles from Supernatural on the WB) leaves town to never be heard from again.Ten years pass, and Tom finally does return to sell the mine because it was his fathers, making him the major share holder. Just as he returns there is another murder spree. THere are a few suspects, but he becomes the primary one, and so My Bloody Valentine follows the predictable slasher genre to a T except it is in 3D.The 3D wasn't bad in the movie, but I still say it could've been a little more creative. THere are a few nice kills, and one of the best is a pick ax thrown at a pick-up truck early in the film. Another clever one involves a pick-ax to the face which sends the blood spraying up and at the viewer.THe acting for the most part was what you would expect in a horror slasher film. It wasn't quite as bad as some B-films, but it wasn't really that good either. I guess I would say it is passable for a movie of this type but nothing special.There are some surprises other than the gore, which this movie has a lot of, but nothing to really impress or shock. There wasn't a lot of suspense either. I would rate Valentine a 6 out of 10, but if not for the 3D it would likely be more like a 5 out of 10. It is nothing to really spend twelve dollars on.</fullReview>

I must state the fact now that this film doesn't really have that much of a story, it's a 3D film that just plays on the 3D of trying to tell a story and fails unfortunately. On a second note the acting is pretty good, actually it's really good, if you enjoy films literally in your face in 3D then go and watch this film, if you enjoy a deep story then don't go and see this film but then again if you enjoy gore and great special effects this is the one for you.

		<fullReview>After I got over the 3d, it really was a wrap. I haven't seen the original, but upon viewing, it seems like it was your run-of-the-mill slasher. If your looking for innovation (not including 3-d) good acting, and a good story line, your in the wrong place. The writing was incredibly lazy, and the 'twist' at the end smacked of laziness. It's obvious that the 3d was the main selling point and to heck with everything else. The cliché's from 70's and 80's horror films come think and fast to the point it's beyond a joke. You'd think after 4 scary movie films, writers of horrors would try and deviate from the 'falling over when being chased' 'going to a dark place alone to investigate a noise' 'lets split up' clichés that have existed in horrors since the beginning of time, but nope, laziness is still alive and well in 2009.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I figured after the gimmicky-corporate ads and trailers that this movie was just going to be a cut out remake with no chance. However, when I sat down to watch this film, I was truly blown away! Every one of killings had a ballet sequence to them that was both mesmerizing and terrifying. With human body parts flying out you here and there, it's hard to underestimate the clichéd horror story. I think most of MBV's success, however, should go to the 3D features; it made watching pretty intense. Kerr Smith was a believable sheriff and Jamie King was fitting for that staggering caught in a love triangle damsel in distress. Jensen Ackles fans would have a field with this movie as it truly showcased his acting chops. This film definitely was definitely a step up from his role in Supernatural. I would recommend this movie to anyone with an interest in a good slasher movie thrill ride with great 21th century effects. It is suspensing, engaging, and will leave you with a head rush all the way up to the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Problem With the Modern Slasher Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By all means, this movie should have been the resurrection of the slasher movie in the post-Scream world. One of the most underrated horror movies of the 80's gets an update with a decent budget, a studio willing to go wild with the blood, gore, and nudity, and all of it presented in modern digital 3D. Unfortunately the movie commits the 3 cardinal sins that bar entry into slasher movie paradise.One, the movie emphasizes plot when there really isn't one. Plot comes second to character in a movie like this, you can't ask an audience to empathize with a serial killer while he butchers cardboard characters with no personality. The audience wants to know who to root for and who to root against. A serial killer with little ambiguous background is much more terrifying (just ask Michael Myers.) This brings me to number two, NO ONE NEEDS A MUSICAL CUE TO KNOW WHEN TO BE SCARED! If you need a loud trumpet blast to get the audience to jump you know you are doing something wrong. This was figured out 29 years ago back when Sean Cunningham and company made Friday the 13th (they specifically stated that they were not going to dupe the audience with music to let them know when to be scared, they wanted to earn it.) Lastly, the 3D is underutilized. With today's technology, 3D is amazing. There is such more potential for it then just throwing objects at the screen (which admittedly is still cool.) The digital 3D technology truly immerses the audience in the movie, it's like a play being performed right in front of you. The potential for suspense is almost incomprehensible if this were utilized correctly, unfortunately the camera work is shoddy at best, relying on close ups of the actors which is easily 3D's least beneficial factor. The only reason this movie is redeeming in the slightest is because the 3D is so amazing, and the death scenes are admittedly rather jaw dropping. I think they could have used more variety, but when you are being sprayed with blood in the safety of a movie theatre seat, its easy to forget how inept the rest of the film is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than I Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, let me first admit two very important truths about myself: 1) I hate scary movies. I usually cover my eyes during the gory parts and get nightmares from the scary parts (The Grudge previews on TV gave me nightmares for weeks) 2) I am a HUGE fan of Jensen Ackles (played Tom), and will therefore see ANYTHING he is in - even if it is a scary, gory, 3D death-fest.That said, you realize the state of mind I was in when I went to go see MBV3D. However, I took a (more gutsy) friend, and together we stomached the movie.Overall, I thought this was a pretty decent film. It wasn't as gory as I thought it was going to be, which for ME sends the rating HIGHER (though I know that would ruin it for others), and of course, Jensen Ackles looked dead sexy. The story was sort of compelling, although the twist at the end I had already figured out just from seeing the posters and watching the trailers. I couldn't keep any of the girls straight though, they were all screechy and irritating and looked pretty much the same.Overall, no, it's NOT the gretest movie ever, and I'm not going to pretend that it is. There are parts that are over-the-top and/or kind of cheesy, but I enjoyed myself, and I'd watch it again willingly. Just take it for what it is and don't hope for anything too spectacular, and you'll have fun. ~ Jay Ross-Tristan</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vision that naturally lives up to the hype.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of 3D has been around since the early nineteen twenties, which has more than one process for the 3D effect: Anaglyphic, Polarized and Lenticular. Whichever process used, the overall effect can replicate the image from the third dimension to reproduce the illusion of depth for the cinemagoer. The original process from camera to screen is done with what is called a Natural Vision Camera, two lenses which sit next to each other on one camera, filming from two differing viewpoints, i.e., similar to the natural vision of the eye. Then when projected across the auditorium two separate pictures from two projectors are used to superimpose the image onto a reflective screen. The final process is seeing the reflective image through Polaroid glasses, which in turn gives the viewer that feeling of being amongst the action.A move away, the costly and limited Cinerama and its huge three curved screens that best exploits peripheral vision, one advantage here is the lack of Polaroid glasses, along with CinemaScope, too, was to give the cinemagoer the sense of depth and to enhance to feeling of actually "being there". This, and the new sound of stereo, was what the major studios wanted to use to keep the cinema audiences from straying too far from Cinema thus preventing them staying home and watching movies on the new invention, television. It was the Independent movie Bwana Devil (1952) being the first film to be shot using the new doubled lens Natural Vision Camera, showing it could be done, the major studios' soon followed suit.The new millennium has continued to exploit this novelty, this gimmick, to its full potential, and the latest film from Loinsgate, the Canadian Independent production and Distribution Company, has not failed in its role to replicate real life on the Silver Screen. A Mr. Nasty who after killing his work colleagues while trapped in a crumbled mineshaft then goes on a killing spree in the small mining town of Harmony, twenty years later, he returns, to kill once more. A little formalistic in its delivery but it means well and works fine, for what it is and its limitations. It is a "teen slasher / spatter" movie after all. Patrick Lussier's remake of the 1981 film of the same name has some great moments of suspense and shock, but this is very much expected. As for originality, it is pretty much money for old rope, full frontal nakedness, heads-a-rolling, girls-a-screaming and plenty of lovely death. The fact is, that this is just a basic horror flick, which would not really go a miss on any midnight showing on any T.V. Horror Channel, is no great loss to the genre.The redeeming factor here is the charm of its pulling power: 3D. Yes, this tried and tested, old, genre has resurfaced, like the dreaded masked killer Harry Warden, to throw, literally, the odd pickaxe and body-parts into the faces of this new generation of cinema-goers'. We should really know what to expect here in this type of movie. No excuses. The point of the matter is if one wants to be "spat upon", "stand next to someone while having their face pulled-off" or be in the same room with a "leaving nothing, at all, to the imagination naked lady" and having to "dodge a bullet", amongst other things, then this is the film for you. Fun, enjoyable, different but predicable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine 3D, a remake of a slasher film from the early 1980's, doesn't pretend to be more than it actually is. Which is a horror movie chock full of blood and gore, made on the cheap with the intention to demonstrate the innovations of the newest 3D technology that's being used in movie theaters.The rating represents the movie as viewed in 3D. It's fun and kind of thrilling in a novel sort of way to watch a horror movie in 3D while wearing 3D glasses. 3D technology today is different than it was in the past. Although not perfect, it's far more effective.The movie probably wouldn't be worth watching if not viewed in 3D. The scenes consisting of boring exposition, horrible dialog, bad acting and a trite horror plot filled to the brim with familiar horror conventions and clichés are enough to turn away anyone but, the most hardcore slasher fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great 80s style horror, but faster!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen the reviews of this film, I was seriously not expecting it to be any good at all. However it is a great film, if you like the old 80s style horror movies. I thoroughly enjoyed it and have watched it may times, and still enjoy it! If you are expecting a saw type horror, then this isn't for you! If you like Nightmare on Elm Street type films, then I think you would like this.The 3D was brilliant. I watched it with my projector on a 92" screen and the effects are very good.I'm forever bemoaning the fact that there are so many horror remakes (reimagining)being made. Most if not all unnecessary in my view. But something strange happened when I watched this? I was truly blown away. I can honestly say that I enjoyed this more than the original. This had everything I want from a slasher film. A high body count, over-the-top gore, graphic violence, gratuitous female nudity, humour and bad acting. But what was most important about this was the fact it was entertaining and fun. Don't expect to get any deep character development, the pace of this film doesn't allow for that. This cuts to the chase and gets down and dirty. Blood, gore and obliteration by pick-axe are the order of the day. A big thumbs-up to film-makers who have concocted many interesting and imaginative deaths involving a pick-axe. Big kudos also have to go to Betsy Rue, Her short scene manages to be sexy, hilarious and scary all at the same time. Oh and she is completely naked throughout. At the end of the day this is a cheesy, brainless homage to '80s slashers. But it knows it and never tries to be anything more than that. It truly was an enjoyable experience to watch. So if you're a fan of trashy slashers, I highly recommend you see this. And look out for Tom Atkins as Sheriff Jim Burke. Nice to see him back in a horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A throwback to 1980s slasher movies done right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film paying homage to other films or filmmakers is nothing new in the world of making movies. The work of Alfred Hitchcock, especially films like 'Psycho' and 'The Birds' have been paid tribute to, seriously or in the form of parody, countless times in several mediums. Classic monsters like Dracula and The Wolf Man have been brought back again and again for each generation. Slasher films however have not always been around, instead really coming into existence in the late 1960s to early 70s. Sure some like 'Halloween' may have been influenced by Hitchcock's 1960 classic, but none were full-fledged revivals of a genre movement. With the resurgence of Horror films after the success of 'Scream' we started seeing ones that were in the spirit of those we know and love from back in the day. 'My Bloody Valentine 2009' isn't just a remake, but also a real tribute to the films of that period.Pros: Cast is game. Many memorable kills. More than enough blood and gore to satisfy. Great job done on the effects. Fast paced. Terrifying villain. Good score that really gets the blood pumping. Doesn't take itself too seriously. A pretty good twist.Cons: Not much on plot. No one expects great acting in these movies, but there are a few pretty bad moments. The one on the bridge between two of the leads is especially cringe worthy. Lacking suspense. A little unnecessary padding.Final thoughts: This was the first slasher film since 'Friday the 13th part 3' to be in 3D and one hopes that it'll be worth it. I'm happy to report that it is, but also that the film can be enjoyed without it as well. The people responsible obviously have great affection for these kind of movies and did a great job of respecting the original and the sub-genre. This could have been a very teenybopper kind of film like some that came in the wake of 'Scream,' but instead it's like a fun, gory 1980s slasher set in the present.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that won't break the hearts of horror fans everywhere!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So after wondering what I should be watching, I saw My Bloody Valentine which didn't disappoint and it was in 3D too which made the movie even more brilliant. After a decade when miner Harry Warden goes on a killing spree with a pickaxe, guilt-stricken Tom (Jensen Ackles) returns to his little hometown only to find that similar murders has started happening. With Warden believed to be long dead, Sheriff Axel doesn't shy away from suspecting Tom. It seems that only Tom's ex, Sarah, is the only one who believes he is innocent.Horror fans will seriously be impressed with this scary movie as almost everything about it had the ingredients to make a perfect horror movie as there were plenty of jumps, blood, running and screaming. The story is taken from the original movie (which I have not seen so I can not comment on whether this version actually keeps to the original) and is a very good solid story. The movie is constantly dark and dim which really kept to the atmosphere and the feel of the movie. The actors and actresses should give themselves a round of applause as they played their characters terrifically and also the direction of the movie was very well-done. The locations and soundtrack also gave the movie an extra eerie kick, though there was no need for it as the movie gave out plenty of eerie moments and it didn't rely heavily on blood and gore which I'm happy about since most horrors in the present day do just that. The style on which the movie is done is like a mixture between the 80s Halloween and Scream, you have some blood here and there but it's all about the scare factor and not the gross-out factor.The 3D effects were absolutely amazing and I would urge anyone who likes 3D and horror movies to watch this. I don't actually have much criticism for this movie as I think mostly positive but sometimes I was a little bored. Don't get me wrong- the movie was great and in 3D, it's even better but there were two or three long scenes in the movie where you wouldn't miss anything from the story if it was cut out.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is weak. Scenes just move from one to another without much logical sequence.The killings are repetitive and there isn't much tension before each one - except at the supermarket. Gore without thrill is what you have.Jensen Ackles isn't very expressive. Kerr Smith looks tired. The girls Megan and Sara look a bit alike and it's confusing. You don't get to know the characters before they are killed. The ending is silly - showing very little explanation why the killer is the killer. The red herrings to distract you along the way are silly.Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>See the original one from 1981 if you have a pick.This one (the 2009 remake) is a 3D gimmick rehash. The story of both are similar. However the original version is much better made. The killings and the suspense are way better. This one is hard to take seriously. It has some flashy camera works but that's all. The actors are not amazing. The editing is okay and fluid but it can't save the movie. The best part was the opening titles with all the newspaper stuff. After that it was just one disappointment after another.

		<fullReview>I would compare this movie to I know what you did last summer. I think they're on same caliber. I like both films. My Expectations met by this movie. It is different from other suspense thriller film. People were brutally murdered. Nude Girl running from death. The Valentine idea was brilliant. Although it has numerous killings of people, they still able to insert romances in some scenes.I got confused whose really the killer, Jansen and Kerr were the suspect, I just thought it wasn't TOM because he wouldn't kill SARAH her ex-girlfriend, on way to the end, My suspicion went to the Black Sheriff Guy and I was wrong. Its really a good horror suspense movie, it kinda reminded me of I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER.BTW, I like the mask that killers' wearing, its scary enough and it leaves the audience clueless. I also like the continuous breathing of the killer, it adds up to the thrill of the movie.The lead actors are good looking, that's all I could say. I would recommend this movie, its worth watching for.+++</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title doesn't make you run out to the movies to see it, unless your slasher junkie. And I used to be, with the likes of Scream and it's sequels. But in time I grew up, and thought, eh, not really my style so much these days, so I won't bother to go out of my way to watch them.This movie first of all, came as a complete shock to me. It really had me guessing right up to the very end. I like movies that I can't figure out who it was. Every time I thought I knew who it was, then that person died. (Hope that wasn't a spoiler, yeah people die.) The creative ways that they film makers used to kill people off with a Pick Axe were sometimes quite original.Of course you still have the moments when people act stupid, and fall over when running, or the killer cant see them when they are right next to them, but it all adds to the fun, and the movie doesn't take itself seriously which makes it better. Nothing worse than a serious horror movie.I liked it, well worth watching it in 3D. Probably still like it if it wasn't in 3D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this is by far the most enjoyable horror film so far in 2009, without a doubt. And by far the best slasher film to come out in a couple years. With that said, don't watch it without the 3D gimmick in play.The plot is pretty much the standard slasher plot, but with the characters actually trying to figure out what's going on. That in itself should gain recognition. I've seen this movie twice. In the theaters I loved it because the 3D effects were so amazing and fun. Then I saw it on DVD and my opinion was lowered because I saw all the flaws.In 3D, you don't care about the plot or anything else. You just want to see people get mutilated in all three dimensions, but in 2D, it's just not as fun. It's just gory and not much else.I'd watch it again because, as a horror movie, it's pretty good. It's slightly smarted than average horror, but, still, it's over-the-top attitude, while refreshing at first, kind of gets old after a while. Oh, yeah, and in 3D it's pretty damn scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ten years after a murderous coal miner murdered 22 people before being done in himself by local law enforcement, a small town is again plagued by vicious killings by a maniac dressed in a coal miners uniforms &amp; mask, but who could the killer be? one of his potential victims from 10 years ago, now just returning back to town? The new sheriff? or did the original killer (whom the authorities claim is dead) the culprit? MY BLOODY VALENTINE 3D is a rarity as I said in my summary above, a film that actually surpasses it's original (though it is arguable I suppose) why I say that is that you can really see that unlike most remakes, this film wasn't made to be put out there in order to capitalize on the (sadly) remake craze &amp; makes tons of money, but that the film was made (just like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 03'/DAWN OF THE DEAD 04/THE HILLS HAVE EYES 06' &amp; WILLARD 03') for the love of the genre, everything that made the slasher films of yesteryear so memorable &amp; so great &amp; so much fun is here, the pointless nudity, the gore, the awesome kills (spectacularily done in 3D!) the suspense &amp; tension the good acting &amp; directing (okay well maybe the last two weren't always that prevalent back then) the story is faster &amp; better executed &amp; the film is a must see for slasher fans, after seeing this, RED MIST (A.K.A. FREAK DOG) &amp; LAID TO REST (&amp; hopefully their will be more in 2009) my faith in the genre is finally being restored! Highly recommended to slasher fans wanting to have a good time, further proof that their are still dedicated &amp; loyal horror fans in the film industry &amp; not someone just their to cash in a check (sadly their seems to be more of these than the former).**** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent remake. In both 2-D and 3-D!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Warden, kills a group of miners after an accident, then kills a group of teens, after waking from a coma, before his apparent death. Now years later, Tom Hanniger, a survivor of the original killings, and partially responsible for the original accident, returns to the town to sell the mine, just as Harry Warden appears to returned from the dead to resume killing........I don't remember that much about the original in truth. I saw it years ago, and thought it was an okay slasher movie, even though most of the violence had been edited out by the censors. I have to say though, that this remake is quite well done.It is just as much a who-is-it? movie as a slasher. In a way that is a throwback the original slashers. They used to have that aspect in some of them. And the writers to their credit do keep you guessing right up to the end.Patrick Lussier, handle the material well, and does generate a couple of good shocks, and keeps things moving at a brisk pace. It is exciting if not particularly scary, a common fault in the majority of modern horror movies.The cast, a mix of young and old actors are all good, generating the right amount of terror in their performances.But the real reason for seeing this movie is the 3D aspect, and in this it works very well. Even though it does have the usual 'pointing out things towards the camera scenes' there are moments when you will feel like ducking in your seat as things come towards you! What is surprising however, is how well the movie works in a flat 2-D version. Although there are a couple of effects that are more obvious in 2-D than 3-D, the lack of the 3-D aspect doesn't affect the enjoyment of the movie.Obviously, it is a better movie in 3-D. But if you can't see it in this form then don't despair. It works just as well in the flat version too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reviving the Third Dimension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(SPOILERS!) In this age of cinematic recycling, the Sixty-Million Dollar-Opening-Weekend Question is: what does it take to draw attention to a remake, especially when horror remakes are the most consistently (and cynically) manufactured, and subsequently forgotten? Director Patrick Lussier answers that question with his revision of 1981's "My Bloody Valentine": film it in 3-D to the fullest extent of the medium; there's nary a frame in this re-imagining where something isn't jutting out or being propelled toward the viewer. That aspect alone makes MBV3D worthwhile for horror fans who miss the days of Freddy and Jason menacing the audience in three dimensions (despite one-dimensional scripts). To his credit, Lussier and screenwriters Todd Farmer and Zane Smith have created a decent story that pays homage to its parent, but covers enough new terrain to make it of interest to fans of the good?but mostly forgotten?original. The characters are drawn beyond mere pickax fodder, and several setpieces (particularly one in a deserted grocery store) deliver as much on suspense as gory payoff. While MBV3D tries to pull off a twist ending like its predecessor, the result is a case of split-personality schizophrenia that really hasn't been inspired since "Fight Club" set the precedent a decade ago. Still, for those who like their gore explicit, served up with a side of full-frontal female nudity, MBV works?but only in three dimensions.</fullReview>

Furthermore, I was a little put out when I found out that it is a remake from the 1981 film of the same name. However, from the first few minutes, I was hooked, especially with the hospital scene.I managed to call the entire plot line about a third of the way into the movie, but each scene was well-crafted enough to keep me guessing. Later, I found out that the killer in the 2009 version is different from the 1981 movie. Personally, it didn't bother me too much, and I'm especially glad they cut out the "Sarah, won't you be my bloody valentine?" from the original. That particular nugget of '80s corniness was not needed and I would have probably cried.What I liked the most was the careful balance of the elemental aspects of movie that are true to any good slasher film: 20% plot, 80% BOOGA-BOOGA scare moments, and 500% blood, gore, death and destruction, and of course an unexpected ten-minute porn scene. I, personally, could have done without it, but you have to raise box office sales somehow. And there was much rejoicing and fapping to boot. Hey-oh! On a fan-girlish side-note, Jensen Ackles is DAMN. FINE. Of course, I grew up with him when he was Eric Brady on Days of Our Lives about ninety trillion years ago. In any case, much of my movie enjoyment came from him and his talent and dashingly handsome features. Oh, and his acting was very good, too.In short, My Bloody Valentine is a must-see for any horror/slasher fan and has thoroughly restored my faith in the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the first truly good remakes, and great throwback to the slashers of the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was Valentine's night, love was in the air and the teens were out at a party drinking and making love. Harry Worden, however, has different plans for them. That night he brutally slaughters 22 people after waking from a coma that was the result of a horrible mining accident. Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles), his girlfriend Sarah (Jaime King) and Axel Palmer (Kerr Smith) were the survivors of that grisly night in which they saw all their friends pickaxed. Ten years later and the town has tried to move on, but Tom returns to sell his father's mine and coincidentally enough people start gruesomely dying one by one, and all eyes our on Tom.Does that plot sound familiar? Well, sure, this is a remake of the 1981 movie of the same name, and this plot is practically the exact same. However, all the slashers from that time had the same plot layout that involved: 1. a horrific murder on a special night, 2. a survivor, or people who remember it and 3. a 10/20/30 year anniversary party which results in the killer/copycat returning to prevent celebrations. The Prowler is a shining example. Other ingredients were/are: a large bodycount, nubile young teens willing to show off their goods, maybe some drugs here and there and lastly (and most importantly), plenty of blood and gore.Director Patrick Lussier has stayed very faithful to this formula, delivering buckets of blood and a nice lashing of nudity. In the first 10 minutes we see hearts in chocolate boxes, bodies that have been cut in half, pickaxes being shoved through skulls and a shovel being lodged into a woman's mouth. Oh, and this is all in glorious 3D! To be perfectly honest, this movie is truly amazing in 3D, I mean, it still would be entertaining in 2D, but the 3D adds so much fun! Eyes and jaws are thrown our way, pickaxes and guns are pointed at us and we can not forget the 7 minutes of a fully naked woman running from the maniac. My Bloody Valentine is pure entertainment, it is not made to win awards, but entertain the audience. The acting is good from all involved, Ackles, King and Smith are great leads, with great support from horror veteran Tom Atkins. Although the story is predicable it is still passable for a modern slasher remake, with a twist most would see coming.The original film was great fun, and much like this, delivered a fast-paced story with brutal mayhem (it was good to see Lussier reference the original in a few scenes). This is highly recommended for fans of the original, or slashers in general, just don't expect it to change the genre! 3?/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the 3D was just a cheap gimmick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK before i start let me say that it's almost 2 in the morning and kind of tired, but i wanted to get this of my chest while the movie was still fresh in my mind. So forgive me if this makes no sense.I am a huge fan of horror films and have seen plenty of slashers over the years, (although there are still tons more that i have to check out) but this has to be one of the worst slashers i have ever seen. I saw the original mbv a few years ago and don't quite remember it too well, so don't think that I'm hating just because I'm hung up on the original. I understand that quality acting is never a big part in any slasher but this is Ridiculous, i have seen better acting in a F13 sequel. The acting was absolutely horrendous. The story was line was paper thin at best and it had one of the worst twists i have ever seen.The 3D did absolutely nothing to better the film, it was just a cheap gimmick used so it distract people from seeing how bad the movie really is.My rating for this would have to be 3/10. While the story was clichéd, dumb and pointless, the gore and TNA managed to keep my attention. rent the original instead.I dunno about anyone else but the 3D also kinda hurt my eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, This movie was awesome and 3D. Lionsgate was the perfect company to host this horror masterpiece, but i would of thought that Paramount would of done this movie, since they did the original. This was the perfect movie to go see on a date. My Bloody Valentine had murder scenes in it like i've never seen before. I was excited for each chase and attack scene. I have the 1981 My Bloody Valentine and they are both kick ass horror films. I was really impressed with the cast of My Bloody Valentine, especially Jaime King (The Tripper and White Chicks), she is an outstanding actress, so i definitely urge you to check this sweet film out!! Jensen Ackles and Kerr Smith were great and Betsy Rue and Megan Boone were sexy as ever. My Bloody Valentine focuses on the dark side of Valentines Day about a mysterious killer returning to town, after being presumed dead for many years. So take your ate to see this flick and you'll never look at Valentine's Day the same again, because there's nothing sweet about it. Enjoy!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent remake. Although I would really like to have Jensen's character be switched with Kerr Smith's sheriff character. Jensen does not suit well as a villain. This is your usual slasher flick and a very gory one for that matter. The film's very visual with its murder scenes and there's even a hint of nudity. Characterization could have been improved by making Jensen's character look older. Since the big chunk of the movie took place 10 years after the original killing. I was expecting some changes on the actors appearance, but it looks like Kerr Smith's character was the only one who got older. The rest of the cast looks the same as years before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>congrats to Lionsgate for making a horror movie with definite appeal to Gay patrons like myself.The two male leads were to die for and I could while away the minutes between gory killings with fantasies of a more intimate kind.Thanks also for the shoulder stitching scene!I have to admit to checking this out to see how far the 3D process has progressed. Pleased to report that it was thoroughly entertaining although there was a slight sense of shooting things in three planes, foreground...e.g grills, mid focus for the people and backgrounds (blurred)Reminding me a bit of those 3D wildlife cards you used to get in serial packets.Plot line was fine, although absolutely nothing made me jump out of my seat..and I am a real wuss.Heres to hoping that Lionsgate will allow me to fulfil my fantasy and remake that other great 70s 3d classic "Heavy Equipment"cmon Lionsgate....what do you say?????Oh well....and congrats to the male lead for doing such a superb Jeff Stryker impersonation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Expectations that were Granted!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, hands down, was great.Leading into it I had high expectations, I was really excited to see it. The last time I saw a 3d movie before this one was probably 10 years + ago, and I'm glad that I saw another one. I had high expectations because it was 3D, and from the previews looked pretty good.When I first started watching the movie I was like "wow, look at the those wheel screw things for Lionsgate's entrance into the movie." It looked so cool, they literally were coming out at you. The last time I saw a 3d movie was Life on Mars, or something like that. I didn't have much to brag about it being in 3D, it wasn't good. But the way this movie used the 3d format was awesome. I remember watching several parts where things were popping completely out at you, and you had to jump a little bit. I recommend getting as close to the screen as possible for maximum experience.Now, even though there was awesome 3d parts, there were still other parts that I was thinking "what was the point of that part." Some parts were kind of dumb and didn't need the 3d effect they tried to pull off. This is probably the only complaint I have with the 3D use.Yes, the 3d parts, 95% of them were awesome, however, the most important part of any movie, 3D or not, is the acting. Also, since this was a horror film it's gotta be scary. Both lived up to the hype. Instead of using terrible teenage actors(except slightly at the beginning, but they were good young actors), the actors were mature, and knew exactly what to do in order to make the film scary. I couldn't even tell you how many times I jumped, it had to be at least 8. That's more than any other movie, and I don't get scared easily. The acting was good, and it made me jump several times. The suspense too, was intense and powerful! Lastly, the plot was great. I really liked how later in the movie they had you thinking about what was really going on, and who the bad guy was. Was it really Harry? Or was it someone else trying to discover the mysteries of him? I'm not gonna wreck it for you, but the outcome is great, although it was drawn out a bit.In conclusion, the movie was awesome, and in so many aspects. Most of the 3d was mastered to perfection, they didn't use stupid, horrible acting younglings or teenagers, the plot was spectacular, and the movie scared me. I actually got scared. That doesn't happen too often to me w/ scary movies and is rare to come across a good one.Well, go see the movie, and stop reading reviews, -jbujwit</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch Out for the Nut and His Trusty Pick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an entertaining flick. The story line was fairly simple but you don't know for sure who the bad guy is until the very end. Meanwhile you are treated to brutal killing after brutal killing as the crazed miner everyone thought was dead and buried comes back to life and kills again. The spree coincides with the return of a young man who's been gone for ten years and everyone assumes it's his fault no matter how much he denies any responsibility. His name is Tom and the sheriff has it in for him because his wife used to be in love with him. The fact that his old man owned the mine that keeps the town alive might have played a role in her choice of love interests. Viewers are the only ones who know that Tom is a nice guy wrongly accused because we witness the real murderer going after him more than once. And we watch some very creative killings, too. The psycho's primary weapon is a pick, which he uses to lethal effect, swinging it through torsos and into heads with equal abandon, putting a sudden end to the pointless lives of his victims -- anyone associated with the mine. Then he tears their bodies open to cut out their hearts.The most memorable death occurs at the beginning of the flick in a flashback to the original killings. We are told that the killer survived a cave-in at Tunnel #5 by murdering his fellow miners who were using up the scarce oxygen. He wakes up at the hospital and kills everyone he comes across, then goes back to the mine and kills his way through a large group of teens who were dumb enough to have a party there. While butchering these naive young fools one by one, he fends off a sudden attack with a shovel by a spirited blonde, yanking the implement out of her hands, then shoving the blade of it into her mouth. She's standing there looking goggle-eyed, with the shovel protruding from her mouth. Then he pushes the blade home against a supporting beam and the bottom of her head drops to the ground with the rest of her lifeless body. The top of her head, however, is still sitting on the blade of the shovel. It's a great scene. In another scene, the killer rams his trusty pick up through this old guy's jaw and the point of the pick emerges from his mouth. He puts his foot against the guy's chest and yanks his jaw right out of his face along with some other grisly matter. The 3-D effect comes in handy here as gore is sent slapping toward the viewer. Besides these, there are several other instances of extremely effective use of 3-D. You've simply got to see this gore-fest to appreciate the lively imagination and creativity involved in its production. Others have complained about the short nude scene, calling it gratuitous. I disagree. In fact, a little more of the same, utilizing the talents of the film's other attractive actresses, would have made it an even more entertaining movie. The new theater in town sent us free passes in the mail and it was a fun evening, for we don't usually watch horror films and had never before seen a 3-D movie. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad movie in 3D is...a still a bad movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a kid I went on the "Honey I Shrunk The Kids!" ride at Disney world. It was in 3d, and it freaked me out. I distinctly remember propeller blades being inches from my eyes, or at least it looked that way. Effects were use to make you feel like rats were crawling under your feet or the room was on fire, and something was always an inch away from your eyes. That's what 3d is about. "My Bloody Valentine" should have had those things.Watching this movie is more like reading a comic book in 3d. I read a few of those as a kid. They were nothing special. The effects do work at times. In almost any shot you get a real sense of three dimensions. It's almost like being in the movie. You can clearly the see how far away one character is standing from another character. In the background you can see the distance between certain objects such as a tree or a car. I went into this movie expecting things to fly at my face. That's why 3d movies are great. There are a few effects like that involving a pick axe, an eye ball, and a tree branch, but not enough of them.Would this be a good movie in 2d? Not at all. In 2d, it belongs on the shelf at your local Blockbuster. It's a standard slasher film structured like a "whodunit" murder mystery that you cant figure out because the script constantly throws red herrings at you. The final revelation and the lame ending that follows is sure to have the audience throwing their glasses at the screen.Most of the scenes involve uninteresting characters going on about the typical small town drama, then a guy dressed like a miner tears them to pieces with a pick axe and removes there hearts. And that choice of weaponry is just as boring and lame as a knife. If I was making a horror movie I'd give the killer an AK-47. Did guns stop being scary? At the end there is one great special effect that combines computers and 3d like magic. A bullet flies out of a gun and hits its target. It's predictable and clichéd but it's the only good effect in the movie. Plenty of guns are fired. Why did they wait until the last minute to use this effect? Why was this movie made? It's sad that a major studio would take an obscure slasher film from 1981, remake it with no respect for the source material, and slap lame 3d effects on it. The laziness applied to this project it's perfectly parallel to the downfall of the horror genre as a whole. The bait of a 3d experience will lure people into seeing this movie and I hope they realize that a bad movie is no better in 3d.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a horror flick chick myself, but I really enjoyed MBV 3D. I would think that seeing it in 3D is an important feature, because I particularly liked the scenes filmed in the mines and the alley. It was creepier since the 3D made you feel like you were right there!! In fact in the 1 alley scene I tried to lean forward to look around the corner myself! I also concur that the "whodunnit" aspect was well done, and the 3 main actors completely sold it. Jensen Ackles is so good looking, but he can turn on the scary intensity and totally changes in the blink of an eye! Whew! It was a fun ride!! I guess I'll be better prepared now for the remake of Friday the 13th! Bring on the horror!</fullReview>

There are so many reasons people should go see this not only because of how amazing the 3D was but because of how NOT serious this movie takes itself! First of all you cannot go into a movie with high hopes especially with a title like "My Bloody Valentine", secondly if you've seen the original you will notice that the acting was HORRIBLE and the movie NEVER took itself too seriously either. First of all, the movie starts of pretty violent from the get-go, and the best part, it doesn't let up for more than a 5 or so minutes at a time! You're never bored with the acting because of how laughable the lines are, the deaths are always different (except one or two of course). If you're going to see this go in expecting nothing but pure gory fun! This movie (in my opinion) deserves far more than 10 stars. I give it 12 out of 10, just for throwing in some of the most imaginative deaths involving a pick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(rubs temple) oh dear. My bloody valentine 3-D (sighs) OK, here we go. One of the very first horror movies me and my friend saw together was the original My bloody valentine. So we thought it would be appropriate to see the new one in theaters. However that's like saying on the day you met your friend you got kicked in the nuts, so a year later you want to recreate the same scenario. The old one was crappy, but this brings crap to a whole new level. what level would that be you ask? why 3-D of course!! Well as they say, let's take a bite right in. Firstly, it starts off with a miner who survived a cave in and then preceded to kill his four miner friends that were stuck in there with him to save the oxygen. He's rescued, put in a hospital where he proceeds to kill people in the hospital in pretty damn disgusting ways. He then dons his miner suit and as there's a party in the mine he REALLY RANDOMLY pops out of nowhere and kills a whole bunch of kids. yep, the awesome part is pretty much in the beginning of the movie. It gets pretty gruesome, but it's not too gross yet. It looks like he's going to kill the main character but OH! here comes the sheriff (why is it never the police in these movies?) and they shoot at him...but they miss because they suck. fast forward to ten years later.Most people have gotten on with their lives except for.....well the girls. 1 girl got knocked up and is working at a supermarket while the other is a hooker. awesome career choices. the one guy who left his friend became the new sheriff and the kid who lived is now a drifter. now to clarify, when i say kid i mean the exact same actor as supposedly ten years ago but wearing a different shirt. great makeup guys. then out of nowhere the miner is back! oh noez! and he kills the slut and a trucker. and a midget. yes. he kills a midget. following this there's a whole "Who's the killer" thing going back and forth that i honestly didn't care too much about because the characters were so full of whine and angst that i just couldn't give a crap. after a whole bunch of old people get killed, oh, i forgot to mention. The drifter kid is back because he's going to sell the mine. but everyone's against it! "how dare you sell this mine that was the site to a collapse, death of 4 miners and then the site of a mass murder! how DARE you!" anyway the old people start getting killed pretty nastily (including the guy from halloween 3. i have to admit that was rather amusing) and at some points i must say, i looked away going "ewwww". But that doesn't say anything. gore does not make a good movie. anywho, we learn the killer is the drifter kid. despite the fact that there's a part in the movie where if he was really the killer there's no way he could have locked himself inside a cage, sealing it with the murder weapon and all of a sudden it vanishing into thin air. if we ignore that LITTLE oversight, maybe. and by little, i mean gaping plot hole that i could shove horatio from CSI Miami into. and of course, the murderer gets away after the sheriff and his shoprite wife beat him. leaving room for a sequel which lord knows shouldn't happen, but will. Overall, the movie was stupider than the original. it was gorier, the characters were not interesting at all, and i'd rather watch the original, and that's saying something considering i didn't even LIKE the original. the only thing that made this movie not a 1 was the novelty of the 3-D. in 2-D, this movie would have been a horrible passed over movie no one would ever watch. but because of its gimmick, it got my 13.50. And i want at least half of it back. I don't like my horror movies to be super ultra gory. it doesn't make them good. it just makes them gross. There's an art to doing gore correctly and this movie didn't do it correctly. This movie's not a valentine, it's not even an arbor day present. I could go on dissertating how awful this movie is, but sadly, there's a word limit, So my bloody valentine 3-D will have to suffice with 2 bloody hearts in candy boxes, out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me get this out of the way - the 3D was fantastic. It does get a little tedious towards the end of the film however. Now that that's out of the way the movie itself is horrible. The killer is very easy to figure out in the very beginning and while the film attempts to hide this the first clue we're given is so obvious the red herrings are pointless. The story is about a miner who kills five other miners in a cave in with a pick ax. He winds up in a coma and then comes out of it in the hospital and literally kills everyone in the hospital. He rips out hearts and separates lower bodies from upper bodies, all while being a normal man... who just came out of a coma. Then he goes back to the site of the cave in which is now a party spot for teenager, seriously stupid teenagers but teenagers none the less. A bunch get killed, and four survive including one who is getting ready to get killed but the killer is shot and the blood is sprayed all over his face. Cut to ten years later and the dude who had the blood on his face is hearing voices and popping pills and the killer is back. Wonder who it is? Take a guess, you'll be right. The acting is terrible. Jamie King and Jessica Alba should start a "We can't act" club. The script is pretty bad as well. I like when the old cops are in the hospital in the beginning and the really old one looks at the young old one and says "Happy F***ing Valentine's Day!" Horrible. All in all not a scary movie. All the deaths were very fake looking and other than the 3D there wasn't an ounce of joy to be had by anyone in the theater. One guy actually started stomping on his glasses as the movie was ending. The two characters are telling each other they love each other and all I can hear is plastic flying through the air.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Axe &amp; You Shall Receive!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dracula 2000" director Patrick Lussier has taken a few liberties with the low-budgeted 1981 Canadian slasher saga "My Bloody Valentine." Nevertheless, he has retained most of the clichés and conventions of that largely predictable bloodbath and presented them with new vigor in his visually stunning 3-D remake. Eyeballs pop out at you in this state-of-the-art 3-D account, and the villain's predatory pickaxe plunges through the screen repeatedly to keep you perched on the edge of your seat. Bodies spout blood frequently and various severed body parts fly in your face. A tree branch smashes through the windshield of a vehicle as it careens into it, and it rams through the interior, shattering the rear window, and sticking out straight in your face as the vehicle halts. Clearly, "My Bloody Valentine" will gratify gorehounds, while the squeamish will huddle in abject horror. Mind you, Lussier's movie is the first R-rated, 3-D slasher in the latest 3-D craze that has hit theatres since 2008. No comparison exists between "My Bloody Valentine in 3-D" and 1982's "Friday the 13th Part III" in 3-D. This hair-raising hokum looks great even when the axe isn't altering somebody's anatomy. "Supernatural" star Jensen Ackles and "Dawson's Creek" star Kerr Smith vie for Jamie King while veteran character actors like Tom Atkins from "Creepshow" and Kevin Tighe of TV's "Emergency" flesh out the fringes.The new "My Bloody Valentine" qualifies as a three-star chiller with riveting four-star 3-D special effects. Lussier and scenarists Todd Farmer &amp; Zane Smith have integrated the "Fight Club" sight gag skillfully enough to keep you guessing about the psycho's identity. Costume plays an integral part in this mayhem. The maniac dons a miner's outfit, with its anonymous gas mask, goggles, coveralls, gauntlets, boots, and wields a pickaxe with devastating dexterity. You cannot tell who he is and the sound of his breathing strikes terror in the hearts of his victims. Watching this ominous exercise in calculating carnage in its flat, 2-D format is a complete waste of time and money. The only way to watch "My Bloody Valentine" is in 3-D! Lussier spares nothing in his ramped-up remake that features an entire sequence of gratuitous but hilarious nudity as a woman tries to dodge a pickaxe behind the box springs of a bed. A scene in a hospital features more chopped-up corpses than you want to count. You get to feast your eyes on two eviscerated corpses with their torsos cracked open like a slaughtered steers so you can ogle their spines. The original "My Bloody Valentine" combined elements of John Carpenter's "Halloween" and Sean Cunningham's "Friday the 13th, but that original independent Canadian horror chiller didn't coin enough bucks for Paramount Picture to launch a franchise. Lussier's lurid rehash, however, lets the psycho survive with a "Silence of the Lambs" gag, so a sequel is inevitable. Metaphorically, evil never dies! The action unfolds in the small mining town of Harmony, Pennsylvania. Lussier relies on a melodramatic montage of banner newspaper headlines to clue us in on the disaster at the Hanniger mine. Young Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles), the local mine owner's son, made a terrible mistake ten years ago that left five men dead and one in a coma. Sole survivor Harry Warden (Rick Walters) awakens from a year-long coma on Valentine's Day and embarks on a bloody rampage at the local hospital. Harry suits up in miner's garb and hacks his way through 22 people, before Sheriff Burke (Tom Atkins) and his deputy fill him with lead. Before Harry dies, the fiend drenches young Hanniger's face with gore galore. Traumatized by the experience, Hanniger hightails it out of Harmony, abandoning his sexy sweetheart Sarah (Jamie King of "The Spirit"), and heads off to parts unknown. Meanwhile, Hanniger's best friend, Axel Palmer (Kerr Smith), becomes Harmony's sheriff and marries Sarah. The death of his father prompts Hanniger to return to Harmony ten years later to sell the mine. Since the mine represents the life blood of the town, nobody is happy to see him. Predictably, horrible things begin to happen. Naturally, Axel suspects Hanniger is the guilty party, but most of the citizens insist that Harry Warden has risen from the grave.Lussier, who not only helmed "My Bloody Valentine" but also co-edited it, is a protégé of horror master Wes Craven, best known for his "Scream" trilogy. Clearly, Lussier has his head and heart in the right place for this slice of savagery. Lussier doesn't squander a moment in his concise 101 minute massacre and the climactic showdown in the mine between Axel and Tom with Sarah debating who to shoot generates some suspenseful humor. Unfortunately, despite all his sleight of hand, anybody with a brain will know the identity of the villain. The big difference between this "Bloody Valentine" and its predecessor is that the villain doesn't just stalk lusty teenagers. Anybody of any age?including a poor midget--is fair game. The big difference between the remake and the original is that in the original, the killer threatened to return to Harmony if the town celebrated Valentine's Day with a dance. The new "Bloody Valentine" doesn't have a dance. Lussier's ending surpasses the original and the film has a couple of exciting scenes, particularly when our heroine and another girl find themselves trapped in a grocery store.You couldn't axe for a better 3-D slasher than "My Bloody Valentine."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great 3D adds a lot to the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie first in 2D and then 3D. I'd give the 2D version a 7 and the 3D a 9, simply because the 3D effect is so successfully executed.The movie begins with an intro told through newspaper headlines on screen and news snippet voice overs about a killer in a mine who ended up in a coma. Then we are taken to the hospital where the killer awakens and causes havoc on Valentine's day. We see the very gory aftermath. Police follows the trail to the mine where our killer used to work. They shoot at him but it looks like he escapes.Now we are taken 10 years ago when a bunch of kids go partying in the mine when suddenly the killer appears wearing a miner's outfit, oxygen mask, the light-on-the-helmet always on and a pickax. He starts killing the kids. Our 4 main characters are two couples. 3 of them make it out and it seems that the 4th has to deal with the killer.Finally we get to the present day, 10 years after the party-turned-slaughter in the mine. One of the kids is the town sheriff now. He married the girl who used to be the girlfriend of the other guy. She runs a store with a lovely employee named Megan, who is involved with the sheriff and just informed him that she's pregnant. The guy who ended up in the mine 10 years ago comes back to the town. His dad used to own the mine and now as the majority shareholder he decided to sell it. While he's in a motel, we encounter the other girl again, who was part of the group 10 years ago. She's having sex with a truck driver, in the room next door. Eventually the killer appears and kills those two.The business of selling the mine doesn't go too well with the town's folk who depend on the mine so the owner is disliked by all. He also visits his ex, the sheriff's wife. Eventually bodies start piling up as the killer goes after the two girls, another miner, the old sheriff, etc. The cops are mystified since the old sheriff told them that he killed and buried the crazy miner 10 years ago. Yet these killings are identical and the killer looks the same.Our sheriff is suspicious of his former friend, the mine owner, as the killings coincide with his reappearance in town. His wife is more trusting. But the resolution of the mystery will lie with her and who she trusts more, her old flame or her cheating husband.As a horror movie this one delivers just what you expect: Gore, violence, and nudity. But I have to say that they ended up overdoing the pickax blows to the head as his killing m.o. Surely one can do more with a pickax and focus on different parts of the body. The story in general is good. I'm not convinced it was necessary to turn it into a whodunit. They could have just let the old re-awakened killer be it and do a straightforward horror movie. Instead we get intros after intros of what happened long time ago and then it becomes some psychopathological thriller. The second 3rd of the movie is rather dull and even boring as it's more about the relationship between the people. This doesn't have to be a bad thing except that in this movie, there is not one main character, and none are particularly likable. Also, a scene that should have been thrilling- the killer going after Megan and the wife in a convenience store- is exceedingly long and lacking in action.The 3D version is the one you want to see. In the 2D one, the problems with the story become more apparent. But all the good stuff is still there. In 3D however it looks great. This is not the old 3D with the red/green glasses. So the colors look normal. What is particularly outstanding is the effect when things are thrown at the camera. Unfortunately this happens only twice: the killer throws the pickax, and a girl throws a cell phone. Both really give the sensation that stuff is coming at you. They should have used this effect at least once more. Another great instance is when the police is looking at corpses, the sense of depth while seeing an open heart-less chest is excellent. I was surprised to see that the effect of light shining at the audience also works pretty well. But fire doesn't.An excellent horror movie in 3D that has all the elements of a classic. Unlike most horror movies whose shortcoming is a lack of story, here instead the problem is that they tried to do too much story-wise. A leaner story would have made things better, 10 or 15 minutes could have been cut to improve things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terror reigns supreme... in three glorious dimensions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Valentine's day. The day where we all share our love for each other by spending time with each other and spread the love. We give each other chocolates, and... well, I'm afraid that isn't the case on this valentines' Day.In fact, this one is all about terror. Terror, that is, in 3D! This is a remake of a Canadian horror film, and taken to American audience. And on top of that, this film is the first live action horror movie to be released in Digital 3D-yes, the Real D technology. This was my second time in the digital theater, the first being the second time seeing U2 3D (the first time I saw U2 3D was in IMAX). And Real D is a revolutionary technology and change to the 3D world. The lenses are polarized, instead of the godawful Red and Blue blur. This has to be the best 3D I've seen! Anyways, besides that, this movie is incredibly scary, and even scarier in 3D! On valentine's night, 1998, At a mine, there was a fatal accident, resulting in everyone down there dying except one- Harry Warden. He is knocked into a Coma, and awakens, taking a rampage on the city. He creates a brutal massacre and is later shot, thought to be dead.10 years later, Tom, a survivor of the massacre, owns the mine and is selling it. Axel, another survivor, is married with a kid, but is cheating on his wife and has gotten the adulteress pregnant. However, Harry isn't dead, he has clearly come back to finish what he has done 10 years ago! However, the horrific killings are all related to Tom somehow. They all have Tom's name on him, and Tom goes to discover why he is attached to it.Anyways, this is a fantastic 3D ride, and is even better than the craptacular original. It is everything the original should have been, and has LOADS of gore!!!!! There's gore everywhere. I love it. Me being a gore hound, I was satisfied with all the bloody stabbings, disembowelment and lovely stuff. It's what us horror fans expect. Plus the eye popping out of the screen was insane. The 3D was the most insane thing I've seen. I was dodging several times, and I jumped lots of times too. Great horror ride!!! So overall, this is a fantastic movie, one that's a must see for sure in the theater, and the ultimate 3D ride. As the trailer says, "Nothing says 'Date movie' like a 3D ride to hell"! OK I did not see it with a date, but overall, it was one of the most fun times I had at the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely a worthy remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember reading the plethora of gripes and groans when it was announced not too long ago that a remake of "My Bloody Valentine" was coming to theaters. "Can't they just leave classics alone!" and "I bet it will suck as much as the "Prom Night" remake" were spouted over and over again across the web. Well...surprise! This joins a very short list of recent horror remakes that is actually a WORTHY companion to its predecessor! Much like most remakes, "My Bloody Valentine 3D" is not a straight remake as much as it is a "reimagining." We get the same basic premise--a killer in a miner's outfit killing off people during the Valentine holiday--and even get the same character's, but a lot is switched up here. Still, it the changes do not ruin the concept original like the changes in the recent "Prom Night" and "Black Christmas" remakes did. The premise of the original film actually makes up the first 15 minutes of this film. After that, we are introduced to a new story, involving Tom (Jensen Ackles) returning home to Harmony where, 10 years earlier, a miner named Harry Warden went on a murderous rampage after being the soul-survivor of a mine collapse that many blame Tom for. His teenage sweetheart, Sara (Jaime King) is now married to Axel (who is now the town sheriff (Kerr Smith). The three share something in common, as they all were survivors of Harry Warden's murderous rampage years before. Almost as soon as Tom arrives in town, a killer in a mining uniform begins butchering people who survived or are somehow involved with the massacre 10 years earlier. Who is the killer? Did Harry Warden return for revenge? Well, it is probable not THAT hard to figure the killer's identity out, but is sure is a hell of a fun ride along the way! First, this film looks gorgeous. I know that is not something that is often said about a slasher film, but it is very fitting here. The 3D is so effective and the colors and camera shots are crisp and life-like. The setting is perfect and very reminiscent of the town from the original. The acting is decent from all involved and the script and dialogue is surprising NOT hokey. Tension is created very well, particularly during the grocery store chase scene and the atmosphere created in the mine is very effective and claustrophobic. But the real star here are the the gore effects, brought to us in glorious 3D! The film is surprisingly gory--much more gory than the original--and the 3D makes it all that more great! I am SO glad Lussier decided to make this true to its 80's slasher roots because folks, this is a 100% R-rated slasher film through and through and makes no apologies for being so. Yes, there are some blatant clichés and the ending is very predictable, but slasher films are suppose to be brainless fun and that is what this film is: fun.I can only hope the upcoming "Friday the 13th" remake is this good, though certainly do not have my hopes up. Seriously, if these classic slasher films are going to be remade THIS is the way to do it. Nelson McCormick, Glenn Morgan, and even Rob Zombie could learn a few things from watching this. My bet is this will end up being one of, if not THE, best horror film to make it into theaters this year.FrightMeter Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine delivers exactly what you should be looking for if you see this movie: plenty of gore in the tradition of 70s/80s slasher pics. If you're a fan of the genre (or at least inventive pick killings), you won't be disappointed. If you're not, why are you reading this?The 3D is a nice addition, but this movie stands on its own without it. It doesn't rely on cheesy 3D gimmicks to keep you interested. They use all the old slasher plot devices and characters to tell the story. It's a lot of fun to see in the theater, so don't wait for the DVD. If you're a fan, get out there and support this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is another slasher film but it is a step above your typical teenage slasher film. Basically a guy comes back after disappearing for 10 years and murders start happening again. In the end he is the killer. Not much to it. The film leads you on on to thinking of if the sheriff or Tom is the killer. To much of my disappointment, it was Tom. Pretty generic ending. The movie wasn't bad, it had some decent acting. What help the plot was that it didn't involve a situation with a bunch of high schoolers going out for some fun but end up getting killed but more townfolks that are connected in some way, putting it a step above your typical teenage slasher like unlike movies like Friday the 13th, or Texas Chainsaw Massacre for instance. What ruined it was it was pretty generic everywhere else. Killer ends up somehow in a certain situation, kills someone in a violent manner, the somehow, magically, gets away. All while the victims never get help, like why didn't Sarah or Megan call for help on their cell phones when being attack- unless they had them in their purse, and why didn't deputy Ferris call for backup when entering the house or why didn't the sheriff call for backup when going after his wife, little things like that bother me in these types of movies. Overall, really, the movie was pretty generic, would have liked it better if they would have had a better ending. I was hoping the the deputy was the killer and the sheriff and Tom were not, that would have been a great ending that no one would have saw. So, I give it a 6 out of 10, passing, will watch again if on TV, maybe on DVD if I have time, but nothing really great. Somday now I have to watch the original to compare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whoa! Just finished watching and am still enticed by the camera work done by the folks out there! The movie certainly was able to keep me glued to my seat. The plot, the locations and almost everything about the movie suffices the need for what's to be called as a quote - unquote horror flick. Though the shredded bodies sometime makes one sick enough to turn the face around, but the gore is very well presented to every minute detail. And for those of you who might be wondering about the "3D" in the promotional title, well be rest assured, you would feel it for yourself! Quite nice effects of objects seem to be flying out of screen towards you makes you feel kinda different from regular and mundane horror flicks. See it yourself to have a peek at the new genre defined by this title. My overall rating 8/10. Definitely not for faint-hearted!</fullReview>

My date and i were laughing throughout the whole entire thing. The characters are simply idiots, they make the dumbest decisions I've ever seen in a movie. The acting is i think maybe one of the only kind of good things about this movie. The deaths are unoriginal, everyone dies almost the same way. Through most of the movie i heard more laughter throughout the theater than screams, people didn't take it seriously. And the big reason as to why everyone went to see this movie was, it was 3D. The 3D aspect couldn't even save it. There are a few moments where the 3D affects do scare you, but other than that it just hurts your eyes. Don't see. 2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3-D is okay, film not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of the 1981 slasher, having to do with a maniac in a coal miner's costume killing everyone.I liked the original better, but this one is more fun simply because of the 3-D entertainment value.Having axes and fire come off the screen at the audience is what made it worthwhile for the ticket price, although you could have just as much fun going to an amusement park. It would be great if they could somehow make a 3D function on the DVD release somehow.There's plenty of gore for hard-core fans, some female nudity, killings and all that. Everything what you'd typically expect for this kind of horror.What the movie really lacks is some sort of originality. Actors are okay, good enough for this type of movie. Jaime King is particularly riveting.Other than that, if you're not expecting anything amazing story-wise, and just want some distraction it's an OK fun way to spend 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to see this movie when it first came out but I saw the Unborn and people were talking and yelling throughout the entire movie so i waited and i went last night with my girlfriend at like 7:45 and it was perfect, we were the only people in there under 21 so we could actually enjoy the movie. If I was to see this in 2-D, I think it would have sucked and not have been that enjoyable but this is that kind of movie were you have to see it in 3-D because it's a Blast. This is the future of 3-D, Real-D, and I must say that the movie alone was good but that 3-D effect added so much more suspense and action to it. I really enjoyed the movie and was worth the 9 bucks to go see it. It's of course, a psychological thriller and also a bloodbath but it's so much fun. Definitely go see this movie in 3-D, it's worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BEFORE I SPOIL THE FILM FOR YOU I HAVE TO SAY WOW WOW AND MORE WOW. WENT TO SEE THIS EXPECTING AN AVERAGE RUN OF THE MILL SLASHER MOVIE BUT WOW BLEW ME AWAY..... WELL DONE THE PRODUCERS AND DIRECTORTen years ago a cave-in on the north side of a mine owned and operated by Hanniger Mining Co. trapped six miners. When rescue teams arrived, they found five dead&#x2014;killed by a pick axe&#x2014;and one, Harry Warden (Richard John Walters), in a coma. The local papers accused Warden of killing the other five to prolong his air supply; the boss' son, Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles) is questioned but released. He is blamed for the mine disaster because he forgot to vent the methane lines.A year later, on Valentine's Day, Warden awakes from his coma and escapes the hospital, killing several of the staff in the process. At the abandoned mineshaft that was the site of the disaster, a party is in full swing, attended by many teens, including Axel (Kerr Smith), his girlfriend Irene (Betsy Rue), Tom Hanniger, and his girlfriend, Sarah (Jaime King). Tom doesn't want to go into the mine, and says he's going back for the beer out of the car. Sarah goes in alone. Sarah gets lost looking for Axel and Irene until she is confronted by Harry Warden in full miner's garb, carrying a pick-axe, and flees for safety; Axel grabs her and they hide from the killer. He eventually sees them, and they run out of the mine, where they run into Tom. The killer hits him with the pick axe, injuring him, while the other three run for the car and leave him behind. Tom runs back into the mine in an attempt to get away from the killer; the police arrive and shoot the killer as he makes his getaway back into the mine.Ten years later, Tom returns to town to sell the mine. Axel is now sheriff and married to Sarah. Irene is murdered at the motel where Tom is staying, then a miner is murdered in the mineshaft where Warden was chased by the cops. Axel asks his father, the retired sheriff, what happened to Warden. He says that he and Tom's father killed and buried him. Axel, Tom, Sarah and Axel's father go to the spot where Warden was buried to see that his body is no longer there.Next, the current mine manager and Axel's mistress are killed. Tom picks Sarah up to take her to Axel's love nest to convince her that Axel is the killer. Axel then calls her and tells her that Tom is the killer. She crashes Tom's car and makes her way to Axel's shack. Sarah is chased by the killer all the way to the mine. There, Sarah goes into the shaft where the original murders took place, where she is joined by both Tom and Axel, and after a brief stand off, Axel and Sarah realize that Tom is delusional and sees himself as Warden. Sarah shoots a methane tank, causing a fireball to knock down Tom. She escapes with Axel. A rescue team comes in to the mine and Tom kills one of the rescuers and escapes dressed as one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lets start with the good things about this film. It was 3d and I think it made the film rather enjoyable to watch. When I first saw the trailer for this film, I was skeptical that the movie would suck and they would have the grand excuse "Well its 3d" as if that would make it awesome. With that said the acting was really good, the storyline was decent, towards the end you were sorta on the edge of your seat. This movie also did a decent job of creating an atmosphere.I do have a few issues with this move. I think they could have done much more with the 3d aspect. If you are thinking the pop out at you scenes are going to be right in your face then you are wrong. There is about 1 part when they do that. It actually made me angry because I said to myself "wow they really are capable of doing that,yet they chose not to"... While the dialog is pretty good, I found myself bored in the middle. There just wasn't as much mystery as they wanted to portray. Most of the victims that were murdered weren't developed well as characters, so I didn't really care. For example 1 victim was sleeping with a man who was married...With everything said this movie is a good experience. I say bring a date, get some popcorn, enjoy the nerdy glasses and have fun. Do not expect a "movie of the year", just a good time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A miner goes on a rampage in a small town ultimately becoming an urban legend.Ten years later hes back(or is he?)to finish what he started.MBV 81 was like a live action Scooby Doo movie for me when I was a kid &amp; I loved it.Twenty + years later &amp; I still have fun watching it.However as hard as I tried MBV 09 failed to entertain me. Why? Maybe because I've seen it all before or maybe the makers of this new one beat you over the head too much with all the gimmicks &amp; forget crucial nuances that are needed to make any B horror movie watchable. In the original there was a town full of people that I actually believed in &amp; a whole cast of people that constituted the miners,family &amp; friends aka body count. MBV 09 widdles it down to just a love triangle making it easy to pinpoint the one of two people who are offing everyone. The makers of MBV 09 have no clue what made the miner scary in the original. It has to be the mask &amp; the pick ax right?! Wrong.He was flesh &amp; blood &amp; loved by a lot of people. Hence once the charade was up &amp; he was unmasked it was heartbreaking. Get it?! The original was all about heart...literally. The best horror movies are those that take a simple premise &amp; elevate it to another level by sustaining the suspense &amp; gore for the right moments.A slasher movie is good when in the end you feel bad for the mass murdering psycho. I felt nothing for anyone in MBV 09. Which is a shame because gimmicks aside I think with just a little more thought MBV 09 could have been enjoyable. I was equally unimpressed with the 3d. The new real Real-D medium like the dawn of the CGI revolution will have more downs than ups but unlike CGI Real-D is limited to only 3 types of movies. Therefor it can never be used artistically to enhance a smaller movie where needed. In the meantime we are going to see a lot of crap that you would never watch or go see passed through using Real-D as a gimmick to get people into theaters. Oh well I will just stick with the kiddie flicks when it comes to Real-D. Coraline &amp; Ice Age look fantastic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very cool movie! I've never attended a 3D movie before and I wasn't prepared for what was in store.Harry Warden (Richard John Walters) goes on a Valentine's Day killing spree when he wakes up from his coma. He is supposedly killed by officers and buried in the woods. After ten years, Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles) returns to his hometown to sell the mines his father left to him. His ex-girlfriend, Sarah (Jaime King) now married to his greatest enemy, Axle (Kerr Smith) wonders why he's returned after disappearing for ten years. Axle is having an affair with Sarah's co-worker, Megan (Megan Boone) who reveals she is pregnant. At the same time Tom returns, killings begin to start happening by a man who wears a mining suit (much like Harry Warden's MO) around Valentine's Day.The 3D effects are just simply wicked. I can't even begin to describe how awesome it is to see things 'come out of the screen.' The story is really cool and invents a new serial killer. I like the killer because he is not superhuman like Michael Myers. I also liked the twist, regardless of the fact that I figured it out 20 minutes before it was finally revealed. The violence and gore was really cool and the sound effects make you cringe. But I absolutely adored the bloody death scenes.I think the 18A rating is because of the full-frontal nudity on screen for over 3 minutes. Other than that, it would be a 14A movie. There is surprisingly a ton of comedic relief and the audience laughed at some good one-liners. For the most part, this film does it's job and horrifies you. It probably won't scare you because they don't use cheap scare tactics, but that's definitely a good thing.After seeing this, my faith of 2009's horror films is restored. I thought maybe since The Unborn was dreadful, that all movies in the horror genre were doomed. I was very wrong. This is an awesome movie, and one you'll want to see twice in one day! Go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With 2009 upon us, one had to wonder how quickly another remake would come. And we got the answer: a little over two weeks. And of course, although it is not the only remake in this, the first quarter of 2009, "My Bloody Valentine" could very well be the most memorable one.Shot in Digital 3D, this remake offers some pretty graphic scenes of mutilation and suspense that are fun to watch. Indeed, watching this film, I quickly came to the conclusion that, but for not editing enough to attain a PG13/AA14 rating, this could've been quite an early year success at the box office.The original 1981 Canadian film of the same name was a typical 80's slasher about a madman who had turned to dismembering mostly young people to discourage a small town from celebrating Valentine's Day, which had become a time of gruesome recollection due to a massacre years earlier. Well, many of the same features make it into the remake: the mine is the central focus, a small town gripped by the ghost of Harry Warden, a miner who years earlier had perpetrated a massacre.However the peculiar thing from a story standpoint is that they really managed to screw up the central formula. In the original, a moratorium on Valentine's celebrations had prevented massacres from taking place; in this remake, the massacre just seems to start up after ten long years, for what seems to be no reason in particular.In one very peculiar scene at the beginning of the movie, pretty much everyone in the mine is dead, and yet it apparently doesn't stop a seemingly sober party goer from fooling around, and then getting his head impaled on a pick axe! Rather than ruin it, I will say that there is a surprise in store for those who remember the 1981 movie, and to my astonishment, it works rather well. It is for this reason, along with the fact that both Kerr Smith and Jensen Ackles are just so bloody cute, that I would be willing to budge on a 1/10 (what I gave the "Black Xmas" remake), and give it a 3/10 on a 2D screen.However in Digital 3D, I think the filmmakers really made an excellent choice, and as ridiculous as the story is for the most part, the movie is quite an experience to watch because there is very little out there like this. It is for that reason that I give "My Blood Valentine 3D" a 6/10.See it in the theaters in Digital 3D...or wait for the DVD to come out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why? Why? Whyyyyyyy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every year Hollywood comes out with one of these fast food horror remakes. First, cram the movie with a bunch of young untalented actors/actresses who more than likely got famous off of a melodrama TV show like One Tree Hill. Second, get a second rate director who will sit there and says action, cut, action, cut because there really isn't need for a second take, and who needs interesting camera work just frame every scene exactly the same. Third, watch the money roll in.If you've every seen any slasher movie ever you've seen My Bloody Valentine. Just picture the killer in a coal miner's outfit and a few references to Valentine's Day, and there you have it. The plot as usual consists of killer is introduced, he kills people, is revealed to be someone significant, dies, roll credits.There is no reason to watch this movie unless you really like watching people get killed with a pick-ax. You don't care about a single character and even though someone if dying every other minute it's amazingly still boring. The last half hour or so I was just praying for it to be over.The only thing keeping it from being a 1 is the fact that it has a decent "maybe it's him, maybe it's him" section at the climax. I also didn't see it in 3-D so maybe that would've helped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How the original should have been done!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MY BLOODY VALENTINE is a remake of the 1981 movie of the same name.I have seen dozens upon dozens of slasher movies from the 1980s, which started with the truly terrific, Friday THE 13TH in 1980. I am a fan of such movies and am proud to be so. The original MY BLOODY VALENTINE was one of the countless examples produced to cash-in on the unexpected box-office success of Friday THE 13TH. Some fans of the original movie believe it is one of the best examples of the "cash-ins" but I feel that it was in reality a sub-par effort and not nearly as good as, say, THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW, SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE or SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT.The 2000s has been a truly terrible decade for horror movie productions, with various ghastly remakes forming a large portion of the output. The only decent examples of great horror movies from this period include SAW and WRONG TURN.The 2009 version of MY BLOODY VALENTINE is hardly Oscar-worthy material and probably won't win any awards but it does represent a rare example of a remake that surpasses the original.The set-up remains almost identical to the original - a miner named Harry Warden goes crazy and on Valentine's day murders several people with a pick-axe. The set-up scenes in this version are far superior to the original. They last much longer and generate much more suspense rather than the single shock killing in the original.The movie continues as it means to go on and the killer continues as mean as he intends to go on.The original movie descended into long periods of tedious scenes featuring various boring forgettable characters after the solid opening scenes. Only a few graphic killing scenes breathed life into it. In contrast, the remake is much better paced. There are plenty of graphic killings, gratuitous sex and nudity, incredibly funny moments and action-packed cat-and-mouse chases. It is also packed with clichés and throwbacks to the 1980s movies that prove to be a nice homage. If the original movie had contained these things, it would have been a genuine classic.I can demonstrate how this remake avoids the pitfalls of remakes of other movies made in the 2000s. There are no speeded-up action scenes killing intensity. There are no characters who conveniently forget about their fallen comrades two minutes after they are killed. There are no bright landscapes that make suspense impossible to build. There are very few "jump" scare clichés. And it pleases me to confirm that there are no, repeat no annoying moronic teenagers one usually finds in this type of movie. As such, the producers made decisions that allowed for the opportunity of a successful remake during a decade when most horror movies have been truly awful.Opinion is heavily divided over the quality of the acting and dialogue. Some claim the poor acting and idiotic dialogue are deliberate intentions on the part of the producers as part of a tongue-in-cheek approach. Others claim these factors degrade the quality of the movie to the level of straight-to-DVD movies. Regardless of which group is correct, I thought these factors added to the entertainment and provided a nod to the "so bad it's good" sub-genre I love so much.The identity of the killer is limited to a small number of characters but the script is carefully crafted to keep the viewer guessing until the final conclusion.Another good point of this movie is the score. Unlike most movies of this kind where a completely unrelated random pop or rap song is tagged on to the end credits, this one actually uses proper music that suits the tone of the movie. The ending credits also don't continue for about 10 minutes unlike most modern movies.The only real downside to the movie is the direction, which focuses far too heavily on showcasing the 3D effects, and not enough on the suspense and atmosphere. However, the effects are good enough to make the killings and attacks have a substantial impact. As such, the movie works as an updated version of the 1980s slashers in this respect.A second downside is the continuous overuse of strong language, which seems to make the script look amateurish and moronic rather than providing moments of humour and realism as was clearly the intention.My only other minor complaint is the waste of Tom Atkins - I believe this veteran of 1980s movies should have had a more prominent role. But in any scenario, it was a wise decision to include him in the cast.Overall, MY BLOODY VALENTINE is not a masterpiece by any means but is a remake that far surpasses the blandness of the original movie and worth seeing for fans of 1980s slasher movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was a remake of the 1981 classic slasher flick.I went to this film on February the 13th this year. Each ticket bought for the film ensures you get 3D glasses with it to view this film in 3D.I have seen the original and this remake makes 3D movies that more special.I was too young to see Jaws 3D or Friday the 13th Part 3 in 3D or Anityville 3D.The film had good special effects and a simple plot to follow. The experience of 3D in a cinema gave the film the impression that the pick axe was coming right at your face. I even tried to grab the dog in one scene at the motel and tried to dodge a bullet being fired from a gun.The basic plot is that there was a mining accident with one survivor. A few months later, night there is a party with teens in one of the old mines, and then most of them get hacked up. Ten years later, people are winding up dead, all connected with the party in the mine.Horror film buffs, especially slasher fans, old and new will appreciate this film and its take on making you feel you are part of the terror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Bloody Valentine 3-D: My waste of time, the other day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine 3-D is simply cash out of pocket and no chocolates! The only reason for this complete waste of time and money was on the premise, of an adult, 3-D thriller. This film is a remake of the My Bloody Valentine. (1981) The actions of a gas mask wearing, coverall clothed, coal miner, gone crazy. Director Patrick Lussieer, obviously was not sure, if he wanted to make a comedy or a horror film, to pay homage to this horror classic. So, instead, he put both genera's together and came up with neither. Yes, there are a few very funny scenes, but these few, do not make a film. This attempt at a horror movie, is R rated because of nudity, graphic violence, and adult sexuality. As a slasher-splatter film it is too forced, even in 3-D. The use of 3-D CGI, in this film does not go far enough. Wearing the Grey-tinted 3-D glasses are much better for the viewer, but not so in this attempt. The reason is simple: items that do come at you, right out of the screen, do not complete their journey. Weather it be a pick Ax, flames of fire, or bullets, all of these missiles, stop short of their marks. Similarly, the actors fall just as flat. Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles) the male lead, should have stayed on the small screen, as the lead in Supernatural. Sarah Palmer (Jamie King) his love interest, should force her agent to see this film, as punishment for a waste of her acting talent. The rest of the cast, except for the pickax toting coal miner should go back to position one, and stay there! The monster of this film, the coal miner, is the only character, who stays in character, and does so, true to form. As the ending credits were rolling, so was the audience; right out of the theater. But to those of you who really want their best dollar value, stay to the bitter end. My Bloody Valentine 3-D is a very, empty, box of chocolates.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Totally awesome horror movie! In a 100% formulaic gory horror movie way. I love crappy horror movies, and this was very enjoyable because it provided high production values along with boobs and gore. This is your typical slasher flick, done perfectly to form. The killer behaves EXACTLY like Jason or Michael Mayers in that he basically can't be killed, even if shot many times - yet stupidly moves slow when hunting down even stupider people, every single way a major film franchise slasher acts, the killer in this films also acts. There is a lot of blood, and a lot of excellent gore - in some movies, the camera pans away from some really gory happening, sometimes in this movie, the camera doesn't pan away and lets you see the gore. Of course the acting and plot was bad, I don't even remember any of the characters, I'm just glad they were killed off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not know where to begin, but I do know I will not dwell on details as this movie does not even deserve a fraction of my time neither yours lol. There are hundreds of inconsistencies throughout the film with dialog, factual goofs, and ridiculous stunts. Now, I will give it this: it is a lot of fun to watch in 3-D. It really psyches you out when you see a gun pointing in your face or a pick axe swinging toward you. That was pretty crazy. However, the acting absolutely ruined the entire movie. Not to mention, you have to sit through an entire 10 minutes (I didn't even count) of a girl running around, completely naked, in a hotel parking lot. She really didn't have anything to look at as far as breasts are concerned (speaking from a girl's point of view) so I didn't blush as much as I would have thought. It is just the view of her vagina that kind of bothered me while my blind date was sitting next to me yelling, "Damn!" and then grabbing my hand to hold onto and rubbing it seductively. Yeah, that was kind of awkward haha lol. My suggestion is this: If you are looking for a fun, gruesome, poor quality horror movie, then this is definitely for you. If you are looking to watch a scary, thrilling, productive horror/suspense with a plot, then do not even bother.</fullReview>

The lulls created by plot expansion made this film feel more like islands of gore instead a forest of dread, fear and horror.I didn't enjoy the film at all.

I tried to take off the glasses and watch the film without them but the 3D effect made the film blurry to watch. The 3D aspect did not make the film frightening it just made the "special effects" look cheap. There was not a lot of gore here, they just added enough violence and skin to get above a PG-13 rating. The 3D stuff/R rating was just a gimmick to make the film appear it was going to be more intense than what it actually was. Save your money folks and see it when it hits the video store.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm pretty fond of the original, especially in light of the reinstated gore sequences, but I thoroughly enjoyed this gore soaked blood bath.It spends relatively little time on meaningless chat and quickly gets down and dirty. You know exactly what you're getting' into within the first five minutes; some heavy duty gore on display early on. As far as 3-D movies go, I went into this one a virgin and quite liked it, some pretty impressive effects here and that does add some novelty to the disgusting ongoings here.The story ain't nothing' to write home about, it's fairly pedestrian and predictable, but it moves along at a crackling pace and there's not much breathing room between kills. After all, that's what we came for.In the end this remake doesn't crap on the memory of the original and is more than solid fun for fans of on-screen bloodshed. Bloody good fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful. Simply awful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, where to begin. I have to say this is in my bottom 5 worst movies I have ever seen. This is no different than any other cheap slasher film, other than this is in 3-D. The acting was poor at best. The dialog was awful. And the whole storyline of the film was pretty predictable and mindless. The only reason I somewhat enjoyed this film--other than the mediocre 3-D visuals--was I laughed at a good half of it. That is how bad it is.As I mentioned, the storyline of the film is pretty mindless. It starts off with 3-D newspaper clippings of miner Harry Warden butchering is co-workers in order to conserve air in the collapsed mine. He is found, in a coma, and is brought to a hospital. He wakes from this coma, and unbelievably butchers the entire hospital. Harry then returns to the mine where he worked, and kills a bunch of kids having a party there. Who on Earth parties in a mine anyway? Four get away, and two sheriffs shoot him a bunch of times, yet Harry still manages to run away into the now-collapsing mine. He is supposedly dead, but ten years later, the unbelievable murders start up again.Now, as mindless as this story is, the acting and dialog is far worse. I'm pretty sure I had better actors in my high school drama club. They were all one-dimensional, and no one had even a decent performance. There were more than a few scenes where I burst out laughing at the horrid acting and dialog. Sometimes I didn't know whether to take the characters seriously because of how poorly they delivered their lines. Also, there are plenty of the unnecessary cliché horror movie elements. The character tripping and falling, and the cheesy writing on the wall by the killer are just a couple.Overall, this movie deserves a solid 2 out of 10. I gave it a 2 because it did keep me entertained--at how horrible it really was. But honestly don't waste your 11 bucks on this mindless slasher film. Seeing a couple eyeballs in 3-D is not worth it.</fullReview>

Your expressions and reactions to the film may become realistic. If you hadn't flinch, dodge, swing, "touch", kick or what not, then I think you may be Tom...On the entertainment part, this was great work done to this movie. You just don't know what to expect at any given time. The fun part about having on the 3D glasses is that you're the witness. You're standing in front of everything that's going on. Either you're brave or you can be bold. Or else the horror... will leave you frightened...Well worth seeing. Watching such a 3D movie is like never seen before.

I took my fraternity brothers because I have been talking about this movie since i rushed last semester. they were all really skeptical. but once the movie started i kinda think they enjoyed it a little more than i did. but we were cheering, screaming, laughing, dodging gun barrels and bloody pick axes in our seats.this movie is a great roller-coaster thrill ride despite its minor pacing issues in the beginning of the film.great homages to the original and slasher films in general.i didn't see the end coming and was very content with its conclusion.yes some parts of the film would not be as entertaining in 2D but the film its self is a great slasher, good kills, lots of blood, chilling at moments, creepy, eerie, good plot. ild say its one of the best remakes because its so true to the genre and its rules. Betsy Rue has one of the more amusing and thrilling scenes and the grocery store scene has people yelling at the screen.plus we have a cast of smart self conflicted adults which made the character relationships better than in the original.plus...Jaime King has earned her place as a horror scream queen. im proud of her.it was a fun night and i will be seeing it a few more times this weekend and watching the hell out of it on DVD.overall the films an 8/10...not perfect but its a whole lot of something...dam good something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's the PADDLE BALL man when you need him??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, allow me to get this out of the way, I wanted to like this film. I did. I had prepared myself for gore and fun cheesy "comin' at ya" 3D effects and bad acting with unbelievable subplots and dialogue, but who could have anticipated the bland non existent story line or the 3D effects that went to the SIDE rather than straight at you? NOBODY and I mean not ONE person in the audience jumped at any of the 3D scare tricks. That should tell you something about this colossal bore of a movie. It's a career killer for an actor to be in a film like this. Yeah okay, Johnny Depp was in one in the beginning of his career, but can you name another actor who went on to have a career after doing a film like this? The naked girl under the bed in this movie? That's her film. Her career, finished. Same with the other actors in this lame brain rip off of a movie. MY BLOODY VALENTINE doesn't even attempt to establish character, let alone plot. The guy comes back to reclaim his old girlfriend and sell the mine. That's it. End of plot. After everything we've learned about these type of slasher films why can't some new ingredients be added to them? An homage to Friday the 13th? Why? Another horror film with faces that your mind flushes away as soon as you see them. Characters that no one cares about. So what if they're murdered horribly, we can't even remember what they look like because they were barely in the movie 4 minutes before getting bumped off. An excuse just to ax another character to death gets so boring after the umpteenth time and all within the first 20 minutes. And of COURSE, the SUPER human serial killer that never gets seen by witnesses in a rather large town where every street is empty when a crisis occurs. Characters that walk toward the serial killers sounds rather than use a telephone instead. Never mind just turning your back and running in the opposite direction. A mind numbingly bad score that floods the soundtrack and prepares you for the scares long before they happen, so when the jumps do happen it's no surprise to anyone. A serial killer that is a rip off of all the bad slasher movie sequels you've ever sat through, but less want to remember. We know what this is all for. To make a fast buck and hopefully trigger a chain of sequels. I doubt there will be a return to MY BLOODY VALENTINE. There's nothing original here to spawn a slew of sequels. The film introduces it's best 3D effect early on with an eye ball trick and then it's all "to the side" from there. The 3D effects go to the side, not right at you as they should and how they did in the classic and still the best 3D horror film ever made, HOUSE OF WAX with Vincent Price. That film had the intelligence to tease the audiences senses with 3D and demonstrating that 3D can give off chills and be fun at the same time. My Bloody Valentine does neither. A waste of money and a waste of an afternoon at the movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not expecting a lot from this movie and yet I was still disappointed. The directing is so god awful it's actually painful to watch and the reason for me saying this is that every single shot is a missed opportunity. It's like they intentionally looked at the scene and said wow it would be really scary if we filmed from these angles, with this lighting and these sound effects and background music....and the went in the complete opposite direction. This might all be on purpose because the movie studio thought it would make more money on a cheesy movie that even the biggest wuss would dare to see.Besides all this it lacks several of the other key elements:1. Bad character development - you don't care about the characters at all or relate to them.2. Lame killer - No reason for him killing the people (Yes a killer with no motives can be scary, but it's very hard to pull off and this movie doesn't come close...at all) And also no reason for the way a does it and no back story.3. Just generally a poor story that seems half baked and with lots plot holes and stupid ideas.So to sum up...NO ! this is not a good movie. I really love horror movies and I hope someone will come along and bring the genre back on track (Basically it's needs the Begins/Dark Knight treatment...In which I mean it has to be a serious project for all the parties involved)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A terrible accident happens in the mine in the small town of Harmony, and five people are killed. The one survivor falls into a deep coma. One year later, he wakes up again and goes on a mad killing spree. Finally he is taken down. A decade later, the murders begin again. Is he back? Has Harry Warden returned? Or is someone copying his M.O., of wearing a gas-mask and attacking with a pick-axe? This may be the best of these recent slashers, the reimaginings(I haven't watched the '81 version of this, so I can make no comparisons) of classic ones. No, it's not a masterpiece, still, it's a noticeable step in the right direction. The acting is pretty good. Ackles may as well be portraying Dean Winchester in this, that's how he goes through the whole thing, but hey, it's playing to his strength; he is intense. His eyes, his Bat-Bale voice, his body language. It's put to nice use here. Kerr is a jerk, like in Final Destination(isn't he always?). The same goes for Tighe. Typecasting! The characters are not as obnoxious as they tend to be in this kind of flick, there is some development of them(heck, they even have conflict, and they aren't merely yelling at each other), and we tend to know them at least a bit before they're killed, rather than them appearing on-screen mere moments before their demise. The deaths can be creative(not to mention relatively effective, you care a little, you're not happy to see them die), and the FX on the brutal and disturbing gore and blood is great. While I did not see this in 3D, it's quite clear that it was shot for that... it throws stuff directly at the camera every so often, and I could see that heightening the experience. It isn't distracting enough to ruin when you see it in 2D, and that brings me to how this can be genuinely creepy and atmospheric. For using several jump-scares, this manages to really get to you, really do a number on your nerves. The twist is clever and holds up reasonably, and this has far more subtlety(and nearly no flash! See, Michael Bay? This is how you do it!) than most of these new ones. We remain in fear of the figure stalking and slaughtering these people, in spite of us seeing him fully for a while. It might have to do with his seemingly superhuman brawn... or maybe this takes place in an alternate reality where everyone is constructed of Jell-O. The plot holds up OK, if certain things are not resolved(at least not satisfactorily, and not everything makes a difference). One misstep with this is the focus on the date... the massacres occur on Valentine's Day, and while that in itself is not a problem, this chooses to make a huge deal out of that, without it ever amounting to anything. In the earliest scenes, hearts are seen having been removed from the dead bodies, and they appear in conjunction with the greeting cards and boxes of chocolate. This would all work well if this had anything to do with love, or any real connection to the "holiday". It's not like 2001's Valentine, where that is very much the case. There is some direct sexuality and a lot of nudity(in fact, that's one of the places where this reaches a new low for this kind of thing... that's all I'm going to say) in this, in addition to what I've already mentioned. The DVD comes with a trailer for each of the following: The Road, Drag Me To Hell, Tournament and Bronson. I recommend this to fans of the subgenre. Not up to par with the original ones, however, it's getting there, gradually. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3-D but pretty flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second Horror movie (after Scar 3-D) that introduces itself and the newer/better 3-D technology to the audience. The Gimmick is put to a good use and some veteran actors are thrown into the mix, to help the younger actors through this pretty foreseeable movie. There not many surprises and the drama/story is pretty thin.But it's the 3-D that does deliver and heightens the movie a bit above average. The story as it is, is pretty bog standard and wouldn't really be engaging to any Horror aficionado. But even in it's simplicity it is far better than the aforementioned Scar (3-D) movie. A second viewing (which I went through) isn't really something most people will do/endure. At least not the whole movie, so it's nice to have the DVD/Blu Ray version and jump to your "favorite scene". While it's fun and enjoyable, it's nothing great ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fun remake with some great kills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is an enjoyable little slasher flick.there are some very inventive,sick kills.the acting is all right for this type of genre.there isn't a lot of suspense though,and the characters do a lot of stupid things that people in those situation in real life probably wouldn't.still,it's not a bad movie for a remake.i admit when the killer was finally unmasked,i was surprised at who it was.i thought i knew several times throughout the movie,but i was wrong.so in that sense,i didn't find it predictable,and unpredictability is something i really like in a movie.i think this remake is actually better than the original.but then again, the version i saw was cut thanks to censors and missing many scenes.now there is a special edition with those scenes restored.anyway,for me,this 2009 version of My Bloody Valentine is a 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harmony, Pennsylvania has barely had time to forget a tragic mining accident that happened ten years ago. The lone miner to survive, Harry Warden(Rich Walters), awakens from a coma on Valentine's Day and brutally murders over twenty people with a pickax. Another survivor, Tom Harringer(Jensen Ackles), comes back to Harmony after a stint in a mental institute to sell that mining company inherited from his father. The mining company still means a livelihood for most of the town; but there is still those horrible memories of the deadly mineshaft. Once again there is a slayer on the loose wearing a miner's mask and brandishing a pickax.There is plenty of graphic murders...pretty damn gory; and you know that is what we all like. My favorite scene is where a naked bimbo is chasing a trucker in a motel parking lot wanting the recently shot homemade sex tape. She is then chased by the crazed miner that is running amok. Not totally cheesy, but a well paced horror/thriller in which director Patrick Lussier keeps the actual killer's identity a secret for as long as he can. Being disappointed is not an option.Also in the cast: Jaime King, Kerr Smith, Kevin Tighe, Ted Farmer and Betsy Rue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The advertisement for this movie left me with a pretty clear idea of what it would be about. A slasher movie, but with a twist (and 3D - quite daring). The presence of not-all-that-unknown actors should take it up a notch.The movie started, and though the first minute made me hopeful, the second minute reminded me of those movies from the seventies and the eighties. Especially when I saw the sheriff, a familiar face from some creature movie. "Thrill me", I believe he always said. Okay, so thrill me. I have nothing against those old slasher movies.As the story sets its boundaries, I was still interested. Could they make something original out of it? A hilarious nude scene later, I decided it wasn't going to happen. Hope faded by the minute, and the presence of horrible horror stereotypes killed my mood. How often can you stumble and fall while being chased and/or how badly can you defend yourself? It ruined the experience, so a low rating from my side. 4 is fine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early 80s slasher returns to bore us in 3D...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So 3D first earned a wave of popularity as far back as the 1950s, when audiences surely were convinced that they were seeing the movies of the future. Now we are half a century beyond that time and 3D remains little more than a mildly interesting gimmick, and even the most recent movies can't seem to resist stopping in their tracks to give us an effect that made the original 3D audiences scream and duck, thinking things were flying at them from the screen.It's natural to assume that 3D would be most effective in a horror film, where things like knives and bullets and pick-axes and killers and come stretching toward us from the screen, but sadly it seems that the whole 3D thing might never turn into anything more than a gimmick that, as is the case here, seems primarily needed to cover up tremendous shortcomings in the rest of the movie.That being said, it's true that the movie is wildly gory, and that some of the killings are actually pretty unique and creative, which is good because until recently 3D was mostly reserved for weak family movies like the recent Journey to the Center of the Earth. I was glad to see 3D in a horror film, particularly one that wasn't afraid to use the effect to intensify some already disturbing death scenes,but the recycled story and slew of ancient horror situations are a little too much to overlook.As you know, My Bloody Valentine is a remake of a 1981 Canadian horror film of the same name which, though largely forgotten today by most people other than the most devoted horror buffs, was actually one of the better ones to come along in the slasher-movie mania of the early 1980s.The story revolves around a tragic Valentine's Day from years earlier, when a cave-in in the mining town of Harmony resulted in seven men being trapped inside, where six of them were killed by the seventh, a Harry Warden, to conserve the depleting oxygen supply. The cave-in, by the way, was caused by the mine's owner, Tom Hanniger, who left his observation post to go to the Valentine's Day dance. If you've seen Friday the 13th, that scenario might strike you as oddly familiar, but actually it's not until the killings start that the movie takes the traditional 80s horror movie route and stops making any sense whatsoever.Harry wakes up a year later from the coma he has been in since the killings and makes the logical decision to kill the hospital's staff and then head back to the mine where, get this, the pretty young cast from this movie, including Tom, also happen to be partying the night away. Yeah, I love that. There's nothing to get you going on Valentine's Day than partying it up at the site of a grueling massacre. This is the height of horror movie romance!Of course, no one really cares about the intricate plot details of the movie. The story actually has a mildly interesting set-up, but ultimately it devolves into your traditional slasher movie, with every stupid character and idiotic decision that you might expect to see.The second half of the movie moves into the thriller genre as an intricate scheme involving the town sheriffs past and present, Tom, Harry, and a girl named Sarah clouds the issue of who is the real killer after all. This story is padded with cheap horror scenes and gratuitous violence, and while the end of the movie is both an ancient horror construct and thus hugely predictable, it's still a little clever, and admittedly there are moments when it is interesting to see how the whole whodunit portion of the movie will turn out.It's true that it's almost impossible to see the killer in this movie and not think of one of the old slasher giants like Michael Meyers or Jason Voorhees having traded their William Shatner or hockey mask in for a gas mask and a respirator, but at least the technical aspect of the 3D was pulled off pretty well. It would have been more effective had the majority of the movie not been quite so dark, but there is also a Grindhouse-style over-the-topness that adds a much-needed element of goofiness to the proceedings that allow us to enjoy the gore without finding it disturbing and disgusting, like most of the Saw series or Eli Roth's stupendously crappy film Hostel. There you have horror at its most depraved and brainless.Strangely, after such a pervasive lack of originality and repetition of situations and scenes that we've seen in so many horror movies so many times before, it's really the ending that will end up bowling you over with its astonishing dumbness. I won't reveal how the movie ends, so I'll just tell you that not only is the movie's climax an enormous cheat, but it ultimately makes not a lick of sense. It's one of those situations where you might find yourself totally baffled for quite some time afterwards as you try in vain to piece together what actually happened.Despite all the copious violence, bloodshed and gratuitous nudity (oh I forgot to tell you, there's a lot of nudity in this thing), there is also a sense of honesty that derails any possibility of accusing the movie of tricking audiences into theaters. If you can see a title like "My Bloody Valentine 3D" and you don't know what to expect, then you have only yourself to blame for any disappointment!</fullReview>

Poorly acted, bad script, and just not much material for Jensen to work with. My wife though what a bad move by Ackles this movie makes Ackles look like a b actor. The movie has it share of over the top gore and sex. Not for the kids. Not very scary either. Maybe 5 out of 10 scares for me. A very predictable ending. Do not even rent My bloody Valtine. Oh well, at least I got out of the house when it was -30. Ask for a refund with this one. They use Ackles name to suck you in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie was good, gave it a 6 of 10 only because it was 3D. This is not the blue-and-red shades 3D, it is the REAL 3D, both lenses are gray. It has 4-5 points in the film where you get the shittake scared out of you, like any good slasher film. There are also the 2-3 points where u r like "man I am glad this was done in 3D". Being a PA resident I knew they would film it somewhere in PA once I saw the bridges (kind of reminded me of The Office TV series). I have seen much better horror films, and I have seen better 3D movies. My fave is actually the Freddie movie where the last 20 minutes are 3D, and Freddy's mouth opens again and again, and it flies right into your face! Good scroll of young actors, but I had a question the movie couldn't answer. Why would the miner be waiting in the truck drivers truck? How did he know he would go to his truck?????????????? Anyway, the bad guy (no spoiler LOL) does a good job of showing himself near the end of the film, I will leave it at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What I expected, and that's a good thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine is a rare case in that it was a movie that I actually think it was a GOOD idea to remake. The original has a cult following, and it was a great movie, but definitely not up in the ranks of slasher fame with Halloween or Friday the 13th. This is the kind of movie to remake, one that falls just short of it's potential. Granted much of the reason that the original never hit with the impact it should have had to do with the MPAA butchering it, but that is besides the point.My Bloody Valentine 3D was pretty much exactly what I wanted it to be. It looked, played out, and felt like a balls to the wall 80's slasher flick, and in a time that is FLOODED with remakes that don't quite hit the right notes, that is a great feat in and of itself. This means that the movie didn't pull it's punches, and really had some great gore to write home about. There are hearts ripped out, jaws ripped off, and eyes gouged out (from behind!), and all of this goes on without it ever crossing into the "torture porn" genre. This is one of the movie's strong points and was definitely the thing that the original lacked. There are also a few tips of the hat to the original in the dryer scene and a scene where hanging pieces of clothing drop down one by one as the killer stalks Sarah.The storyline itself was so-so. It felt overcomplicated and there were a lot of things that I'm not sure needed to be there, as I don't think that they really added anything to the movie. The whole thing kind of plays out like a murder mystery, with a love triangle in the middle. I like that they played up that triangle, but the murder mystery isn't as well executed as it could have been. There are a number of suspects, as the original killer is supposedly dead, having been shot and wandering into the mine ten years prior, but like I said they over complicate things. Harry Warden was the original killer, and is a suspect, because his body was never found. That is fine, I accept that, but then they bring in this side-plot about how he was tracked down and shot by the sheriff, and then buried in the woods. They go to the spot he is buried, and his body is missing. Now tell me, what was the point of that? We are right back where we started. Harry Warden is STILL a suspect. The other big thing that I thought wasn't necessary was the affair that Axel is having and the cabin out in the woods. It only shows up a few times and really isn't important to the story. I also felt that more time should have been spent in the mines, and the ending lacked a bit of "oomph" to me, based on one simple fact. They reveal the killer before he is beaten. Now that's not necessarily bad, but he plays out the climax not in the miner costume, but in his street clothes, and his street clothes just are not as scary as the mining outfit.My biggest gripe with the movie is something at the end, after the killer is revealed. Part of the explanation feels like a cop out to me, but I won't say anything else as I don't want to do any spoilers.The Real D 3D in this movie really is the most impressive part, though. I was in awe at HOW 3D it was, and there is no way to really convey that effectively in words. It's not as simply as a pick-axe flying at you every once in a while. Think of it like this, any shot that has a foreground, middle ground, and background looks fully 3D. It really immerses you in the movie and is an experience like no other. It needs to be seen.All in all, while the plot was a little janky, the characters were interesting enough to keep me entertained, and the gore and real D 3D effects were amazing. This is definitely one to see in theaters if you can find one that has it in 3D. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This version was only loosely based on the original: basically the same main characters, a few of the same scenes--but they are much older than TJ and everyone else. The entire movie I sat there going okay what's Axel's motivation in this movie because they completely changed the beginning. Well turns out Axel wasn't the killer! I was so mad but that may be because I absolutely LOVE Jensen Ackles. The actors were better accept for Axel and I hated Sarah a lot less. They didn't have the song at the end and no one said "Sarah will you be my bloody valentine" which really bothered me (the end is my favorite part). And to anyone like me who loved Mable in the original: she wasn't in it as Mable, but there is a dryer scene. Oh there's a lot more nudity in this one. Overall the plot is better because its not random killing, but I mean that's why the 80s were great. Its more psychological than the old one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>!Contains spoilers! I remember seeing the old version when I was a kid, and it scared the crap out of me. So when I found out a remake was in the works, and a 3D version to boot, I was mildly enthusiastic. Now I know that movies that scared you as a kid don't always do the same later on, so I watched it again. Not quite as scary as I remembered, but still worth the time and effort. And so we come to the remake. I know that suspension of disbelief is a key to enjoying horror flicks, and usually this is no problem for me, but come on! #1 Running naked around a motel parking lot? #2 Not being able to remember that, indeed I do have a fire alarm handy,until after the pick-Axe wielding psycho has eviscerated your coworker? #3 I am indeed an old fart that the psychopath wants dead, how shall I defend myself? I know I'll drink myself into oblivion with an unloaded shotgun! top hat, old boy! And when I hear something suspicious, I'll load said gun, walk outside, find nothing, grumble about jumping at shadows, then UNLOAD the ¤%#¤@ shotgun and go back inside to be slaughtered!#4 What's this?!?! Another old fart with the possibility of being on the list of the happy miner? I DO have a loaded gun, and police-backup, but I need not these fancy trappings of this modern age when I hear funny noises outside in the dark. I will face the killer and smite him with my ability to tremble before him and prove that incontinence diapers really, really work when he rips my jaw off.There are more, but I'm getting depressed thinking bout this movie. At least the old one had some attempts at humor on the way down the mineshaft</fullReview>

The 3D effects are not satisfying at all. Come to think of it, I think I'd rather watch it in HD quality, than watching this poor quality movie which is shown in 3D. Anyway, the storyline is idiotic and the gaming is bad. Also, if you notice it, they took the concept which was shown in Fight Club, that the main character has split personality, and gave it to Tom Hanniger. This was a poor attempt obviously. The end, which was suppose to make us want to see the second movie, wasn't good, mainly because this movie sucked!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine is one of the best slashers i've seen in along time, i've seen it twice and the 3D effect is great but i'll recommend sitting in the middle of the cinema, the first time i saw it me and my mate sat at the top row of chairs and the 3D didn't quite reach us and because we were at the same level as the screen we didn't get the full effect.The level of gore and tense shockers was the highest i've seen for ages and the 3D just adds to it, one of the best moments is when a blokes jaw gets ripped out and comes flying at you.The story is the same complex as most slashers, however it wasn't one that you could guess who the bad guy is, as normal you get a suspect who is alway conveniently in the wrong place at the right time, but the twist at the end is so absurd you wouldn't guess it, unusually in modern horrors there is full frontal nudity which hasn't happened for a while, both me and my mate thought the miner was going to stab her in the pussy, but thankfully there was none of the tasteless comedy which has ruined a lot of horror flicks recently.Performance wise all the actors and actresses are cast very well, Jensen Ackles known mainly for his role as Dean Winchester in Supernatural(Great series) performs very well as the main character Tom Harrigan he seems to a very confident actor and i think has a successful career ahead of him, Jaime King is a great actress and screams very well, she's a very pretty women which i think will effect her in doing action movies since she lacks a certain presence on screen which actresses like Milla Jovovich or Kate Beckinsale are extremely good with, however she still has time for improvement in that area.Overall i give it 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprised at what some expected. Great 3D 80s style horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't go deep into the plot because it isn't important. This movie doesn't pretend to be a smart thriller that keeps you guessing and working your mind to figure out who is doing what. It is a raw, unoriginal but awesome 80s style slasher flick that is very well done in most areas. The acting isn't Oscar worthy but it certainly wasn't bad. In fact I thought it was great by horror standards. Next, the gore is here and it is done well. The digital fx are combined nicely with traditional horror makeup fx. This is rare as I find myself bombarded by tons of crappy digital fx horror movies by the dozen over the last 5 or more years. OK, so why the high score? The movie is well paced and by that I mean fast. It starts strong and it doesn't let up. Next, I found myself impressed by the movie score. The soundtrack actually had me noticing it as far better than average and wishing I had someone next to me to ask if it was just me or did this soundtrack fit perfectly. Lastly, this movie does 3D like no movie I can remember seeing. The locations are perfect for 3D. The whole mine shaft works well and looked multi layered for a long way when you first see it. There are a couple of scenes where the camera is doing a very high shot of the mining area or the city and you can almost feel motion sickness set in as if you are on a ride and your seat is moving because you focus on a big crane or bridge and as the camera pans you feel like you are floating around it. Very cool stuff. Another notable scene, without spoiling anything is the first gore scene. It is not for the faint. You might find yourself pulling back as if you are going to get blood on your clothes. :) If you are open to a straight forward horror flick that doesn't bother slowing the pace for a deep story but would rather give the audience an abundance of gore with a slick 3D coat of paint then this will be a movie you will love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Jensen Ackles. So when I first saw the advertisement on TV I decided that I'm somehow gonna watch this. I went online and searched which cinema is the closest and at last after much anticipation went to watch it. Then....I was disappointed. The story line was OK. Jensen looked as cute as ever. But the 3D effects....not so good... I expected more! Much more! turned out to be that the scenes in the advert and a couple of others were the only actual 3D effects. i know the whole time it was slightly 3D and it looked as we were actually watching from the side but apart from that... where were the stuff that we were supposed to be scared of?? That we were supposed to duck and get out of the way to save our little selves?? The horro #D stuff?There was only one effect that made me go "yayy its 3D!"!!! The main 3 actors were pretty good at their roles but Jensen just wasn't around much. Not as much as i expected he would be as one of the main actors. I paid 2 pounds extra for the 3D effects and it just wasn't there!!! The Disney 3D show which is meant for kids made me jump up a couple of times. But this... the "horror" movie was just a big fat disappointment.</fullReview>

That's the only bad comment I have towards it. All in all, it had it. entertainment, thrills and shrills, eye candy (for both ladies and gents), good flow, good story, yada yada yada. If your a fan of Jensen Ackles...u know it's him the whole time..everyone has a very specific body type, and movement. he could be wearing the state puff marsh-mellow man costume and u could tell it was him. Especially if ur into Supernatural, u'll know wht I mean. The scene when he's locked in the cage and the murderer faces him..is a total mirror image (it's also one of my favourite scenes)and that really tips off Tom, still though...the film was going in so many directions with "who it was" that I sometimes wanted to believe it was someone else. it's an awesome film...I'm going 2 c it again tonight..and I'm hoping to go a least 2 more times after that...it's only going to be in 3D for so long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I start this review, I have to say: I'm almost 40, I've been a horror genre fan all my life, and I don't mind remakes that much as long as they actually work to make the film work by respecting genre fans. Oh, and I went to see the NOTLD 3D remake, which is probably the most insulting remake ever made! Which, fortunately, is so far from what My Bloody Valentine 3-D is...My Bloody Valentine 3-D is a true gem of a remake. It takes the original idea of the 80s version, and really remakes it into its own living thing. The story is still basically the same, but they really pushed the envelope further to tell the story in a different way and with much more fun factor to it. Gone are the endless dialogues and boring moments. The film's rhythm is really where they improved a lot on and they were able to surprise the audience at moments when you'd never expect it. Gore?: Plentyful and very well done! Killer?: An awesome killer, and so well played! Acting?: Yes, they were really good! Nudity?: Absolutely, AND it was done in a very original and fun way!The 3D effect were very well done and original and only added to the pop-corn feel of this film. Really, MBV3D is a film destined to become a long time classic in the horror genre, and hopefully will start a new trend of 3D horror films with actual fun content.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit: I went into this, being a huge fan of the original, with low expectations. But I was pleasantly surprised. The picture quality was amazing--especially the whole 3D aspect, which was not just used to show cheesy special effects, but to add depth and a realistic you-are-there look to the whole movie. Overall, I thought that the film was very fun and highly entertaining. I am not going to give out any spoilers here so you will have to GO SEE IT for yourself. I would definitely recommend it for date night! I am looking forward to next month's Friday the 13th to see if that movie does as much justice to the original as this one did to My Bloody Valentine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool 3D images end with the movie, but memories of a poor story line, bad acting, and lousy characters last a life time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, I didn't really hate this film, but I was hoping for more fun. I didn't expect a good story, but I was hoping they wouldn't have a bad one either. Let me explain what I mean by this: (Slight Spoilers) First of all the action in this movie starts real suddenly. Everything is going real slow, a group of teenagers are exploring a mine where a bunch of people died. They are in there for less than 2 minutes and BAM, killer kills somebody. We get a real exciting sequence of people running and dying, then it is over. This is where the movie goes wrong.After this we get sort of a boring story line that seems to rely on something that was not very well set up in the beginning of the movie. And for the whole movie we are guessing who the killer is. We have 2 choices, one we want it to be(Because he's a jerk), and one we don't(Because he seems like a nice enough guy).And I wasn't completely satisfied with the gore either. I was hoping for more realistic killings. Closer to what you get with the Saw movies. But the violence in this movie was incredibly fake, and obviously enhanced with computers.When the movie wraps up we find out which one the killer is, but I didn't find it very satisfying. But maybe I'm looking too far into it. But I just think that if a movie has a bad storyline, it shouldn't take up the whole movie with it. It should just deliver the gore and the cool 3D effects. I didn't plan on cringing at the end because of the bad story, I wanted to cringe because of the gore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason, cut your heart out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A "bloody" mess of an opening slaughterhouse (or slaughterhospital) that makes the following month's 'Friday the 13th' reboot say "Jason, eat (or cut) your heart out and top this," comes an actual remake that's worthy of being seen. Although no clear answer is given to why the miner goes on a killing rampage in the first act, 'My Bloody Valentine' in 3-D is still an actually good and sometime scary film, at least the 3-D version I saw it in. Not to compare a completely different genre, but similarly, both 'Bloody' and Disney's 'Chicken Little' have one thing in common: neither probably would have been a very good film without the 3-D effect. I found myself jumping at more than maybe 3-4 scenes that, without the 3-D, I might have just yawned at the unoriginality. I know female nudity (or just a few shots of males) is predominate in slasher flicks, but believe it: I found it entertaining and sometimes funny to see a full-fledged naked female running to or from utter-death. The film's main flaws involve some incredibly slow scenes involving what I suspect they refer to as shallow-character development and a somewhat odd/overused twist in the closing. I recently saw the original for the first time and I love how this took the basic premise (okay, all it took was a dressed-in-black killer miner, a former townie returning and the film's title) and shaped it into today's time and tastes. Overall, it's predictable, clichéd, gory and relies heavily on 3-D effects. And yet, I still recommend it for open-and-loose minds just looking for a fun and gruesome time. Just make sure you see it in 3-D. Otherwise, it's like you're standing in line at an amusement park while watching others have fun already on the ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the original a few days ago to get pumped for this one! I had the pleasure of seeing this with my ex-girlfriend, whom I haven't seen in eight months. (We're still friends.) We both thought this remake was pretty good. I loved all the gory deaths and thought all the deaths with the pickaxe were very creative! The remake is pretty different than the original. Ten years after a Valentine's Day Massacre, Tom Hanniger returns to Harmony to sell the coal mine. Soon after, the murders start again. Another part I loved was when the smokin' hot naked girl was running around and trying to get away from the coal miner. I didn't get to see it in 3D, but that was okay. If you love horror, gore, sex, and chocolate, I highly recommend that you be MY BLOODY VALENTINE!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing this movie is a horny preteens dream come true.On the other hand it can also be a dream come true for blood and gut lovers. I am neither but still enjoyed the movie,for I found very much humor in each an every turn. These actors and actress use no common thought what so ever. Plus the killer moves at super human speeds.This guy makes Jason look elderly,the way he kills each person off is total grossness. Please don't eat anything Italian before sitting down to this movie both 3d or 2d.I had more fear of up chucking my lunch then I did wondering weather or not he was behind someone. Other wise the movie was decent so I gave it two stars. Only because it has a major down fall(you will only notice this if you pay attention). It's a movie that has two main characters viewed as the killer. That's how anyone would view it if they weren't paying attention but for people like me who pay attention. You will soon figure out who's doing it with in mid-opening of the movie. They messed up major on trying to pin-point two people. Other then that I laughed, sadly it did not give me nightmares, watched a good porn scene with some major blood and guts. Other then that at the end of the day it's just another remake Hollywood failed at but teens and suckers like me keep buying into.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good slasher!! Comparable to what the original was in its time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very happy with this in comparison to many of the recent slasher remakes. Compared to modern day slashers, I'd say this is about as good as the original was to early 80's slashers.They kept a lot of the storyline in tact, which you can't say for many of these remake/reimaginings. No doubt, they made a good deal of changes, but they didn't go overboard...the changes all helped the story and made it feel updated, deeper.. TJ's character is Tom, Axel's the sheriff, their pasts are directly linked to Harry together, and there's still uncertainty as to whether Harry is alive or not... I don't want to ruin too much, but let me say, it gets you more involved in the plot and keeps you wondering who the killer is, in the tradition of the original.You have to see it in 3D if you have the option. The kill scenes are all made for 3D, and there's a lot of them. It's super gory..I haven't yet received my copy of the original uncut (it's on it's way!!), but I'm willing to be the R-rated version of the new one is much worse than the uncut original. A good deal of hot chick nudity too!! All in all, I really liked it. If you're a big slasher fan and like the original, it's great foreplay for the upcoming F13th!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coming off of The Unborn last weekend, I think I could watch water boil and be entertained. I'm giving this a solid 7 tho. The only thing I didn't like is the set-up. The original was much more imaginative AND believable i.e. Harry Warden went insane from having to survive on the flesh of co-workers. In this remake, it sounds as if he just snaps and kills his co-workers for no reason. The whole cannibal spin was dropped entirely and it's a shame as it adds to the creepiness of it all. The 3-D was comical in a Looney Tunes sort of way... nothing to really make you jump out of your seat but if you can catch a 3-D matinée, I'd say go for it. The surprise ending was a tad silly but it was a fun ride... had me going for a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Bloody Valentine 3D was Awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked a couple of miles to the Bow Tie Cinema in Parkchester to see this movie. At 12 degree temperatures I nearly froze my butt off on opening day. But it was worth it :-) The movie keeps you at the edge of your seat. There's plenty of gore and horror right off the bat. The murder scenes are amazingly gruesome. Probably the best I've seen in horror flicks in a long time. My favorite is the one where the killer severs a girl's head by driving a shovel into her mouth.Jensen Ackle's performance was superb and I'm not just saying this because I'm a huge fan of his. In the end you don't know who the killer is. It could be Kerr Smith who plays the sheriff or it could be Jensen Ackle's character Tom. It's up to a girl with a gun to choose who is who. I was not expecting the killer to be Jensen Ackles. It turns out the man has a split personality. He escapes in the end leaving us to wonder and hope that we get to see a sequel to this movie.I rate it a ten out of ten for superb acting for everyone, the raunchy sex scene and most of all the suspense and horror make up effects.Today I went to see it in 3D and all I can say is Wow! The quality of the 3D is the best I've ever seen. I don't think I've been this excited since I went on the Back to the Future ride at Universal. I can only hope that the DVD comes out in 3D as well. It actually felt like I was close to the actors. Let me tell you when the axe pick comes at you or the blood splatters you can't help but jump and be startled. It is extremely fun as well as horrifying. The story line is great. The actors, all of them are great, specially Jensen Ackles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1981 original version of My Bloody Valentine was a passable horror movie about a madman returns to kill on valentine's day.This 3D remake version is surely made only for 3D if you watch this in 3d it's a 7 movie if not it's a 5 movie.Well what went good? it contains some suspense and scary moments (the store sequence for example),some decent acting and the exaggerated violence and sex scenes are entertaining to watch in 3D.What went wrong? as i said in the previous line the violence and sex scenes are great to watch in 3D but in the normal version will surely seem over the top and exaggerated and surely a bit tedious especially the violence which is truly bloody and then there's the ending, the original didn't contained a great ending to begin with but this one stretched credibility to the top and copied other movies in this genre.</fullReview>

The screenplay is ridiculous and the acting is cheap and terrible. Scenes in 3D completely forced to entertain the public with glass pieces flying outside of the screen and other stuff like this.To each day that passes producers and directors are obtaining to destroy the original movies with remakes such as "Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday The 13th, Halloween, etc" and now My Bloody Valentine in 3D, what a crap!!! The next horror-remake is "Nightmare on Elm Street" and I sincerely don't have many hopes. I only wait that he's not in 3D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst horror remakes of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Castle perfected the horror movie gimmick in the fifties, half a century later Lionsgate tries to take the horror movie gimmick to the phase with the horrible My Bloody Valentine 3-D. 3-D in horror films is nothing new as most horror buffs know Friday The 13th Part 3 &amp; Piranha II: The Spawning were both released in the eighties in 3-D. While there are a few cool shots in the movie, nothing really jumped out at me and made me saw WOW! My Bloody Valentine was filmed in REALD and while it's not the first film to be filmed in this format, it doesn't have anywhere near the success that Journey To The Center Of The Earth had last summer. Watching the film it became apparent that the format has yet to be perfected and I'm hoping that when Avatar &amp; Final Destination 4 are released later this year in REALD, that movie studios have worked out all the bugs. As for the film itself, it's just your run of the mill slasher film with dumb characters, pointless nudity and horrible acting. I've never been one to down a so bad it's good slasher film as I rank both the Sleepaway Camp &amp; Slumber Party Massacre series high in my guilty pleasures book, but watching My Bloody Valentine was more painful than a New Kids On The Concert. Jensen Ackles from the hit WB series Supernatural gives a horrible acting debut performance as Tom. I didn't go into this movie expecting Ackles to have the same dramatic prowse of say Brando or Penn but, Ackles lines are amateurish in delivery and he doesn't have the experience or the talent to carry this movie. In the female lead role, Jamie King doesn't display the type of courage needed for a female horror heroine and I was just waiting for her untimely demise, which sadly doesn't happen. Finally Kerr Smith shows why he hasn't had a decent acting job, since his days on Dawson's Creek. Lionsgate should be ashamed of themselves for remaking My Bloody Valentine, as the remake gives the original a bad name. Horror films are supposed to be so bad there good, sadly My Bloody Valentine ranks as the worst horror remake since Dark Water; with the added 3-D effect it gains 1 ? star but other than that it's a waste of time of money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in not expecting much and I really can't say that I was wrong. This movie followed every horror cliché imaginable with every character tripping to the ground at least once and exploring dark areas alone. I thought we were past that but I guess not. The acting isn't worth mentioning except the line when the bad guy dies "Nooooooooooo!" What really ticked me off though is the """""""Twist""""""""ending. I won't ruin it but it basically involves the movie bold face lying to you about a scene earlier. This was just lazy writing where the screen writer wrote himself into a corner and the only way he could get out of it was to disavow what the audience saw earlier. I gave it a two though for the fact that the 3D for what little they did and repeated multiple times (you will lose track of how many times a flash light is pointed at you in 3D), a couple of times it was done well. I couldn't imagine how bad a movie it would be without the 3D gimmick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having watched a small number of 3D titles prior to this in the Waterloo Imax (and having been impressed by those films), i expected this film to be something to 'shout about'. The 3d aspect in this film (compared to the other films i watched (i don't know perhaps i was expecting to much)was very poor. The trailer made it out to be as if objects look as if they truly are flying towards you, but this was not the case. However it is the storyline (and i use that word very loosely) of this film which is the main thing to complain about, it has more holes in it then a fishnet and is incredibly predictable, the fact that they can even call this a film astounds me and if i am alone in my view the fact that any fan of this 'film' can call themselves a film fan astounds me further. If 3D is to be the future of cinema (even though its been out since the 80's) then it needs to be greatly improved upon ( all i found it to do in this title was lower the films definition slightly ). Anyway, back to the point this film is honestly not worth seeing to stare at a wall for 2 hours would be much better entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unoriginal slasher film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I've seen numerous 3D movies in Florida where objects literally came at you that had me dodging and at some points I had to turn away cause it was so real. Not one scene did I even slightly flinch. I'm assuming the people who enjoyed this film have never seen a 3D movie so they don't understand what 3D technology has to offer. I've seen 3D movies where snakes were slithering towards you and it looked as though it was less an inch away from your face. People are loving it because of the gore. Because now-a-days gore is what horror movies are about. All the horror movies lately are all gore and no plot or originality. This is what horror has come to; gore, nudity, and cheap CGI scares. The horror genre has changed, I don't even consider half the movies horror. They don't make movies like they used too; The Shining, Exorcist, Halloween, Nightmare On Elm Street, Evil Dead. People find movies now-a-days scary? If they think these are scary they should watch the masters of horror, the Japanese. Shutter (NOT the remake, 2004 version), Ringu, Ju-On, Gin gwai, Tale of Two Sisters....they will **** there pants.What amazes me is how people say they liked the script and acting. The acting is some of the worst acting I've ever seen. And I loved how every time the killer is chasing someone they fall down, literally every time. The script was your basic slasher script, nothing original. Throughout the whole movie it's just scenes of oh...heres the killer chasing some idiot who trips over everything, screaming while the killer is in her face and doesn't even attempt to get away. Thats all the movie is, a bunch of random death scenes. Completely unoriginal movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie was a good movie and was pretty gory. i was expecting that by the title "my BLOODY valentine." The kills were kind of predictable though. If you think about it the movie is pretty dumb though because the people were so dumb. for example- when the naked girl ran why did she run into a room? and she had a chance to run when he killed the short woman but stayed under the bed. In the market when the main character was running which she was running in place cause it wasn't that hard to tell and when the Maggie went under the gate thing isn't it quite obvious he's gonna pop up there. Don't even get me started on the ending, so retarded. She was running calling her husband for help and not the police but just him? Wow your brave..She and the gun in her hand and while the 2 guys were fighting she just stood there until her husband got stabbed then she decided to shoot which she missed and had 1 bullet left, she finally shoots and Boom something explodes and yet THEY ALL LIVE!!! but i still like all the killing so 7/10</fullReview>

They saw it all happening to them, but it turned out they were doing it. It's stupid and ridiculous and boring at this point. It's no fun when it turns out that's what is happening. I really loved the movie until it turned out that Tom was the killer because he was "possessed" by the memory of harry. I am glad I never bought this movie, for that would be a total waste of money.

		<fullReview>This film is the classic slasher horror which has enough fake blood and guts to make Jason Vorhees squeamish. From the way in which the killer dispatches his victims to his miners garb, it all makes for a thoroughly creepy and bloody experience. Although you see a woman full frontal for at least ten or fifteen minutes of the film, and the main characters are so insipid you don't really care if they die; Jensen Ackles makes it all worth while because he's so gorgeous and actually is the best actor in the film (which doesn't take much). The throw back to the horrors of the 70s and 80s are very apparent here. But while many will criticize this film for it's somewhat predictable ending, this movie really is very enjoyable and good for a Saturday night in.</fullReview>

"My Bloody Valentine" is pretty standard horror fare, but the 3D gimmick was the movie's saving grace, in my opinion.I had a good time watching this movie, as I'd never watched a movie in 3D before, and I thought the 3D was well done. The movie itself manages to have a few pretty exciting scenes in it, particularly the scene inside the grocery store.Overall, was it a great movie? Of course not, but you should expect that going into it. Is it a good time? Yeah, especially if you're watching it in 3D, and you're with a group of friends or on a date.

		<fullReview>Considering that this is one of the first horror films that I've braved the cinemas to see (normally I wait to rent them so I don't make a fool of myself in the theatre), this one didn't really disappoint.The 3D aspect of the film was awesome! I mean, watching pick-axe's fly at your head or someone eye pop out right in front of your face is pretty awesome! It made the movie go from typical, corny teen horror film to a step up.The one thing I didn't like was I found the ending, while not predictable (it's anything but that... you'll be debating right up until the last minutes trying to figure out who the killer is), the reasoning or cause of the killer's motives has been overdone. I don't want to completely spoil the end, but I will say that if you've seen Secret Window or Hide and Seek, then it's a really old explanation of motive. O h, and of course he gets away at the end, and no one notices... setting up the ominous sequel vibe. Other than that, it's a good time, jump-in-your-seat horror film that has that extra kick because it's in 3D. Good thing to go see in a big group.</fullReview>

Normally I could care less about a story like this, but there are special circumstances when concerned with the update of My Bloody Valentine and that would be the addition of a little abbreviation that goes by the name of 3D. Only when people I trust started saying that the gimmick was effectively used did I even acknowledge the small interest of checking it out. Since my last foray in seeing real human actors in three-dimensions was the abysmally flat, cardboard-like final reel of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, I'll just say I wasn't too enthused to give the technique a second chance. However, James Cameron's Avatar is only a couple years away, so the technology must have improved ? right? The answer to that is: by leaps and bounds. I just wish the vehicle utilizing it could have been a bit more interesting.If I am going to say anything really positive about My Bloody Valentine 3D it is going to concern the 3D. Granted, motion still gets a bit blurred and unfocused, but I believe that will be improved, otherwise, there is a lot to like. I credit Lussier from not shying away from really going for the aesthetic fully. Multiple uses of fences or steel cages obstruct our view in order to show depth; a few of the gruesome deaths contain body parts flying out at us, (the blood spurts could have been rendered better); and the pickaxe which doubles as the prime weapon of choice finds itself in the audience's face often. What really impressed me, though, was the rendering of light. The sheen that covers glass and other reflective surfaces is quite impressive, lending itself a realistic transparency as well as a tactile surface quality. And the lights, especially that of our killer's headlamp, are perfect. Even the lens flares have depth to them, superimposing onto what's beneath them as part of a higher layer. You really do find yourself lost in the screen at times, a round of applause all around.Unfortunately, one doesn't go to the movies to necessarily be wowed by effects and lulled into not seeing the numerous problems that shiny toy hides beneath it. The story is very generic?the college-aged son of a small town, (Harmony is such a blatantly tongue-in-cheek name), coal mine owner makes a mistake leaving a group of workers trapped in an underground collapse. All die except one man, found in a coma, who is later deemed to have killed the rest with his pickaxe in order to save the limited air for himself. A year later, on Valentine's Day?the title isn't completely unnecessary after having much more meaning in the original incarnation, at least I infer it did from the plot synopsis I read?Harry Warden awakens and kills 22 people before being lost in another cave-in, finally dead after a failed attempt to kill Tom Hanniger, the boy who's accidental misstep left him there the first time.Ten years go by and the survivors all find themselves back in town and face to face with a restart of the slayings. Tom has returned to sell the mine, his ex-girlfriend has married a jealous rival from the past who is now the town's sheriff, and it appears Harry Warden is back from the dead, looking to get his revenge once and for all. It is all very convenient and sadly poorly acted in most instances. Even Kevin Tighe, a recognizable character actor, comes off a bit flat, at times hamming it up for the camera, especially at the end when drunk with a shotgun. An almost unrecognizable Jamie King is the love interest of newly returned Tom from his decade-long self-exile and Sheriff Axel Palmer. She is actually pretty good, I was just completely surprised when I saw King's name in the end credits. Kerr Smith's Axel is effective if not obvious and Jensen Ackles' Tom is really quite bland and wooden. Maybe that was a conscious decision in order to undergo a slight transformation at the end?which was acted nicely?but I think the playing it dull was just too soulless.As for the scares, everything is pretty generic, yet shown in fun ways. A lot of deflection is utilized so that you expect a jump-scare moment to come only to be disappointed. However, in that split second your anxiety has lifted, the scare then arrives. The beat was off just enough to keep the scares fresh and it was appreciated. When it comes to the blood, you will definitely not be disappointed. My favorite bit of gore happens very near the beginning and it involves a shovel and a pretty girl's face ? let's just say that sets the stage for what can and will occur as the film progresses.One goes to a genre flick like this to have fun with the blood, gore, and nudity. My Bloody Valentine 3D doesn't hold back in regards to any of those, so rest assured you're in for a fun ride. I laughed a lot and enjoyed the effects work with many axe-swinging fatalities. However, the real winner coming out of it is the 3D work. Besides a couple stale moments of a slow panning gun eventually being pointed at you the audience member, it is astonishing to experience. I can't wait to see the technology as part of a more high-brow feature, but for now, a little horror flick isn't too bad to give you that first taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't see what was "SO FANTASTIC!" about it....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen the first but I suppose now a days the only thing directors of "horror" movies can come up with is using remakes. I found it almost satirical, like it was making fun of how terrible the movie really was. Perhaps the producers of Scary Movie could do something with it and actually make it worth while. The plot slowed down and I was not scared once, all I could think about was when it would end. The acting was bordered on pathetic by the whole cast and in comparison to other remakes (of course) horror movies, it could have had the possibility to be a lot better. The 3d animation should have been a lot more often, that, I think, would have been the only thing that would have kept me on "the edge of my seat." Has this new era of horror movie making come down to only thinking of remakes to use and then using all of the predictable acts in which it actually loses it's appeal into a comedy?! I just can't believe how everyone seems to have come to a liking of this absolute crap! They didn't even go into WHY the Harry guy started killing those people, they had ONE flashback that had NO relevance and as the plot unfolded, it became sluggish and only left the question of which guy did it. They really messed up towards the end when he apparently got blown up and then miraculously had not one burn on his body to which he poorly indicated that there will be a sequel. Sorry but I thought it a complete waste of money, save the glasses however.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WTF is Going on Here?!?!?!?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this film with extremely low expectations giving that the original My Bloody Valentine is pretty much a mediocre film at best. Why do you think there weren't ever any sequels? So now, nearly 30 years later, we are given a remake/sequel. It just makes me wary. I have, however, been impressed with a few ("few" being the operative term) horror films of late, and decided to give it a go.Now, the "WTF is going on here" summary line isn't about the movie specifically, but the admission price. I live in Houston, Texas where the average evening-time ticket price is about $8 (and I can usually catch matinées for less than $4), but was sucker-punched with an $11.50 price for the ticket. Mind you, this was at a 4:30pm matinée! I understand the cost being higher to compensate for the 3D glasses, but they ask you to turn the glasses back in when you leave (under the guise of "thinking green", no less). Did I turn my glasses in? Hell no. For the most expensive matinée I've ever been to, I'm keeping a souvenir.If people in New York or Los Angeles or wherever else are stupid enough or resigned-to-the-fact-that's-what-prices-are enough to pay that much for a movie ticket, more power to them, but down here, that's pretty much highway robbery. Add to that, the general rudeness of people in the theater: (an example) two obnoxious girls sitting next to my friends and me (yes, that's correct, it's not "my friends and I") spent the entire movie text-messaging their friends. No kidding. Every minute and a half, there was a bright glare on the inside of my 3D glasses. Not the fault of the filmmakers or the theater, it just diminishes the experience.A note to rude people: TURN OFF YOUR F'N PHONES OR STAY THE HELL OUT OF THE THEATER. THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD BESIDES YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS. YOU ARE NOT MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVERYONE ELSE, NOR IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO TALK ABOUT WITH PEOPLE SO IMPORTANT THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO RUIN THE Movie-going EXPERIENCE FOR EVERYONE ELSE.A note to the two girls sitting in the back row at the 4:30 matinée of My Bloody Valentine 3D at the AMC 30 on I-45 and Beltway 8 in Houston on Saturday, January 17th 2009: YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW LUCKY YOU WERE THAT I WAS THERE. MY FRIEND IS A RECOVERING SKIN-HEAD WHO STILL HAS SOME OF HIS MORE OFF-THE-WALL TRAITS. YOU ALMOST LOST YOUR PHONE. NO KIDDING. IT'S JUST RUDE. Not that you care or anything. If you did, you wouldn't have been using them anyway.On to the movie... Considering a cast of relative unknowns and B- or C-list actors, the acting was decent. The writing was okay although there wasn't much of a story going on. Let's face it; the "who's the killer? is is guy-a or guy-b?" routine has been done 1000 times before and it's been done better. Way better. The gore/violence/schlock factor was high, but not the highest I've ever seen by any means, although most of it was done well. But, I still pine for the days of Tom Savini, Stan Winston and Dick Smith. Where's Greg Nicotero when you need him? Overall, I would say that My Bloody Valentine 3D is better than the original My Bloody Valentine, but still falls flat on its face when compared to the great horror films. It's just difficult to rate a movie with high stars if you have to pay three times as much to see it as you did for a better movie the week before.I hope the Friday the 13th remake is better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun movie if all you care about is 3D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in to this movie having not done much research on it and thinking that it would be a fun movie to see in 3D. Starting off from the beginning the introduction credits looked promising and got me excited to see a decent slasher flick, unfortunately I was wrong. Not only was the acting sub-par but the actual script was way below then expected. I mean I knew that it would have Academy Award winning dialogue in it but c'mon. It seemed that even a fourth grader could predict what was going to happen next. Combined with the intense gore scenes and the cool 3D effects keep most of the audience intrigued about the whole 3D idea, but as people were leaving, everybody seemed to feel like they had wasted money. I still give it a three out of ten because the 3D effects were put together very well and I commend Jim Emswiller, the sound designer, for doing a great job with mixing the sound and using 5.1 surround sound while using 3D.Overall, I am excited to see what happens next in the film industry with 3D technology and I will be for sure seeing Henry Selick's Coraline in a couple of weeks when it too comes out in 3D. It is going to be interesting what other people think about this film and how it does in the box office from opening weekend to the week after.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worth the eye candy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like so many in the slasher genre, this movie couldn't decide on a tone. The intentionally comical violent scenes are poorly unbalanced by the seriousness of the characters. There is no comic relief here, just 3D eye candy that fails to deliver. The result is a dry concoction of plot and character that loses the audience's attention quickly. It is impossible to care about the story or those involved, but rather the viewers will just glance at their watches until the next death scene.In regards to the photography, the 3D is effective and sharper than most seen today (compared to Bolt, Beowulf, etc), perhaps because it involves live action. The effects on the other hand range from somewhat amusing to unforgivably bad (in the tradition of Jaws 3).The movie is obviously intended for teens, but after a few murders even the younger crowd will be embarrassed for the filmmakers' petty attempts to win a few laughs/screams. The film might be a big video hit for parties or get-togethers, but between death scenes you'll find yourself making a lot of beer runs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Boring Valentine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* Just to get it out of the way: I saw this film in 2-D, thus cannot comment on the 3-D aspect.It's hard to review My Bloody Valentine. Almost everyone who goes to see it will be expecting nothing but unabashed fun, gore, sex, and laughs. If I look at the film that way, I guess it somewhat delivered. Big emphasis on the SOMEWHAT. But if I look at My Bloody Valentine with the same mindset I judge every movie I see, I can't help but realize how completely disappointing it was. As an overall fun experience, I'd have much rather spent my doing something retarded with friends, like attempting to steal a walrus from the zoo or something. My point is that My Bloody Valentine just isn't fun to watch. It plays into every single tired horror idea you've seen countless times, and mixes in a bunch of soap opera elements for no apparent reason whatsoever. People cheating on their spouses, melodramatic father/son moments, boyfriends/girlfriends with relationship problems? who really cares? And all this melodramatic crap takes up more than half the movie. I felt more like I was watching Laguna Beach than a balls-to-the-wall modern slasher. If there is anything that sucks the fun out of My Bloody Valentine faster than anything else, it's these ultra-boring melodramatic scenes. People complain that without them, the movie would have no plot. They would be right. But the movie didn't have a plot to start with, so who cares? I'd rather see 75 minutes of pure manic massacring than 101 minutes of massacre mixed with melodrama any day. Pure massacre is fun. Massacre mixed with melodrama held my interest for about 15 minutes, and then I was ready to walk out of the theater and demand my money back. I really wish I had.The other problem with My Bloody Valentine was the lame kills. People are raving on and on about how gory this movie is, but, I'm sorry, the kills were all generic and boring. I was decently impressed with the amount of violence?that was a little above average?but there was next to no actual gore. Someone is stabbed with the pickax: you see an airborne stream of blood, then the camera quickly cuts away. Every single time. There is no graphic detail; there is no gory after effects; it's all quick and painless and pointless. There is one scene where the director builds up a single kill for ten minutes, and then the payoff kill is as generic, quick, and boring as imaginable. This movie has no "insane violence!" It has boring violence. Again, there is no fun there.The story was creative back in the 80s, and I do give the original My Bloody Valentine credit for that. But in 2009, the remake lacks anything even mildly different from what we've seen before. Where is the fun in the familiar? It's like repeating a joke you've heard before?it's stale.Possibly the only good thing I have to say about My Bloody Valentine is that it has style. When it uses the Valentine's Day theme, it nails it. The opening scene in the hospital was one of the greatest massacre scenes in horror history. The scenes with the boxes of chocolate are extraordinary. The photos of the heart-shaped tub kill is beautiful. However, the Valentine's Day theme is used so little it's very easy to forget about it. It's sad, really, because if they had used it more prevalently, the movie would have been so much better.Overall, My Bloody Valentine is far from a terrible movie, but it's just not fun to watch. It's boring. It's repetitive. It's annoying. But despite every single negative thing I just said, My Bloody Valentine is so far superior to the other modern 80s rehashes, it's hard for me to complain. I'd take this over all the Wrong Turns and Hatchets combined. If you must watch a modern slasher, this is the definitive one. But if you're a true horror fan who wants nothing but to see the genre furthered with intelligence and originality, and, in this case, fun, then you shouldn't waste your time in Harmony. Don't even consider it.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prototypical slasher movie, with 3D added...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take director Patrick Lussier, a disciple of Wes Craven and John Carpenter and maker of many mediocre horror movies. Add mediocre horror writers. Add weak cast of good-lookin' vanilla actors. Now add 3D technology. What you get is a good old slasher film. I have never been a fan of Lussier but I would say this is his best work ever as a director. The movie starts rather weakly with usual clichés but keeps on going forward and before long takes a sustainable direction. It never elevates to classic status but is above average in some respects.With an edgier director injecting more personality and with a better cast, this could have been even better. As it is, it's an honest slasher with a semblance of story rather than just a killer chasing around victims. With a few twist and turns in the story, a no holds barred R-rating and interesting 3D effects, My Bloody Valentine is good horror entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grindhouse trash that should be trashier, but it'll do in 3D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Word of advice: don't go to see My Bloody Valentine in a regular theater. Or even on DVD unless if it's just with a bunch of friends with some beer. It may be ironic of me, but even at just 2 stars I would recommend seeing My Bloody Valentine the remake as it is advertised: in 3D. The filmmakers know that this is trash from the get-go, and they decide the best way to pump it up with horror movie steroids is to make people put on the glasses and create an onslaught of senseless and tasteless killing scenes that try to find new ways to kill people with axes. On this level the picture is respectable as trash, but in a way they almost don't go far enough: on a scale of 1 to 10 this movie is a 7, even with the 3D. What this needed to be was the most god-awful piece of crap ever, with horrible dialog and violence that could offend the most liberal mother out there. Instead it's... another slasher movie with some *splashy* special effects.This also means please, for the love of Pete, do *not* go into this expecting anything in way of story or characters. The whole gist of the story is this: "WHO" is the miner killer stalking people on Valentine's Day 10 years after his supposed death/disappearance? Is it this gentlemen who has come back to town since leaving 10 years ago? hmm... I wouldn't hope that would spoil anything, but who's to say I did? Maybe for some who haven't been too exposed to many horror or slasher movies this mystery may act tricky and keep them guessing. For everyone else, it's just plain ol' stupid and leading up to an ending that is second only to Saw III as being most idiotic "Flashback-Explains-Everything" kind of resolution. But then again, why would anyone watch this for things like performances (though, oddly enough, not all of them are completely terrible, which adds to the frustration of the script being true "blah")? It's an excuse to just throw up newly refined killings and some cheesy dialog and random appearances and JUMP surprises, and from a *remake* of a horror movie from the 80s that has a spotty record with fans anyway, and on those terms it's not quite as bad as you might expect. Or, perhaps, it *is* as bad as you'd expect, but it was hard for me not to laugh incredibly through the whole 3D experience. It's great fun as a near guilty pleasure ride, and what it looks to be in every other aspect. 5.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a kids movie, though you wouldn't have known that from all the children at my theater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"My Bloody Valentine 3D" is a decent slasher movie with decent visual effects. The 3D images are used successfully, but most of the time you can figure what weapon, object or body part is going to suddenly fly off the screen and into your face. The story is pretty standard for horror movie fair. It has a "who-dunnit" kind of plot, and decent acting at best. Better than most of the dreck that is in the slasher category, but that isn't saying much.But what I found most interesting about this film isn't the movie itself, but the audience that attended the showing this afternoon at my local theater. I was amazed at how many young children, and I'm not talking about teenagers, but around 10 or younger were brought to this obviously violent and bloody movie. I haven't seen that many horror movies in theaters, I went to this one mainly to check out the 3D effects, but I don't understand why any parent or guardian would bring their children to a movie where, for example, one of the female victim runs around completely nude (ahem...full frontal) as a pick-ax wielding killer stalks her. Or another girl getting her head bisected by a shovel. Or a man getting a pick-ax through his chin and then having his jaw ripped off. I can go on. Not that one would be able to tell that these graphic scenes exist from the trailers and commercials playing on TV, but still it's pretty obvious that this is not intended for children.I wonder if these parents thought it would be OK with the whole 3D thing, making it more of a novel experience than a horror movie, or they just didn't want to get a babysitter for their little runts. Either way, I don't get it. Certainly parents should raise their own kids how they see fit, but it just shows that despite the rating system, movie studios and movie theaters don't care if kids see these films. I don't have kids myself, but I certainly would think twice about bringing my young child to a movie called "My Bloody Valentine."Oh well, whatever. At least I don't have to deal with any kids waking me up in the middle of the night screaming about nightmares with gas-mask wearing, pick-ax throwing psychos.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not much for horror remakes(this one's based off of an '81 horror film of the same name), including that horrible Prom Night remake last year, but My Bloody Valentine 3-D was bloody, gory fun. The story is about a man named Tom Hanniger who returns to the mining town of Harmony, U.S.A. 10 years after miner Harry Warden went crazy on Valentine's Day and killed 22 men, women, and teens. Now more people are dying after Tom's return and it could just be Warden committing these new murders. Or is it? I viewed this film in both 2-D and 3-D formats and the latter is by far the best choice. The kills are great and add for some of the cool 3-D effects(i.e. a guy takes a pickax in the jaw and it gets ripped off and thrown at the audience). The gory scenes could actually make one who's faint of heart hurl up their popcorn.I also enjoyed the little bits of humor injected into the film, including a 5+ minute scene with a fully nude Betsy Rue. The acting is somewhat wooden, but that happens in most 3-D films these days. Overall, My Bloody Valentine 3-D is an enjoyable experience with scares, laughs, and a heart.....a bloody heart in a candy box, that is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i saw the trailer on TV i couldn't wait to watch it. This being the first new 3D movie. I enjoyed the 3D effects that was coming out of the screen. I thought that it was very good what they came from, to what they have now.If i had to pick and problems with the movie, it would be the way that the victims were running away from the killer. They wasn't really running. They was walking fast and they always trip them selves up. That made me angry. The woulds that i shouted out was "For F*ck Sake". I couldn't believe that they still do that. I remember in the Freddy films all the girls ran at about 6mph. That was in the 80's. They should of thought of something else.Also from my own opinion, i didn't think that the movie was scary. I didn't jump at all. But the girl that was sat next to me, every loud sound that came from the screen she was always jumping. My girlfriend thought that it was scary. She said that it was the way that they told the story.The reason why i have given it a 5 was because because of the slow running and the falling over.The movie is worth seeing once. But once is enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern 3-D remake of early 80's slasher.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I was never a fan of "My Bloody Valentine"-at least its widely available heavily cut version.The original was released uncut on DVD not long ago,so I may give it another chance pretty soon.Ten years ago,the lone survivor of a horrible cave-in,Harry Warden awoke from his coma went on a killing spree that devastated the tiny mining town of Harmony.There were over 20 people killed in one night.Among the few that survive are Tom,Sarah, Axel and Irene.Ten years later.Sarah and Axel got married and Axel is the sheriff.The one thing tying Tom to Harmony is Hanniger Mines.Tom owns it after the death of his father),the massacre happened there and it's the only thing keeping Harmony afloat.Harry Warden's back and he's looking to get his revenge on the survivors of his previous massacre.The script of "My Bloody Valentine" remake offers tons of clichés and the characters are unsurprisingly one-dimensional.The film has plenty of blood and gore as the victims are killed and dismembered with Harry Warden's pick-axe.Betsy Rue provides some lovely full-frontal nudity and 3-D effects are spectacular.Bullets come flying at the viewer.Pick axes come flying towards the viewer.Breasts come flying towards the viewer.It's great that after directing such inane load of crap like "Dracula 2000" Patrick Lussier finally made an enjoyable slasher film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who would've thought it? A VERY GOOD horror film remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom (Jensen Ackles) returns to his home town of Harmony ten years after a mad miner went on a massacre and killed 22 people. When he returns the murders start up again. Sheriff Axel (Kerr Smith) who was once his friend thinks he's doing them. Meanwhile Tom's ex Sarah (Jaime King), who's now married to Axel, thinks Tom is innocent.The original "My Bloody Valentine" came out in 1981. It was a low-budget horror film that was cut to ribbons by the MPAA. Virtually all the killings were either shortened or eliminated entirely. (The original director said it should have been retitled "My Bloodless Valentine") Nevertheless the film worked. I saw it opening night in 1981 and remember it scaring me silly. Now, 26 years later, we get a 3-D remake. I expected the worst but was surprised at how good it was! The story was changed and is a little needlessly convoluted and Smith is a TERRIBLE actor. But, those two things aside, this was great! The MPAA seems to be apologizing for what they did to the 1981 original. The gore in here is REAL extreme and over the top--the most I've ever seen in an R rated film. Also in 3-D it's even more explicit (the 3-D works incredibly well). Two murders cut from the original film--a pickax through an eye and a woman killed in a dryer--are recreated here and shown in full detail! I personally found all the gore hard to take seriously and was actually laughing at the more over the top ones. Also this movie knows its audience--it has all the slasher movie clichés and barrels through them at lightning speed! There are no long boring searches through dark houses or rooms. The ones here are done quick and violent--one in a supermarket actually scared me! The killer runs after his victims at full speed too--he doesn't just casually walk after them like Jason or Myers do. The ultimate solution seemed pretty stupid--but I'm not complaining. Also there's good acting by Ackles (who had a hard role) and King was just excellent. Also a great scene, for some audience members, has a completely nude woman is chased by the killer. And yes--everything is shown in detail.A kick-a**, gory, strong and (most importantly) scary horror film! I give this a 9. A must for horror fans. The 3-D version is the only way to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Bloody Valentine..2 D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Ward, a miner who gained notoriety for killing the men with him after a mine collapsed so that he could have further air, slaughters an entire hospital staff before returning to the scene of the crime, claiming the lives of partying teens, before being shot by then-sheriff, Burke(Tom Atkins)as he was about to murder Tom Hanniger(Jensen Ackles). Ten years pass and Tom returns home days after his father's funeral(..the man who owned the mine)on the verge of signing away the mine to outside contractors, in a sense selling the nearby town's livelihood in the process. Murders begin again, as a psychopath donning a miner's outfit and gas mask destroys victims with a pick-axe. Tom is an obvious suspect since the murders didn't start up until he returned from wherever he was at for a decade(..a great portion of this time is an important plot-point I won't reveal). A complicated love-triangle develops as Tom's former girlfriend, Sarah(Jaime King),is now married to Axel(Kerr Smith), the sheriff of the town..Axel was in love with Sarah when she was dating Tom, and this unease that exists when all three are together after so long is of significance to the overall plot as this film continues.Formula slasher, extremely well made with all the Hollywood extravagances on display. I think the film lives and dies on it's 3 D gimmick and cashes in on the exhilaration of what such effects bring to an audience in search of entertainment. I don't, however, expect such a film to have legs once the gimmick is removed and those who left the theater experiencing weapons and body parts flying at them from the screen, will probably revisit it and realize that it isn't much more than that. I was certainly joyfully surprised to see such grisly violence on display, but the gore is mostly used during the 3 D process such as when an eyeball pops out of a head or a lower jaw is pulled apart. The film is essentially a series of chases between the psycho miner and victims fleeing for their lives. The costume and mask still delivers like in the original film and that pickaxe is used effectively. There are some hideous displays of carnage, the aftermath of the killer's attacks, with victims' chests ripped open, and hearts in candy boxes. Startling sequence featuring Betsy Rue in full frontal nudity, reacting negatively to a trucker who taped them having sex in a cheap hotel. Many of the set pieces are expertly crafted such as the supermarket chase where the killer stalks Sarah and her check-out girl, Megan(Megan Boone; who is secretly having an affair with Axel)throughout and a homage to the original film has miner outfits falling down as Sarah attempts to get away from the killer who follows her into a mine tunnel. I don't think many will be surprised at who the killer is;you'd have to be pretty dense not to recognize it right away. The pickaxe is used as the primary weapon often in 3 D coming towards the screen. Great seeing vets, Tom Atkins and Kevin Tighe(..as old miner, Ben Foley, a good friend of Tom's father)showing up in the movie, providing the film with memorable exits. I couldn't take Kerr Smith serious as a town sheriff, he's just a bit too young and heading a criminal investigation of a serial killer, Axel seems just a bit too immature and volatile for an old-school mining town to tolerate as a man of authority. But, the excellent bit of casting in my mind was Jaime King as the "final girl"..her scene alone, awestruck at seeing her old beau, Tom, again after a decade shows the richness of such a performance. I think King is the glue that holds this cast together, and provides a dramatic backbone that gives credence to so-so dialogue. Some bizarre moments exist such as the memorable murder of a dwarf hotel manager and the use of a mattress spring bed frame as protection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, It was corny, clichéd, annoying and stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some spoilers here.OK, so My Bloody Valentine in "3-D" is a remake of a 1981 slasher. I have the misfortune of not seeing it in 3D; well I basically had the misfortune of seeing it anyway. If you see it in 3D you will hate it because the effects are really bad. I laughed at it. If I did see it in 3D, I may have enjoyed it a little but more. The acting was bad. Jensen Ackles makes reallllly bad facial expressions that made me cringe. Kerr Smith(The Sheriff) was annoying, like beyond annoying. The only tolerable one was Jaime King, who played Kerr Smith's wife. You knew what was coming before every corner turn, or loud bang or the "hello, who's there". The one part about this movie that made the whole theater erupt in laughter is when a girl gets chased completely nude, that was well entertaining. The only reason I saw this is because I really like horror movies, and you should avoid this movie, but if you do see this movie see it in 3D and it may be a little more enjoyable but it was a terrible movie and do not recommend this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't call the film boring. We were lucky enough to get in the 10PM sneak preview which completed a good night. The theater was pretty full and there was not as much noise as I had expected. The film revolves around a maniac dressed in a dark coal mine outfit and mask. Expect to see this as a Halloween costume. Throughout the film, the killer would suddenly appear in the dark outfit and attack a victim. The film is definitely gory.It does follow a plot with a story and in that way is much different from Saw which has no plot or story. The 3d effects are pretty good but not nearly as good as Journey to the Center of the Earth. The main problem with the film is a ridiculous long scene at a motel that seems to go on 15 minutes. This scene is one of the worst in movie history and come across as twisted comedy. It does not fit in with the film. The film is definitely not for kids. To make it worse, the scene is referred to later but it has nothing to do with the story. Eventually, the film becomes a whodunit about who is the maniac in the coal miners suit. The ending could have been better. This is obviously what they used to call a B movie. This means not top directing, acting and producing. It has a lower budget and is called a B movie. Some B movies can be great., but not this one. The idea of a crazed mystery coal miner is pretty good. It was certainly better than Saw and some other films. This film is not boring, at least. But ultimately, the film is not terrible but does not make it because of the gore, motel scene, and ending that could have been better in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the worst movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie starts out OK for the first 5 minutes then it goes all down hill from there. The killer somehow manages to duplicate his body by being the victim and the killer all at the same time. Then out of nowhere they throw some sex scenes and then a fully naked woman decides to go out in the open and just run around naked like an idiot. The whole movie is actually more of a comedy than horror. There's bad acting , a bad script and very little 3D. This movie is really boring and I don't recommend anyone to go to the theatre to see it because it is a waste of money. This movie is like every other predictable low budget slasher. Please people save your money and wait for DVD at least, The 3D isn't worth it especially since there is about 8 parts of 3D that last 2-3 seconds each.PS.VERY PERVERTED AND STUPID ATTEMPT OF A HORROR FLICK</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Throwback to the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine 3-D (2009) *** (out of 4) Remake of the 1981 slasher has a maniac minor killing twenty-two people but ten years later more bodies start to pile up. Is it a copycat killer or has the original come back for more revenge? I'll start off by saying that I'm not a big fan of the original and I'll go even further by saying this one here, story wise, isn't that good. It's more like a two-and-a-half star movie thanks to its throwback to the 80's slashers but the 3-D effects are what really makes it worth seeing. The story has some logical issues to say the least and this includes the identity of the killer, which is pretty impossible considering what you've seen throughout the film. With that said, the movie certainly goes all out in terms of violence and gore. I was pleasantly shocked at how gory this thing was as we get all sorts of graphic killings ranging from picks through the eyes, necks, heads, decapitations and much much more. The red stuff is constantly flowing so I'm sure gore hands are going to be very happy. The film also goes back a few decades in terms of nudity because there's some full frontal female nudity, which we haven't seen in a horror film in a very long time. It seems a lot of slashers today play it safe but that's certainly not the case here. The film goes all out and that includes the 3-D effects. The "Real3D" process is certainly the greatest I've seen and I'm sure others will be very impressed. There are a couple classic scenes with various objects floating at you with one of the best early on when the killer throws his weapon towards the camera. Thankfully the director knew these effects would be the main draw here and he constantly keeps the stuff coming at the screen. Unlike many 3-D movies there's nothing here done for comic relief as the film uses the effects to show off the gore and violence. We get some smaller stuff like one character spitting at the camera but for the most part it's murder and mayhem. The performances are what you'd expect from a film like this but it was great fun seeing Tom Atkins in the cast. Many horror buffs will know him from films like Halloween 3 but it's nice to see him here. In the end, the film certainly doesn't stand out as a classic but you know what to expect when you walk into this. The movie isn't a total success but there are certain things horror and 3-D fans want and this film delivers them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's 'glasses on' for gory fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like so many people these days, I'd rather spend my hard earned cash on a DVD and watch a film in the comfort of my own home than pay a visit to the local multiplex: snacks are cheaper, you can pause the film when nature calls, and if someone starts to rabbit all the way through, you can tell them to be shut up without ending up in a fight (although the wife has been known to get punchy occasionally).But now it seems that the studios have decided to fight back, and they're playing dirty: I mean, who can resist the lure of a horror film on the big screen in 3D? Not me, that's for sure! Which is how I came to find myself coughing up way too much for a 'luxury' seat at the brand new local 9-screener?I guess I'm just a sucker for a silly gimmick (and it seems like I'm not alone, judging by the film's success at the box office)!A remake of an 80s slasher, this gory shocker stars Jensen Ackles as Tom Hanniger, survivor of a Valentine's Day massacre by masked killer Harry Warden. Returning home to the scene of the terrible incident exactly ten years later, Tom?now owner of the town's primary source of revenue, the local mine?intends to put his past behind him by selling the business and leaving town forever. Unfortunately, his plans do not run smoothly: the local mining community is not happy with his decision to sell the mine; Tom's love for old flame Sarah (Jaime King)?now the sheriff's wife? is rekindled; and worst of all, it looks like Harry Warden has returned, pick-axe in hand, to continue his gruesome work.After an introductory montage of news reports that set up a basic back-story for the killer, My Bloody Valentine starts proper with its gory prologue?the wholesale slaughter of a group of teens partying in the Hanniger mine. A tense and extremely bloody scene which showcases the newly developed 3D process to impressive effect, it's a promising start to a film that looks set to be an absolute stonker.The film then moves to the present day, and wastes no time in drenching the screen in even more of the red stuff as a masked maniac?dressed in attire identical to the now-presumed-dead Warden? attacks a couple at a sleazy motel, planting his pick in the bloke's head and chasing the buck naked babe for longer than is really necessary (but who's complaining?), pausing only to pin a dwarf to the ceiling with his pick. Completely bonkers with loads of gratuitous full frontal nudity (hooray for 3D tits and ass!!), this showstopper of a scene is my fave part of the whole film.Unfortunately, as if realising that he wouldn't be able to top that scene if he tried, director Patrick Lussier then opts to calm things down a little to develop the story, and much of the crazy exploitational vibe is ditched in favour of a more suspenseful approach. It's a bad move, and although the film continues to deliver the gore, proceedings become rather dreary and predictable thereon in (a shame... it was all going so well).Lots of extremely repetitive chases and pick-axe killings follow, and by the time the killer's identity is revealed (in a dumb moment that totally 'cheats' the audience, and rivals the end of High Tension for stupidity), there's a good chance that you'll have lost interest.Bereft of its 3D gimmick, I doubt I would rate My Bloody Valentine much higher than a 6, but with the added power of the third dimension, this score rises to an 8. Therefore, I'll average my score out to 7/10 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3-D Bore, Bore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm desperate to see a technology with such promise to get into mainstream movies. Maybe this is the time...even though this isn't the movie. 3-D has been around forever but few directors have embraced a technology that's difficult to work with. (It involves two rolls of film combined together in one camera to give you that effect (which is why it's so fuzzy without the glasses)My Bloody valentine sadly feels like an old pair of jeans that should have been tossed out long ago. The slasher film was such the rage so many years ago with some inventiveness such as "Halloween" and "Nightmare On Elm Street". My Bloody Valentine lacks such inventiveness. It's too bad because the 3-D technology has never looked better. Unlike most films, this baby gives everything in 3-D. Every scene, every title and even the closing credits spare no expense. Therefore, you really feel you're in every scene and you see what an extra dimension (z in addition to x and y for those math nerds) really does for a film.It's just too bad the plot doesn't offer up the entertainment value. It's bad...really bad with an ineffective cast and mundane material. It's obvious because there are a lot of slasher scenes in this mix that are almost laughable in their horrid attempts to scare you. I could predict with ease what each scene was going to do and what was the outcome and how they were going to die. Added to that the actors are scripted to put "kill me" on their bare chested bodies from walking into traps to crying out for the death kill through obtuse and laughable survival skills. Cops walk into rooms without backup. Girls run into danger traps instead of out of them when danger comes and let's not forget the inevitable loud whimpering less our dumb killer misses its prey. That and the rubber gas mask bit with a construction axe for a scary look augmented with Dark Vader over-the-top breathing and you've got a great spoof on your hands -- but they all seem to take this a little too seriously. Hey, it's a paycheck. So is it worth seeing? I suggest see it ONLY in 3-D and see it with a cheap seat and low, really low expectations.</fullReview>

I remember loving the original, bad acting and all. With this lousy 'not really a remake', it's impossible to care about the characters, you can barely decipher the plot, and the horror rhythm is completely off (except for about 10 minutes of the film). It's impossible that these glaring errors weren't obvious in the script, if there was one.

		<shortDescription>One-dimensional mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 3D horror movie; let's be honest, it's hard to think of a genre of film that ostensibly cries out for critics to get out their list of reasons why both mostly always fall flat on their face. By now, the very idea of such a film is sure to evoke predisposed contempt or a sardonic quip from those subjected to reel after reel of mundane horror year after year. Sometimes, and it's a very rare occurrence, but sometimes such movies surprise. My Bloody Valentine 3D, a remake of a bad slasher flick from the eighties blown up in three dimensions, is no exception to this general rule of thumb. Yet it's not necessarily the extra dimension that is to blame this time; no, the 3D isn't as distracting as it usually renders itself, instead offering brief glimpses of entertainment inside a shallow and mostly flat story. Coming from a director associated with such cinematic landmarks as The Eye and White Noise 2, My Bloody Valentine 3D isn't likely to get many people's hopes up beforehand and it unfortunately does very little to remove the stigma of the cliché-driven horror movie during its painfully slow run.The story of My Bloody Valentine proceeds just like countless other slasher flicks from the eighties and beyond; teenagers stumble upon a serial killer madman, some die, some survive to live with the scars. Set around ten years after this opening sequence, the movie then moves on to deliver another mystery story with no real mystery centred around a second coming of murders. So what does all this have to do with Valentines Day? Not much. A good majority of the script is spent detailing suspects getting slowly wacked off the list through a pick-axe to some part of the body, resulting in 3D chunks ?of course- flying at your face. It can be fun to watch at first, sure, but there's no tension, suspense or horror to keep things moving; it's just a circus act with substance substituted with cheap "jump" moments. The inclusion of the Valentines theme seems like an arbitrary marketing scheme at best.Characters, despite their rendering are flat and relegated to playing out tired cliché motives and roles with mundane dialogue straight from the pits of horror movie hell. This, in tow with an abundant heap of contrived action sequences, ho-hum domestic drama and a cheap and predictable conclusion form what is essentially the backbone to an irredeemably flawed film that only briefly offers moments to enjoy; the rest is just tiresome formula.Aesthetically the movie is somewhat impressive. In direct contrast to a similar feature I seen only a few months prior, My Bloody Valentine looks quite good; that is, it uses the extra dimension of photography for some interesting effects. Sure enough there are moments when the use of such becomes overly kitschy, but it's hard not to be impressed by all this lifelike rendering when everything else is so flat. Goreheads should also be satisfied with the film's commitment to delivering extremely graphic images; My Bloody Valentine doesn't deceive with its title. The performances remain a testament as to why photography should always be considered after casting however. With the exception of leading man Kerr Smith, My Bloody Valentine is a cesspool of laughably bad acting; I suppose you could applaud them for recapturing the essence of eighties horror, but then you'd have to start giving out directorial awards to Roger Corman. Smith isn't Oscar-nominee material, sure, but his performance remains a ray of light within such a murky production.In the end however, there really is no way to recommend a viewing of My Bloody Valentine, especially if your cinema isn't offering the 3D experience. If anything the movie serves as a reminder that the extra dimension is a mostly superfluous addition to bad movies more often than not sent straight to DVD shelves. In turn the only reactions such fare is likely to garner are tiresome groans of audiences around the world as they are treated to the same old stupidity, only this time blown up with an already lauded gimmick. Those looking for anything remotely compelling or thrilling best look else where; no amount of extra-dimensional padding can save My Bloody Valentine from the shallow, one-dimensional mess that calls itself a screenplay.- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first 3D film i seen was Beowolf which i thought was great and used the 3D gimmick very well.So i thought i'd give this a chance (Even tough all my common sense was telling me not too) Basically without the 3D its the one of the worst films ever.With the 3D its just a very bad film.They cram in the 3D without any thought and it just comes across pointless. The acting is poor and you don't care about any of the characters. Add to this mess every slasher cliché you can think off and you have bloody valentine 3D.It seems like the people who wrote this movie were more interested in showing how many different ways you can murder someone with a pick axe then actually making a decent film.I cant comment on the ending because one scene was that bad i walked out (First film in my life i've ever walked out of).Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Bloody Valentine is set in the small mining town of Harmony &amp; starts as we learn that a tragedy has struck, in an explosion several miners have been killed with the comatose Harry Warden (Richard John Walters) the only survivor. However it later comes to light that Harry killed the miners himself to conserve the rapidly running out air, it's valentines day &amp; Harry wakes from his coma &amp; goes on a killing spree murdering over twenty people but is finally shot dead by Sheriff Burke (Tom Atkins) &amp; buried under a cave-in. Jump forward ten years later &amp; Harmony is still trying to forget the terrible events that haunt the town, as valentines day approaches the murders start again as someone dressed in mining gear wielding a pick-axe is brutally killing local residents connected with the mine. It's up to Sheriff Axel Palmer (Kerr Smith) to find the killer &amp; lay a dark past to rest once &amp; for all...Also known under the title My Bloody Valentine 3D this was directed by Patrick Lussier &amp; is a fairly faithful remake of the early 80's Canadian slasher flick My Bloody Valentine (1981), well when I say faithful a lot of the main imagery &amp; ideas from the original are present &amp; correct like the killer in gas mask &amp; mining gear, the pick-axe killings, the teen slasher feel, a clueless Sheriff, the small mining town setting &amp; ripped out human hearts in heart shaped valentine boxes. While this remake is a little more polished I can't really say it's a huge improvement or any worse for that matter, the murder mystery angle is played up a little more in this remake although it's not very sophisticated &amp; does tend to slow the pace down at times. When finally revealed the killers motives &amp; reasons are a little silly &amp; improbable to say the least, the final revelation just isn't that satisfying &amp; bits of the puzzle don't quite fall into place as neatly as they should. One area where this 2009 remake scores points over the original 1981 effort is in the gore department, with much more outlandish &amp; memorable gore scenes than the heavily cut for an 'R' rating original although it has since been re-released with some of that cut gore put back in. The character's are alright, the dialogue is alright &amp; it's enjoyable enough I suppose without being particularly original but that ending just didn't quite work for me.When originally released the main gimmick with My Bloody Valentine was that it was in 3D using the Real D technology that a spate of other recent big blockbuster films like Beowulf (2007), Bolt (2008), Journey to the Center of the Earth (2008), Coraline (2009), Monsters vs Aliens (2009) &amp; the forthcoming horror remake Piranha 3-D (2010) have so it looks like there's a market for it. The process uses those cheap glasses you wear &amp; objects appear to jump out of the screen at you which is quite nice for novelty value but it's not used for much more here than pick-axes being flung at us &amp; a few amusing gore effects like eyeballs on spikes &amp; someones getting their jawbone ripped off &amp; flung towards the audience. There's some great gore here, heads cut in half, a burned off face, people impaled on pick-axes, pick-axes shoved through peoples heads &amp; jaws, lots of ripped out hearts, plenty of gory mutilated dead bodies, one ripped in half &amp; it definitely delivers on the gore which is nice. There's also a really trashy sequence in which a naked blonde babe runs all over the place confronting her boyfriend &amp; then trying to escape the killer while completely nude &amp; director Lussier never misses the change to show off her rather fine body &amp; breasts.With a supposed budget of about $15,000,000 this did pretty well at the box-office making a tidy 50 odd million, while the original had a bleak realistic look to it this Hollywood remake feels a little flat &amp; too clean by comparison. Filmed in Pennsylvania to take advantage of various financial incentives. The acting is fine although the teen cast were probably chosen for their good looks rather than their ability &amp; it's nice to see veteran Tom Atkins who is no stranger to the horror genre.My Bloody Valentine on it's own is a good solid gory horror thriller teen slasher which when you add the sometimes amusing 3D aspect of it I think it's well worth a watch. The only real downer is the ending which didn't work for me &amp; one or two slightly slow moments &amp; while it's no worse it's not really any better then the early 80's original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Super-Bloody-De-Luxe Slasher Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy, did this movie ever have to stand up against a whole lot of prejudices before it even properly got released into theaters! First of all it's a remake of an 80's slasher movie and, generally speaking these don't receive a very warm welcome from the horror-loving community. With good reason, by the way, if you remember crappy remakes like "Prom Night", "When a Stranger Calls" and "Black Christmas". Secondly it's a remake of an original that was never highly regarded at in the first place. The original "My Bloody Valentine", released in 1981 and directed by George Mihalka, was a rather mundane and unspectacular follower of John Carpenter's "Halloween" in the Holiday-Horror cycle that almost never receives a mentioning when people list their favorite flicks of the 80's decade. And then finally this new movie is directed by Patrick Lussier, who up until now only has his name linked to inferior horror junk like "Dracula 2000" and "White Noise 2". Many people, including yours truly, where therefore pleasantly surprised to see that "My Bloody Valentine 3D" turned out a hugely entertaining and gore-soaked slasher highlight of its generation. This is a totally unpretentious and incredibly fast-paced "Hack 'em Up" movie with stupendous 3D effects and a dazzling body count. The plot is intentionally kept simple and straightforward, though a few ambitious twists and effective red herring occur when approaching the climax, in order to treat the bloodhounds among us to even more engrossing massacres, gratuitous bits of sleaze and delightful throwbacks to typically 80's genre clichés. Set in the cozy and picturesque little mining town of Harmony, the story opens with the bloody ? and I do mean BLOODY ? rampage of a miner named Harry Warden. He got hospitalized after a dreadful mining accident caused by the boss' young and inexperienced son Tom Hanniger, but exactly one year later he escapes and kills half of the hospital staff before returning home and literally crash into a Valentine's party. Tom Hanniger and a few of his friends his friends are the only ones left alive when Sheriff Burke (Tom Atkins ? Woo Hoo!) finally puts an end to Harry Warden's bloodbath. Ten years later Tom Hanniger returns to Harmony with the sole intent to sell his father's mine, but he learns that many things have changed since the tragedy he more or less caused a decade earlier. His high school sweetheart is married to the new sheriff and cheats on her and the elderly population hates Tom for his plans to sell the mine. When the vicious killer dressed in mining outfit and swinging around a pickaxe returns as well, Tom is the prime suspect as well. Is he really guilty or did Harry Warden return from the dead? "My Bloody Valentine" is a guaranteed horror crowd-pleaser with enough ingredients to satisfy the more experienced and skeptical "older" genre fans as well as young and over-enthusiast gore geeks. The special effects are stupendous, with pickaxes and severed human heads flying directly towards the audience, and marvelously over-the-top sanguinary! There isn't too much atmosphere or suspense, as the emphasis mainly lies on excitement, but the few sequences inside the mines nevertheless evoke some feeling of claustrophobia and fright. The attempt to insert an unexpected twist at the end is admirable. Adequate acting performances from all the young cast members and it was really fantastic to finally see Tom Atkins ("Maniac Cop", "Night of the Creeps", "The Fog"?) star is a worthwhile horror movie role again! Great, mindless splatter amusement.</fullReview>
