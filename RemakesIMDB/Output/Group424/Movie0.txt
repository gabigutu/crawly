		<shortDescription>A Proper Remake. It Sparkled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin reviewing the movie, I just want to say first that if you haven't seen the original or didn't even know that there was an original, you might not enjoy this movie as much as someone who respects it's classic status in black cinema. I actually thought that this movie was going to be terrible. I kept telling my roommate and best friend that I'm not excited and might just watch it on bootleg and if I do go to see it it will only be for the late and legendary Whitney Houston. But thankfully I was invited on a date, so I was relieved that I didn't have to pay for this terrible, terrible film. But to my surprise, I enjoyed it from beginning to end.As an upcoming writer and film school graduate, there are things about this film that I can truly appreciate more than the average movie goer, like the costumes, the set design, the hair, the locations, and most definitely the script. It was solid. For this to be Mara Brock Akil and her husband's very first feature film together, the script was very well written. It had a lot of memorable one liners and great comebacks. Also, the writer put a few spins on the story that worked very well as an adaption.Jordin Sparks did very well as Sparkle. I don't think the character was a stretch for her because she's sweet and shy in real life but for this to be her first film she did great. Mike Epps as Satin was a surprise to me. He's usually the smart mouthed side kick in stereotypical black films but his personality played well with his character. Derek Luke was solid and Tika Sumpter was awesome. In the original, Sumpter's character didn't really have much of a story but I appreciated the fact that the writer's gave her a backstory. Whitney Houston did phenomenal as the mother. Her vibrant personality is totally opposite of the film's character who was depressed, unhappy and sort of narrow minded. But the star of the evening was definitely Carmen Ejogo as Sparkle's older and sexy sister, Sister. She stole the show. I had never heard of her until this movie but she was awesome. While the acting wasn't Oscar worthy everybody did a solid job.The original definitely had its flaws. There were holes in the story and unanswered question but I feel as all movies back in the day were still finding their proper structure. But this adaption definitely left me satisfied. There was more character development, more backstory and since the the movie is about family the bond between all three sisters s what made me love this movie even more. You can tell that they all loved each other and would had each other's backs no matter what.I'm happy that the original music was in this film along with new ones. The vocals were good but of course Whitney Houston dominated in that department being that she is one of the greatest voices to ever walk this Earth.Overall, Sparkle was a solid movie. Very enjoyable family film. I have a feeling that a lot of people are gonna love this movie, a lot of people are think it's okay and a lot of people are going to hate it. But these types of movies aren't meant for everyone's enjoyment, only those who understand and appreciate this type of story. I recommend it for all who know the original, all who love good music and all who love Whitney.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Miss This Movie - It Has Everything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great, fun, enjoyable movie. It has everything: great lines and killer comebacks, wit, excitement, suspense, drama, charged emotions, great acting, a good story, beautiful cinematography, and of course, the music rocks. It is way, way, way better than the original. let me say that again in caps: IT IS WAY, WAY, WAY BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. I was actually surprised it was so good, given the reviews. I really did not want the movie to end. Afterwards, I found myself wondering what the sisters would be doing 3 years later, and it's been a long, long time since I've cared enough about any movie character to think about them even 5 minutes after the movie. Sparkle delivers on every level: script, cinematography, realism, acting, and singing.On the acting front, Whitney Houston delivered a powerful, raw and completely revealing performance. She was Emma. Her figure, bearing, and presence are completely transformed from "legend," "Whitney Houston," to a bruised and weary woman who is determined that her babies will not lose their way as she did, and who is fighting with every ounce of her being for their futures. When you know how funny and filled with energy Houston could be, then you see her as this world-weary mother, fighting for her kids, you see how great an acting job she does. She fills the role completely. Her song, His Eye Is On The Sparrow, is the showstopper and anchors the movie perfectly. I cannot think of any singing/song scene in any movie that comes close to what Houston does here. This performance alone is more than worth the price of admission.Mike Epps is another standout as Satin: he delivers a memorable, slick, cool, and lethal performance. All of the sisters are excellent! Tika Sumpter was really great, as was Carmen Ejogo, and though Jordin Sparks' character is the quiet sister, she works the role and is believable. There are no weak performances on the screen. And, it goes without saying that the music works perfectly. The three sisters are really smokin' hot on the stage, with Carmen Ejogo oozing sensuous sex-appeal.Yes, this is a remake, and yes, its a popular theme, but just like fairy-tales that we enjoy listening to and telling over an over, you want to hear this story retold because it is so well done. There are strong male rolls, and lots of testosterone-driven tensions, and, of course, strong female roles. So, this movie works as a good date night movie, a good movie to see with friends, and as a good movie to see on your own.This is not The Godfather and it's not Shakespeare, but it is a well done, enjoyable, emotionally satisfying movie. I highly recommend it. Thumbs way up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sparkle but no Shine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was not hyped about new "Sparkle" and didn't really want to see but we did this am. Glad we only paid $6.00, not worth much more. Film wasn't able to capture original's essence; the important cautionary tale of stardom. Houston purchased rights to script in late 90s and was going to make it a Aaliyah vehicle. This would have worked perfectly as Aaliyah had a strong acting talent; Jordin Sparks can't act nor does she have any 'star quality', certainly not enough to carry this film. Film was in preproduction when Aaliyah died so it was placed on hold.Main problem is the writing. In trying to update script, writers mover location from Harlem to Detroit and time from late 50s to 1968. Fine; writing however was lacking big-time. I think they wanted to capture "Sparkle" with a touch of "The Five Heartbeats" and they failed. Dialog was dry, boring, and over done. Not surprising as the production team is the creators of The Game. "Sparkle"/"Five Heartbeats" made you care about the characters, not here. Add to bad writing, bad editing; it was more like a music video and you never felt like it was 1968 since all the costumes weren't authentic and looked like they were merely retro copies. The camera angles used were so slick that it came off as overdone. I think they forgot that in 1968 we weren't wireless. We needed Mic's, amps, and full bands, not synthesizers and computers. Most of the performances were displayed without any equipment. I guess film makers don't understand less is more. They also tweaked the most important and crucial element of the story (ie Sister's OD) which completely made the ending unbelievable and you felt like the lesson of the story was lost and never learned. It was strange watching one other thing about the film; the removal of it's black culture. The writers mention the race riots 2x in film but depict Detroit as being beautifully multicultural. All scenes have a nice balance of multi-ethnicities intermixing and socializing w/each other. It was like watching the Houston "Cinderella". The mixed cultures used there was intentional to remove the idea of race, but here it sticks out especially since one of the original story lines was about the civil rights movement. The writers only touched on this briefly and simultaneously on the dysfunctional family element during one scene. It was very sad to see and completely unrealistic of the time period.Next of course is casting. I love artists who are 'triple' threats but they must be masters in all the elements of entertainment. I'm not a big fan of hiring singers to act and this film displays why. Sparks was exceptionally weak as Sparkle. First and foremost this is a black story about a black family. Like Carra and McKee, Sparks is mixed but where the aforementioned women are decidedly "women of color" (culturally) , Sparks is obviously more "white". I am not referring to her appearance but to her manner. Anyone who knows Lonette McKee knows exactly what I am talking about. Sparks tone of speech, delivery of lines, and lack of a natural rhythm stuck out b/c of this difference. Surprisingly Houston actually delivered the strongest of the women. God rest her soul, Houston wasn't always thought the best actress but she came out well here. Her acting was it's strongest since "Bodyguard" maybe b/c was telling her own story about the trappings of success. It's very obvious the production was expanded to showcase her scenes a/f her death. Her only song is in it's entirely w/o any edits. Supporting cast (the men) is stronger which helps the ladies but since the writing isn't there, it's all for moot.Music- Where to begin? R. Kelly, sorry you are not Curtis Mayfield. Film is set in Motown 68, music shouldn't like 2012. Closing tracks, "One Wing" and "Love Will" sound way too much like today. Kelly needs some more throwback if he's really going to take this to Broadway. His arrangement of "Something He Can Feel" was nothing more than an EnVogue cover. I was left wondering if he's heard Aretha's original masterpiece.All I can say don't go expecting have the same sentimental feeling for the original, you won't. I was hoping this would be so good that I wouldn't compare it to the original. Instead, I sat through this film wishing I were home watching my DVD of the original. Ulimately this film focuses too much on appearance and not enough on substance, much like our society today. It lacks the serious heart and empathy of it's predecessor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about this movie besides the fact that it was the best that I have seen in a long time. Along with everyone else in my theater we all enjoyed the movie!Everyone did a fantastic job but the real screen stealers are Jordan,Tika, Mike, and of course Whitney! The only reason I seen this movie at first was for Whitney but after watching it I fell in love with it.You will be surprised in some scenes, some might make you want to cry, cheer the characters on , and the singing OMG is awesome. The movie might feel like it is starting off slow for some but after a few minutes the atmosphere changes and it's really enjoyable. It's just a great movie and Whitney definitely Sparkles in her last film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sparkles like a polished...well, you know...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pop star Jordin Sparks stars alongside Whitney Houston (in her final performance of what was supposed to be the second wind of her acting career) in Sparkle, a remake of the 1976 cult hit among black audiences. Conversely, the 2012 version, centred around a trio of sisters who hit the big time in 1960s Motown before being crippled by the lures of fame, is entirely devoid of any personality or soul, playing out like every other African-American themed shambles this side of Tyler Perry's repeated disasters.Director Salim Akil (an apparent prodigy of Perry's stylings) breaths plastic life into the cardboard cut-outs he calls characters. Almost every stereotype conceivable in the dram-rom genre is on full display, including the preachy reverend, the tough girl, the abusive husband, the heavy-handed mother and her introverted daughter. The performances across the board are sound, but a practically non-existent screenplay renders any interaction between characters essentially worthless. Even at a touch under two hours, Sparkle severely overstays its welcome. Given the similar plot frame and emphasis on glitz-and-glamour music, comparisons to Aussie crowd-pleaser The Sapphires are to be expected, but where the local production made its intentions clear from the outset, Sparkle rambles and labours, pleading with its audiences to maintain an unwarranted sliver of attention in the lead up to a drab and bitterly predictable conclusion. *There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sparkle Sparkles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that I liked this version of Sparkle better than the original and I am definitely glad that they changed the story up a bit. This film is very predictable, but I did not care. I think that the cast that was assembled for this film did an excellent job. I have to admit that my main reason for going to see this film was because I wanted to see Whitney Houston in her swan song performance. Whitney (Emma) did an outstanding job in this film and I have to admit that when she sang I got a little (okay, a lot) choked up. Not just because she was singing but because I realized how much I missed her. Jordan Sparks (Sparkle) was made for this role. With this being her film debut, I am sure that we will be seeing a lot more of Jordan on screen. Carmen Ejogo (Sister) almost stole the show along with Mike Epps (Satin). Both were captivating and although you knew from the start where this relationship was heading, it did not matter because you wanted to see it play out. When Michael Beach (Rev. Bryce) hit the screen, I was looking at him and I knew that I had seen him on screen before, but I just could not place him. Whoever did his make-up did a darn good job. Tika Sumpter (Dolores) has come a long way since her days on the television soap One Life to Live. She is the "grounded" sister of the bunch and demonstrates that by having clear goals set and a strong sense of self. Derek Luke (Stix) is the group's manager and Sparkle's love interest who is just trying to do the right thing. I do have to say that there were some faux pas in the film. There were times that the group was singing without mikes and the half-naked dress would have never been acceptable during that time (I don't think). By the way, there was a women sitting in my row that was singing along with all the songs that she remembered (I was cracking up). Do I think that this will be the film of the year? No, but I do think that Director Salim Akil did a good enough job to warrant the price of a ticket. One last thing, I also got choked up again when Jordan sang at the conclusion of the film. I will be downloading that one. I give this film green light.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I get skeptic on watching movies that revolve around singing groups in the 50s-80s because I feel like they are all the same. However, I absolutely enjoyed and would love to see this movie again. Let me just say Carmen Ejogo is an absolutely AMAZING actress. She practically had me in tears throughout the whole movie because she betrayed her character so well! Im not familiar with Carmens work but she sold it. Shes stunningly beautiful, and I cant wait to see her in other upcoming films. Jordan Sparks off course is an amazing singer, and for being her first film she did a good job. I think with time shell be better actress. I think this movie was a great last goodbye for Whitney Houston. Im glad I was able to hear her sing one last time. (: This is definitely a must see, and I will for surely be recommending this movie to everyone I see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Houston's Swan Song Overshadowed by Ejogo's Star-Making Turn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's an indisputable star of this synthetically watchable 2012 melodrama, and it's neither the late Whitney Houston in her last role nor Season 6 "American Idol" winner Jordin Sparks. It's relatively unknown British actress Carmen Ejogo (Maya Rudolph's sister in "Away We Go") who explodes off the screen in the meaty, scene-stealing role of Sister, the hell-raising eldest of a trio of daughters to Emma Anderson, an uptight, church-going woman who raised them on her own. Emma is Houston's supporting role, and while she proves she had the makings of a solid character actress, there is an unfortunate shroud of irony in her presence given her own tragic, tabloid-saturated life was itself a cautionary tale about the lure of drugs in show business. This time in the part Lonette McKee played superbly in the 1976 original, Ejogo inhabits the character living out the nightmare of drug addiction and spousal abuse.The rest of the movie is mostly by the numbers. It opens in 1968, a decade later than the original movie's story, with Sister and her little sister Sparkle sneaking out to a nightclub headlined by a period- costumed Cee Lo Green in a cameo appearance. Sister vamps her way through an original song by Sparkle, which attracts the attention of an aspiring record producer named Stix. He encourages them to shoot for the big time, so they convince level-headed sister Dee to make it a trio decked out sequins, wigs and false eyelashes in order to become the next Supremes. What struck me is how eerily the three women look like the original Supremes line-up with Sparks resembling Florence Ballard and Ejogo looking like a sultry cross between Diana Ross and Beyoncé. Of course, their newfound success comes with heartache, as Sister takes up with a smooth albeit vicious stand-up comic named Satin, and Sparkle struggles between family devotion and her burgeoning love for Stix.Naturally Emma is constantly worried that her girls will repeat the same mistakes she made when she tried to make it as a singer only to be spit out by the music industry. That means Houston spends most of her limited screen time either fretting about her family or being self-righteous about her religious convictions. The dinner table scene between her and Ejogo is the movie's best scene laying bare the deep-seeded resentment Sister has for her mother and providing a flash of grief over a line that reminds you how Houston died. The melodrama is laid on pretty thick, especially during Sister's downward spiral, but director Salim Akil ("Jumping the Broom") and his wife, screenwriter Mara Brock Akil, balance it with just enough lighter moments. The songs, of course, are what matters the most, and smartly, Curtis Mayfield's original compositions have been retained with the standouts being "Hooked on Your Love", "Look into Your Heart" and especially "Something He Can Feel" which Ejogo performs with sultry conviction.The new songs by R. Kelly are not nearly as memorable since they sound too contemporary for the period. Sadly, Houston sings only once in character, the spiritual stand-by, "His Eye Is on the Sparrow", and limited to her lower register, her coarsened voice, while emotionally impactful, is vocally a mere shadow of her once-beautiful pipes. Sparks gets to sing a lot more with a predictably booming voice, and she delivers an unaffected turn in the title role. Mike Epps gives a strong performance as Satin, and his scenes with Ejogo echo similarly volatile scenes in "What's Love Got to Do with It?" As Stix, Derek Luke does much better work than Philip-Michael Thomas in the original. Tika Sumpter provides some memorably defiant moments as Dee, the one sister who could take or leave the music. The movie runs too long at 116 minutes, but between Houston's death and Ejogo's star-making turn, it takes on a greater depth than the musical nostalgic trip it was originally designed to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sparkle Shines but with Less Pain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a HUGE fan of the original "Sparkle" from my childhood, it took some getting used to all the changes that were made to the new version, but somehow it worked. Mara Brock Akil is a talented Hollywood Showrunner and I've been a longtime fan of hers.Whitney Houston played her part well as the over protective, bible toting, stern, and bitter single mom of three young women with a troublesome past of her own, who eventually comes around to showing support for her daughter Sparkle's dream of achieving secular music stardom.The ads portray Cee-Lo Green as if he is a main character, but he simply has a short cameo role. Carmen Ejogo plays the part of "Sister" with a little less UMPH and sassiness than the original, vivacious Lonette McKee, but I loved the fact that Akil was able to give us a little more depth to most of the characters, especially Mike Epps as "Satin." He did an outstanding job, although he played the part of a famous comedian (go-figure), as opposed to a drug dealer like the original. Nonetheless, the guy has acting chops for sure! The oh so gorgeous Jordin Sparks and talented Derek Luke played the roles of Sparkle and Stix wonderfully.What I would have liked to see was a bit more of the Levi/ Sister relationship before Satin wooed her away, as in the original film. The breathtaking Tika Sumpter played the part of Delores to a Tee, and there was a stronger bond of sisterhood the remake was able to explore.There are just some unforgettable highlights in the original story that needed to stay, like the Stix &amp; Satin alley fight, Levi working his way up the hustlers food chain. In the new film, he's on the bottom, and the next thing we know he's on top and giving Satin a dose of his own medicine, but we never learn how he got there. There was brutality with Satin and Sister, but the original "crawl" scene would have worked just as well in the remake. Also, there's never any discord between Sparkle and Stix. He says he's leaving, but never does, and she just takes him back with open arms. Delores desire to leave and become a doctor came from watching her mother struggle as a maid her entire life, but in the new film, they came from a middle class family, so there was no struggle.Overall, it was a good movie that worked with all the changes, but if I had my wish, I would have wanted to see just a little bit more PAIN and STRUGGLE that sparked the original "Sparkle."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent but The Original Was Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sparkle (2012)** 1/2 (out of 4)Remake of the 1976 film about sisters Sparkle (Jordin Sparks), Sister (Carmen Ejogo) and Dolores (Tika Sumpter) who decide to try and make it in the music business even though their mother (Whitney Houston) objects to them doing so after her life was ruined by an attempt. The original movie was quite predictable but it was still very much worth watching because of the performances and the music. I'm really not sure why we needed a remake and especially since this one here takes place in the 1960s just like the previous ones. Either way, for the most part this is a mildly entertaining film but there's still no question that it falls short of the original. There are actually quite a few things that do work here including the performances but especially Ejogo as the troubled sister whose decisions are going to cost her and her sisters. I thought she was incredibly believable throughout the picture no matter what the story was calling for. It could be for sexiness in the music or the downfall of the drug addiction. This here was actually the first time I had seen Sparks in anything and I thought she was fine in the role, although, like the original, her character is pretty much in the background. As for Houston, she's not too bad in the film but I must admit that I think her death somewhat hurt the movie, which is strange to say because I doubt anyone would have gone to this had it not been her final film. Hearing her character talk about drug abuse, bad choices and other things just makes you think of Houston and her death. This really has a negative impact on the film that it might not have had if the actress didn't die during the post-production. Derek Luke, Mike Epps and Curtis Armstrong are all extremely good in their parts. Another negative thing is that the majority of the music is pretty forgettable with none of the songs really jumping out at you. This includes Houston's one number, which is just pretty weak. Still, SPARKLE manages to have enough in it to make it worth sitting through even if the end result isn't nearly as good as most would have hoped for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sparkle is a low rent version of Dreamgirls so to speak a remake of an unremarkable film form the 70s is a bad film make no mistake about it. The direction is very amateur, the cinematography is crap and the performances are mostly questionable but the film has its charms as well as it's good moments. And although the film is way melodramatic and unintentionally funny at parts it still manages to be entertaining and consistently engaging. The film centers on a trio of sisters in a band called well "Sisters" lol. The plotting movers along expectedly as they have a minor rise to fame while dealing with their overprotective mother, love, drugs, sex and domestic abuse. But the film also delves a little deeper into the intricate relationships between them due most to the solid performance from Carmen Ejogo as Sister she's sultry and seemingly self centered but underneath that she's extremely protective of her sisters she basically raised as her mother had problems. Because of that her position in the group and her family is a difficult, multi layered one and the best exploration is done there. Everything else feels a little forced and flimsy. I don't wanna be to hard on the film because for the most part I enjoyed it and maybe thats because I enjoy lifetime movies. It has it's good moments and it's bad and the best I can say about Whitney Houston's involvement in the film is that she was a very talented woman earlier on in her career and I hope she's at peace now. Although a mixed bag there is enough here to merit a recommendation if this type of melodramatic, musical period piece appeals to you. I'd also like to say that even though the film is set in the past it never feels that way. The consistency is off as well as the logic and it feels very modern with some retro costumes. The film doesn't much sparkle as have a dull shine. 3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whitney Houston's best performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not expect to like this movie, but I really loved it. The original movie was a favorite of mine, but the rewrites really made the story more realistic. Not all black families lived in the ghetto in the sixties and most black men were not and are not drug dealers.Satin was a more believable character as a jealous comedian. Even the domestic violence portrayed the real issue behind the violence, insecurity, not sadism as the first movie implied and it showed how women get caught up in love and belonging, not the money. Whitney Houston's character was defined in this movie and the church setting provided an opportunity for Whitney to do her thing.The original movie was made during the period of blaxploitation, and without the caricatures, it is doubtful that the movie would have been made. At that time black people were simply happy to see someone who looked like them on the big screen. There were actual human beings in the remake and I think I even liked the songs better.Don't believe the critics. This was really a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm one of those people who are hard on remakes, especially if I enjoyed the original. I'm being very kind in giving this movie a 2. It was quite terrible.This is a remake that really isn't a remake, it just steals things from the original and throws them into a new film loosely based on Sparkle. I actually wish they had done a true remake, because at least the script would have been good if nothing else.Nobody can play Sister the way Lonette McKee can; she owns the role, and her performance can not be duplicated nor even closely matched. Lonette was about 22 when she played Sister, Carmen Ejogo is about 38; she is just too old to play Sister! Lonette managed to be alluring and charismatic as Sister without being trashy. It felt like Carmen was trying too hard to act like a sexy naughty girl, and Lonette simply oozed that type of aura. She had one of the most gorgeous faces and figures that I have ever seen in the 1976 Sparkle; Carmen doesn't have that. Also, Lonette's speaking voice and cadence really added a layer to the role that was missing from this version.I first saw the original in about 1996, I was maybe 15 or 16, and have been hooked ever since. I'm biased, but I can still say that even if I had not seen the original; I would not like the semi-remake.The acting is awful. Jordin Sparks can't act. Irene Cara's Sparkle seemed so naturally sweet, and Jordin's Sparkle just came off as phony; like acting.How on earth do you go from Philip Michael Thomas as Stix to Derek Luke? The same can be said for Satin and Levi, how do you go from Tony King to Mike Epps, and from Dorian Harewood to Omari Hardwick? The biggest difference between the films is that the remake has no gut, no core, no soul. Where is the heartbreaking drama? Where is the power?A 1976 film about the music industry is bound to be better than a modern one. There are some subjects that just don't pan out very well in more modern times, such as the music industry and the modeling industry.There was a time when movies about The Temptations or The Ronettes would be a surefire hit, but that time has passed. These types of movies tend to come off as phony nowadays. That's not saying a good one can't be made, but it apparently is a very hard thing to pull off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As of right now sparkle is my all time number one favorite movie. Sparkle has everything. It has great acting, great script and of course music. The actress who played as "sister" - I am so adding it to my list of best performances by a woman. What sister went through as a singer, daughter, wife and person was 100 percent inspiring. i also thought Sparkle had a very good ending. I think it was definitely a better then the ending from the original. Lastly i will say that it's very rare when remakes turn out to be perfect. Sparkle is one of those rare remakes. It is perfect for anyone who loves music, drama, great acting, a good cry and of course a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>need better songs for a movie about singing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main problem with this movie is that there weren't any great songs. All the songs were just so-so, nothing stood out. If your movie is about someone making it in the music business, then there needs to be a great song. Besides that nothing was great about any of the characters nor the acting. Jordan Sparks isn't much of an actress. Everything was so cliché in this. Youngest sister has the most talent but is to scared to be the lead. Oldest sister is the lead but hooks up with the wrong guy and begins using drugs and being abused. Then there is the mom who tried to be a star herself, but succumbed to the evils of show business. Just so done before.FINAL VERDICT: Skip it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pleasant Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film because my wife put it in the queue. My thought was - oh well - another chick flick - with singing - this is going to hurt. And yes - it was a chick flick with singing - but I enjoyed this one. The stage performances by the character Sister probably helped - but I also thought the film was generally well done. Considering her age and experience - Jordin Sparks did a fantastic job. Her performance at the end was masterful. So I was surprised (again) when I came onto IMDb to see some details and saw that it was rated a lowly 4.9. After reading a few reviews I noticed that many of the people giving lower ratings were comparing this film with an earlier version. That almost always results in a low opinion of the later version. I am an "old white guy" so I did not see the earlier version. I thought this was good. I gave it a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The late Whitney Houston did a fine farewell turn in Sparkle and star Jordin Sparks wasn't so bad, either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last February 12, I reviewed the original Sparkle that starred Irene Cara in the title role and in which I noted Whitney Houston's death the previous day because of her role in the remake which I'm reviewing now. Ms. Houston, who was also one of the exec producers, is very good as the mother of the three daughters who initially form a girl group of singers even though I noticed that her speaking voice was now quite worn from her years of drugs. But her singing her one song here was still great so she left this viewer still wanting more from her though I know we'll just have her recordings and movie and TV appearances to look for now but that should be good enough considering how much she contributed to the entertainment world. Now about this remake: With some changes in story and characterization, not to mention period and location, it's still about one young woman's dream of writing and singing good hit songs despite her mother's initial disapproval. And "American Idol" winner Jordin Sparks turns out to be somewhat of a good actress to make the character of Sparkle shine though of course it's really her singing those now-classic Curtis Mayfield songs from the original movie that really puts her through. The most impressive turns are those who play her two sisters especially the one who eventually ends up going to medical school (Tika Sumpter) whenever she confronts her other drug addled sister (Carmen Ejogo) about her abuse at the hands of her comedian husband. As for which version is better, I say this one though it seemed to lose some dramatic edge near the end compared to the original one. Still, the longer length did help open up the story and characterizations enough that I was mostly satisfied so on that note, I highly recommend this version of Sparkle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sparkle..??? Not!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The worse thing about this movie is that they fall in line with everything else that Hollywood does today and that's piggyback off of the truly great movie makers of yesterday. Zero talent in regards to coming up with your own ideas and concepts so you use one from the past, change a few things and in the end you create an extremely poor version of a great classic. Not only does the story completely change from what we know, but not one of the characters holds a candle to any of the originals. For a story placed in the 60's much of what they did change does not even seem to match up with the times. The only reason this movie gets a three from me is for the new songs in the end being semi-decent songs even though they also did not fit with the times and simply because I like many of the actors. I'm just sorry they all agreed to such a poor rendition of this timeless classic. This movie was so drastically changed from the original it should have never been considered a remake, but I gather that was done simply to ride the coat tails of a truly great story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An artistic homage to the original with it's own unique voice and fitting swan song for Ms. Houston</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in 1960s against the backdrop of the explosion of R&amp;B thanks in large part to Berry Gordy and Motown Records, Sparkle is an artistic homage to the original 1974 film with it's own unique voice. Looking to become the next Berry Gordy, a young man named Stix, played by Derek Luke (Friday Night Lights) helps three talented sisters form a R&amp;B group which he hopes to get signed to a major record label. But as fame comes their way, it becomes more of a challenge for the family to stay together. Among those standing in the way of success is the girls' mother, Emma, a jaded and bitter former singer who now wants nothing more for her than "a respectful education and a relationship with the Lord." American Idol winner, Jordin Sparks gives a adequate performance in her film debut as Sparkle, the youngest sister of the trio and Stix best chance at realizing his dream. It doesn't hurt they share the dream and a lot of chemistry. Carmen Ejogo channels Lonette McKee (Half &amp; Half) and gives a stellar performance as Sister, the oldest, most defiant sister and the one most desperate for fame and fortune. The sister that the mother Emma fears will most likely follow in her footsteps.Irony permeates a supporting part that was supposedly designed to be Whitney Houston's "comeback role" but instead sadly became her swan song. Although this was not a starring vehicle for Whitney, that fact, may be testament to her skill as an actor; not upstaging newcomer Sparks while still making her presence felt through her character's personality.Surprisingly it's Mike Epps (Next Friday) who steals the show as Satin,a paradoxically evil stand-up comedian with whom Sister falls in love. His command of the screen displays his growth as an actor since his first roles as nothing more than comedic relief or bit parts early in his career. The fact that Epps who is a hilarious comedian in real life gave such a strong performance that was intentionally not funny but intensely dramatic should speak volumes to future casting directors who may have previously seen him as a one-note actor who would forever play sidekicks like "Black Dougs" as in The Hangover and Day-Days like his character in Next Friday and its sequel. More than anything, Sparkle is a soulful musical complete with feel good R&amp;B songs from the original like the Curtis Mayfield penned "Something He Can Feel" and "Hooked on Your Love" which are beloved classics today. Other catchy original songs for the film, like the melodic "One Wing" were produced by none other that R. Kelly himself. It's the gospel cornerstone "His Eye Is On the Sparrow" however, that provides Whitney an opportunity to provide yet another (but sadly her last) powerful performance that would make her mother, gospel legend, Cissy Houston proud. Maybe it's that real life tragedy of that underlines the plot that also undermines it. Every time Whitney is on screen, one cannot help but feel a twinge of grief knowing she is no longer alive, ultimately because of the same showbiz demons that her onsceen daughter was battling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hidden treasures in Sparkle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Instead of 1950s Harlem, the eldest "Sister" and her sisters (Delores and Sparkle) were making things happen in 1960s Detroit. In the city of Motown, we see each sister's rising and failed ambitions.I didn't see the remake on the day of its release. I saw the original (1976), so skepticism was high. There are flaws, but there are hidden treasures that make it a nice rendition: Location, location, location - What better place to pursue music in the 1960s other than Detroit? Motown established acts that are still in movies and commercials. Not only is the music memorable, but so is the socio-political events. Mention of the riots raised eyebrows at the dinner table when Satin (Mike Epps) shows up. His position on the topic makes him a "coon" who later becomes ashamed of himself.In stories of aspiring talent, it's usually a dream to escape the life they were born into. In the 1960s, industrialized Detroit made it possible for families to slice a piece of the American dream: beautiful home, new car, and trendy clothes. The sisters wanted to achieve more, even though they weren't doing bad, which is a nice alteration from the original.Character development - Supporting characters shared their stories. Delores (Tika Sumpter) held her own! Her role in the family stayed true to the original, but we learn more about her personal motivation and goals. Before this, we didn't know where she was going. Emma, or Mama, (Whitney Houston) was portrayed in a different light too. In the original, Mama was a maid. In the remake, Emma was running things.Kudos to the Akils (Girlfriends, The Game, Being Mary Jane) for broadening the antagonist spectrum. Usually, the "bad boy" is a drug dealer, but not here. In the remake, he's actually a working man with issues. Last but not least, Sister (Carmen Ejogo). She shared more of her past from a young adult perspective. In the 1976 version, we were introduced to a teenager who knew how to sing and started using drugs.Domestic violence - These moments usually show a man attacking a woman. Well, Sister isn't Satin's punching bag! It's still considered domestic violence, even when a woman fights back. Bottom line, love shouldn't hurt.Conflict Resolution - The film did a great job handling redemption. Originally, Sister fell in a downward spiral and that was it. Now we see characters work through their problems. Sparkle (Jordin Sparks) sets her past delusions of life straight in order to move forward. This time, we have a better idea of how far she can go. Despite a troubling past, Mama and Sister were able to work things out. Delores confronted stereotypes, then moved on to achieve opposite of the 'norm'. Love that Levi (Omari Hardwick) redeemed himself in the eyes of Sister and Satin. Overall, the film was okay. I wish there was more to the Sparkle-Stix (Derek Luke) relationship. Costumes were overly modernized. Oh well, consider it a fashionable takeaway. R. Kelly was criticized for his musical direction, but, songs from the 1976 Sparkle will be remembered most. Sister and Sparkle's singing weren't as moving as the original singers (or even EnVogue's cover of Giving Him Something He Can Feel).Remakes are difficult to make. You have to maintain the reputation of the first, and carve out a piece of originality for a new generation. The remake maintained the storyline and gave its own shine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked it better when it was called Dreamgirls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jordin Sparks really sparkles. That's about the only thing that elevates Sparkle from a wannabe "Dreamgirls" to what it is: a star vehicle for Jodin. To promote the movie they cast Whitney Houston in big bold letters but it's really Jodin Sparks who shines as a girl from Detroit in 1968 that breaks all the molds, including her mother's, in order to become Motown's new shining star. I don't mind that her sister named Sister (Carmen Ejogo) steals the spotlight. Sister is, after all, the one that drives every man in the club insane as rabid dogs (and I mean dogs, literally) as she puts on the heat with her sensual performances. All the while, Sparkle is the talented one, the one that pens and inspires the wonderful and original music. The movie is a delight to watch for the great outfits, the club scenes, the live music that you can almost feel and makes you feel part of the audience. Frankly, I enjoy Whitney's last performance as a stern, religious mother who oppresses her daughters to be good Christian, church going women that don't get to experience life and feel forced to sneak out of their home whenever they want to go out and have a little bit of fun at the club. Other performance I enjoy is Derek Luke's (from Antwone Fisher) as Stix, the man who sees Sparkle's potential, and bends over backwards to make her the star that she's destined to be. However, not all is peaches and creme in Sparkle. There's a goofy comedian named Satin (Mike Epps) who pokes fun at his fellow black folk in his stand up routines and makes sure to flash his bling-bling around Sister, who is as pretty as she is dumb to not realize what a jerk he is. The problem I had with their toxic relationship is that they fail at capturing the severity of domestic violence and turn it into an almost comical, over the top note that should never be. How predictable is this story when it tries to imitate Tina Turner? Had anybody seen What's Love Got To Do With It? Sparkle tries to borrow many used ideas from girl group films that might have worked well in the past but bring nothing new to the table, no mystery that Sister and Satin don't get a happy ending. And what's up with those names? Really, who sits and think of naming their kids Sparkle, or Sister, or Stix, or Satin... Really, who?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Don't ever be sorry for telling the truth." Sparkle (Sparks) is a great song writer but is afraid to preform them herself. Her sister is a great singer who can seduce any crowd. Along with their other sister they form a group that is on the cusp of getting a record deal, all while keeping the secret from their mom (Houston). But not everyone can handle success. Going into this movie I was more or less expecting another version of "Dreamgirls". For the most part that is what I got. The ironic thing about this though is that the main singer in this who was trying to be like Diana Ross ended up being more like Whitney Houston (I'm not sure if she knew or not). Again though for the most part this is just a remake of "Dreamgirls", even casting another "American Idol" as the star. I can't decide what one I liked more but I'm leaning toward "Dreamgirls" mainly because I like Eddie Murphy. Overall, if you liked "Dreamgirls" you will like this one. I give it a B.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well 'Sparkle' was a surprise for me. It wasn't "the bomb" but it was a decent, wholesome watch. I ended up going to watch this movie with a friend who turned 17 today simply because she had no one else to celebrate her day with and that's the movie she wanted to watch. It's one of those movies that I never thought I'd ever pay to watch because it's not an action film and it's not exactly one you'd peg as a 'cutesie', romantic film. I enjoyed the interaction between the characters particularly Jordin and Derek's characters. It seemed like a wholesome, blossoming friendship. I enjoyed watching the interaction among the three sisters and how eventually they all became united and the younger ones became protected by the older one who was by all accounts irresponsible and self-centered. It was filled with beautiful music and it gave me goosebumps just to see Whitney in her final film with her tremendous voice. It's a good family movie despite some of the violent and sexual undercurrents. I would recommend it for those who really just want to see a good story unfold and some seriously decent singing.</fullReview>

The script is the story of a young person trying to find the courage to follow her dreams. With the help of her boyfriend who believes in her and her sisters who support her, she defies her mother and shoots for her goal.The script is well written, the acting is superb, the cinematography is just beautiful and the costumes and settings are amazing. There should be Oscar nominations for Houston for supporting actress, for costume design and for best original song. Mike Epps delivers a great performance, as does, Carmen Ejogo and Tika Sumpter and Sparkle's sisters.This was the only movie in its opening weekend to receive a solid "A" rating from moviegoers. It is funny, tension filled, and dramatic at different times, and it just works so well. This movie will work for everyone who just wants to see a good story, with good acting, that looks and sounds wonderful on the big screen. Go and see this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OMG How Ironic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are one who feels that you can't achieve what you set your mind to, then Sparkle is a movie for you! This movie is an uplifting refresher of how a girl, Sparkle, played by Jordin Sparks, had one dream and that was to be a famous singer. Her dreams constantly get torn down by her sisters, D and Sister, but mainly her mom, Emma, which is played by the famous Whitney Houston. Although many tried to steer her away from the singing business, Sparkle was determined to be what she wanted to be instead of what her mother had planned for her to be. The three sisters formed a group together, where Sister was the lead singer. They constantly snuck out in order for their mom to not find out they were going against her. All Sparkle really wanted was for her music to get noticed and if they had to sneak around to do it, she was willing to. I personally enjoyed this movie because of the different things that occurred throughout the movie were very similar to Whitney Houston's real life. Sister was known as "the mess up" because she grew up not respecting her mother and always did her own thing. Sparkle was the good little church girl who everyone loved and D was the other sister who had the aspiration of becoming a doctor. These two sisters were headed in the right direction with their lives; their mom strived for them not to become like herself or Sister. Emma was a former singer who let drugs, sex, and other things distract her from being the best singer she could be, so she quit that lifestyle and became a well-known member of the church. This is indeed very ironic because Houston grew up as that good little church girl everyone loved, but as she became more popular throughout the world, she started to abuse her fame. As the girls became popular, Sparkle started to have a relationship with one of their producers, who really enjoyed what Sparkle was doing and tried to make her get noticed. But, Sparkle didn't want to betray her mother and go against her rules, but singing was her passion and she couldn't stop. Sister started to abuse her fame and started to date the "Mr. Big Shot," Satin, played my Mike Epps. Satin was a lady's man who made Sister do drugs, drink, and drift away from her family. The group then started to go its separate ways because Sister wanted to do things on her own with Satin and although he constantly abused her, she felt as if staying with him was what's going to get her to the top. This was exactly the life Houston lived when married to Bobby Brown. He got her hooked on drugs and constantly beat her, but Houston "loved" him so much, she was willing to risk her life for someone who made her into someone the world loathed. Houston basically was forced to leave the ones she loved for Bobby and wasn't as close to her family as she used to be because Bobby and drugs were her new family. Towards the end of the movie, there was a scene where Emma was singing in church asking God why many things had to happen to her and how she wants to give her life back to Him. This was the scene that really hit home for me because of the irony. Houston lived a life for Christ before and even a little during her fame, but as the years progressed, she let fame get in the way of everything. Drugs had taken over her life and she wasn't who she used to be at all. The life she lived for the majority of the time was something no one should go through. After the movie filmed, Whitney died of a drug overdose. This makes the movie as a whole ironic because the movie hit many key points in her life and ended with her pleading to God and asking Him why she had to live the life she lived and go through all those trials. This movie is a must see if you want to see a girl who lived in constant negativity make her way out to become something positive and inspirational. I feel as if this movie showed the life Whitney Houston could've had if she chose to not abuse her fame. This movie isn't something you should just wait to rent at Red Box, go see it in theater and rent it! It's such a great movie that inspired me personally to strive for what I believe in and not let things deter me away from my goal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sparks and Houston "Sparkle" in Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sparkle is a musical drama starring former American Idol winner Jordin Sparks. The plot, centered in Detroit of the late 1960s, focuses on a tight-knit family of young women who form a pop vocal group and pursue music-business fame, all while trying to avoid the wrath of their mother. The late Whitney Houston portrays Emma, the family matriarch.Boutique manager Emma keeps her girls on a short leash. 19-year-old Sparkle dutifully keeps a job in the same store as Emma, and she participates in choir with older sister Dee (Tika Sumpter), a medical school candidate. Eldest sister Sister/Tammi (Carmen Ejogo) is recently returned from a reportedly unsuccessful stint in New York City. Sparkle composes secular songs in secret, and lately has been sneaking out to nightclubs where the outgoing Sister performs the material to excited crowds.Stix (Derek Luke), an aspiring music executive, sees both of them at the club and at church. He convinces the sisters to make a run for the big time, with him as manager. Soon, the trio of 'Sister and her Sisters' becomes a prominent local act, gaining the attention of major music labels. Meanwhile, Stix and Sparkle (whose shyness belies her own singing talent) become smitten with one another.Mike Epps convincingly plays the devious Satin: a "crossover" standup comedian who desperately wants to rebuild a rapport with African American audiences. His smooth ways?and apparent affluence?quickly win him over with Sister, but his doping and physical abuse figure to derail everyone's goals. Ejogo, easily the dramatic anchor of the film, is a revelation as Sister: a worldly and blunt counterpoint to the innocence of Sparkle, she carries the most resentment against Emma, and suffers the most by narrative's end.Houston has, in some sense, a thankless role here. Emma's stern church-lady clichés dominate her character's arc. Houston plays her as devoutly religious but visibly world-weary; the plot hints at?but never fully reveals?Emma's stunted singing career, and the film suffers for it. The audience is expected to fill in the blanks on why she's bitter. Several lines of dialogue and plot points inadvertently have an eerie ring to them in light of Houston's untimely death.The film is a remake of the 1976 original which has since gained an enduring cult status. Lead producer Bishop T.D. Jakes, co-writer Mara Brock-Akil and director Salim Akil infuse the film with standard gospel-play themes of temptation, falling from grace, forgiveness and redemption. Whether familiar with the original or not, viewers shouldn't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a little prejudice when I went to see it. I really liked the original version. But this was surprisingly better, granted doing a remake you will alway's have an advantage. In addition the the main story line they did an excellent job of painting the picture of the black culture in the 60's (that was a real plus for me) If I had a vote on "ANY" awards show I would Nominate this movie for the following. Best Cinematography Best Screenplay Best Supporting Actress- Carmen Ejogo. Of course the music was great. Jordan Sparks really impressed me I wasn't sure about her at first but she "Nailed" the songs "One Wing" &amp; "Love Will"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bottom line from a lover of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love (d) the original...it is dated, but took on some truthful subjects of the times.I also ADORE the re-make for showing a different dynamic from the "Dream Girl" franchise and really fleshing out the relationships. The film is so explosive and wonderful (in talking about the dynamics of sisters that if you know the 1st film, you re happy at the growth! There is even an addressing of changing times (68 riots in Detroit and Motowns' change) which is awesome, AND...the constance reference of ARETHA FRANKLIN-YES!!!!! If you know the back story...Aretha was supposed to be Sparkle in the orig. but I think they thought she was too chubby and took Irene, but kept her soundtrack because of her powerhouse voice. So I was very happy for the constance mention.The performers...Jordan is just as sweet and innocent as Irene, both simple, I believed her more actually. Carmen lives up to "Sister" and owns it-Well done! Amazing performance Tika bring the savvy and spirit of Marvin Gaye-Revolution!!!Whitney...My heart still cannot handle her rendition of "His Eye Is On The Sparrow" but if ever there was a swan song...this was it in such a chilling yet beautiful way.It's a solid film. You'll get this if you've seen the original then this and take from it (as I ) a heart-felt re-envisioning of a tragic yet beautiful story of family.I Loved!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today, I went to see Sparkle and let's just say that I wasn't disappointed at all. Whitney, Whitney, Whitney...... she did her thang! The whole cast was great and I discovered hidden talent among the cast that I hadn't noticed before. Wow!! Don't let the haters keep you from seeing this movie. I was singing, laughing and dancing in my seat. I was filled with emotions like never before, I can honestly say that I enjoyed Sparkle(2012) better than the original. I was born in the 60's and could easily relate to the characters in Sparkle. When I left the theater, I said to myself that I can't wait until it is released on Blue Ray(extra everything). It is always a pleasure to see and hear Whitney, loved and forever missed in my heart. Go see Sparkle! Peace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sparkle" sparkled quite brightly to me! As soon as the film opened, I knew this film was going to be special. I will admit, coming into this film, I expected it to be full of clichés of the African- American culture, repetitive and annoying musical numbers, and just plain bad acting. What a great surprise it was to negate all of those statements! "Sparkle" had so much life and so many twists and surprises. It was refreshing to see an almost all-black cast do it well and not fall into that "black film" genre. The music was impeccable. Songs like "Something He Can Feel", "His Eye is On The Sparrow", "One Wing", and "Celebrate", were performed beautifully! My only critique lies with the acting performance of Jordin Sparks. I commend her as this was her first feature, however, she needs LOTS of work with the dramatic scenes and I believe she understands this, so no biggie there. Sometimes, she just wasn't believable, but she's a rookie. Other than that, it was shot beautifully and it was an entertaining movie. My other missing stars fall with the acting of Sparks, and the ending shot that led to the credits (that was a weird ending shot). My advice = SEE IT! You'll laugh, cry, and just simply be entertained.</fullReview>

She also reminds me of Thandie Newton from "Beloved","For Colored Girls" ,&amp; "Mission Impossible 2" in terms of acting quality. Mike Epps has chosen the role of his career as Satin..he really was at his best in this film.I have never seen his characters have much depth in other films but in this one he had a a lot of material to really play with.Bravo Bravo for such a menacing portrayal. I also thought Jordin Sparks for her first feature film she did decent to good but was great the last 20 minutes wow!she just blew me away..GREAT WORK FROM EVERYONE GRADE A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie. All the actors did a great job. What a great way for Whitney to end her career with a such a beautiful project. She did a wonderful job. The story has a lot of differences from the original, but I loved these changes. I actually think this movie is superior to the original in many ways. The highlight for me was to see Whitney singing her gospel song, probably the best song performance ever captured in a movie. I read some people complain that the movie is different from the original, and I ask everyone what would be the point to copy the first movie? It would be boring. I actually find the remake more satisfying. In the first movie, the roles of the mother and also Dolores were almost non-existent, also the lighting and editing were bad. Also it was a very sad film, and while in the remake they still have sadness, it's actually more uplifting. This movie improves on everything. I'm actually planning on seeing it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chix Chat on Film Review: This film sparkles!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With so many recent remakes, it was very refreshing to see an update that was better than the original. Sparkle (Jordin Sparks) is the story of a talented young song writer who lacks the confidence to pursue a musical career on her own and is struggling to please her mother Emma (Whitney Houston) while continuing to chase her dream. I thought the line delivered by Emma in the trailer about her life being a cautionary tale was so interesting, and not to mention ironic, and it seemed that much of the story took a dramatic turn after that. There was some lighthearted humor especially Rev Bryce's (Michael Beach) dinner prayer and some surface romance but the story did not start out with any depth. In fact it was that lack of depth that had me questioning if the film was worthwhile. But when things got real, the film got real good. I know that the story was about Sparkle and her coming of age story, but being a Mocha child myself I found that I was most fascinated by Dee (Tika Sumpter) she was the most pragmatic and I was consistently nodding agreement to every line that she delivered. She is a very talented actress. She was very convincing in The Game as an addict and now is seen on the other side of the coin doling out tough love to a troubled Sister/Tammy (Carmen Ejogo). Ms. Ejogo is yet another English export who can speak American with a natural ease, she was a definite standout in this story. This film had no special effects worth mentioning, well other than Sparkle riding on the back of Stix's (Derek Luke) motorcycle and nary a hair out of place. But seriously, the story was very well written and had an exceptional cast proving that with that type of combination the special effects don't really matter. This is the first time that I have seen Mike Epps (Satin Struthers) take a turn at such a sinister character and he pulled it off. It cannot be an easy feat for a comedian to reinvent themselves as a dramatic actor, but he is making it happen on the big screen. I am glad the Bishop T.D. Jakes had a hand in the film, making it classy and classic which is exactly what should be associated with Ms. Houston's final performance. I give it a green light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film! A few Spoiler Alerts!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of the late Whitney Houston, so I had to see this to say my "goodbyes". Whitney is very good as strict mama Emma, but I can see her character worries about her daughters, Sister (Carmen Ejogo), Dee (Tika Sumpter)&amp; Sparkle (Jordin Sparks). The actress playing Sister is awesome &amp; you feel sorry for her. Dee is spunky but Sparkle is kinda like a wall flower. Only a few references to drugs, sex but has a strong violence element between sister &amp; Satin Struthers (Mike Epps). I bought the original film &amp; think the original is more grimy. Epps character is one you'd like to kick him in the pants! The music is awesome and the film looks really good. You feel like you're really in the 60's. Before this film I had never heard of Ejojo or Sumpter, but along with Sparks, they have a bright future! Ceelo Green is wasted in this film, his part is nearly a cameo! It's good to hear him sing something other than his hit "Forget You". I don't claim to be a great writer but I review only things I've seen. Hope everyone who loves a good film with good acting, singing and a good story goes to see this. Whitney would have been proud of this last film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Houston and Cast Shine in Sparkle!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Houston Shines in Sparkle.Oh Whitney. Watching Sparkle over this weekend has reminded me that she has left us far too soon. I must say that she owned the role of Emma, the matriarch of the Anderson family. She was funny, sassy, scary and loving and I kept thinking she had so much more to offer us as an actress. Without giving any spoilers away, the dinner table scene gave me chills. Whitney was able to say so much without much dialogue at the start of the scene. She was acting with her eyes and I was so impressed with her. I must say the entire cast did a great job. This was Jordin Sparks first role and she held her own quite well. There were a few moments where you could tell she was a beginner but overall, she did her thing. My favorite Jordin moment had to be at the end when she finally gets her moment to shine and boy does she.Carmen Ejogo as Sister was phenomenal! She really had big shoes to fill and she filled them with ease, sophistication and passion. I was completely mesmerized by her when she was performing on stage, every single time. She also really tapped into a genuine place as a broken woman, who really wants to be loved and accepted. Tika Sumpter did really well too. I was glad they fleshed out the character of Dee so well and she brought this fiery energy to her.Mike Epps was incredible as the evil Satin and I couldn't keep my eyes off of him every time he was on the screen. He had this magic and creepiness about him that made you enjoy his evilness somewhat. Derek Luke and Omar Hardwick were also great in their roles as well. They had a really intense scene together, that they both played with such honesty and heart. I could relate to both of them and feel empathy for both. The ensemble cast was also really well rounded out. There was no weak link in this ensemble to be honest. I loved the Ceelo Green cameo, he kicked off the movie really well.The music was great, as were the updates to the script. I really enjoyed how they fleshed out the characters and all the sisters had a real back story. There was a great twist that I was not expecting and really enjoyed it. I was taken a back by it at first, but it really worked in the remake and was happy that they included that. I was impressed that the writers kept the back bone of the story but were able to really expand on the characters, update the story to make it relevant for todays audiences but kept the grit and intensity of the original. The costumes were fantastic and really fit the era. I also really enjoyed the direction and cinematography. The movie is beautifully shot and the actors look great. You can tell the lighting know how to light black actors. Salim, the director, really added some nice transitions that really captured the essence of the 60's.I loved the record shop scene and how all of the performances were shot.One complaint I had about the film was at some parts the editing and pacing were weird. Whitney's solo came at an appropriate time in the script, but I felt the transition into it could have been smoother. Also the ending transition could have been better after her solo as well. The end of the film came abruptly and I just wish they would have kept about 5-10 more minutes to flesh out the ending a little better. But the actual pacing of the film was great. There was not one point that I was bored.Sparkle is obviously not a very original story, but features so much heart that you can't but fall in love with these characters. It reminds me of those classic feel good musicals that leaves the audience singing and dancing in the aisles. You can tell everyone went into this project with the intent of making a beautiful and well received film and they have succeeded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie go and see it !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow is the best word for what I feel!! First just so you know I am going to go into depth, on everything. No spoilers here !! But I will talk a while about the over all performances. And I really got a good sense of it all too, cause there were only like 10 or so people in the theater . But it was cool it was for midnight and I don't live in that big of a place and the crowd was still into it.First let me just say on the movie! It was very good everyone in the cast did a commendable job!! Honestly I feel if the cast was full of no names I would have thoroughly enjoyed it still !!It had just enough of everything. Sometimes I really had chills/tears and was on the edge of my seat. And I will say to people who read the script, it is not the same thing. I myself read the original script and there are even more changes in this. So don't think you know what is going on. It was better than the original film (which I have seen) in my opinion. I think I will start with Miss. Whitney Houston :) !! It was not acting it couldn't have been she was just natural in this role you would think she wrote the lines. I can say I thought she would be in the film more, don't get me wrong she is in the film quite a bit but sometimes it just felt like a while. And let me tell you did she bring down th house on Sparrow (chills tears everything) !!!! I mean really, and she sounded totally different than the CD to me, (actually most of the music sounded better when seeing it and hearing it in the film!!) But anyway she sounded amazing during Sparrow!! She was impressive, as for awards I don't know, she def. has some stiff competition from this cast alone. She can probably get like image bet golden globe though. But I don't know about Oscar.Now onto the leading lady Miss Sparks. Great really! So natural and flowing. At first I was nervous like she was gonna be rough but that thought went out of my head almost immediately. I felt like a proud parent. And her character arc was amazing. She really grew throughout the film. And her songs as well sounded better in the film. Especially Look into your heart, cause I was not crazy for it off the soundtrack!! And one thing I really like of her character is she is much more involved, and its not all the Sister show!! But sister is still there and her struggle is still seen. But ill get to that soon. But Jordin really did good. Come on now One Wing was amazing !! Possibly award talk but I doubt it but she did do excellent, but she can only get better if she continues movies maybe awards in the future probably not for Sparkle though, but it will put her on a new level of Fame.Carmen Ejogo!! I really felt so bad for Sister leaving the theater, my heart just really hurt for her. I can say I think she was better than Lonette McKee, I thought it was bad for Sista then but didn't really feel emotion Carmen gave me chills. I just really so sad. People say that it parallels Whitney but I sincerely hope Whitney never got to the depths of Sister, :( . But she really gave a good performance. And made you want to root even though it was obvious she wasn't gonna make the right choices. Remarkable !! Definitely possible Oscar.Tika !! I love her Delores, so fun and sassy, so much better in this movie than the original she actually has a personality in this. The only level headed one in the movie. The regular person. I enjoyed Tikas performance, and she can totally bring the sass !! Bright future ! Now Derek he also did a nice. He was a well leading man. I really thought he brought it. He and Jordin had very nice chemistry, some of their scenes made me smile at how cute they were together. :) He really is a great actor, not that that was ever really up in the air, who saw Antwone Fisher!! And he adapted nicely to being a regular guy, all of his roles usually are challenging.Omari: I liked his character although I wish he were in the movie more, although when he was he brought it! You really feel for him throughout. And his last scene with Carmen mad me feel, just the look he gave her. This would give away too much if I went any deeper into Levi !! But it was a nice job.Mike Epps !!! Now Sister and Satin were the power couple of this film they both brought it! Nice job Mike you showed you can act !! Like I really hated him when he beat Sister!! And hated him even more towards then end. I just wish I could talk about it, people need to hurry and see this movie so I can let spoilers out freely :) But I wont ruin it. But really a nice job!! And he also may be worthy of some awards, which awards??? only time will tell! The movie really impressed me, great ensemble cast. As for Goapele and Cee Lo ... good as well, although Goapele only performed, and Cee lo was actually a bit annoying his whole 5 min. Great movie !!!!!!!!!!! :) &lt;3</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sparkle Not So Much, Nice Shine is More Like It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm seeing ghosts! At least I thought I was when I saw that Whitney Houston was starring in a movie. However, I haven't received the gift to see dead people, nor have I gone crazy. Instead I went to see the latest musical drama entitled Sparkle, a movie about an African American girl of the same name. Sparkle (Jordin Sparks) has a dream to make it big as a musician, but her stage fright and lack of confidence leaves her hiding in the shadows while her sister Sister(Carmen Ejogo) lights up the stage. To her luck, a young upcoming agent named Stix (Derek Luke) pursues Sparkle and her sisters and attempts to help make them stars in Motown. However, Sparkle's life has some complications that will test her character and squash her dreams, especially from her mother (Houston). Will she succeed?Does it sound interesting to you? It didn't to me, but I went to this film hoping to be surprised or impressed by something. As usual, we'll start with the things that did impress me in this film and the first thing I'll mention is the setting. Tristar pictures did a nice job bringing the late 60's Motown world to life with all of its funky soul and gospel power. The club scene at the beginning is a just the start of the impressive scenery work of the group and helps bring the audience into the world a little bit. Throw in some well designed outfits and classic mannerisms to help spice up things and you get an impressive artificial MoTown. Speaking of outfits, the wardrobe department applied their skills well as each of the three sisters wore their own style in both clothes and hair styles. Various jokes and cultural reference spanned off of the outfits (most of which was clever and cute), and from how the older audience members were reacting seemed to take them back to the good times. If setting and outfits aren't your cup of tea, then the next strength would probably be the music of this movie. I'll warn you now that this movie is all about the soul, jazz, and blues music and those who would rather stick carrots in their ears than listen to this music should avoid it. From the start Cee-Lo Green gets the score pumping with an upbeat, and surprisingly clean, jazz song that will get you rocking in your seat. After that the music goes into a variety of emotion filled blue tunes, a couple of upbeat hits, and of course one or two gospel like melodies that may you have clapping in awe. While I'm not the biggest fans of these styles, I have to admit that these girls can sing. Sparks in particular puts her chords to the test as she hits high pitched notes that drag on for half a minute. Her powerful voice and spirit in her numbers captures the emotion of the tune, somehow bringing her thoughts and passion to life. Ejogo has some pipes as well, but her numbers are more of a storytelling/entertaining bit that made some of the audience members howl in delight at her gorgeous body. As you can guess Houston does well too, but she has only one song on the list that has some power to it, but plays little purpose other than showing off talent. One last thing to mention is that the songs were selected to coincide with the attitude of the movie at that point. Happy moments had the girls singing upbeat numbers, while sadder parts of the story had blues and soul music to help mirror the dismay and redemption. It's artistic, sappy, and cliché, but it's something I have to give props to for helping drive the movie along.Now let me discuss the weaknesses of the film. For one thing this drama surprisingly has little character and story development for such a cast. Sure there is the main plot story of Sparkle wanting to become a star, but aside from that the shallow subplots, love interests, and backstory are cheated out. From the trailers you might know that the girls' mother failed in the music industry, but Houston's character never really told us the details of what happened. Another sister had career desires, but they just skimmed over that and showed very little struggle or challenge to her goals. There is one positive to this shallow story/character design and that is less time dwelling on a rather stale drama. Skipping on these details again denies the audience story for their money, it helps get them to the musical songs (and consequentially the ending) faster. Unfortunately this fast pace fails as one gets closer to the end, where they then decided to drag out the painfully slow details. While you finally get a few happy ties to the story, by that point I just didn't care from the spiraling downfall the story was, and just wanted to be out of the theater. However, those who love good closure on their drama will enjoy the last thirty minutes of the movie, especially if you are a Jordan Sparks fan. Other than that there is a little overacting, a lot depressing problems that may bring you down, and a few editing issues that need to be wrapped up.Sparkle definitely isn't as shiny as the trailers made it, but it's not the worse movie I've seen this summer. Fans of the culture and music of the 60's will probably enjoy this movie more than anyone else, especially fans of Sparks' powerful voice. However, the pace of this movie, lack of real character development, and irregular pace makes this movie a Netflix at best so that you can turn it off if you don't like it and save yourself the time. My scores for this movie are the following: Drama: 6.0 Movie Overall: 5.0-5.5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was really trying to hard to be a hit, you can really tell. I can't really elaborate much because you have to see it; there are some great little bits and every scene with Whitney, yeah you guessed it.. She kinda steals the show but she isn't in it as much as people would like or as much as people think considering that she is selling this movie. I just thought it seemed a bit too try-hard, at one moment it felt tongue-in-cheek, then it felt Disney.. It was weird. I'm giving it 5/10 for the relationship between Sticks &amp; Sparkle because they were wonderful to watch together but mostly the 5/10 is for Whitney. If Whitney were alive? I think I'd be giving this movie a lower rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The year's most tedious musical, the new Sparkle, has hit the late summer screens with a whimper, and that includes all the respect I can give to producer and supporting actress Whitney Houston. But the late star should have known that the old star is born motif needs more than clichés, and I wish she hadn't awarded herself the most thankless role in the movie. American Idol's Jordin Sparks plays Sparkle, the most demure of three singing sisters in the early sixties but potentially the most talented of them all through her writing. Suffice it to say the languid 116 minutes contain the usual ups and downs associated with singing groups on film with the obvious purpose to crown one as a star. Houston's role of the overprotective mother may be slightly more rewarding than Derek Luke's as the loving, sometimes manipulative and self-centered manager. Wait, wait, I have another more unsympathetically clichéd character: Satin, the black TV comedian, played smarmy and brutal as is convention by Mike Epps. Satin scoops up the flashiest, sexiest of the sisters only to make everyone sorry he did. No surprises. Throughout this mediocre musical retreading, too few musical numbers occur, and when they do, they too loosely fit the storyline of the emerging trio and infrequently give the audience superior music. I love screen musicals like Chicago and even Step Up, but Sparkle for a new age is too old a vibe.</fullReview>
