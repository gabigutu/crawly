		<shortDescription>An under-rated classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Point Break is one of those films that everybody loves, but that nobody actually talks about all that often. It is a film that if you mention it in conversation, everyone else around is bound to say how much they enjoyed it.The film's two main assets are unexpected ones, in the form of the direction and the script. The direction by Kathryn Bigelow is nothing short of excellent. Her handling of the action and suspense scenes is exciting and riveting. The two sky-diving scenes are brilliant as is the foot chase through the streets (and houses) of the city. The script, by W. Peter Illif, is also very good and the best thing about the film. The plot is multi-layered and has an original relationship between the hero and the villain. The way the story resolves itself and the ultimate resolutions is excellent, by the standards of most Hollywood action films.This film deserves to be remembered as one of the better actioners of the nineties, not up there with Die Hard 2/3 or Speed, but better than 90% of the action junk made nowadays. At least this film has a plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies are like Bands. People come together--maybe they're not even the greatest musicians individually--but together, something meshes and they make great music. It takes more than great musicians to make a great band. Just so, some movies, no matter how much money, talent, and horsepower is brought to bear, just don't coalesce. Others, like Point Break, come together with an ineffable "rightness" that defies any of the parts, logic, or analysis. This is one of my favorite movies. Period. Everything "works." This movie ROCKS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film for an adrenaline generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thirteen years on it sounds a little trite - an FBI agent examines his inner self whilst trying to bring down a gang of surfer bank robbers by infiltrating their scene. But dude, how Point Break pulled this off!In what can now safely be regarded as one of the more generation-defining cinematic moments of the nineties, Point Break serves as not just a credible well-paced action thriller spectacle, but also as a voice for advocates of the adrenalin rush. The movie's sleeper popularity at the time would no doubt have helped issue in a new generation of 'X' sports for a new generation, as hungry sponsors leapt at a new market.Kathryn Bigelow takes some key pointers from then hubby James Cameron and paces the movie brilliantly. There are many key moments of unique action - that chute-less jump from 4,000 feet being the highlight - that filled the trailer, but it is the cumulative effect of bringing these moments together that adds to the picture. For so many films the denouement is a gross failure but Bigelow controls the films peaks and troughs expertly and the ending is genuinely well handled, something that appears to be a real struggle for Hollywood today.In what will go down as Patrick Swayze's finest moment on film, he plays the adrenalin guru Bodhi with glaze-eyed and silver tongued expertise, and manages to pull off the very difficult assignment of being both sane and insane simultaneously with accomplishment.You can almost feel pulled by Bodhi's enthusiasm for a sensation 'as close as you get to God', and as a result can excuse the decade for being labeled that of the 'slacker' generation. The nineties weren't about slacking, just looking for a different kind of high.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, sure it is just a big action film with a flimsy script and crazy stunts but.... it is filmed so great. It feels so summer in Cali. It makes you want to forget your blah zaa blah job, move to the beach and surf your azz off and have summer bonfires all night and party the night away. I have been reading others comments on why they can't understand the guilty pleasure about this movie.... Duh that's the whole idea. Yes you can like movies that have you thinking about this and that at the end. You can have movies that astound you. And of course you can have movies that can make you feel like you had a great F'N experience. This is what this movie is. Eat your popcorn. Dive into it AND have a great time. Who cares about the social impact. Enjoy it and think about this. Sex Wax! If it's in the movie, it's a FUN movie! Holla</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So you've decided to live like Bodhi.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a couple of things you should remember before attempting to become a bank robbing surf god.First: Odd's are you are no where near as cool as Bodhi and that's a major hill to climb. Here's my advice on that subject. Start smoking, everyone's a little bit cooler if they smoke. Then start drinking. A man will always be judged on how much alcohol he can consume and a woman will always be impressed, whether she likes it or not. You might also want to pick up a copy of Road House.Second: Change your appearance. Actually you might want to start working on this immediately, as it's probably the most difficult. Grow your hair out, then use "sun in" everyday for 3 weeks. Repeat for goatee. Then go shopping. Hit up the local surf store. There your find all the ponchos and skids you will need. If there's no surf store, find a good will or second-hand shop.Third: Meet new friends. By now you're strung out and paranoid from being alone all the time. You're going to need people to follow and worship you. Try making pamphlets explaining your cause. If pamphlets don't work, actually try talking to people. Instead of asking for change this time, try discussing sports or politics. And I know what you're thinking, finding friends is hard. Can't find them, buy them.Finally: Funding. So you think you're ready to surf the big waves. The next step is to find money. Banks have plenty of money. Try asking nicely if they could give you some donations. If that doesn't work, try getting a job. If that doesn't work. Try robbing the bank you first went too. If that doesn't work. Start lifting weights. In jail you're going to need be able to defend yourself. Repeat step 1, watch Road House. Patrick Swayze kills like 7 people in that movie.You're on your way. Remember your roots. You're freaking Patrick Swayze. He once survived a plane crash. He was flying the plane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great "new age" action thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Katheryn Bigelow's 1991 action thriller "Point Break" is still a ground-breaking film of the early nineties. It tells the story of the cop John Utah (Keanu Reaves) hunting a bunch of bank robbers camouflaged with masks of the former U.S. presidents. His investigations leads to a group of surfers and extreme sports worshippers, and the cop becomes fascinated by the free-style philosophies and adrenaline rushes of the gang around the charismatic leader Bodhi (Patrick Swayze). Their close friendship changes to a hard-fought rivalry at the end when cop and gangsters face point blank.Bigelow uses typically American surf beach settings for this unusual and very stylish action thriller with great stunts like parachuting scenes, bank robberies, a car chase, police raids, martial arts, breath-taking chases and brilliantly photographed surf sequences. Watch out for the Red Hot Chillie Peppers as a gang of brutal surf nazis beating up Keanu Reeves and being captured by him during a hard-fought police raid.But "Point Break" is even more than that - it also shows the lifestyle of the nineties in many ways. Bodie and his gang are a group of New Age-like grunge guys reaching out for the most extreme adrenaline experiences. They stand for the new style of extreme/fun sport worshippers, ravers and new spiritualists of the post-yuppie era in the nineties who don't care about wealth and status symbols but for fun, action, breaking the limits and finding the sum of all senses. "Point Break" is not only a well-done example of modern action entertainment without computer-generated special effects but also a very philosophical and spiritual study of society in the nineties.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must have seen this film a dozen times now, and I'm not going to stop watching it until I'm well and truly sick of it - it's just superb.Certain sequences are stunning - the camera work during the chase and free fall scenes leave you breathless, and the surfing footage is excellent. The acting is generally good, particularly Busey as a veteran FBI agent, but Keanu's usual expressionless vocals and face disappoint. The script is sharp and witty. And the stunts really shine, particularly the Bond-style psycho skydiving near the end.This is, in my opinion, a very underrated film which deserved better from the critics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like this movie. I can't really go into why too much but I can tell you that I watch this flick everytime it comes on cable if I'm home. I think it's worth a couple of hours of your day. It first comes off as kind of hokey but somehow ends up becoming very engrossing. Keanu Reeves gives us a nice display of things to come in his career as this movie was released pre-Speed and Matrix. Patrick Swayze gives us a nice little performance as surfing zen Bodhi. The surfing scenes are well done and so are the bank robbery pieces. Kathryn Bigelow does a good job directing this one and the rest of the cast, especially Gary Busey, turn in solid performances. Note the chase scene with Keanu Reeves going after a Ronald Reagan masked Swayze: I'd put it in the top ten chase scenes of all times and I think most people would agree with me on that one. Definitely worth checking out. **** out of *****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Die Hard might be the greatest action movie of all time, but "Point Break" is not too far behind. Keanu Reeves plays federal agent Johnny Utah(a role he was born to play) who is teamed up with a veteran federal agent Angelo played by Gary Busey to crack the case of the ex president bank robbers. Angelo has a theory that the bank robbers are surfers, and Johnny goes undercover as a surfer to bust the bank robbers. Along the way he meets adrenaline junkie Bohdi played by Patrick Swayze. Well I am not going to give anymore away. This movie has some of the most amazing action scenes ever! It is highly entertaining and very quotable. Reeves is playing a role he was born to play(next to Ted in Bill and Ted) and Swayze has a lot of fun in his role. The movie is also very quotable and has a great soundtrack. So if you are in the video store looking for a good action film rent "Point Break". "Vayo Con Dios"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roller-coaster of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many other people, I first heard of Point Break in "Hot Fuzz" - an all-time favourite of mine - but never got round to watching it for numerous reasons. I saw it was available on BBC iPlayer as it had been aired recently, so I thought - why the hell not?I'm so pleased I did.If you're fond of action films like Die Hard, you're going to love this. Abandoning the stereotypical urban setting for such films, and moving out to the coast, it provides a unique mashup combining my stereotypical view of adrenaline-fixed surfers with a killer plot.Although I saw the events that happen after the tables turn about an hour in coming a mile off (after seeing enough detective dramas on ITV3, you get to know how a writer's mind works) the emotional attachment you have with the characters provides you with a huge moral dilemma. You can see the 'bad' guys are actually alright people when they're off-duty - yet you know what they do on-duty is morally wrong on every level. The ending plays on this massively, and is the only way to satisfy both sides of the moral argument, for better or for worse.Sure, a few sequences aren't in any way realistic (like the jump about 10 mins from the end) but if you suspend belief for a moment, and accept this film for what it is rather than a serious crime drama, you'll agree that this is one hell of a film.10/10 - ordering it on blu-ray after I've typed this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mind game -- and action!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's bad-ass bank robbery and cool surfing. But what makes this movie great is the mind game between the characters. Kudos to W. Peter Iliff for writing the movie and to Kathryn Bigelow for the direction. If you haven't seen the movie yet, stop here, as the rest of this review is a spoiler.If you've seen the movie, take a moment to think about what's going on in the minds of the characters.Think about the scene that takes place in Johnny Utah's apartment after he failed to chase down the gang of masked bank robbers. Utah records a message to his girlfriend, time passes, he hears the bell, comes to the door, says her name, opens the door and we see... the surfers themselves.That is such a great moment. First, it's totally unexpected. Second, we get a deja-vu -- it's a familiar sight -- we've seen a previous scene when surfers come to Utah's apartment uninvited. Third, and most importantly, we immediately sense that something's wrong. After Utah witnessed them doing the last robbery, why do they now show up in his apartment acting like nothing's happened? That's the awesome part. Think about what's going on in the minds of the characters: * Utah knows that the surfers are the gang of bank robbers * the surfers know that Utah is an undercover FBI agent * Utah knows that the surfers know that Utah is an undercover FBI agent* the surfers know that Utah knows that they are the gang of bank robbers * but Utah doesn't have a proof that the surfers are the robbers * the surfers know that Utah doesn't have a proof that they are the robbers * Utah knows that the surfers know that Utah doesn't have a proof that they are the robbersBut they engage in a mind game, because they both have something to achieve:* Utah wants to keep hanging on with the surfers, because that provides him with an opportunity to gather information where they would go in case they "disappear" and also gather proof that they are the bank robbers * Bodhi (the leader of the surfers) wants to keep hanging on with Utah, because he wants to "handle" the situation of the undercover agent. At this point, it is not revealed to the audience what Bodhi is planning to do. Bodhi is leading the game at this point and we are all pondering at how the story will unfold.And there are other important rule of the game: Utah shouldn't confront the surfers with the fact that he knows that they are the bank robbers and the surfers shouldn't confront Utah with the fact that they know that he is an FBI agent. That's because the interaction may get too confrontational and unpredictable then and either party may walk away.A crucial component that makes that mind game possible is that by now a bond of mutual understanding has formed between the two main characters. So at this point: IT IS RATIONAL TO BOTH UTAH AND THE SURFERS TO KEEP PLAYING THEIR ROLES AND UPHOLD THE MASQUERADE EVEN THOUGH THEY BOTH KNOW THAT BOTH SIDES ARE FAKING.THAT'S AWESOME.And the mind game gets truly spectacular when they are on the plane and about to jump out and Utah asks "who packed my chute?". He knows that the surfers would benefit from him dying in an mock "accident". And Bodhi understands that Utah has a rational reservation here, so he offers him his chute -- and even offers him to pick anybody else's chute. By doing that he's saying "no, killing you in a mock accident is not why I've brought you here, I have something else in mind". But he doesn't have to say that. Utah understands. That's awesome.And there's the awesome moment when Utah tries to "undo the spell" by shouting "I AM AN F-B-I AGENT!" to the surfers. But it doesn't work -- the masquerade and reality have blended by now.Everything in the movie prepares us for this. The characters are revealed step by step, as we are shown that they are capable of understanding the game and willing to take the risk of participating in it: * Pappas (Utah's FBI partner) calls the gang "the most professional he has ever seen". * Bondhi is called an "adrenaline junkie" by his former girlfriend. * Utah's boss mentions that Utah graduated from the cadet school within the top 2% -- which demonstrates his ambition and intelligence * Utah tries to surf without any training -- and almost drowns -- which demonstrates his dedicationNone of that is accidental in a movie, it's the hard work of the writer, the director and everyone else involved in the film. W. Peter Iliff and Kathryn Bigelow -- Google them up and remember the names.A sequel to Point Break is in the making!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reason why I like this movie that much and I rate it so high is more personal than I believe most viewers see this. The movie itself is a great 90's action film. It has cops, bank robbers, sunny California, great chase scenes by car and on foot, a police operation, a love story, intense relationships, some truly inspiring scenes etc. It's awesome stuff.Keanu Reeves (Johnny Utah) was young and fearless. A great performance by him. Patrick Swayze (Bodhi) rocked the beginning of 90's. This is by far his greatest performance. What an attitude to show the soul of the real searcher.Watching this movie makes me relieved. Surfing is one the most greatest activities there is. I wish I could live near the Pacific in California and surf like the dudes in Point Break. This is a totally free spirit movie. And it's for adrenaline lovers. Take a look at the sky diving scene. Incredible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather pointless to review such a film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is pop music. No one can explain why "I am the Walrus" is greater than the "Missa Solemnis"... if it is for them.Anyway, along with Rashomon, Black Narcissus, Great Expectations, Terminator and other totally absurd confections this happens to hit the spot - mainly because of the aerial sequence, which is a perceptual/experiential blast, and thus provides a mind-altering objective correlative for the Californian-mumbo-jumbo take on life which serves to drive the morality of the film. But many people, Bro, won't get it. Just as Patricia Highsmith's books are 'better than literature' in PJ O'Rourke's neat formulation, so Point Break transcends criticism... like... TOTALLY... and HYPER-REALLY.However I haven't seen it for a while so I may disagree with myself when I do. Last and least of all it inspired Hot Fuzz which is a more than passably good/funny British Film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FBI agent going up against a bank robberies executed by a band masked like US President, wearing Johnson, Carter, Nixon and Reagan masks. Although they never shoot anybody and never go into the vaults. The agent is hot on the trail but he's sucked by Patrick Swayze guru, a leader of the beach subculture, a fun-loving with destructive ways who plays cat and mouse game with the Feds. Meanwhile Reeves falls in love with Lori Petti, a beautiful surfing trainer.This is a story of surfers and skydivers in Southern California. Impressive scenario and there are enough dazzling surfing and airborne stunts to keep you amused. Keanu Reeves as astute agent and Patrick Swayze as a thrill-seeker guru, help raise potential action-adventure story to a higher plane. Emotive and moving musical score by means of synthesizer, is splendidly made by Mark Isham with a Vangelis style. The film created the 'Skydiving sub-genre', such as, ¨Drop zone(John Badham), Terminal velocity(Deran Serafian) and Cutaway(Guy Manos)¨ among others. Nostalgic surfers with more than a little patience because the runtime is about two half and some, will enjoy this ode to the beach and mysticism and seeking the perfect wave. It's well directed by Kathryn Bigelow with a perfect and assured direction which keeps this movie on the edge of your seat.</fullReview>

I mean really, if you cannot get your head around the basic plot and FUN, yes fun, that is Point Break; then i suggest you wrap your head around a washing pole or something.Yes, the storyline is a tad unbelievable and yes Keanu Reeves sounds dumb. That has more to do with where he comes from as funnily enough people pick up accents and dialects from where they come from. Yes?OK, so the film? It has surfing and the Swayze in it, i mean what more do you need? This is definitely in a list of my favourite films and i don't care what anyone says. Plenty of action, big surf scenes, an amazing parachute jump/fight and it has the Swayze and Lori Petty in it.No it's not a life changing experience but it does do what films are supposed to do, that being it makes you forget where you are for a couple of hours.

		<fullReview>Watched this again recently and sat there and thought how did i not like this in the 90s? I recall watching it when it first came out and it kind of passed me by at that point. Re-watching it recently awakened all the nostalgia of the 1990's and reminded me how great that time was. The story is excellently laid out with Patrick cast to a tee as the surfer. Lori Petty is also fab as the lead female she is perfect for the part. I was surprised to learn apart from tank girl she has done little of note since this film - maybe a bit too quirky for Hollywood? Keanu actually looks at times like he is reading an autocue (which i think is why i missed the point on 1st watch) but i think this actually adds to his character in the film - don't ask me how! One of my favourite parts is surprisingly not the action parts but the part where Keanu is getting disciplined by his boss for having a surf board in the office, it actually reminds me of some of the national lampoons parodies of "bad cop" bosses. It is so off the wall. Excellent film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He gets beat up again!?!?!?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the review with hilarious spoilers. This is the movie where Keanu Reeves gets his butt kicked. A lot. As a matter of fact, at least 6 times he fails in a fight, chase, or action scene. This is the movie where the good guys fail at everything and the bad guys succeed in almost every possible way---whether it is by outsmarting the good guys or because the good guys are idiots. This is the action flick that proves you don't need special effects, but you do need someone in the background keeping tally of who is beating who in the film ("Um, Mrs. Bigelow, why is Keanu Reeves getting beat down by a naked woman?")Point Break is one of the signature action flicks of the 90s. Why you ask? Because a bunch of violent hippie-like surfers (that love extreme sports) are robbing banks around California and an ex-football player-turned cop must stop them by becoming one of them. Yep, this plot sounds like it's going somewhere. The main character's name is Johnny Utah. Come on now, any movie with a main character that cool of a name is bound to be a hell of a good time, right? Then we have Patrick Swayze as one of the "surfer hippies" (awesome performance) and the always-reliable Gary Busey as the partner. This has all the makings of an action classic, and the opening credits just started.The script was clever, and was something very different in the realm of action flicks. This movie was W. Peter Iliff''s best script and it's a shame after Patriot Games he didn't dwell more into the genre. There was only one issue with the script. No, it's not the dialogue, no it's not the pacing, but it's the extremely weak and pathetic main character. Our main character loses so many fights, we stop rooting for him halfway because we are sure the end result would be the same----failure. He doesn't listen, he's not very smart, he's obviously not very strong, and he mellows down to a pathetic wanna-be hero that chases the main villain like a lost puppy. There can be cases of good movies where the villains are just so much smarter than the heroes (The Dark Knight anyone?), but there are some extreme cases in which you wonder why the members of the police force still have their job based off their decision-making. Keanu Reeves in the movie almost loses a fight against surfers, and does indeed lose against a naked woman, against bank robbers, against one guy (multiple times), against a man on fire, against gravity, and couldn't even succeed in a single chase. And he was a football player. Did I already say he lost to a female taking a shower? I did? I'll say it again anyway. Gary Busey should have ditched this guy halfway through the production, but then we the audience would definitely have known by then that Mr. Utah just wasn't going to win at anything. Unfortunately, he stuck around, giving Utah hope. Oops. Luckily we have great direction from Kathryn Bigelow and superb stuntwork. Bigelow must have been against special effects, because this entire movie is stuntwork and pyrotechnics-driven, as we see skydiving, surfing, crazy stunts, and one of the best on-foot chases in the history of cinema----despite it ending weakly. Bigelow is one of the more underrated directors out there, as she avoids pulling punches and avoids the clichés throughout the entire production. She also crafts great performances from Busey, Swayze, and also John C. McGinley. As for Keanu Reeves, he does a decent job, but his character prevents him from delivering anything memorable. Mr. Utah is a law enforcement joke. Bottom Line: Point Break is a swell action flick, as long as you can get past Keanu getting smacked around constantly, as he loses fights, loses arguments, constantly loses control of the situation at hand, and constantly fails in achieving his goal. It was laughable the amount of times he screws up, and the amount of times his peers screwed up. No wonder the bank robbers were having no problems taking over the city banks. Despite this fact, the movie is fun, furious, raw, and one of the signature action flicks of the 1990s. P.S. Keanu Reeves gets beat up by a naked woman. Just wanted to say that one more time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would recommend this movie if you want to watch an action film that, despite its best efforts, is a comedy. This movie is quite entertaining for the simple fact that everything is so ridiculous that it becomes comical. That, and it does contain what I and several of my friends consider to be the best line in the history of cinema (after learning he has to go under cover to become a surfer, a bewildered Keanu asks, "But how am I gonna convince them I'm a surfer?"). XXX has nothing on Point Break. There is a theater group in Minneapolis that performs this film by having Keanu's role of Jonny Utah played by an audience member, the idea being that the untrained audience member can do just as good or better than Keanu. That fact alone I feel sums up why this movie is worth watching (once). There's not much else worth saying?no real plot to analyze, no impressive acting, just a really funny movie that almost all of those involved in the making of it would most likely want to forget (Mr. Busey being the lone exception; the man turns in another brilliant performance).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Early-90's Action Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I almost forgot what a pretty boy Keanu Reeves used to be.On the most superficial level, this movie is just your basic 90's action cop-thriller, this time with surfers and skydivers.It's a bit dated but still charming at this point, like something Key and Peele would spoof on their sketch comedy show. Keanu Reeves' acting is a bit uneven, often good, but other times cheesy and laughable. Patrick Swayze in particular was perfectly cast, he really inhabits the role of the legendary Bodhi, god rest his soul.But the movie does have a touch of depth to it: There are themes of brotherhood, bonds between men, the romance of masculinity, a bit like Fight Club. It's kind of homo-erotic to be honest, with all the lingering shots of tight, toned, tanned male bodies frolicking in the ocean, but there ain't nothing' wrong with that.The movie also touches on the symbolism of the ocean, the unfathomable mysteries of the spirit, the conflict between mind and body, between order and chaos, parallels the conflict between the police and the surfers.So, if you are thinking of watching this movie, it's good enough, give it a shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Point Break an FBI agent goes undercover to catch a gang of bank robbers who may be surfers. It is in people's nature to put down great things and to nit-pick or sometimes just be plain mean. No matter what anyone says, this is utterly fantastic. The kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. That said, the main plot of the film was constantly being interrupted. The directing, music, editing, etc are not focused on at all. If you can find it on DVD or Bluray for under $13, buy it, but it won't be worth much more than that to you because it's a bit outdated. Even still, surf's up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Point Break(1991) Point Break isn't terrible, it's just not great. Don't misunderstand me, I do like certain things here. The opening bank robbery scene was good and full of energy. The security camera footage on the other hand looked so fake. I like the ex-presidents gimmick the crooks had going. The casting is good too. Problems are the plot and story. I just do not understand it at all. Also suspecting the crooks were surfers because of wax? Okay, whatever. One other good thing here is an intense foot chase. The foot chase was very well done and contains high amounts of energy. The acting was okay, nothing special. I just thought this could have been a better movie.The Last Word: This is okay. Nothing special. With the mixture of the good stuff and bad stuff, overall became one big mishmash. See it yourself and decide if you enjoy this. Could qualify as a guilty pleasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragic story about the homoerotic relationship between an FBI agent and a surfer in LA.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good directing and crisp editing can't save this mindless overwrought film. Keanu Reeves is his reliably wooden self as an FBI agent who maybe likes Patrick Swayze's bank robber/surfer character a little too much. I love Reeves line to Swayze near the end, 'You crossed the line. People trusted you and they died.' (sic) I'd add: 'And oh yeah, you broke the law a lot, terrorized a lot of innocent people, murdered a cop, kidnapped and almost had my girl killed and you've been generally an insufferable, pompous megalomaniac.' Then I'd have shot him in the knee and arrested him. But that's just me. Reeves lets him surf off into oblivion because the movie is really about the love/hate relationship between these two space cases.All that aside, the story and dialogue is all nonsense and the acting ranges from adequate to bad tho Busey almost succeeds in making a character you could give a damn about. A nice film to look at but not to listen to.</fullReview>

Point Break the Original not the crappy remake is an amazing movie and as much as i loved Speed this was the better movie especially when you have Patrick Swayze, Keanu Reeves and Gary Busey but also James Cameron as an Executive Producer this is easily the best movie about cops, robbers, surfing and sky diving that you're likely to see. And for the most part the acting was fine especially in front of the horrible remake and also the ending was pretty nice best death ever that's for sure. Point Break is everything that was right with the 90's the music, the actors, the action and suspense something that Hollywood tries to recycle over and over again in dumb remakes that copy half of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular popcorn flick for action fans everywhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1990s were the home of some of the most respected action films that went on to become cult classic to this day. When it comes to action movies, the main thing to expect is some big budget action sequences, explosive special effects, and some eye-popping stuntwork. These tropes are thoroughly demonstrated in this exciting early 90s action thriller directed by Kathryn Bigelow. Keanu Reeves plays Johnny Utah, a former Ohio State University star quarterback recruited as an undercover cop by the Los Angeles Police Department in the Pacific Coast. He and his partner Pappas (played by Gary Busey) are assigned by their hard-nosed boss Ben Harp (played by John McGinley) a case to capture a gang of long-time bank robbers. Suspecting these bank robbers are local surfers, Johnny gets drawn into the breezy lifestyle of surfing by local surfer Bohdi (played by Patrick Swayze) and his lover Tyler (played by Lori Petty). In attempt to catch these criminals, he uses his surfing expertise to infiltrate the gang and bring them to justice. This movie delivers quite the thrills and excitement at a wide scope action fans should expect from the film boasting such originality. Blossoming from a soulful screenplay and irresistibly hyper kinetic stunt work, this film brings on some amazing action sequences and thrills to grab your attention and never let go. Ranging from bloody gunfights, to the intense bank heists by vicious criminal sporting masks of President Reagan, to some wild skydiving established with nifty cinematography; there is almost too much to name. And there is also Keanu Reeves showing off some amazing surfing skills along the supporting cast in the scenes set on the beach. This movie is just filled with action and thrills many could easily consider groundbreaking, especially for the time of its release. Keanu Reeves is fantastic in the main role, and really puts forth the effort in portraying the main character with such energy and appeal. Patrick Swayze is quite outstanding in his role as well, showing off utter charisma. Supporting these decently developed characters and stunning action sequences is the sharply written plot. With the main theme of the story dealing with choosing between friendship and the power of the law enforcement, what comes from this is a compelling plot, and it works great. It succeeds on its effort of combining surfing with elements of crime and action, and mixing them into a solid, if flawed smorgasbord of excitement.Point Break is a prime example of a 90s action film done right, and a movie that is high recommendation for action fans everywhere. It is certainty the best of Kathryn Bigelow's early works and shows Keanu Reeves in arguably his best role during his pre-Matrix years. If you are up with an exciting popcorn action flick, this would make a good pick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Point Break is legendary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have loved this film since the first time I saw it in '91. The action is terrific, the actors are great together, the soundtrack is excellent &amp; the storyline ties it all together beautifully. All together, it makes for a fantastic movie experience. For me, there's an indescribable ambiance that the movie creates, when i watch it. I become invested in each one of the characters. I appreciate how Johnny &amp; Papas develop a close "father &amp; son-ish" relationship. Both are a little ornery w sarcastic personalities. Bodhi &amp; his crew are a very close-nit group, too. They aren't really violent individuals, at heart (minus Rosie), but they will project violence in order to make money so they can continue living the adventurous, care-free lifestyles that they love &amp; have grown accustomed to, via surfing, skydiving, etc. It's without question, one of my Top 10 fav flicks of all-time. The creators of the 2015 Point Breakshould be ashamed of themselves. They didn't come anywhere close to the quality of the "real" Point Break. I actually find it offensive that they thought they could create a present-day Point Break that would even be in the same galaxy as the original. If u haven't seen Point Break '91, then u have deprived yourself of a awesome movie. Go rent it or buy it...u can find it on blu-ray, these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze's best Action Heist film of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Point Break (1991) is one of my favorite Keanu Reeves Action heist movie of all time! I love this movie to death! Beside The Matrix which I went to see in Theater in 1999 when it was out and Speed is my third favorite best movie! The action sequences are awesome and the adrenaline rush of the surfing and extreme junks including shootouts are outstanding! Provides fast and loose action with interesting characters. Great action movie!!!! One of the best for me!!!!!!!!! To this day this movie stands a classic action heist movie of all time! Acting, story, score everything in here is excellent! This movie is getting a remake this year a month from now and all I can say is why remake this movie?! That is just plain stupid to get more money. They are going to mess it up and ruined! This movie really doesn't need a remake. Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze star in this nonstop action thriller about an FBI agent lured by the rush when he goes undercover to unmask a band of thrill-seeking surfers who rob banks to fund their addiction to pulling off the most daring score, surviving the greatest danger and riding the biggest wave--Point Break. That is your basic plot of the movie, the first time I saw I was completely blown away, you have adrenaline rush about an Action junkies, who doesn't find it only on a few adrenalins they go from surfing to the extreme sports skydiving to a bank robbery. I think this movie did not just become a stand up alone action movie it also inspired several movies in a cop style going undercover in a gang of extremist adrenaline junkies. Like movies Drop Zone (1994) also Gary Busey started in that movie in the opposite role of Wesley Snipes, this time the bad guy in here he played Angelo Pappas Special Agent FBI and partner of Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves), The Fast and The Furious (2001), TV Movie Cutaway (2000) and Riders (2002) those are the movies I can think off. This movie is awesome it has everything you want from a summer blockbuster movie, it got cops, robbers, action, pretty girls, bank heist, car chases, foot chases, surfing and skydiving. And all that comes in one movie, 24 years following this year film's release, has proved how it has stood the test of time, and 20.years from now it will still be doing the same. For a female filmmaker Kathryn Bigelow has really created a very testosterone's filed and astonish feature film. She really bounces an adrenalin fuelled bank heist, with breath taking scenes of water and surfing. Than top of the she captured with all inspiring skydiving here and there. In my opinion this is Kathryn Bigelow's best movie that she ever directed beside Zero Dark Thirty (2012) is my first favorite film of hers Zero dark thirty is the second. Kathryn Bigelow did perfectly and outstanding directed this action movie that I love so much. The cast was a perfect choose for a perfect movie. Point Break is actually a film that I grew up with it and it was my favorite movie in my teen years. That 90s theme was so cool and perfect, the music score Nobody Rides for Free by Ratt was the best and a perfect song for a perfect action movie! Patrick Swayze did outstanding job as Bodhi, he gave us the best acting performance, I ever saw! He was awesome in this movie, as Bodhy he is a bad ass, dude is awesome. RIP Patrick Swayze 1952-2009&#xfeff;. Keanu Reeves did the best performance ever, beside The Matrix and Constantine he did the best acting performance ever as Special FBI Agent Johnny Utah. The all aspect of the surfing is all true in this movie, specially when Keanu cut's a mans hair it was all true.Watch the other actors surrounding him in Point Break, Keanu just has more charisma and more chops than most of them in the movie. Looking back at Point Break, its easy to underestimate his unique appeal and talent. Its no wonder this guy keeps on getting work. I love Keanu and his movie so much. The acting in this movie is great as hell but is very fun, the action great I love it no CGI, everything seems practical. The skydive scene is probably the most iconic of this movie. You can't ask for better directed movie, decent acted movie, but awesome action movie! It is one of the best 1991 movies probably the second of Terminator: Judgment Day (1991) I am no really certainly of all 1991 movies , besides these two so far. Point Break is a 1991 American action crime thriller directed by Kathryn Bigelow, starring Patrick Swayze, Keanu Reeves, Lori Petty and Gary Busey. I am giving this movie 10/10 because the film deserves it. I love it to death and it is one of my favorite Keanu Reeves movies!10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: 20TH Century Fox Starring: Patrick Swayze, Keanu Reeves, Gary Busey, Lori Petty, John C.

		<shortDescription>Good direction ill-served by poor acting and terrible script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The summary says it all from my point of view, but a minimum of ten lines are required so .... Director Kathryn Bigelow does have her moments during this film, using a visual style that comes close to that of her sadly under-appreciated earlier vampire flick "Near Dark" (1987). Unfortunately, the acting load is carried (or not) by three hams and a twinkie: Patrick Swayze, Keanu Reeves, Gary Busey, and Lori Petty. It's notable that the performance of the usually comically bad Swayze actually looks good in this film when compared to the others. The screenplay of W. Peter Iliff is horrendous. I notice that several commenters thought the film to be at least in part a satire, but I didn't get that impression. I think the script is just so awful it becomes unintentionally laughable. I must confess that I am at a loss to understand the rave reviews many have given this film, but it would be a very boring world if everyone had the same taste. Rating: 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like nonsense, this is the film for you. It was visually OK, what with the surfing scenes and skydiving scenes, but the premise was a bit of a stretch.I'm not sure I quite caught on as to why the character played by Gary Busey suspected that the perpetrators were surfers. Because of a bit of wax left by a footprint? Surfers don't usually wear their shoes when they stand on their boards. There could have been any number of reasons for the mixture of this wax and sand on the shoes.It was amazing how the character played by Keanu Reeves was able to sky-dive like a pro, free-falling and all, without any training in the art. I've been given to understand that one has to make several jumps before free-falling.As far as someone jumping out of an airplane without a chute? Yeah, right. And with the delay between the time that Patrick Swayze departs the aircraft and Keannu Reeves follows, he would have needed a serious case of gas to catch up to him.I can't even buy a King Air being used as a jump plane.The ending was not plausible either, and the final scene is stolen right out of 'Dirty Harry'.A pleasant watch, if you can manage the suspension of disbelief.I couldn't.</fullReview>

Swayze isn't much more believable as the zenmaster/bankrobber/surfin'-guru. Add an over-wrought soundtrack, over-the-top action sequences (I fear this movie may be singlehandedly responsible for the sport of sky-surfing), and dialog straigt out of "Nietzsche for Dummies", and you have the makings of an evening with Joe Bob Briggs.

		<fullReview>This is my first movie review on IMDb for a very big reason- I cannot recommend against this film enough. In my mind, the only reason this gets 1 star is that Patrick Swayze fits the "surfer dude" mentality very well (and that it ended).Unfortunately, there are no other positives.This is probably one of the worst, if not THE worst, acted film of all time (it doesn't try to be, either, thus making it worse)- and the actors just don't get any help from the screenplay. There is a young Keanu Reeves, a Special Agent, who goes undercover with surfing bank robbers, and delivers such crucial lines to the villain as "You crossed the line. People trusted you and they died. You gotta' go down." There is Patrick Swayze, the villain surfer dude who dresses up like a president to rob banks for the fun of it, who finds out there's a cop in his crew. What does he do? He takes him skydiving! Let's not kill him, hold him hostage, or even run to another city, guys, let's take him on a grand adventure he'll never forget! Maybe he'll forget to turn us in! There is Gary Busey (but don't get your hopes up) as an angry old cop, especially when he punches a fellow cop in the head because he "didn't respect his elders" in any of his three lines the whole movie.And best of all, there is a passionate ending scene in the pouring rain, as Special Agent Johnny Utah approaches Bodhi, the person he once, kind of considered a friend, and Bodhi announces "Special Agent Utah, I knew I could count on you!" Touching, considering the relationship between them in the entire movie consisted of either Bodhi crashing Utah's sleep to take him somewhere, or the two of them pointing a gun at each other. Yes, Patrick Swayze, you really did count on him.Other than the major actors, there's a guy who proudly announces that he hopes to "not live past 30" yet seems to forget this when he actually begins to die. And Tyler Endicott, who falls for Johnny Utah, apparently just disregards that he lied (pretty much from the moment they first meet) in order to solely use her to get to her ex-boyfriend.The bottom line is- there are plenty of movies that focus on undercover cops, action, love, and even surfing out there. Please get one of them, because should you choose "Point Break", the rest of your day will be in deep anger over why you saw this movie. Please, heed my warning, and watch something- anything else.</fullReview>

This movie had a rating from 7.9 before the remake, and now it has drained.Now ,to get back to our movie here... It is a shame there was no sequel, because there was planning for one, but they just didn't, because they had to pick between this or the fast and the furious....

The difference is that he's going undercover into the surfing world. It gets into the territorial nature of surfing and some darker side. There are some good action. The surfing action could be better but I really like foot chase. It has a great frantic energy. The acting is so great. Both Reeves and Swayze fit their roles.

		<shortDescription>A popular 90's cult classic that is still enjoyable today.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Point Break is one of those action movies that is still popular amongst a lot of audiences yet a lot of people will secretly admit they like the movie. Point Break was a box office hit in 1991 and with Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves in the lead roles, along with cracking action scenes and spectacular adrenaline fueled cinematography, it's not hard to see why this film had the correct formula to still maintain its popularity years later.Keanu Reeves plays a former college football player turned rookie FBI Agent Johnny Utah who has been assigned to the Los Angeles Field Office where he is investigating a string of bank robberies by four men dressed as the Ex-Presidents (Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Lyndon Baines Johnson, and Ronald Regan). Utah's partner, Vietnam Veteran and experienced FBI agent Angelo Pappas (Gary Busey) comes up with the radical theory that the Ex-Presidents are actually surfers. Johnny Utah finds himself going deep undercover into the Southern California surf culture despite having zero experience as a surfer, much to the chagrin of Utah and Pappas' boss, the hard nosed and angry Ben Harp (John C. McGinley). Utah manages to enlist the reluctant Tyler (Lori Perry) to teach Utah to surf and Utah finds himself accepted into a group of surfers led by the charismatic and philosophical Bodhi (the late Patrick Swayze). As Utah masters the art of surfing, Utah finds himself increasingly drawn to Bodhi's adrenaline charged lifestyle as well being accepted into the surfing culture, and finds himself attracted to Tyler. The line becomes blurred when Utah's suspicions about Bodhi increase that him and his surfing buddies are actually the Ex-Presidents, the gang responsible for the string of bank robberies across Southern California.Patrick Swayze was a huge box office drawcard from the 80's and early 90's riding high from the success of such movies as Dirty Dancing (1987), Road House (1989) and Ghost (1990). As Bodhi in Point Break, he oozes charisma and charm yet he has a wild streak about him going up against the system.Keanu Reeves as rookie FBI agent Johnny Utah comes across as a grown up jock at first but you can't help but like him in his first action role he later becomes famous for with movies such as Speed (1994) and The Matrix (1999).Gary Busey has a reputation as an eccentric personality on and away from the cameras as well as garnering a well known reputation as the bad guy with movies such as Lethal Weapon (1987) and Under Siege (1992). Here in Point Break as Angelo Pappas, he is actually great as the good guy and strikes a strong friendship with Johnny Utah despite their contrasting personalities.Lori Petty as surfer chick Tyler who falls in love with Utah actually gained notice from a lot of audiences. She continued to gain notice with A League of Their Own (1992) and Free Willy (1993), however her star appeal dwindled with the box office flop Tank Girl (1995). Unfortunately she hasn't really been heard from since.Kathryn Bigalow gained a reputation as the first female director to direct an action blockbuster and further bucked the trend to be the first female director to win an Academy Award for The Hurt Locker (2008), and full credit to her. Kathryn Bigalow has earned her reputation as a quality director.What is there to like about Point Break? To sum it up, you have the star power of likable actors Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves, Gary Busey as a sane good guy, breathtaking cinematography, exciting action, and for lovers of surfing, there is plenty of it. There is also no way I cannot leave out the skydiving scene where Bodhi and his friends surprise Johnny Utah with an early morning skydive. One of the most amazing scenes in the movie along with Mark Isham's score makes it something that will not soon be forgotten.I can't believe that a remake of Point Break is being released at the end of 2015. This time we now have Luke Bracey as Johnny Utah, Edgar Ramirez as Bodhi, Ray Winstone as Angelo Pappas, and Teresa Palmer as the female lead. Also the surfing culture has been substituted for extreme sports. I have seen the trailer to the 2015 remake and already I don't think it will hold a candle to the 1991 classic. Please Hollywood, enough of the remakes and preserve the memory of the original classics.That brief point aside, Point Break lives up to its tagline: 100% pure adrenaline. It is definitely one of those movies that made the 90's so great. There's no denying that Point Break is still a popular cult classic that is still enjoyable today.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Early-90's Action Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I almost forgot what a pretty boy Keanu Reeves used to be.On the most superficial level, this movie is just your basic 90's action cop-thriller, this time with surfers and skydivers.It's a bit dated but still charming at this point, like something Key and Peele would spoof on their sketch comedy show. Keanu Reeves' acting is a bit uneven, often good, but other times cheesy and laughable. Patrick Swayze in particular was perfectly cast, he really inhabits the role of the legendary Bodhi, god rest his soul.But the movie does have a touch of depth to it: There are themes of brotherhood, bonds between men, the romance of masculinity, a bit like Fight Club. It's kind of homo-erotic to be honest, with all the lingering shots of tight, toned, tanned male bodies frolicking in the ocean, but there ain't nothing' wrong with that.The movie also touches on the symbolism of the ocean, the unfathomable mysteries of the spirit, the conflict between mind and body, between order and chaos, parallels the conflict between the police and the surfers.So, if you are thinking of watching this movie, it's good enough, give it a shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surf's Up Ace!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kathryn Bigelow was a different director back in 1991. Before the success of The Hurt Locker (2009) and Zero Dark Thirty (2012), she was making films that weren't deemed Academy Award worthy. She was cutting her teeth with raw unflinching action flicks like Blue Steel (1989) and this screw loose guilty pleasure known as Point Break. I've seen it many times and honestly it just never gets old. It belongs in a time capsule. Point Break represents a lot of beliefs I have about the possibility of what an action film can be because it goes completely over the top and throws everything in it but the kitchen sink. Yes, it's a movie that is choppy in shape and form. But it has bombastic originality along with a handful of important jaw dropping key scenes that make up for its shortcomings. Initially, when I first set foot in the theater over 20 years ago for my first screening of Point Break, I was dumbfounded. I was completely taken aback by the casting (Keanu Reeves, Gary Busey, Patrick Swayze), the plot, and the fact that the initial viewing left me cold, like I had seen a film that an average audience would stay away from (the theater was small, it was Friday night, and there were 8-10 people in the seats). Over time, I've grown to surrender to Point Break's giddiness as full blown cinema. It stands the test of time and breaks every film making rule in the book. You think the director, the stars, or the production staff cared, well they didn't. I have one word for these people, bravo!The story begins with our hero, Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves in a his first starring action film role) entering his first day as a FBI agent in sunny Los Angeles. Right away, he gets paired with an over the hill aging veteran named Angelo Papas (played with improv overload by the likable Gary Busey). The two of them team up to try and catch a group of bank robbers who may or may not be surfers. Oh and I almost forgot, they also dress up as the ex-presidents with masks and all, only taking money out of the cash registers (apparently the vault takes too much time). Throughout the full running time of two pulse pounding hours, Reeves character befriends a local named Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) and romances a spunky surfer girl Tyler Endicott (Lori Petty) all the while going undercover and bruising his "whoooaaa" like ego in the process. I'm not gonna lie, his performance demands attention. As a actor, he tends to be as wooden as aged oak but he's likable in "Break." Bigelow saw something in Reeves that I think most directors would have dismissed as a veritable disaster. But she gave him his shot and he went on to shine later in Speed and the Matrix movies. Also, the pairing of Busey and Reeves as law enforcement associates is something I initially thought was some kind of nocturnal joke, but it works. Busey, with his purely white fanged teeth, runs amok with this character and becomes Utah's scary, perverse uncle. As the movie takes a lot of trippy twists and turns, the two of them form a friendship based on polar opposite attraction. It's the key to the film I think because ultimately it's a buddy cop yarn just like Lethal Weapon (1987) and 48 Hours (1982).Buddy cops movies aside, Point Break is pure adrenaline and has a harrowing intensity that shows in three key scenes: the sting operation of a drug house followed by mistaken identity, the skydiving scene with no parachutes, and the apprehension of the villain in Austrailia's nastiest waters. I can say that a cult following this flick garnished, is well deserved. Kathyrn Bigelow, a maverick back then and an Academy darling now, deserves praise for this early 90's endeavor. She directed Point Break with reckless abandon and I'm proud to say it owns a special place in my eccentric collection of well worn DVDs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's an ultra cool movie, I watched Saturday arvo. I hadn't seen it for a few years. I just can't help lovin' this film, every time I see it. It jumps straight into the story. Four bank robbers, going under alias's, their team name, the ex-presidents, (so you obviously know what names they go by) have successfully robbed these L.A. over summer spells, yet to be caught, until one of them brags too much, mooning a camera. Burned up FBI agent, Busey, has a notion these guys could be surfers. New hot shot, Johnny Utah, (Keanu Reeves) is partnered with him, who at first too, thinks his notions bologne. Reeves goes undercover as a surfer, and it isn't long before he's all buddy buddy with an truly devoted and poetic surfer, Bodhi, the ultimate thrill seeker. He's the head of this group who could be our guys, while getting on the wrong side of another group, an angry and scary looking group of drug frenzied surfers, neo nazi sorts, also suspects. Reeves can be forgiven for his acting here, you just love him as this cool cat character, putting a bit of Bill and Ted into it, especially in the finale scene, cool and classically memorable. Bodhi's ex girlfriend, Tyler (Lori Petty at her sexiest) is the more sensible one, who Reeves strikes up sexual relationship with. The movie never dulls, Reeves and Busey, a great duo, and I loved the ever great, John C (Platoon) McGinley as their captain where an anger management course wouldn't go astray. Too, watch out for Tom Sizemore in a grand moment, who's undercover operation is blown apart, on the account of this wrong and flimsy hunch. Some great and sufficient chase sequences, too, make it an action winner. The movie even makes parachuting look fun, and you gotta admire Keanu's steely determination when jumping out a plane, minus a chute. Check out the start of the last scene at Bells Beach, featuring a four second shot of Aussie, Peter Phelps. Too, check out the screenplay which is an awesome read, by an awesome writer who has some dialogue you'd kill for, one such line spouted by Bodhi, embedded in my mind, forever. Only criticism really, was the bad guys being revealed too early.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Effective is the adjective that perhaps describes the best Point Break.The script isn't very original nor innovative but it holds water, though you could criticize the fact that it is too predictable and the lack of depth regarding the characters. The rhythm is relatively sustained but there are a few overlong passages that weigh the overall dynamism; in this sense, a 15 minute cut would have been beneficial.The direction is a success, polished, especially the surf scenes that render really well.Nothing to complain about the cast, of course it is not very subtle but the Swayze-Reeves duo works pretty well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the terms of its concept alone, "Point Break" sounds farcical. When the bad guys aren't waving around revolvers and yelling at bank tellers, they're riding waves, playing night football on the beach . . . and going skydiving. And during quieter moments, Patrick Swayze waxes philosophically about the energy of the ocean, and the ego-checking Mother Earth likes to dole out when we get too full of ourselves. And Keanu Reeves is the FBI agent out to bust them. And his name is Johnny Utah. You can't make this stuff up, but someone did(!) and that's what makes it so fun. The movie plays this nonsense completely straight and it all comes together surprisingly (criminally?) well. And it's a pretty damn good action movie, which is icing on the cake. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's hard to say exactly WHY I liked this, but I really did.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, let me say that this movie was made before I was born, I had never even heard of it until recently, and only saw it because I've been going through and watching a lot of Keanu Reeves' movies. So my take on it is fresh: there's no nostalgia or memories associated with this movie for me, unlike many of the reviews I've seen.When Special Agent Johnny Utah goes undercover trying to root out a group of bank robbers who are also surfers in California, he has no idea how deep he will get sucked in, nor how fast. The surfers are adrenaline junkies who just look for the next thrill in life, but they don't see themselves as criminals, or as slackers, but instead as a dying breed, free spirits, the only human beings that are truly living. First confused, then fascinated by their thinking, Johnny walks a fine and treacherous line. Will he stand firm and take down these men whose philosophy is misguided, criminal, yet strangely seductive? The premise does sound almost laughable. I mean, the FBI inserts a special agent (named JOHNNY UTAH)to work undercover by hanging out with a gang of surfers. Who they suspect are really a gang of bank robbers that wear masks with the faces of US Presidents on them. Yet somehow, it worked. Much of the credit for this goes to Keanu Reeves (love him or hate him, he was perfect here). Gary Busey and Patrick Swayze were also phenomenal. Kudos as well to Katherine Bigelow, and everybody else who helped direct/produce this movie: they took a campy, impossible premise, and turned it into a movie I won't be forgetting anytime soon.Sure, there are a few clunkers. Several lines fall flat, a few scenes are difficult to swallow even for an action movie fan. There are a few plot holes, and one or two baffling decisions made by the characters. But with big waves, good performances, and a driven pace, this movie sucks you in anyway. I would recommend it to any lover of the genre. It's something fresh, not CG dominated, explosions and superheroes. Take it for what it's worth, and enjoy it.I dislike the fact that 'free-spirited' Bodhi is glorified...his 'freedom' was just living for the thrill, not caring who and what he destroyed along the way. He was incredibly selfish, but such a charismatic person that others followed him anyway. Maybe that's why I like Johnny Utah so much. He was a hotshot who wanted the same things as Bodhi did: excitement, lust for life, beauty. But when he could so easily have been seduced down the road that destroyed Bodhi, instead he stood up for what he knew was right.In summary: Point Break just rocks as an action thriller with a bizarre plot that works against all odds, and in spite of frequent campiness. Take it for surface value, a you get a splashy, fun, thrilling movie. Look a little deeper, and you see a powerful movie, and one character who stays true to himself without sacrificing his honor, integrity, and what he knows is right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze go all 'surfer' on us in this rather good thriller from Kathryn Bigelow?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another film I've seen a few times before but one that never really stuck in the memory banks. Time for a refresher? You betcha! Another one shown on TV and so it was a case of set the recorder and await a suitable window for a viewing. As you can probably guess, that window opened up this evening (despite the best efforts of the weather and the gods of sod's law to prevent it!). I must say, for the most part I enjoyed it, although I did find it tended to drag a bit towards the end. More of my thoughts after this brief summary.Rookie FBI agent Johnny Utah gets assigned to investigate bank robberies in California with veteran, Pappas. Their boss, Ben Harp, is less than impressed with the pair but assigns them to the 'Ex-Presidents' case. A series of robberies where the perpetrators all wear rubber masks with the faces of ex-Presidents of the United States. Pappas has a theory that the men behind it are surfers and so Utah goes undercover in an effort to find them. He first meets Tyler, a girl, who teaches him to surf and eventually becomes his girlfriend. She introduces him to the surfing culture and a group of her friends led by the charismatic adrenaline junkie, Bodhi. Utah comes to respect Bodhi while constantly on the look-out for the ex-presidents. When one line of enquiry fails to pay off he begins to come to a realisation? I will leave it there or the Spoiler Police (Surfing Division) will confiscate my board (again).The cinematography in this film is great! Not just the surfing scenes; there's skydiving and a great chase sequence around the back yards of some houses that I really enjoyed. The performances were all good, although I did still see Keanu Reeves, who plays Johnny Utah, as his character in the 'Bill and Ted' films from his younger days. If he had been a couple of years older then I think he may have been a little more believable. Patrick Swayze, on the other hand, as Bodhi, was perfect for the part (IMO). Honourable mentions must also go to; Gary Busey, larger than life (as ever) as Pappas, Lori Petty as Tyler and John C. McGinley as Ben Harp.I like the plot of this film, but it does take a little time to get going at the beginning and, as I've already mentioned, it does seem to drag a bit at the end. I do like the way all the main characters are well rounded and we get to know a little about their back stories. This does help when we are supposed to care about them. Over all, I pretty much enjoyed this one and I'm quite happy to deem it recommended.My score: 7.4/10.IMDb Score: 6.9/10 (based on 48,620 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 67/100 (based on 52 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 47/100 (based on 114,764 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive cheesy 90s film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Point Break" might just be one of the most soothing movies ever made. Every single frame of this film pats you on the back and tells you everything will be alright. Sure, there's a lot of violence and murder throughout, but that all comes of as pretty mild when it's laced with Patrick Swayze spouting utterly meaningless monologues about the spirituality of surfing. His character's name is "Bodhi" for God's sake, that has to make you curious. You know your character is bizarre when it makes Gary Busey look semi-balanced. The action scenes stand out as very well-done, particularly the endless foot chase you get somewhere around the middle. Just minutes and minutes of running through back yards, jumping over fences, knocking people over, damn it why don't they make 'em like this anymore? Same with the bank robbery, the filming is so basic and therefor so much fun. And the ending, nothing could prepare you for its cheesiness but it's pretty touching nonetheless. "Point Break" is a classic, hate it or love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High-energy "Point Break" is messy but damn fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the courts of cinema, "Point Break" stands as Exhibit A for the case that a movie doesn't necessarily have to make sense to be a good time. Kathryn Bigelow's surfer crime actioner is a pure adrenaline film not unlike the sport it portrays. Not all the components add up at times, but it offers high stakes action nonetheless.Keanu Reeves stars as Johnny Utah, a former star quarterback at Ohio State who's become an FBI agent and must learn to surf in order to test his partner Pappas' (Gary Busey) theory that Los Angeles' infamous "Ex-Presidents," a group of bank robbers, are a bunch of beach bums. Washed-up quarterback, law enforcer and surfer dude ? it doesn't get any more Keanu Reeves than that.Johnny convinces a local surfer girl named Tyler (Lori Petty) to teach him the ropes and from there he meets surf guru Bodhi (Patrick Swayze), a man of a particular life philosophy, one that of course butts heads a bit with the law but not in a malevolent sense. Of course Johnny ends up falling for Tyler and gets a bit too buddy-buddy with Bodhi and his loyalties to the FBI get a bit muddled.The trouble with understanding what's going on is we're never quite on the same page with what's in Johnny's head. His motivation and ultimate goal appears to be enforcing the law and proving himself to his jerk boss (John C. McGinley), but his character gets carelessly wrapped up in the surfer life and there are some logic flaws with his actions. His ongoing choice throughout the film to either bring Bodhi down or let him be never totally registers from a logic standpoint.Despite the entertainment value, entire scenes in "Point Break" have no bearing on what's going on. At one point Johnny goes skydiving with the surfer friends who we know at this point are the Ex-Presidents, who in turn know that Johnny's a fed. Yet we get this skydiving sequence which must've been a lot of fun to shoot, but diverges a bit too much.Yet no matter how aimless a route the film takes to gets there, all the major action sequences pack a punch and keep you on the edge of your seat. Bigelow gives extra weight to the action and just when you think you have the sequence figured out, something changes it completely.The only thing that the movie does poorly would be overvaluing the love story, which ends up playing a pivotal role in the final act of the film when it has little bearing on our enjoyment of the rest of the film. It's a very '80s love subplot in that sense. The film could really do without&nbsp;Tyler, as mean as that might seem.But Tyler doesn't detract from the truly fun parts of the film, which ought to make any pure action junkie's list of '90s classics. The unique combination of that California living out on the waves with a bank-robbing crime thriller certainly makes "Point Break" one of the action genre's most memorable and some ballsy action scenes make it nearly unforgettable.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies featuring Patrick Swayze. Though he is good he is certainly backed up quite nicely by Keanu Reaves and everyone's favorite crazy dude Gary Busey. The story has a bunch of bank robbers hitting banks wearing masks of ex-presidents. They are very successful and are causing the FBI a lot of grief. Well one agent has a theory that the guys robbing banks are a bunch of surfer dudes. This agent (Busey) recruits a new agent (Reaves) to pose as a surfer and see if he can penetrate the surfing culture and perhaps even find the guys responsible for the bank robberies. He has a rough go his first time on the waves and gets chewed out for being stupid by a cute surfer girl, but in the end he ends up becoming friends with this gang of surfers. Well you will probably know where this is going as they end up being the ones hitting the banks and thus there are some rather cool action scenes here and there. Though do not get me wrong, this is not a bang bang wall to wall action kind of movie. A lot of drama in this one too, but it works out nicely. Some really good scenes near the end too as there is a very nice airplane scene and I enjoyed the ending as well. Swayze does a very good job as the leader of the surfing dudes and proves to be a memorable character to watch. Like I said this is one of my favorite movies of his.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swayze and Reeves together again - action with a difference</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Awesome thrill-ride of a film. I don't know whether it's because this is directed by a woman (Bigelow) but it plays out differently to a lot of other action films; it's got more plot, emotion and variety to most, the characters are portrayed as fuller more rounded figures, and certainly in this you aren't sure whether the bad guys are as "bad" as all that. The lines are hazy, and this is the crux of the plot, and Bodhi (Swayze) is such a charismatic character, in life as on film, and Swayze was born to play this role - he is perfect, and plays the right mix of sensei idealist and slightly bonkers fanatic beautifully.It is one of my top ten films of all time, it having Patrick Swayze AND Keanu Reeves has something to do with it (a lot) but it's just such a rip-roaring ride, and has some epic scenes - the first sky-dive scene is almost ballet! The surfing is great too, and there are some lovely artist wave riding scenes. It's realistic, not overly stylised, and it isn't all "Hollywood." It's original and much copied (Fast and Furious is almost identical) and I don't understand why it didn't do better in terms of awards and recognition.Point Break is a step away character-wise for Reeves, and was apparently a risk for Bigelow casting him as action-man and from the opening scene of "100% Utah!" he's action all the way and he does it well with a physicality that impresses. He's a perfect 'partner' for Swayze who was always known for his physical prowess, and the chemistry between them seems really genuine. John C McGinley is awesome as Ben Harp, the Captain, and as in Scrubs does some incredible monologues at speed, vein throbbing in his head. Hilarious. The interaction between him, Utah and Pappas (Busey in a great role) is the comic relief. Lori Petty (Tank Girl) is well cast in this. She works well with Reeves and makes for fluid interlude between the action/cop shots, weaving in and out of the story as part of the central theme but also outside of it.The writing is flawless, and all the primary actors bring it to life cleanly. Some great quotable lines in this, my personal favourite being, "Utah, you're about to jump out of a perfectly good aeroplane, how d'you feel about that?" This is a cult classic and rightly so - one of the best movies of the early 90s. The only reason not to like this film is if your film watching sensibilities don't extend to nudity, bad language and violence; the worst of it in the one scene in the middle where the stake-out "goes down." You can fast forward that bit but you'll love the rest, I'm sure of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seriously seen this film over 20 times and it is just plain and simple, fun. From the script to the action pieces, everything just seems perfect. If an audience today watches the film, there are a few places where they laugh that I don't think were intended to be laughed at, originally. While this may seem sad, it's actually an amazing thing that keeps the film fresh, Even here in LA they have a play based on the film and at first glance they seem to be making fun of it but really... they are just paying homage to it. They truly understand and appreciate a film being such great and fun thrill ride.Anyway, no matter your age, you can really enjoy this film.

		<shortDescription>White Knuckled Fever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before extreme sports movies such as "xXx," "Extreme Ops," and "Steal" came out, Academy Award winning "Hurt Locker" director Kathryn Bigelow helmed the equivalent years ahead of their time. "Point Break" concerns a fearless FBI rookie agent who infiltrates an audacious band of surfers who like to rob banks wearing latex masks of President Nixon, Carter, Johnson, and Reagan. These notorious bank robbers use the loot to finance their 'endless summer.' The rookie learns the basics about bank robbery from his mentor, Angelo Pappas, who has been investigating bank hold-ups for twenty-two years. Former Ohio State Buckeyes college football quarterback Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves of "The Matrix") blew out his knee so he got a legal degree and joined the FBI. Pappas admires this gang for several reasons. They don't shoot anybody. They don't take from the vault. They steal from the cash drawers on the counter. And they leave nothing in the way of clues. Nevertheless, he has a hunch that the robbers are surfers. Word is that "Ferris Bueller" star Matthew Broderick turned down the role and Reeves landed it. Reeves is physically fit enough to perform the hustling requirements. Basically, "Point Break" is a suspenseful, Spartan crime thriller that ripples with adrenaline-fueled action with bullets flying like hail. Reeves and Gary Busey make a good pair of FBI agents. Bigelow alternates between static expository scenes and scenes of white-knuckled action. The foot chase between Utah and the lead bank robber is visceral. Patrick Swayze makes a first-class villain who does his best to lure Utah to the dark side. He delivers the best performance of the film, with Lori Petty coming in close second. John C.

		<shortDescription>Bigelow's early masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>25-old Reeves plays a rookie FBI-agent Johnny Utah, a man/boy who has to decide whether to be one of the lads or to grow up and be his own man. After leaving his football team, Utah joins another team (FBI), but then finds an even better one (beach football playing, surfing, sky diving bank robbers). Reeves is surprisingly effective as a cocky young man growing up fast, with great performances from team mates/father figures played by Patrick Swayze, Gary Busey and John C. McGinley. Lori Petty plays Tyler, a tough but sensitive woman who forces Utah to grow up. A visually stunning film, filled with symbols and metaphors (watch out for the use of reflecting surfaces, e.g. Utah's reflection on a surfboard, fractured mirror after the drug house raid). All in all, an early masterpiece by Kathryn Bigelow, who rightfully won an Academy Award for Best Direction for Hurt Locker in 2010. Film theorists have written reams about this film, with at least a dozen different readings, but no matter which way you look at it, it stays with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action scenes and mind games to boot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kinda slow and stodgy at the start-up, where character development is needed, and there is some action involving a bank robbery by 4 people wearing ex-presidents mask, but overall, despite the surfing theme, it's a pretty good movie...even if you don't surf. Keanu Reeves is the young hotshot FBI agent fresh from Quantico, resented by most old timers who have long since given up on actually solving a crime - realizing the paperwork is the scariest thing about their jobs, not the criminals. Gary Busey plays a character saddled with the young FBI agent, and who is really aggravated by the pup's aggressive idealism...at first, but then, like all good buddy movies, they form a bond. Keanu goes undercover by getting a lead that the string of bank robberies has something to do with surfing, so he learns to surf in a really short montage. From there, there's one fantastic foot chase when the FBI agent sees one of the "ex-presidents" still wearing his mask, fresh from a bank robbery nearby. The foot chase is worth the price of admission by itself. It's really that good. Good Steadicam work, too. Next comes a strange bond the FBI agent forms with the leader of a surfing tribe of 4, with everyone in on every little secret the other person has and yet no one can reveal their hand next. Then comes the parachute scenes. One of them tops the foot chase scene as the FBI agent jumps out of a perfectly good plane with nothing but a hope and a prayer (and a handgun) continuing his chase of the head of the ex-presidents. Reeves, Busey and Patrick Swayze are excellent in their roles. Oscar Winner Kathryn Bigelow directed this winner and her then husband, James Cameron produced it. Watch it just for the scene where the dog is thrown on someone if for nothing else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this certainly isn't one of those technical, arty, complicated "masterpiece" films- no arguments from me there. what it IS is a very good and enjoyable action film. you watch it, you enjoy it, and (unlike action films made in the 2000s) you don't feel as if you are having your intelligence insulted while watching it (eg the Fast &amp; the Furious series and numerous others). sure, the skydiving scenes have been busted by the Mythbusters (iv been skydiving myself and that scene is still at least watchable), and I'm sure there are more goofs in the film; but none of them are particularly obvious. the plot is simple but not idiotic, and its a movie that you can associate with the good times of summer. i ask you- don't u wish they made action films like this nowadays?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's flipping great because I got what I expected from it, dumb unadulterated fun, jam packed with action and some tremendous thrilling sequences. When you lay out director Kathryn Bigelow's CV it arguably doesn't add up to much, but there are so many great things to be taken from each one of her movies. Her work here is excellent, from the sumptuous surfing sequences to the breath taking aerial shoots, the film is technically sound in that respect. The acting is of course to the standard required for an adrenalin rush actioner such as this, and the plot, tho simple as it is, has enough about it to keep the viewer intrigued as to what the outcome will be. Personally I loved the finale, and find the soundtrack to be quite excellent {I'm always biased if I hear John Lydon in there}. While the locations further emphasise the tone and general feel of the film. So all in all the film delivers for those seeking a thrilling popcorn movie with absolutely no pretensions. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Point Break</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was keen to see Keanu Reeves in more action films, after the fantastic Speed, and of course before his success in The Matrix, and this was it. Basically a gang of professional bank robbers, calling themselves The Ex-Presidents, wearing masks of Presidents Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Lyndon B. Johnson and leader Ronald Reagan are still on the loose. Agent Angelo Pappas (Gary Busey) has found evidence that the men behind the masks are surfers, with sand and oil and stuff found, and it is up to his partner John 'Johnny' Utah (Reeves) to try and find them. The only way he can do this is by becoming a surfer himself, and fit into the crowd, so he gets some training from Tyler Ann Endicott (Lori Petty). She introduces him to Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) ans his group of surfer friends, Roach (James LeGros), Grommet (Bojesse Christopher), and Nathaniel (John Philbin). Obviously because he seems to be spending a little more time surfing and socialising, the FBI, especially boss Ben Harp (Scrubs' John C. McGinley), are concerned he is not trying to find The Ex-Presidents. It was pretty obvious to the viewing audience that Bodhi and his group were the criminals, and when they know Johnny is a cop, they are determined not just to pull a bigger job, but to get him caught in the act. I mainly heard of this film because of the mention and fantastic spoof featured in Hot Fuzz, when Reeves shoots in the air in anger at not catching the criminal leader. Reeves I guess isn't fantastic, and the story is a little silly at times, but when you have a good villain played by Swayze, and some very viewable surfing and sky-diving sequences, you can't go wrong. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you want the ultimate? Prove it! Jump out of a plane without a parachute! Pick a fight with a guy named War Child! Punch an angry dog in the face! Talk back to Gary Busey! What's that? Don't feel like it? Then you can't hang with Keanu, much less hang loose with Bodhi Swayze. It's true that Johnny "Keanu" Utah may be "young, dumb and full o' cum," but ask the other characters in the film and they will tell you that he's much more complex than that. He's got the "kamikaze look" and if you mess with him while he's taking a post-surf shower, he won't back down an inch ...and that is very rare in this world! And if you're a lawn mower, don't even bother trying to stare him down! You'll lose! But Johnny Utah is nothing compared to Patrick Swayze's Bodhi. Bodhi is a man of mystery. His past is as bleached as his hair, which means you don't know much about his past, except that he used to ride a Chevy that looked like a surf board. Point Break is NOT a movie! Point Break is a state of mind. It's where you lose yourself and you find yourself. RIP Patrick Swayze! Your cultural impact renders that of the president whose mask you wore to rob banks insignificant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>100% Pure Adrenaline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>15-foot Hawaiian waves are unabashedly intercut with California beaches. A footchase through Venice Beach neighborhoods defies endurance and fatigue, while a leap from a plane sans a parachute defies logic.But logic doesn't matter when adrenaline is pumping through your system. And that's precisely the point of Kathryn Bigelow's "Point Break," a movie that's just as exciting the 20th time you see it as the first.Some people might ridicule the fact that this film is so high on my list. Conceptually a "B" movie (FBI rookie infiltrates gang of surfer bank robbers), the film did moderately well at the box office and could easily have been dismissed as an action-thriller among the likes of "Lethal Weapon" or "Die Hard." But I have a hard time finding a movie that matches this film's serenity and luster, which ultimately defines the spell under which special agent Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) falls after meeting surfer Bodhi (Patrick Swayze).They say there's something about surfing unlike anything in the world. And there's a reason why people get up at 5am each day to hit the waves before the tourists show up. There's something magical about the ocean's power, something transcendent about reaching a harmony with its rhythms, which Bodhi describes as a "spiritual side" of it (that nazi surf punks like Anthony Kiedis fail to understand). Go watch "Endless Summer" and see men in their 50s abandoning careers and material possessions traveling the world in search of the perfect wave. This is what Utah is seduced by, a blend of adrenaline and total clarity that Bodhi embodies and by which he leads his minions into the "rush" of armed robbery. At several moments in the film, we too can imagine ourselves picking up a surfboard or jumping out of a plane, even if normally we'd consider ourselves too cowardly to do so."Point Break" features relentless stunt sequences arguably unmatched since its 1991 release-- and best of all, it mounts them one after another until its jaw-dropping climax. The raid on the meth house with a sequence involving a knife and lawnmower, the (already-mentioned) chase through Venice Beach including narrow alleyways and literally breaking through private residences, and a leap with no parachute out of a cessna over the Ensenada desert-- they're just highlights. Those don't even include the surf sequences, beginning at Leo Carrillo with Utah first learning how to pop up, on to the haunting final scene with Bodhi vanishing into a 70-footer on Bells Beach, Australia. Director Bigelow, who began her career as a painter, clearly places a high emphasis on visual appeal, rarely leaving a shot without some majesty to it. Meanwhile, in the context of California beach culture, Reeves and Swayze (and even Lori Petty) are perfectly cast, while Gary Busey has some of the best moments of his career as Utah's older, energetic partner Angelo Pappas.Universal Pictures essentially remade this movie for the post-millennium audience as "The Fast and the Furious," with Paul Walker in the Utah role and Vin Diesel in the Bodhi role. And that film was precisely what I mentioned earlier "Point Break" could've been-- an adequately entertaining action thriller among the likes of "Lethal Weapon" and "Die Hard." But street racing, while exciting, lacks the spellbinding serenity of surfing. Driving at speeds of 120mph can get you a rush, but there's no feeling of the earth, no spiritual harmony, no lucidity in one's existence.I was thirteen when this film was first released, in a summer when "Terminator 2" was all the rage among teenage boys. It wasn't until the next spring that I rented the movie on video, at which time my older cousin told me "I can't believe you didn't see this in the theater!" With the help of a big screen TV and surround sound, I began to understand what he meant. In many ways, this is a movie to be experienced like the very first action-thrillers, where audiences leapt into aisles to avoid being hit by trains charging at the screen. "Point Break" doesn't try to be profound or dramatic or anything else it's not. But it's far better than "Terminator 2" "Die Hard" or "Lethal Weapon" or any other cops-robbers movie that has been released in the last twenty years. Not until Zack Snyder's "300" (2006) was a non-Oscar-aspiring action film able to jolt adrenaline in viewers at a purely visceral level from its frenetic sensory experience."Point Break" is just that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One hundred percent pure adrenaline. "Point Break" has to one of the best action films of the early nineties and one of Keanu Reeves best films.Patrick Swaynze's also great in this film as well as Road House and many others. The film's got a lot to entertain: great story,characters,soundtrack,violence and ending. There's supposed to be sequel in the works for 2009 and if there is, Keanu has gotta be in it (Speed 2: Cruise Control was terrible with Jason Patric). Rating out of ten, 10. A very entertaining film that can be re-watched many a time and never be forgotten. If you miss out on this you'll regret it, great film.</fullReview>

The surfing footage is reasonable, the skydiving shots are rivalled only by those in "Terminal Velocity" but the thing that really sets this movie apart is not only the heady combination of sports but the inclusion of the Chilli Peppers and some awesome one-liners. What about "I just caught my first tube today...sir!" or "that would be a waste of time!"So if the Cessna's in for repair, the sea's flat and you lack funds get this puppy out, get your stick on your knee and wax up dudes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The odd thrill just about covers the dumb plot, `dude' acting and bad dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Utah is a hot new recruit to the robbery unit in LA FBI. He is partnered with Angelo Pappas who has spent several years on the track of a group of robbers called the Ex-Presidents. With their only lead being the belief that the gang are surfers. In an attempt to get into the culture sufficiently to find the gang, Utah takes up surfing as Pappas follows up other clues.Before both Speed and The Matrix had established Reeves as an action hero, he turned his slacker personae to this thriller for the x-generation. It is remembered with greater fondness that it deserves (probably due to the reputation that Reeves has since garnered) when really it is a pretty average film with a handful of good set pieces. These include sky diving scenes and a couple of slick bank robberies and they are quite enjoyable but, for me, not enough to cover the problems.These problems are unfortunate as they make up the spine of the film. First of all the whole plot is based on the assumption that you won't think about how much of it comes about as a result of coincidence, luck or just plot devices that make little or no sense. This fault starts in the first 5 minutes and continues right up till the end. The lazy writing can also be seen in a pretty average standard of dialogue. In fairness, most `dudes' tend to make me laugh anyway with their mock-stoned chatter, but occasionally it is laugh out loud absurd! However if you're in the mood for macho shouting then I guess it'll do it for you regardless.The cast is OK despite the fact that the characters are a bit silly and the actors just have to deal with it. Reeves is OK and he suits his character pretty well. I won't go into the sheer leaps of faith we have to make to believe his character, but his slightly wooden performance is OK in a film that is more about running and falling than acting. Swayze is far too spiritual and mystical about basically riding a piece of wood on a wave and I found him irritating rather than this inspiration guru that I was supposed to see. Petty is not great - she isn't pretty enough to do the love interest job and she is not given enough time to bond with Reeves - they have little chemistry. Busey is good in support in a rare good guy role and McGinley is good value.Overall this is a fairly average thriller but it will help if you are into surfing and that whole stoner culture. However even the most forgiving action head may struggle with a plot that treats the audience a bit like idiots, never expecting us to ask questions or to think about what we're seeing. OK, but there are many, many better thrillers out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, how we've been spoiled by Primetime cop shows like 'CSI'. Thanks to them, this movie can be declared "old". I watched this and 'Return of the King' in the same day because both movies create a "unique" story, but borrowing their individual elements from other movies.In the case of 'Point Break', you know its going to be dumb. Dumb story. DumbThis is your only spoiler warning...--For 'Point Break' it starts with the 'Terminator'-esque titles.--Liberal buddy material taken from 'Lethal Weapon': Busey as Glover, Keanu as Gibson.--The surfers are a mix of 'Empire Strikes Back', 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles', and 'Better Off Dead'.--Then it continues with a foot chase out of 'Ferris Bueller'.The orange photography of California sunset/sunrise doesn't work since everyone from 'Bad Boys' to 'Baywatch' has duplicated it for everything from Miami to Maui.The only strong element is the POV shots during the robberies and fights. Bigelow is effective in using them as both a narrative point and focus of character, furthered in 'Strange Days'. She just needs to push herself more like DePalma.The sad thing is how Hollywood remakes the story itself these days and not the individual elements. By comparison to 'Fast and Furious', this is sharp filmmaking.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easy on the brain actioner which works reasonably well if you're watching it in the right frame of mind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You need to have certain expectations before you start watching Point Break if you're going to enjoy it. Firstly, you need to believe that Keanu Reeves is a hotshot FBI agent in his mid twenties, which is hard to swallow since he still bears about him the look of goofy emptiness from the Bill and Ted days. Secondly, you need to accept that surfing is the most spiritual activity you can ever indulge in, and it has the power to change your life and turn you into an adrenalin junkie. If you can believe these two somewhat unlikely things, you'll be half way there in terms of being entertained.The story is pure action hokum, and it works well enough on the level of mind-blowing spectacle. Reeves penetrates a surfing gang who may be responsible for a series of bank robberies, and as it gradually dawns on him that they are indeed the culprits for whom he is searching he has to decide whether or not he can bring them to justice, having become a close friend of their spritual guru-like leader Patrick Swayze.The film benefits from spectacular moments, many of which are silly but all of which are enjoyable. The two big sky diving scenes are great, particularly the freefall pursuit near the end which seems to me to have been lifted rather suspiciously from the James Bond flick Moonraker. Other powerhouse moments include the gun battle on a house belonging to a gang of Nazi thugs, mistakenly thought to be the bank robbers early in the film. There's also a semi-poetic surfing-by-night sequence which is well orchestrated.Point Break is daft, but it's good fun. As action bonanzas go, this one still measures up well compared to the more modern competition.</fullReview>

But Swayze does a solid job here and though Reeves doesn't go much beyond his usual two dimensional charisma, he's tailor made for the part so it doesn't really matter. It's well written, nicely shot, and achieves what it sets out to do efficiently yet with enough subtlety to keep the more discerning moviegoer interested. A tale of freedom vs authority, men flying through the air after each other, and some mildly homo-erotic surfing. What more could you want? Well, amongst all the great new-age crime fighting and feminist bank robbery, one scene stands out: Gary Busey eating a meatball Sub while reading Calvin and Hobbes. Bliss.

		<shortDescription>You are now in the bank robbery capital of the world.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film I've seen many times and I don't remember ever seeing it quite like I did today. For the most part, my memory of the film, prior to today's screening, recalled the film's basic plot outline but failed to recall the nitty gritty details that make Point Break a superb action flick. I don't ask much more of my action movies other than they be thrilling, engaging, and entertaining, and Point Break offers all three of these attributes in heavy doses. Upon first glance and on the surface, this is a conventional action movie that manages to raise itself above the norm thanks to fantastic direction from Kathryn Bigelow, incredible stunts, solid performances from a set of A-list actors (both then and now), and several plot twists, all of which add up to make Point Break one of the better action movies of the 1990s.Keanu Reeves portrays Johnny Utah, a rookie FBI agent fresh out of Quantico who is eager to please and get his feet wet. He is paired with a veteran agent with an attitude, Pappas (Gary Busey), and is immediately put on the case of a string of high-profile bank robberies committed by a quartet of men dubbed "The Ex-Presidents," so named for the masks they wear as they commit their crimes (we see Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon, and Lyndon Johnson). Pappas suspects the criminals are surfers based not only on tan lines seen in surveillance camera footage but also on the fact that the robberies only occur in the summer months, leading him to believe that the robberies are connected to the procurement of monies to fund winter surfing expeditions elsewhere in the world. With only one month left before they suspect the string of robberies will conclude until the following summer, Utah goes undercover into the world of surfing and meets Tyler (Lori Petty), a girl whom Utah convinces to help him learn to surf after she saves him from a near-death experience on the waves. Once deeper into this world, Utah, through Tyler, meets Bodhi, a world-class adrenaline junkie who accepts Utah into his gang. Utah's loyalties, ambitions, and emotions will be tested as he finds himself deeper and more involved in this seemingly innocent corner of the world where not everything, or everyone, is as it appears.There's quite a bit to like about Point Break for action/adrenaline film enthusiasts. Keanu Reeves, before he was Jack or Neo, was Johnny Utah in Point Break, a role which put him on the map of action stars and paved the way for him to star in the biggest hits of his career. For as much flack as he gets, he's simply perfect in this role; his persona and demeanor are without equal for the Utah character, and he brings to the role a fantastic screen presence and chemistry with his co-stars, notably Patrick Swayze, also in one of his better roles, but this is not necessarily one of his better performances. Both actors are a natural fit for the film; everything from their appearances to their mannerisms and to their grasp of the underlying tones and conflicts of the story, not to mention their fantastic ability to put on a great show during the various action sequences, help set Point Break apart from other, lesser, dime-a-dozen action vehicles. Also appearing are several actors of note, including John C. McGinley and Tom Sizemore in a cameo appearance.Of course, director Kathryn Bigelow's fantastic direction, eye for action, and keen sense of how to effectively weave a first-rate story is the foundation upon which Point Break is built. Bigelow does a fantastic job in creating a tense, exciting action movie. She knows how to handle the various surprises the movie throws at the audience with unflinching authority, conveying every emotion and twist with almost unparalleled ease and grace, all the while maintaining the tense, blood-and-guts, gritty feel of the movie. Point Break reveals its secrets far earlier than most action movies do, both to the audience and to the characters, and this is perhaps the best aspect of the film. It dares to be different in many regards, this being the most engaging example. It breaks formulas and conventions without isolating itself or pretending to be anything but a slick, well-paced, exciting action flick. All of this combined with its first-rate stunts and sequences (including two fantastic skydiving sequences, the first of which is easily the best sequence in the film thanks not only to its fantastic visuals but also due to the perfect placement of the exciting yet laid back music that accompanies it), Point Break is an action movie lover's delight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Special agent Johnny Utah(Keanu Reeves)is assigned a case along with partner, Pappas(Gary Busey) to find and arrest bank robbers(..who have successfully heisted over 30 banks)who just so happen to be surfers following their charismatic leader, Bodhi(Patrick Swayze), a philosophical, free-spirited "guru" whose mantra of life is tied in with the ocean waves. Utah, undercover, is able to infiltrate Bodhi's gang, falling in love with Tyler(Lori Petty)in the process. When he's cover is blown, Tyler is held up as hostage, used as a bargaining chip so that Bodhi can escape with a load of loot along with his amigos, stringing along Utah so that they can pull off their heist without fail..but when Bodhi makes a questionable decision to raid a bank's vault, and an off-duty cop plays hero, everything spirals out of control.Exhilarating surfing sequences and jaw-droppingly stunning sky-diving scenes propel this action flick..amazing how such a testosterone, macho flick could be directed by a woman, and it's a major credit to Kathryn Bigelow for she orchestrates some startlingly effective shootouts(..quite a violent film, very dependent of blood squibs)and a phenomenal chase(Utah on foot, pursuing Bodhi under a Nixon mask) through a suburban neighborhood. The dialogue is cornball(..and loaded with profanity), with an emphasis on Bodhi's spiritual view of the waves and life in general. Swayze is cool personified, no matter what kind of jargon comes from his character. Reeves had a way of getting parts in great movies, his looks fit the setting of the film, and he is convincing as an agent-turned-surfer(..well, when he talks "surfer", it sounds authentic). Petty is perky and peppy, with a lot of spunk..I don't think she's ever been as sexy as she is here. Busey steals every scene he's in..such a delightful presence and when he punches out smart-mouth a$$hole superior Harp(John C McGinley), I expect a round of applause. As I've mentioned before, I'm an adrenaline junkie when it comes to films about characters living life on the edge, with only tragedy awaiting those who break the law, no matter the reason, with car chases(..this one has a doozy, before it descends into the foot race between Reeves and Swayze), shootouts, and other highly stylized action sequences defying logic or good sense(..does anyone truly believe this gang of surfers could pull off so many robberies or that Reeves would just let Swayze get away?). The real mind-boggling highlight has to be when Utah leaps from a plane without a parachute to catch up with Bodhi. The very definition of guilty pleasure and really hard to take too seriously(..even though it seems to be toned quite seriously).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this movie again, and while on the surface it looks like a stereotypical action flick, and in some ways maybe it is, I was actually surprised how much I enjoyed it.There were a few things that were a little contrived, at least for a "cop movie." I don't understand why the chief of police always has to be written as a jerk or why there is always those two arrogant cops that crack jokes all the time, etc. A minor gripe, however.I originally saw this movie in the 90s when it was newer. Now that it's had time to age, it feels like a classic, and kept me yearning for those good old days when action films weren't all about superheroes, redundant CGI usage and mindlessly drawn-out action scenes. They really don't make 'em like they used to. Everything is proportionate, the special effects are as real as they can be, and the characters grab hold of you. Why is character development seemingly so hard to find these days? Granted, I'm not a big Keanu Reeves fan, but it's not necessarily the actors that make this movie. It's everything about it. The story in this film is rock solid. It's a thriller wrapped in a collage of fantastic cinematography and spectacle. The ocean and surfing scenes are beautifully shot, even artsy in a way. All in all, the story and the action are successfully interwoven to deliver a "pure adrenaline" caper. It's an interesting combination of human drama and extreme edginess, and yet it works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a film junkie and had never gotten around to seeing this one. I've seen "Tank Girl" (to name another lori petty movie) and I hadn't seen this. But this lived up to the hype. It also lives up to every "you're a cop living on the edge" movie cliché...but for some reason that rubbed me entirely the right way here. there are scenes of laughably bad dialogue, with keanu and gary busey not being ones to elevate bad dialogue in the first place, but again that failed to bother me. the action scenes were well done, memorable, original, and the chase scenes were heroically over the top (one in particular, I think, was borrowed heavily upon for a chase scene in "Brick," a recommended film in my opinion). the plot worked, and keanu's blank stare again worked implausibly in his favor. perhaps this explains my atheism. anyway, there are probably 1000 positive reviews for this movie, but I recommend it, and you can trust me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, let me begin by saying I thoroughly enjoyed this film back in 1991. I watched it for the first time since last night. So let me add that it's now patently clear I must have been a childish oaf who knew nothing about movies in 1991. You can go on all day about action sequences, adrenalin rushes or direction but if you're saddled with a script as laughable as this one then there really is no point. I had to turn this trash off after 20 minutes. Oh, and Keanu's acting didn't help either. Normally I don't mind Keanu but he was unwatchable in this garbage. The scene he's shouting out at Gary Busey about "feeling alive" had me in fits. For IQ's of 50 and below.Niz</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish the movie had not been so ridiculous. An FBI agent going undercover, under his real name, AND doing raids on more or less the same group he is trying to infiltrate? Insane. A group of 13 year-olds would take more precautions than these FBI agents are shown doing. There MIGHT have been a movie here. The agent, Keanu Reeves, is shown getting close to a surfer gal in order to get 'in' with the surfers; he tells her his parents died (which is a lie--they are still alive, we later find out, in Ohio) to gain sympathy from her, because he has found out thru records that her parents died in an accident when she was a child. This kind of thing brings out a type of remorse in the 'best' of circumstances. It is HARD to go undercover. That's why J.Edgar Hoover didn't even LET his agents go undercover: no way, back then. But the foolishness in this movie is too, too much. Too bad, because some of it is pretty cool. Altho there is a slip-up: there are no football scholarships in law school.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak story, plot; Lori Petty even worse than usual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that would have you believe that surfing is a mystical endeavor, allowing one to heighten awareness and become closer to if not one with the godhead nature. Instead of the leisure sport of ski bums w/ surfboards don't work and hang at the beach. Which is cool, but that doesn't make it some ethereal vision-quest.Lori Petty can always be counted on to irritate without doing any acting and this is no exception. I think she wants to be feisty, scrappy, empowering - those things. She's done much TV and it shows: she releases her emotions by staring at the camera. She has 3 modes: self-righteous indignation when she's wronged; self-righteous indignation when someone else is wronged; self-righteous indignation with a little girl voice when she's willing to have sex. All by herself she managed to ruin "League of their own". Here, could there have been worse choice for a love interest?The real shame is the plot &amp; script. Kathryn Bigelow is way better than this: K19, Near Dark, Strange Days - all brilliant. But she was involved w/ schlock-/ fluff-meister Cameron then and he wrote the script.Overall this was intended to be a heart-pounding, blood-rushing, edge-o-ur-seat action fest. This is accomplished by having Reeves jump out of a plane without a parachute and catch up to the bad guy. Where they macho-talk about who will pull the ripcord until they're just a few-hundred feet over the ground. They survive of course.It's about surfer bank robbers. FBI agent Busey has figured this out and says "They're surfers. Look at the evidence: they rob in summer only."The robbers are meticulous and perfect in execution, except for the last job where the leader changes the plan without telling the rest of the gang and of course this allows them to be shot/ caught.But it doesn't even end there: There's the no-parachute scene about; then Reeves tracks his man all over; then there's a confrontation where he lets him go to die in some big weather.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top 5 action movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Point Break has been referenced dozens of times in pop culture, but it's really a movie you have to watch and experience to understand. Keanu Reaves rides the edge between his new friends/lover and his FBI career. There are some really big actors like Gary Busey, but the synergy between Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reaves is palpable the entire film. Swayze plays an adrenaline junkie named Bodhi with a deep understanding of the ocean and the people who inhabit it.There are some really great action sequences in this film. It feels a lot more genuine than The Matrix (an obvious comparison) since it seems to take place in a world based in reality. The characters are well developed and you feel torn between the leading roles by the end of the film. Overall I feel pretty much anyone could enjoy this film, unless the violence really turns you off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It takes a female director to make something so macho</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Point Break is a cult classic action thriller and was Kathryn Bigelow until her Oscar success with The Hurt Locker. Point Break is a testosterone filled, macho film filled with male posturing throughout as a rookie FBI agent, Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) who has to go undercover in the surfer scene to find a group of bank robbers known as the ex-presidents, but soon becomes absorbed by the adrenaline seeking ways of surf leader Bodhi (Patrick Swayze).Point Break is a very cheesy and some of the acting is pretty bad, but there is no denying that Point Break has a charm to it. Bigelow shows even at this stage of her career that she is an extremely confidence action director, allowing action to flow, using hand-held to follow the action, give it energy and she does not shy away from the violence. She is able to add tension during her shootouts, fight scenes and the robberies. There is some great sequences such as the shoot-out, the third robbery and the skydiving sequences.Point Break is a product of its time and it does have problems, but it is easy to see why people enjoy, particular thanks to Bigelow's action direction which does go over the top at times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Derivative undercover cop movie + totally radical surfers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 18 when this movie came out, and I didn't understand why people my age liked it so much. I still don't. Some people seem to feel that it's a satire of testosterone-fueled action movies, but, if it is, it just doesn't do a very good job. If anything, I think it works better as a derivative, cheesy action movie, rather than any kind of satire.I like Kathryn Bigelow, but I think that Point Break is probably her worst movie. Even her worst movie is better than a lot of the crap that gets released to theaters, however. I liked the scenes with the ex-presidents, during the robberies, and I liked some of the action sequences. The rest of the movie just didn't do anything for me. A young FBI agent who goes undercover, is drawn into the lifestyle, and feels conflicted when it comes time to take down his new friends? Seen it. Seen it a hundred times. I've seen it done better, I've seen it done worse, but I'll admit that this is the first time I've seen it done with surfers. However, I really don't care about surfers, their lifestyle, their quasi-mystical bullshit, or pretty much anything else related to surfers or surfing. However, that seems to be a huge draw to the fans of this movie.Patrick Swayze, as Bodhi, the undisputed King of All Things Radical, seems custom written to appeal directly to rebellious teenage boys, who will revel in his free spirit and mastery of all things radical. The other antagonists, however, are so underdeveloped and interchangeable that you can't really tell which ones are which. James LeGros, whom I always like, stands out the most, but that's still not saying much.Keanu Reeves was coming off of Bill &amp; Ted, and he was looking for something radically different. Once Keanu started to relax a bit and stop trying to overcompensate for his Bill &amp; Ted years, his acting became better, but this was still a bit of an awkward time for him. His acting is wooden at times, though he still comes off as likable.It's not an especially good or bad movie, and it perplexes me why people my age like it so much. I suspect that these are the extreme sports fans, surfing fans, and Keanu fans. I don't really fit into any of those categories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Patrick Swayze, Keanu Reeves, Lori Petty and Gary Busey star in this 1991 action film. Johnny Utah (Reeves) is an ex-quarterback who is a rookie FBI agent. He tries to solve a case involving a group of bank robbers, "The Ex-Presidents" and learns that they're surfers. Busey plays veteran agent, Angelo Pappas who becomes his partner and soon, Johnny decides to go undercover as a surfer. He meets woman, Tyler (Petty) who teaches him how to surf and they fall for each other. Swayze plays her surfer ex-boyfriend, Bodhi who longs to catch the big wave and is really the leader of the bank robbers. Bodhi and Johnny become friends, but they eventually discover who each other really is. I've always liked this film and Patrick and Keanu were great together. I recommend this good action flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this case, important is the final taste. The mixture of dust, small gestures and few words. The bread crust from a lost kitchen, pages of old book, nature as special character, Reeves Kenner in a great role and some other teens in the skin of a seductive shadow. So, a strange western. The ingredients and the recipes are same. But the fire and water are more different. Crumbs of Russian movies and drops of melancholic circles. A world. In the search of its sense. Or soul. Or past. In fact, a story behind the camp fire. The hero is gray. The evil is insignificant. The fear is only ant. The moral is a testimony with Muslim nuances. A beautiful film. And that is enough!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reaves plays one time star college QB now undercover FBI agent, trying to bust masked bank robbers suspected to be surfers. I really like Reaves in these sort of movies, he has a brash but at the same time modest tone that works for me, and Swayze is spot on as the charismatic leader of the suspected robbers. The macho interplay between Reaves and Swayze is sometimes contrived but usually entertaining. Although she is not a classic Hollywood bombshell I also think Petty is effective as Reaves' surfing instructor and entry to the group (and eventual love interest). There's some unpleasant parts of this movie including a fight that involves a lawn mower (that I usually switch off), and the extent of Reaves' involvement in the group staggers credibility towards the end, but the surfing parts are good. About 20 minutes too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action and annoying haircuts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Point Break is one of those films that is simultaneously seen as being a bit crap while being pretty good. I suppose the best way to review this title might be to break it down into good and bad. So here goes?The Good: The action set-pieces are this film's crowning jewels. Kathryn Bigelow shows excellent ability as an action director. The extended chase scene was brilliantly paced and orchestrated. It never gets unrealistic and is edited together perfectly. Likewise, the sky-diving scenes are very well filmed. There's not an awful lot to them, they are just very well photographed and add an excellent dimension to proceedings. Patrick Swayze is also very good too. He has a fair bit of charisma here and he is the well-conceived character in the movieThe Bad: Too many annoying haircuts for me. I know it's the early 90's but still I felt that there was an excess of bad hair. And to match that, there was far too much surfer-philosophizing/drivel (delete where appropriate); and all of the chat about the gang of thieves being the people's outlaws was basically atrocious. The police film clichés were a bit full-on too, such as the shouting superiors and the 'throwing away the badge scene'. Keanu Reeves was rubbish. He was even wooden when sky-diving.Overall a good action film though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-paced and unique action movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 7/15/2010 -- 7 out of 10 (Dir-Kathryn Bigelow): Well-paced and unique action movie with Keanu Reeves playing an undercover cop in the surfing world trying to find out who's been robbing a bunch of southern California banks under the name of the Ex-presidents. The group wears masks of the elder statesmen while doing their job and are kind of an anti-establishment Bonnie&amp;Clyde type of group. Patrick Swayze plays a surfer who helps Reeve's character become established with the surfers, but later is found out to be part of the group. Swayze's character has kind of a devil-may-care, try-anything-once mentality and gets him involved in other you-only-live-once activities like sky diving as well. His ultimate goal is to get to Australia to ride the biggest wave ever(according to his calculations) and this is the reason for the bank robbing. Reeves, Swayze and Gary Busey as Reeve's partner are good in their roles and the director keeps the pace moving very well. The ending was extended too long(in my opinion) and it would have been a better movie without the last 10 minutes. Overall, though, this was a well executed, uniquely written piece that surprised me right from the beginning. I heard this movie kind of has a cult following and I understand why. A good effort from an important woman filmmaker and should be viewed by more people, in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never really understood its guilty pleasure status...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... not because I think it's a bad film, but because I think it's freaking awesome! It came as a genuine surprise to me that the film is viewed by many as a film so bad it's crossed the border into good. I'm not going to waste letters critiquing other people's critiques, but I will give my own two cents.I think whenever you talk about a film that is 25+ years old, it's necessary to talk about your own personal context. I believe I was 11 or 12 years old when I saw this on VHS (some of you young'uns may have to google that one). Keanu Reeves at this stage was best known for playing Theodore Logan in the Bill and Ted series, there was no Speed or Matrix movies to go by. I had seen Ghost and I think Roadhouse, but I didn't have any clear memories of Patrick Swayze, apart from thinking he was "da man." Gary Busey was not a part of my life and I honestly had no idea who he was. I had never seen a surfing movie (especially not Big Wednesday, Busey's entry into the genre and well worth a look for being IMO far more deserving of this film's reputation) or a sky diving film, but I found both pastimes quite fascinating (and have indulged in both as I got older).Point Break is the story of FBI Agent Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) who is trying to track down a group of bank robbers. Believing the theory of an older agent, Angelo Pappas (Gary Busey) that the gang of robbers are surfers, Utah decides to go undercover and infiltrates a tight knit group of surfers, headed by serial risk taker Bodhi (Patrick Swayze, awesome). Utah takes a liking to Bodhi and his life philosophy, but eventually learns that Bodhi's gang are the bank robbers he's looking for, and has to fight his feelings of kinship with Bodhi to try and bring the gang down.As an 11 year old I had never seen anything like this. The great surfing and sky diving action, the brilliantly filmed chase sequences, the bank robbery. Ted Logan in a serious role? Patrick Swayze as a gun toting wise man? This was film making on a different level to any of the movies I'd seen to that point.Coming back as an adult, I choose not to care about inconsistencies and illogical happenings in the story for a very simple reason: I am entertained by what's happening in front of me. The action sequences in this are breathtaking. Patrick Swayze's sheer presence in this is off the charts. And even in 1991, Reeves has the look and presence of a star. I think as time has gone on we've gotten more and more guilty of breaking a film, or anything for that matter, we are critiquing into various parts and trying to come up with a sum total. But something as experiential as watching a film doesn't lend itself to that. Does Keanu Reeves give, in many ways, a wretched performance? Probably, but does it take me out of the film at all? Gotta say no. Is there some really dopey dialogue at times? Yes, but it's not out of place with the message or flow of the film and again doesn't take me out of it. Do things happen in this that would never and could never happen in the real world? Yes, but I can buy that they are happening in the universe the film exists in. I am willing to give this film a lot in the way of suspending disbelief because I am enjoying the ride.I don't come to this as some old fogey who thinks "they don't make them like they used to." I love modern cinema. I really enjoyed the Fast and the Furious, which riffs heavily on this film, and its various sequels; I liked the Hunger Games films, hell, I even liked Transformers and do the occasional Harry Potter marathon. But it is baffling to me that this film has become so maligned and the butt of jokes when it is easily the equal of any action film made today.For its well directed action sequences, for Swayze's presence and for the whole message and feel of the film, it deserves to be remembered as one of the 90s best action flicks. They really should have known better than to try and remake it and we really should know better than to dismiss it so easily.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic. Who knew?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has no business holding up as well as it does, and in the hands of a lesser director than future Oscar winner Kathryn Bigelow it probably wouldn't. There's just a craft and skill on display here that's several notches above most of its genre contemporaries. The action scenes in particular are absolutely first rate; Especially the sky diving stuff and the foot chase between Keanu Reeves' Johnny Utah and Patrick Swayze's Bodhi. In both cases you feel like you're a participant. It's great work.Keanu's Johnny Utah is the main character, and he's likable here (because Keanu is always likable), but the real stars are Swayze as the charismatic surfing guru, Bodhi and Gary Busey as Utah's grizzled partner, Angelo Pappas. Swayze is so good it's scary. It's like, if you ran into this guy in real life you'd be drinking the Kool-Aid and asking for seconds. Special mention also goes to Lori Petty. Not only do I find her insanely attractive here (My God, those eyes!), she and Reeves have great chemistry, and she takes what could've been a thankless love interest role and makes it hers.I've seen the trailer for the upcoming remake, and while I can't say for sure whether it'll be good or bad, I do know that the bar for it is set awfully high.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Utah (Reeves) is an ambitious young federal agent who must go undercover as a surfer to infiltrate slick bank robbers known as the Ex-Presidents. While undercover, he befriends Petty and Swayze, both of whom know the local surfing scene and might be able to help network him to the robbers, but this becomes a conflict in and of itself when he falls in love with the former and establishes a fond respect for the latter, neither of which will approve his true identity of being a fed. Reeves and Busey cause so much destruction trying to catch the bad guys, yet we never see them filling out reports or any other paperwork. According to this movie, people can have conversations while skydiving! Hmm. Despite the constant suspension of disbelief required to actually buy into the movie's nonsense, POINT BREAK has an undeniable charm that make you allow (and even embrace) the obvious imperfections. Maybe it's the chemistry of the cast; maybe it's the fact that it's a non-stop roller-coaster ride; maybe it's the sunny-beach action-packed vibe that gives off this unique mixture of relaxation and testosterone. Whatever it is, it works.*** (out of four)</fullReview>

The combination of Keanu Reeve's perfectly-cast performance, and Patrick Swayze's on- the-money depiction puts this one in the books.The problems are obvious, and you know what's going to happen right on down the line.*** SPOILERS ***The guy who goes undercover and gets too close. He falls for a girl, which of course, makes things super complicated. He gets a man crush on the surf leader. And, of course, there's the whole why-the-heck-are-we- following-this-group-of-guys-unless-they're-the-bank-robbers thing? The answers are all the ones you know almost right away.The movie does get creative with what happens after everyone knows who everyone one is. The game of chess that's played is where the movie finally travels into uncharted territory. But, the problems only multiply like crazy as the film goes on like "So, the agents aren't wearing vests?," "These guys don't have backup?," "FBI Agents really act crazy like that?," "Even though you love this girl, you are going to sacrifice lots of lives to save her?," "Okay, you're really going to jump out without a chute, Keanu?," "It's pretty darn unlikely you could hold on to that guy when the parachute gets pulled!," "There's no way that Reeves would still be an FBI Agent after that!," "I don't think FBI Agents travel the world for years to find one dude. Isn't that what Interpol does?" and "Oh, c'mon, you're not gonna quit the FBI after all this, dude!"*** END SPOILERS ***Kathryn Bigelow knows how to shoot a movie, that's for sure! And, she is why the film works as much as it does, in the end. And, as said, the performances are spot on. Reeves has always been seen as a "dude" kind of guy, and here he gets to do that. Swayze gets to perform a unique character more so than his usual action-star stuff. The cinematography by Donald Peterman is very good. Mark Isham does well with the film score. But, stuff like John McGinley's yelling "police sergeant" kind of thing is wildly over the top!****** (6 Out of 10 Stars)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Point Break is Keanu Reeves becoming an action hero. Right on. He's alright, not as bad as people often exaggerate. The Surfing scenes are shot well. The movie looks good. Patrick Swayze and Gary Busey are also good. Tom Sizemore has a 1 minute scene but his 1 minute scene proves what a great actor he is. This movie is just cool. I've always liked it. I can't really look at this movie any deeper than that but I guess everyone just needs a cool action movie now and then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion this film is Keanu Reeves best (Speed and Matrix 's included). As for the movie, great action, great adventure, great surfing shots! From start to finish it's a pure rush and the movie's ending is perfect. It's got a little bit of everything. This film is way underrated in my opinion and should be at a least a 7/10 overall. It's a modern day classic and still remains a sleeper that many people have yet to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Adrenaline Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Some Spoilers** Set your heart pounding, your pulse racing and your senses into overdrive in Point Break.Keanu Reeves is the new, fresh faced FBI recruit Johnny Utah, who gets assigned the case to track down a gang of bank robbers operating in the southern part of California. He is assigned to this task with veteran FBI agent Angello Pappis (Gary Busey). Soon, Utah becomes involved with a team of surfers, lead by Bodhi (Patrick Swayze), who is a charismatic adrenaline junkie who'll do anything for a thrill. As Johnny and Bodhi become friends, Johnny soon gets swept up into the endless days and nights of surfing, partying, and overall pushing it to the extreme. As Johnny gets closer to craking the case - he soon learns many secrets and important lessons, if you want the ultimate thrill, you have to pay the ultimate price...Point Break is just that, a pretty vivid piece of relaxing and not taking it too seriously, for a good time and a good story to tell. All the performances from the cast are peak, maybe except for the fact that Keanu does look lost for the better half of the film, though the chase scenes, as well as sky-diving and the fabulous surfing scenes remind us of what a unique piece of film this is.We get to look inside the heart of a surfer, or, for that matter, what drives a certain human to do what he loves, this is portyared throughout the character Bodhi, which was played well by Patrick Swayze. I like Swayze, his pretty vivid in the fact that he can hold your atention in this film, which is an added benifit.Gary Busey, another one of my favorite actors, plays a pretty routine part, yet still makes the best of what he has got, and makes his character more enjoyable for the better part.Either way you look at the film, "Point Break" is good viewing for the mid teen to 39 year old bracket, it can hold your attention, and has a pretty decent plot that wont get you too confused. (although repeated viewings are recomended if you take in all the stunts and adrenaline action after a first viewing) It has likable characters that you feel you would like to know, but at the same time, doesnt let you get too close.Well worth checking out, if its on late night viewing, or, with a variety of other pop-corn flicks!**1/2-OUTOF-*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POINT BREAK is a lot of fun, hugely enjoyable and actually well made. Kathryn Bigelow's directs with such energy its easy to overlook POINT BREAK's shortcomings, which are plenty. A group of surfers rob banks to finance their "endless summer", following the waves with the seasons. Enter Special Agent Johnny Utah (Reeves), a man with an unlikely name and a look in his eyes that Lori Petty tells me is a "kamikaze stare" but I thought was just a blank look. He's an ex-college football hero who can pass as a young surfer to infiltrate the group. Utah and his partner, the irrepressible Angelo Pappas (Busey), work to catch the tight knit group of surfers, as Utah takes surfing lessons from Lori Petty to better his chances of "blending in". Of course, the surfer/bank robbers in question end up being Petty's ex-boyfriend, the enigmatic Bodhi (Swayze) and his cohorts. Utah bonds with them and soon begins to buy into Bodhi's surfer mysticism. The best thing about this film is the action. The second best is the questionable casting choices. Reeves' Johnny Utah is constantly being credited with traits that he obviously doesn't have, causing one to wonder who the part might have been written for. Petty sounds like the surfer girl from Jersey. Swayze is utterly hilarious as Bodhi, and why is he always trying to pull some karate in movies? Does he even know any karate? Another topic for another day. Gary Busey is at his Buseyest in this one, post-motorcycle wreck. Also, kudos to any film that works in the line: "I'll see you in the next life." That's a line I like because when you hear it you know these guys aren't planning on seeing each other for a long time. Any movie that has that line in it I generally like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Point Break" is one of those movies that is so ridiculous, that it's entertaining. I won't go into the wacky plot, as I'm sure you all know it. Keanu Reeves' performance is so appalling, that he's fun to watch. It's great fun to watch him deliver most of his lines, and that blank look he has on his face, most of the time. Swayze is a lot of fun, too, and of course, he gives a better performance.But it's Busey who seals the show. This man delivers his lines, with so much manic, loony energy. He's an absolute pleasure to watch. Action wise, "Point Break" delivers big time; The FBI raid, the classic on-foot chase, between Utah and Bodhi, who is wearing a Ronald Reagan mask, and the two sky-diving scenes. "Point Break" is simply a guilty pleasure. *** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was, on my personal scale (Blows-Sucks-Bites-Ok-Good-Really Good-Totally Bitchin' Kick Ass!) is "OK." This is sort of a cult classic type flick. The acting was not good. Keanu Reeves is not a good actor. This and Matrix, The (1999) are the only movies where his acting hasn't made it a very bad movie. Basically he plays Ted (Bill and Ted) with a badge and a surfboard. Gary Busey, who played the best bad guy ever in Lethal Weapon (1987), was type casted as the bad guy in Lethal Weapon except this time he is a good guy *gasp*. And I applaud Patrick Swayze for making me forget Dirty Dancing (1987) for two hours until some moron said, "Wow this was a load better than Dirty Dancing." The action was Ok because it was over the top. *SPOILER* The fact that when Bohdi (Swayze) finally decides to break his own rule there's an off duty cop their, what luck for the cops. But the off duty cop did shoot Reeves which is something I have yet to accomplish. The overall plot was terrible. Who thinks this rubbish up? And the way these surf morons talk is "like, totally bad man." How come every surfer or skateboarder is Jeff Spiccoli from Fast Times At Ridgemont High (1982)?At this point the movie is somewhere between Sucks and Ok, no it Sucks. The thing that makes it ok is the Ex-President Rubber Masks idea. The guys who wrote it, Rick King (I) and W. Peter Iliff , made those masks famous. I, myself had three of them not knowing they were in this movie. I salute you Mr. King. I salute you Mr. Iliff.In review: Plot: Sucks. Action: Ok. Acting: Ok. Script: Sucks. *Bonus* Ex- President Mask Idea: Totally Bitchin' Kick Ass! Overall: Ok.</fullReview>

The scene where Johnny Utah sky dives out of a plane without a parachute is built up to be made so believable. The scenery is breathtaking as well. This was the first movie starring Keanu Reeves that I saw. At the time it came out, I commented to myself that this guy is slightly different in an original way than most other actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great but much ignored thriller, because none of my friends have ever heard of it. It's a story of a man pursuing another man or a hunter hunting a hunted, which in itself is greatly fascinating and deeply philosophical. The two guys in the movie are as different as night and day, yet they share in common many manly qualities, most notably their great determination, athleticism and love of a testosterone rush. When these two men cross paths, it's a clash of the titans. The hunter is the good guy who is determined, willing to risk it all and do whatever it takes, to get his man while the other guy, the hunted, is just as determined to break free of his hunter's relentless pursuit. When it is all over, you can't help but falling in love with both of them. They both are just so cool and charismatic.The movie contains some truly remarkable scenes. The foot chase is so breathtaking that it just towers above the rest. The surfing scenes are powerful, awe-inspiring and unforgettable. For those of us who are even intimidated by the sight of a surf board to ever attempt surfing ourselves, this is as close as one gets to the real thing. And the best parts for me are in between the action scenes. Sandwiched between those supercharged, adrenaline filled, action packed scenes, there are moments of calm and tranquil. It soothes the nerves. All this is from the genius of a director who really knows what she is doing.Word of advice. Must be enjoyed with the best sound system possible, most preferably Dolby 5.1 surround sound or DTS. The sound of the crashing waves is just awesome.Great action flick. Don't miss it. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World's longest 2-hour movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people would say that there's something wonderfully Zen about "Point Break". But the truth is that there's something far more Einstein-esque in this movie. From the start of the "Fox Fanfare" to the end credits' roll, it's just a hair over two hours in real time, but in observed time, it feels more like five hours.The funny thing is that it doesn't drag. Unlike other James Cameron projects like "Titanic" (where you were practically begging the iceberg to make its cameo) or "Terminator 2" (Please get out of your dream, Sarah, and go waste the evil computer programmer) the lulls rarely last more than a few minutes, and faster than you can say "hands up!" we're back to some action. (This pretty much confirms the theory that executive producers just sit back, take the credit, and don't do a whole helluva lot. But I digress.)Certainly the casting was inspired. Getting Keanu Reeves to play a dopey/stoned surf dude gave new meaning to the phrase "a role he was born to play". Sort of like Madonna playing a foul-mouthed floozy in "League of Their Own."With bank robbing, surfing, midnight beach football and guns lots of guns, grab some junk food and enjoy some junk entertainment. But be prepared to spend more time than you think you need. (7 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a strange combination: surfing and bank robberies. However, I think they work pretty well with each other.This is a movie that shows both sides of the law, much like Heat. So this is really Heat with surfing.Patrick Swayze steals the show here as Bodhi, the leader of a surfing gang who lives for adrenaline. You really can connect to how he feels about life, surfing, and how they connect. Keanu Reeves plays Keanu Reeves as Johnny Utah, an FBI agent who goes undercover as a surfer in order to find a group of bank robbers who surf in their free time. Gary Busey plays the comical likable Pappas, Utah's partner who is with him 100% through this mess. Lori Petty was (IMO) unattractive and annoying as Tyler, Utah's love interest.The music score was what really set the mood in scenes during this movie. There were also a lot of great shots of waves and surfing.Plot-wise, this was actually a good summer blockbuster.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great summer movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Point Break falls perfectly into the category of the late lazy summer movie. They come out after July 4 in the heat of late July and early August allowing movie audiences to retreat from the scorching heat for some cool entertainment in the movie auditoriumKeanu Reeves is Special Agent Johnny Utah who just graduated from Quantico and finds his first assignment in the FBI Los Angeles Office, Bank Robbery Division. His partner is Angelo Pappas, played by Gary Busey.Their first assignment is to find the ex-Presidents. They wear masks of Ronald Reagan, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, and Jimmy Carter and only go for the cash in the drawers instead of going for the vault.Pappas has the idea that the ex-Presidents are surfers, based on a scrap of forensic evidence once left at a scene. Since Utah is the young one, he poses as a surfer in order to go undercover and hopefully infiltrate the group.Utah makes a few friends during his undercover operation. One of which being Bohdi, played by Patrick Swayze. He and his group of new-age surfers take Johnny to the edge. This goes even farther when they go skydiving for an afternoon. Once Johnny's one lead finds a dead end, he realizes Bohdi is the mastermind of the ex-Presidents. Enter the dilemma. They have formed a friendship. Utah develops a conflict: go after Bohdi, or let him go.At the outset, action films are rarely cinematic masterpieces. They rely much more on stunts, crashes, explosions, and sex. But what more do you want in an action movie?Goldfinger, Die Hard, Lethal Weapon were anomalies, because they give an audience character depth, interesting villains, and good plots. However, Point Break gives us Reeves, Swayze, and Busey who are decent and charismatic action stars, but have no real acting ability.Also, action movies love the break laws. The most glaring one are two very long falling sequences in skydiving scenes. If they really fell that long, they would have needed oxygen tanks. Moreover, in both scenes, the characters talk to each other which is almost impossible.Even more troubling is the lapse of logic towards the end. Utah does participate in a bank robbery while undercover, and an off-duty police officer and security guard are killed. Somehow, he still has his job in the end.Still, these characters, mixed with well-paced action sequences, cool stunts, slick photography, sex, and a decent story, Point Break works. True, it is not a cinematic masterpiece, but definitely entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film about surfing bank-robbers ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard to believe that this film is over fifteen years old now. The story is still fairly exciting without ever taking itself too seriously.In most action films the action is mostly the hero chasing and fighting with the bad guys, while there is plenty of that in Point Break there is also plenty of action where characters are just having fun surfing and skydiving which I found more enjoyable than the chasing and fighting. Anybody who has seen "Hot Fuzz" will have a laugh at the "shooting in the air" scene.The plot concerns two FBI agents played by Keanu Reeves and Gary Busey who are hunting a group of bank robbers who's identity is unknown but who Busey believes are surfers who rob banks to fund their lifestyle. Reeves goes under cover learning how to surf so he can get in with surfers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Point Break. a great film of the 90's. in my opinion one of the great action films along with under siege, die hards 1&amp;3 and the Bourne trilogy.the cast is excellent - Reeves is good as Utah and Swayze is superb as the villain Bodhi. Reeves is made for Utah but it could have easily been played by someone else. Swayze as a villain - a rare treat and strange sight but he pulls it off fantastically.Special mention to the Scene stealer and always fab Gary Busey. He is great in every scene - especially outside the bank when reading comics and eating the meatball sandwiches. He plays a good guy for a change and is excellent. (he is one of my favourite screen baddies along with tommy lee Jones and Jeremy irons). This in my opinion is the performance of his career - topping the buddy holly story and blowing away rough riders. he should have had a better career after this bad sadly for all the busey die hards it went downhill.A great exhibition of filmaking.8/10.</fullReview>

I have to give it to this movie, they don't make them like this anymore and thats a shame. Patrick Swayze just went downhill after this movie, maybe it took it out of him to play Bohdi, or however you spell it, basically the same character he played from Road House, only a bad guy. Reeves was in his 'no wayyyy: Bill and Ted' version here. it still makes me laugh as he tries to act! Gary Busey was great as usual. The action was top notch and surprising well done. The house shoot out, the last bank robbery, and the car chase which ended with a mad foot race pursuit which ended with "Johnny Utah" shooting into the air wildly...screaming, are still some of the best action scenes put to film. A great actioner from the early 90s!!</fullReview>

Being only 20, it's sometimes really enjoyable to find an "older" film i enjoy, and i'm sure in 10 or so years time this film will still be able to hold its ground, as the plot although being rather impossible, is rather believable. I didn't expect myself to enjoy the movie, as the story line didn't really appeal to me at first, especially not the surfing parts, but as soon as i started watching the mix of keanu reeves, comedy and fast-paced action, i didn't even want to leave the sofa. The film has a really nice plot which is very different to the typical FBI/detective films of today. I would definitely re-watch this film again if given the chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that I should not enjoy "Point Break" as much as I do. I know that the plot is ridiculous, the characters are hollow and that no one can surf a Tsunami, but I just can't help it. I love this film.Maybe it is because the film appeals to me on a basic masculine level. I've never considered myself much of a macho man, but something about "Pure adrenalin, right?! The ultimate rush. Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump," as described to Keanu Reeves by Patrick Swayze just prior to a "most awesome" skydiving scene.Johnny Utah (Reeves) is a rookie FBI agent straight out of the academy who has been assigned to the Los Angeles Bank Robbery Unit, partnered up with seasoned and feisty Special Agent Angelo Pappas (Gary Busey). Together, the two investigate a series of bank robberies which leads them on the trail of a group of surfers led by a spiritual guru named Bohdi (Swayze). Before long, Utah becomes entranced by Bohdi's carefree philosophies and begins to question what team he is actually playing for. He also falls for the hardened beach babe, Tyler (Lori Petty) who becomes Utah's surfing instructor.From amazing surfing and skydiving visuals to outrageous foot chases, this film is all action. It might lack 100% realism, but it packs a very exciting, stiff punch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a somewhat mainstream storyline of two FBI agents who are trying to catch a gang of bank-robbers while taking out their initial age-related rivalry, this movie is to my mind - technically - a milestone of the action cinema.I saw this movie several times - at cinemas on video and on TV - and my first and most important advice is to see it on the big screen or with a high resolution. Practically every scene plays with displaying of the elements, like heavy rain in the shooting-scene right at the beginning, the waves and surfing shots in the middle, or the skydiving-scene close to the end.Being an outstanding piece of photography and directing as well as an overall good acting, this movie is close to having a short holiday (and I always like to see it when it's time for one).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the words COOL meant something...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst just looking up and down my local department shop DVD section I was lucky enough to stumble upon Point Break. I have never really sat down and watched it with a review eye as I would normally do so yesterday I sat down for the third time and watched it from start to finish! Point Break reminds of a time in my youth when the words cool were applied to someone who was living up to the word , this film reflects a time and place where people were growing up with not a care in the world and back then it was easy to just kick back and relax unlike in the helter-skelter world of today. Back then you were a rebel that everybody else wanted to be like with reason unlike today's gun-totting bad boy image which is not really interesting nor one feels obligated to defend. The story is really simple, a young Keauna Reeves along with the ever so funny Gary Busi to catch a group of bank robbers who dress up like the ex-presidents, however on his investigation he becomes involved with the world of surfing and learns a bit about the 90's culture. The film does a great job of starting of as a buddy-cop movie and then to a romance and then to an exploration into the world of surfing and extreme sports but at the same time not losing track of what it was made for. The stunts and action was great even by today's CGI infested standards , the script and acting was great for me the star of the show was Patrick Sawazye with his philosophical adrenaline junkie ' live life to its fullest' Bodhi. My only complaint was that we did not get to see enough of the ex-presidents in action (a longer haired,younger version of Paul Le Gros as Nixon was brilliant.) To conclude Point Break is a summer film worth checking out if you have nothing better to do , or if you just want to chill-out. You will gain nothing but you will not lose anything either , treat as a piece of nostalgia.POINT BREAK - 7.8 OUT OF 10WHY BE A SERVANT OF THE LAW WHEN YOU CAN BE ITS MASTER!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is very clever, highly creative and swings from cop movie to romance to adventure film and ties all the elements together. Bigelow's camera movements are tight and creative. The scene where Johnny Utah chases Bode through a series of yards, houses, viaducts and the like features some great direction. Instead of multiple cuts simulating action, the camera seems to chase the characters and really captures the energy.I guess Bigelow got the directing job since she was married to the ego-maniacal James Cameron, who produced this film. I' a bit surprised she didn't have more of a major directing career.While there was some degree of stereotypical cop banter (the blowing of the undercover cop's cover was a fine example), the concept and execution are really top notch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually watched point break for the first time just a few weeks ago. I thought it was going to be a boring old movie and it turned out to be great. Keanu Reeves was awesome and so was Patrick Swayze. They played their roles with such passion as if the viewer was almost there in each and every scene. Watching them surf was fun, especially when Reeves was learning. I am not a surfer so I could relate every time he fell off the board attempting to catch a wave. The first time the viewers saw Lori who played Tyler you would have no idea about the connection she plays in the movie. One of the main parts I loved was when the First Ladies robbed the banks. It was suspenseful trying to figure out who it was. I caught on, but I'm not going to tell you. The whole correspondence between the friends and the criminal/cop was interesting. It was the classic question of " Do you chose a friend over the law and your job?" Hope you watch the movie and enjoy as much as I did. I'd love to tell more but I may give it away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm normally not a huge fan of action movies, but once in a while I can enjoy it. The main reason why I watched this movie was because there were some known names in it. I know, Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves aren't exactly known as the best actors ever, but I didn't have much else to do so I decided to give this movie a try...The story is about some surfers who rob banks from June until October. They call themselves the "ex-presidents" because they wear masks of the ex-presidents Reagan, Carter, Nixon and Johnson. They commit these robberies, so they can keep surfing all year long and don't have to find a job. The FBI has tried to catch them, but the gang always managed to escape. Johnny Utah, a freshman at the FBI's bank-robbery crew, will go undercover to infiltrate the gang of surfers and to stop their criminal activities, but he'll get more action than he bargained for..."Point Break" isn't the best movie to watch when you want to see some great acting or an intelligent story. This isn't exactly Oscar material, but it wasn't as bad as you might expect either. Why? Well, because it never even pretended to be intelligent or great. All it wanted to do was to give the viewer some original action and it succeeded on that point. And that's all you have to expect from it too, because the acting is far from great. It's hard to believe that Keanu Reeves is an undercover FBI agent and Patrick Swayze as the spiritual guru-like leader of the surfers isn't exactly the best choice either. But if you can see past that and when you want to see some good action scenes, than this movie is certainly worth a watch. You'll see a lot of spectacular surfing and sky diving footage, a spectacular car chase, the bank robberies... and I must admit that these scenes were very well orchestrated. I give this movie a 6.5/10 for that.</fullReview>

Bohdi is possible the best character ever in american cinima. He delivers his lines with the same presision fluidity of his gnarly bottom turns. If i am half the man that he is than will someday rule the world. Rad movie 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

This is one of the best, if not the best action movie ever. It rarely stops and when it does it is cool as hell in between. I have seen it numerous times, and have come to love Sir Keanu's half-retardedness. The way he delivers his lines soooo poorly is entertaining enough. Just think we haven't taught a monkey how to drive a car yet we taught Keanu to act! 9 STARS......I LOVED IT!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Point Break has everything a action film should have, non stop action, death defying stunts and a likeable bad guy. This was the second film for Reeves realeased in summber 91 following Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey. Reeves played the role in his methoad acting way and became a action star because of this film. Patrick Swaayze made a good bad guy and Kathryn Bigelow showed a woman can handle an action flick. But mainly Point Break is a good example of a wholly flawed piece of filmmaking that still manages to entertain. The screenplay sputters, veers and stumbles for almost two hours, Keanu Reeves gives a god-awful performance, and the film's veneer of a spiritual agenda is almost deplorably laughable. However, there are enough interesting quirks and decent action sequences to make it a howl to watch. Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis and the young Tom Sizemore make memorable cameos, and as the lead villain, Patrick Swayze is an over-the-top riot. The film might have worked better had it stayed within the realm of action camp, instead of attempting to be taken seriously: Kathryn Bigelow's screenplay and direction are painfully all over the map. Still, there are some stunning stunts and terrific surfing action, and excellent MTV style camerawork that makes for adrenaline-filled fun - despite the fact that the film is by and large ridiculous and inane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Movie Ever Made!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I curse each and every year of my life that was lived without having seen this masterpiece of Modern Cinema!After having witnessed this perfect vision of Presidential Satire, Extreme Sporting, and white knuckled mystery I have changed my entire outlook on life!In fact, after looking at the Oscar Nominations from 1991, I am officially taken aback that Point Break was not nominated for anything! Even Keanu "Whoa" Reeves has raised the water mark for great acting in a thriller (William Shatner notwithstanding).Each line of dialogue, each gratuitous booby shot, each bullet fired, and each bloodied nose fits together so perfectly, much like a fine Arthurian Tapestry to tell this story worthy not only of an Oscar (or nine) but of true legendary status. Many will quote Citizen Kane, Gone With The Wind, My Left Foot, Caveman, or The Godfather as the best films of all time. For me, however, it is unquestionably Point Break! If I may venture a guess I would state that in years to come audiences will rediscover Point Break, and will embrace it (much as they have rediscovered and embraced Jade starring David Caruso). In the future Point Break will be taught in film schools, and the script will be anthologized in College American Literature surveys. Swayze Hair will come back into style, and kids everywhere will go as FBI Agent Ben Harp to Halloween Parties from coast to coast. One day, Brian DePalma will make all of his movies into homages to the great Point Break and all of us will see the socio-political ramifications of this brilliant gem of theater. If you have not yet seen Point Break, do so. Run, do not walk to the finest video store in town, plunk down your $2.99 and be prepared to laugh, to cry, and to long for a sequel ("The Revenge of Bodhi" anyone?).Point Break is a true American Artifact... now and forever! Thank you and God Bless!</fullReview>

But for those of us who can identify with the feeling of wanting more from life than their cars on the freeway going to and from work, this movie is a must.The story is about a young FBI agent and his transfer to the LA FBI bank robbery division. Jonny Utah (K. Reeves) meets up with an Oscar-worthy Gary Busey as his older and wiser partner. They seek the unbustable Dead Presidents, an bank robbery gang that leaves no clues, no trace..."-and like that (SNAP) they disappear, like a virgin on prom night." -Gary Busey's character Angleo PapisThats all I will tell you about, with the execption that this is a great movie that you should see 1,000 times.</fullReview>

In every movie she directs be it "Near Dark","Strange Days","Blue Steel" or "Point Break" you are definitely in for a visual treat. The movie is awesome and not even Keanu screwed it up. I found myself rooting for Bodhi throughout the movie and not the F.B.I. agent. The movie has a great supporting cast like Lori Petty,Gary Busey and so forth. It really is a fun movie to watch and is very entertaining. It also has a great skydiving sequence. Highly reccomended.</fullReview>

Patrick Swayze's performance is great with him playing the spiritual, rush addicted surfer. The other great performance is by Keanu Reeves who provides a lot by playing the quarterback punk rookie cop. The whole movie just has so much with sky diving scenes and of course the superb surfing scenes. It's no wonder this movie was such a big hit. I highly recommend renting it or better yet buying it.

		<fullReview>Lets just start out right here by saying I am a fan of Keanu. I own Speed, I saw The Matrix, but hey, Keanu has had bad roles (can you say Johnny Mnemonic or however you spell that). This is one of his pretty awesome movies. You start out with him and Swayze, thats a great start already. Then you add action, surfing, robberies, sky diving, and more. When that all adds up, you got a chock full o' good stuff, and that adds up to a great movie. But then this movie also has its downsides. Some of surfing scenes could have been taken away and still had an awesome movie. I really liked the idea of the ex-presidents, and I laughed at the back picture of Nixon shooting someone, maybe I have an odd sense of humor. Well, this is a great movie, but doesn't live up to Heat. Overall though, this movie gets a 8/10, and that is pretty good. This movie is rated R for language, violence, sex, and a short scene of nudity. I would say that most 15+ teens could handle it. It is a great movie, and I suggest you see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Utah, the most despicable villain of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the first 10 minutes I thought it's gonna be like John Woo's The Killer mixed with Lethal Weapon. Later, Keanu Reeves' painful performance really made me wonder what the crap were all the makers thinking when they made this. Half way through the movie I thought maybe this movie's about sociopath robbers going down, and then again Keanu's Johnny Utah made every character in the movie more lovable including all the villains. So maybe somebody can tell me if this movie really is an action flick or a blatant comedy.Simply put, there's not a single scene with Keanu that didn't blow. All the compliments the other characters spewed on him are like praising a squirrel that it's got Kim Basinger's body and Mona Lisa's smile. His expressions and reactions to all the people alike really made me want to punch the hairspray off his head. Do I have to mention what a bad cop Johnny Utah is? So he was undercover, and he got into this magical friendship and romance with the wrong people without any character development. Remember, it's "magical" because everyone's naturally charmed by him no matter what, a bit like Beth in the Twillight series... So as the story goes on and on, he further dragged us the audiences into his world of miseries. But, don't worry, all you need to do is to look at his non-chute parachuting and robotic charming face. Maybe it's the problem with writing, or maybe it's Keanu's performance was so bad they had to write the whole story into a farce. Anyway, seeing Johnny Utah swearing profanities and blowing everyone around really made me realized it's not about Cops beating bad guys, neither is it about bad guys triumphing over good cops. It's a legendary portrait of the most memorable villain of all the time--Johnny Utah! Anyone found the joker in the Dark Knight frightening better go and check this fellow out. He promised to blow you away! Enough sarcastic talk. Point Break was mainly marketed as an action flick with extreme sports as a sub-plot. What dragged its legs are Keanu, the lame conflict development and character study. The late Patrick Swayze really showed much potential in the character of Bhodi. He definitely could have been a very complicated character that made audiences' heart bleed for him, except he didn't. The tensions built around several core threads and characters also were found effect-less. For instance, how many of you believed Bodhi would really gut his girl? Good, now hands down and send a thanks letter to the director(who's really famous by now). However, if you aim for muscles, nudists, idiots with muscles etc, Point Break is for you.P.S. The scene in which Keanu shot in the sky while letting Swayze go wasn't so touching as referred in "Hot Fuzz". One can definitely attribute that to special agent Johnny Utah's incompetency.5/10. See it for trivial reasons instead for actions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike HEAT and many other modern Bank Robbery or Heist films that include a "nerd" to disarm the Security System or Cameras, this keeps it "Old School". The last of it's kind. This Movie, to me, shows the most notorious Bank Robber Gang ever. THE EX PRESIDENTS."Baldwin's" THE GETAWAY had the Micheal Myers Gang, The DEAD PRESIDENTS had the Mime Gang, HEAT had the Jason Gang, but these guys had the best outfits. And talk about Professionalism; The Reservior Dogs nor Keyser Soze's crew would be able to pull a job faster than these guys. Only one man was able to stop these guys. NEO.Kathryn Bigelow, the best!, directs this spectacular story of friendship and honor that is told during a classic cops and robbers plot. Two guys meet and bond forever knowing who each other is. Like an Asian Movie, these guys are on opposite sides of the Law, but somehow can't stop holding on to each other like brothers.Gary Busy and Lori Petty make memorable performances as well.Beautiful, action packed, cop flick.Again, the last of it's kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before he made trench coats cool again in "The Matrix", Keanu Reeves had made the early Nineties surfer dude something of a trademark of his. Given that he was primarily known as being the tall one from "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure", it must have been a tough decision to graduate from teen comedy to adult action thriller. However, instead of proving to be his finest hour, Reeves buries the memory of the time-travelling twosome by introducing the world to what he is now primarily known as - Robot Reeves. Having said that, this wasn't quite as dated as I'd expected.Reeves plays the unlikely-named Johnny Utah, a clean-cut FBI agent assigned to southern California to investigate a bunch of professional bank robbers called the Ex-Presidents. Teaming up with FBI veteran Angelo Pappas (Gary Busey), they believe the robbers are actually surfers and Johnny goes undercover in order to infiltrate the community. Before long, he meets Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) who seems prepared to go to any lengths in order to secure the ultimate high. Is Bodhi really all that he seems and can Utah and Pappas crack the case without breaking Utah's cover? With one fell swoop, Keanu goes from goofy teen to stoic adult and destroys any hint of emotion on his face. He is astonishingly wooden, especially next to Swayze who seems to be having the time of his life. Reeves also maintains his track record of saying "Whoa" in every movie he's ever been in. To be frank, if Reeves were a better actor then "Point Break" might have actually been a much better movie instead of just a good one. It certainly looks fantastic. The surfing and sky-diving scenes are something special, even if there are times when credibility is stretched to the limit. The supporting cast are also admirable with able turns from Lori Petty as the love interest and John C McGinley as their irritable boss. But Swayze runs off with the picture, although his hippy-surfer character feels as solid a cliché as you can imagine. Come to think of it, there is nothing about this movie which strikes me as being original or wildly imaginative. If ever a film was a product of its time then surely this is it.Like I said at the start, I was expecting this movie to be horribly dated and full of sub-"Wayne's World" dialogue but in actual fact, this remains a pretty watchable film. The emotionless slab that is Reeves is forgotten as you're lost in a literal sea of adventure, adrenaline (the sky-diving scenes are vertigo-inducing, at times) and action. It's not the best film but it's fun to watch in a switch-your-brain-off-dude way. It's also good to see perma-baddie Busey play a good guy for once. So in short, it's nowt special but a pleasant enough way to waste some time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>better than it has any right to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a real archetypal dumb 90s action movie, but it happens to be an above average one. I couldn't believe how long I watched this on TV, but it goes to show how so little can make for so much on a Saturday afternoon. The term guilty pleasure first springs to mind, especially the moment when Gary Busey tells his young new partner, Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves), that the people they're after- a group of bank robbers taking a signature of wearing President masks- may also be surfers. It's kind of like a movie made specifically for someone who loves the Bruckheimer movies of the late 80s, with the slick, empty-headed, shallow appeal that went with the action, humor, and almost plastic action stars and occasional good actors, only for also for someone into feeling the need for, uh, waves. But somehow, director Kathryn Bigelow pulls it off for more than just its target bubble-headed group. It is as smart as its trying to be, and as fun as a noisy, violent R-rated action picture can get.Reeves, of course, is still in the form of getting his real star presence together, in the kind of role he would make much better with Speed and in of course in the Matrix, as a hot shot with as much ambition as (in Reeves fashion) charisma as he infiltrates the tight ring of surfers, led by Patrick Swayze and the pretty Lori Petty. As he gets better at surfing and gets closer in with this group, with Swayze's "Bodhissatva" taking surfing as much of a spiritual experience as with his bank robbing. After a stumble in busting a group of nasties (led hilariously by the Red Hot Chili Peppers in a get-up), Reeves gets closer, too close, and it comes very tense as both sides play each other to the finish- a near show-stopping bank robbing climax. A lot of this- one might say almost all of it- isn't new. John C. McGinley's scenes ring off of every other scene where a lead sergeant or other gets mad as hell at his underlings. The sneak-side of Reeves with Swayze and especially Petty have been seen in more B movies (especially biker ones I've seen) than I care to count. And sometimes the humor is way too 'hip' for its own good.But after a while I didn't care about a lot of that and just enjoyed what cool-side and attitude came with the material. There's even a sense that the filmmakers and actors know what kind of project this is to the fullest and between their serious takes- sometimes a little cringing to see (the 'drama' that unfolds with Utah and his female counterpart is a bit too stale)- there were a lot of grins and laughs all the way. Some of the best (dumb) fun to have from 1991.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I understand that Keanu Reeves is an awful actor and Patrick Swayze isn't that great either, but it's got BUSEY for Christ's sake. Gary Busey is hilarious in it. "Utah, gimme two!" This is perhaps the greatest and the worst movie ever made. While the acting falls short of bearable, the performances mark the "breaking point" between cheesy eighties films and the early nineties, bringing Keanu into a new decade to make fabulous films like "A Walk in the Clouds" and "Johnny Mnemonic." However, how could you not LOVE a movie that has COPS, ROBBERS, SURFING, SEX, DRUGS, ROCK AND ROLL, SKYDIVING, PARTIES, CHASE SCENES, AND BUSEY all rolled into one, not to mention "Johnny F--in Utah, number nine, oh, Jesus Christ, Johnny F--in Utah, I'm sorry man." The opening scene reveals that the movie is going to be the best and the worst movie ever made, as Bodhi and Utah are being compared in their expertise as Utah flawlessly completes an FBI test, while Bohdi thrashes waves like no other in history. While the comparison and contrast is cheesy enough to ruin most movies, it also reveals how badassed "Point Break" is going to be.So, whoever denies that "Point Break" is on every top five list ever made, whether it be "Top Five Best Movies," "Top Five Worst Movies," or "Top Five Movies with Lori Petty about Surfers and FBI Agents Who Become Friends and then Have to Betray Each Other Because Of Circumstances," is a complete, pompous fool who thinks that he/she knows too much bullcrap about artsy movies that are not 100% adrenaline and bad-acting, excepting BUSEY!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that "Point Break" has always been dismissed as a typical action flick, with Keanu Reeves appropiately playing an FBI agent undercover as a surfer, it does sounds pretty lame. Well, "Point Break" is far from lame, it is actually one of the best action films ever made.Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, "Point Break" is highly underrated. I think because of when it came out, and the fact that alot of people just can't take Keanu Reeves seriously, its too bad because this is a very exciting film, a film that has a feel to it, a very resonate and distinguishable vibe. "Point Break" is one of a handful of films that I can watch over and over again, and one of maybe 2 or 3 that I can actually fall asleep to, in a good way of course. From Keanu to John C. Mcginley, everyone is perfectly cast. The action sequences are taunt and original, especially the foot chase through houses and backyards, with Keanu hoofing a pitbull. The relationships seem real and believable, especially Keanu and Swayze, in the hands of lesser directors it all could of seemed silly and homoerotic, like "Top Gun", but although this is very much a macho film (as Lori Petty's character states "there is too much testosterone here") it has an understanding to it, all these guys, from the FBI to the bank robbers are all in it for the adreneline rush, the thing that makes them feel like men, that makes them feel alive.You know a film is great when it is often copied but never duplicated, like "Die Hard" or "Pulp Fiction". "Point Break" has been copied many times, most recently in the form of "The Fast and the Furious" but nothing has compared to it, it stands alone, like the mystique placed on surfing in the film, "Point Break" has a mystique, its spiritual, Its a way of life, "dude".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plainly one of the best movies I have ever seen. This film has got it all: surf, action, decent plot, and Lori Petty.!!!. I'd never seen her act before I saw this, but I watched and enjoyed Lori, and the Guy's and I was totally entertained. There is a solid plot, good acting, and it kept me watching throughout. I was at no point tempted to switch over or off (first seen on T.V.). If you have not seen it do-so cos' it's wonderful. I liked it so much that after seeing it I bought the video!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not often that a film like this comes along. Point Break is a great film that takes you on the journey of the characters. Jonny Utah (Reeves) is a rookie undercover FBI agent searching for a group of bank robbers called 'The Ex Presidents' suspected to be surfers. He gets in with a group of surfers and meets an adrenaline junkie called Bohdi (Swayze) who is a really spiritual soul searching for that ultimate ride. This film follows his investigation and his relationship with Bodhi whom he admires for what he represents.This is Reeves and the late and great Patrick Swayze at their best! A fantastic, adrenaline pumping action film with a real sense of spirituality including breath-taking scenes!10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quite possibly the most idiotic movie I have ever seen. I actually lost about 50 IQ points just watching the trailer for this hunk of crap. The plot is so contrived and full of holes that I wonder if the editor(s) actually read the screenplay. I would like to say that the acting in this film is bad but there is no acting, just over-acting. The real tragedy is that the basic story line of "Point Break" is similar to Kem Nunn's outstanding early 1980's novel "Tapping the Source" which I believe would make an excellent film. If you have never seen "Point Break" avoid it at all costs...unless of course you have a root-canal coming up</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think point break is so much a bad movie as a movie that will appeal to certain people and have no cross over appeal. I have not been able to get into this no matter how hard I tried(and have tried more then once). It mostly did not make a strong impression on me, and though I liked some of the scenery that's a s far as I can go in terms of interest level.I had originally not wanted to see this when it came out, I saw the advertisements for it and seeing the men in the air, flapping it just looked silly.One thing I will comment on is the scenery and I think that's why I wanted to adore the movie as well. But I didn't find much of what I like in movies present in this one. Although I will say there are some movies I wont watch a second or third time and this is one I am keeping an open mind about.I guess, as far as action goes point break sure has it. I am a Swayze fan to and as mentioned the visuals are great but other then those things I have never been able to get into it. Good movie for some, but one of the few Swayse movies I found completely missable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2 bad actors make a bad movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was not a bad idea for a film and could have been really interesting. The problem was the actors that were used. Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze have been in some really bad films with the acting as sub-par. Put them both in the same film together and you get a film that is twice as bad as the ones they did by themselves. So anyway what do we have here? A bunch of surfers who rob banks during the day and hang out at the beach and surf on their free time. Keanu Reeves plays some cop that goes undercover to catch these guys and becomes a surfer himself. Pretty much a predictable film with the kind of action you would expect. Do the surfers get caught? Does Reeves and Swayze become friends? Does Reeves doubt he can still be a cop at the end? Does Swayze die at the end trying to surf a huge wave? Are there stars in the sky? You get my point here. But I will say it was fun to see how two bad actors worked together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beach Blanket Bank Robbery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rash of quick, organized bank jobs in California leads a rookie Fed (named Johnny Utah!) to the beaches as an undercover surfer to ferret out the curl-shooting criminals. An asinine script is at least partnered with an intrinsically exciting director (Kathryn Bigelow) who gets the action pumping even when the material is bogus. Keanu Reeves is alternately placid and over-eager as the agent who befriends surfing guru Patrick Swayze, however both actors manage not to embarrass themselves (they're cartoonish instead of wooden, which is amazing considering these are not characters, they're writer's clichés). Director Bigelow must be attracted to movies with blow hard desk sergeants who do nothing but bellow at their underlings (the Feds in this flick are just as ridiculous as the cops in "Blue Steel"), and she isn't kind to the one main woman in the cast (Lori Petty, whose sass initially substitutes for a character--until she's turned into a victim). Gary Busey does wonders in another clichéd role, that of the crusty veteran saddled with the young upstart, and the surfing footage is very good, but "Point Blank" is merely watchable instead of incredible, and is about as plausible as an episode of "Scooby Doo". **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most overrated action films I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Point Break" was named a hugely clever satire of male testosterone in my "Films of the '90s" book (edited by Jurgen Muller). They claimed it was one of the finest films of the decade and placed it in their book of must-see '90s films, leaving out classics such as "Reservoir Dogs" and "Dumb and Dumber" (yep, I'm joking about that one, but still). I couldn't believe what I was reading, and thought to myself, "Maybe I should see it again." I vaguely recalled being disappointed in the film on first viewing years and years ago but nonetheless I decided to give it a second chance, taking into account the fact that it was a supposed tongue-in-cheek satire of male action flicks.Sadly, I only hated it even more. This has to be one of the most pretentious, stupid, poorly acted and written action movies of the 1990s. It would be fairly enjoyable as a no-brainer if not for the fact that it has gained some sort of reputation for being a "classic." In my opinion, it is not a classic by any means. First of all, Kathryn Bigelow (James Cameron's ex-wife) falls victim to her excessive styling again (later to be seen to an even greater extent in the bloated "Strange Days" in 1995). The movie is too over-the-top. Paul Verhoeven found a good way to balance satire and excess in "RoboCop"; "Point Break" shifts the weight and topples over into the realm of such Verhoeven errors as "Starship Troopers" and "Showgirls." It's got that same sort of odd, over-done vibe seeing through every frame -- bright, vibrant colors, loud trashy music, and tons of gratuitous action, sex and violence.Keanu Reeves is one of the worst actors of all time. He redeemed himself (somewhat) in Gus Vant Sant's "My Own Private Idaho" in 1991 and then released this and totally negated his Shakespeare-adaptation efforts. His performance in "Point Break," as an undercover cop, is laughably poor.Patrick Swayze delivers the most memorable performance, but -- and get this! -- his character's name is a reference to Buddhism, as if the film is trying to somehow subtly imply he is like a Buddhist god. The problem is, it's not subtle at all; especially considering the fact that they explain the meaning of his name in the film.The action is poorly staged (or mediocre, anyway) and Bigelow's trademark hand-held shots grow tiresome (such as the overlong foot chase). The film is alright but then the ending goes on for too long (just like "Strange Days") and worsens, leaving a sour aftertaste. It doesn't know when to finish, nor does it realize that satire is savored best when it is less than obvious.A huge disappointment, and one of the most overrated action films (or so-called "satires") I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I should. The story is a bit everywhere, from robbery to young love to adrenaline-inducing scenes of police chases and extreme sports.Keanu Reeves definitely shined bright in this film, although it's a bit difficult to forget his Bill and Ted demeanor when he starts talking in his "yeah dude" speak. The shots of surfing waves and beauty of the earth from 10000 feet up is amazing to watch and you can't help but feel the rush that the characters also do in the film. However, I feel that Keanu's motivation is a bit blurry (maybe it was intentional) as he sways between being a good cop and being an adrenaline junkie that Patrick Swayze was about. I didn't get it. I didn't get what he wanted to do. I didn't even get why he kept on following Patrick Swayze's whims even though he finds out that they were the robbers (this part is pretty expected).But from a Keanu fan, my oh my was he beautiful (still is).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You don't ever know what you truly have until it's taken away from you. It hits hard, especially when it occurs rather abruptly. Point Break certainly revolves around this central theme and how life is the totality of the individual moments that compose it. This film is certainly enjoyable. Whether it's Keanu Reeves with his moving dialogue or simply the iconic bank heist scenes; there's rarely a dull moment. From the chases to thrill-seeking adventures, this movie is high tempo and cycles through a myriad of emotions (although not very deeply). Beyond the pure entertainment value, there isn't much going on. The acting is subpar at best and the plot is fairly weak. Nonetheless, if you're looking to enjoy yourself, Point Break is a solid option.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Utah (from Ohio, so there's confusion right there) is a rookie EFF BEE AYE Agent transferred to his first gig in Los Angeles much to the disappointment of his stuck-up boss Ben Harp, who seems to have forgotten how to crack a case despite being about only 31. Even more disappointed is his new partner - jaded burnout Angelo Pappas. No one seems to have any faith in Utah even though he's taking it all seriously.Their first case together is the pursuit of the Ex-Presidents, a gang of ironic bank robbers who pull-off 60-second robberies to fund their hedonistic lifestyle. Pappas just wants to let it go, but Utah's energy reinvigorates him and they go undercover in the LA surf scene where Utah meets boyish, unattractive Tyler who teaches him how to ride a wave and introduces him to Bohdi and his gang of easy-going pals.I'm not going to lie, Point Break has its problems. Keanu's acting is bad, not as bad as he is in Speed, but still bad, and totally one-note. He even somehow manages to gradually turn Johnny Utah into Ted "Theodore" Logan by the end. Lori Petty is completely mis-cast as Tyler and far, far too mannish for the role. There's also practically no mystery as to who the Ex-Presidents really are since Swayze's voice is recognizable from the very beginning.The action, surf photography (shot in fake Super-35 widescreen), and occasional atmosphere make up for it. Not to mention anything with Gary Busey is worthwhile and he barely keeps himself in check, playing Pappas with his usual manic energy. The centerpiece of the whole movie is without a doubt the skydiving scene, which is beautifully breathtaking. Mark Isham's score for this scene is simply wonderful, and, as a teenager, I would watch this scene over and over to the point where the VHS tape eventually got worn-out.Point Break has gone on to be a cult classic inspiring rip-offs such as The Fast and the Furious (and a soon-to-be unnecessary remake that no one wants starring box office poison Gerard Butler) and a spoof stage show. Kathryn Bigelow, who was one of James Cameron's many wives at the time, has only made 5 films since 1991 which is strange for a director so solid with a near-perfect track record. Even her worst films have merit, though she did go on to win big with The Hurt Locker in 2009.It may be soaking in early 90s surf culture, but that's the only thing that dates it and any remake, re-imagining, reboots, or re-interpretation is not needed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, watching this movie you would know why they are so critical about Keanu Reeve's acting skills. Though I don't have much appreciation for his performance, I must commend on his choice of movies. Not this one though. If you love adventure sports especially surfing, and consider heist jobs to be the most intelligent course of human mind, you are going to love this movie. It has surfers, sky-divers, bank robbers and FBI agents. Point Break has everything for the suckers of adrenaline rush, but nothing much for sensible minds. There is no chemistry between the actors whatsoever. Patrick Swayze's free-spirited performance would make you want to be like Bodhi. Some of his utterances are prophetic for the young and restless. Visuals are stunning, and that's about it. When the man and woman (Cameron and Bigelow) were together, they created this one. All I can say that I don't share Bigelow's cinematic view. This could have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Action/Dialogue, But Missing Moral Questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An amazing concept, and beautifully executed by all involved. The writer and the director used soul and passion to create a memorable experience. Patrick Swayze shined to the point of brilliance as a charismatic surfing guru with a lack of moral compunction.The chase scene will endure as an example of pure adrenaline, and the battle between one man's obsession with freedom and another's desire to capture him.I am not exactly sure why they chose a short-haired, flat-chested actress for the female lead. I suppose it may take a tomboy to be a surfer.I have read opinions that there was some kind of underlying homosexuality related to the Keanu Reeve's character's relationships with both the tomboy, and the Swayze character. I didn't pick up on that. But I think the movie would have been sexier with a more voluptous female lead, who wasn't a surfer.My one criticism has to do with a lack of dialogue about morality. Swayze gives an impressive and memorable speech about the joys of bank robbing and the corollary feeling of power, but someone should have asked his character if he ever felt guilty about terrorizing innocent people and stealing their money.The ending was epic, if predictable. I loved this movie despite any comic-book aspects, or perhaps because of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the coastal town of Los Angeles, a gang of bank robbers calling themselves the ex- presidents, commit their crimes while wearing masks of presidents Reagan, Carter, Nixon and Johnson. The F.B.I. believes that the members of the gang could be surfers and send young agent Johnny Utah undercover at the beach to mix with the surfers and gather information. Utah meets surfer Bodhi and gets drawn into the lifestyle of his new friend......Its a Simone premise, undercover agent gets too involved with person he is tracking and starts to question his priorities. But no one has made the film in the bohemian style like Bigelow has done here.It's effortlessly cool from beginning to end, and the filming styles make this something beyond the thriller it is. When we first meet Utah, the film feels cold and steel like, and then we meet Bodhi, the warmth of the film starts to integrate with the cold feel of Utahs story, hence the two stars names morphing together during the opening.As Utah opens up more, and realises that his life choices were not necessarily the ones he wanted, the film becomes brighter and more warmer, I mean, the films final skydive ends in the desert. And when we get to the year later scene, it's back to the coldness of the original.Other than that, it's an epic piece of cinema, from the opening robbery, to the poetic skydives, right up to the phenomenal foot chase through the houses.Swayze was never better, and he owned this role, Reeves is Reeves, but its one of those movies that never gets boring, and certainly doesn't feel like its 23 years old.Please, do not remake this with Gerard Butler!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ultimate buddy movie? POINT BREAK comes close. Few films can offer the same kind of male bonding found here, as two men on opposite sides of the law find themselves growing close thanks to a shared world view.On the one side is greenhorn Keanu Reeves, playing FBI agent/slacker Johnny Utah, in possibly his blandest performance ever (it doesn't help that his character is extremely dim-witted to the extent that a bank robbery takes place behind him while he's ordering takeaway). On the other is Patrick Swayze as Bodhi, giving nothing less than an iconic performance as the surfer/extreme sports fan/bank robber extraordinaire. Swayze doesn't say much here, but his performance is all in his eyes, which seem full of an intense sadness at times. It's the kind of turn that makes you sit up and take note.Elsewhere, the film has highs and lows. The story isn't the most gripping and there's a little too much of the surfing for my liking. It does pick up later on, though, and boasts an absolutely amazing foot chase that I later had to watch a second time just to remind myself how great it was. The supporting cast is so-so, but the film wins merit for the casting of Gary Busey as Reeves' partner; it's great to see Busey on the side of good for once, and he gives a typically intense, scene-chewing turn that I loved to bits. The action stuff, when it comes, is well handled too, with director Bigelow injecting some of her trademark tension into the proceedings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surfer action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1991, "Point Break" stars Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze, Gary Busey and Lori Petty. Reeves is FBI agent "Johnny Utah" - how's that for a name - who teams up with Busey to find bank robbers who have robbed something like 30 banks. The robbers wear presidential masks - Reagan, Nixon, that crowd. After watching the tapes of the robbery, it's concluded that these guys are surfers. Reeves goes in to learn not only surfing, but the surfing culture, to see if he can figure out who the robbing surfers are.I found this film overly long, and it's really one that needs to be seen on the big screen because of the tremendous scenes of surfing and sky diving, which looked magnificent. There is also a remarkable chase scene where Reeves chases the dude with the President Reagan mask.Patrick Swayze is very good as Bodhi, a surfer who lives for the adrenaline rush, and Gary Busey is believable as Reeves' partner. For the most part, however, the acting is unimpressive. Keanu Reeves is deliciously handsome, but I've never believed a word he says in any film. To me, he's just not a very good actor, nor is Lori Petty, who plays his connection into the surfer world. There's something hollow and external about both performances.If you have a big screen TV, you should enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a stylish action movie by Kathryn Bigelow, wife of action director James Cameron. The plot is dumb, but unlike most action movies of the 90s, this one has aged quite well.Pros:1. One of the greatest foot chases ever filmed 2. Some nice surfing footage 3. Some pretty good action scenes 4. Zen surfers 5. Gary Bursey, the Bill Paxton of his generation. 6. Patrick Swayze plays a memorable bad guy. He's an extreme sports loving mystical Buddhist surf guru. Sweet.7. Unlike most bad guys, Swayze earns our sympathy.8. Gratuitous nudity. Remember when summer action movies actually tried to get an R rating?9. Some nice beach ambiance. The crackling beach fires, the night time shots of the beaches, the sound of the lapping waves. It's all very cosy. The film captures the tone and ambiance of the surfer lifestyle. 10. A memorable finale.Cons:1. The film fetishizes its surfing and sports footage. At times this gets overbearing. 2. As with most 90s action movies, the film is pretty dumb. 3. Very cheesy. 4. The X-TREME attitude and footage is at times hard to take seriously.5. The film pretends to be about "action junkies" who "accept peace and Buddhism" (the director sees herself as a subversive action director, undermining male ego and male macho posturing) but its aesthetics and tone constantly undermine this message.6. The film pretends to be "Anti-James Cameron" when it actually formally aligns itself with him.7/10 - Not as great as Keanu's "Speed" and "The Matrix", but still, it's pretty fun. Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Special Agent Johnny Utah is a former college football star who suffered an injury that prevented him from ever fully realizing his dream. Now a federal agent out on the west coast, he's transferred to a robbery division that's run by an obstinate, by the book agent who isn't impressed in the least bit by his new subordinate. Utah is paired with a maverick veteran to investigate a series of 'perfect' bank robberies, and infiltrates a gang of suspicious surfers led by a rogue daredevil who may be the brains behind the operation. Action-heist film certainly works on a no-brainer level with great stunts, scenery, and gimmicky action scenes, but in terms of realism, story, or character, it's laughable at best. The cast is good though, and undiscriminating movie fans may absolutely love it. **</fullReview>

I am a couple weeks shy of 50 and just watched it again tonight. Keanu Reeves holds his own, and then some. Critically speaking, a few scenes are pretty bad (to me they are bad, like 'F___, why can't I say what I really mean!, or 'Man, this is harder then I thought',etc, etc). Pretty corny stuff. But, that's just a very small portion of the movie. Mostly, he (K.R.)does just fine. Patrick Swayze is great!

Each character is developed so well and it feels like you can place yourself in their shoes at all times. The plot is excellent and completely original, and it is also very realistic (I do not see how other's claim its very unrealistic?) Even if viewers do not like Surfing or cops/robbers movies, they can still LOVE this movie because it has 5 different genres inside the "action/adventure" genre. Point Break has multiple gun fighting , surfing,and sky-diving scenes that can please anyone. I suggest that anybody reading this, who has not seen it yet, takes a look at the film and hopefully will get the same impression that I did. On a side note, Beyond The Law is VERY similar to this and is also another great movie worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A long haired Patrick Swayze and a young Keanu Reeves team up as two fun-loving surfer boys, but what Bodhi (Swayze) doesn't know, is that Johnny Utah (Reeves) is actually an undercover cop looking for big time bank robbers, who just so happen to include himself! As the story unfolds and Johnny Utah gets caught up in it accidentally and emotionally, there is more at stake than he ever imagined. Not only does Bodhi teach him how to 'live', but he also gets him in hot water on numerous occasions. Some excellent photography in some scenes (you'll understand when/if you see it), plus, there's plenty of Swayze and Reeves' flesh!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has it all. Theft, surfing, skydiving and cheesy love. You will take off your tie and head to the beach. Reeves is probably the worst actor I've seen, but his role in this film works. When this movie came out I was too young to know what was going on. But now it's on TBS all the time, and people are starting to see what they missed out on in 1991. It has a mild political undertone, like a slow rage against the machine song. Richard Nixon and LBJ are robbing banks and wearing tuxedos! If I was cool enough in 91' to have seen this movie, I would have been one of the characters for Halloween. After you see it you will know what I mean!</fullReview>

And does anyone else think that this movie --- despite a somewhat lackluster performance at the box office and overlooking those few traces of B-level cheesiness --- is one of the greatest films ever created, in the vast history of American cinema? I mean, I'm talking right up there with the likes of Shawshank, The Godfather Pt.2, Return of the Jedi, and Braveheart, my friends! So, (and somehow I doubt that this ever happens) if there's anyone else out there just surfing the web, or even a regular contributor on this board, who truly understands and appreciates what this one movie did to help shape the landscape of present-day cinema (well, kinda-sorta), please, give me a shout!

		<fullReview>Kathryn Bigelow's "Point Break" is a movie that packs a lot of action. In fact, it was a nice surprise to discover. Not ever having seen it when it was released, we took a chance that paid off well. This is the perfect escape movie that is easy on the eye, as it is on the mind. The plot, although not perfect, keeps the viewer glued to the screen, especially during the surfing and skydiving sequences that are amazing.This was a Patrick Swayze vehicle, where a young Keanu Reeves practically steals the picture from him. As the FBI undercover agent Johnny Utah, Mr. Reeves gives an outstanding performance. Mr. Swayze is Bodhi, the evil man looking for the perfect wave. In order to survive, doing nothing, Bohdi and his surfer friends rob banks in California. This only happens during the time they spend time riding the waves near the L.A. beaches. FBI agent, Angelo Pappas, who is Utah's partner has a theory about who are the guys involved in the robberies. All seem to point they are surfers.Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves are good. The supporting cast also, responds well to Ms. Bigelow's direction. Gary Busey, James LeGros, Lori Petri, among the large supporting cast excel.The film will not disappoint the fans of action movies as some incredible things are done with the surfing and skydiving stunts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FBI Agent Johnny Utah (Keanue Reeves) is transferred to California and partnered with FBI Agent Angelo Pappas (Gary Busey). The California department have been trying to break the case of a string of bank robberies committed by four people who wear rubber masks of four ex-presidents.Agenct Pappas has this theory that the robbers are surfers because the bank robberies only take place during surfing season. The rest of the FBI office makes fun of his theory, but Utah decides that it wouldn't hurt to learn to surf "on his own time".Utah (meets Tyler Ann Endicott and she teaches him to surf. Utah makes friends with a group of surfers that Patrick Swayze (Bodhi) is part of. Bodhi keeps encouraging Utah to go for a bigger wave and to do other exciting things. Utah gets beat up by some tough-guy surfers on a different beach and Bodhi comes to his rescue.Utah tells Pappas about this bad-ass group of surfers. Then Johnny Utah is busy trying to surf and keep track of this bad group of surfers. Good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>soul surfing on film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie is a work of art,through Swayze s character, bod hi it speaks about the soul surfing and spiritual bonds between soul surfers and ocean. I live in Croatia where waves are basically too small for surfing so surfing has not developed into a popular sport here,there are no surf shops and besides myself I have never met anyone who's into soul surfing and everything about it.Not being able to surf here I have spent last 5 years learning about surf culture and history reading magazine articles searching the net about surfing, trying to find movies about surfing...For me, and for any other surfer there is no such a thing as a bad movie about surfing.If it speaks about it, if there are scenes of surfing ...its good enough for me, but Point Break was really great. Compliments for the director,I thing that timing was great,every death on this movie was timed perfectly,roach, Nathaniel and grommet were great and the lines are amazing.I especially liked that silent spiritual music while Bodhi surfed and Tyler talked about him. Anyway what I wanted to say is that I watched this movie for more than 500 times now and for me, the only Croatian surf stoked loner its kind of comforting to hope that somewhere on the beaches of L.A. there are groups of surfers just like Bodhi and guys(except for robbing banks part),soul surfers who live for riding waves and dream of next awakening of senses they'll experience in ocean.It also makes me sad that this movie isn't reality cause I really think they made Bodhi great,I really have found myself in him and it would be great to be in his crew.My question is , if anyone who's reading this is from California, is how are surfers there, are soul surfers majority, and are there any gays like Bodhi?I'm coming to Cali next school year to be a senior on a high school exchange program(Face the world foundation)but I'm not sure exactly where in Cali cause they haven't found host family yet but I'm hoping for Huntington Beach,I don't know why but that town is my very favorite place in the world. My references to you are to watch In Gods Hands,I think it has the best film music ever and in my opinion it (next to point break of course)best movie ever.GREETINGS BROTHERS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watched this movie for the second time last night and I have to say that it ROCKS! It is so much more than an action movie. It is about trying to find your own personal freedom whilst battling against a system that, despite the many freedoms it provides, still tries to keep you on a tight leash. It is about the never ending struggle of good vs. evil. The end scenes being a total moral dilemma for Johnny. What would you do if you were him? Also it is about one mans love for another woman. He goes against everything he believes to be right in order to stay with her. I mean, he jumps out of a plane without a parachute in order to save her!!!. Now that is true love!! Who wouldn't love someone who did that? I know that this comment might sound a bit fluffy but hey, I'm a girl - what more can I say!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect summer action movie; 100% pure adrenalin rush - "Point Break"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(I'm a little late reviewing this movie, since the last time I watched it was in August of 2004 and had originally planned this summary after I viewed the film, but somehow never got around to it. So now I'm here with it.)Going into Kathryn Bigelow's 1991 action movie, "Point Break," starring Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves, one might be tempted to consider the question: How's this any different from the hundreds of action movies we've already seen? Well, not much, honestly. But its worthiness lies in the ideas and Buddhist philosophies that dominate the characters and dialogue, not the action and surfing scenes. But of course Buddhism plays a major role in the underlying message of the film, thus providing the audience with the line "Peace through superior firepower."Reeves stars as Johnny Utah, a recent Quantico-graduate who's transferred to the bank robbery division of the Los Angeles branch of the F.B.I. For years, the city has been plagued by a string of daring summertime robberies committed by a gang called the Ex-Presidents, who are known for dawning the rubber masks of Reagan, Carter, Nixon, and LBJ during their holdups.No clues, no trace evidence, nothing has been able to ever lead to an arrest much less identify who they are, but a grizzled veteran, Angelo Pappas (Gary Busey), has a theory: The Ex-Presidents are surfers. This claim receives the scorn and strident skepticism of his superiors, but Utah thinks that Pappas may be on to something, since the bureau obviously hasn't exhausted all of its resources yet. Since they only rob banks during the summer, this sparks the priceless line, "The Ex-Presidents rob banks to fund their endless summer!"Pappas suggests that Utah go undercover into the L.A. surfing subculture, which he comes to understand is a lot more than just "totally rad" or "tubular." And the idea of becoming one with the waves (those Buddhist teachings come out the woodwork around this time) and Bodhi (Swayze) introduces Utah to the underside of surfing.It shouldn't take Utah long to realize that Bodhi and his surfer buds are actually the Ex-Presidents, but then again, this isn't exactly the brightest action movie we've ever seen. Of course, "Point Break" has earned a cult status for its action scenes, philosophy, and its testosterone-driven plot and direction.One might be tempted to immediately think of this as a guy's movie, but when considering that it's directed by Bigelow (of "Near Dark" and "Blue Steel" fame) and James Cameron was the executive producer, this is one hell of an action flick.Reeves is wooden, as usual, but his blandness actually has some usefulness here, especially as he comes to realize many of Bodhi's teachings about nature and violence, and at the same is wooing Bodhi's girlfriend Tyler (Lori Petty). Swayze is an interesting character himself, being that I've never really seen him in a role where he is this restrained.But like I stated earlier, this is a perfect summer action movie, and it is 100% pure adrenalin.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok here we have a movie, starring Partrick Swayze and Keannu Reeves, two actors that had never really impressed me in any of their previous roles. BUT!!!!!, put the two together and it is a case of the whole being far greater than the sum of it's parts, as the performances from both are beleiveable and enjoyable. Reeves plays Utah, a fledgling FBI agent and all round clean cut joe. Utah is assigned a partner in the shape of Pappas, played by Gary Busey, and Buseys performance though brilliant gives us one of the age old cop movie clichés in the form of the youth versus experience partnership ie Dirty Harry, The Rookie, which to tell you the truth almost destroyed my interest in the movie almost as soon as it had begun. Pappas is already on the case of a spate of armed bank robberies committed by a group calling themsleves the Ex-Presidents, who disguise their identities by wearing masks of Reagan, Carter, Nixon and Johnson. Convinced that these criminals are in fact a group of surfers, Pappas pursuades Utah to go undercover at the beach as a would be surfer. He approaches a local female surfer and part time burger flipper Tyler (Lori Petty), and emotionally blackmails her into training him in the art of surfing. Through Tyler Utah falls in with a group of surfers headed up by the likable Bodhi (Swayze)a spiritual thrill seeker who's search for the ultimate ride sometimes unlodges his grip on the world around him. Utah and Bodhi hit it off straight away and start to become friends, though it doesn't take long before Utah is convinced Bodhi and his cohorts are the Ex-Presidents commiting the robberies. Brilliant film and the surfing and skydiving scenes are visually enchanting, and perfectly highlights the lengths that Bodhi and now Utah will travel for that ultimate ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You really have to take your hat off to Ms. Bigelow. She has created the best kept secret in movie history. Point Break is a chick flick.It is a homoerotic fantasy, where the main protagonists are pretty and there is a zen like message of peace running throughout. Don't get me wrong. I don't mind Point Break. But it is every girls favourite action film. The hero falls in love and tames a wild heart, while conquering his own fears of intimacy and ?Bodhi' (unfortunately not short for bodacious which would have been funny) the anti hero, who is never quite portrayed as the villain (although he participates in a few murders), takes the noble way out. He is a free spirit who can never be caged. He would rather die in a blaze of glory, doing what he loves, than go to jail.All these elements, and more, spell ladies action film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great action thriller from Bigelow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kathryn Bigelow's Point Break (1991) stars Keanu Reeves as a young FBI agent who gets undercover to the world of surfers as he and his partner think they may be responsible for many bank robberies that have taken place in recent times. Patrick Swayze plays one of the surfers whom with Reeves makes friends. This film has surprisingly firm plot and story and thus this becomes more interesting film than others in its genre. But the interesting and never-boring story is only one little positive thing this film has.The cinematography by Donald Peterman is totally stunning and rarely have I seen such a effective usage of slow motion and hyper stylish camera work in Hollywood picture. In fact, Point Break looks occasionally little like the greatest Hong Kong films with their unique use of camera and edits. Point Break has many surf scenes which look fantastic and the water almost seems to come inside your living room. The slow motion creates the feel of huge masses and power that lies in the ocean when nature decides to show its abilities. The other thing which is equally spectacular is the sky diving segment, which is very long and breath taking. It makes the viewer wonder "Why haven't I tried this fantastic sport yet?" Sky diving proves that these young guys want to be free and do what they want to, even if it may cost their lives. It required a lot from the cinematographer and director to make these scenes possible, and that shows how talented director Bigelow is and how talented crew she had. Her other films are no less visually stunning as Blue Steel (1990) and Near Dark (1987) show.The action is plentiful and fierce. Guns fire and people try to stay alive while bullets fly everywhere. There is one ultra fast chase involving Reeves and a criminal, and they run through several houses and backyards with such a speed that the ending of Hong Kong classic Long Arm of the Law (Johnny Mak, 1984) in the infamous Walled City with its claustrophobic elements came to my mind. It may well be that Bigelow is the Hollywood's closest equivalent to the Orient action and fantasy directors.This film, however, doesn't have the themes and philosophical touches which make especially Near Dark so wonderful. I can't say Point Break is empty, but it doesn't have many things to say despite these spectacular action segments which are more than plenty. The music is by Mark Isham (The Hitcher, Romeo Is Bleeding) and Bigelow's Near Dark wouldn't be so great without the music of Tangerine Dream so once again the importance of music and soundtrack has been proved. Point Break is among the greatest Hollywood produced action thrillers of the nineties and definitely makes it's director on the map in the history of action cinema. She is much more inventive and personal than many male directors, and I just hope she (and Antonia Bird) manage to continue their personal work for many years to come.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That classic quote could only have been delivered by that master thespian named Keanu Reeves. Johnny Utah might very well have been the seminel role in Reeves' well established career. Like most other Reeves films, this one was a box office success. Unlike other Reeves vehicles, however, this one does have some good qualities. The flow of the film is good and especially so during the bank robbery scenes as well as the classic chase scene. With Keanu chasing after the Ronald Reagan mask-wearing Swayze the scene cleverly takes us through a stunning car chase followed by an on-foot chase through residential L.A. I was of course being sarcastic regarding the master thespian issue, but this film really does deliver far better than "Speed," "Johnny Mnuemonic," and other campy Keanu flicks. The film actually depicts the surfing community closer than any other mainstream movie, save maybe Fast Times At Ridgemont High. Lori Petty distracts from an otherwise well chosen cast, all in all I give this film a "7" despite the awfully delivered line that makes up the one line summary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>breathtakingly exciting, adrenaline soaked.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surely one of the most exciting action movies of the 90's, although Terminator 2 beats it to film of the year, this comes close, with Cameron's former wife Kathryn Bigelow directing ( she directed Near Dark )you might be forgiven for thinking this may well be another action movie wannabe, however she adds a kind of searing energy and heart pounding adrenaline to the proceedings that makes an solid action film into something else and sends you to the repeat button over and over again. Well scripted by W Peter Iliff and remarkably well photographed, this like one of Cameron's movies is technically brilliant, featuring an enjoyably implausible plot and perfect pacing. Bigelow certainly knows how to make an movie. The story is fairly simple, FBI agent Johnny Utah ( Keanu Reeves )goes undercover to try and catch an gang of bank robbers led by Patrick Swayze who are also surfers and during raids wear masks of former presidents which adds an brilliantly satirical edge to otherwise just superior action movie. Lori petty ( pre Tank Girl )is the love interest and Gary Busey is the veteran cop who assists him and all give excellent performances including Reeves who's never been better since. SPOILERALERT. But the real reason to see this though is to see the final bank raid that goes spectacularly wrong and most of all to see Johnny Utah ( what a cool name!!! ) jump without an parachute. All in all, well worth seeing and an superb action fest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Keanu Reeves stars in his first notable action movie, along withPatrick Swayze in his first villain role, and Gary Busey doing afunny Nick Nolte impression (Busey and Nolte look a lot alike tome sometimes. Anyone else agree? E-mail me if you think so!!!).Reeves is a rookie FBI agent with the thankless name of JohnnyUtah, who goes undercover as a beach bum to nail a rag-tag groupof bank robbers nicknamed The Ex-Presidents, which derive fromtheir masks made to look like Carter, Johnson, Nixon, andReagan. So, with his older partner Pappas (Busey, who lookedreally chubby in this movie!), Utah tries to bag the dudes, andat the same time, makes friends with a surfer girl named Tyler(Lori Petty) and the shady guru Bodi (Swayze).A weird film that blends 60's philosophy with furious action,"Point Break" is a pretty cool movie. Sure, it might be a bitoverlong and the plot twists as obvious as cheaper parlour magictricks, but this movie's performances and action make up forthat. Plus, the movie includes nice surfing and sky-div</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woah!!! Point Break is brilliant! Seriously, this is one of the best action films of the 90's. The key to its success is Kathryn Bigelow's excellent direction. The surfing and skydiving sequences are so well done, and the chase halfway through is one of the best set-pieces I have ever seen in a film. The whole feel of this film is similar to Joel Schumacher's The Lost Boys, and that was also a brilliant film , so no complaints. Not as good as Bigelow's earlier Near Dark (which was even more similar to The Lost Boys, both being vampire films and having pretty similar plots), but still a killer ride. When the posters for this claimed it to be "100% Pure Adrenaline", they weren't joking.</fullReview>

Keanu Reeves does a pretty good job playing an undercover FBI Agent, but in some scenes he still talks like he was doing another Bill &amp; Ted movie. Patrick Swayze does a wonderful job as the bad guy, one of the main reasons he is so good in this role, is because this is one of the rare times you get to see him as a villain.

		<fullReview>This movie has a very simple and illogical story; a FBI agent learns to surf because they find out that a group of bank robbers are surfers??? In my opinion this is a waste of our taxes because the chances of finding the bank robbers with this method is about one to 1 million. Apart from this, Point Break is quite a good film. It contains the best sky diving, surf und chase scenes I've ever seen. I ask myself how it was possible to film the surf scene in Australia during this storm of the century. By the way, the second sky diving scene is absolutely impossible. Utah hesitates over 5 seconds before he jumps. The airspeed of the plane is about 400 m/h. So Utah would have to fly over 800 m horizontally to reach the others.Evaluation 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Point Break is a great movie; it's fast, it's clever, it's fun to watch. I own it, and I've seen it at least 30 times. It's not like you'll ever 'get anything new' out of it, it's just a very entertaining movie.HOWEVER - Keanu Reeves gives one of the worst performances ever captured on film. He's so wooden, he's lucky one of the extras didn't mistake him for a surfboard. Anyone besides me confused on his delivery of the line "you won - you got what you wanted"? The first ten times I saw this, I thought he flubbed his line and the director didn't care enough to reshoot it. On that subject, he also flubbed a line in Dracula - "I fear for Mina - she is now now just a decoy"... OK, now I'm just being mean.You know, he did a great performance in The Matrix (well, maybe it wasn't a performance, but he certainly nailed the part), and after Point Break, Dracula and Johnny Mnemonic I went into that one expecting the worst. It's not like the guy doesn't have any talent (although, he'll always be Ted to me). But here, man!, he's not believable for a second.Still a great movie though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"100% pure adrenaline" is the type of tag line that sums up this movie extremely well. This is slam bang action at its best. I tell ya', Kathryn Bigelow definitely knows how to direct an entertaining movie. I have seen all her work and her visual presence never ceases to be impressive.Have you ever had the experience of watching a movie so much that you want to watch it again right away, I mean where you go right back out to the box office and buy another ticket and watch it again. This is exactly what I did with this film. This is the only movie that I have ever watched or had the desire to watch twice back to back. It just had me. I think I love it so much because it contains all of the thrills that I have dreamed of pursuing. At that time I wanted to skydive in the worst way, and I also wanted to try surfing, but had never had the opportunity for either. This film was so thrilling that I felt like I had taken a two week vacation and done it all. The skydiving scenes were just stellar, as were the surfing scenes, especially the one that took place at night.The movie is all about thrills, so Bigelow succeeding in ever way in making a thrilling film. From the exciting score to the excellent foot chase through the back alleys and a few houses of a suburb, every moment of "Point Break" is a thrill. In the film, Patrick Swayze's character has a spiritual connection with thrill seeking adventures (surfing, robbing banks, sky diving, etc). He's trying to find the "ultimate ride". Let me tell you, this movie is the ultimate ride.Many people that I talk to criticize it for not having a story. Granted, it doesn't really have a conceivable story, but who cares! If the screenwriter has tried to build a plausible story with this material, the level of thrill achieved would not have exceeded that from which you receive from drinking a cup of coffee or smoking a cigarette. In this kind of a movie, you just want to be entertained, and I for one just sat back and enjoyed the ride without even thinking about the plausibility of the plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is simply one of THE BEST movies I have ever seen. Keanu Reeves does a great job as an undercover FBI agent, hanging out at some really scenic California beaches, looking out for a gang of bank robbers who also happen to be surfers. Reeves is great and yet outclassed by Patrick Swayze who plays the philosopher/leader/guru of his gang of surfers. The beautiful beaches and the camaraderie amongst the surfers combined with their super-cool lifestyles made me wanna be there and be a part of them. Gary Busey too has a fairly decent part to play and is at his growling, macho best. I personally don't freak for Lori Petty but her role suited her and she's done a great job. Although there's a lot of stuff going on, for me the movie was about Swayze's philosophy - that freedom is penultimate, and you don't need to live by anybody's rules when you can make your own. I cannot praise this movie enough. Not everybody is destined to see something this great. . . it's gotta be written in your Karma!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An action/surfing movie, Kathryn Bigelow's "Point Break" has little to offer outside her well-choreographed action sequences.While the surfing is good, there is little of it (nothing much for surfing fans). The humour is only mildly amusing, and the cast (which included Patrick Swayze, Keanu Reeves, Gary Busey and Lori Petty) are not much more than reasonably enjoyable. The two bank robberies look professional (perhaps executive producer James Cameron helped out), while the definite highlight is the tense 'bust' sequence early in the film. Definitely wait for this one on video, or even TV.Tuesday, January 21, 1992 - Knox District Centre</fullReview>

Aside from that Patrick Swayze has quite possibly the greatest role of his career in this movie. He lives to ride the 50 year storm, and finances his surfing life through questionable means. Some of the greatest movie lines ever have come from this movie, quotes my buddies and I use all the time to this day.

		<fullReview>I didn't find this film to bad at all. It is a little on the dude side which is great but apart from that this is a strong story and can uphold it's cast. This was the film that made Keanu Reeves the action hero type person that he is today because all I knew of him before Point Break was the Bill and Ted movies and Parenthood. It's hard to believe that Reeves was the first person offered the part of Chris in Platoon which is a leading role and would have started him off a lot earlier in his career if he did but Charlie Sheen took it instead. I heard the reason Reeves didn't except the part was because the script was to violent. It's quite hard to image that he thought this after starring in Speed, The Matrix Trilogy and Point Break. Interesting trivia.Anyway Point Break is one of the best of Patrick Swayze's career as it is for Keanu Reeves. I mean you have chicks, action, robbery, sky diving and surfing. I ask you, what could you possibly want more from an action film. I was very vulnerable when first seeing Point Break, I think I was about 10 or 11 and never really caught on that Swayze was the bad guy throughout all this because in the trailer you are not made to think that. Well that's what I thought anyway. So when watching it I was pleasantly surprised to see how it turned out and it was my first real twist in a film that I had ever seen before. I know a lot of people who really dislike this but just look at it for what it is which is a fun film with more action than you need, a dozen different endings and surfers robbing banks, I mean dude what more is there to ask for??????Naked Chicks Surfing????.Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

The airplane scenes are great too (did they do their own stunts? It sure seemed like it!). Even the usual tomboy Lori Petty is pretty and engaging here. Gary Busey is a hoot, too.

		<fullReview>There are movies you can do without, my friend Estelle said. It's true. For example, you don't need to watch "American Beauty" if you love cinema; I personally think is overrated and, although very good, only worth it because of some performances. Of course, there are also movies that you must see, nut I'm not getting into that now because these are many.However, I would like to do it rather than writing about "Point Break"; I'm so bored because it's just a very boring film. It's not bad though, and I need to make that clear?But it's not good either. I tried to think of things that could have made it better but I found it very difficult; there are films that contain so much gibberish that you can't believe your ears.When Johnny (Keanu Reeves) goes undercover to try to find who some guys who robbed a bank disguised as ex-presidents are, a story you know by heart begins its development. The background this time is surfing, and the moral principles of the surfers are the gibberish I mentioned. These are the people that Johnny is investigating, and their leader Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) is one of those charismatic guys who are popular because of how they talk (they are convincing) but don't have a trace of sense in the ideas they profess.Bodhi's philosophy involves a fight against a 'system'. Which system? We try to understand, but we don't really know. This is a big mistake made by W. Peter Iliff; the screenwriter who thought he could put some depth into a movie that didn't show it in its simple and convenient premise. Between all the embarrassing lines of his script, Iliff gets a couple of good moments; particularly an explanation about fear given by Swayze with undeniable conviction.The rest is wind?Wind blowing in the beach where the surfers unleash their adrenaline as they go angrily towards the wave and have a lot fun. Wind in the sky, as they also sky dive. All of this looks nice and tidy because Donald Peterman's cinematography is inventive, but these sequences are overly long, and tiring.Should I blame director Kathryn Bigelow? The female director, who has done a lot of movies involving cops, fails in completing the main point of any cop movie: exciting action scenes. And this is the boredom I was talking about; we see bank robberies, chase scenes, fight sequences and we never feel the hype. I was sitting and my head wasn't moving or expressing a sign of excitement as bullets were going through the air and blood was all around.The edition didn't help either, establishing no connection between some scene changes. The fact that "Point Break" is a very popular film, does not assure that it is good, you see? Because Keanu Reeves is a popular actor but, except for the roles where he is completely calm, he is not good. Actually, he's a robot; and this film is good evidence to watch him saying his lines with the least sense of belief. He's very good at screaming and swearing, though, but he should have learned something from Patrick Swayze.I recently watched "The Negotiator"; it was the typical cop story, but the performances made it completely worth it. When there's two actors, they both have to be connected; and I say this because "Point Break" is promising and could have been more. Maybe someone will come and shoot a remake or create a sequel that does justice to the film. In the meantime, there are movies you can do without; "Point Break" is one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best action/drama movies ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Point Break is one of my all time favorite movies. The movie shows you the outcome of going undercover. Keanu Reeves does an excellent job playing an FBI agent and Patrick Swayzne is wonderful as the villain. The surfing and the sky-diving scenes were shot wonderfully. The reason why I love this movie so much is because its a hands down action movie, no special effects are in this film. I have not seen another action movie to take its place, in fact none have even come close. The one thing that this movie will show you is when the truth hurts, example is when Keanu Reeves has the chance to shoot Swayzne when he chases him, but realizes he can't pull the trigger. The ending to this movie is about the best I have ever seen. The only thing that I dont like about this movie, it should have received a lot more attention that it got!Rating: **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rookie FBI agent, "Johnny Utah" (Keanu Reeves) has been assigned to the Los Angeles in to the Bank Robbery Division fresh out of training. He is a bit gung-ho, and is partnered up with a veteran (Gary Busey) who is fairly similar to him."Agent Angelo Pappas" (Busey) has been hunting a gang of professional bank robbers, each wearing a mask in the resemblance of former US Presidents which caused the authorities to nickname them "The Ex-Presidents." "Pappas" has a theory that the bank robbers are, in fact, surfers financing their travels in search of the best wave. However, not even the head of the division believes his theory, which is based on evidence.The two, with "Utah" going undercover, go to the local beaches to find possible suspects, as the robberies continue.Now, the two go in search of the bank robbers to bring them to justice.Let me say first, this is not the best movie I've seen as of late. There are more problems with this movie than entertainment.First of all, the acting is uneven. Although certain people have chemistry when together, their performances as a whole lack. I did not like the chemistry between Reeves and Lori Petty, who portrayed "Utah's" love interest while undercover. The biggest problem with their on-screen relationship is that Petty is not on screen enough. You feel nothing when something happens to her which gives a predictable twist in the plot. You couldn't even feel the emotion from Reeves.Reeves is easily one of the worst performances. His delivery of his lines was very uneven, especially near the start of the film. If you listen carefully, he brings back his "Bill and Ted" voice in a brief moment in one scene which, if you notice it, gives the audience a chuckle. On the other hand, Swayze, who plays the lead robber, had a better performance. However, if you ask me, Swayze was not really into the script, and his performance showed that.As for the script itself. It's not very good at all. I was not impressed with the dialogue, nor a good chunk of the scenes. There were some good action scenes, with one fantastic foot chase through the streets, and at least one private residence, that had some real good editing, which was also uneven.Then there are the surf scenes. These were horribly produced. None of them were exciting or edited in a way that made you want to watch the scenes. I wasn't even impressed with the music laid over these shots.The soundtrack was completely forgettable. I can't even name one song that was in this movie. In fact, if I happen to hear the soundtrack in passing, I wouldn't recognize it as this movie's soundtrack.The director did a horrible job putting this movie together. Poor script, uneven performances, big plot holes. I can only recommend that, if there is nothing better to do, check this movie out on HBO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Point Break" is one of my all-time favorite action films! This film is definitely one of the best action films around. I throughly enjoyed it from start to finish.I don't care what anyone says, Keanu Reeves is an awesome actor! I really like his style quite a bit. No, he's not perfect, but he is very entertaining in his films. Patrick Swayze was a perfect choice for the character of Bohdi, although I must admit that he wasn't the obvious choice. Gary Busey was his usual self in this film and very good at what he does. Lori Petty looks better than ever and does a fine acting job as well. John C. McGinley was excellent as well. Also, there is an interesting cameo of Anthony Kiedis of Red Hot Chili Peppers.I thought the story was quite original and rather interesting. The story is very similar to "Fast And The Furious", although revolving around a different type of extreme sport. In any case, if you like "Fast and the Furious" you should like this film as well.The direction in this film is just fantastic! This is most definitely my favorite film directed by Kathryn Bigelow, not to say that her other films are great as well. She seems to have a very good eye and knows how to get good shots.The action sequences are excellent, there is one scene in particular where my jaw just hit the floor, I couldn't believe what had just happened. If you've seen the film, I hope you know what scene I'm talking about.Anyhow, if you like action films or you like any of the fore-mentioned actors/director, then you really ought to see this film. In complete honesty, I think this is one of the best action films EVER! I truly hope that you enjoy the film as much as I do. Thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

Well ,if only he hadn´t that hurt knee...it´s certainly not a lack of stamina. And it´s the same with that movie, pure action. Yet the most remarkable appearance is Gary Busey who can´t really conceal his belly under that surfers´ t-shirt. See him offer cold Pizza to his stakeout-colleagues and laugh your guts out.

		<fullReview>I've seen a few stinkers, but this was the only film I ever walked out on. Something about it meant my disbelief stubbornly refused to be suspended, and I found the whole thing ridiculously unbelievable.I felt it got off to a bad start - that by finding carnauba wax in the mud left on a bank counter, the police could make the intellectual leap to decide that the Dead Presidents were serious surfers. Or maybe it's the 'Johnny Utah' name - Ebert's rule, that any film that resorts to using silly names is in serious trouble at the screenplay level - comes into play.But the final straw was when Utah went to try to teach himself to surf, nearly drowns, but luckily gets rescued - by the girlfriend of Bodhi, who introduces him to the gang. Sorry, but that was just too far-fetched.I can't really explain it, since similarly improbable events in other films are accepted quite happily. Or maybe it's that I'm not exactly a Keanu Reeves fan. But I just couldn't get into the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who Knew Surfing and Law Enforcement Worked So Well?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Point Break follows the obsession of FBI special agent Keanu Reeves in catching four bank robbers who dress up like ex-presidents. This soon becomes overshadowed by his obsession with surfing with Patrick Swayze and the love a woman who looks like a 10-year old boy (played by Lori "Tank Girl" Petty). Some intense surfing and skydiving scenes follow, as does a foot chase that rivals the foot chase sequence from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." Ultimately, will Keanu Reeves choose his love of surfing or love of fighting crime when the two come in conflict? The answer might surprise you! This movie also likely sets the record for most times the word "s**t" can be heard in one movie, and definitely within one scene. Also featuring cameos by Tom Sizemore and Anthony Kiedis. If they took out the extended kissing scene or better yet all of Petty's scenes, this film would be highly recommended. Otherwise, moderately recommended.</fullReview>

Here you'll find an average direction, a standard 90's soundtrack, a good acting (excellent cast) and funny action. So why this high vote? Well, this movie lives of a very nice plot and of typical 90's atmospheres you won't find in the newest movies. I mean, I watched this movie with a smile on my face, maybe I'm just too nostalgic... If you were too young to watch this movie when it came out and you sometimes ask yourself "what kind of movie would I watched if I were born 10 year sooner?"(don't know if the consecutio is right :-) ), Point Break is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best bad movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This flick is to big budget films what PLAN 9 and ROBOT MONSTER were to low budget films: laughably entertaining! Just listen to the plot: a former football star joins the FBI and his first assignment is to see if a group of surfers are responsible for a "wave" of bank robberies where the suspects are dressed like ex-presidents (a device lifted from BEST SELLER). For absolutely no reason, the surfers skydive. The philosophical soliloquies by their leader Bodhi are hysterical and would make Rodin cringe. it's a shame this movie is so bad because Kathryn Bigelow does a good job directing it. Keanu Reeves isn't a believable hero, and his ignorance makes the POLICE ACADEMY crew look professional. Swayze and his surfers aren't credible villains, because let's face it, you watch their activities and you see a bunch of alienated kids looking for a good time rather some truly cold blooded criminals. The skydiving scenes seem thrown in because the producers couldn't find a rational place for them in any other film. They must have said "this film is bad enough on paper, we might as well throw this into the mix." All in all, a wipeout, but if you want a better film with a similar premise, check out STONE COLD with a REAL former football star, and villains who are believable in their ruthlessness.</fullReview>

Such horrendous acting, such a horrendous plot, where do I even start? Keanu Reeves, though I enjoyed his performance in Braham Stoker's Dracula, is at his all-time monotonic worst here, with lines like "No! It's time for you to go down!" or something silly like that. I guess you have to be one of those people who considers surfing a "way of life" to appreciate this movie. But then again, even surfers had to laugh at Patrick Swayze's assertion that he had "lived his whole life" for the chance to catch that absurdly gigantic tidal wave at the end. The only thing memorable about the film is the Ronald Reagan mask, and that should say it all about the futility of Point Break.</fullReview>

Glorifies the worst traits of masculinity, entirely predictable, and people getting mortally wounded every 10 minutes in it.

As a former skydiver, I found the airborne scenes too bad to even be funny. God help any viewer who tries to copy such fantasy stunts in real life! Also, as an ex-cop, I do NOT feel sympathy for a cop who finds it hard to stop a friend from violently robbing a bank. Feel guilty about people being in danger because you didn't do your job, yes! To summarise: if watching Keanu Reeves read a phone book turns you on, this might be a good film. If you thought Superman was too realistic, maybe this is viewable. However, if you prefer a good story with some degree of realism, avoid this one like a rabid leper!</fullReview>

Makes surfing look almost as cool as it is, Zen-like. But let down by the second half. The shootings, body count, completely unnecessary. Wasn't clear whether the Director was trying to glorify Bodhi's life (as it appeared at the end) or send some other message, like crime doesn't pay, or some such.Was left with a couple of unanswered questions: 1. What kinda name is Johnny Utah? 2. The scenes where Bodhi valiantly fights Johnny on Torquay Beach, and all the times that he pulls a gun on Johnny and comes out on top made me wonder, how come he doesn't know that Johnny is The One?</fullReview>

Gary Busey plays his fellow agent and mentor.The chase scenes are exciting; the hand gliding scenes over the ocean are phenomenal. What brings the film down is the way many attempt to break the system down.The ending was ridiculous as far as I'm concerned. We're not just letting criminals virtually commit suicide so as to satisfy their cravings in life.

		<shortDescription>One of the first "XTreem" action movies. Still not bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kathryn Bigelow probably needs to direct more, her rap-sheet includes The Hurt Locker, Near Dark and even Blue Steel was pretty good.And Point Break, the ultimate 90s (teen) action film.For some reason I wasn't that blown away by this when it came out despite being the perfect age of 17 or 18. I think it is because the so called x-treme sports have never grabbed me, BMX, skateboarding and in the case of Point Break surfing and sky-diving just never seemed that awesome.But nonetheless Point Break moves quickly has a lot of action crammed in to a "yeah right!" plot.Keanu Reeves is rookie detective Johnny Utah (Woah), and Gary Busey is his grizzled and initially unwilling partner Angelo Pappas. They are assigned to track down a bank-robbing gang called the "Ex-Presidents", so named for the masks that the 4 guys wear when performing their efficient, successful and largely non-violent heists.Angelo has a theory that he is initially reluctant to share: that the robbers are in fact surfers who pull the jobs to finance their bohemian adrenalin-chasing lifestyle, and who follow the Summer around. Now apparently Summer is almost over, so the window to catch them this year is coming to a close, so the hokily named Utah must go undercover as a surfer to attempt to discover the identity of the robbers.Cue a couple of montages which show his progress from newbie to meh surfer over the course of a few minutes, all while under the tutelage of local experienced surfer-girl Tyler, played by a pint sized Lori Petty.Now Point Break is two hours long, most of that action sequences, so Utah can't waste time in tracking down the Ex-Presidents or we'll have a 4 hour movie on our hands - this necessitates some cinematic coincidences.Tyler is the sometime girlfriend of a renowned local surfer named Bohdi, (Lucky!) upon the first meeting between Bohdi and Utah they get along just fine despite him hanging around his missus, (Lucky!) and he is invited to join in an impromptu game of NFL (Lucky!), where it comes to light that Utah was a star college quarterback who only left the game through a chronic injury. When this is made public all semblance of resentment and mistrust between Utah and the surfers evaporates. Who knew his past identity? Bohdi, that's who! (Lucky!) Bohdi is played by Patrick Swayze.Shortly after this meeting Utah surfs the local beach again after being directed there by some evidence left at a hold up crime-scene. A scuffle between him and the locals breaks out, only to be broken up by? do I even need to say it? So Bohdi then invites Utah around to his house for a party that night to drink his beer, enjoy his company and nail his missus, and Johnny Utah does all three! Shortly after a raid-gone-wrong on some surfing suspect's pad, Utah realizes that he was hanging out with the robbers all along. You could call it his "woah" moment, but that might have been done before.Again Summer is ending and time is running out, so Pappas and Utah follow the group (basically Swayze and three faceless dudes there to provide enough numbers to call them a "group") to a bank that they may be casing.They arrive moments too late after yet another cinematic sandwich-related diversion (when will Hollywood give up on this gimmickry?), and after a long chase scene on foot Utah finds he has no choice but to shoot several rounds pointlessly into the air, rather than shoot the guy he just chased in the leg or something. Such is the bond built by a few random meetings and brief experiences.(Pappas doesn't make it all the way, and it must be said that Gary Busey's death face looks more like a mask than the actual mask the robbers wear, such is the weathered state even 20 years ago!) Now the cat is out of the bag and Utah's true identity is known to the Ex-Prez, so they have taken Tyler hostage and will kill her if Utah gets in the way of their last job of the season and subsequent escape.Of course Utah can't just let them go, and the movie closes with a few more chases, gunfights, a robbery and wait for it, some skydiving.(The finale leads Utah to Australia, which I wouldn't mention if it weren't for the sheer atrociousness of the Oz accents.) Final Rating ? 7 / 10. Not the all time classic this is described as on occasion, but an effective action movie with the emphasis on action.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com</fullReview>

I don't want to reveal the way the plot unfolds, but I have to note the similarity with a whole series of films such as? I won't say, that could constitute a spoiler itself, with the ending being perfectly the same. Of course, chronology is important, and so this movie here, I think, is the origin of the scheme. If I'm not aware of some other movie, stemming from the same concept, that preceded this one, forgive me for my lack of knowledge and feel obliged to point it out in a comment. But if this indeed is the original, it has to be seen not only because of that, but because of the better acting, the better action sequences and the smarter plot ? smarter at least by the standards that have secondary importance here compared to what the story wants to deliver to its target audiences. Which is: providing some adrenaline-surfing to those living on it as well as to those starving for it. With regards to the latter, meanly put, this is real surfers out there for net-surfers, for people who will try to visually import adventure to make up for a lack of manliness in the 'mainstream' male life-form of nowadays. For them this film might be medicine.You don't have to switch off your brain as much as in the case of the successor clones (again, not to be named), but the point is definitely not to stimulate thoughts surpassing a rather simple state of mind in critical evaluation of our basic instincts.So, join the fight club and identi-fly! With this much testosterone, the Asian tsunami wave of December, 2004 might seem like a challenge. Not an intellectual or a humanitarian one, of course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is a brilliant action movie. Probably the best action movie of the 90´s.Katherin Bigelow, did something i never thought possible, a male all-action movie with plenty of guns and explosions but wich doesn´t feels like macho crap all the time. Now that´s almost impossible in american cinema. This is a very masculine movie, but never macho. In my opinion it depicts perfectly the masculin spirit, from an adrenalin point of view.The funny thing is that it was directed by a woman ! Well, congratulations, finaly a masculin movie wich doesn´t feels totaly cliché in its aproach. And let´s not confuse this with the script, wich in its own merit is a very original take on a story like this. Exciting, original and with the right balance between action and the characters, wich despite simple structured are always interesting to follow. And finaly an action movie, wich doesn´t have a bad guy or a real villain. Have you noticed this ? There are no villains in this movie, just people caught in diferent sides of the law, despite sharing the same feeling. This is pretty original, for a comercial action movie.The action scenes are fantastic. Probably my favorite action sequences ever. I love the way the urban action is filmed, wich pulls the viewer almost inside the movie, using those fabulous steady-cam chases through small alleys and small rooms. The skydiving sequences are simply brilliant and totaly believable, (did the actors realy skydive for this?).The characters are good and interesting with the perfect actors for it, the action is superior, it´s very well filmed, the story is good, and the ending is great. But above all it gives the viewer a rush of adrenalin, and makes us want to go surf and skydive right away.Realy 100% pure adrenalin. POINT BREAK is the type of movie you can watch many times, and still be thrilled every time you see it.This is how you make an action movie. Unfortunely nodbody seems to have noticed it since then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever watch a movie that you know is just so campy and dated- where the dialogue makes you scratch your head a few times every couple of lines-where the premise is so ridiculous that you look at it anyway to see how dumb it'll get? Well, that's what "Point Break" is. And it takes itself quite seriously at that. A 1991 summer lackluster from versatile director Kathryn Bigelow ("Strange Days", "K-19") that could of fared better in the theatres if it were only released in March of that year instead. Come on- did they really think that they had a chance against Ahhh-nuld that summer with "T-2"? Every time I watch this movie, I smirk and shake my head (and it just isn't because of Keanu Reeves' acting talent- although he's not as bad in this flick as he is in every other one). It's mainly the dialogue- words and phrases like: "meat waffles"; "100% pure adrenaline"; "what's their program?"; "like stink on sh*t"; "I love this speed-star sh*t!"; "I know you want me like acid in your mouth, Johnny!"; they all crack me up. This is merely a live-action cartoon with some alright surf footage (though I'd rather watch "Riding Giants" or "Step Into Liquid"). The skydiving scenes were tight (remember that this was on the eve of CGI, so the stunts were real). I even dug the footchase through the alleys by the beach and through the houses. Even the Mexican stand-off at the airport was good and bloody. The climax had zero credibility and Keanu's "Via con Dios" line was just as fitting to the disappointing ending.Still, this movie could have been so much worse, but I don't think it could of been a whole lot better. They could of used a much prettier actress of the time like Elisabeth Shue to play Tyler, though. Keanu just looks like the prettier one between the two. Lori Petty just isn't leading woman material. She's better off as the sidekick ("A League of Their Own")and I know that she's kicking herself for turning down Sandra Bullock's part in "Speed" to this day. Gary Busey provided some comic relief and made Keanu's usual stoic acting not as much, along with Patrick Swayze. Swayze pulled off a better performance than Keanu (doesn't everyone?), and it was kind of hard to fully dislike the dude. John C. McGinley, James LeGros, and Tom Sizemore (you'll never see him THAT thin again) all provide decent supporting roles. "Guess we just have ourselves an a$$hole shortage...""...Not so far."Oh wait-- he forgot to add the:"WHOA !"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable &amp; Weak Story. Point.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was worse than I expected. The story is very weak and underdeveloped. There are many unsolved questions. It is not really an action movie but I cannot tell you more about, only avoid or just rent it and go through. Perhaps the writer thought that finally it is a film but this is not enough to keep the audience entertaining. The only point I liked were the superb pictures from the sea and the sky. That´s all. Only 6/10. The director did a better job in "K-19" starring Harrison Ford which I can recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Point Break" is a typical action flick built around an FBI agent (Reeves) who goes undercover with a bunch of surfers (Swayze &amp; Petty) in order to catch a group of bank robbers. Using the Cameron more-is-more theory of film making, Bigelow manages to squeeze romance, shootouts, chases, stunts &amp; pyro, sky diving, surfing, etc. into this 2 hour long mindless action flick and weave them all together with a story which is a cut above the average action drama. Curiously, there's little sex - one of Hollywood's most common gratuitous commodities - and the female lead is not your usual babelicious which may be a deficit which comes with the director's gender. Anyone in need of a testosterone rush who doesn't mind the fact that the film stars three male non-actors should give this one a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like every other crime thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Keanu Reeves (The Matrix) stars as Johnny Utah, a newly recruited agent who is assigned an undercover task to seek out "The Presidents", a group of professional bank robbers, which leads Utah into a trail of high adrenaline stunts, romance and friendship, testing his strength to the maximum.The crime genre has changed over the last couple of decades, with more CGI, gun fights and showdowns encoded for high octane viewing, and this Kathryn Bigelow (Near dark) justifies most conventions in a typical crime thriller.Far from their best performances in the careers, Reeves and Swayze (Dirty dancing) are headlined as the stars of the show and fulfil the male icon, the tough cop and the sophisticated cool dude, and though the relationship between the characters is interesting, it doesn't have enough personality to cope with the dialogue and changes in the plot to make it dramatic enough.However, Swayze's character Bodhi has an interesting perspective on life, on the freedom of society and to live for breathtaking moments, which does make his character intriguing and one of the reasons to carry on watching, even though the plot tails on an off all the way through.With typical manly conventions such as guns, fighting, drinking and swearing all encoded, this film is a real guy film, though a soppy cliché of a romantic story is thrown in, like every other crime film out there and being a fan of the crime thriller genre I was disappointed, given the sceptical of surfing as an interesting sub story. The plot is inconsistent and doesn't do much justice to the genre, with poor direction in fights and chases and such.Despite its faults, it can still be entertaining for guys who like adrenaline and typical male heroes and so forth, but for me it was poorly scripted, pretty predictable, clichéd, like every other crime film, and with very little different from any other new cop, new challenge, conflicted feelings film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not much else to say really, but here are the high points....Possibly the best foot chase sequence ever filmed, with Keanu (Johnny Utah) chasing down Patrick Swayze, down alleyways through gardens, a french window, having a dog thrown at him... Ms Bigelow's direction of this sequence is stunning.John C McGinley throwing his toys out of the pram over Pappas and Utah's lack of progress, asking what they have acheived, and Utah explaining that he cut his first tube...Surfing and skydiving sequences, that are just beautifully choreographed, colour and texture par excellence.Nixon (the rubber faced bank robbing surfer) explaining to the bank as he leaves "I'm not a crook"...The kid who tells Keanu that its never to late to start surfing... "But I'm 25".. "Like I said, its never too late!"If the film has a fault, it is the end sequence, that sees Patrick Swayze's character who abhors violence and lives life to surf, actually breaking his own rules, resulting in his entire group of surf buddies being wiped out in shootouts at the bank and the airport...The film did not need to kill them all off, but undoubtedly Hollywood pressure for the crescendo guns blazing type ending swayed the decision... Even so, this is done in a not entirely unbelievable manner, and beats hands down the action movies of its genre.Without Tarantino, Ms Bigelow might have had the best action flick of the 90's with Point Break. It is worth bearing in mind that before this film, Keanu Reeves was only really a Ted "Theodore" Logan as one half of Bill and Ted. This film undoubtedly was a major factor in turning him into an action hero, and opening doors to even more diverse roles. Its a source!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Point Break</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching this, 15 years later it still comes off fresh. Great plot from a solid storyline. Not overly complex, and maintains an edge well for an action movie without overly resorting to big special effects. Also a good rep for Gen Xer's, the first movie to take it to the extreme? Gary Busey did a great job with his role, the supporting cast is solid - Anthony Keidis from the RHCP's with a spot role as a surf punk. Nice comeback for Swayze for me, liked the early stuff - Red Dawn, Outsiders, Youngblood, but Dirty Dancing and Roadhouse were terrible. He needed this film as much as it needed him. Keanu didn't fare too badly after this either. After hiccuping with Bill and Ted, he followed up with My Own Private Idaho before raising the stakes with Speed and a few Wachowski brothers projects. Wow, of all of Reeves' films, I've seen Point Break the most. Great flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but could have been so much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suspenseful and exciting action sequences require three things: an attention-grabbing event, energetic camera-work, and an appropriate amount of character development. "Point Break" has the former, but not the latter. As a result, the film's countless action sequences raise the pulse, but only a little.Ex-football star Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) has been transferred to the FBI bank robbery division in Los Angeles. He's coming right in the middle of a string of bank robberies by a group who calls themselves "The Ex-Presidents," after the masks of former presidents that the robbers wear to protect their identities. Utah's partner, Pappas (Gary Busey) thinks that the robbers may be surfers, so he sends Utah to the beaches to learn how to surf and infiltrate their ranks.The problem with the film is that we are not given a single person to care about in this film. There isn't just very little character development, there is NO character development. One could argue that action movies like this don't need it, and to add it would only slow the film down. In many cases this is true, but as Jan de Bont proved three years later, it is indeed possible to create adequately developed characters while still keeping the pace high.It's such a shame that this movie forgot a key element to creating a good action movie. The performances are all solid, even clichéd development probably would have done the trick. And director Kathryn Bigalow knows a thing or two about pacing an action movie.Still, it's worth at least a rental. The action sequences are inventive enough to keep a decent level of interest, and the film is a cult favorite so you may end up appreciating it more than I did.My rating: PG-13 for violence and language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>POINT BREAK (Kathryn Bigelow, 1991) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has turned up countless times on Italian TV over the years, but I never had a particular inclination to check it out; still, ever since director Bigelow's fresh Oscar triumph, I thought I could do no harm in checking it out (along with a couple of her earlier efforts). Part undercover-cop thriller (hardly original) and part water-sport exhibitionism (afforded undue significance and really not my cup of tea!), I naturally found the former elements much more engaging ? notably the bank robberies (with the criminals dressed in masks depicting former U.S. Presidents) and a lengthy chase around the halfway point (starting in cars on busy streets and continuing on foot through the rather exposed houses). However, the climax is a drawn-out affair as it goes from a bungled 'bank job' to the airport, the desert and a definitive showdown on an Australian beach! Besides, the cast does not exactly set the screen on fire: the typically wooden Keanu Reeves' exclamations of excitement prove particularly annoying ? though, again, Patrick Swayze's role (and some of the existential dialogue here) has obtained additional gravitas with his recent untimely passing. The film is proficient, then, and patchily entertaining ? but not exactly essential fare either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Decided to buy this when I'd been reminded about it by several of Bill Simmons' podcasts. In the day I thought it was cool- had it held up after 18 years though? Here's my answer."Point Break" is based around Johnny Utah (Reeves), a new member of LA's armed robbery division. Johhny is soon put to work on trying to catch the "Ex-Presidents", a group of 4 robbers who are hitting some of the biggest banks and doing it in a very quick, precise and efficient manner. Utah follows the hunch of his new partner Angelo (Busey) who believes the "Ex-Presidents" are surfers in their non-bank robbing time. Soon Johnny finds himself undercover, learning to surf and quickly hooking up with Tyler (Lori Petty), who shows him the ropes and helps him meet some of the local surfers. He comes across some real characters, some he likes such as Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) and some he dislikes, like Tone (the lead-singer of the Chilli Peppers). Johhny soon faces danger at every turn. WIll he find his men and bring them in or will he throw away the badge and pursue his new love of surfing? Has aged a little, but the stunts are pretty great, especially the skydiving (so well pulled off they had 2 separate scenes which lead to people needing to skydive.) The ex-president idea was genius at the time and still is cool and parts of the story are great, but others are just plain stupid. Plenty of ham (such as the crazy cop with the right hunch and the other two partners always jerking the main cops' chain) and unbelievable scenes, but pretty good for it's day, especially the stunts. Nothing looked fake. Could have used some more scenes robbing banks and a little more on the budding mancrush between Bodhi and Johnny. Enough good scenes to make it memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cool Cops and Robbers Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even my dad enjoys this film. Keanu Reeves showed American audiences that he could actually act when he starred in Point Break. Patrick Swayze provides a great supporting role and the necessary skills to made it look respectable. Gary Busey steals the show as usual and provides a lot of humor to what would be otherwise a deadly serious dramatic affair. Here's the plot. A gang of bank robbers known as the Ex-Presidents are the best in L.A. They are in and out in 60 seconds and nobody gets killed. They've never been caught in 26 robberies. But they are about to be given a wake up call by rookie FBI Agent Johnny Utah and his partner Angelo Pappas, who have come up with a plan to figure out who they are and infiltrate them. This movie is filled with action and witty banter amongst the actors which can't help but entertain you the entire time. And the ending doesn't let you down. One of the more solid action movies of the 1990's.</fullReview>

This just fantastic fun all around, and i really loved the setting, plus Keanu Reeves and Gary Busey had pretty good chemistry together. I had high expectations for this, and i wasn't disappointed, in fact i would go as far as to say it surpasses my expectations, plus i though Keanu Reeves acting was fantastic!. I really found the dialog pretty cool, and the scenery was absolutely beautiful, plus it's wonderfully made and written as well!. This is one of the most underrated action films of all time as far as i'm concerned, and i personally loved the cast, plus Patrick Swayze was amazing! as the main villain. This is a wicked Action film, with some great surfboarding and sky diving stunts, and i say go see it now it's not to be missed!. The Direction is brilliant!. Kathryn Bigelow does a brilliant job here, with amazing camera work, incredible surfing and sky diving shots, and some other shots that blew me away, plus she kept the film at an extremely fast pace!. There is a bit of blood. We get tons of extremely bloody gunshot wounds, and some to the head. The Acting is wonderful!. Keanu Reeves is AMAZING as always, and is amazing here, he is very likable as the determined young FBI Agent, fantastic in the acting department, had pretty good chemistry with Gary Busey, and just did amazing job overall! (Keanu Rules!). Patrick Swayze is amazing as usual, and did a fantastic job here as the main villain, he was really cool, and i really dug his character!!(Swayze Rules!). Gary Busey is fantastic as usual and is great in his rare good guy role, he also had some classic lines! (Busey rules). Lori Petty is really good in her screen time, and was quite attractive i liked her lots, although her chemistry with reeves was off. John C. McGinley annoyed the crap out of me as usual and did his usual stuff. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see at all costs, don't miss it!. ***** out of 5</fullReview>

It actually appears to take itself seriously, even with the absolutely cornball plot devices and horribly miscast actors. Keanu Reeves in particular looks to be all of about 17 in the show, but is playing the part of a seasoned, streetwise FBI agent. Oh yeah, that works.If you're still fighting acne - or maybe are just amazingly credulous - this film might do it for you. Otherwise, I'd say "Pass"...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as I remembered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is there more of an enigma in Hollywood than Keanu Reeves? As many of his films as I've seen, I have never quite figured out if he is a fair actor, or a good actor, or even a great actor. I just know that I usually enjoy seeing him on screen, depending on the genre of the film. This may have been the first film I saw him in, and I was at least somewhat impressed.I think the movie -- at 123 minutes -- is overly long...particularly in the early portion when Reeves' character is learning to surf and trying to fit into the hippie-surfing scene. Frankly, this part of the film was slightly boring, although probably necessary to set up the rest of the story...it just could have been a little tighter. As we get more into Reeve's realization of who the bank robbers are, the action picks up and the film becomes more interesting.This film is unique in one way -- probably the only film in which I actually enjoyed the performance of Gary Busey. Just not my kind of actor.Reeves here is pretty good. Yes, he has a strange voice cadence, which I think lends to those who believe he is a very shallow actor. But, whether or not he's a good actor, he has screen presence, and that shows here.I have a difficult time judging Swayze's acting here. It just seems so not like him and he looks so ratty. Let's just say this is not his role that I find most impressive.The only 3 actors that really impress here are Reeves, Swayze, and Busey.I'm giving this film only a "5" rating. Despite the different setting, despite some darned good action scenes, the story just seems too preposterous from start to finish (e.g., Reeves' character chooses to jump out of an airplane without a parachute). Well...there is one bit of realism -- at the end of the film Reeves' character drops out of the FBI. Thank god. We don't need screw-ups like that in the FBI!</fullReview>
