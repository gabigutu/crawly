		<shortDescription>Romantic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film was on TV last night, and decided to check it out on IMDb. After reading the numerous negative comments, I was pretty skeptical and didn't really make an effort to get to the TV in time for it starting. What a mistake that was. My word, this was one funny film! Perhaps it's an acquired sense of humour, but in some parts I was laughing so hard my stomach hurt! It's certainly not a film that requires thought or is deep and meaningful in any way, but if you want a giggle, then Nine Months will definitely put a smile on your face. It did mine! The only downside is perhaps having such high profile stars in not very challenging roles. Aside from this, Nine Months is a light hearted comedy that really got me laughing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has its Moments, Has its FLAWS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Nine Months' is another typical romantic comedy. It has its funny moments. It has its unfunny moments (especially the toilet humour). While, in my opinion, the film could have been a great comedy, some of the humour is just flat and forced into the screenplay. Generally speaking, it's not a bad film.Chris Columbus's direction isn't exactly bad as he does manage to make 'Nine Months' a feel-good film. Hugh Grant doesn't seem like the ideal choice for the role. I just didn't find him convincing enough, even though he's known for his rom-com movies. Julianne Moore is a delight to watch even though her role is less comedic and challenging. Joan Cusack is hilarious. Tom Arnold is quite annoying but sometimes he's okay. Jeff Goldblum is adequate in a supporting role. Robin Williams's character seems forced.While things are a little light and slow in the beginning, it's in the last half hour that the writer puts a little too many comedy, most of it falling flat on its 'face'. With a cast like this, one would have expected better. I'd still say it's far more enjoyable than the likes of 'Runaway Bride' and 'Pretty Woman'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A puerile mixture of melodrama and farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is as subtle a kicking a house brick with your toe, and deeply dishonest.The comedic characters and events are from the era of the Keystone Cops; completely over the top. This film is from the genre of farce verging on melodrama, complete with music to make sure we know what we are supposed to think. It should have been honest enough not to pretend to anything more complex.The life challenges faced by the characters are real enough but the plot is completely cliché and obvious.The central characters are simplistic and are black &amp; white (she all good, he all bad). The dialog is from the day dreams of a fourteen year old.The fact that a film uses actor Hugh Grant does not make it sensitive, uplifting or funny. The fact that a film contains sex and slapstick does not make it a romantic comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An embarrassing mess!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nine Months can't make up its mind. Is it a romantic comedy? Is it fun-dumb slapstick? Is it a warm tale of family? Is it a comment on single yuppies? It tries to be all and ends up failing to be any. On the way, it is cliched, offensive, obnoxious, predictable, and DULL. Pity the poor cast, most of them respected actors, who must now find this idiocy forever on their resumes. On a few occasions, Nine Months just lets go into full-blown, bull moose lunacy, and in those moments it's a lot of fun. The ten minutes or so from the time Julianne Moore goes into labor until she gives birth are hysterical, certainly the best part of the movie. For the remaining 93 minutes, how many ways can I scream NO!? Shall I start with the relationship between Moore and Hugh Grant? They have been living together for five years, and both say they've been uncommonly happy, and yet they know little about each other. Grant THINKS, but isn't SURE, that Moore uses birth control. He has no clue that Moore wants children, nor does Moore have the least idea that Grant doesn't want them. They behave towards each other like a young couple in their first few months of getting to know each other. What about poor Joan Cusack, who hasn't got a single line to utter that isn't a cliche pulled off a radio call-in show? ?Birth is a miracle.' ?Family is what it's all about.' ?Sometimes husbands are frustrating but they come around.' Never ONCE does she say a single word that couldn't have been read off of the cover of Redbook. Or Tom Arnold, who thinks he's successfully playing a funny `big oaf' but is really just a creep? I'd believe him in a horror movie (as the horror) but not in a light comedy. Then there's the ENORMOUS misstep of making Hugh Grant a child psychologist, despite the fact that he's painfully uncomfortable around children. This is meant as comedy, but is so unbelievable, and so obviously detrimental to his clients, that it's just painful. Finally, what about the fact that two educated professionals seem to know nothing about reproduction or their own bodies? That isn't a joke, it's a tragedy!Finally, we have the hideous way that people treat each other, as though it's all funny. Is it funny that Julianne Moore packs up and leaves Hugh Grant, slamming the door behind her while he's trying to talk to her, because he's been distant and uninvolved? Yet HE is the one expected to apologize, `grow up,' and do her unreasonable bidding by the final reel. Yuck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts okay, but gets embarrassingly unfunny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very formulaic comedy in which most jokes bomb, especially the visual ones. Hopelessly clichéd sentimentality and schmaltz are quite annoying and the film really falls apart in the last third, mostly because of the double-birth scene which is incredibly lame and unfunny, clumsily "written" and directed; the gags in the birth scenes are so bad it's embarrassing to watch. Williams is solid. But I think Grant's charismatic-stutterer shtick is wearing a bit thin by now.Leonard Maltin, U.S. film critic and famous nerd, describes Julianne Moore as having "radiant beauty". What?! She's not ugly, but RADIANT BEAUTY?? The only thing that's radiant is Maltin's heavily damaged radio-active brain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting, but uninteresting story ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hugh Grant is pretty 'watchable' in most films he does. His on-screen presence is pretty much consists of witty lines, snappy articulation and boyish / non-threatening charm - and some element of nerves.He's got that same appeal in this movie - and with the over-the-top acting of Tom Arnold, the film has great comedic performances. Still though, it lacks a compelling story.The simple storyline never got interesting: an unmarried couple discovers they have a baby on the way. The soon-to-be father (Grant) seems uncomfortable with idea of becoming a responsible husband and father - leading to problems with the mother (Julianne Moore). Being in presence of a reckless family (headed by Arnold) just seems to make things worst ... and the story progresses from there.If you're a Grant fan, you'll enjoy his part in the movie. However, get ready to also discover that it isn't enough to save this movie. It's just not that fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a PARENT and I cringed all through this movie. This slop belongs in the early 1900s where the stereotypical woman conned a man into getting them pregnant then guilted him into marrying her.Why do men have to love the idea of being a father and aspire toward it? Parenting is a hard job and it shouldn't be trivialised, kids change everything about your life and you aren't you anymore. You're so and so's Mum/Dad or so and so's Grandparent for the rest of your life no matter how hard you try to keep your own life. People should be ready to have kids, not have it thrust upon them and be expected to change into Superparent on demand or be shunned like a leper.There are already too many hurt kids in this world who were born so their parents could have what they wanted, then decided they weren't what they wanted after all. Enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>''Nine Months'' is one of the coolest comedies I already watched in my life and even not being the best of them all, I think that ''5.2'' is a very low rate for it. It is a surprise to me to see that this movie was directed by Chris Columbus, since I always found his movie's style to be very different from the comedy genre. And it's funny to see the small role of Kristin Davis as the Tennis Attendant in this movie, after seeing the enormous success of Sex and The city series.Samuel has a nice and comfortable life: He has a beautiful girlfriend called Rebecca, has success in his psychiatric clinic, a beautiful red Porsche and everything he wished. But when Rebecca tells him that she is pregnant, his world drastically changes, specially because he doesn't want to have the baby and never actually thought about the idea of having kids. Many confusions will happen, specially with the annoying couple they met at the beach,Marty Dwyer and Gail Dwyer.-&gt;aka "Nove Meses" - Brazil</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very entertaining...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard this flick was pretty bad from the 'real' movie critics, and it even got panned on the Simpsons, so I knew I was in for it when my grandmother saw it starting on TV and proclaimed that she MUST see it. Apparently, she heard that it was a classic. She heard wrong. Now I did not see the entire movie, but about 45 minutes of it. This may make my review invalid in some people's eyes, but trust me, Nine Months could not possibly have saved itself. When you've been watching a comedy for over half an hour and have not laughed once, then it is safe to say that chuckle won't come. The jokes were either childish or outdated, like the running mantis gag (please) or Tom Arnold scolding his kids to stop eating someone else's food while he himself is stuffing his face with crackers (har har). And, I swear, do we really need to see "Let's Get It On" in another movie sex scene? I don't know how many times I've seen this excuse for comedy lately. They even used it in Austin Powers 2, so you'd think other movies would take a hint! To conclude, Hugh Grant is a skinny, pasty Brit with bad teeth and Tom Arnold used to be married to Roseanne. Yeah, two great leading men ladies and gentlemen. And if Hugh's character doesn't want to have kids, I don't blame him. We never see any children in this thing who actually act polite or nice, except from afar. Yeah, that's a mature way to decide you want a baby. Ah, look honey, that baby fifteen feet away is making a sand castle. PLANT YOUR SEED NOW! Never mind the fact that a baby costs MONEY, and it CRIES, no no. Since I did not see the entire thing, let's just leave this review without a score. Does that make everyone happy? Okay, great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie wasn't even entertaining enough to justify seeing it in the summer in order to enjoy two hours of air conditioning. It was immature and lowbrow, and relied way too much on slapstick (Tom Arnold and Hugh Grant fighting in a toy store; Julianne Moore's wheelchair plowing into a wall; etc.)Why can't there ever be a movie where someone who doesn't want children at the beginning STILL doesn't want them at the end? Why is "I don't want to be a parent" seen as a character flaw to be overcome, rather than a personal insight to be trusted?Lame, lame, lame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NINE MONTHS, in my opinion, is an excellent comedy that will make you laugh and feel good. If you ask me, Dr. Kosevich (Robin Williams) was a little too nervous at times. However, I was surprised that Robin Williams sported his accent for this movie. In addition, whenever Sam (Hugh Grant) and Rebecca (Julianne Moore) had a fight, I felt really bad. It's hard for me to explain why. Even so, when Sam and Marty (Tom Arnold) fought Arnie the Dinosaur (Charles Martinet), I laughed really hard. If you want to know why, you'll have to see the movie. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent comedy that will make you laugh and feel good to any Hugh Grant or Julianne Moore fan who hasn't seen it. You're in for lots of laughter, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must Be Watched With Pain Medication.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A child psychiatrist's (Hugh Grant) life is turned upside down when his girlfriend (Julianne Moore) becomes pregnant. Grant acts more childish than the brats he sees as his fears make him do the stupidest things. Also along for the ride are Russian doctor Robin Williams, struggling artist Jeff Goldblum and an odd married couple (Tom Arnold and Joan Cusack). The film is more of a slap-stick comedy than a cinematic creation. Grant, who was in the midst of being caught in Hollywood with a prostitute just before this film was released, ended up having the last laugh as the movie ended up being a mild box office success. That does not change the fact that the production is a pretty big mess from top to bottom. "Nine Months" goes for laughs and gets deflated very quickly. The little drama pinched in feels forced and never does become apparent. 2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Nine Months" is a predictable chick flick, where a very happy, content bachelor knocks up his live-in girlfriend, thereby turning his world upside-down. Lessons learned: men who don't want to marry and have children are portrayed as immature, self-absorbed, selfish, and misguided. Carting lots of screaming kids around in a minivan is, apparently, the most fun a man can have in this lifetime. For women, having children is the ultimate achievement and fulfillment of their lives. This is an insulting fairy tale that women will love, because it shows men who don't want marriage and kids as BAD and men who do want marriage and kids as GOOD. Women are always GOOD no matter what their attitude or actions are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Nine Months' is a romantic comedy film starring Hugh Grant as a boyfriend to a girl who has learned that she has just become pregnant. Hugh Grant's character must now learn how to be a grown up and how to be a good father, and he does not like this one bit. Nothing about this film really stands out among all of the other films in the genre. It's pretty forgettable, but it was fairly enjoyable when first viewed. Do not expect anything other than a typical Hugh Grant romantic comedy. In my opinion, it's pretty dull, but it does have its moments. I give it an average 5/10. It's okay but not special, and it is pretty forgettable; doesn't do anything for the genre or film history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hugh Grant and Julianne Moore are a great duo in this comedy. I cannot believe that this movie is rated 5.3, I was laughing my head off. And I can name 10 people off right now that said they were dying of laughter from this film. Yes, it is a little silly at times, but if you enjoy slapstick, this is the movie for you.Hugh Grant plays Samuel. A handsome and successful man who unexpectingly finds out that his girlfriend, Julian Moore, is having a baby. Of course he has his doubts about the baby while his girlfriend needs his support badly.It's a great movie. The only thing I can say is that Robin needs a little work on the accent.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is my first review on here. i never know what to write! but i had to write one for this.It was hilarious, i have been watching a lot of films lately and sometimes i stop watching about 15 mins in cos its been so boring, but this one was funny from the very start. i don't usually like slapstick on TV but its different in films. Hugh grant generally always plays the same kind of character, although he is brilliant at what he does, and nearly always has amazing chemistry with his co-stars. He is a little different in this but not much. Samuel can be a bit unfair at the start but understandable. I disagreed with someone who said Rebbecca didn't give him a chance,she did. in the scene at her dance school she asks if he wanted it too and he said yes. I've not seen Robin Windsor in many films but he was hilarious too. the only silly thing i thought was when Gail shouted YEES - she does the same thing in runaway bride LOL!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams Steals This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hugh Grant's first Hollywood feature film was made a year after Four Weddings &amp; A Funeral, and he co starred with Julianne Moore, who had been around awhile, appearing in small but significant roles in movies like 'Benny &amp; Joon' and 'The Fugitive'. Tom Arnold, Joan Cusack and Jeff Goldblum are all here giving good support, but it's Robin Williams who steals the movie as a nervous Russain doctor. Grant and Moore play a couple who have been in love for five happy years. Then she unexpectedly falls pregnant. She is happy about it, but he's horrified by the idea.It's hard to root for Grant as the hero of the piece as he is a selfishly, arrogant, self centred cliché of an unwilling Dad to be. The fact that he keeps seeing Arnold and Cusack and their brood of disruptive kids only ads his horror. I liked Arnold and Cusack so much, I actually thought they could have had their own spin off movie! Something in the vein of 'National Lampoons Vacation' Likewise Williams Russain doctor. He gives the movie it's only real big laughs. Something I need to point out, is Hans Zimmer's score, it is beautiful.Sadly this movie suffers massively from it's predictability. Everybody knows how it will end, the supposed fun is supposed to come on the journey to the obvious happy conclusion. But it's just not there, there is very little charm here and it's the fault of Grant's character being so selfish. Admittedly if he was supportive from the get go, we would not have much of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad; some miscasting; a truly hilarious finale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this film...although it took some effort to do so. Let's start with what's wrong with the film. First and foremost, I couldn't buy Hugh Grant as a child psychologist. That just didn't work for me. Additionally, at least at this phase of his life, he needed to tone up a bit. His body just looked non-sexual...in a film that is essentially about sex. And his modified page boy haircut. And I say all that as a person who generally likes Hugh Grant in films.The other thing that just doesn't seem to work here is Robin Williams' stint as a Russian obstetrician. I'm not quite sure why it doesn't work, and it does deliver a few laughs, but it just kinda lays there.Julianne Moore as the female lead does nicely, although this role seems out of her normal scope. Tom Arnold does okay as an overbearing friend. Even better is Joan Cusack as his wife, who rarely fails to make me laugh! Jeff Goldblum seems out of place here and in a role that is rather minor; he's a better actor than the rest in the cast, and deserves a better and more prominent role.So I'm sure it sounds as if I'm not recommending this film, but its saving grace is a truly funny conclusion once the water breaks...one that had me laughing out loud repeatedly...and I'm usually one who keeps his chuckles to himself. It made the movie worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is very hard to put into words why this movie is so important to me. It probably is because it captures the horrible reality of the realization that, as a man, your first child means that you have to jettison so much that you hold dear, but after you get over the initial horror, you begin to realize that your old life is immaterial and the new one is full of adventure and wonder. Yes, the film is full of flaws, but it captures - in a wonderful combination of sarcasm and slapstick - all of what a young couple has to experience. First, the "breeders", led by a great performance from Joan Cusack and Tom Arnold. Second, the "anti- breeders" led by Jeff Goldblum and his cast of girlfriends. And lastly, the "temptress" (Lilli)that represents all of the wild, carefree times that you think you are giving up but you realize is simply smoke and mirrors. This is the "coming of age" movie for fathers...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NINE MONTHS is about an expectant couple. To borrow a tagline from a Jeff Goldblum movie: Be afraid. Be very afraid. If the inanity doesn't kill you, the stupidity will.NINE MONTHS opens with Samuel and Rebecca (Hugh Grant and Julianne Moore) on a beach, assessing their couplehood, Samuel deciding he is happy, Rebecca intimating she is dissatisfied. (So what's new? She's a woman in a relationship - synonymous with "dissatisfied.") She speaks of her biological clock and other subjects men Do Not Hear - and we brace ourselves for a dull romantic comedy.Suddenly - Tom Arnold! With three spoiled brat kids and Joan Cusack screeching not far behind as his harridan wife. And we realize we're in for a dull, STUPID romantic comedy.Women are always complaining that men cannot know the pain of childbirth. By watching NINE MONTHS, each of us insensitive men can at last feel such pain.Based on a film written and directed by Patrick Braoudé, NEUF MOIS, Chris Columbus writes and directs NINE MONTHS like a brainless farce rooted in wrong: the wrong way to raise kids, the wrong way to behave during pregnancy, the wrong way to assess morality and the wrong way to medically process a birth (Robin Williams makes an embarrassing cameo as a Russian obstetrician who seems to have his accent confused with his asshole).Marty's (Arnold's) kids are such horrible snots that this movie shoots itself in the womb as it is trying to send the message that kids are precious.Jeff Goldblum is Sean, Samuel's best friend and sworn bachelor. And the high point of the movie - he's the B-character, but his presence is magnetic; it's like a professional has been called in to work amateurs. When he calls Marty's kids "monsters" - even though they are portrayed that way - he is regarded as perverse as a guy who turns into a human fly. When Sean describes how he dumped his girlfriend when she wanted to get pregnant, he is again painted as hilariously crazy, even though he is the most balanced character in the movie: "She chewed up my manhood, swallowed my youth... She wanted my seed, so I closed the iron door, denied her my essence!" And he left out the part about his baby being a maggot.When Rebecca falls pregnant, she tells Samuel she gets a kick out of "something living inside her." (Was she talking about Samuel's English pinewood during intercourse? Maybe she should talk to Geena Davis during that dream sequence birth.) For the record, girly, nothing is "living inside you" - your baby is a part of your metabolism. It IS you until it is birthed. If you want to talk about things living inside you with a sovereign metabolism, think about the billions of bacteria in your mouth or the bacteria that helps digest food in your villi. Got tapeworm? Why not a gerbil?Message comes through loud and stupid: Pregnant mothers are the best people in the world. The expectant father is Always Wrong. And getting to the hospital during labor is always going to be riddled with idiocy. And the sworn Monster Bachelor can't possibly be happy with a 25-year-old blond on his arm with "breasts like spongecake, calves like calzones and crazy about sex," because bachelors are men and Men Are Pigs. And though it is happening naturally in billions of organisms around the Earth, though the process of birth is no more outside the natural order of life than breathing, though there is nothing about pregnancy that defies logic or biology, whenever a women plops out an infant human being, it is somehow always - a Miracle.And then there's the other subliminal message that because the mother is pregnant, she HAS to get married to her live-in boyfriend before the birth, because heaven forfend if they're not married when the baby is born - it might be the anti-Christ or a maggot or something...Give her nine more months cleaning up vomit and cack - she'll miraculously be dissatisfied all over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hugh Grant is a good comedic actor but has little dramatic range. This much is obvious from the mediocre 'Nine Months'. There is little humor in the script which would have been totally devoid of laughter were it not for Robin Williams. Williams almost singlehandedly saves the film and his energy lifts the suitably manic climax. But the rest of the film is a hard slog. I didn't find Tom Arnold funny. Julianne Moore is a fine actress but the script hamstrings her. One nice touch - the end credits, which are unusual and quite pleasant to watch. The film is watchable but dull, certainly not worth a trip to the theater.Overall 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Nine Months" is a chick flick romcom about a happily unmarried couple (Moore &amp; Grant) who gets preggo and, well, has a baby. A big step down for kid flick director Chris Columbus, this tumble from messy to sappy to corny to slapsticky wouldn't be worth the time if it weren't for the comic contributions of Arnold, Williams, Cusack, and Goldblum. Moore (Shoulda been Sophie Marceau) seems uncomfortably out of place while Grant hams it up dutifully (stiff upper lip and all that) as the film becomes increasingly in need of creative substance slogging its way toward its sentimental conclusion. No brainer fluff stuff for young female sofa spuds. (C+)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In sixty years of movie-going I have sat through some clunkers but "Nine Months" is right up there with "I aim at the stars","Mrs Doubtfire" and "Johnny English" vying for the accolade "Worst of the worst".It is a movie with absolutely no merit whatsoever.It has Robin Williams, who clearly thinks he is one of the funniest men on the planet, in a small role. Unfortunately no one had the nerve to tell him it was a small role and he gives us his usual "lovable" foreign schmuck stereotype,shouting and waving his arms.His comical misuse of the word "Pussy" should have you rolling in the aisle.It has Tom Arnold in a rather bigger role.He too spends most of his time shouting and waving his arms in between "hilarious" attempts to kiss Hugh Grant.It also has Joan Cusack,a sort of madonna (with a small "m") figure worshipped for her fecundity.She too is very loud,her screams in labour are truly terrifying.And then there is Julianne Moore wafting through the movie half - heartedly,looking as though her mind is really on where she left her car keys.She is so disinterested she can barely be bothered to look at Hugh Grant,which is a sentiment I can at least have a certain sympathy for. Mr Grant never gets into first gear let alone out of it in the less - than - taxing part of the posh English shrink with a practice in San Francisco and a reluctance to have children without long and serious consideration,a remarkably sensible attitude that renders him an object of contempt and ridicule in this movie.He stutters a lot and closes his eyes to express deep emotion,furrowing his brow then,in desperation, resorts to shouting and waving his arms like everybody else. In the last reel Mr Grant gets round to seeing that "fatherhood",even if accidental, is a "Good Thing" and flies to Miss Moore's side to be present at what must be the most protracted and noisiest birth scene in the movies.Mr Williams dispenses with acting altogether,simply bouncing off various bits of scenery(the very few left unchewed)like a demented pinball. Un point then for "Neuf Mois",to give it the title of the French original,and,believe me,it struggled to reach that.</fullReview>

The Praying Mantis should have eaten Grant, adapted Woody Allen's voice,claimed to be the father, married Moore and devoured the child factory. We would have had a funnier film.

		<shortDescription>Just a poor girl movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thanks a lot Hollywood for making me feel like I'm not worth much. No, I'm not a father yet, but if my girlfriend would tell me that she's pregnant, my world would probably almost collapse at the first moment and apparently that's not the way you should react. This movie tries to make you believe that having a child is everybody's moral duty. We all should make a few dozen babies to find eternal happiness. I'm very sorry but that is just a bunch of ultra conservative Christian crap!!! I know, my reaction is perhaps a bit strong, but this time it all really bothered me too much.At first the movie starts very promising. It's funny to see how he reacts when he hears the news that she's pregnant, that his perfectly organized life will be completely turned upside down, ... but as the movie progresses it gets a pedantic tone, which I really didn't like. I agree that the movie had funny parts (for instance the praying mantis part was absolutely brilliant), but it never seemed to stick to a certain genre. Sometimes it was slapstick, than drama, than comedy, than a romantic movie... What bothered me about this movie as well, is the use of so many stereotypes. Men are pigs when it comes to having children, babies are miracles, a man acts and reacts like a child... All in all this is just a poor girl movie that confirms many of their ideas about men and children. It has some decent, but far from excellent acting in it, but doesn't know where it wants to go. I give it a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess the producers must have thought that the success of "Four Weddings and a Funeral" would make any film with Hugh Grant a goose with golden eggs. Well duh, this film is simply a waste of pellicule. The humour makes me cringe, especially the little number Robin Williams shows us with the gyneacological table. Tom Arnold was terrible too, a typical American stereotype. Anyone who can watch the scene with the deliveries without whimpering deserves a medal of honour.I doesn't even deserve the 1 out of 10 I gave it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cute, and yes, I'll second the 'mindless fun' part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that is part of a genre that you watch on cable once, think it's cute and kinda' funny, and never watch again. But somehow, this movie has stayed in my brain as being EXCEPTIONALLY funny. Although the premise sounds dreadfully cliche, Chris Columbus was REALLY on the mark with this one, on all levels. The humor is perfect in timing. Robin Williams has a funny part, but not a big one, which is a good thing in my book. He's used just right, mainly as slapstick. Then, there's Jeff Goldblum, who I usually find to be annoying, in his pseudo-intellectual roles. In this one, he provides a lot of light humor, along with compassion for his best friend. Hugh Grant's humor is just that: Hugh Grant's humor, a kind of slapstick that can work well in this type of film. Tom Arnold and Joan Cusack are their humorous selves, but with a twist. They are both very believable as 'mom' and 'dad', with their characters seeming a bit more innocent than their previous roles(this is Chris Columbus, after all.) There is plenty of character development for Grant's char., though the best part of the movie is its humor. It's not cheesy-funny, but really hilarious.I definitely recommend this one if you want to laugh!-Sep </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even the scenery of San Francisco can't save this movie. Among the unimaginative episodes is a nonsensical night-time race across the city that results in several personal injuries who are loaded into the car along with an hysterical laboring Julianne Moore. At least if it had been daytime, we could have enjoyed the hills of the city and some of its architecture. The movie is formulaic. The women are whiny and manipulative. The men are immature and clueless. There's only one real adult, but she has a minor role. There's a pack of dreadful children who remain uncivilized and don't improve. There's a stereotyped foreign obstetrician. We're fed varied misinformation about pregnancy and childbirth. Newborns are played by two-month-old babies right there in the delivery room. There are three major actors in this film: their talents are wasted. And need I add that Hugh Grant plays a child psychologist who has no idea how to do his job and appears unaware of that fact. This is supposed to be humorous. There is a small plus: the closing credits include baby photos of the six main characters. Too little, too late.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple fun rom-com punctuated by the funniest labour scene ever!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nine Months was always one of my little guilty pleasures. Its not exactly brilliant and its entirely by the book and simple but has a little charm and is easy to watch. The film does have a great comedic cast and everyone seems to work really well together. I was a little surprised at how low this film scores and also some of the harsh reviews. At the very least its very entertaining. The pacing of the film is great, there is lots of emotional moments and I like it because there is a great balance of ying and yang to it meaning girls will love the heart and romance and guys will enjoy the male presence in the film too. Its just zany fun. Now I admit I'm a bit of a sucker for really good physical comedy and this film has it in spades. I'm not sure there has been a comedy since that uses that kind of comedy antics to make you laugh and it does it so well in my opinion. Now despite the fact that the first 3/4 of the film is simple and straight forward the last climatic scene of this movie is pure comedy gold. It is a riot watching this couple give birth to their son. Its antics unlike anything else out there and easily one of my favourite scenes in a film.Hugh Grant had a great career for a long time. He was King of the romantic comedies and the likable everyman. He is quite good in this playing a little bit stuck up but a guy who really tries. He's just very likable and you want to be his buddy and you understand him and he leads the cast well. His character doesn't exactly get a lot of depth but he pulls it off. Julianne Moore is decent as his loving girlfriend who gets pregnant. I wouldn't say she really stands out in the film, this is really more about Grant but she plays her part well and they have good chemistry. Tom Arnold and Joan Cusack are the stereotypical "best friend" roles although Arnold and Grant have this fun rivalry that really is a great part of the movie. Arnold was very good at being the obnoxious buddy type role and he and Cusack are really great together. The four of them are literally the reason to watch this film. Jeff Goldblum has an unfortunately small role as Grant's buddy who is a womanizer but has life lessons to teach. Goldblum is great but the role is too small. And then...the incomparable, much missed, comedy genius...Mr. Robin Williams. God I loved this man. No one did comedy like he did. This is Williams at his best. He's a neurotic, scared, Russian doctor who has never actually delivered a baby. His one liners are spot on and his physical comedy is unbelievable. He is drop dead hilarious in this film.Honestly, Chris Columbus is a genius in so many ways. He does these mainstream, almost typical cookie-cutter drama/comedies but they're also just incredibly entertaining. His films are easy to watch with great characters and he always has a great cast behind him. I wouldn't say Nine Months is one of his best but it certainly showcases the kind of film he is great at. This is just one of those films that you have to go in with the right expectations and just sit back and enjoy it. I say this a lot but people take movies like this too seriously. Sometimes (in fact most times) movies should be simple and fun and just entertain you and Nine Months absolutely does that. My beautiful wife and I watched this tonight and she is just about eight months pregnant so we got to laugh at the idea of what giving birth might mean for us. Its just fun people!! Enjoy it. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a really enjoyable movie that is easy to watch any time it comes on television. There are some scenes that are a little unbearable to watch like the trip to the hospital. What the hell is wrong with him and if this was real life they would have plowed through a brick wall driving like that.I feel that this movie truly proves that in life not everybody should become parents. There are the couple who believe loving their kids and not disciplining their children makes them understanding and good parents. In reality those "breeders" are bad parents and should be forced into parenting classes. Then there's the couple who have no idea what they are doing which turns them into complete and utter baboons, well Hugh Grant's character at least. I find it funny because it seems so outrageous but the problem is there are many people like this. Thank god many parents seem to have some common sense and instinct. But all in all it is quite funny if you can move past the cringe factor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple and predictable about a reluctant father-to-be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not an original movie. The story is very common and very simple: a man is told that he is going to be a father. At first, he is very ambivalent. He feels trapped into something he never wanted. But in time (of course...) he comes around, marries his girl-friend, and becomes a wonderful, loving father and husband. *yawn* It is too obvious, predictable, and simple, and that goes for the humour as well. I think it was a waste to have such a great and handsome actor as Hugh Grant in it.But still... this is a story that very many people can relate to. Lots and lots of families the world over have started just like this, with a woman who wants to become a mother, even if she has to do it all alone - and a man who is very reluctant at first. For everybody who can recognize this story from his/her own life, it can be well worth watching. Once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As A Comedy It Fails, But It's Still Not A Bad Movie Overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a strange movie in a lot of ways. It's supposed to be a comedy except that it really isn't very funny, there are some issues involved with the casting and the characters, and while it's a comedy that isn't all that funny (or, for that matter, a romance that isn't all that romantic) there are parts of it that actually work reasonably well.Hugh Grant (who plays Samuel) is not someone I consider to be an "A" list actor. He's pretty one dimensional - always seeming to play variations on the same character: the lost and confused romantic, whose life just isn't working out the way he wants. As Samuel, he's a guy who has it pretty good. He's a successful child psychologist, he's living with a beautiful woman (Rebecca, played by Julianne Moore) and everything's great until the day Rebecca tells him that she's pregnant. Samuel has no dreams of being a father, and his life and relationship with Rebecca go downhill from there. The most interesting part of the movie to me was watching Samuel's evolution from a guy who was totally uninterested in fatherhood to being a guy desperate to hold on to his new family. Grant did well with the role. He didn't overwhelm - he never does; he's just not that type of actor - but he was solid.The weaknesses in this movie revolved around the comedic elements. Yes, there were some funny moments, but there weren't enough truly funny moments for this to qualify as a really solid comedy. The real problem was that the movie often tried too hard to be funny. It went way overboard. That was, in part, a problem with the cast. Tom Arnold was cast as Marty Dwyer. He and his wife meet Samuel and Rebecca at the start of the movie. His wife Gail is also having a baby, and the two couples enter into a sometimes reluctant relationship. I've never been a big fan of Arnold, and once again he grates on me a little bit here, and his character comes across as irritating rather than funny. Then there was Robin Williams as Dr. Kosevich, the obstetrician who has just arrived from Russia and has never delivered a human baby before. Williams puts on a pretty typical, slapstick Robin Williams performance in the role - but this character was way too over the top and added very little to the movie except a real feeling of total unbelievability.And yet, watching Samuel grow in his level of comfort with pending fatherhood is satisfying. He makes a difficult evolution from a character at the start of the movie for whom you have very little sympathy, to a character who becomes very sympathetic, and who you end up rooting for as he tries to put the pieces of his life back together. You expect that a degree of comedy might come from the idea that Samuel is a child psychologist who doesn't want children, but that really isn't central to the movie (and, all things considered, I can actually see why a child psychologist might not want children - after all, he's going to see all the problems!) It's just watching him grow from a guy who's part selfish and part frightened to a guy increasingly comfortable and then even enthusiastic about fatherhood. The ending is perhaps a bit sappy, but also very appropriate to the story.It's not a great comedy. If you want something to give you a lot of laughs - look elsewhere. But it's not a bad movie really, if you can get past the excesses of Arnold and Williams. (6/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nine Months</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title when I heard sounded like a pretty obvious premise, and with a good cast list I thought I wouldn't mind it, from director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone). Basically child psychiatrist Samuel Faulkner (Hugh Grant) and ballet teacher Rebecca Taylor (Julianne Moore) have been boyfriend and girlfriend for five years, and never thought to commit to each other, i.e. marriage and kids. But things are about to change when Rebecca reveals that she is pregnant, and Samuel is panicking at the thought of being a father, but he is trying too hard to go along with what she wants. The pressures of fatherhood are made even worse with the constant irritation of encounters with the overbearing Dwyers, Marty (Tom Arnold) and also pregnant Gail (Joan Cusack), and some confusing advice from his single artist friend Sean Fletcher (Jeff Goldblum). Samuel and Rebecca go to see the doctor replacing the one they had in mind to do the delivery, the Russian and not very experienced Dr. Kosevich (Robin Williams), and this doesn't do any favours for Samuel either. When he misses another of the many scans they were meant to do together, Rebecca decides that Samuel is not involved enough in the pregnancy and knows he is not keen on the idea at all, so she leaves him. Alone, Samuel does watch the ultrasound video of his baby son growing inside his partner, at for the first time, he feels something for the new life he has created. After getting his head together, Samuel realises he loves Rebecca too much to let her go, and he finally feels confident enough to have a baby, and of course that is the point when her water breaks. A rush to the hospital causes some accidents along the way, a few people get injured and are forced to get in the car to go there as well, but they make it. They are not happy to see Dr. Kosevich again as the one to do the delivery, but as the only doctor who can, they, and the Dwyers right next to them have no choice. In the end, after the squabbles and the complaining from both the males and females, the two babies are delivered successfully, the Dwyers have another daughter, and Rebecca and Samuel are happy together with their baby son. Also starring Mia Cottet as Lili and Joey Simmrin as Truman. Just before the release Grant was caught with Hollywood prostitute Divine Brown, but I don't think it marred his career whatsoever, in this he still puts on the modern Cary Grant thing he brought to Four Weddings. Moore is reliable as Grant's pregnant other half, Arnold is a little annoying, Cusack is alright, Goldblum has his moments, and Williams makes the most as the manic obstetrician. The film is layered with some mild laughs, it has all the usual sentimental stuff involved for the baby premise, and the script could have used a tiny bit more work, not such a bad comedy. Okay!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a kid, after returning from School and wrapping up home-work, I remember watching 'Nine Months' a number of times. It was my favorite film then. Now when I look at this film, and when I think about the memories attached to it, I still kinda love it. Director Chris Columbus made my day as a kid.'Nine Months' was not a path-breaking, $300 million rich film, nor was it liked by the pseudo critics. It was a story that wanted an audience, which fortunately it got! The entire idea of a would-be-dad freaking out to his pregnant partner is an interesting thought for a romantic-comedy. Chris Columbus's direction was good. Another aspect that worked big time in here, were it's simply weird characters. Tom Arnold &amp; Joan Cusack were the memorable characters and performers, while Hugh Grant &amp; Julianne Moore managed as the lead performers. Jeff Goldblum did his part well, while Robin Williams was lovable and wild as an Obstetrician and Gynaecologist.I love this film... I've got memories attached to it.

Samuel goes over to his friend's house and Samuel isn't suppose to be there. His friend says that it's his mom and his wife says that she's dead and he says, "I know it's really weird." That's the only funny part in the movie and it isn't even that funny of a scene. Even the delivery room scene is a waste because they fight right in the middle of the birth. That wasn't worth watching it at all. It isn't that great of a movie to watch unless you're a nervous father to be. Then that might make father more nervous. It's just a lame movie.</fullReview>

I know you will say I am French and I try to defend the movies of my country. You are right but "Neuf mois" is really worth it. Check out the comments of people from other countries. In the French version Patrick Braoudé is excellent. Hugh Grant is a very good actor and doesn't deserve to play in such a bad movie. They missed all the good energy and jokes that were in the original version. Also Hugh Grant cannot play like Patrick Braoudé. They don't have the same way of behaving. One is more discrete and acts with his eyes and the other one is just crazy. Patrick Braoudé as crazy as he is can make you realize that you would do the same as him in such a situation. So the conclusion is: skip the remake, watch the original one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugh and Julianne just don't fit together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love both Hugh Grant and Julianne Moore and watch all their movies, but somehow on the screen they do not fit. There's been not a single moment during the whole film that would make me believe they are actually a couple. Hugh can act great with a number of actresses from Julia Roberts to Martin McCutcheon and Julianne passes to a superb partner to Pierce Brosnan - but I'd have never thought to put them together on one screen.The movie is about a middle aged couple, Samuel and Rebecca, who live together and have the usual no commitment-no worries lifestyle. But Rebecca suddenly discovers that she will have a baby and this is where the story begins.The first part of the movie was great, but afterwards there's too much overacting with exaggerated jokes. Less of the jokes would have been better and I would have been happier for more development of the inner feelings and development of Samuel and Rebecca. The end of the movie was a big disappointment for me; I expected something more serious and intimate.Hugh Grant plays quite well these romantic comedy roles, but after the tenth comedy from him, it is getting boring. He remembers me to Meg Ryan, who did excellent in 'When Harry Met Sally' and in 'Sleepless in Seattle', but since then I see almost the same smiles, gestures, interpretations again and again from her. As for Julianne Moore, she just surprised me with her wonderful interpretation in 'Far From Heaven' or in the 'Hours', but ever since then, she's just doing average. 'The Forgotten', the 'Laws of Attraction' are OK movies, but she can do much better than these. I hope she will come out soon with a film where she can show what she is capable of.So, there are just too many silly jokes in this film to be a comedy, and it only got an average acting performance. In fact, I would rather classify this movie as 'Family', as I think kids would really enjoy this kind of stuff. But as a comedy, it only gets 5/10 at me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so here's the deal. Take director Chris Columbus (Harry Potter) stars Hugh Grant (Four Weddings, Notting Hill, Love Actually), Julianne Moore (Oscar winner) and sprinkle with a little Robin Williams and you can't fail - right? Sadly wrong this is so gruesome it must have seen theatre goers leaving in droves before the end. I do not want to write a "spoiler" review and might accept that if you spend your life with romantic novels, think that TV soaps are the height of sophistication and have lost part of your neural reasoning you might survive to the end. But if you still have half an operable brain instead of spending 90 minutes with this drivel you would be better advised to lock yourself away in a dark room and contemplate the meaning of life.There actually isn't a plot (girl gets pregnant - father worries - that's a plot??). The characters are quite believable (so this is reality TV?) - but quite unappealing. Robin Williams gives a master class on over-acting (this is how NOT to do it students). Moore is lovely and so is Grant (but we knew that already). San Francisco is a lovely city and makes a good backdrop for a movie (likewise). I suppose that every actor and director is allowed one turkey and its good that such a talented team got it over with in "Nine Months". I suppose that it does show how difficult movie making is - but start with a good writer (e.g. Richard Curtis or JK Rowling...) and you won't go far wrong. "Nine Months" looks like it was written by a team from Mills and Boon - and it seems to last as long as its title when you watch it.</fullReview>

But I must say upfront that I had not heard a single good thing about this film from any of my friends. Perhaps because of this my judgement was clouded, as while watching the film tonight for the first time I had the urge to take my own life.What a lamentable waste of talent and money. The best thing about it was Robin Williams, who probably made up his part as he went along. Dreadful, awful, horrible. Hollywood at his worst. Perhaps Hugh Grant had his "Divine" moment to try to detract attention from how bad this film is? Wasn't this his Hollywood debut? Crap. Sh*t. Sucked the big one.I don't mind Hugh Grant; he can be very good ("Notting Hill", "An Awfully Big Adventure" - a really great film, "Bridget Jones' Diary"). I love Julianne Moore; she rarely makes any bad films. Tom Arnold. Has he made any GOOD films? Joan Cusack. Good in most things. But this film is an albatross of a movie.I didn't like it, but you might have guessed that.I really hope that all of the actors were well paid for the pleasure of appearing in this movie as I cannot imagine what else any of them got out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I draw the line here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As if we didn't get enough torture watching Hugh Grant (and others) belittle us with down right "dribble" with Four Weddings and a Funeral, we now have to deal with Grant (and a new batch of conspirators) in this one.I saw the previews, and I thought I would being seening an enjoyable commedy (especially with Robin Williams, the King of Comedy, in it). What I saw, however, was something all together different. This "comedy," how dare they even call it that, was nothing more than a drama trying to pay off to the movie world as a comedy...and failing misserably. I paided money to see a comedy, not a drawn out and horrible drama about this couple and the nine months leading to their first born child. The film focused mainly on Hugh Grant, its greatest mistake, and we are forced to watch him once again prove to us that he can not act! Nine Months...it almost felt like it was that long.Only redeeming quality of this film was Robin Williams who, once again, proved that he is the King of Comedy. His scenes made the film almost bare-able to watch...almost.Don't waste your money seeing this film...OR ANY HUGH GRANT FILM for that matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nine months is dull comedy and it is not funny. It has the stupid 90's american comedy style. Robin Williams is the saver of the film. Especially one stupid scene is in the near the end where they drive a car, it is so stupid. I would give this *? stars out of ***** (2 out of 10).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They should have just made it a Robin Williams movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so HOW MANY TIMES has pregnancy been the basis for a comedy?! Well, they mostly didn't add anything in "Nine Months". The scene with the dinosaur was actually quite funny, but there was little else that we haven't seen before. Robin Williams was actually the best character, as a manic Russian gynecologist (yeah, like an immigrant's really going to get to be a gynecologist in this country). If Hugh Grant's little fiasco right before this movie's release changed anything, it only affirmed that he's little more than a playboy. But considering that the movie stars him and Tom "what other memorable things have I done" Arnold, what can one expect? Julianne Moore, Joan Cusack and Jeff Goldblum also star, but I think that everyone can agree that they've done much better than this, as has director Chris Columbus.Still, that scene with the dinosaur was pretty funny. Just imagine how cool it would have been if Robin Williams had done it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much! Too Bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having put up with Cameron Diaz and Matt Dillon in "There's Nothing About Mary", in the same week I have to go through the insufferable Hugh Grant with Julianne Moore doing her utmost in this embarassingly trite "Nine Months". I mean, after recovering from the totally untitillating "Notting Hill", you will quite understand that romantic comedies are basically silly little love-stories with happy little endings that are no more than trivial light-hearted escapism. Quite frankly, my reaction is that this is excessive - just too much for any codger like me whose intellectual capacity at least rivals that of my little Husky.Anyway, waste of time saying anything about the Hollywood movie industry being under an obligation to serve up more serious fare......Too bad!</fullReview>

When I saw it got surprisingly good comments here, I just had to react! Incredibly boring, not a funny sentence! That's it. If you're really bored one evening, not looking for a comedy, but a dull drama about a silly man getting a baby though he doesn't want to - I guess it is possible to watch it. 3 out of 10. That's all. The 2 main players make their worst appearances ever in this one, and it must be the directors and writers fault!</fullReview>

My husband and I gamely watched the first hour, and finally could take no more. I was disappointed in Julianne Moore's performance, though she did not have much to work with given the awful script. Hugh Grant was whiney and annoying. Not even Robin Williams helped this mess.

		<fullReview>Nothing special about 9 1/2 months. I saw it on the Lifetime Channel and I'm not sure how it ever made it to the big screen. There's very little chemistry between Grant and Moore. Grant's character seems quite inept at working through his emotions about being a dad. A good child psychologist would probably have some idea about his feelings for fatherhood. And he'd have collegues he could turn to.Oh and did I mention the jokes are forced and not all that that funny? Well, the movie isn't hillarious. I like Hugh Grant in many movies...but this isn't one them. If you like romantic comedies or moives about pregnancy you might enjoy this. Otherwise skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't get how some of you people could not like "Nine Months". OK, perhaps some scenes were too cushy and sentimental, but the laugh to running-time ratio is surprisingly high. This may be branded as a chick-flick but there's comedy here for everyone. The film is basically a combination of different styles of wit from the six main stars and the result is surprisingly good.Hugh Grant does his usual high class, bumbling gentleman thing, Tom Arnold does his annoying best-friend neighbour routine, Jeff Goldblum as the decidedly cynical artist with a skeptical view of everything, Joan Cusack as the kooky ditz, Robin Williams as the inept foreign doctor and Julianne Moore plays it straight. There's also a great mix of verbal and slapstick wit that doesn't go un-noticed (the preying mantis joke is a laugh-riot).For the most part, "Nine Months" is a welcome change from your usual fluffy, smiley rom-com. I have absolutely no idea why people don't like the movie because I think it's great. My IMDb rating: 7.2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Samuel Faulkner has it good. He lives a semi-bachelor life but has a steady girlfriend. When she announces she's pregnant he fears the worst and isn't very supportive. Soon she's off but he learns a lesson from his friend Sean and tries to get back with her.Chris Columbus romantic comedies are never going to be the cutting edge of variety and innovation ? but this is just plain old and lame. The story could have been written by a child it is so predicable, with little funny lines ? and you know you're in the s**t when it falls back into a 10 minute keystone cops style conclusion. There are two funny scenes ? one with Robin Williams and one where a Barney-esque (Arnie) dinosaur gets the live kicked out of it in a toy store. This was made the most interesting bit in the film for me simply because Arnie was played by Charles Martinet ? who has done the voice of Super Mario in video games for the past decade or so.Outside of pop cultures references like these the film relies of coy, sickly sentiment and dumb jokes. Robin Williams' Russian doctor gets a few chuckles but the rest is lame. Grant is not the most versatile actor in the world but here he just plays his floppy haired, blinking fop to death. He even gets to re-do his opening speech from 4 Weddings (but with the language toned down for the American audience). He's annoying from start to finish. Moore deserved so much better and will probably see this as one of her lows on her CV. Arnold is terrible and Cusack is wasted. Jeff Goldblum is the only one is resembles a real person and is good, and Williams is hammy but at least manages to raise a few smiles.Overall this is terrible. A star looking for a break in America signs up to do a sure-thing (a soapy romantic comedy) with lots of big names around to protect him in his first big US movie. People criticised Grant for being with a whore just after this movie came out ? but they missed the fact that, by selling out and buying into clichéd American s**t that panders to the least demanding of audiences, he'd whored himself out just as much as Divine Brown had.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah... a romantic comedy from the '90s. Hugh Grant is a successful therapist, high-flying, Porche-driving, skinny, pasty dude with a British accent, i.e. he's got everything going for him. Through an astonishing lack of communication and birth control knowledge his girlfriend gets knocked up and immediately decides that his whole life needs to change or she's outta there, like trading his 2-seater Porche for a boring family car and shopping at Walmart to "save money". In the paranoid thinking of the time, she even wants him to get rid of his elderly cat out of fear of toxoplasmosis. His freakin cat!Not surprisingly he nopes outta that sh*t and of course now he's the bad guy that just needs to grow up. Bad friends and worse family convince him that his former rock-star lifestyle was empty and cheap, and explain that as soon as he looks into his new baby's eyes "everything will make sense". Didn't matter that he was a successful professional, good looks, nice car, no. Really, the "grow up" part is code for "make it all about her." And make it all about her he does! Cue a bunch of 50's-60's R+B as Hugh thoughtfully thinks of the baby and his shrew girlfriend, and reads "What to expect when you're expecting", cause of course, the 90's were all about convincing men that when your wife is pregnant, you better get double preggers or you're a deadbeat, man. I know I'm harping on the emasculation angle, but boy does this film roll in it. The estrogen pours off the screen in buckets as already effeminate Hugh Grant gets what last, scant evidence of his manhood sand-blasted away by Moore's Oscar- worthy rendition of a charmless, moody harpy. At least if Hugh is gonna throw it away, convince us that Julianne is maybe slightly worth it, but no, she vacillates between wounded bird whose man has abandoned her, and humorless, uncompromising chore. I give this one 2 stars just because it's a cautionary tale to remind young men to use proper birth control, but I simultaneously warn it may inflict thoughts of wanting to stab oneself in the neck with a pencil to distract from the on-screen agony. Watch this if you hate your life and would like to see another's destroyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>so many annoying characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Child psychologist Samuel Faulkner (Hugh Grant) is in a perfect happy relationship with Rebecca Taylor (Julianne Moore). That is until she brings up the M word "Marriage". They are hounded by married couple Marty (Tom Arnold) and Gail Dwyer (Joan Cusack) with their rambunctious daughters. Rebecca tells Samuel that she's pregnant. Their friend Sean Fletcher (Jeff Goldblum) is perpetually single with a series of young girlfriends. Kosevich (Robin Williams) is a weird Russian doctor with bad English. Samuel keeps whining. Rebecca eventually leaves Samuel and moves in with the Dwyers.I usually like Hugh Grant's hamming and hawing in his rom-coms. This commitment phobic version is much less endearing and rather annoying. For some reason, Tom Arnold keeps showing up like a bad rash. Jeff Goldblum's character is equally horrible. The whole movie is one annoying character after another. The broad comedy could have worked if I actually care about anybody in this movie. In a fight between Samuel and Marty, I root for a double knockout. I'd probably also throw in Robin Williams and Jeff Goldblum into the ring. Julianne Moore is rather bland but has a couple of funny moments. Director Chris Columbus is somehow tone deaf and the praying mantis is very creepy. The jokes keep falling flat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is right is to produce 4 of incredibly annoying, rude, out of control brats and become the kind of people everyone find annoying because they are nothing but parents anymore. At least this is the message of this movie.This movie is all about cliché gender stereotypes which are equally insulting to both men and women. Men are the ones who act like little babies staring fights in toy stores and be all terrified about pregnancy. And women are annoying bitches with a stick up their bum who don't like fun and are incredibly baby crazy. This is all they want, babies!!! And of course if you want to have a baby you have to "grow up". This means abandon your 16 year old cat. Very disgusting to see a movie promoting such thing, treating animals as objects that can be given away whenever you don't feel like it. I know some reading this will say: "But this is just a mooooooviiiiiieeee.". Well, yes it is, and i am aware that no cat was harmed while filming it. But at the same time: how many hysterical preggos got rid of their poor pets because they watched it and got scared about a "disease".When it comes to what i discussed before: gender stereotyping. Some comedies can get away with it, when they are funny. But this one can't even be qualified as a real comedy. Way too much cheese in it to be funny.And when they get funny sometimes they go way too far and become more than a comedy but some slapstick. Which doesn't have to be bad, actually my favorite part of this movie is the trip to the hospital. But a slapstick is good when it is a slapstick, and not mainly a child promoting, non-parents shaming melodrama.I think the actors are good, but this didn't help the fact that I hated the characters and all the movie. The only exception could be Robin Williams.Can't really give this movie a good rating. A good cast and 2 scenes which I liked can't make it up for the fact that the rest of the movie was very bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hugh Grant, Juliane Moore could be a knocking couple for this movie, but the lines and the action makes it an average film, which respects the typical comedy story. It could be much more, but Chris Columbus (the director) didn't manage to take an ordinary story to an extraordinary extent, even though he had the material (and here i refer to the actors which are first class).I don't know what it is your opinion, but i am fed up with this kind of soft movies, made just to be made. I think a movie should be more than laughter and good time for the viewer; it should have a strong idea and make you think about the world you live in. And it definitely should not be too optimistic because life is not.I don't recommend this movie, not even if you want to laugh and have a good time. If that is what you expect from a movie than you'd better watch American Pie or other like that one, which you know from the start they don't have any hidden theme or idea to think about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't love this movie, I can't hate it either. It just exists, and does very little more than that. As usual Hugh Grant plays Hugh Grant, but his heart doesn't really seem in it this time. He has no chemistry whatsoever with Julianne Moore, both stars seem satisfied with merely remembering their lines. They look more like brother and sister than anything else, that can't be what they were going for. Most of the fun is supposed to come from zany secondary characters, but only Robin Williams manages to really get some laughs. His scenes are the highlights of the movie, I'll let you decide whether or not that's a good thing. Just thinking of this movie sorta tires me really, it's that bland. I don't really find it bad, it just leaves me so completely indifferent, which in a way is even worse. "Nine Months" will not change anyone's life, but it's watchable when you have absolutely nothing useful to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Depending on your comedic taste and if you like Hugh Grant you won't be disappointed by Nine Months.Ever afraid of commitment, Grant's character, Samuel, has it all - well certainly as much as he is comfortable with. With a successful practice as a child psychotherapist, pretty girlfriend (Julianne Moore), an age old cat and a Porsche, life couldn't get any more demanding. However, unbeknown to Samuel, his girlfriend Rebecca is starting to feel as though something is missing from life - a child.During a drive home one day, whereby Samuel is voicing his disapproval of modern parenting and the amount of troubled kids he has to deal with, Rebecca announces she is pregnant which causes him to crash the car in disbelief. In spite of the pregnancy being purely accidental, Samuel begins to feel like a rabbit caught in the headlights and inwardly cowers at the thought of how his perfect and self-serving existence may have to be compromised.What follows is his deceitful and feigned interest in his unborn child once it becomes evident that Rebecca wants to keep the baby. But as the pregnancy progresses his indifference becomes clear to Rebecca as he misses or turns up late for scans, protests when he is told by the doctor that his cat will have to be re-homed and that his beloved Porsche will have to be traded in for a family friendly alternative.Throw in his friend (played by Jeff Goldblum), his friend's sister, husband and three errant kids who are nothing but a harsh omen of what the future holds and both external chaos and inner turmoil ensue.Hugh Grant is a master at portraying the suppressed British buffoon and this movie is by no means an exception. Will he eventually accept he must grow up and take responsibility or will he call time on what he once cherished as a relaxed and chaos free partnership?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did enjoy most of Nine Months, my favourite part was the ride to the hospital, that was hilarious, and Robin Williams was priceless. Nine Months was nice to watch, but some of it is uneven. Hugh Grant is dashing in the lead, and Julianna Moore as his love interest likewise. However there are other parts that didn't work quite as well. Jeff Goldblum is at least watchable, but the usually excellent Joan Cusack gives a fairly miserable performance as Gail Dwyer. The script has its ups and downs where the humour felt forced, likewise with the story, where some parts were overly sentimental and hurt the pace at times. Nine Months certainly isn't a terrible movie, it just didn't work as much as it had potential to have. 6/10 for a valiant effort. Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tend to either find Grant irritating or good, in his roles. Arnold is almost invariably the former. Williams, always great. So you can see how I couldn't entirely turn this one down, when it aired on TV, and the price was right. Last-mentioned is one of the funniest things about this, in his short but sweet part. The comedy is pretty much in the positive end of the spectrum, if some of the material falls flat. It's relatively simple, and it works. The plot is fine, and develops decently throughout. The editing isn't half bad. The timing is spot-on. There is language, and while there is perhaps not too vast an amount of it, overall, it certainly can be strong and pervasive when it's there. This also features images that could be disturbing to younger viewers, so really, in general, they maybe shouldn't be part of the audience for this one. A little of the humor is a bit... well, it goes a tad far. I recommend this to any fan of Hugh, Tom and Robin, and/or anyone else involved in making this, and/or if you enjoy one or two and can tolerate the others). 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, simple comedy. Grant and Moore have no chemistry yet Robin Willaims is EXCELLENT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hugh Grant is Samuel Faulkner. A simple man with a simple life with a loving girlfriend. Then the bombshell drops! His girlfriend, Rebecca Taylor (played by Julianne Moore) is pregnant! Samuel is not ready for this and it spins his life into disarray. The rest of the film (as hinted by the title) is the progression of Rebecca's pregnancy, and the slow comprehension by Sam of dawning fatherhood.Nine Months for the latter is dull with uninteresting dialogue and expected sequences. Though there are scenes which are so chaotic and suspenseful that you will cry laughing. Notably the few scenes with Robin Williams at his comedic best as the Russian doctor.The support cast is very good. Tom Arnold and Joan Cusack are well matched spouses. As well as Jeff Goldblum in a role that couldn't be more different from his Jurrasic Park character.Chris Columbus has made a light, enjoyable comedy, though you get the feeling that with each one of his passing films you can clearly see that it would have been handled better in the hands of basically any other director. Each one of Columbus's films (with the exceptions of Mrs Doubtfire and Home Alone) are simple and lifeless. They lack complex story lines, interesting problems and elements that make a film great.The main problem in this film is that Hugh Grant and Julianne Moore have no chemistry! They simply don't fit together! Unlike Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts in Notting Hill or Julianne Moore and Pierce Brosnan in The Laws of Attraction, the stars of this picture don't make a good team. Another negative note for Chris Columbus. Better casting next time! Nine Months is enjoyable comedy for fans of the stars and anyone who wants to have a quiet night indoors to indulge in a bit of light humor.</fullReview>

Tom Arnold plays Marty Dwyer, the awkward friend, and he too gives a very entertaining performance. Feff Goldblum is Sean Fletcher, Sam's close friend and brother in law to Jullianne Moore's character. There is a cute role for Robin Williams as the Russian born gynecologist who stumbles through the medical profession. It is now on DVD.

		<shortDescription>Sweet, Cute and Slightly Predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Nine Months" is a cute movie, but a tad bit predictable. Samuel (Hugh Grant)is a child psychiatrist whose beautiful longtime girlfriend Rebecca (Julianne Moore)announces her pregnancy. Samuel is soon in a panic because his perfect life is changing beyond his control. Not helping matters is his relationship with Marty (Tom Arnold), whose own wife Gail (Joan Cusack)is expecting another child. Marty is a constant pain in the butt that means well, but is a major annoyance to Samuel. His friend Sean (Jeff Goldblum)is of no help, either.You can pretty much see where the film ends up going: guy doesn't want to commit, girl gets upset and leaves, and guy gets a change of heart, realizing that he can't live without girl.When Rebecca goes into labor, a madcap dash through San Francisco ensues. Once at the hospital, they encounter more weirdness when Dr. Kosevich (Robin Williams)helps to deliver the baby. Problem is, his command of the English language (coupled with the fact that he never delivered a human baby) makes things even more crazy.Despite some predictability, "Nine Months," which is the American version of "Neuf Mois," the popular French film, is actually sweet and at some times touching (The scene when Samuel watches the tape of the ultrasound of his unborn child can bring a slight moisture to the eyes).Director Chris Columbus did a good job, though. The publicity surrounding Grant's Hollywood adventure didn't hurt either. Worth a look.</fullReview>

A MASTERY for hating kids !It could hardly have been written better as a kid-phobia film !NOTHING holds together. For example, Hugh Grant is supposedly a successful child psychiatrist, yet he doesn't appear to know the first thing about children in the storyline. Forgetting medical appointments is not a practised art in child psychiatry, neither. Neither can he control them, understand them, nor make a choice on whether he WANTS one !Bit-part Tom Arnold &amp; his wife were WAY too heavy on their parts, coming across as a "baby factory". If this is Americas position on raising children - as they were doing it - there is hope for a world where the natality rate is negative over there.Robin Williams alone, stood out as the only TRUE ACTOR in this film, for me.I notice that this is Chris Columbus first film as a producer - he can only improve from hereon in !

		<fullReview>This movie was great. It has all the right appeal. It was funny, sad when Hugh had to deal with a breakup of the relationship with the woman he loved. It shows true emotion. He also has to do a lot of growing up. I don't find two many of Hugh Grants movies that I don't like. But when you get this much hilarious comedy, with the love story with the happy ending. For a guy who didn't want a baby, he turns out to be a wonderful dad. The idiot doctor from Russia just can't be missed. Especially since he was the last doctor they wanted to see, but the only one on call. This is a movie that you will want to watch over, and over. I can't explain how much we loved this movie. A must have for your DVD collection. I would love to know how well It did at the box office. margiedice@cox.net</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I hate this movie and I am pretty sure I know why...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now for those of you who don't know me (which is most likely everyone who will ever read this...) I am not married, I don't have any kids nor do I have any plan on ever doing either of those two things. I am single, I got an good job, a nice apartment, I love my current way of life and while I do enjoy spending time with my nephews and nieces I feel like I would never be able to be an dad and if I ever somehow ended up as an father I know wouldn't be able to stand it (I enjoy my peace and quiet way too much).Now before we proceed, ask yourself this: Is there something wrong with that? Because if you ask this film, then apparently there is.While I watched this film with my sister (who is married and got three kids) I realized that we viewed it completely differently. She saw an predictable, goofy romcom movie about how an life changing event forced him to grow as an person and step up to take his place as an father.I saw an 103 minute film where a mans life was slowly torn asunder while the love of his life was more than willing to discard him just because he didn't do exactly as he wanted and because he didn't feel ready to become a father (do note, she NEVER gives him a say in the matter), all the while extremely unlikable supporting characters ridiculed him and the only other unmarried character (who was portrayed as an deadbeat who felt like his life was empty and hollow). Add to this the fact that the film portrays people who doesn't want to get married as immature, selfish and "commitment-phobes" then you start to see why I didn't enjoy the film at all.In short, not my kind of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>funny movie, extremely well cast !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie again after not seeing it in 14 years. It is still funny! The entire cast is great. Julianne Moore as Rebecca is sweet; Hugh Grant as Samuel is outwardly suave and together and then completely falls apart when he learns Rebecca is pregnant; Tom Arnold as their friend Marty practically steals the show and provides a load of additional laughs, particularly the toy store fight scene with "Arnie"; he and Joan Cusack as his wife Gail make a great pair, complete with bratty daughters that only make Samuel feel even more apprehensive about parenthood. Jeff Goldblum as Samuel's swinging artist friend Sean (and Marty's brother-in-law) is superb - I like the scene in which a panicked Samuel loses his temper on the tennis court and Sean says the John McEnroe imitations are alarming. Then there is Robin Williams as Dr. Kosevich the obstetrician, whose English is a bit shaky, as evidenced in the delivery room when he announces that he wants to give Rebecca an enema, then a pedicure, and then finally hits on the right word - epidural. Also unforgettable is the drive to the hospital when Rebecca goes into labor.All in all, a cute, mindless movie (as others have commented), but the laughs are great. I am surprised at how well this movie has held up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great for parents-to-be, yet not a complete "Chick Flick"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually most comedies regarding birth or marriage end up being complete "chick flicks". I don't want to come off as sexist, but let's face it: there are movies that captivate the average woman while _boring_ the average man, and vice versa (I remember the scene in "Sleepless In Seattle", where the women cry over "An Affair to Remember", and the men bond over "The Dirty Dozen", and neither group can understand the other).Becoming a mother is certainly a life-changing experience, but so is becoming a father. How do you address the subject of coming into fatherhood, without making it overly sappy? I think "Nine Months" does a very good job. It has its emotional moments, but it has some slapstick too, and in my opinion does a good job at not going too overboard with either, while maintaining a story.Hugh Grant plays a psychologist who's life seems to be going very well and financially secure, until he gets the news that his wife is pregnant. Tom Arnold and Jeff Goldbloom play rather secondary characters, but those characters help present the extreme sides of the "fatherhood" issue: Arnold plays a suburbia "superdad" with 4 or 5 daughters, and Goldbloom plays a somewhat wealthy (and older) childless bachelor. Robin Williams has a few comic relief scenes as the broken-english Doctor ("And now we will castrate the baby." "WHAT!?" "No, no...what's the word. CIRCUMSIZE!")I would strongly recommend this movie for parents about to have their first child. I would say "fathers", but it will most likely be the woman who picks this out of the video store. I'm a bachelor myself, but I watched this movie with my friend and his (then) pregnant wife. We all enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nobody's more believable than Joan Cusack, and Julianne Moore puts her part across too, though she does look distractingly like Xena the Warrior Princess. Hugh Grant has never done a better job at the usual Hugh Grant character, and Tom Arnold excels at the usual Tom Arnold character. The script is weak and predictable, so it's not surprising that someone wrote in the usual Robin Williams character and set up a San Francisco reckless-driving scene, but it's the acting squad that makes this one worth watching.One odd thing is that the scriptwriter seemed to feel called upon to explain who has money and who doesn't have money, then tripped over the issue anyway. Hugh Grant's character is immensely prosperous but can't buy a second auto without selling his Porsche. Hey Hugh, ever hear of used cars?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before they were "big stars", Hugh Grant and Julianne Moore made this sweet, occasionally funny but undistinguished romcom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Samuel (Hugh Grant) thinks he has the perfect life. A child psychologist with a lucrative practice, he also has a lovely, dance teaching, live-in girlfriend, Rebecca (Julianne Moore), and a upscale apartment in a trendy neighborhood in San Fran. For their five year anniversary, Samuel treats Rebecca to a gourmet picnic on the beach, where he waxes lyrical about how great their life is. Yet, a day or two later, on a trip to a friend's (Jeff Goldblum) mansion outside the city, Rebecca drops the bombshell that she is pregnant. Samuel promptly wrecks the car! Not at all happy, the kid shrink listens as Rebecca tells him she is having the baby, with or without his support. Mustering some decency, Samuel arranges to go with Rebecca for her first doctor's appointment, where Beck's regular doctor has been called away and they are stuck with a Russian-born, new-in-town, very eccentric physician (Robin Williams). Also creating havoc for the couple are a baby-making married twosome (Joan Cusack and Tom Arnold) who try to convince their new friends that their joy will be unmeasured upon the arrival of their child. But, can Dr. Samuel really make an abrupt about-face on his former "perfect" life without diapers? This is a sweet and sometimes funny comedy that succeeds mostly on the shoulders of the fine, fine cast. Grant is a very infectious performer, even when he is given a tame, somewhat lame script to follow and the beautiful Moore shows off her comic side in this film, also. The supporting cast is a dream, with Cusack, Goldblum, Williams, and especially Arnold making the most of their roles, too. Naturally, the scenery of San Francisco and the surrounding area is lovely and the costumes and production values are just right as well. Yet, the script, based on a French film, and the direction are the problems, alternating between fairly good humor and tepid, rehashed contrivances. If you love the stars or are a big romantic comedy fan, then, yes, this film is worthwhile. But, after a viewing, you will probably make no plans for a second showing, at least not for another nine months or more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An fairly entertaining romantic comedy with some big laughs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Child Pyschologist Sam (Hugh Grant) has it all, an beautiful girlfriend (Julianne Moore), an great red Porsche and he's living the good life. Until his girlfriend tell him that she's pregnant. Which he's extremely surprised and shocked at the same time. While he's taking bad advice from a failed artist (Jeff Goldblum) and he simply can't handle the pressure, he's getting. Now he and his girlfriend have nine months to prepare for being first-time parents. They meet overbearing married couple (Tom Arnold &amp; Joan Cusack), who have three daughters (Ashley Johnson, Alexa Vega &amp; Aislin Roche) of their own and including an new baby on the way. Which his girlfriend learns some parenting from the couple, they meet. They also meet an strange whacked out of his mind Russain Obstetrician (Oscar-Winner:Robin Williams), who might deliver their first child. But Sam can't take it anymore and he has to make an decision for what's best for him, his girlfriend and their unborn child.Directed by Chris Columbis (Bicentennial Man, Mrs. Doubtfire, Rent) made an entertaining comedy that is quite silly, forced and over the top at times. But the cast makes this pleasant film lively and enjoyable. But the story is really about one man... who has to face responsibility, change his ways and getting matured as well. This film receive some controversial before it came out. Because of Grant's one night with a prostitute in his car. Which i think, it made this comedy even more popular with the ever growing popularity of Grant's female fans.DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an fine Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD's only extras are the original theatrical trailer and TV spots. This comedy manages to have some touching moments and some big laughs, especially the scene where it involves Grant and Arnold in a department kids stone. But it's Oscar-Winner:Williams, who has the biggest laughs in the film and he steals the shows in his few scenes. This was a box office hit, when it was released back in 1995. Sure, this movie isn't classic but it's certainly funnier than you might expect. This is a remake of the 1994 French Film "Neuf Mois". Actor:Christopher Lambert, who produced the original 1994 movie. Lambert is also one of the executive producers of the American remake. Columbis wrote the screenplay for this picture. Based on a screenplay by Patrick Braoudé and Daniel Russo. Look fast for Kristen Davis. Panavision. (*** ?/*****).</fullReview>

The supporting cast of Joan Cusack, Tom Arnold and Robin Williams are perfect. Tom Arnold is definitely at his best. A great scene is when Grant and Arnold beat up Arnie the Dinosaur in a toy-store. You should watch the movie if only for this scene. Despite what some people say Chris Columbus did a great job of bringing this film to life. There are plenty of other funny scenes that you will not soon forget.This is a great movie for people getting ready to have their first child.

		<fullReview>Nine Months is a movie that is mindless fun. It doesn't take itself too seriously and hopes you don't either. This is not exactly a movie to debate with people or invokes deep feelings. It's meant to entertain you for two hours, and I think it succeeds just fine. Hugh Grant doesn't show much of a range (but when you are Hugh Grant, that works wonders for your appeal). Julianne Moore plays Grant's cute and patient girlfriend longing for commitment. This movie is all about Grant's growth into embracing the commitment (with the catalyst of the impending baby). This movie is heavy on physical comedy (which, I admit, I am a sucker for) and just makes me smile. What can I say? It's no Oscar winner, but, if you need a laugh, rent it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film with some laugh out loud moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically Sam(Hugh Grant) and Rebecca(Julianne Moore) are living together and seem to have this perfect life. Suddenly Rebecca tells Sam that they are going to have a baby. He's very unwilling to accept this as it means he'll have to give up on a few things such as his beloved car, as it only fits two people. Rebecca dumps him after a while due to his lack of enthusiasm but then he eventually wins her back. They get married and she has the baby. I think other IMDb members are far too critical about this film. Of course its nit going to win any Oscars but it is a funny rom-com. Its not trying to be this great dramatic film. There was a few really funny moments. I laughed so much when they had the fight with the dinosaur and when Sam kept crashing into people when he was trying to get Rebecca to the hospital. I think Hugh Grant is a very good actor and he did a relatively good job in this film. I also think Robin Williams was so funny as the doctor. I think the Dwyer family added a lot of humour to the film.But there were some bad moments in the film. The scene where Rebecca and Gail had their babies was completely over the top and something you would expect in a kids show, but yet i still found it funny. Also did Sam get rid of the cat? He should have because that would have meant he was really prepared to give up some of his life for the baby (because the doctor said the cat could be unhygienic to have around when the baby was born. Sam didn't want to give the cat away because he had it for many years) Also i didn't feel like there was any chemistry between Sam and Rebecca However I still enjoyed the film and i would recommend it if you want a light hearted, funny film to relax to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh gee, I didn't say nothing mister, you must be hearing things. Bye bye, Arnie loves you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I ask you again. Where has this style of comedy gone? I applaud director Chris Columbus for keeping the spirit behind this film alive for so long, but when everyone else goes the way of sexual humor and bathroom jokes, there is only so much you can do. I miss this type of comedy. This film used to be on my top Ten List back in 1995. I used to watch it over and over again, never getting enough of Robin Williams and Tom Arnold (is that blasphemy now?). They were comic geniuses at the peak of their careers. Everything just seemed to fit into place with this film. The story was unique and personable, the humor was a cut above and the characters ? well ? the characters were ? decent. As I watch this film now, older, wiser and chalk full of more films, I think that is my only gripe about the film was the characters. There were some that worked perfectly. Goldblum can do wrong, Williams is a stitch (doctor humor), and Arnold seemed to carry his own weight (ok, I honestly will stop now). The only two I had trouble with were Hugh Grant and Julianne Moore. All right, I will give Grant the credit that this was one of his first big Hollywood films, but he just couldn't seem to hit his cues as well. When I was younger, I didn't notice it as much as I did this time around. He was trying to do Python when he should have just been himself. Not to worry Grant fans, he gets better with age (minus Edge of Reason). What was Julianne Moore doing in this movie? I don't know how I missed it before, but she really doesn't act in this movie. Her face gives some expressions, but her body does nothing but stand there. It was really obvious this viewing than it was nearly 10 years ago. Looking back, it wasn't one of her early films, so maybe she just wasn't comfortable. I remember when she tried humor in Laws of Attraction, she was really out of her element there. Perhaps it just isn't her genre. Thankfully, Williams, Goldblum, and Arnold round out the cast that conveniently anchor this film to the ground.Do you know what I loved most about this film? The physical comedy. The fallings, the fake fights, and the awkward hits all seemed to fit very well in this film. The timing was exact and the laughs could still be heard from our living room. While I think in another ten years this film will be hard to watch, it was good to see it one last time before it died. It isn't a landmark 90s comedy, but what it does it does very well. Columbus was King of this genre, with other hits like Adventures in Babysitting and Home Alone, he redefined and built his name upon comedy. Whenever I think of films from the early 90s that stand out, I have no doubt that Columbus has his hand somewhere in it. His work behind the camera in Nine Months is no exception. He seems to be a step ahead of the actors, always knowing where the camera should go and be placed so that he can capture the exact feeling of the actors. He is a genuine craftsman that could build a simple task and make it into a blockbuster. Overall, I was still impressed with this film. While it didn't quite carry the same punch as it did when I watched it in 1995, it did make want to revisit some of Robin Williams' older films and laugh like I did when I was young. This is a genre that redefined an entire generation. This is my golden years of Hollywood, and it is good to see that years later, pulled from a Video Store vault, that it still has some of its momentum remaining. I cannot ask anything more than for you to check this film out when you have the chance. If anything for Robin Williams performance, but I have this deep feeling that you will enjoy even more.Grade: *** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vehicle for "Bad Boy" Hugh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitive vehicle for Hollywood's new 'bad boy' Hugh Grant - whose philandering exploits with "Miss Divine" could possibly have been a publicity stunt, considering the amount of popularity it has gained him - is full of clichéd situations and caricatures, some effective and others misplaced.Chris Columbus ("Home Alone", "Mrs. Doubtfire" - both funnier) has written and directed this somewhat soppy, occasionally funny tale of the terrors of pending parenthood. Grant is faced with a dilemma when his 'dangerously close to perfection' life is threatened after his long term g.f. falls pregnant. This unexpected development forces him to come to grips with what he wants in life, the responsibilities of fatherhood or the freedom of bachelorhood. Several times Columbus' pic attempts to become philosophical, with varied effect. Comedy is more successful, though it too swings from hilarity to humourless.Grant and Moore are both likable and suitable as the 90's couple faced with this modern day problem. Jeff Goldblum is stuck with another limited support role, while Joan Cusack and Tom Arnold are forced to play a grating couple whose antics with their three obnoxious daughters are much more annoying than funny - one only wishes someone would spray them with something.Big problem with "9 Months" is the way certain themes - both comic and dramatic - are over killed terribly, but subtlety is not a Columbus forte. In "Home Alone" he didn't require it, "9 Months" however could certainly use some.Robin Williams turns in another hilariously manic performance as a Russian gynaecologist whose chronic nervousness and poor grasp of the English language land him in much hot water.Sunday, October 29, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its slow but it's not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It always remains interesting to me when you see a movie you like by a director then the next year or two comes and you look forward to their next movie you are slightly disappointed. In this case the director of "Nine Months" is Chris Columbus and before he made this movie the movie I enjoyed that he directed was "Mrs. Doubtfire". Since I enjoyed that one I thought I better take a look at Columbus's next movie. But this does not have the same level of laughs and originality that made "Mrs. Doubtfire" fun. The other particular things I found annoying in this was Tom Arnold's character. I am sorry if you disagree with me but with the exception of a few movies I think Tom Arnold is annoying and he had the perfect chance here to show the audience how annoying he really is. I will give it a bit of a compliment I did enjoy Robin Williams in this movie. When it had its slow parts he made them slightly more alive. "Nine Months" is too slow and some scenes are appallingly unfunny but it is not a bad movie. I would probably rank it as average if anything else. I think it would have been more funny if it had been more original. We see these types of events happening frequently in our movies. If you want to watch a better piece by the director and star of this movie, definitely go for "Mrs. Doubtfire". But if you have nothing better to do it may be worth a trip to the video store.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Being a good actress has its drawbacks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has spoilers of the ?discussing the plot- type.* Watching this as an Ashley pic, it took more than one viewing for this DVD to feel essential for me.The story is about a couple, unmarried and symbolically On The Beach. She is dropping big hints of a hunger for them to get married and he is considering this as an abstract proposition. He does not like the idea of rocking the boat, spoiling a relationship that is his idea of perfect. Him not noticing the nuance re the marriage question, he is on the beach and facing the wrong way without even realising it.Their communication skills are shown to be lacking. He works in mental health, a child psychotherapist, and she is a teacher of dance. It could be proper to muse re the nature of vocations, instead I muse re ET Drew.Then they are bumped into by a family that they know, acquaintances of a friend. These are real disaster, especially for the first half of the story, in the second half they show that they have positive attributes hidden in their beings too. My problem comes from Ashley playing their oldest, her being a good actress becomes a problem, it becomes less obvious that she is a good actress. As in Annie she is shown from a ten year old's perspective, full size, not as a small girl. Her two sisters are shown as very small.Water issues. Water into wine is a strong thread. It appears on the soundtrack, via the record player and Van The Man, straight after the beach and again at the very end. I go askew with this as I am just getting to know Ashley's first feature, written by and starring Van Damme, pronounced Dam or Damn.Water issues. Sam - Hugh has a massive disorder at the level of him being a danger to self and others. This partly relates to communication style, good eye contact when driving not centred on the driving. This is a story where everyone has a sprinkling of disorders, he is not the only one to be a menace.* The couple end up married and with a boy.Towards the end he apologises for his earlier diseased attitude and I cannot see why. Disease was in everyone, in this case his apology feels lap dog like, pets need to be other than that. Really, he plays a man just being a man, more effective than many. He ends up with a boy that he might easily be a very fit parent for. A boy growing in the family of Sam - Hugh must have a better chance of survival as a person, despite Sam being askew.The other family would have massive troubles if they had a boy, their dad is much more askew than his wife and it is interesting trying to puzzle out the root pressures that could lead him to that condition. I have to try to attempt to consider that as Ashley can be read as influenced by her dad, a car dealer, possibly heading to walk in his footsteps. Her being a good actress is a problem for me.amended at Sept 2007: As a male to female I often have trouble with the water holes available to girls. Looking to what is available in England for boys, by way of magazines, I have no idea how they manage to survive. That is England, I do not know about other countries. It is natural for me to assume that, like me and Donnie D, but to a lesser extent, they would be at risk of being torn to pieces between fear and love and loyalties, etc, no tangible helps visible. Male as something strange, yet male is often said to be distinctive from a woman's view and not all are Donald Duck. * This Ashley fan, from Annie and What Women Want, does get frightened by this story. Damme that this is directed and screen-scripted by the magnificent Chris Columbus, who shows a real skill with horror.Shannon - Ashley is someone at a problem age. Weasels and trouble and waters, a different view. Acclimatise to this story, I find that she makes a beautiful bridesmaid.These are the days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You cannot mention this movie without recalling the appearance of Hugh Grant on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. His promotional tour was interrupted by Divine intervention. It is unfortunate that this incident occurred as he was being introduced to American audiences in a big way in a Chris Cloumbus (Rent, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Home Alone)picture. But, events that happened outside the movie makes some of the dialog in the movie even more funny; though not intentionally.The film has plenty of supporting characters (Julianne Moore, Tom Arnold,Joan Cusack,Jeff Goldblum, Robin Williams) to make it funny without the humor of Grant, but he is the star of this funny movie. He is raucously funny and shows that he is a major Hollywood star. He is especially great with Robin Williams, who plays a minor role as a Russian obstetrician. The only thing that could be a flaw in the film is that it starts slow and doesn't really get going until he sees the sonogram.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams steals the show!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams only has one scene in this film, but it has become my favourite scene in the whole movie. Robin is one of my favourite actors and his role here as the crazy Russian Dr Kosevich is hilarious. The story goes that the eccentric gynaecologist has mainly worked on rats and monkeys, and only recently moved up to humans. The confusion which ensues in the consultation room, as he tries to cope with the new computer and a high-tech examination table, will surely have you laughing out loud.Trivia: Nine Months is a US remake of the French movie Neuf mois.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Samuel Faulkner is About to Become the One Thing in Life He Never Expected to Be-- A Father.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Meet Samuel Faulkner, a child psychologist in San Fransisco. He's got it all: a beautiful girlfriend Rebecca and a shiny red Porsche. What more could Sam ask for? Little did Sam know his life was about to make a big significant change. It all began one day as he and Rebecca were on a picnic at the beach to celebrate their 5 year anniversary. They were not married, however. Suddenly, a kite flies down and hits Sam. The kite's owner, Marty Dwyer, car salesman races over along with his wife Gail and their three daughters. Sam was just fine. He and Rebecca stay with Sam's bachelor friend Sean for the weekend, however Sean's brother in-law, Marty Dwyer, and his family showed up uninvited. He announced that Gail was pregnant again; Sam and Rebecca went for a drive in the country one afternoon and Rebecca tells him she's pregnant. That shocks Sam so much they have a head-on collision. Thank goodness the Porsche didn't really suffer much damage. Sam and Rebecca have mixed feelings about having a baby, but soon they decide to just bare with it and hope for the best. They go to see Rebecca's gynecologist, Dr. Green, but he was on sick leave so his replacement, Dr. Kosevich, a rat and monkey doctor from Russia who is now licensed to deliver human babies, saw them instead. Dr. Kosevich proved to be a real screwball. When he found out they had a cat, he said it had to go. Sam and Rebecca meet Marty and Gail at the hospital. They tell Sam he must get a bigger car. Sam, afraid of change, doesn't seem to like the idea of them having a baby and Rebecca considers leaving him. They accompany Marty and Gail to the toy store to buy toys for their babies. The funniest scene in the whole movie is where Sam and Marty run afoul of Arnie, the big green dinosaur. Some months later, Sam and Sean play tennis together and Sam suddenly realized that was the day of the second ultrasound! He had missed it! Rebecca moved out of their apartment and went to stay with Gail and Marty. It was over between she and Sam. Sam was a broken man. He found bachelor life with Sean to be somewhat boring, so he decided to clean up his act and grow up. The first thing he did was trade in his Porsche for a family-sized SUV. It took alot of convincing, but he finally got Rebecca back and they got married and moved into a bigger place and go out to dinner one night. Rebecca's water broke so they rush to the hospital. Sam was so worried he wasn't looking where he was going and nearly hit an elderly couple. The man suddenly had chest pains so they join Sam and Rebecca. Sam struggles to call the doctor, but is again not watching the road and he plows down a bicycle rider and breaks his leg. They take him to the hospital as well. When they arrive, they look in horror at who would be delivering the baby: Dr. Kosevich. The hospital was full that night so Gail and Rebecca had to share a room. The babies are soon born! Marty's is a girl and Sam's is a boy! Sam, Rebecca and their new son all live happily ever after. A very good movie. Very funny! The funniest part is when Marty and Sam run afoul of Arnie. Hilarious! Hugh Grant was good, so was Julianne Moore. Tom Arnold and Joan Cusack were good too, so was Jeff Goldblum and Robin Williams was magnificent as usual! The movie was directed by Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire and Home Alone). Speaking of Home Alone, in the scene where Sam and the gang are driving to the hospital, they pass a movie theater that's playing Home Alone VII. How about that? Anyway, I recommend Nine Months! Laugh out loud funny!-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great romantic comedy with some slapstick too!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start by saying that Robin Williams' russian accent isn't convincing, but that's not enough to destroy a movie...The movie is funny and well acted. It gets a little silly sometimes, but not in a bad way. A little like a loony toons cartoon...(No, characters are NOT falling from cliffs and getting squashed)The cast is wonderful and the jokes and slapstick are hilarious, especially the ride-to-the-hospital climax.Watching this movie is a very nice and light way to pass an evening at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very funny, tasteful, enjoyable and well made comedy (although the end is far too cheesy). Tom Arnold is definitely at his best. My favorite scene is when Grant and Arnold beat up Arnie the Dinosaur (you get the hint) in a toy-store. You have to watch the movie if only for this episode.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you value family, and keep an open mind, it's very fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My guess is that 90% of the bad reviews on this site are from people that either: 1. Don't like Hugh Grant 2. Don't like the traditional view of family 3. Don't understand films where men see eye-to-eye with women and respect them, which are branded "chick flicks" 4. Are so jaded by the negative and nasty comedies shown over the last decade that they can't appreciate humor that is tactful and positive No, this is not a film that deserved an Oscar, but it has an excellent message and a string of hilarious scenes that are laugh-out-loud funny.Just give it a try and keep an open mind - and heart. This film is a gem that can capture your heart if you give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I absolutely loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe so many people gave this movie such a low rating! Oh, well, I guess everyone likes and dislikes different things. But I thought it was probably one of the best movies I've ever seen! The acting was great, the direction was great, and the movie was just overall great! I loved the "Arnie the Dinosaur" part! And I thought it was a great idea to put all the stars' baby pictures at the end. I laughed so hard, and loved it so much, that I rewound and watched it at least 5 times! I totally recommend this movie. You just have to see for yourself if you like it or not, but I know I sure did! I'd have to give it a 9.5/10 rating. If I were you, I'd at least rent this movie- give it a chance. Don't always trust the reviewers on TV (since, I mean, they say everything is bad). I bet you that at least 7 out of 10 people who read this, have never seen the movie, and go out and rent it will love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie plays a couple who are expecting their 1st child. In this movie they have their ups and downs in their relationship before having this baby. It's very funny &amp; is recomended to all who is thinking about renting or buying this movie. My favorite part is at the end when Hugh Grant along with his partner (I forgot his character's name) picks up the baby who is crying in the middle of the night &amp; dances slowly to the music. Plus, I love Hugh Grant in all of his movies I have watched. He's so good-looking &amp; I love his accent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sarandon Effect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I believe there are three strong film actresses today that can do `folded' acting: acting which conveys both the character and some annotation on the character. Moore is one of them. I first realized this in her `Vanya.' And so did many in the industry, with the result that the following year she was in many films. Some were a real challenge, and it seems that she accepted the others with the understanding that they would be simple walks. This is a walk.It is by the successful Columbus, who has made few films but all of them are based on situations driving characters. And those situations always involve kids. Until recently, Columbus had no intelligent or even interesting element of any kind in his projects. The `Chamber of Secrets' was so financially important, he was forced to accommodate an architectural eye and cinematographer.Why do I mention this? Because an actress of Moore's caliber needs something to hook into, and the nature of the project was to avoid such things at all cost. What to do?Watch. Julianne acts as Susan Sarandon acting the part. Watch how she eliminates all acting with her body at all (except for the general portrayal of the pregnant posture). Watch how she acts almost exclusively with the sides of her mouth and her eyebrows. Watch as she adopts an accommodating but distant sexiness. Watch as the shape of her face is changed by clever hairstyling. All of this to emulate Susan, and in particular Susan's Louise as if she were doing `Blue Velvet' but for the other side.Stay with me a minute. `Blue Velvet' took the intelligent acting community by storm. It was a film where the `characters' were two film genres, one of them the happy vehicle that Columbus does. The characters move through these two worlds, so that their context shifts and is never secure. Actors like Moore study this stuff. See how she shaped her movements of the dancing teacher around Rosselini's child dancing teacher of the previous year in `Fearless' which dealt with the same material?What she's doing is a little bit of subversion: Louise against the machine.Artists like this are always doing something, even when they are at rest - even when the vehicle is as trivial as `Smoochy.'Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugh Grant, Julianne Moore, Robin Williams, Tom Arnold make this a very funny film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grant plays the prototypical single guy, well-off, independent, with a beautiful live-in girlfriend, played by Moore. Although she is on birth control ("They should put 3% failure rate on the package!") she becomes pregnant, and Grant doesn't react well. She moves out eventually, determined to raise the child by herself rather than stay with an uncommittted man. But Grant eventually figures it out, and they get back together.There are lots of funny moments, but I laughed loudest during the penultimate scene, during delivery by the two friends, Moore and Joan Cusack. Robin Williams as the Russian doctor is hilarious, as are Grant and Arnold. This film is not high art, the story is simple and trite, but it is fun entertainment, much better than the IMDb rating would indicate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My real life "9 Months" horror story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am suffering through a real life NINE MONTHS. I am the male in the equation. My wife is traditional and nurturing -- which are attractive feminine features -- but she is 100% against abortion, even if rape. An unplanned pregnancy took place. We both preferred a female. The ultrasound indicates a male.Anyway, the 9 months of horror is only 1/2 over now. The physical changes in body shape are not so bad yet. But already in 5 months her long slender youthful neck has disappeared. She now only has a bloated head on top of her body.The changes in energy are most unpleasant. She has become a sleepy, slouching, slumping, yawning low energy mass of flesh always drooping on me. Being close and clinging is kind of flattering, but with pregnancy it has become an endless series of face-to-face yawns and burps. She yawns during every waking moment when she is not belching -- right in my face.Think of any fun activity one might look forward to... now picture that you must do it with a partner who is going to yawn, yawn, and yawn again before doing this activity, during the activity, and after the activity. Even walking outdoors in fresh air at 12 noon -- YAWN. Then more sleep.Beltching and burping, do you want to talk about endless belching and burping? She looks like and sounds like a beer drinker after a 6-pack. Today I asked her to try not to repeatedly burp into my face. That went over real big.I cannot stay still at home. If I sit on the john, she is on my lap slouching. When I eat, she is burping over my plate.Life has become a living nightmare. The bipolar mood swings never end. The emotional changes mean hour-by-hour, minute-by-minute, walking on egg shells. Crying over spilled milk is a real thing. And don't forget... YAWN... BURP! BURP! BURP!...I am demanded to go out for foods that do not exist. She is from a small foreign island and her foods are not available here. She now has aversion to her own cooking. She will no longer cook. For that matter, she has stopped doing any chores and she has always been a stay at home housewife."Dear YAWWWWWN, come home after working 55 hours each week and take care of the house while I sleep -- YAWWWN, BURP!"Soon we will have either a Cesarean scar to look forward to, or if we are really lucky, there will be natural childbirth and tearing and damage to her female areas. Yes, it will be adult diaper time and we will be at the incontinence support group at the hospital. And of course her sexy body will be forever stretched out of shape. Oh, joy!According to Desmond Morris who wrote THE NAKED APE, healthy is attractive, unhealthy is unattractive. Pregnancy is not attractive. Your partner becomes always tired in an unhealthy sort of way. It is a real life nightmare. Adoption, think adoption.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The message makes the average viewer uncomfortable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is somewhat disturbing that a movie which entertains and delivers a moral message is looked on as "unimportant". But, the average viewer looks at movies to confirm their lack of ability to have character and strength. This movie comes too close to the reality that family and responsibility are the right path, and that makes most viewers uncomfortable.It's also too bad that Mr. Grants lack of moral judgment happened in parallel to the movies release, which didn't exactly help it deliver the right message. It then came off as hypocritical.That said, this is one of my most favorite movies of all time, despite what viewers think.</fullReview>
