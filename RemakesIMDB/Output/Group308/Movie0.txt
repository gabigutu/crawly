		<shortDescription>No Reservations About "No Reservations"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"No Reservations" is not a great film, nor does it pretend to be. It is very predictable and follows the formula used in countless other movies. Despite that, it give you everything you want from this type of film and is better than many of the sequels that have come out this year.Catherine Zeta Jones is as beautiful as ever. There is a nice dose of Verdi and Puccini opera arias, and Abigail Breslin steals the film like she did with "Little Miss Sunshine." I have not liked Aaron Eckert in the past, but in this film he brings happiness to the otherwise dour Zeta Jones.Some of the professional critics said they like the original German film "Mostly Martha" better, but I thought that "No reservations" improved on the original in every possible way. The only valid criticism I could find was that Catherine Zeta Jones is too beautiful to be believable as a lonely chef. That is a flaw I can live with.If you are looking for a break from the so-called Summer "action" films, "No Reservations" is not very original, but it certainly fits the bill. The only drawback is that you will definitely leave the theater feeling really hungry for good food.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the German film (Mostly Martha) that is the basis of this remake, and I was worried that the transition to Hollywood would spoil all the things that made the original so delightful. But I was very pleasantly surprised. There is a substantial plot change, but it doesn't wreck the movie, and a lot of the original dialog is kept word-for-word. Even if you know nothing about the original film, this is a lovely romantic comedy. During the sold-out preview show that I attended, people were laughing at the right moments and feeling moved at the right times too, and the casting was spot on - Catherine Zeta-Jones is perfect as the work-obsessed Kate dealing with the disruption of her perfectly-ordered life and Aaron Eckhart is irresistible with his mop of hair and those dimples. And what can you say about Abigail Breslin except that she's the most natural child actor working today. If you like romantic comedies, you'll like this one - it's smart, charming and you're rooting for the couple from the minute they meet. I can recommend this without reservations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Great Cinematography in This Family Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike the trailers imply for this movie, "No Reservations" is more a family drama rather than a romantic comedy. There is lavish bitter dark pathos of death in the beginning of the movie and the more colorful look at restaurant cooking while there are bits of humor scattered like sweets throughout the movie. There are some amazing close up scenes that really grab the attention of the audience with the emotions and captivating context of the scenes, the color motif is brilliant. Overall, the script is basic and mostly predictable with some good tie-ins and closures. It's Catherine Zeta Jones that really makes this movie deliciously sparkle. Entertaining and fun for the summer with good flashes of cooking on part with "Ratatouille" that came out just a little earlier. As an aside, Patricia Clarkson had an earlier role in another cooking film, a romantic, comedy fantasy entitled "Simply Irresistible" (1999) with Sarah Michlle Geller in a more gracious supporting role. Seven out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go and see the original "Bella Martha"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Go to the video store and get the original. I do not understand why Hollywood has that need to take a perfect foreign movie and remake it. "Mostly Martha" or "Bella Martha" has a much better cast. Beginning with the heroine Martina Gedeck, who convinced me much more in the role of the work-obsessed perfectionist than the more famous Catherine Zeta Jones, to the Italian cook and the niece suddenly deprived of her mother and forced to live with an aunt, not fit for child-rearing. In many ways, the American version of the movie is a copy of the German original. They just exchanged the actors. However, they also changed the story because it would have been difficult and not very believable to materialize a father for the little girl in an American context. I was thinking about that. Maybe the father could have been Puerto Rican, or Cuban, or Mexican. Well, there are so many "guest workers" in the U.S. Take your pick. But I doubt that any of them would have shown up to shoulder the responsibility as the Italian father did in the original. Therefore, the American movie leaves that part out but keeps the Italian cook. And by doing this the whole story changes. In the original "Martha" is so removed from reality that she thinks it is okay to send her niece off with a complete stranger in a foreign country. The American "Martha" is softer and therefore the movie is sweeter and does not have that edge the German movie has. In the original the "Italian" cook is not so good looking but much more charming , the little girl is more of a brat but much more believable and "Martha" is more representative of a career woman in today's world than the watered down version we are presented in the American version. And the whole opera music in the American version was very annoying. I loved the Italian songs in the original and bought the CD. Hollywood recognized that "Mostly Martha" was a great movie. Maybe the distribution companies should have put it in more theaters or it should have been shown in English without subtitles. In any case, the original is so much better. By the way this reminds me of another remake. "Shall we dance" is one of my favorites in the original Japanese version and totally forgettable in the American version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had a chance but.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had all the potential and makings of a great feel good, great love story...the cast is perfect, the visuals work, the original premise works, the characters work....but the story moves from one chess move to the next in a most predictable way...not one character in the movie has any depth or has any depth explained by the director. All we know about Catherine Zeta-Jones character is she is obsessed with her world....nobody is allowed in and nobody challenges her world...that much is obvious....but the remaining characters all have their own dimensions that are really never explored or exposed....Aaron Eckhart's character had so much more to offer to the story but wasn't allowed, Abigail Breslin's character is so easy to understand that her performance comes across somewhat predictable and phony....in the end everything reverts back to the forced turbulent world of Catherine Zeta-Jones which the audience never totally falls for....honestly, her turbulent world is not much more than a portrayal of a selfish, self obsessed, spoiled lady who most people would not have much time or sympathy for in the real world. The director needed to make her a hero and never does....in the end, it is Eckhart's character that ultimately wins because he wins.Not a lousy movie, just a movie that could have been a lot better with more depth of personalities allowed in, explained and exposed.Cheers</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, i must admit, when i saw the trailer for this movie, i was looking forward to it. I am generally a fan of light hearted romantic comedies and from the trailer, thats the impression i got of this movie. However, i spent most of the movie waiting for the comedy to begin. Although there were a couple of amusing scenes, in general the outlook of the movie was quite depressing.I also found it difficult to fall in love with any of the characters as they all seemed a little underdeveloped, the time which the director could have used exploring the characters taken up by a needless overuse of Opera, making the movie feel dragged out and slow.All in all, although there are some touching scenes, the trailer is quite deceptive and i would only suggest you go watch this if there is really nothing else that tickles your fancy.Not fantastic, and as i have said before; Bland.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lugubrious Hybrid of the Food Network and Lifetime Makes for an Attractive But Bland Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite what I recall of the advertising campaign last year, this soft-hearted 2007 film is far less a Food Network-derived romantic comedy than a Lifetime-oriented drama about grief and work/life balance. Directed by Scott Hicks ("Shine") and written by first-timer Carol Fuchs, this film offers the most insightful peek into the workings of an upscale Manhattan restaurant since 2000's "Dinner Rush" (i.e., if you don't count last year's CGI-generated, French food-fest, "Ratatouille"), but it also seems intent in splintering the story between the romantic sparks between the co-stars and the unexpected relationship that a single aunt forms with her orphaned niece. The result is heartwarming but rather diluted considering the potential inherent in the material presented. Hicks and Fuchs also seem intent on inserting predictable clichés along the way to reinforce the formulaic approach taken with the story.Basically a remake of the 2001 German comedy, "Mostly Martha", the plot centers on perfectionist chef Kate who runs a tightly efficient kitchen in a chic SoHo bistro. As a resolute overachiever, she is able to get up before dawn to get to the fish market and stay late at the restaurant making her impeccably presented dishes until closing. So tightly wound is Kate that restaurant owner Paula forces her to see a therapist to address her supposedly difficult personality. This is the first of several disconnects I had with the film as Kate strikes me as demanding but not particularly abusive to her staff. Regardless, her life is turned upside down by the sudden death of her sister and the addition of her niece Zoe to her structured life. As if that wasn't enough, Paula has hired Nick, a rowdy opera-loving sous-chef, to partner with Kate as she struggles with her personal transition at home. Taking a number from the Tracy-Hepburn manual for romantic comedy, tempers flare as do sparks. Zoe's recovery from her mother's death becomes a complicating factor, but the rest of the story plays out basically how you would presume.More interesting in edgier, less sympathetic roles, Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the icier aspects of her role well, but she is markedly less arresting when her character turns warm and gooey. The script also doesn't really respect her character much since she is made to look overly foolish and insensitive in her early scenes as a struggling mother figure. Aaron Eckhart seems to be playing more of a plot device as Nick, but he does it well, and the requisite sparks occur with Zeta-Jones. Cornering the market on playing put-upon children, Abigail Breslin is fine as Zoe, even though she has to be glumly depressed for much of the film. The usually more dimensional Patricia Clarkson plays Paula as a surprisingly brittle, opportunistic character, while Bob Balaban isn't given much to do at all as Kate's therapist but act as a bromide. Stuart Dryburgh's autumnal cinematography makes all the food look good, the stars as well, and minimalist composer Philip Glass, of all people, provided the unobtrusive soundtrack dominated by Puccini, Verdi, and Flotow arias. The most significant bonus item on the 2008 DVD is a twenty-minute episode of the Food Network's "Unwrapped" which includes interviews with the film's stars and the real chefs who concocted the dishes in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very likable even for a formula romcom, mainly because of the terrific casting and performances of the actors.The forever beautiful and talented Catherine Zeta-Jones (Chicago, The Mask of Zorro) is spot on as Kate, a workaholic chef at hoity toity 22 Bleeker. Kate unexpectedly inherits her niece Zoe, played tremendously well by Abigail Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine). Real-life motherhood must have enabled Zeta-Jones to show her softer side with the restraint her character called for.Aaron Eckhart (Thank You for Smoking, Black Dahlia) is Nick, the Italian-trained, opera-singing, charismatic new chef who invades Kate's precision-perfect French kitchen. Nick is Kate's quintessential opposite and eventually helps her sort out her trust issues and even enhances her parenting skills.It is refreshing to see CZJ back on the silver screen where she belongs, and playing a non-glamorous character for once, even sans makeup in some scenes. At 38 years old, that is a brave feat indeed (and this courage is consistent with all the flawed characters she likes to play).Her on screen chemistry with Eckhart is positively sizzling, and his cockiness to her coolness effectively makes you forget about the trite plot. While Zeta-Jones has also been criticized for being too beautiful for the role of a lonely chef, that is actually one of the ironies of life that this movie uncovers: beauty and talent doesn't really guarantee bliss.Despite the awful MTV-like montage of the trio grocery shopping and the rest of the unspectacular elements, overall, the movie makes you feel for the characters. You leave the cinema all warm and fuzzy, and that makes the execution of No Reservations a success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't touch the original (Mostly Martha)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hesitated seeing this movie, having really enjoyed the original, 'Mostly Martha'. What a disappointment. Catherine Zeta Jones is a good actress but this wasn't her film. The original had poignant moments, perfectly punctuated with an incredible soundtrack. No reservations felt like it never connected. The food, the characters - nothing felt passionate. In Mostly Martha, the food came alive- every scene was filmed in such a way you could taste it with your eyes - the smells, the textures. The food in 'No Reservations' was in the background - rarely did we get a closeup of the preparation; the characters were not real enough to carry the movie without it. It was hard finishing the movie - many of the scenes felt awkward. See the original - it's a truly enjoyable movie; the soundtrack incredible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightfully Sweet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Manhattan, the workaholic Kate (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is the chef of the 22 Bleecker Restaurant owned by Paula (Patricia Clarkson), who sent her to a therapist (Bob Balaban) because she has no other interest in life but cooking and controlling her kitchen. When her only sister dies in a car accident, Kate becomes the guardian of her niece Zoe (Abigail Breslin), who can not overcome the loss of her mother. Paula orders Kate to take a couple of days off to care of Zoe; when Kate returns to the work, she finds that Paula hired the sub-chef Nick (Aaron Eckhart) without her approval. Nick explains that he is honored of working with Kate, but the jealous Kate does not trust in him and believes he wants her position. When Zoe gets close to Nick and invites him to have dinner with Kate and her, she changes her feelings for Nick. But when his work is recognized by the clients of the restaurant, Kate believes she committed a mistake."No Reservations" is delightfully sweet, with a nice romance supported by the magnificent chemistry of Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhart; a good story; a wonderful soundtrack; and the visual of splendorous dishes. The beauty of Catherine Zeta-Jones is awesome, and I really loved her character and this entertaining feel-good movie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Sem Reservas" ("Without Reservations")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a longtime fan of the original of this movie (Bella Martha/Mostly Martha), and everything that makes that movie great and enjoyable to watch is missing from this one. I miss the slow pace, the build-up of characters and their style in small gestures, the dominance of lights and moods and moves over dialog. I don't think that the story itself is enough. Martha/Kate is more secluded, and Mario/Nick is not a clown. In most of the cases the things that makes one scene great in the original, its is not working in its copy here. The small alterations take away the tension. My opinion is that you should go and see the original. It'll worth the inconvenience of subtitles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why remake Mostly Martha?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much as I really like Catherine Zeta-Jones, I wondered once again, why remake a good movie? This version lacked the tension and passion of Mostly Martha. It was a clear rip off. Maxime Foerste was more convincing as a hurting child who healed with love. I couldn't believe Abigail Breslin. Martina Gedeck owned this role. Unfortunately Zeta-Jones should have found another one that she could own (she has other roles she does own.). Sergio Castellitto was good as a vulnerable but joyful Italian. Aaron Eckhart seemed passionless in comparison. This version was pleasant but bland.The love between Mario and Martha was perhaps predictable but satisfying. The therapist added an interesting bit of color that didn't seem important. I liked it when at the end he said he'd be back but the movie was over before he returned. I have Mostly Martha at home. Every now and then I revisit it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chef ends up bringing up her niece and dealing with another chef where she works.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Know what I wish? That Hollywood, et al., would stop re-making European and Asian hits, or actually even Hollywood classics, and leave well enough alone. No Reservations is a remake of Germany's Mostly Martha (go rent the original and you'll see why there is no comparison)and is a pain to endure. Even the opening scene in which the chef is explaining to her shrink about how to best cook quail cannot compare and the scene comes across as fake. Zeta-Jones had no spark in this movie at all, not that I have seen anything extraordinary come from her in the few movies I have seen her in. She has had her moments, but in this movie, other than the scene where she is crying in the freezer, her talents are wasted. She also looked tired. Maybe that was supposed to be "the look," but it started from the very beginning. I got the sense that she really did not want to do this project, and even if she did, it felt like she did not. Eckhart, cute as can be, especially when he gives you one of those big grins, is also wasted in this film and quite frankly his being "Italian-like" did not work. Breslin was boring, and even when crying did not show a lot of emotion. It was like she was forced to cry, or do anything really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful cover of a nice movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is only one word to define the whole movie, that is: awful. How "Mostly Martha" was remade is awful. The title of the movie is awful. The actors are awful. And the idea of combining good cooking and USA is awful. If you have seen "Bella Martha", well that is the original title and it means "Beautiful Martha", this one is a punch in the stomach. The acting of Ms.Jones is so poor and unnatural that even Jessica Alba, considered one of the worst actresses (http://www.razzies.com/history/05nomActr.asp) would have done better. Not to mention the cook, who would better play a different role. And the little girl... not worth mentioning. Bella Martha was a very nice movie, an authentic one... why was it remade? There was a story.... here they took it out. There is no story... What shall it represent? In one way also this movie was perfect. You know when all ingredients fit together? Well this is the case here. A perfect Crap....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie teasers shown on TV focused on the movie as a sharp, dark comedy. I was disappointed. The little girl's grief had the woman in the row behind me crying so that her children were asking what was wrong. That part of the movie was a downer for me. I wasn't expecting it. Spoiler below: When a boss takes on her underling as her lover, she is courting disaster, personally and professionally. I couldn't believe the head chef would risk that since that kitchen was "her life".There was a plodding "made for TV movie" aura when Catherine Zeta Jones takes her niece to the first day of her new school.

		<shortDescription>Do not have any reservations whatsoever about seeing this film, if you are a romantic comedy fan, it is terrific!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kate (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is a sensational chef who commands the kitchen in a posh Big Apple restaurant. However, she is totally obsessed with her job and saves little time for anything else. As Kate occasionally gets irate at patrons who make any small complaints about the food, her boss (Patricia Clarkson) sends her to a counselor for therapy. Yet, even that does little good to bring a balance to her life. Things change dramatically, though, when Kate's sister dies in an automobile crash and leaves her young daughter, Zoe (Abigail Breslin) in her sibling's care. Having to take a week off from her work, Kate is chagrined to find that, upon her return, the boss lady has hired an Italian sous chef named Nick (Aaron Eckhart) to help keep the pace. Yet, these two radical alterations to Kate's life prove to be very important. Will there be a happy ending for our heroine? This remake of the very fine Mostly Martha is a great new choice for fans of romantic comedy/drama. A good deal of the credit should be extended to the nice cast, as the gorgeous Zeta-Jones, the very handsome Eckhart, and the talented Breslin make a terrific trio. Clarkson is also quite good in a supporting role. The New York City setting has never been lovelier, while the costumes and production values are great as well. As for the script, it is does not shine as brightly as the original German one but it has plenty of zest and heart. Do not have any reservations about marking the calendar to see this film. It is a feast of fun and feel-good moments.</fullReview>

Not really, but a real actress with an infinite range (and, yes, thank you very much, I have seen the Baader Meinhof complex !). You know who she reminds me of ? Nathalie Baye, another understated, unassuming actress who I also saw when she began, and becomes more and more beautiful as she ages.

		<shortDescription>Shameless remake of a much better film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The producers of this film should acknowledge in Line 1 that they have done a remake of "Mostly Martha" with Martina Gedeck. In many scenes the story lines are almost identical to the previous film, meaning they did not simply base the 2007 version on some "public" novel, but lifted the story from a far superior earlier filmed version of the story.By recasting this film with Hollywood "hotties" Aaron Eckhart and Catherine Zeta-Jones, the crass commercial attempt is too obvious. These actors add nothing to the story, and the film has no depth, no feeling. But put those names on the marquee, and add charming child-star Abigail Breslin, American audiences should flock to the theatres, right? Too bad this 2007 version is not very well done - witness the mediocre critical response.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the trailers for this movie, it looked like a good romantic comedy. I expected some light fluffy fun. Instead, I was bored and a little depressed.Honestly, there was no chemistry between the leads at all, and the movie had little, if anything, that was funny about it. The little girl was adorable - when she cried, I cried - but I thought they might have used someone a little bit younger in the role.Either way, the movie was filled with long, dull silences or swelling opera music. I'm not anti-opera, but I would have preferred them to spend that time letting us get to know the characters, who were all stiff and underdeveloped.I was really disappointed in this movie. The whole time I watched it I kept thinking of how much better it could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been so much better. No chemistry between main characters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of my favorite movies have plots as predictable as this one. You know the main characters are going to end up together in the end, but you don't care because the movie is well written, the main characters are well defined and likable, and there is a chemistry between them. I can't quite put my finger on why I was so disappointed in this movie, but I think overall everything just seems too forced. There is zero chemistry between the main actors (Aaron Eckhart as Nick and Catherine Zeta-Jones as Kate) and no explanation, other than Nick's admiration for Kate as a chef, of why Nick falls for such a brooding, clammed-up woman. As a few of the other posters have noted, CZJ is not well cast and she is just not likable in this role. Aaron Eckhart seems to overcompensate for CZJ's dullness, by offering the audience some well needed relief by clowning around in the kitchen in his first scene. I would have liked to have known more about Nick's back story. Maybe it would have explained his attraction to Kate more. I am a fan of Mr. Eckhart's, and think that maybe if he had a different leading lady it would have made all the difference.The "instant happy family riding in the park scene" after Nick and Kate get together and go riding with Kate's niece (Abigail Breslin), is incredibly forced and I found myself checking my watch. One bright spot of the movie is Abigail Breslin, who is perfect in her role and was a pleasure to watch. She played her part very well and very genuinely.I plan on renting the original since that has gotten great reviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"No Reservations" is an obnoxious, woman-hating, heartless, paint-by-numbers exercise. You can't blame the cast; they've all been brilliant in other productions. Director Scott Hicks and the screenwriters show no feel for romantic comedy.Kate (Catherine Zeta-Jones) has it all. She is exquisitely beautiful, a highly successful chef; she has a lovely apartment. There's a problem: She is a female. So, what she really needs is a man to come along and tell her that she and her life are garbage. That man is Nick (Aaron Eckhart). Eckhart has done really well playing child molesters and other assorted creeps. He is tall, he has abundant blond hair, and his chin alone should be on Mount Rushmore, but he gives off a creepy vibe. He can't play romantic comedy. And he's never convincing here. It's even worse that his job is to tell this spectacular, admirable woman that her life is garbage and that she needs to surrender to him in order to blossom as a "real woman." Nick cooks better than Kate, he's even a better mother. In other words, Nick bests Kate at the skills most frequently associated with women: cooking and nurturing children.This is the kind of botch of a romantic comedy where you know that characters who can't stand each other are now falling in love because, suddenly, very loud and intrusive opera arias and classic pop songs play on the soundtrack. Beware! Beware! Abigail Breslin, who was so wonderful in "Little Miss Sunshine," can't rescue this paint-by-numbers movie. She moves in with Kate and Kate gets to experience the joys and tensions of motherhood, but it's all so mechanical -- "Oh, this is the 'I hate you' scene; oh, this is the pillow fight scene" -- you never believe it or care about the characters.Brian F. O'Byrne, as the somewhat-cute neighbor with an Irish accent, and Patricia Clarkson, as Kate's boss, come off best ? probably because they have the least screen time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most predictable movie I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've never seen a romantic comedy before, then this will delight you to no end, as it has all the necessary components: great acting and dialog, witty banter, chemistry between all members of the cast, and a nicely weighed smattering of heartfelt (and even sad) moments.The problem is, if you've seen more than a couple of others in the same genre, you will likely - as was I - be bored to tears watching No Reservations. It was worth it for the couple of laughs and great performances, but I doubt I'll watch it again.Fans of either of the leads will doubtless enjoy it at least a bit, as they complement each other so perfectly; and who knew Lenny Kravitz's daughter was 20 years old already?! (She's in it very briefly.) Overall, I gave this a 5/10 due to the redundancy, but if it's not your usual fare, it will probably seem more like a 7 or 8 to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, Big Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recall years back, Michael Douglas wanted his wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones, to be in a romantic film because he felt his wife had all the goods. No doubt she does, but NOT in this film. A colossal waste of time, no story, no character development, no chemistry, nada. This was not the vehicle that we all hoped this film would be, boring and a HUGE disappointment. Didn't even watch the whole film, torture. Catherine Zeta-Jones was obviously trained in how to work a kitchen, move around, present a dish but this wasn't the food network, nothing learned here and once her counterpart appeared, supposedly a romantic interest brewing, where was the chemistry. The poor slob on the second floor of her building trying all the ploys to connect and no character development there. The loss of her sister was poorly played out as who knew there was a closeness. The sister's daughter just was plopped here and there with something that was supposed to draw you in, NOT. Just a waste of movie time. The promoters certainly did their job to put this lack-luster film on all the networks tempting you with all kinds of teasers. Sorry to say, don't spend a dime.</fullReview>

It wasn't funny, it wasn't original, and it wasn't entertaining. I kept hoping there would be some sort of climax, but the progression of events was flat and mind-numbingly dull. I'd say the worst part of going to "No Reservations" was the audience. The numerous "awwws" from preteens and middle-aged women made me want to cut off my fingers and eat them one by one,then regurgitate them and eat them again. Yep. It was that bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a cutesy, Styrofoam-plastic, Hollywood remake of a beautiful and moving German film, 'Mostly Martha'. 'No Reservations tells, blow by blow, exactly the same story - and even the lines trailed on IMDb are directly lifted from the original: Therapist: Kate/Martha, I'm sure you will be able to prevent the worst from happening. Kate/Martha: And that would be? Therapist: That he will tolerate you for any length of time. And yet, No Reservations, is unrecognizable as the offspring of its lovely parent. It's pleasant, forgettable stuff. After all, what can you expect from a romantic comedy? Listen up, Hollywood; 'Mostly Martha', with its movingly drawn, flawed, three dimensional characters, its loving lenses into a compelling world AND the humor, the romance, the feel-good journey through transformation, is what we have a right to expect!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The central relationship walks on well trodden ground - some friction and to and fro, a resistant woman eventually gives in to charm, they get together, then they break up before the finale where they amazingly reunite. Typical Hollywood tripe. Everything about the relationship and the adoption was lifted out of a manual. But the worst part of the movie was the meandering silences - in total the movie had about 10 minutes of actual dialogue, the rest of the time we watched with overlaid music as the characters wandered around performing everyday tasks failing to emit any emotions that added value to the plot. Largely forgettable fare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailers for the movie, I understood to be a comedy. When I actually watched this movie, it turns out to be a depressing movie. Catherine Zeta Jones makes great movie, more on block busters, big screen, musicals or playing the bad guys, and other action type movies. This is somewhat of a depressing movie, and a child who is too mysterious, and a competing chef Nick where the scripts are bad, the chemistry is bad. I like movie about cooks like Ratatouille, or Mostly Martha. The characters of the movies should have been the child who is headstrong but clear in her depression (demanding), rather than mysterious. While the Nick the cook, should have lighter and more comedic, but yet has some of his own weaknesses, such as lack of organization, slow orders, extremely emotional, but brilliant in creativity. This is the CLASSIC stereotype and it is more realistic. I mean how could Nick be so perfect as shown in the movie. On the other hand, Kate should have been the staunch disciplinarian, everything on schedule, but aren't too emotional when customers get displeased. Characterization of this movie needs work. Everyone has weaknesses and they try to make amends for each weaknesses. On the other hand, there is a problem about the backstabbing boss and where all this fits in the movie. A movie would be much better focused if the owner is somewhat of a an old restaurant owner overlooking with enough freedom so that both master cooks can fight it out, for better focus. All in all, the marketing people made this movie worse than it really is since I expected to be a comedy, not a drama. If characterization aside, Jodie Foster would better do the drama portion than the shallow Catherine Zeta Jones, for example. So I'd rather watch Mostly Martha than this one. It's a disappointment on characters, casting, and script. Directing is good, production is great, music is wonderful the story needs work. A pure plagiarized movie with newer actors would have worked better then a modified story as this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I spelled that right. This movie is so predictable, the actual word needs additional letters to exemplify the predictability. From the moment the principal characters and situation are introduced, it is paint-by-numbers as to where this plot will take us. The foreshadowing was as subtle as a two ton sledgehammer. You could take numerous pieces of dialogue and anticipate the role it would play in the ending.Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhardt did decent jobs in undemanding roles and Abigail Breslin played the cute role admirably. It's just that the movie brought absolutely nothing new to the romantic comedy genre. The romance was tepid and the laughs were weak and few. Sure, it's an OK movie if you have nothing to watch, but you won't miss anything by missing this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually I don't watch or like romantic comedies, but this one was surprisingly entertaining and enjoyable. The story was good, a lot like Raising Helen but without the charm of Kate Hudson, and also a decent adaptation from the German film Mostly Martha. The plot although it was a little predictable, it convince me gratefully. It has some very funny moments, the drama was acceptable and the romance was credible. Great cast, the acting was very decent from everyone, Catherine Zeta Jones with a role that fits her really well, Aaron Eckhart very good performance, he is a very versatile actor, the chemistry between Zeta Jones and Eckhart is awesome, you can really feel the attraction between them. And Abigail Breslin again with a very solid performance, she is building a very strong career despite of her very young age. The soundtrack was simply excellent, choosing classic music gives the movie a unique and enjoyable feeling. In conclusion, this movie is like a big slice of chocolate cake, you enjoy it to the end, but can't support another one. A film that girls will love and excellent to watch it with a love one. Not recommendable if you are single.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing Entrée with an Appetizing Side Dish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There really is only one reason to watch this barely adequate and utterly predictable movie about an uptight chef Kate Armstrong (Catherine Zeta Jones) whose life changes when she inherits her orphaned niece Zoe (Abigail Breslin) after her sister is killed in a car wreck. And that reason is to watch Aaron Eckhart (Nick) who, with his floppy haircut and appealingly laddish attitude, looks good enough to slap between two slices of organic Pannini and eat with an olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette dip and a few finely diced sun dried tomatoes. He reminds me of Sean Bean. The thought that he might take his shirt off really was the only thing that kept me awake until the end. He removed his apron petulantly several times, but to my disappointment, never went further.I can't be too critical because I was watching it on pay per view at home, so it hadn't cost me the price of two movie tickets at least, and I was brought up to be grateful for small mercies. But really, this is Rom Com at its most formulaic. Zeta Jones gives a very flat, monotonous performance, she seemed utterly lacking in passion, (possibly due to the amount of time she apparently spent in the cold store at the restaurant? Thirty takes in there can't have been fun) and her face barely changed expression throughout the whole movie. Abigail Breslin was pretty good as the niece, she's such an appealing little girl that it's quite impossible to criticize her, and anyway I loved her in Little Miss Sunshine. Patricia Clarkson is always good value and I can't really fault her performance as the restaurant owner, because she seemed very underused, given what a good actor she is and how little she had to do here. But the whole thing is just so clichéd, much of the dialog banal, and the outcome so obvious. This is the cinematic equivalent of paint by numbers, and Zeta Jones and Eckhart generate little heat on screen.Nick likes Italian food (doubtless indicating his burning inner passion) and cooks to the sound of Puccini. His appearance in Kate's kitchen at 22 Bleecker (the restaurant's name) predictably ruffles her feathers but his uncanny ability to bond with her niece by cooking pizza and building a Bedouin tent in the living room, brings Kate around and, despite a few stumbles along the way, she ends up giving him her prized possession. No, not her honour. But her recipe for saffron sauce.I'm being very unfair here, aren't I? I mean Rom Com is Rom Com, and we all know what we are letting ourselves in for when we sign up. But does it always have to be so mind numbingly dull?</fullReview>

I think, the blossoming relationship between Kate and Zoe, is very cute and Kate and Nick's relationship is adorable, also. I think films like this work well, because it shows how two people can bond from almost no relationship at all. I love Catherine Zeta Jones, as an actress, Aaron Eckhart is hot!! Abigail Breslin is also very cute!( She was also in Raising Helen) I think it's also great how the story is different from usual. Most are about people with high-paying jobs who have to come back down to earth, however this is just about a chef, which is great because it's just simple!</fullReview>

It wouldn't have surprised me if one of the two had produced a kitchen knife and stabbed the other multiple times. Okay, enough of that. The movie is, how shall I put it? Nice. Catherine Zeta Jones manages a sort of warmth that I had never noticed before in her and Aaron, well, he just goes for it, reveling in this film persona that he's been developing for years. The tender macho type. The food looks great but not as great as in "Big Night" remember that one? Some character touches are really spot on. The city and the dishes are photographed beautifully, the human beings a little less. I almost walked out during a musical montage but I'm a glad I didn't. All in all. Fun.

		<fullReview>This was pretty much what I expected although more on the romantic/drama than romantic comedy side of things. The story has been done many times before so this is predictable yet somehow still didn't feel redundant to me. It follows a workaholic New York City chef (this time around) who must suddenly deal with taking care of her orphaned 9 year old niece.Catherine Zeta-Jones is suitably (bitchy) giving off a no-nonsense intensity as she runs her kitchen. I did enjoy (as always) Aaron Eckhart as her easy going love interest and Abigail Breslin puts in a great performance as the orphaned niece. I felt sad for her and she seemed to bring out the best in both of her leads. The romance here is meh, whatever, the story brainless and the ending kinda cheesy but still an easily watchable movie. 11/17/15</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally uninteresting - had potential to do a whole lot better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie about a uptight chef, who faces a turmoil of emotions, happy, sad all at the same time. So tries to adapt to the new situations. That is a very strong script and yet the movie is boring as hell.When i looked at the trailer i knew it would be really fun and Catherina Zeta Jones is a able actor to pull this off. But no, this is extremely dismal performance for the actress. By far this is the worst performance and am not just talking about being a perfectionist in the kitchen, her love interest with Aaron Eckhart and a likable aunt with her niece she falls in all places and really low.The movie starts off in a very interesting note, and shows the actress in the kitchen and cuts back and forth with a therapist and then moves on to show the tragedy in her life and niece moving with her. It was very intriguing and i really thought this could go somewhere, but after all that am not sure what happened to all the flamboyance and grit that the movie had. It just fell apart and i was hoping despite this, the acting would be good enough to carry the movie and disappointment again.This movie confused me a lot, i understand the little girl was going through a really difficult time, but many times her anger was totally not needed. Running off in the road, going to her mom's grave for a reason which was beyond reason. Standing in freezing cold for no reason, the girl looked appallingly bad. And there was Aaron Eckhart, he was again at his lowest low, when he came in to the movie i was hoping a bonding issue with the actress would eventually turn into love and would have its fun moments.None of that existed, he was this exuberant and passionate guy and such a character will have to be fun in this uptight movie, he had no such moments. I don't even understand why was he fired in the first place and the chemistry between the characters was the worst. The aunt-niece was pathetic, lead actors chemistry was abysmal and the movie had lost all the finesse, passion and short did not have the heart to carry it through.The screenplay was really bad, dialogues were worse and the scenes in the trailer where Catherina Zeta Jones blows out on a customer complaint was split into 2 sections. One in the start and one right before the end, which totally doesn't make sense. The characters should grown into you, not go back and forth on the same emotions and insanely annoy you.The movie should have focused on the bonding between actress and little girl and build the story around it, it would be a really fun and interesting to watch, but instead goes in all different directions and loses our interests after the first 20 minutes which is a huge disappointment. Never seen such a wasted script and feel really for the sub-standard and lackluster attempt by the director on the script. A movie totally worth skipping.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Reservation for This Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No Reservations (2007): Dir: Scott Hicks / Cast: Catherine Zeta-Jones, Aaron Eckhart, Abigail Breslin, Patricia Clarkson, Bob Balaban: Title physically suggests the restaurant setting for which Catherine Zeta-Jones works but symbolically it addresses her inner struggle for relationships. She plays an uptight chef who is given custody of her niece when her sister dies. A male chef is hired and she is put off with his ability to ease tension in the kitchen. Setting presents charm but structure is predictable. It lacks romance and highlights grief. Directed by Scott Hicks who previously made Snow Falling on Cedars and Shine. He is aided by good locations and a terrific lead. Zeta-Jones holds her own as a respected chef who suddenly lapses into responsibility for her niece and struggling to cope with the stress. Aaron Eckhart had potential as the stress managing new chef but the role is reduced to romantic clichés. Abigail Breslin plays the niece who will struggle to adapt, hate Zeta-Jones's food, and eat whatever Eckhart puts in front of her. Patricia Clarkson is flat as Zeta-Jones's boss. Bob Balaban makes an appearance playing Zeta-Jones's therapist who tells her the obvious bull. While the film makes reservations for emotional healing its delivery is far from perfect when factoring in that it was advertized as a romantic comedy and delivers on leftovers from other films.

		<fullReview>Kate (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is the intense perfectionist head chef of an upscale Manhattan restaurant. She has anger issues and the restaurant owner Paula (Patricia Clarkson) sends her to a therapist (Bob Balaban). She lives an intense lonely single life refusing to date her neighbor Sean. Her sister dies in a car crash. Her niece Zoe (Abigail Breslin) survives and is placed with her. Zoe's father is unknown. They both struggle. Paula hires new chef Nick Palmer (Aaron Eckhart) to pick up the slack which only angers Kate.It's a remake of 'Mostly Martha'. This is a bit lighter in tone than the original. There are some minor changes but they kept Leah pregnant with short hair. I'm glad they lost Zoe's father in this version. It was a bit of a distraction in the original.Breslin is a great child actor. She is the big improvement over the original. She and Zeta-Jones have a compelling story. The romance with Aaron Eckhart is a little lacking. He has limited chemistry with Zeta-Jones. They're also relying on a few too many montages. I would also prefer a lot more food porn in a cooking movie. Nevertheless, this is a nice story of coming together.</fullReview>

Beautifully shot and genuinely acted, this to me was the kind of rom-com I actually would prefer to watch.Not that OTT crap like Love Actually, The Holiday etc, packed with Hollywood cheese that actually causes some acid reflux and makes you want to punch the screen.

		<fullReview>So upon having to watch this film while both my teacher was out sick and I was in class sick, I really didn't expect much all things being considered. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie's ability to bring up emotions.Won't bother explaining the basics of the film since you can get that straight from the description. What I will say is that although it doesn't have the deepest story or background, it is charming. It will make you feel legitimately happy or sad for the characters and smile at some of it's quirkier moments.Being a romance film, it obviously has the downside of being fairly unrealistic, at least in my opinion. Everything centers around romance in some way and it seems a bit more like a dream that belongs to the girl in high school that works 24/7 to over achieve and yet never gets little affection, so that did leave a bad taste in my mouth when looking back on it.It's something to watch when you have a cold since emotions are the only things you can feel when sick. It's also something you only need to watch once to fully enjoy.If you have the time then go ahead and watch it, but if you're looking for something that will keep you thinking or sitting on the edge of your seat, you're in the wrong place.</fullReview>

I wouldn't want to be a "proud" writer of the screenplay, nor I would want to be a director of this rip-off. Not surprisingly, the quintessentially Hollywoodesque actors, who clearly had nothing to do that year decided to avoid real life with this production. Let me list: cheesy dialogs and phrases, full make up during an industrial kitchen job, completely ignored psychiatrist character, the young girl was not made for this role (she belongs in the fairy-tale movies). It also made less than twice the budget, while making roughly four times gross box office of a movie that was made in 2001 (and it's in damn German language!).

This movie has a sweet and emotional story line. The actors are all great but Catherine Zeta-Jones ( who is so beautiful) and Abigail Breslin ( who is so super talented) are superb. The story line is predictable but it is the emotions portrayed by the actors that has made the movie watchable. If you are looking for a movie with real comedy and romance then this is not for you. I didn't find anything much funny here nor is there much romance. In fact the romance part is quite brief. But what I found nice here are the portrayal of: love of a brilliant chef for her work, the relationship between an aunt and her niece which grows more lovely throughout the movie and of course the sweet romance between the main leads.So if you are up for a nice family movie, then this is the movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No Reservations misses the spark with subtle romance, dull drama and toned-down emotions, and a dollop of sophistication and pomp in the scenery and furniture.No Reservations by Scott Hicks is a 2007 romantic comedy about 'one of the better chefs in town', a control freak, Kate (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and an exuberant and Opera-loving Nick (Aaron Eckhart) who comes and topsy-turvy her life in a very slow motion, and she starts to break her own rules when Zoe (Abigail Breslin), Kate's niece starts to like Nick and finds in him and Kate a family; and the movie takes a predictable turn and we see a budding romance between the two during their talks about food and recipes and the cold fights, but the spark is missing. First of the only two (and very bland) kisses happens after the first half.Nothing strikes out much in the 1 hour 40 minute movie, except the opera playing in the background. A line that stuck out, said by Kate's therapist (Bob Balaban) is 'it's the recipes you create yourself that are the best'. Hence, there is no cook book for life, and you can and should break your own rules as you see fit.Predictable for dummies, you can easily skip watching this, if you are looking for a get-lost-in-the-world-of-romance movie. A little flicker in their romance would have spiced things up enough to have me give it an above-average rating, considering the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After six years, I finally got to see this and while part of me expected a romantic comedy, the fact this was mostly a drama with some light moments was fine with me as I really enjoyed seeing Ms. Catherine Zeta-Jones playing a chef who's used to doing things her way before having to deal with her niece Abigail Breslin after her mother dies and then also then dealing with another chef at her restaurant played by Aaron Eckhart. This was both a touching and cheerful movie that had me mostly smiling during the most heart tugging scenes. Really, the atmosphere was just good enough for whatever the sequences called for. So on that note, I highly recommend No Reservations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Reservations (2007) **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had some reservations about allowing my girlfriend to pick tonight's movie; it was only fair, since she has been willing to sit through a lot of my movies lately. She's a serious Romantic, and nine out of ten times her choices are Chick Flicks of this type, not all of which have been difficult to endure. But this one was more of the same ol' same ol' ... I've learned it is a remake of a German film called "Bella Martha", but to me it was more like a remake of virtually any other romance story of recent decades.Catherine Zeta-Jones plays a talented chef who's so good at the foods she prepares that her boss won't fire her, even though she is a major pain to work with and constantly barges out of the kitchen to confront paying customers when they feel their meal isn't prepared the way they like it. Instead, her employer makes her go to a therapist. Then she suffers a blow when her sister dies and she has to take in her little niece, having had no experience in child raising. One day she encounters a feisty and endearingly off color new male cook at work, who is written straight out of every other 'outrageous boy meets apprehensive girl' narrative you've seen -- she is appalled by him at the start, but the kid loves him and as time goes on, well ... you know... I mean, really. Talk about typical, cliché'd and predictable. It wasn't a "bad" film, just overly familiar and routine. Jones is pretty good in her part but there isn't much more to recommend other than that. ** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie when I first started getting interested in cooking, I happen to like it. I know it's a remake and Mostly Martha was really good but this movie had it's moments; it had it's cute moments, mostly all of them center around Nick, the scenes of the three together making the pizza I thought happen to be a cute scene. It also had it's sad and dramatic scenes (I won't say anything more) which I think are handled pretty well in my opinion. I think it's a sweet movie that made me smile and laugh, it's a cute movie and I think actors did a good job, Catherine Zeta Jones and Aaron Eckhart are both great actors in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What does it take to make one happy most of the time? A little bit of love and good food is what is perfectly required. "No Reservation" is exactly what it tries to convey, a perfect blend of both.The movie begins with an interesting conversation that sets up the whole story of the film until when something uncertain happens that changes the climate of the story. The story line is spot on. The characters in the movie (Catherine Zeta, Abigail and Aaron) have brought in their best, especially Catherine in most parts. It seems to be natural most of the time but yet, faints of over acting are also evident and shown.An obsessed chef finds a new beginning when she has to take care of her sister's daughter. She then gets to meet an interesting colleague who tears apart her thoughts and sets in a romantic feeling that she was unaware of for a very long time.The end is predictable but on the whole it is definitely worth to watch it once. When two important things such as love and food come together, the mix is definitely magical and yes it feels good!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary Set-Backs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are good and bad romantic comedies. Thankfully, this plays out well. It just has some things that should have been tweaked before being released to theaters. The central problem is how the screenplay was written. It just doesn't allow the main character to develop enough until it is really late in the film. Along with this are some other unnecessary set backs that will be addressed as well. The issue is that, altogether, these factors make this film not as funny as it should be and that's why it needs improvement.Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Kate, a stressed, workaholic chef that has no time for anyone but herself, or so she thinks. Why? Little does she realize, she will inherit her niece, Zoe, acted out by Abigail Breslin. Zoe loses her mother to a fatal car accident, so now it is up to Kate to take care of her, and that's not all. Kate soon finds out that she has a new co-worker, named Nick, who is performed by actor Aaron Eckhart. Little does Kate know but these two individuals will help relieve her of her problems. The problem; Kate is very thick headed and does not see this.The personality of Kate is very sarcastic and it's not a good sarcastic. There are two types of sarcasm: funny and snotty sarcasm. Kate's sarcasm is snotty and when it comes down to comedy, Kate's wisecracks are a hit or miss. There were times where she overreacted to situations and I looked at the screen saying, "Lady, it's not a big deal". As for the character of Zoe, at first she makes Kate feel uncomfortable because she's still traumatized that her mother won't be returning to Earth any time soon. But once Zoe meets Nick, she starts to turn the other cheek.What's great about the role Eckhart plays, is that he is the driving force that makes this film worth the while watching. Almost every line that Nick says in this film is upbeat and energetic. Of course, guess who puts out the fire - Kate. It's unfortunate because Nick tries really hard to earn Kate's trust and it takes Kate a long time to break down her walls. I think it's something the screenwriters should have noticed; Kate's attitude took too long of a time to change course. Adding to this is the element of Zoe's mother. I can understand why Zoe would be distraught from the beginning, but I do not understand why it was need to be inserted again much later in the film. What does this accomplish? All it does is bring the audience back to the sad, mournful feeling that was felt back in the start of the movie. This film is supposed to gradually get better over time, not get better for a while and sink back down again! That's just playing with the audience's emotions and it gets annoying after a while.Two final aspects that I did enjoy about this film was the food and music. I know it sounds silly, but because most of this film takes place in a kitchen, a lot of the things that will be observed is professionally made food. So much of it is appetizing to look at alone! At one point, I wanted to have one of the platters served to me while I watched the film. As for music, Philip Glass composed the score, with several other artist soundtracks inserted as well, i.e. Michael Bublé and Luciano Pavarotti. But what I like about Glass' score is how it evokes the emotions so easily. It truly has a poignant tune of its own.Overall No Reservations has good intentions but its "up and down" screenplay is emotionally unbalanced, making it difficult for the audience to feel the same way the characters do. Adding to the frustration is Zeta-Jones' character who takes forever to take a step in the positive direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mostly better than Mostly Martha</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I picked up No Reservations at the local library, the librarian gave me a typical recommendation: if you like that, you might want to consider Mostly Martha, of which No Reservations is an inferior remake. I liked No Reservations well enough ? it's a well-crafted, if straight-up, Rom Com ? so I picked up Mostly Martha next. I like No Reservations better.Not that there's much difference between the two. All but one of the major plot points are retained, and some scenes are copied nearly verbatim (barring language differences). So it might just come down to which movie you saw first.But there are specific aspects of No Reservations I prefer: a more fleshed-out script and editing job, as well as superior Hollywood production values (the better presentation of the food, for instance, or note the poor dubbing of Mostly Martha's Sergio Castellitto - on the German track - although maybe this is just an audio sync problem with the Paramount DVD).Mostly, though, I prefer No Reservatons for its stars. Abigail Breslin is one of the all-time great child actors, and shows it here, whereas Mostly Martha's Maxime Foerste is just a kid who tries not to look into the camera and fails. While Castellitto puts in a fine performance, Aaron Eckhart's thousand-watt charm keeps him in the running for me. And while Martina Gedeck's performance as Martha is more technically impressive and even more appealing than Kate's Kate, I find her slightly-framed, vulnerable Martha less believable as a famous chef than Catherine "Very Vigorous" Zeta-Jones - even if that's only because it's hard to shake the image of Zeta-Jones as fiery Latin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not delightful, not funny, just a rather depressing drama. Everybody is kind of bland in this film, unlike the dishes they prepare. Eckhart plays the typical "come to shake it all up" guy, but even this seems forced. The films biggest problem is its weak female lead. Not so much the acting, as the character. Why is it presented as such a psychological flaw for a woman to be passionate towards her job? Zeta-Jones' character is one that will never be happy until she gets a man, despite her protests. Breslin's arrival doesn't cause too much hassle for Zeta-Jones, making this fairly uninteresting to watch. Remember ladies, if you are focused on your career then you need professional help, and the only cure is finding a good man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Churned out by the Hollywood factory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy meets girl. Girl hates boy. Boy is not that keen on girl either. Boy and girl gradually change their minds. Girl loves boy. Boy loves girl. All ends happily. The above plot is an old one but (in the right hands) a good one; it has served as the basis of a number of classic works of literature, such as Shakespeare's "The Taming of the Shrew" or Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice". In the wrong hands, however, it can also serve as the basis of every trite, hackneyed Hollywood romantic comedy you've ever seen. "No Reservations" is a case in point. (I understand it was based on a German film "Mostly Martha", which I have never seen). Because rom-com is a popular genre but there are so few basic rom-com plots, the scriptwriters for such movies have to try and distinguish their efforts from everyone else's by inserting a gimmick or two in every film. The first gimmick in "No Reservations" is that it is set in the world of haute cuisine. The heroine, Kate Armstrong, is the head chef at an up-market New York restaurant, and the hero, Nick Palmer, her sous-chef. The two have (as is normal in films of this type) very different personalities. Kate is introverted and emotionally reserved. She finds it difficult to interact with other people and lives only for her work. Nick, by contrast, is a brash, outgoing extrovert who loves to play operatic arias in the kitchen at full volume, much to Kate's disgust. (Despite his English surname, Nick is said to be of Italian-American descent, and his character- loud personality, love of opera, eating spaghetti- can be seen as a compendium of Anglo-Saxon clichés about Italians).Although Nick chose to work at Kate's restaurant because of his admiration for her cooking, the personality clash between them means that they take a strong initial dislike to one another, so a second gimmick is needed as a catalyst to bring them together. Kate's sister is killed in a car accident and her young niece Zoe comes to live with her. Zoe is a shy, withdrawn child, mourning the death of her mother, and Kate finds it difficult to bond with her. Unable to find child-care, Kate takes to bringing Zoe along to the restaurant at night, where the little girl takes an immediate liking to Nick, who cooks some of his famous spaghetti for her. You can work out the rest of the story from there. Apart from the over-familiar storyline, my main problem with the film lay in the miscasting of the lovely Catherine Zeta Jones as Kate. In just about everything I've ever seen her in, going all the way back to "The Darling Buds of May" in the early nineties, Catherine's screen persona has been one characterised by passion, spiritedness and vitality. This has been true not only of other rom-coms such as "America's Sweethearts" and "Intolerable Cruelty", but also comedies ("Splitting Heirs"), costume dramas ("The Return of the Native"), musicals ("Chicago"), crime capers ("Entrapment") and action-adventure (the "Zorro" films). In all these films she has shown herself to possess talent as well as beauty, but even talented actors have their limitations, and playing repressed, withdrawn introverts like Kate seems to be something quite alien to her style of acting. This is probably the worst performance I have seen from her. Aaron Eckhart as the cheeky chappie Nick is not quite so miscast, although he seems to be coasting through the film, his main expression seeming to be a smug grin conveying the knowledge that his deeply cleft chin and carefully cultivated designer stubble make him irresistible to women, even to an old misery-boots like Kate. The film was directed by Scott Hicks, the Australian director who about a dozen years earlier had so impressed me with his "Shine", the biopic of pianist David Helfgott. He exemplifies a phenomenon I have noted with some other non-American directors who move to Hollywood; they get swallowed up by the system, seem to lose all the freshness and originality they possessed in their home countries and end up directing uninteresting, formulaic films thrillers or romantic comedies. Hicks's first American film was "Snow Falling on Cedars" which still kept some original touches, even though I did not enjoy it as much as David Guterson's novel. "No Reservations", by contrast, is just another standard product churned out by the Hollywood factory. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Reservations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard a little about this film during its release, obviously about the leading actress starring, and that it involved cooking in a restaurant, so I thought it looked like one I should try, from director Simon Hicks (Shine). Basically in Manhattan, Kate Armstrong (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is the workaholic master chef of the 22 Bleecker Restaurant owned by Paula (Patricia Clarkson) who has recommended her to a Therapist (Gosford Park's Bob Balaban) due to her cold, no-nonsense, bossy and pain in the neck behaviour. Things start to change for her when her only sister is killed in a car accident she becomes the guardian for her ten year old niece Zoe (Little Miss Sunchine's Abigail Breslin) who comes to live with her. As Kate struggles to take care of the grieving child, arriving in the restaurant is the new second/substitute chef Nick Palmer (Aaron Eckhart) who is a fan of Italian music and food, and was found because he is a fan of Kate's cooking. He explains he is honoured to work alongside her, but Kate is jealous and testy with the new arrangement, she is sure he wants to take over her role in the kitchen, and he seems to be a bit more appreciated to her. Of course she slowly realises the kitchen would not be the same without his presence and cooking skills, and when Zoe is invited to the restaurant he seems to be bringing her out of her grief stricken shell. Eventually it comes to the point when Kate and Nick are co-operating, so much so that they go out together and fall in love, and in the end, after the usual argument, bad point and fall out, things comes together in the end, and all rightful names become the name for the restaurant. Also starring Jenny Wade as Leah, Brían F. O'Byrne as Sean, Lily Rabe as Bernadette and Zoë Kravitz, Lenny's daughter as Charlotte. Zeta-Jones does well as the leading character who is a little bitchy for a while but lightens up as time goes by, Eckhart is likable, and Breslin is cute and reasonably lovable, it is a slightly predictable and cheesy story in parts, and I didn't think we saw enough delicious food preparation, but overall it is a nice romantic comedy drama. Worth watching!</fullReview>

It's based on the story of Kate, a master chef who rules her kitchen, and Nick, who is just as gifted, who comes to work for her and is seen as a rival to Kate. The movie was pretty predictable throughout the whole thing. The chemistry between Aaron Eckhart, Nick and Catherine Zeta-Jones, Kate was definitely there and they made an appealing couple and Abigail Breslin was awesome in her role, as always. If you're looking for a mediocre movie that's predictable and doesn't require much thinking, you found it in No Reservations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a movie about a head chef who must take care of her dead sister's child and who ends up having a new love interest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No Reservations is a 2007 film directed by Scott Hicks. The movie stars Catherine Zeta-Jones, Aaron Eckhart, and Abigail Breslin. It is a film about a Master Chef named Kate (Catherine Zeta-Jones) that runs the kitchen in a large high end restaurant in Manhattan. Her whole life is her job and she lives to work and not work to live. However, she gets quite a shock when her sister suddenly dies in an accident which leaves her to take care of her school age niece Zoe (Abigail Breslin). She struggles throughout the movie to split her time evenly between her niece and the job she loves so much, and has a difficult time giving her niece the parental attention that she needs. However, a young, funny, and attractive new opera loving sous-chef named Nick (Aaron Eckhart) comes into the restaurant and sparks Kate's interest. Nick gets along with Zoe and Kate begins falling for him. However, tension rises when the manager of the restaurant offers nick Kate's job.This is a move that has a range of different emotions. The film can be funny, touching, and also sad. All in all the plot of the movie was very interesting, however it is very cliché and predictable. As soon as the young attractive new sous-chef entered into the movie, we automatically knew that Kate was going to fall for him, even though at that time in the movie, she hated him. You can see where the film is going all of the time.Catherine Zeta Jones does a very nice job playing Kate. She portrays the intense personality very accurately and hits the nail on the head playing a head chef. She and Abigail Breslin work great together and you can tell that there is a connection between the two. Aaron Eckhart's character did a very good job complimenting both of the characters of Kate and Zoe and I believe that he was a good choice to play that role. Nevertheless, I feel that Aaron did not give his character as much definition as Abigail and Catherine. He could have been more clear and pronounced with his emotions and actions at many times in the film in order to tell us exactly who his character was.The lighting and sound brought a nice touch to the movie and helped to give it life. It aided in portraying the different emotions in the film. When the scene was supposed to be depressing, the lighting was dark to bring down the mood. When there was scene that was supposed to look hopeful, the setting was very bright with exciting movement and music. The logistics of the movie were worked out very well.Even though the film was predictable in most parts, the story line is very warm and welcoming. It is a move that you will want to see time and time again and will not want to walk away from your TV screen when it is on. The movie is a happy ending film that will make you feel good inside after watching it, even though there won't be many surprises or any suspense in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen 'Mostly Martha' (though I plan to) but 'No Reservations' is pretty formulaic. The story isn't exactly refreshing as lonely workaholic woman suddenly has to take care of her niece while competing with and eventually falling in love with co-worker has been repeated many times in Hollywood. However, this doesn't make the film unwatchable. In spite of its predictability, it isn't boring.Even though it has a polished look, director Hicks has toned down the story and the foodiness of it adds colour (I like movies revolving around food). The movie has heart and is charming in places. The cinematography is terrific, especially the long shots. Philip Glass's score is breathtaking.Catherine Zeta Jones is superb as Kate, a workaholic and somewhat territorial, chef who suddenly has to deal with raising her niece and teaming up with Nick. She is brilliantly restrained as is Abigail Breslin who once again shines. Aaron Eckhart is a bit over the top at times (this was clearly intended to contrast Catherine's Kate but it doesn't work all the way) and his Italianness appears a little forced but otherwise he's quite alright.'No Reservations' may not be the best movie of its kind but it's quite a watchable film. Now, I have to find 'Bella Marta' (a.k.a. 'Mostly Martha').</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I missed Merryl Streep Julia &amp; J... But our TV screened this one! Yep, there was something cooking, and brewing in this story. I enjoyed it very much without going beyond this. And I agree with most of the early comments I read. It is very predictable and the characters are not developed enough to heighten this work. Abigail was a little too much miss Sunshine for me although it did not really spoil anything. I spent my very first 18 working months in a high class and busy kitchen near the Arc of Triumph in Paris and certainly could identify and appreciate the described kitchen atmosphere, known as the "coup de Feu" Yes a "firing" experience not to be forgotten. Like the wine I drink to complement my food, this film is designed to complement a lovely day, not to be criticised.6th of December 2010! This movie was again on TV, I watch it and realised I'd seen it before! I thoughroughly enjoyed it = again! and decided to check IMDb, I got a little annoyed to see many entries going on about "martha" the German original version being so much better. Some of my most liked movies are German but I have not seen this one and don't even think I'm bothered to do so unless it comes my way, (if I remember). I actually decided to write a review about it and was rather embarrassed when the system told me I had already reviewed it! Yes my pc has more memory that I! This time I did not get the "miss Sunshine" annoyance I felt in my first viewing. Instead I found I was trying to associate with her predicament and appreciate the torment / nightmare she'd to live. As for Zeta Jones I felt she did very well in this role so remote from other characters she'd played. As for the hint that she's miscast on the ground of her good look. I don't believe there is a look for a job. And so often I find myself a little jealous of high achievers who also look so good. I was well entertained - again and by skilled people, although I think I like well made, original and intelligent movies. Entertainment for the greatest number is a very worthwhile effort!</fullReview>

The cinematography was good but besides it being revolved around chefs everything else is just very cliché. Oh and Little Miss Sunshine was very irritating in this movie although Abigail Breslin seems to be a bit irritating in every movie she is in cause she plays a lot of roles where she is whinny. It has some decent flashes of cooking, but food really didn't play a big part in the movie than I expected which was a big disappointment for me. This film had some good potential, the cast was great but they just had very little to work with. I like a good light hearted romantic comedy but this was just bland.

		<fullReview>This romantic comedy touches a lot of familiar bases, including an orphaned niece (Abigail Breslin) of a career woman (Catherine Zeta-Jones as a no-nonsense chef) who has no idea of how to deal with her new charge and a guy who does (Aaron Eckhart as the second chef in the restaurant kitchen whom Zeta-Jones's character feels threatened by). Figuring the outcome is simpler than a wooden puzzle for your average six-year old. However, the beautiful Zeta-Jones and the handsome Eckhart make a reasonably plausible romantic pair, and Ms. Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine) does well as the glue that eventually binds them together. This is a good movie to watch on the DVD in your bedroom with a bowl of popcorn between you and your significant other. It makes no demands whatsoever on your imagination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cute romantic drama that convinced me Eckhart can be romantic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this film on HBO after wanting to see it since it came out nearly two years ago (hard to imagine!).The film tells the story of Kate, a workaholic head chef at a New York restaurant who suddenly finds herself becoming the guardian of her recently orphaned niece, Zoe (played wonderfully by Abigail Breslin). While Kate is working hard to run "her" kitchen AND take care of her niece, she finds herself trying to resist falling for the new sous-chef Nick, a somewhat free spirit who prefers to have some fun in the kitchen. This clashes with Kate's strict straight-to-business attitude. He also helps Zoe come out of her shell by introducing her to the world of cooking and food in a way Kate could not. Sparks start to fly between the two chefs as they spend more time getting to know each other and Zoe.I like Catherine Zeta-Jones in many of her roles. This film is no exception. The only time I didn't like her was when she was being a witch towards Eckhart's Nick. Other than that, I liked the character. She was a good example of someone who has many flaws they fail to address and hides behind something their good at to prevent others from getting too close. Aaron Eckhart is charming and fun to watch as Nick. I had seen him in Paycheck, Thank You for Smoking and, of course, The Dark Knight. This role was very good. I liked his lightness and his constant teasing of Zeta-Jones's Kate. I also liked his chemistry with little Abigail Breslin. The two seemed to genuinely be having fun with the roles when they were together. Abigail Breslin is once again proving her talent as a young actress in a role that is both heartwarming and heartbreaking. Her handling of the story involving the character losing her mother is very good and proves to me that she can handle serious roles just fine.Obviously the story is not without its own flaws. I found the therapy sessions that Kate attends to be a bit of a nuisance. I know they were supposed to be there for the purpose of helping Kate discover ways of helping Zoe and herself get through their pain and, as a plot device, develop Kate's character. But I personally didn't care for them that much. I felt that they could've handled Kate's insecurities by way of a few scenes between Kate and Nick talking about each other's past and what got them to the point they're at now. I know, that would've been clichéd. The story was also very predictable. Whenever a significant event occurred, you could pretty much tell what would happen next.Despite its flaws, I enjoyed the movie. The performances were very good, the characters were believable, and it had its romantic and comedic moments. A good date movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I haven't seen Mostly Martha, to which most reviewers are comparing this movie, so I can't comment on the similarities. Yes, we have seen this situation in many pictures: Driven careerist side-tracked by the introduction of an orphan relative or equivalent. This is found in Baby Boom, Three Men and a Baby, even Penny Serenade. No Reservations is not the equal of these, but is up for honorable mention.Zeta-Jones is adequate as the career chef whose structured life is intruded upon simultaneously by her niece newly orphaned by the untimely death of Zeta-Jones' sister, and the new loosey-goosey chef in her tightly controlled kitchen.Since you know what's gonna happen (orphan and aunt don't get along, guy and aunt don't get along, guy and orphan get along, guy and aunt then get along, etc.), it's how the movie takes you through it that is important. No reservations tries hard, and succeeds on most levels.An enjoyable watch, but no classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>None of the actors fell prey to "overacting"--i.e. chewing the scenery. Their characters are believable and I found my self warming to them and their respective "issues." This movie deftly handles a difficult subject--tragic death and the art of living. It was not heavy-handed. It did not go over the top in a way that makes a viewer feel manipulated. Rather it provided a story and plot that was entertaining and rich with insights into life and death: how it affects many of us. It is, in my opinion, a graceful and entertaining movie. Catherine Zeta Jones is outstanding. She nailed the character and did so without looking like she was working too hard. All the cast created a sense of reality that quickly pulls a viewer into the movie. I would encourage everyone to watch this movie. I had no expectations and was delighted with everything about it--cinematography, settings, plot, characters, etc. This is a graceful and entertaining movie. The director did a wonderful job of dealing with a difficult topic. I will watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly Marta Redone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This American remake of the 2002 German film MOSTLY MARTA barely captures the delicacy of German template. While Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the part of Master Chef Kate functioning on the edge with a great deal of sensitivity, the American version fails to capture the attraction of opposites in the German original MOSTLY MARTA. A major element of the conflict of opposites in the original MOSTLY MARTA was the cultural conflict between the Italian sous chef and the German chef. The American film avoid the cultural clash.The funniest line from the German original could not be worked into the American copy:Mario: Why would she (your niece) want to stay with her family in sunny Italy when she can return to cold and grey Germany to live there with a nut case like you? Although NO RESERVATIONS is a well made film, it represents an alarming tread in the US theatre borrowing good films from elsewhere and trying to translate the story line into an American venue.Social circumstances are not completely congruous. The scene where Zoe, Kate's ward and niece, gets in trouble at school for telling the teacher that she works in a restaurant does not translate well into the NYC public school system which hears this everyday. In highly regimented and regulated German such a report would be an atrocity.The American theatre should abandon remakes of foreign films and strive for a degree of originality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the moment I saw the trailer last year, it was love at first sight. After watching "No Reservations" last year, I was mesmerized into purchasing the film on DVD and it just gets better through multiple viewings. When I walked out of the theater I was left with a satisfying aftertaste. From the moment the movie began I knew I was in for a treat. Maybe I'm just a sucker for movies centered around cooking and food mainly because to me, stories like that have a lot of color to it and it just brings people together so that they can enjoy it was well.Catherine Zeta-Jones is as beautiful and charming in her role as the workaholic chef Kate Armstrong and Aaron Eckhart lights up the film as the more light-hearted Nick. Watching the two of them whip up some delicious meals is enough to make your mouths water. The chemistry between the two leads is purely magical. Abigail Breslin is just adorable as she steals every scene she's in as Zoe, the orphan niece of Kate.As a fan of the romantic comedy, I thought it was brilliantly done and the beauty relies on the story, the characters and the flow of the story. It was filled with humor and sadness, but most of all the ending wrapped up nicely giving it a satisfying aftertaste. For a movie that was light-hearted and enchanting, this movie is one that succeeded in many levels. It's an automatic 9 out of 10 for me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fresh take on romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No Reservations is an enjoyable film for those who enjoy romantic comedies and the art of culinary because this movie captures both. For those who did not watch the original "Bella Martha", movie watchers will find this movie enjoyable and a fun take on the genre. Aaron (Nick) and Cathy (Kate) do a great job of playing opposites. Aaron does a great job of making you laugh and becomes the most likable character in the movie. His character is the most fun and Aaron gives a great performance. Cathy does a great job of playing the obsessive executive chef on 22 Bleeker. It's fun to watch the attraction that plays between them and the difficulty that their jobs plays in their romanceThe character of Zoey annoyed me sometimes but it didn't take to much away from the movie. I wish Zoey was less of an attention grabber.If you were to watch this movie without comparing every part of it to its original "Bella Martha" you will enjoy it. People didn't like the different take on Nicks character but it fit better with its American setting. Nick is the most fun in the movie and is a great take on the fun and charismatic friend we would all want to have. It fits well in its American setting. Although the movie may feel predictable, its enjoyable. From the direction and especially the musical score to the film make this a fun romantic comedy for all ages.I would recommend this movie to anyone who are looking for a typically fun and fresh take on the genre. It's not often when you can revolve a romantic comedy from a kitchen and get away with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts out with Kate, a short tempered chef running her own kitchen. Whenever a customer complains about the smallest thing Kate drags them out of the restaurant. When her sister and niece come to visit, they fall into a deadly car accident and her sister dies. After trying to recuperate after the death of her sister and the raising of her niece she returns to work a week later. Only to discover a new chef working there without her consent. Then things really heat up in the kitchen! The movie stars Catherine Zeta-Jones, Aaron Eckhart, and Abigail Breslin. The movie in of itself is very sweet and well acted. Especially all the acting stuff between Eckhart and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Breslin is good too, she plays her character very much the same as in "The Ultimate Gift", except this movie is actually good. The other interesting thing is that the film really tries to help you understand the elements of food. It goes into intricate details to describe various foods. The story tries it best to really incorporate the foods. Not to mention the music, the music in this flick was very fancy-frenchish too, kinda reminded me of "Ratatouille" and really fits in well. Because this film isn't the most actiony or expensive you wouldn't expect the most original music, but there was some really good stuff in there. The story is not the most original or complex, yet it is still very sweet and fun. As short of a review as this is thats all I can really tell you. I say its worth a multiple watches. Pick it up.

		<fullReview>No Reservation was based on the Gernan Movie Mostly Martha which was a delight.You would expect a film adaptation starring the beautiful Catherine Zeta Jones, &amp; Aaron Eckatt &amp; featuring the Little girl who brightened up Little Miss Sunshine, to be at least enjoyable.OH what a mistake this film is. This was supposed to be a romantic comedy with some serious moments. It is NOT romantic, it is not funny either.Both leads are chefs in a very high priced restaurant, The food plates look delicious. I wish the film was as enjoyable.Please do not get me wrong, it is not that bad a movie, it just not what was said about it. There is very little chemistry between the 2 leads &amp; young Miss Breslin is no where as convincing as she was in her debut film.

Hard-driven, emotionally shaky career woman inherits young child from deceased relative and now must learn to be normal like the rest of us. She might even find love and lose her hard edges and blah blah blah. . .Well, you get the idea. As soon as Aaron Eckhart shows up as the free-spirited, unshaven, opera singing (the ubiquitous "Nessun Dorma" for the umpteenth time) new cook in Catherine Zeta Jones's kitchen, we pretty much know how it will all end, plus or minus a marriage or some other joint venture.We fast-forwarded through some of the draggier moments, so for all we know it might have turned into a fast-paced thriller or a nice ambiguous study in abnormal psychology toward the end.

		<shortDescription>A slice of romantic drama gone awry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catherine Zeta-Jones is Kate, a perfectionist head chef obsessed with her work. When her sister tragically passes away and leaves her with a child to raise (played by Abigail Breslin), and her new sous-chef (Aaron Eckhart) threatens to take over her perfectly managed kitchen with his exuberance and free spirit, she struggles to adjust, but soon realises not everything in life can be handled as expertly as roast quail.I found Catherine Zeta-Jones monotonous and irritating in this movie. She seemed to have only ONE voice throughout the whole film, she showed no emotion, even in the most serious scenes. Aaron Eckhart makes up for her, but does not manage to save the film. His character was seriously underdeveloped - apart from liking opera the audience was told nothing about him. However he and Zeta-Jones did have an impressive subtle chemistry. Abigail Breslin as Zoe, was mediocre. Her brother Spencer Breslin was never interesting to me and she is pretty much the same. Also I didn't find her believable enough as a girl grieving for her deceased mother.Overall, 'No Reservations' is a pretty bland dish, despite being cooked in a smart kitchen. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant movie, American re-make of 'Bella Martha' (2001).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I watched the movie, it had a familiar feel to it. Then I remembered the 2001 German movie 'Bella Martha' (American title 'Mostly Martha') was made from the same screenplay. Both are pretty much the same movie with a few differences.Here we have Catherine Zeta-Jones as Kate, the all too serious chef, but one of the best in New York. As in the other movie, her sister is driving to visit her but dies in a car accident, and the young daughter survives. Suddenly forced into child care, Kate doesn't cope very well and takes some time off. Because of that and a pregnant cook, a new Italian-trained chef is hired. Aaron Eckhart is the chef, Nick, and Kate is angry that she was not consulted first.Abigail Breslin is good as the young niece, Zoe, who now is under the care of Kate. Patricia Clarkson is good as Paula, the owner of the restaurant. And, Bob Balaban is good as the Therapist that Kate is required by her boss to see.While mostly predictable, it is an entertaining movie about different personalities and how they become able to get along.SPOILERS: Unlike the other movie, Zoe does not run off to find her dad. But Kate does quit her job after sticking the raw steak into the table of a customer who complained that it wasn't rare enough. Then she convinces Nick not to take the job in San Francisco, and the three of them (Kate, Nick, and Zoe) open their own little sidewalk Italian cafe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant Enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kate (Z-J) is a tough, top chef at an upscale restaurant and her life gets turned upside down by suddenly having to care for her niece , Zoe (Breslin) and by the restaurant hiring another top chef (Eckhart). Oh, oh!Well, it was pleasant enough, no one was killed, shot, or stabbed and there were no car chases or explosions. Now this isn't a bad thing. It's not easy to find this kind of movie anymore, especially when the performances are first rate. I would say it was sort of a romantic comedy without too much romance or comedy. There were attempts at romance, but no one really cared. And, there were a few comedic moments, but to describe them would lose the moment. You had to be there. We kind of liked Kate the way she was even with caring for Zoe and dealing with Nick (Eckhart). Don't ask me why. Well, okay, Catherine Zeta-Jones is a very good actress, beautiful too, and I am mesmerized when she is on the screen. Also, I didn't find Nick to be the guy. He was pleasant enough, but not the guy for our Kate. Don't ask me why. Okay, okay, maybe it was because I felt he never shaved during the whole movie and looked like he might have used a Face Flobee to get the facial hairs to be the exact same size every day for days on end. Very distracting. He wasn't the guy. He was pleasant enough, just not the guy. There was nothing intense about anything, kind of smooth all the way through, but I did enjoy watching Kate work her way through caring for a child who just lost her mother and her relationship with Nick, the new chef. Catherine Zeta-Jones is very good actress, and beautiful too. Did I mention that before? Also it was enjoyable watching Ms Breslin show more range without being given a lot of lines. One day there will be a showdown between Ms Breslin and Dakota Fanning. Count on it. Both are great. As I said, it was pleasant enough, and the rest of the cast performed exceptionally well.

		<fullReview>A master chef, Kate, lives her life like she runs the kitchen at upscale 22 Bleecker Restaurant in Manhattan--with a no-nonsense intensity that both captivates and intimidates everyone around her. With breathtaking precision, she powers through each hectic shift, coordinating hundreds of meals, preparing delicate sauces, seasoning and simmering each dish to absolute perfection.I really was looking forward to this. I really wanted to like the film but this movie falls short. First of all, the film is a bit fast paced from the beginning. A lot of things happen in the first fifteen minutes of the film. After that, you get your usual romantic comedy, without a lot of laughs. However, I was destined to love this film.I was surprised by the overall dramatic tone throughout the film. It was more or less a depressing film with some sentimental sweetness and some sappy scenes. The cinematography is excellent! It really adds some depth into the movie. I also love the score of the film, although they did overkill a song by playing it every five minutes.I knew before watching this film that it would be predictable and I was right. It was predictable and I wished the film could've been a lot better if there wasn't a predictable tone throughout the film. This is weird, since I usually don't mind if a film is predictable, depending on what the film is. But I think I was expecting a lot more in this movie.The performances are strong, especially by Catherine Zeta-Jones. Aaron Eckhart and Abigail Breslin themselves are not too bad, either. In the end, you get what you expect. However, the film is extremely sweet and hard not to like but very forgettable in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why do we have to give low rating to a film just because it has not startled us with something disturbing or surreal? La Finestra di Fronte got much higher rating than this, but I think the director of that movie was not so much oriented as Scott Hicks in No Reservations. I have not seen Bella Martha, so I can't compare. But this one is independently a good romantic movie, with fine touches that show you simple facts that perhaps you do notice, but deny for the sake of your ego.Catherine Zeta-Jones was the perfect choice for this role. Just looking at her lips and her eyes, and how she smells the aroma of Saffron Sauce can make you re-live your memorable moments of passion all over again. This movie is not suitable for the American audience. It would be a much better success in those small countries where life is not about Blackberry, XBOX, parking tickets, hard scheduled dates, raises and mergers, but about blue skies, clear clouds, fresh milk and wild flowers at breakfast table. Yes, the movie does not take place in a 'urbs like that, but when you enter the kitchen of an exotic restaurant, you live the outside world behind. It is a new world within a world. To appreciate that world, you need to have different values.Exotic food has an intimate bond with exotic music, especially opera arias, since time immemorial. But with someone like Phillip Glass as the director and composer of soundtracks, I expected a little unorthodox numbers from the good old days along with Nissun Dorma and Piano Concerto No.5 on E flat major. Nonetheless, this movie keeps you entertained for every single minute without boring or stressing you for even a moment. It melts in your mouth like the finest quality Creme Fraiche.</fullReview>

One day her sister and niece Zoe are coming to pay her a visit, when her sister is killed in an accident. Therefore Armstrong is left to take care of Zoe. Kate is forced by her boss to take a week off, and upon her return, Kate discovers a new chef named Nicholas Palmer has been hired to work with her. Nick has a different personality then Kate, and an open perspective on life. Throughout the movie, Kate works through the difficulty of work, her relationship with Nick, as well taking care of her niece. I overall rate this movie a 6 to 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

Granted it is a love story and predictable, yet their interaction was fresh and thus authentic. Often such movies contain bloated characters for Reader's Digest or a soup commercial; but look at the cast in this one! Yes there are classic themes in this one but I do not think that these take away from this piece. I would say that the title may have been more catchy to the public as just "Reservations." Perhaps the cinematography is the weakest in this movie I still believe it warrants more attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm truly disappointed with "No Reservations" since it looks like one of those films where you can have a delightful and nice moment, spend some good time in front of a screen and enjoy it in a weekend afternoon. But the story of two chefs (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhart) trying to solve their differences on the same restaurant kitchen, but really together helping the woman's niece (Abigail Breslin) she got to raise after the kid's mother death in accident seemed forced, contrived and uninteresting. It's not funny, it's not romantic, it's just a silly drama that got lost somewhere. Watching the food prepared but these two chefs was nice, beautiful to see but I prefer to cook my own instead of watching something that makes me bored, hungry and twisting my nerves. This movie doesn't have a good recipe and it ends up burned on the stove of weak films. The problems with it is a screenplay without ambition, lack of animosity between everyone involved, tasteless drama and a boring comedy with no laughs, uninteresting characters. It's a epic fail to select to control this a director who does not have timing, experience or empathy with romantic comedies, instead he created a movie that didn't had to be made, there's nothing valuable here. Scott Hicks, the director is a man of one big great film and that is "Shine". This can get an easy 10 stars, A+, but some of his other works after his Oscar nomination seems to fall to pieces (although "Hearts in Atlantis" has a great potential and fantastic performances).Eckhart tried so hard to be funny, was effective at certain parts but wasn't enough to make this film funnier. Catherine has lots of appeal but stays with an average performance. Little Miss Sunshine Breslin doesn't have a great role since her Oscar nominated performance and her character here is unbearable, only losing the award of most annoying to Patricia Clarkson, very dead on scene as Catherine's boss.Cooking your least favorite meal in your house is more fun than this movie. Crying while cutting an onion is ten times more fun than this movie. It really bores to death. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will try at my best effort to be reserve on inserting negative comments for the culinary dramedy "No Reservations". However, I will not completely stuff it with tasty positivo reviews neither. "No Reservations" stars the delicious Catherine Zeta-Jones as Kate, an OCD demanding top head chef in New York who is suddenly confronted with a real life order she has never cooked up before; caring for her orphan niece whose mother passed away in a car accident. Little Miss Sunshine herself, Abigail Breslin, plays the orphan niece Zoe. To add more uncontrollable spices to Kate's life, she also is derailed in her cooking &amp; romantic world in the form of Nick; a chirpy Italian-loving chef who adds seasoning to Kate's humdrum life mixed in with a few overcooked quarrels of course. Director Scott Hicks does manage to not overdo "No Reservations" with sappy thematic elements, so I have no reservations on that note. However, I do have a few reservations on the unnecessary therapy sessions Kate has with her shrink which did not feed the film right, and also Carol Fuchs' formulaic screenplay which "desserted" the pie of creativity. "No Reservations" was Zeta-Jones' showcase and she was able to cook up some admirable acting chops in her lead performance. The charismatic Aaron Eckhart added a comedic soufflé as the sharp-wit Nick. Abigail Breslin as the grieving niece proved that this little miss actress is on her way to being the main course of child acting. "No Reservations" did entertain my cinematic taste buds, but somehow it did not leave me hungry for more. *** Average</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a cooking romance, this movie is surprisingly... cold. The characters didn't engage me. The child actress was annoying. The storyline was choppy. For a movie to succeed I think its very important for the audience to be drawn into the story and empathize with the characters. Unfortunately this never happens in "No Reservations". There is hardly any character development. Zeta-Jones and Eckhart are fine actors but definitely not in this movie. They have chemistry but since there is no basis for this chemistry, it falls flat on its face. I mean how bad can a movie be if one finds oneself liking the psychologist instead of all the dazzling main actors?? Do yourself a favor, avoid this movie and go see some of their finer ones.</fullReview>

Subtitles and all, you'll thank me.Hey Aaron and Catherine, please don't take this as a criticism, more as a wish, I wish you could recreate the 2001 version. So sorry you could not.Appreciate the cutesy effort though.UTP in Montréal.:)</fullReview>

He has not come out of a cardboard box, standard issue and all glossed. The dimple in his chin is a little too deep and his hair is a little wild but it only adds to his semi-rugged good looks. I imagine he does for the ladies what she does for the men. The real delight comes from their abilities and chemistry. Abigail Breslin has a melt you in a minute factor. The three of them make the perfect trio of contrast in this fairytale. I said this was a chick-flick, it is, but for those guys who get dragged along there is enough humor to make the marathon only a mile. I was surprised at how much insight it offered. We go into a restaurant and sometimes get a little annoyed at the delay. She talks about coordinating 40 dishes at once, when was the last time you pondered that? I think this movie might spark interest in cooking for some who may never have thought of it beyond a chore. Back to Aaron for a moment, isn't he versatile? This movie is just for fun and what's wrong with that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No Reservations is a "dramady"- a dramatic story with a few comedic touches, hence the make-believe genre. The movie, which is lightheartedly fun, handles itself well. It follows a temperamental cook named Kate, (Zeta-Jones) and her struggle to cope with loosing her sister in a car crash. Her sister is survived by her daughter Zoe (Breslin), so naturally Kate mothers her. Kate, being the controlling and bossy cook that she is, abuses her powers so her boss brings in a new cook, Nick (played by Eckhart). They fight, they get together, etc. It's cute, I assume, but not quite all that interesting. The best parts of the movie are the scenes in the kitchen of the restaurant, where all the drama and arguments are happening.You'll enjoy No Reservations if you like the topic of food cooking and the struggles of raising a child. It's not quite my cup of tea, but I thought it was fine for what it was.Good) Zeta-Jones does well, setting of restaurant is intriguing Bad) doesn't venture too far into the creative department, ending rushed</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I certainly have MY Reservations...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer sparked some interest with me. A sob story that turns warm and fuzzy with zippy little comedy lines along the way - or so I thought. No Reservations opens: Kate is a chef and a damn good one, so scrupulous and intense in her career that she finds herself ordered to visit a therapist by none other than her boss. Thus, it becomes the clichéd tale of a career woman's world turned topsy turvy by a death resulting in her becoming the guardian of a young child. Similar to Raising Helen - and can I also point out that the poor little bereaved child in it was also Abigail Breslin.I have to admit I found the film a tad dull. I almost laughed at the dreary piano tune in the background, it was almost satirical. It felt a little lifeless, even Catherine wasn't looking her usual radiant self.Yes, it was sad when Zoe realised her mother was dead, when she looked at photographs or watched videos and tears welled in her eyes - I probably would have cried had I not been in the cinema! However, there wasn't enough to lift our spirits in the rest of the film - and I feel this is what Hicks wanted to achieve. The genre title is romantic comedy but the film genre feels confused.Acting is not really an issue here. I find it difficult to question casting because I find it difficult to feel any real passion for this film. One thing it did achieve was to make me hungry watching the countless mouth watering dishes served.I enjoyed Kate's reactions to customers which hassled her - something positive I can say. I feel a lot was missing though, there seemed to be a lot of little stories within that were never really fully told. It was as if there were little consequences for actions - which made it unconvincing.To conclude, a slightly dull - somewhat watchable romantic drama that could probably have been lifted with a better soundtrack and needed a little more comedy to fit into the romcom genre. It's received split views so go, see it for yourself - however, expect something a little different than you see in the trailer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that is more than ready to be served</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good film that is ready to be served on a plate,No Reservations is about a chef,Kate Armstrong(Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is undergoing psychological therapy at her boss's insistence and that her sister recently died in an accident(presumably a car crash) meaning that Kate has to take care of her niece Zoe(another great role from Abigail Breslin). Then a new hotshot chef,Nicolas Palmer(Aaron Eckhart) arrives on the scene only for Kate to initially shun him.It is a cleverly crafted romantic drama with a bit of comedy thrown in to heat things up because in my view,this isn't your typical romantic movie and as such would be a great contender at the Golden Globes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie over the weekend and I'd say it was among the best movies I've seen this year. No car crashes, no explosions, no pretentious annoying heroes, no half-baked two-dimensional villains, and no computer graphics. Just a simple coherent plot with a few relatively normal characters with whom you would not mind spending an hour or two on a Sunday afternoon. The acting is good and it has a fairly nice soundtrack, especially if you like operatic tenors (by the way, why doesn't IMDb do a better job with soundtrack listings, missing here entirely, for example). It may not be profound, but it doesn't have a nasty bone in its body. You could do considerably worse at the megaplex.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very sweet movie. Has a great screen play. You must watch this movie with your girlfriend with your hands in hers. Though Jones plays this role a bit slowed down and without much make up she does look beautiful in some scenes. The climax scene where she brings in a raw meat piece and pierces it on a guests table and asks is this rare enough is the most amazing scene in the movie asking for applause from audience.The character that Catherina Zeta Jones plays does not bring any pity though the kid does bring a lot of pity, losing her mother and then trying to get along with a semi brat Jones.The kid has acted very wonderfully and so has Aaron Eckhart. This movie ran in select theaters in my region and pulled in a lot of crowd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I went to the movies and settled on No Reservations. I figured it would be a movie that would struggle to hold my attention. I was surprisingly impressed with the film. It was refreshing to watch a "chick flick" movie that did not depict men in a negative light. Not only did I find the story lines to be interesting I was also pleasantly surprised by the lack of foul language. The PG rating was accurate for this movie. The only questionable content I found for a PG rating was the one showing the stars engaging in a passionate kiss. However, with today's ratings standards of allowing nudity in PG-13 movies much can not be said about that scene. I recommend this movie for any couple who enjoy romantic family films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only way we Homer Simpson types will ever be able to spend an evening with someone like Catherine Zeta-Jones is through the magic of cinema. If you want an example of a truly impressive woman, go see this movie. My wife dragged me to No Reservations, but from the moment Ms. Jones appeared on screen, I knew which side had won the battle between the sexes. We men either go away completely dumbfounded that any female could have that many wiles at their beck and call, as I did, or you will be suffering existentially, wondering why you know no one anywhere near that talented and captivating.Really, I have my favorites as to actresses, but in this simple little film, Ms. Jones has completely wiped out my list. She has outdone every woman actress I have ever seen, bar none. I'm astounded because I can believe that this woman has gone through life, real life, like some otherworldly creature, able to entice any man she chooses, at will. Don't get me wrong. She's not playing an enchantress here. She's a New York chef who loves her work a little too much. But any guy who loves women will feel her unbelievable power right through the particulars of her role and the story.But that's hardly the only treat awaiting anyone yet to see this film. Aaron Eckhart, who was unforgettable in Thank You for Smoking, and Abigail Breslin, who I thought was overrated in Little Miss Sunshine, both do the kind of work awards are made for. Ms. Breslin in particular shows why the Academy may have given her an award for the wrong movie. No, I've no idea how any group of intelligent movie lovers could possibly give this practically perfect time at the movies anything less than 8 stars. Forget analyzing the story or much else in this little masterpiece. Just go and see what real talent can do. The stars do come into alignment once in awhile!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pre-cooked fair we've had before, but still manages to be entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No Reservation, although an entertaining film does not have the slightest trace of originality unlike the many gourmet dishes Kate cooks up. It follows the formula or outline of most romantic comedies so closely it feels pre-packaged and almost every scene is entirely predictable. It follows as story of a famous chef Kate, played by the always-stunning Catherine Zeta-Jones, who's sister has just dies in a car accident, forcing Kate to take in her sister's only daughter, Zoe (played by Oscar nominee Abigail Breslin). While taking time off to deal with the loss and adjust to having a child at home, a new chef, Nick (Played by Aaron Ekhart) is hired by the restaurant. Once Kate returns to work she feels threatened by the new chef, thinking he is trying to take over her kitchen and career. As the two work together they find themselves falling for each other. The cast does a fine job, Catherine Zeta-Jones sensually sophisticated, Aaron Ekhart well I have to admit I felt he was sort of picked because of his perfect "model" features but he still does a fine job. Abigail Breslin does a wonderful job reminding us why she received that nomination at such a young age. The main problem with this film was its' script. I thought the characters weren't developed quite enough. It almost seemed as an outline example for romantic comedies. As I watched the final scene I smirked having already figured it out a long time ago. One thing that helps partially salvage this movie is the pure fascinating culinary imagery, and despite all the negativity in this review it is still a moderately entertaining film for when you want something simple, brainless, and light. It does deliver some fresh laughs and let's face it Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Ekhart?need I say more?I mean talk about hot couples!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Predictable but Palatable Little Cinematic Dish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Legend of Zorro" starlet Catherine Zeta-Jones and "Erin Brockovich's" leading man Aaron Eckhart cook up a predictable but palatable little cinematic dish in director Scott Hicks' "No Reservations," a savory rehash of German director Sandra Nettelbeck's 2001 movie "Mostly Martha." Interestingly, like the recent Disney movie "Ratatouille," this cute chick flick focuses on what occurs when an outsider invades the kitchen of a renowned chef and turns her life upside down. Unlike the Disney cartoon, however, this romantic-comedy focuses on love and human relationships at large and shuns outlandish special effects. Moreover, "No Reservations" provides a welcome relief from the glut of juvenile minded summer time action thrillers. Audiences that appreciate genuine human sentiments will find a lot to delight themselves in this neatly served up 105-minute melodrama.Kate Armstrong (Catherine Zeta-Jones of "Chicago") lives only to cook and works as the chief chef at a ritzy Greenwich Village corner restaurant in Manhattan where she is a god of sorts to those who worship her culinary skills. Unfortunately, Kate's sympathetic but business-oriented boss Paula (Patricia Clarkson of "The Green Mile") thinks that her control freak chef needs to calm down and cool off in therapy because she loses her grip on reality when customers complain about the food. Reluctantly, Kate yields to Paula's suggestion and schedules appointments with a mousy psychologist (Bob Balaban of "Gosford Park") where she speaks about things in general and cooks tasty food for him. During these sessions, she reveals that she has man trouble. In other words, after she takes up with a guy and moves in with him, he usually dumps her and she is left all alone. As a result, she has little to do with men, or anybody else as far as that goes. At one point, lonely Kate bemoans her fate: "I wish there was a cookbook for life, with recipes telling us exactly what to do." Two things happen early on that sabotage Kate's orderly life. First, her sister dies in an off-screen auto accident, but her 9-year old daughter Zoe (Abigail Breslin of "Little Miss Sunshine") survives. Since Zoe has nowhere to live, Aunt Kate takes her in reluctantly and acts as her guardian. Naturally, the two suffer through their share of heartaches before they become acclimated to each other. For a while, Zoe lingers on the past, staring longingly at a photo scrapbook and videos that her mother left her. Kate, who hasn't a clue about how to raise a child, struggles desperately with her new predicament. Zoe refuses to eat anything that Kate fixes, and Paula tells Kate to take a little time off to brush up on her new parenting duties. When Kate returns to work, she discovers that Paula has gone behind her back and hired a shaggy-haired, free-spirited, blond chef, Nick (charismatic Aaron Eckhart of "Thank You For Smoking"), who wears pajama pants to work and lightens up the stuffy atmosphere in Kate's tightly-run kitchen by singing to Italian opera music on his compact disc player.Initially, these two chefs lock horns. Kate specializes in French fare, while Nick has a knack for cooking Italian cuisine. She thinks that he is trying to encroach on her kingdom. Eventually, she relents when Nick assures her that he didn't take the job to replace her. Instead, he wants to learn from her. Later, Kate notices that Zoe likes Nick. Kate, it seems, cannot find a decent enough baby-sitter, so she brings Zoe to work with her at nights. One evening she watches in surprise as Nick persuades finicky Zoe to eat a bowl of spaghetti. Previously, Kate had designed sumptuous feasts that any adult would die for but that Zoe would turn her nose up at in quiet polite disgust. Predictably, before long, Kate and Nick begin to see each other, much to Zoe's delight. Inevitably, after a number of candle-lit dinners and romantic evenings, Kate and Nick fight and break up. Nevertheless, these two cannot stay apart for long, despite their disagreements about what constitutes a good meal, because match-making Zoe won't let them.Director Scott Hicks, who helmed "Shine," "Snow Falling on Cedars," and the Stephen King thriller "Hearts in Atlantis," rarely lets gritty reality intrude on this superficial but sweetly sentimental saga. The setting of "No Reservations" is a New York City that exists only as a fairy tale in either the films of Woody Allen or in "You've Got Mail." Although tragedy brings Kate and Zoe together, Hicks doesn't linger on anything depressing. Although it is difficult to imagine her as love-lorn, Catherine Zeta-Jones is every bit convincing as the perfectionist chef who even scours the food markets to get items to make her dishes unique. If anything, Kate resembles a fairy tale character, confined into her kitchen, and awaiting a Prince Charming, who arrives in the person of charming Nick, to rescue her. "No Reservations" owes much of its believability to the sparkling chemistry between Jones and Eckhart. Reportedly, celebrity chef Michael White gave the leads some pointers about cooking. Everything about "No Reservations" is a neat, sweet feast for the eyes, the ears, and the taste buds. Amorous couples looking for dinner and a movie might want to reverse their priorities and watch this treat first before they treat themselves afterward.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"No Reservations" is like a puppy begging for your attention. Sometimes it's cute and charming, and other times you just want to push it away.(Plot summary follows in next three paragraphs - might have spoilers)The movie has more plot than it knows what to do with, and it's all predictable. It starts with Kate (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a renowned chef at an upscale Manhattan restaurant. The movie's opening scenes take great pains to make us see what a control freak Kate is, to the point that you wish you could slip her a Valium.It's quickly obvious that the movie's point is to get Kate to slow down and smell the roses. It does this by briefly showing us Kate's single-mom sister and then killing her off in a car accident, leaving behind Kate's niece Zoe (Abigail Breslin), who of course is now lost without her mother.As if that wasn't enough, the restaurant owner decides to hire another chef, a bon vivant named Nick (Aaron Eckhart), as a partner for Kate. Whereas Kate runs her kitchen by-the-book, Nick plays and sings opera for the kitchen staff while he's cooking. Gee, d'ya think all of this might work upon Kate's reserves and, ya know, lighten her up a little? If ever there was a movie that needed its actors' charm to get the story across, here it is. In particular, Nick is the most hopelessly written character in the film. He's nothing but smiles, songs, and slickness. And you don't believe for a minute that he has anything resembling a real past. His sole point of existence is to remove the bug that is so firmly implanted in Kate's curvy posterior. That Aaron Eckhart sells him to us with seemingly no effort is a tribute to his acting.Catherine Zeta-Jones' sales job isn't quite so smooth. We're meant to see that Kate is so frosty because she's been hurt a lot in life, but in the end, all we really get is Kate's prickliness -- particularly when the movie's climax brings back Kate's coldness just when we thought it had been safely tucked away.The movie's lucky charm is Abigail Breslin. Zoe talks smart, but unlike most movies with wisecracking kids, the movie makes you believe it's because Zoe is intelligent and gets right to the heart of things. Breslin was pretty good in the equally contrived "Little Miss Sunshine," but here, she's the 11-year-old motor that keeps things running; without her, the movie's contrivances would be even more threadbare than they are.There's nothing wrong with a movie that has familiar destinations; the dealmaker is how novel the movie is in getting there. As a "weeper," I mildly recommend "No Reservations" -- but not without reservations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I adore Catherine Zeta-Jones. Abigail Breslin became one of my all-time favorite child actors when I saw Little Miss Sunshine last year. I love Aaron Eckhart's wit and charisma. I even love Bob Balaban, a member of Christopher Guest's mockumentary posse. Unfortunately, I did NOT love the watery stew in which they were all floating about, No Reservations. The plot is a formulaic hodgepodge of scenes that I imagine are supposed to press your emotional buttons. Unfortunately, the only emotions they managed to elicit from my companions and me were shock at the unoriginality of the story and amusement at the cheesiness of it all. The movie went beyond being overly predictable and saccharine, though. Remember that part in the movie's preview where Kate (Catherine Zeta-Jones) slices the list of the restaurant's main dishes in half and gives one of the pieces of the paper to Aaron Eckhart's character, telling him he will be in charge of those entrées and she will take care of the rest? I think the scriptwriters might have made a similar arrangement--except one of them forgot to turn in their portions. Some scenes seemed to be missing entire chunks, which made for choppy, unnatural, almost comical progressions of what were supposed to be dramatic events. Also, much as I love CZJ, the fact that she kept slipping into her native Welsh accent made her character even less believable. I know that she can maintain a near-perfect American accent because she did so in Chicago, which further leads me to suppose that No Reservations was microwaved when it should have been slow-cooked in the oven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this to be a decent movie but not worth the money it cost to see it. Let's face it... watching a young girl grieve a lost parent is a downer and this movie focused too much on that angle. I thought there was a great deal more potential in watching the truly interesting interaction between the chefs. That was the true draw of the movie. The rest caused me to notice the tiles on the walls and ceiling of the theater. The whole idea of the movie had a great deal of potential and I hope that at some point, someone will remake this movie focusing on one aspect instead of two. That is the real problem with this movie, it has two focal points.. the loss of a parent and the comedic interaction of two really good actors. This is not like a Reece's Peanut Butter Cup, two great stories that don't go well together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate films like this that aren't what they are supposed to be. We wanted a romantic comedy and this was billed as one. It isn't. Firstly the film shows a different approach to "comedy" - it has no funny lines, and no funny situations. Secondly I fail to see why if you are setting out to make a romantic comedy you have to include a death in a film, and the obvious impact on the child casts a pall over the rest of the movie.If I wanted to watch a film about bereavement, I'd have selected something from the "Films about Bereavement" section.Thirdly there was little or no chemistry or romance between the leads. So really this Film should have more accurately been billed as a "blank, blank" Film, but perhaps that wouldn't have sold as well? Another thought - in sports players who break the rules face suspensions or fines, Why don't they bring in the same system for movies? whoever wrote this rubbish could then be suspended (3 months, 6 months?)or perhaps have points on his licence like for driving offences so in future you can look at a film this, and see it billed as a romantic comedy....by a man with 6 points on his licence for producing previous garbage!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this stuff, situations where you have copies of movies: remakes, many sequels, "homages." That way you can transcend certain weaknesses of a project. Its because when you come to a film cold, the context is merely the universe of other films which is to say the stories we use in imagining our lives. When its a remake like this, that context collapses to the previous film and what we see are the differences. In intelligent subsequents, these extend and annotate. In dumb ones like this they reinvent.The original film depended on you knowing that it was a film made by Germans about German limitations. German thought is mechanical, constrained, learned. German food is as well, even when using the styles from elsewhere. So a well-regimented, obsessive kitchen is a great cinematic metaphor for the world in which our heroine is captured. When we see her prison, we see the emotional prison Germans consider themselves in. So it matters that the interloper is Italian, essentially a lower body emotional intuitive. And it matters that the regime of the kitchen is suffused with music.It even matters that the music is opera, that one thing that remains from Italian art that can be said to be both emotionally deep (embodied) and strictly ? oh so strictly ? ordered. The original, therefore, mattered. It worked. It touched, avoiding the limits of the traditional romantic story. Its all about transcending constraints. Incidentally, in touching this, the original understood female stereotypes better, including the use of the redhead shorthand.It mattered that the original included the father and his social standing.I've never been impressed by Zeta-Jones as an actress, though her entertainment gig in "Chicago" was impressive. Here, she is photographed to her disadvantage. The poster for the film understood her one charming pose. It doesn't appear in the film, and her face is lit as an object in the environment rather than the focus it normally would be.That environmental perspective is where this film is superior to the original for me. Where nearly all the values are watered down to satisfy an apparently unsophisticated American market, the movement and order of the kitchen are better delivered here than in the original. The food is more immediately succulent. The smells, flames, tastes, are closer. The score helps.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: No Reservations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No Reservations is a remake of Bella Martha (Mostly Martha), a German movie made way back in 2001. The premise is entirely the same, and I thought the local distributors were sly enough to hold back the release of this movie to coincide during the time of the local premiere of Ratatouille. I suspect it's to rub off the Pixar animated movie's successful telling of a story set within a kitchen, to orientate moviegoers to the various roles and functions within the restaurant kitchen, so that we're all ready for this when we're in the mood for some love.And the food is absolutely to die for in this movie too. As with Bella Martha and Ratatouille, you'll just drool at the gastronomical delights that are whipped up for the movie, so the warning I give will be, don't watch this on an empty stomach, and you'll probably emerge from the theatre hall wanting to dine in a restaurant than your nearest hawker centre or food court.For those who have watched Bella Martha (as I had in doing my homework), then this movie isn't any different for the most parts. In summary, it's a story about a workaholic chef Kate (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who has to juggle to changes to her life when her boss makes her go for therapy to control that anger inside her. The first is to take care of her niece Zoe (Abigail Breslin from Little Miss Sunshine) when her sister meets with an accident, and the other is to manage that threat from work, in the form of another chef Nick (Aaron Eckhart), who has the potential to run his own kitchen, but for some reason chose to work under Kate in the same restaurant.As a romantic comedy, this movie works, well, because it adapted almost every romantic scene from the German movie. Key scenes are recreated, and for those who have watched the original, you'll recognize them in a jiffy. But No Reservations still stands on its own, thanks to its wonderful cast. Zeta-Jones is as beautifully luminous as always, and I thought she hadn't aged a bit since the first I saw her back in Mask of Zorro. She brings about a tough as nails, no nonsense attitude to her role as Kate, yet is also the vulnerable soul looking for love. If compared to the original character, no doubt Zeta-Jones is eye-candy. Aaron Eckhart brought about a certain boyish charm to his character as compared to Sergio Castellitto in the original, but Sergio had a much mature air around him. But fans of Abigail Breslin will no doubt be glad that she did exhibit some of those boogie moves (for just a bit), and I'm glad that it's not yet another role that shoos in Dakota Fanning. Watch out Fanning, here comes Breslin!But if you're to compare Bella Martha and No Reservations, each has their superior points over the other. The Hollywood version is more polished and straight-forward, opting to rely on its good looking casts to deliver the goods, and thankfully they do, even though it had to dumb down certain plot lines, making it pacier, but it couldn't shake away its "Hollywood RomCom" look and feel. It also shrewdly adapted the soundtrack from Bella Martha as well, because the music just works perfectly with the food. The original on the other hand, had more scenes which are done subtly, and doesn't feel a need to explain every little detail in verbatim. So it has more quieter moments and the romantic connotations don't come so obviously, but brews quietly in the background. What I found slightly appalling, is that No Reservations decided to dump a sub plot altogether, one that was important in the original, probably for fear of introducing yet another character. It's mostly the same, until the last third.Those who haven't watched the original shouldn't feel too bothered about that of course, but I felt it was something a little wasted. Nonetheless No Reservations is the romance movie on offering this week, and by itself, it provides some decent entertaining fare. But do yourself that favour, go watch the original too!</fullReview>

Next, contemporary ingredients were added such as; Michael Buble, Liz Phair, Paolo Conte,&amp; Ray Gelato and combined with original music by Oscar-winning composer, Philip Glass. The end result is the perfect collection of music to compliment this traditional love story set in modern times.

Scott Hicks is a fine director, a man that really knows how cinema is made. The cinematography of this flick is simply amazing, and most amazing of everything is Catherine Zeta Jones' character,Kate.Miss Zeta Jones is a great actress, too good and overrated, and in this movie she shows her great abilities and her powerful talent in bringing on her own shoulder an entire picture.

Instead of concentrating on the two girls, it decides to concentrate mostly on the guy-girl relationship-which is pitiful. Also, zeta-zone's acting ruins the movie.She acts far worse than Abigail.But i must admit- i like the ending on this one better.Not exactly the ending,actually the direction of the chef's life.Anyway,watch it if you want(i warn you,it'll arrive on TV before you come out of the theater} but don't forget to watch Mostly Martha- that one is 'funny and romantic' too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly can't remember the last time I saw a good film on a movie theater. My latest experiences have been "Wild Hogs", "Ocean's Thirteen", "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", now "No reservations"; which is not a bad film, but like so many, is regular and pointless at times and it makes you wonder why it was done. I don't have the answer, but I do have more questions; with no answers of course: Why did Catherine Zeta-Jones do it? Why did Aaron Eckhart do it? And Abigail Breslin? And director Scott Hicks: why did he wait six years after the fantastic "Hearts in Atlantis" to do this? Is there a problem with agents? Luckily, I don't have to blame them much because, during most of the time, all of the mentioned above did a good job.At times, however, they (the actors) look tired and their expressions don't seem so real. It happened mostly with Zeta-Jones, but it also occurred to Eckhart and Breslin. Maybe they couldn't believe what they were reading; watching "No reservations" is to watch intelligent people speaking silly words and a therapist (a likable Bob Balaban) making some sense out of everything?But the therapist doesn't appear long enough.We don't have to forget that this is a remake and apparently Carol Fuchs couldn't do much with her script, taken from the old one of Sandra Nettelbeck. Sometimes when a writer takes on an old screenplay, you can sense a certain amount of freshness and originality, even if you haven't seen the original film; Carol Fuch's work is not the case.There are a small number of comedies about love and cooking I like. The one I always recall is "Simply Irresistible", because it's an irresistible movie even when it exaggerates things? This I say it because "No reservations" sticks a lot to reality, with the help of Breslin's unique charm and naturalness and her instant chemistry with Zeta-Jones, and her chemistry with Eckhart; the elements that make the film watchable. I've got to say about Eckhart; he's got a perfect way of creating completely different individuals in every film. I was revising his work and he has been part of films I have seen but I don't remember his presence in them?And tell me something about that beard in "Erin Brockovich". Here, he sings opera and jumps around in a state of eternal happiness; and he's more than contagious. The other contagious thing I forgot to mention is the food?My God! Every dish looks amazing and you will spend the whole movie wanting to eat something. But the place where they cook it is so not contagious. In a simple production design, the kitchen where most of the movie takes place appears as empty as "No reservations" itself. I didn't want a place with shining lights and special effects, I know people are making food; but I felt I needed something a bit more exciting.I haven't even said that Patricia Clarkson is in the movie; but that's because she's completely underused. Oh, and Phillip Glass' light score also has its moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful film! Fun and sad and wonderfully acted by all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.Wonderful film. Catherine Zeta great and beautiful as always. Aaron Eckhart terrific and that little Abigail Breslin who we hated in Little Miss Sunshine for which she was nominated for an academy award is simply fabulous in this movie. This kid is already an established actress. Great movie if you love to eat! Not for those under 13.. a bit too sad..Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"There is no spectacle on earth more appealing than that of a beautiful woman in the act of cooking dinner for someone she loves." Thomas WolfeRatatouille renewed my appetite for food movies, just as Babette's Feast whetted it almost 20 years ago. No Reservations reminds me that even a well-intentioned food movie can be poorly served. Yuck, it's like looking at beautifully-appointed wax fruit; Look too closely and you'll not eat it. If you do eat, you'll regret.I regret that the beautifully put together Catherine Zeta Jones as Chef Kate at a trendy eatery on Bleeker St. cannot generate half the soul a little animated rat does when he tosses a garlic in a stew. When she puts truffles in a quail sauce, it's like an inept carpenter destroying your cherry cabinet with one blow: You just know he is in the wrong profession. Granted, Zeta-Jones's Kate has the maudlin ingredient cooked right into the plot?her sister killed in an auto accident, her niece becoming her ward, the music tinkling when they look at the family photos and swelling when they do "crazy" things together to create the elusive bond.All I took away from this tear-jerking rom-com was a desire to go home and cook my favorite pasta combination; Aaron Eckhart's sous-chef Nick inspired me with his combination. But in the end, I laughed little (cooking cute is a tough assignment), was annoyed at the well-worn plot (Would Kate and Nick fall in love, she the crusty chef, he the canoodling cook?), and just wanted to get the bill and go.As you can tell, I have plenty of reservations about No Reservations. See what I mean: You knew I'd try to be critic cute with that title. What fun can it be to know what's going to happen?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really hoped that this film would not be like the others where it's another family loss and then the relative takes care of them. In other words those films were good but I didn't want the comparison and with those I don't know but it didn't really click for me. This film was brilliant on some many levels. First with the cast because Catherine Zeta Jones has yet to disappoint me when it comes to her picking films and acting in them. Abigail Breslin came from Signs to this and she is incredible. I believe she will be the next Sandra Bullock, Julia Roberts, or Joan Cusack. Aaron Eckhart now there's a cutie to the fullest. He was just incredible and so likable. This film was beautifully written and you will shed some tears so for the easy sensitive criers or for those who have "over productive tear ducts" bring tissue and a mom, dad or good friend who you would like to share this with because it was truly a delight. I recommend this movie to those who love to life, cry and watch life unfold on screen. Bring Tissues!~!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chick flick with a touch of real life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(My Synopsis) Kate (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is the master chef at the trendy 22 Bleecker Street Restaurant in Manhattan. She runs her kitchen at a rapid pace as she coordinates the making and preparing of all the fantastic meals and personally displays the food to perfection on every dish. She intimidates everyone around her, so her boss sends her to therapy. Kate hates to leave the kitchen when a customer wants to compliment her on one of her special dishes, but she is ready to leave the kitchen in a second when a customer insults her cooking. Kate's sister is killed in a car accident and her nine-year old daughter Zoe (Abigail Breslin) moves in with Kate. With all of Kate's problems, the boss hires a new chef to join the staff. Nick (Aaron Eckhart) is a rising star in his own right and could be the head chef of another restaurant, but he wants to work under Kate. Kate begins to feel threatened by Nick, because he has a different style of running the kitchen. Nick loves to listen to opera when he cooks and to make the staff laugh. With all that is going on in Kate's life, falling for a man is the last thing she was looking for. There is some kind of chemistry between Kate and Nick that can only go one way. Yet life will hit her in the head when Kate's boss offers Nick the head chef job. (My Comment) You know before going in that this is a chick flick. If anything, I wanted to see Catherine Zeta-Jones do her thing. The movie actually touches on a hard subject of what can happen in life when someone you love dies. Kate had her own life and now she is responsible for her niece Zoe. Being responsible for a child will change your life dramatically, and Kate discovers that very soon. What used to be important to Kate is not so important, and she must work very hard to build a relationship with Zoe. Yes, this is a chick flick, but it also touches real life to. I think the real star of the movie was Abigail Breslin. Abigail was able to pull off her part and make you believe that her mother had actually died. Most of the movie is light hearted and fun to watch and is very predictable. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run time 1:44, Rated PG)(6/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised to find myself enjoying what on the surface was an unpromising concoction of food and acting, a recipe that rarely satisfies.This is not just another Hollywood vehicle but a solid, story-led film with an amazingly under-stated performance from Zeta-Jones - probably the best I've ever seen from her. Undoubtedly I would not have rated this so highly were it not for her, even though I wouldn't call myself a die-hard fan.She captures the mood of the story perfectly, portraying a complex mix of emotions with subtlety and understanding, ably supported by little miss sunshine Abigail Breslin. I remain to be convinced that Eckhart was the ideal choice for the love-hate interest, but I can't deny it works.A rather odd list of indigestible songs was the only thing that really spoiled it for me. Overall, a rather heartwarming and very well made movie that should appeal to connoisseurs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this movie 3 stars - one for each main actor because I know they all tried - really tried. But they were working with a very poor script and a maudlin, predictable story. This movie could not decide what genre it wanted to be - drama, romance, comedy, tear-jerker - so it tried to be all of them - and failed. The characters were unlikable - with the exception of Abigail Breslin. But even she became annoying when uttering very un-childlike lines which were supposed to be clever or cute. CZJ's character was extremely dour and Aaron Eckhart's character was overdone in places and underdone in others. All in all, the chemistry was forced between the leads (I saw more chemistry in Ratatouille!) and it had the most irritating musical score that kept repeating itself over and over....and over. We rented this film, and when I went to get a drink I told my husband not to hit "pause" - I just wanted this disappointing movie to be over!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this film tonight, and I absolutely, without a doubt, fell in love with it. From start to finish, I must say, that Catherine Zeta-Jones &amp; Aaron Eckhart are so entirely heart-warming, their charismatic charm, their passion, their love for such similar and exquisite tastes of life. The beginning starts off very dramatic and on a very sympathetic note, to the tragedy that comes along in the beginning. It's a true, realistic, a vision of love, compassion, finding each other's flaws, making the littlest flaws which make the most perfect dishes. This has to be my favorite family film I've seen this year, next to Ratatouille. Abigail (played by the mother's sister's daughter), so entirely adorable, of how she lights up, no beams up with radiating charismatic emotion &amp; such full of heart &amp; joyous rapture. I would &amp; will recommend this film to people of all ages. In my opinion, the most heartfelt, intriguing, uniquely developed films I've seen, that's come together ever so gently &amp; genuinely, with a certain lack of a better word "original" that seems too little to comprehend such a beautiful, light-hearted, yet filled with compassion, touching subjects of life's obstacles, working together as a team, with the person you least expect coming into ones' life, even when you least expect it. I will not spoil anymore :)! It's truly that grand of a film! May all of you enjoy it as much as I have, if not even more! I hope to hear some replies!

		<fullReview>This film is about an obsessive chef clashing with a carefree chef who invades her kitchen after a horrible accident killing her sister.I watched the original Bella Martha and instantly fell in love with it. I was hoping No Reservations would have the same charm and chemistry, but unfortunately it did not.No Reservations gets Americanised a lot, including the rather pointless addition of a therapist! Unlike Bella Martha, No Reservations do not even focus on nice food, which is a great pity. The relationship of Nick and Kate is poorly built up, and I think they don't have chemistry together. Fortunately, Zoe is a likable character, and Abigail Breslin acts very well.No Reservations is still entertaining, but it is a lot less charming and enthusiastic than Bella Martha.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Catherine Zeta Jones and Aaron Eckhart had little chemistry on screen. They certainly did not look like a couple falling in love. Jones, plays Kate, a great chef but doesn't let people in and doesn't want a boyfriend. For some reason never explained, Nick a new chef at the restaurant falls for her. Why, she is mean to him. He admires her as a chef, but the whole love story is not believable. Kate's sister dies and she must raise her niece. So, this adds more complications to Kate's life, which mainly just consists of the restaurant. She was rather a boring person to center a movie around.FINAL VERDICT: Dull, not much romance for a supposedly romance film. And it's definitely not a comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Values ----- With Reservations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good natured family drama about a New York chef who inherits her best friend's daughter when the friend is killed.This movie is well acted, well photographed and is about the best kind of family drama we get from major studios these days. Catherine Zita Jones delivers all the warmth and emotion one might expect from a very decent person thrown into this kind of challenge.My problem with it is the Hollywood Liberal mindset that children ought raise the grown-ups rather than grown-ups using their maturity and experience (and moral values) to guide the young. Exactly backwards, as is Hollywood's current devotion to anti-patriotic films.I recommend the DVD as a plus in a year dominated by awful movies such as No Country for Old Men. But leave the kids outside lest they have still one more lesson in dominating spineless parents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Reservations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had not much intention of seeing this movie, but just because the star cast was a bit good ? Catherine Zeta Jones and Aaron Eckhart; and the knowledge that this could be like a light hearted romantic comedy; I set myself to go to the theatres; and also because it was a new movie released in Amsterdam.The story is about Chief Chef Kate (Catherine Zeta Jones) of a small restaurant ? who is a perfectionist, and a high skilled cook and cannot take people's ignorant comment of finding fault in her cooking. As circumstances have it her sister dies in an accident and her niece Zoe (Abiqali Breslin ? Little Miss Sunshine girl) is left in Kate's custody. A new cook Nick (Aaron Eckhart) is hired to replace Kate for a week. Nick is just the opposite of what Kate is. When Kate returns there are sparks between Nick and Kate ? but when Kate sees that her niece Zoe is developing a bond with Nick ? things turn romantic between the two. Before the end, as always there is a mis-understanding between the two and Zoe is the reason again for them to unite back.The story is totally clichéd and while watching it we know exactly what is going to happen next. The movie has its romantic moments, but it is too rosy. I am sure this movie would be loved by females, especially girls. Let me check IMDb ratings ? Yes highest rating by girls under 18 (8.2) and generally overall female rating (7.3) compared to males (6.2).My rating is much below than the average male rating, but it is not because I am not romantic or sensitive. I think the movie is something we have seen again and again and again for thousands of time. The same story line and plot! Catherine Zeta Jones and Aaron Eckhart have acted well, but the scenes are stolen by Abiqali Breslin's acting. She has delivered again constraint and realistic portrayal of a child. I hope she does not get type-casted in such type of roles.Director Scott Hicks has done an okay job. Some musical numbers are really good ? thanks to Philip Glass to give above average scores.If you have time, and nothing much to do ? this movie is no harm to watch ? much better than the current crappy crop running in Amsterdam (like Crank, 1408 etc.) (Stars 5.5 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cancel your reservations on this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"No Reservations" is the story of Kate Armstrong (Catherine Zeta-Jones), one of the best chefs in the city. Despite her culinary abilities, she sometimes has a bad temper and goes to a therapist who she tells her life to, which usually has to do with cooking food.However, Kate's food-based life changes when her sister dies in a car crash and she becomes the guardian of her sister's daughter Zoe (Abigail Breslin). Without having the experience of being a mother, or even having the experience of being with anyone but herself, challenges of mother and daughterhood arise.On top of that, Kate must also deal with a new sous-chef in the kitchen - Nick Palmer (Aaron Eckhart). Nick is an opera music-loving, funny, and charming cook, unlike the overly-serious Kate. But somehow, Nick and Kate fall in love as the movie progresses, and by the end of the movie, Nick, Kate, and Zoe become a happy family and own their own restaurant.Well who didn't see that one coming? The problem with "No Reservations" is that, despite it's cute, interesting-but-predictable premise, it moves slowly, doesn't have much pizazz and spunk for a movie taking place in a hot, city restaurant, has unnecessary scenes and subplots that could easily have been cut from the film, and seems to push interesting characters, like Nick, to the side through a lot of the running time.Also, you know that light, sad piano music that movies play when something bad happens, like the death of a loved one, or when someone seems lost in life. Well, when it's played once, it may shed a couple of tears because of the sadness. But when it's played twenty-eight times like in "No Reservations" to the point where it gets annoying, it feels like a daytime soap opera ballooned onto the big screen.However, my grandma, mom, and even my eight-year-old little sister loved this movie. They say that I, a dude, only like movies like "Transformers" and that this movie actually has "feelings." Well, if the characters weren't so boring, maybe I would've felt for them.Plus, my grandma and mom forget that I didn't even like "Transformers" either. So I think I know what I'm talking about when I say that you can just cancel you reservations on this one.So if the girls need something to escape from "Transformers," then this may be a good treat for them. Good luck to all dudes who must take their girlfriends to this snoozefest.Bonix12 rating: 2/5 Stars (4/10) and not recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That got annoying real quick.No Reservations is not a romantic comedy. I don't know why it's been marketed as one but it's not. Catherine Zeta Jones, Aaron Eckhart, and Abigail Breslin, all actors that I'm quite fond of, star in this movie that is kinda okay. What happens in the story, and these would normally be considered spoilers if it all weren't obvious from the trailers that have been out for over a month, is that Catherine Zeta Jones is an uptight chef who thinks she has her life together but it's a mess. Because of an accident she has to take in her niece. At the same time her restaurant gets a new chef, who likes opera. I'll bet you know what happens next, and what happens after that.As I said before there is next to no dialogue. Lots of scenes with loud music, opera or otherwise, where you can see the characters talking but have no idea what they're saying. If there are any good scenes they are between Eckhart and Breslin. (I noticed that he was good with kids in Thank You for Not Smoking.) But for most of the movie Jones is an automaton. I don't know if that was her attempt at grief or what, but it was so bland. It really looked like someone decided to think of romantic images of two chefs falling in love and images of a child in grief and tried to assemble them into a movie. I've only given it such a high rating because of the cast. Otherwise it took the normal romantic comedy formula and made a drama out of it.Really there's nothing new to see here. Move along.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great performance by Catherine Zeta-Jones (Kate) and Aaron Eckhart (Nick). Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhart complement each other very well, the movie doesn't feel complete until Eckhart comes in. The real prize, however, goes to Abigail Breslin who plays Zoe, Kate's niece. Abigail Breslin's facial expressions and reactions to her new environment are what makes this movie possible.*SPOILERS*Kate is a cold hearted women who's life is the kitchen at which she works in one of the city's best restaurants. When her sister unexpectedly dies she is left with her niece Zoe. To add to her misfortune her boss Paula (Patricia Clarkson) hires a new chef to help out while Kate tries to pull her life back together. Kate can't find anyway to relate to Zoe until she brings her to her kitchen where Nick has taken a firm hold of things.Nick is a laid back chef from Italy who loves listening to Opera while he works, this does not sit well with Kate as she doesn't like "distractions". To Kate's surprise Nick and Zoe bond very quickly and when Kate let's Zoe have one wish her wish is for Nick to come over so she could cook diner with him. After Nick spends the evening with Kate and Zoe an instant connection is made between them all.Instead of competing Nick and Kate work together, however after Paula offers Nick Kate's job thing's go downhill, instead of asking Kate for everything Paula starts asking Nick. The suspicious Kate confronts Nick about the situation at which point Nick reveals he's been offered Kate's job. A few more calamities later Kate quits and goes home to Zoe.Zoe hasn't seen Nick around for a while and asks Kate if there's something wrong, Kate tells Zoe Nick isn't coming back, however, she finds out later that Nick didn't accept Paula's offer. The next day Zoe is missing, and with the help of Nick she is found at her mothers grave. Nick and Kate put aside their differences and start a relationship along with a new restaurant of their own.*SPOILER'S END* No Reservations is the first movie I have seen in a long time that I can say the whole family will enjoy. It is not a "chick flick" or a kid's movie, rather a family comedy everybody can enjoy.8/10 from Mraz.</fullReview>

It is an audience-friendly film but it's also a relationship film, a food-film and a film that reminds us that change is inevitable. All the players are excellent with no one stealing the limelight. Yes, the film is reasonably predictable and that might be OK. Restaurant stories are usually very interesting and fun, this proved no exception.

But then her sister's planned visit and the arrival of a new Sous Chef Nick (Aaron Eckhart) add unexpected spice to the traditional recipe.Scott Hicks delivered, just in time, the great summer romantic comedy that is well worth dishing out the evening rate at the box office.Family viewing notes: While there is not any graphic sexual content, it is implied.

		<shortDescription>We've seen this movie before, but not usually associated with good acting...and good food...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Waitress and Ratatouille, one would think the summer movie season is complete with these down-to-Earth films focused on people and food. But, somehow and someway, we get a third flick dealing with a mesh of food and life. No Reservations is a poorly advertised film that is nothing outstanding, but its nothing repulsive either. Mediocre is too harsh a word as well; perhaps "charming" best suits this film. Clichés are the biggest bugs in the movie, marring it and preventing it from becoming something different and special. Driven by great acting but marred by a predictable plot, No Reservations is a chick flick that would also make a nice family film or an escape from the typical loud and explosive movies we usually experience over the summer. Catherine Zeta-Jones, the star propelling this picture, proves that she is more than just a pretty face and an aide to a hero as she delivers a superb performance that should create some noteworthy buzz.We shall begin by thrashing the marketing department to no end. This is not a romantic comedy; this is more like a family drama. There is very little romance, and not as much comedy as one would have hoped. Despite the light-hearted moments you see sprinkled throughout, there is a heavier dose of drama parading through. In other words, the people advertising this low-budget flick did not see the movie at all, or are totally oblivious to what they were doing. No Reservations is about an eccentric chef named Kate with a love for food but also carries a very short fuse that results in quarrels with customers. She is forced to have a therapist, and pretty much dedicated her whole life to the restaurant she dearly works for. When a tragedy strikes the family, she is forced to shift the focus of her life onto her niece, the crushed and emotionally destroyed Zoe. At the same time, a new chef named Nick starts working at the restaurant and seems to threaten Kate's placement there.On a low-budget movie like this, it's the acting and writing that must excel above everything else in order for the entire production to be bearable. The writing is a bit flawed, with enough clichés to create a drinking game and enough predictability that allows for you to draw out the next scene before it even arrives. Despite the predictability, the acting is what draws you in and prevents you from leaving the movie theater. Catherine Zeta-Jones is not only beautiful, but displays her dramatic chops and her comedic chops as the eccentric chef with a tough personality. But almost surpassing Zeta-Jones is the cute yet talented Abigail Breslin, of Little Miss Sunshine fame. Breslin's performance resembles that of Justin Henry nearly 30 years ago (lead child in Kramer vs. Kramer); cutesy, vulnerable, and very realistic. Adding to the overall charm in No Reservations is Aaron Eckhart as the lovable chef that captures the anger of Kate.The directing and cinematography makes up for the weak writing. Films focused around expensive food seem to focus more on details since we are dealing with high-quality foods and high-quality restaurants, so in order for a sense of realism to exist, you'd have to be able to smell the fine cuisine. Just like Ratatouille, No Reservations does just that, even better because its live-action. Scott Hicks, whether he meant to or not, does a superb job keeping the camera close to the subjects and giving you the feeling that you are seated at a table witnessing the events unfolding, or you are a chef witnessing Zeta-Jones' character in action.Bottom Line: Just like the structures of these reviews, No Reservations is very predictable. Not only that, but there's nothing that separates it from any other family drama, or romantic comedy, or whatever it is supposed to be. Nonetheless, the actors and actresses involved make up for it by delivering superb performances. Then we have to give kudos to the director for keeping the film simple, yet appetizing and full of flavor. If you were interested in this movie from the beginning, you pretty much know what you are getting; it's nothing totally different from the genre. If you like these kinds of movies, then you'll get a kick out of this one; then hunger afterwards. Otherwise, skip; move on, unless you want to see Zeta-Jones in a pillow fight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good date movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie. It has an amazing cast (Catherine Zeta-Jones, Aaron Eckhart and Abigail Breslin) that light up the screen. This is a must see romantic-comedy to get away from all the CGI films and other fare out there.The New York Times says; "Make no mistake: "No Reservations" is a factory-sealed romantic comedy. It embraces dark emotions in early scenes showing Kate and Zoe's grief, then moves on quickly, perhaps out of fear that viewers will deem it a downer. There's never any doubt that Nick has Kate and Zoe's best interests at heart, or that they all will find happiness on its own sweet terms.""...the emotional details of Kate, Nick and Zoe's journey are surprising, honest and life-size, and the film's determination to present their predicament sympathetically, without appealing to retrograde ideals of femininity and motherhood, makes it notable, and in some ways unique."Variety says; "All the same, Zeta-Jones is in her element as a formidable woman one messes with, professionally and personally, only at one's peril. Dominating the kitchen like a field commander, her Kate may have stringently repressed desires and emotional frustrations she refuses to confront but, then again, she may not, and imagining that the latter is the case constitutes her greatest appeal. And, yes, she looks pretty darn good in her tight-fitting work uniform.""The lanky, exuberant Eckhart might seem an odd match for his co-star's cool, dark beauty, but this mostly works to the film's benefit; thesp makes Nick's quirkiness winning rather than grating as he stealthily charms Zoe while restraining himself with Kate. Breslin again shows she's got the right stuff by playing a bereaved kid without asking for sympathy."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Run, don't walk to see NO RESERVATIONS.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just spent the most enjoyable hour and a half watching 'chef' Catherine Zeta Jones (CZJ), her male 'sous chef,' and a refreshingly talented young girl. The story is simple, the writing is excellent, the direction and pacing are perfect-with no slow spots, the lighting is exactly as it should be in each setting, and, the music is eclectic and exceptional. NO RESERVATIONS is set in a restaurant's kitchen with CZJ as the perfectionist head (and only) chef over a large team of cooks. She discovers herself through life experiences new to her. This is a 'feel good' PG movie that is a most welcome attraction at the cinema. End note: I stayed through the entire end credits just to hear some of the songs again. I shall purchase the CD, which is only the second time I've done this in recent memory. Do not deny yourself this most agreeable entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NO RESERVATIONS is an entertaining and nice summer 2007 film which gives an audience a very interesting and intelligent female lead in Cathterine Zeta-Jones as a Chef in the high profile "foodie biz" of chic New York and has the talented Aaron Eckhardt as her protagonist and romantic counterpart. Abigail Breslin in her "little grab the heart" role, shots of the village, wonderful appetizing displays of food and the glam gal, Patricia Clarkson, keeping 22 Beeker running and filled with customers. Have I mentioned that this film makes you want to pay attention the next time in your city a very pretentious and high profile restaurant opens for business? And, reservations are needed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A daily comment from Midget Emma: No Reservations (2007)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No Reservations is a nice break from all the other movies which have come out lately.This was much better than i thought it would be. When it finished i felt refreshed and had a smile on my face.The story was told so well and every character was explored. Even the characters that are not seen a lot.From the minute this starts i could tell it was going to be a emotional movie. But luckily the emotions are spread out and come at the right times.Make sure there is food close by. Because you will finish watching this and want some food.All the actors did a good performance. Catherine Zita Jones did a good job as the obsessive chef, Kate who must have everything done right. Her world is turned upside down when she has to take care of her grieving niece. Aaron Eckhart was OK as the opera singing chef, Nick who is transfered to Kate's kitchen. Although i think the opera thing was overdone. But the one who knocks everyone's performance out (like always) is Abigail Breslin. She was great as the grieving niece who moves in with her auntie.But unfortunately all movies must end and this one ends to fast. Luckily i didn't go to the toilet or i would have missed the whole ending.There are a few laughs here and there and a few emotions.I recommend this when you have had enough of those violent guy films and you want a good chick flick.A good refreshing movie.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, it was a very predictable movie..but that's not a bad thing.It was a time waster and after seeing several slasher movies prior was a nice change of pace.The restaurant kitchen scenes were too fake for me - as a partial owner or a restaurant in Downtown Vancouver, BC, I know the operations of something that is supposed to be that busy and how a kitchen operates.Not that I will get into that here. However there were many safety and health matters overlooked.However seeing his plate of pasta, it looked pretty poorly created and undercooked with no real substance to it. It looked bad. The pizza looked absolutely horrible - almost as bad as a Dominoe's pizza.If there is one thing I know how to cook, it's pizza...damn straight...after traveling across North America and Europe, I have to come across only a handful of places that serve up a good slice. Now as a sous chef as he claims to have been, his pizza dough, crust and topping are sorely lacking.With his skills in Italian cuisine, he should have been able to dress that pizza like a dream...and he did not...which means that even in New York City - where pizza is supposed to be king, the best chefs can not make a piece of pie worth $1.00 a slice.It looked undercooked, the topping were cut too large and the cheese had not properly melted...thus means once again...I am still by far a better pizza cook that even a CHEF in one of New York's finest dining restaurants...which is OK by me.Because I will never give my secret.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can we like the movie when the lead character is so unlikable?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhart star in a "romantic" drama about an uptight chef played by Zeta-Jones, who ends up carrying for her niece when her sister is killed in a car crash. While she's out taking care of family matters she's replaced by Eckhart.Unfunny maudlin tale with no chemistry between the leads (she's a dead fish and he's okay, but not much of anything). Watching this I was wondering why anyone would want to see this since Zeta-Jones' character is so unlikable. Come on she's so obsessed with cooking and being the best all she does is cook for her therapist or talk about food. Ugh. I won't use any of the numerous puns that come to mind. I couldn't finish it.</fullReview>
