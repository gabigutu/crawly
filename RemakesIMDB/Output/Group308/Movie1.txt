		<fullReview>A strange thing about the food: some of it, like the bird-cooked-in-pig's-bladder which Martha describes in loving detail in order to have something to talk about while she's with her therapist, sounds good, and perhaps even looks good, without being in the least bit appetising. You'd have to be mad to actually eat anything that's been cooked in a pig's bladder. But Martha is probably right aesthetically, if not in any other way: if she says the best way to cook the bird is in a pig's bladder, then you'd better believe it.Martha is a superb creation. She's a good chef. (She may be the best chef of any film ever made.) When her boss sends her to a therapist, she talks about food and cooking, which interest her, rather than about herself, which doesn't interest her. She goes to therapy because her boss orders her to, and when her therapist (who's no fool either) asks her why she thinks her boss orders her to, she says, as though considering the question for the first time, that she doesn't know ? and she clearly doesn't care, either.When various people (her orphaned niece, an Italian cook) come along to disrupt her life, we're on her side in wanting her to retain control; and although these likable people DO successfully disrupt her life, she does successfully retain control; so everyone wins. And it's hard not to admire someone who can not only insult the philistines who eat at the restaurant where she works but who know how to do so properly. These people don't know how good they have it. I'd rather be insulted by her than flattered by some spineless flunky.The script, word for word, and moment for moment, is as perfectly judged as one of Martha's dishes. The IMDb user who says of Lina: "She didn't cry when her mother died, but she was really upset when Martha forgot to pick her up. It wasn't her fault, it was the script's" merely shows how much his sensibilities have been coarsened by Hollywood cliché. In fact, the film shows genuine insight into the way people naturally react, not the way lazy screenwriters would like to train them to react. Lina reacts to her mother's death not with the usual screen histrionics but by not eating. Tears are reserved (as they are in life) for less important misfortunes.This is an assured, intelligent, charming film. Even the use of music shows an unerring touch. I'm eager to see what Sandra Nettelbeck does next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wiener Schnitzel Italian style...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This German film is one of the happiest surprises of the year. Not only is it a well paced, acted, and directed, but it involves the viewer like no other film in recent memory. Director/writer Sandra Nettelbeck deserves praise for bringing this joyous piece to the screen.Martina Gedleck, as Martha, is perfect as the control freak of the upscale restaurant. Obviously, she can cook, judging by the full houses and the good vibes she generates among the diners. What she has in smarts, she lacks in social graces. Obviously, she doesn't have a life.Her world is shattered by the arrival of a niece that comes to her under tragic circumstances, and from Mario, the new Italian cook. One can see the new man in her kitchen is too much of a free spirit, who ultimately will be her downfall. Mario, very nicely played by Sergio Castelletto, is the opposite of his German colleague. It doesn't take long for him to charm the daylights out of Martha. Sparks fly whenever they are on screen together. Both principals have the right chemistry and that's why this film works so well. It will surely disarm anyone in the right state of mind. The only thing is that one must leave the theatre craving for a great meal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's almost as if Nettelbeck had been given a recipe for a perfect film - start with the tried-and-tested, take a character living alone, set in his/her ways then saddle him/her with a young kid and simmer the love-hate on a low flame; add a culture clash and vamp til ready -and discarded it in favor of her own ingredients. The culinery metaphor is self-explanatory but it IS fun to see the heavy, lard-based German cuisine slugging it out with the lighter, oil-based Italian style. Up front we have two cold teutonic hearts, aunt and neice and with the introduction of the Italian extrovert chef we know it is only a matter of time til the warm Italian sun thaws the cold aryan hearts. That's pretty much what happens but it is a DELIGHT to go along for the ride and surrender your emotional taste-buds to Nettelbeck's expertise for the entire running time. I've just seen this movie for the second time in about 8 months and I was just as captivated this time around. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfectionist Becomes Unglued-Charmingly, Movingly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Sandra Nettelbeck directed a wonderful cast in an outstanding film blending drama and comedy in a setting that left me moved - and hungry."Mostly Martha" (original name "Bella Martha") revolves around wound-up-tight-as-a-burrito master chef Martha (Martina Gedeck). Responsible for the success of Lido, her boss, Frida's (Sybille Canonica) urban German restaurant, Martha must nevertheless comply with her employer's demand that she weekly see a therapist (August Zirner). Martha seems clueless as to why therapy might help her but observing her in the kitchen and with restaurant guests suggests that her boss isn't too off-base sending her to a shrink. On the other hand, this therapist seems to at sea with her. He'd really find his place in New York.Martha is Lido's proud and controlling head chef and she benevolently but firmly rules the kitchen. She's less charming with complaining customers engaging in forced and loud confrontations that I doubt even a hardened New Yorker could tolerate. Or an owner.Coming for a visit, Martha's sister is fatally injured in a car crash leaving her eight-year old daughter, Lina (Maxine Foreste), lightly injured physically but deeply grief-stricken and withdrawn. Of course what follows is Martha's attempt to care for Lina and the clashes this unanticipated and initially painful relationship inevitably spawns.Complicating matters, enter handsome chef Mario (Sergio Castellitto) who Frida hired without Martha's clearance. Professional jealousy? Fear of competition? Rude behavior? No spoilers in listing the inevitable.Films with food as a central theme often allow the potential joy of gustatory pleasures to serve as a metaphor for the possibilities of satisfying and meaningful personal relations. Sappiness is a very possible roadblock too often encountered in this genre where the saccharine isn't just on the table. Not here. Everyone in the cast is marvelous. The characters are real. It's impossible not to care about them.Especially winning is Maxine playing Lina. The nuances of her portrayal mirror without histrionics the path a bereaved little child must follow to reach acceptance and happiness. Martha, with no experience with children, goes through a believable transformation that made at least this viewer root silently for her. A woman who thinks a depressed and scared child wants haute cuisine for every meal as comfort food has a way to go. And Martha makes the trip.Please see this film. It won't show up in many places but it's bound to be in rental outlets before long.10/10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misleading trailer, Wonderful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Nothing (well very few things) irritates me more than a marketing campaign that misrepresents the movie. The trailer I saw 2 months ago, led me to believe that this was a comedy, in fact, almost a slapstick comedy. PLEASE don't go to this movie expecting a comedy. There are a few laughs, but mostly just a few smiles and chuckles. This wonderful film offers so much other than comedy. Veteran German actress Martina Gedeck is just outstanding as Martha - a beautiful woman comfortable only while cooking ... and then just barely. Most of the movie deals with Martha's struggle at being a mom to her 8 year old niece AND having to share her kitchen with a talented "Italian" chef. Watching these 3 grow is painful, yet fulfilling. Watch for the changes in Martha's approach to food and life as Mario shows her the warmth and emotions of both. This is a coming of age film for an older woman. "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" had been my favorite little movie of the year. Now it is not so little, and "Mostly Martha" may be every bit as good. Just don't expect a laugh out loud comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly Martha but all good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mostly Martha" is a thoroughly delightful tale of a comely, self contained, socially unassured, and occasionally gauche German master chef, Martha (Gedeck), in need of a recipe for living who finds love through tragedy and romance through cooking. In thinking about these comments I concluded that there is nothing I would change about this film except the language (I don't speak German). A perfect little gem, "Mostly Martha" is the kind of flick which makes you feel sorry for those who won't watch foreign films because of subtitles and wonder why audiences dine voraciously on cinematic junk food when such palate pleasers as this are not only delicious but nutritious.

		<fullReview>This enjoyable little movie is solid in all dramatic and comedy aspects. This is great entertainment with an uplifting message and a great feast for the eyes and ears. The German subtitles are hardly a problem as the storyline is universal and the expressions and acting go beyond cultural barriers to tug at the heart and mind in this wonderful cinematic treat. Chefs and lovers, people who have lost someone and those who are caught within themselves, with some inner demons can appreciate this movie that captures both the beauty and complexity of perfection and the freedom of human emotions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four relationships, two fronts, an island (no woman is....)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(spoiler regarding the general plot)Bella Martha reminds me of About A Boy, the "no man is an island" aspect of it. In some ways, Martha is like the guy played by Hugh Grant. The difference though is that while he apparently is really happy about the state of affairs, i.e. the isolation, she is not (even if she may not be fully aware of her own unhappiness). She has to visit a therapist regularly, although she claims that this is purely on instruction of her boss. I call this visit the first of the four "relationships" just to make the number sound more interesting. The other three relationship all start to develop quite early in the film. First, a neighbour moves in, a gentlemanly engineer called Sam. Then in her "office" i.e. the kitchen of a restaurant where she is the chef, a chap called Mario is brought in by her boss as temporary relief for her assistant on maternity leave. Finally, death of her single-parent sister in an accident left her taking care of her eight-year-old niece Lina while they search her father in Italy. The first half of the film developed these three relationships along the two fronts: home and office. Soon, it is clear that Sam's role is not really significant, serving just as a dependable friend and emergency-baby-sitter. On the other hand, rocky starts of the other two relationships smooth out as the two fronts merge. Lina comes to the restaurant kitchen in the evenings, becoming a darling there, while Mario becomes a family friend and Lina's buddy, and the three look just like a family. We begin to see smiles on Martha's face.As in similar movies, just after the mid-point, when characters are well developed and things go nicely, conflicts occur. What I found is that the hostility of Lina towards Martha is less than convincing, even if we take into account her possible rejection of Martha as a mother-substitution. The eventual reconciliation also comes a little too easily. The other conflicts, on which I won't go into details, are not that well developed.But that is exactly the main point. This is not a Hollywood movie with the standard formula of powerful dramatic conflicts and climatic tear-jerking conclusions. This point is well made when we see the ending of the story given to us quite casually as part of the credit roll. Oh yes, there's a concluding scene with the therapist, reminding us of the sense of humour that comes as part of the film.Smooth jazz (not sure if that's the right terminology) has been used throughout the film, at the right times, enhancing it rather than distracting from it.Finally, I really love the scenes in the kitchen which is Martha's entire universe at the beginning of the film, as well as where her reconciliation with both Mario and Lina first takes place. The story aside, I really enjoy the operation in the kitchen, which is the exact opposite to the mass production lines brought about by the industrial revolution. Here, in Martha's kitchen, things are done with what I can only describe as artistic flair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughtful, moving, rewarding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few rhetorical questions: a. Why are there no great English-language food/romance movies? Whenever you see a movie that truly ravishes you with food preparation and recipes as part of the atmosphere of the movie, it comes from France or Mexico or Hong Kong - or, if it is in English, it's borrowed culturally from another country (e.g. Chocolat, or the Mexican-American adaptation of Ang Lee's Eat Drink Man Woman). I think it's because the English speaking societies of the world have a relatively unsophisticated approach to food preparation and dining, manifest in our great contributions to world culinary arts - fast food and industrial agriculture, plus cooking technologies that take art out of the equation. You can't have a sexy drama set amidst a world of force-fed veal or microwave dinners.b. Why do we never talk about German comedy? The Germans do have a comedic tradition, but the movies that are released in the US tend to be solemn dramas, violent or shocking action pieces or grim experimental works. On the rare instances that I see a German comedy, I'm always pleasantly surprised, and I have the feeling I'm missing out. c. Why are European movies so much better than American films at showing sexiness and desirability in 30- or 40-something year-old women? I have a pet theory, that European sensibilities about marriage and commitment are sufficiently different from American norms that there is the expectation that a 35-year old woman may yet be actively and happily single, or perhaps a single mom who isn't stigmatized to feel that she had best find some sucker to marry her and get out of the dating pool.d. Why isn't jazz used in American soundtracks anymore? In this film set in Germany, the score is assembled by Manfred Eicher (founder of ECM, the acclaimed modern-jazz label), and it's all good. Some nice German lieder, classic vocal jazz, and instrumental pieces by Keith Jarrett and others. We Americans appear to have forgotten jazz as soundtrack music. In any case, Mostly Martha is a fine little movie set in contemporary Köln, starring Martina Gedeck as the title character. Martha is a neurotic, workaholic chef at a high-end restaurant, whose control freak tendencies keep her at a distance from everyone. When her boss insists that she go to therapy, she replies by preparing recipes for the hapless shrink. Both lonely and a loner (a tricky combination), she throws herself into her work to the point of exhaustion.Martha's single-minded life is thrown upside down when she suddenly becomes the guardian to her niece Lina (Maxime Foerste). As she struggles to take on this new role, the arrival of a competitor in the form of a brash Italian chef (Sergio Castellitto) threatens her supremacy in the kitchen. Any viewer of romantic comedies knows where this is going, but I have no complaints about the plot line. The performances were all good; the dialogue is thoughtful; the food looks delicious. It's not a great movie, but it's a good one and would be an admirable effort by any studio.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>exceptionally good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an excellent psychological study of a VERY controlled and emotionally constricted woman who uses food, believe it or not, as a way of avoiding intimacy. She is a superb chef who is incredibly precise and demanding concerning her cooking because she is so uncomfortable with people. However, into her tightly controlled world comes chaos in the form of her niece--whose mother was just killed in an auto accident. Not surprisingly, she has a hard time relating to this child and I was thrilled that her transformation to a whole person took time and wasn't achieved in a Hollywood-style way. Instead, this little girl (who was not overly cute or fake--thank goodness) and a new chef at her restaurant (who was completely unlike her) influence Martha in a way that is believable and satisfying.By the way, while not quite as good as The Big Night (which came out the same year) or Babette's feast, this movie is VERY reminiscent of them--elevating food to a true work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have it now. Buy, don't rent this film. It's a keeper. Most notable and with great kudos to the director, the films stays true to itself almost all the way through. Far enough to beat out most other films. There are a few quibbles toward the end of the film, but not enough to shake off the aura it imparts just giving yourself over to its story.The camera moves efficiently and cleanly throughout the film, and the actors respond with clean understated action and dialog.The story is spare, and I found what I think is a clue to the writer's intention, as the protagonist describes the menu purpose of "Fish in Butter and Basil sauce." Listen for it and see if you don't agree, she is speaking to us about her story/film.To own this is, like Nurse Betty, to own something you just have to pull out and watch a couple of times a year. just because they're so darn good.No wonder the folks in H'wood are busy at making an American version for 2007.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything "Chocolat" should have been! (Not a Spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, Mostly Martha possessed all of the ambient factors required to deliver a really good Romantic Dramedy. It was the total package, sensual, sensuous and most importantly it contained several dramatic elements that were genuinely entertaining. The film was superbly cast and directed. I was completely enchanted by Martina Gedeck's role as Martha, which was based primarily on emotional development and adult growth toward maturity. Sergio Castellitto, (Mario), was humorous passionate and seemed to displayed some of the improvisational qualities that are reflective of, dare I say, the incomparable Roberto Benigni. If there was a short coming in terms of the writing for a particular character in this film it was that of Lena, Martha's eight-year-old niece. Maxime Foerste did an above average job her portrayal of a traumatized child. She simply wasn't as dysfunctional as I anticipated based on the background activity in Martha's initial telephone conversation with her sister. Mostly Martha was a pleasant surprise, particularly based to the fact that the film didn't receive a great deal of hype or critical acclaim. If you're prone to enjoy this kind of flick and don't mind the foreign language aspect then you should really enjoy this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Martha is a great chef, but just can't seem to relax and enjoy life!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CAUTION -- the following comments DO contain SPOILERS.Germans are known, sometimes unfairly, for their precision without passion, and Martha, the chef at a very popular restaurant, is a glaring example. And that is her greatest failing. She is regimented, punctual, aloof, uncompromising. If a customer says his entre is not cooked just right, she will argue with him at the table, to the consternation of the owner, who can't afford to fire Martha, but requires her to see a therapist weekly.Two big events complicate Martha's life and make cracks in her shell. First, her sister dies in a car wreck on her way to visit Martha, and the 8-year-old niece comes home with Martha. Second, a cook is pregnant and an Italian chef is brought in. The niece is impossible, misses her mom, wants Martha to find the dad who is Italian and lives somewhere in Italy. Martha doesn't like the Italian chef's style. He is not regimented, he comes to work late, he sings in the kitchen. Martha feels threatened, but eventually warms up to him when his food gets the little girl to start eating again.Soon the three of them are doing things together, but Martha finds it hard to soften up. Then the girl's dad shows up, and she leaves with him. Martha puts her head down and goes back to work, joyless. Then the straw comes when a customer complains that his steak is not rare enough, she goes to his table and plots down a piece of raw meat, "Is this rare enough?" The owner is furious, but Martha quits, gets the Italian chef to help her with the language, and drives to Italy to see the girl, and bring her home, the three of them become a family. Very watchable, funny movie with great characters. DVD in German Dolby 5.1 with subtitles. Great fun watching the many scenes in the kitchen of the restaurant.</fullReview>

I also felt her insecurity when thecharming Italian shows up. A chick flick? Believe it or not, mensometimes feel insecure and threatened, too. Moreover, theactors had a chance to really journey through an "arc", ending up ata place different from where they began. That doesn't happen inmost films. Finally, if you see "Martha" and don't love it, I suggestyou watch it a second time, with your eyes closed. Listen to PauloConti. He's incredible!

To make such a virtue of German understatement, where feelings run so strong underneath the surface. To use German inflexibility as a foil for real people who are truly able to break the rules to achieve happiness. This is not a fluke, simply a side of Germany most people don't get to see. A restaurant kitchen is such a universal setting that it doesn't matter that the film is set in Germany, in Hamburg. It seems familiar to all of us. And the emotions too are universal, and touching. One of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Charms Outweigh the Clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The charms outweigh the clichés in "Mostly Martha (Bella Martha)." Of course it's right away different in that the phrase "German romantic comedy" isn't common and can be applied here.I loved that "Martha" herself is a competent, self-possessed professional and that's what attracts the guy to her. While we first meet her in therapy, her problems are those of work and personal life I could certainly relate to.While this will remind others of food prep movies like "Wedding Banquet," "Eat, Drink, Man, Woman," and "Tortilla Soup" or restaurant movies like "Dinner Rush" and "Big Night," (which all had male chefs), or "Babette's Feast," I have zero interest in cooking so cared only that "Martha" is very good at her job and at managing the restaurant kitchen.The restaurant characters seem like real co-workers, and amazingly the niece is not some adorable child actor but seems like a real kid whose surliness is legit.The Italian sous chef who comes on board brings the sensuality of the Mediterranean --in music (with a generous use of Paolo Conte songs), movement and language much like in the Danish "Italian for Beginners." And of course in romance, which is still delightful even as the clichés start appearing, her happiness is indicated by her loosened hair like Jane Fonda's in "Electric Horseman."But I enjoyed the build-up to their relationship in ever longer, longing glances and their mutual professional respect and concluding compromises.(originally written 9/2/2002)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty good food movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The greatest food flick of all time is "Babette's Feast." A close second is "Eat Drink Man Woman." "The Big Night" and "Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?" were pretty good too. This one belongs with the last two. Saying that a film is a great food flick isn't saying all that much, because guess what? There aren't that many! In fact, I think I've just named all the ones worth seeing. Being a lover of fine cuisine, I'm more than happy when another one comes along, so add "Mostly Martha" to the list.As in all food films, the food is a vehicle for moving the plot along and helping it unfold. But when a film centers around a character's livelihood to which that character is dedicated, it helps to see exactly what drives that dedication. That is easy to see here. The buzz word about food flicks is that they're "sensuous," but the fact that it's a cliché doesn't make it any the less true. I didn't find my mouth watering as I did while watching "Babette" and "Eat Drink," but it did make me a little hungry. So the film is as much about the obsession of the creative artist as it is about the rather conventional plot.In fact, the less said about the plot the better. Unless you can count the number of films you've seen on the fingers of one hand, you can probably figure out fairly early on how it will end. That really doesn't matter. The movie is about balance, something all of us need in our lives, a fact we too often forget. So it's a "chick flick." So what? "Chicks" make up over 50% of the human race, and I'll take this over some moronic testosterone-driven action film any day. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish life turned out this fulfilling for all of us frustrated, over-achieving perfectionists who never find happiness. (but of course it never does) This was a completely engaging film and the acting was superb. It was refreshing to see a woman holding the upper hand in the place of employment (a nice change!) - but of course her authority is soon called into question by the arrival of the upstart chef who has charm to burn. And her life is deliciously complicated by the added responsibility of caring for a child she didn't plan for. How come I don't meet men this likable in MY life?!?!It was a great story and the characters' situations were real. Don't bother with the lame remake (No Reservations) starring Catherine Zeta-Jones. It has been YEARS since I've seen this film and I still have fond memories of it. Only the best and most treasured films stick with you like that.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming love story for foodies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A German film that tells the story of chef Martha and the changes in her life and job after her orphan niece moves to her place and a new Italian chef joins the team in her restaurant. Love will be a catalyst in Martha's personal life, and also in the way she approaches food and her job as a chef.The movie is a nice mix of drama, romance, and "foodies" movie, with stereotypical characters: the flourish flirtatious Italian, the hard resilient cold German, and the rebellious troubled kid.The believability of the movie is heavily indebted to Martina Gedeck's performance as Martha and to child Maxime Foerste as her nice Lina. They both play with great conviction their respective hard characters. Sergio Castellitto is very charming as the Italian chef Mario, and plays his character with a mix of downgraded Italianism and Flourish Germanism, so to speak. The three of them have a great chemistry on camera and carry on the story well.Said this, I found that the romance story, although charming, was underdeveloped, while the struggling relationship with the kid was completely predictable and unoriginal. In fact this is just a traditional film recipe well carried on and well acted. However, the movie received an accolade of local and European awards and lead Hollywood to adapt the movie in No Reservations, adapting the plot to American tastes and turning it into a straight comedy.An enjoyable film with stereotypical characters and situations, and very good performances. Perfect for foodies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Bella Martha" is an almost 15-year-old movie by Sandra Nettelbeck. As in all her works she not only wrote the film, but also directed it. Also it was her very first movie for the big screen. Since then, in her next 3 projects, she has worked with Michael Caine, Jane Alexander, Gillian Anderson and Ashley Judd. Not too prolific though as she makes only one film every four years and next year she will turn 50. "Bella Martha" runs for roughly 100 minutes and was so appreciated that they made a US remake a couple years later with Catherine Zeta-Jones in the lead role. Here, however, it's all about Martina Gedeck. She won the German Film Award and also the German Film Critics Awards for her portrayal here. Sergio Castellitto (the male lead, you may know him if you're Italian or have watched Narnia) and Nettelbeck herself also scored some awards recognition.Idil Üner and Ulrich Thomsen appear in smaller roles here and the rest of the cast is not particularly famous, but still all experienced German actors. Gedeck has been in "Das Leben der Anderen" and "Der Baader Meinhof Komplex" since then, but the child actress, Maxime Foesrte, here has not been in films for several years now. Maybe she is back to "normal life". Would be a shame as she shows some potential here. She plays the daughter of a woman who gets killed in a car accident and has to deal with her aunt as her new "mother" from now on. Obvious, as a big part of the film is about cooking, they won't miss out on the funny parts that Gedeck's character does not prepare spaghetti for the girl, but instead highly exquisite dishes or wants to show her in one scene how you make the perfect cr?me br?lée. Or another comedic highlight were her sessions with her psychiatrist. And then there's the more serious parts of dealing with death or finding ways to a more fulfilling life.Bella Martha is a good mix of comedy, drama and love story, smartly written and with good performances from everybody involved. Not much wrong with this film except the cheesy title perhaps. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tough and touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chef Martha Klein (Martina Gedeck) is the tough top chef in the kitchen. She's great with food but isn't good dealing with people. She doesn't take criticism well. She has anger issues and is under orders to therapy. When her sister dies in a car accident, she is left with her saddened 8 year old niece Lina who constantly asks to go home. Lina's father is named Giuseppe living in Italy. Martha has a difficult time, and the owner hires another chef, Mario (Sergio Castellitto) to help out. There is also a divorced architect living downstairs that she is infatuated with. She struggles with the new chef, and her difficulties with Lina.This is a German movie remade later as 'No Reservations'. This one has a more compelling darker tone. The relationship between aunt and niece is much tougher and very touching. The food looks delicious. Mario provides a bit of charming comic relief. The ending is a little too neat, but it's a fine happy ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>European cinema seems able to draw upon some excellent actors, who perform on screen without an audience thinking "oh, they are actors". This movie is witty, and painful, and musical ---- you will be humming or attempting the words of that Italian song! Martha the chef is workaholic in a way we all recognize and are not repelled by. Her scenes with the therapist are great comedy. The restaurant-kitchen scenes surpass anything I have previously seen in any movie --- thrilling, absorbing, completely enthralling. I don't know why Hollywood wanted to re-hash this top-drawer movie into a B-entertainment piece under a silly title. I have watched MOSTLY MARTHA perhaps six or seven times and will certainly repeat the pleasure. After I first saw it in a movie theatre, I walked out asking my companion "Why can't all movies be as genuine as this?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming relationships-comedy around food and cooking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Food and love have always been a winning pairing, since they both stimulate senses and emotions, and when they are well paired, their combination may turn into something explosive. This is true in real life and this is very intelligently portrayed in this charming movie. The risk with it was to fall into the clich? of the Italian fool, all pasta and passion, who in the ends melts the rigid German woman. Not at all, on the contrary the two main characters, Mario and Martha, belong to the emotionally deep, intense and, moreover Martha, complicated souls, revealing themselves gradually, letting the viewer enter their special world with delicacy, and slow timing.I felt sympathy with Martha, I could really feel her sense of uneasiness with men, kids, and people in general, although keeping such an emotionally deep richness inside her, but so contained and so mistrustful about feelings, about life. Sergio Castellitto as Mario is simply great, I am fond of him, he's so attractive, mainly in the way he manages to respect Martha's inner precious but difficult emotional world (superb is the scene when he lets her taste some food with her eyes blindfolded, and then letting her guess a flavour by kissing her unexpectedly).Kitchen setting is always intriguing, enhancing sense impressions of tastes, smells, and consistencies of food: the movie renders the joy and the physical pleasure which food can give with intensity, also thanks to some intriguing music by Paolo Conte ("Via con me" is a wonderful song).Eating is a pleasure, loving is a pleasure, love and food work in the same direction, but it's up to men and women to take the necessary step to make them work in perfect accordance, and to make the recipe magically successful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Female Chef in Hamburg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot to Mostly Martha, a 2001 release from Germany which I recommend over the follow-up Americanized version, can't be more than basically established without introducing spoilers:The female chef of a fashionable restaurant in the port city of Hamburg schedules a visit from her sister and niece.There. That's all that can be safely said, except that the movie contains at least one major mood shift.Through early 2009, this is my favorite foreign film of the first decade of the 21st century, second only to Seabiscuit among movies from that not yet completed ten-year stretch--and, with me, ranking ahead of the several recent German historical dramas that have gotten more acclaim.The final eight and a half minutes arrive suddenly, and include three impressive minutes of musical interlude unaccompanied by any dialogue. The score to the closing credits is worth listening to, also. The ending is what stamps the movie's stature, along with a solid lead-actress performance by Martina Gedeck and a good script and capable directing by Sandra Nettelbeck.Guys, put this down on your prospective date-movie lists, and do not read or allow any reading, beforehand, of either the front or the flip side of the DVD cover. Watch with food and drink to perhaps enhance the treat, because the movie will make you hungry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Europeans United</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>mostly Marta is a delicate tale about cultural conflicts under the veneer of European unity. Here comes Marta (Martina Gedeck), the imperious chef of a five star restaurant who rules the immaculate kitchen as her private fiefdom. Tragedy strikes. Her sister is killed in an Alpine accident and Marta inherits her niece Lisa as a ward.In the interim the restaurateur brought Mario (Sergio Castellitto) into the kitchen as sous chef. Mario is everything Marta is not: noisy, nosy, personable. The fat would be in the fire, but the restaurateur notes the change in taste of the well heeled diners for leaner foods.Can opposites attract before they destroy each other? The film is delicate throughout dealing with the knotty issues of cultural conflicts with great sensitivity.Mario: Why would (your niece Lina Klein) want to stay with her family in sunny Italy when she can return to cold and grey Germany to live there with a nut case like you? The film was remade and moved to an American milieu in NO RESERVATIONS. While Cathrine Beta Jones renders a bravura performance in the remake as the head chef, the remake is no match for the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazingly beautiful film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bella Martha was one of the best movies of this genre that I have seen in years. The film flows unrestricted, simplistically yet artistically. The cast could not have been better selected nor, in my opinion, could the movie been more beautifully filmed. The scenery in both Germany and Italy fit perfectly into the storyline, creating realistic ambiance. The interaction between Martha (portrayed by Martina Gedeck, who is quite an accomplished actress) and Lina, her niece, is genuine and as heart wrenching as it is heartwarming. The music is also a nice match for this movie - lighthearted and serious at just the right moments. For some fun, watch this movie then afterward watch its American counterpart - No Reservations. You will be amazed at the difference in the quality of the film - acting and photography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Mostly Martha</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The kitchen makes for a good setting for movies. There's wonderful food, chefs with personality, and a rat... wait, that's Ratatouille, Pixar's latest offering which unfortunately won't be shown here until the end of next month. On the other hand, a trailer for a romantic comedy seemed to have caught my eye. Also set in a kitchen, it stars Catherine Zeta Jones and Aaron Eckhart opposite each other as chefs who don't get along but ultimately fall in love, you know, the usual opposites attract formula, in No Reservations.But I was surprised that it was actually based on a German movie called Mostly Martha back in 2001, based on a pickup at the library, and reading through the synopsis, it just couldn't be more coincidental as that. Hollywood has been poaching remake rights to a host of movies in Asia, from horror like Shutter, to crime thrillers like Confession of Pain, to Korean romantic comedies like My Sassy Girl and the likes. And of course, remakes and adaptations of movies from the European continent too. I wonder how much more original stories can Tinseltown spin on its own, without resorting to cannibalizing from others.Written and directed by Sandra Nettelbeck, Mostly Martha is not your typical romantic comedy, contrary to what the Hollywood remake would suggest (from the trailers so far). The premise is of course similar. Martha Klein (Martina Gedeck) is the head chef for a restaurant, a to the book, no nonsense, proud chef at that. She has a rigid lifestyle, and finds herself so high strung that on her employer's advice, reluctantly checks herself in for therapy. Her niece Lina (Maxime Foerste) drops into her life one day, and both find it difficult to adapt to one another, with Lina at first glance being your typical stubborn, bratty child. And things become worse when Martha has to face up to competition in her own kitchen, with the arrival of Italian chef Mario (Sergio Castellitto), a man whose laissez-faire style just drives her nuts.If Hollywood were to take the script from here, it would make it a simple, expected romantic tangle between Martha and Mario, in which the trailer for No Reservations seem to suggest. But Mostly Martha is more than that. It's deeper, more subtle, has negligible snarky remarks passing off as comedy, and doesn't turn the kid into a precocious cutesy tot. It's steers towards powerful drama territory, with each scene beautifully shot, minimal dialogue which just catches your attention span, and subtle philosophical ideas tossed into the whole works. It examines the relationships between all characters in a very engaging manner, and doesn't neglect any of the main leads.What emerges is a classy movie, with interesting reminders on life and living life. I particularly liked how fine dining gets weaved into the narrative, be it the preparation, or the properties, or just to decorate the set. Don't watch this on an empty stomach, please! What I found true is its account that unlike food, there is no recipe to life which you can follow step by step to a T, based on fixed parameters which if followed accurately, will bring out that flavour in the end result. Life can't be run that way, and certainly there is no recipe or formula on how to lead a successful life, having success defined by one's values.My advise would be, given that Hollywood has adopted key scenes in its own release, and signs do seem to point No Reservations towards a true blue romantic comedy, if you'd like, watch the Hollywood version, but please comeback to the original source material, and you'll understand why Hollywood wanted to remake this, and for you to experience the actual, rich storyline that Mostly Martha (or its German title Bella Martha) is actually all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bit of Teutonic charm that brings you along almost effortlessly. It earns a 9 out of 10 from me, an almost perfect balancing of elements both sweet and savory. If you are a "foodie" then you will enjoy the kitchen scenes and attitudes. Food preparation is Martha's raisin d'etre, at least until she is forced to change from chef to caretaker of her sister's daughter. Then the grip Martha has on her world goes from "tight with the occasional slip" to "strained and slippery".Romantics will enjoy a process of interaction that becomes attraction between Martha and the new chef Mario. Their's is a perfectly paced interplay of her tense misgivings against his amiable demeanor. One almost wishes that Martha's psychiatrist demonstrated as much insight as Mario.No, the movie isn't perfect. The ending was a bit elaborate, a slightly simpler one might have been more effective. But it's by no means a bad ending as is. Small tweaks here and there would have made this a ten for me, but I suspect many viewers may find it a 10 in their books.I watched this with Rare Birds. Another supposedly foodie movie, but in fact, one that barely qualifies as such although Rare Birds is a pleasant two hours. Mostly Martha, as a double feature, would go very well with Chocolat. But it could also be paired with Eat, Drink, Man, Woman for a fusion of east - west dining/movies experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm loathe to write reviews but this film is one I love and when I looked on IMDb William J. Fickling's comment was the "fly in my soup" at the bottom of the page. Reading others comments I see that many people get this movie and loved it - bizarrely there are also a few morons who misunderstood the film and several self-proclaimed foodies who are anxious to tell the world that they know more about food and cinema than this movie can communicate.To address Fickling directly first - here is a comprehensive list of food movies which I am sure leaves out an enormous number of old ones and still further more from foreign shores but at least trumps your list of the ones purportedly worth watching:TAMPOPO MOSTLY MARTHA SOYLENT GREEN LA GRANDE BOUFFE DELICATESSEN MY DINNER WITH ANDRE KITCHEN STORIES BABETTE'S FEAST EAT, DRINK, MAN WOMAN THE SCENT OF GREEN PAPAYA BIG NIGHT LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE JAMON, JAMON HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS &amp; THE SON OF THE BRIDE (cheating a bit) THE COOK THE THIEF HIS WIFE AND HER LOVER ALIVE THE TRAVELLING PLAYERS GREED WEDDING BANQUET VATEL WILLY WONKA A CHEF IN LOVE GARLIC IS AS GOOD AS TEN MOTHERS SIDEWAYS KITCHEN HOTEL SPLENDIDE SUPERSIZE ME 9 1/2 Weeks DINNER RUSH FRIED GREEN TOMATOES... SOUL FOOD EATING RAOUL A Chinese FEAST TOM JONES (love that scene) WHAT'S COOKING (yes I'm aware that some of these movies are "food movies" by virtue of one scene only - but who's counting).Fickling writes "The less said about the plot, the better" - this is a film about characterisation, a film that explores the nuances of motherhood, working relationships, pride and the fragility of the human spirit. A film which shows triumph in the face of adversity, describes a difficult romance and how we can all become more than the sum of our parts. Admittedly there are no car chases, no "twists" and no murders (apologies to the plot spoiler sticklers there) but the film is nothing the less for it. What we do have are splendid character arcs and a generous director who allows the cast to act in an understated way which draws the viewer into the story. Several times I wanted to reach through the screen and give someone a hug and, big man that I am, I even welled up in one or two places. I laughed several times and ate a chicken, a salmon and a small cow after I finished it.Sadly the same man that wrote "the 'buzz-word' about food movies is sensuous" didn't feel the same way, but then someone who uses words like buzz-word isn't likely to. Stick one in the eye to the food snobs who tell you which dish to order and how to drink your wine, order this movie at your video rental because you've seen at least one or two movies in your life which, when the end credits rolled, made you feel like life was worth consuming and everyone could belong somewhere.Finally, to Mr. Fickling - your tone is both condescending and a little self-satisfied - but you're welcome at my house for dinner any time.killedcat</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. To me, Martha has a perfect character at the beginning of the film. That is, she is a loner, contented and orderly, a bit arrogant, a superior chef, a person with a benevolent obsession. She is larger than life. Hence, her employer's requiring her to go to the therapy that is ultimately wasted on her. Martha does have, however, a touch of loneliness, witness the delicious encounters between her and her new downstairs neighbor.As into everyone's life, challenges come to Martha. Although in grief herself, Martha must take up the care of her niece. Although Martha tries hard, the niece is an intruder.A second challenge is Mario who is also an intruder. He is a more "adult" threat in Martha's vulnerable mind. But, in fact, Martha's life is falling apart because of the niece and because of Mario.The beauty of this film is how these three persons come together, starting with Martha's act of desperation in asking Mario to call Italy for her.Great performances by all. The neighbor downstairs is terrific. The niece is superb as an unattractively unhappy child. Mario has that way of being deadly serious with a sense of humor. Martha is wonderful.

		<fullReview>Warmest congrats to Sandra Nettelbeck (writer and director). I agree with another comment I read here, about the actress playing Martha (Martina Gedeck), she is absolutely great. But then, the whole film is simply a gem.Every possible detail is "Germanically" controlled (consider, for instance, when Martha is about to take her niece for a ride in her car opens the right front door for her, but she silently opens the *back* door and gets into the car, a security rule not always taken into account by people who don't usually carry children in their cars, which I do since I have three of my own), and yet the film is highly emotional. The precocious actress playing the 8-yr old niece (Maxine Foerste) is outstanding, as is the actor playing the charming Italian chef (Sergio Castellito). You cannot but fall in love with Martha yourself, too. Added on 3-Jan-2008: Americans launched a remake with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Echhart, pretty insipid. Furthermore, they waived out a most important character from the original script. DON'T waist time with this awful remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wherever this film ventures, it succeeds. The food element is genuine, and as appealing as any food movie. The story is heartfelt and touching, and credible. The humor is not dominant, but it is very funny where it is used. One of the most interesting aspects of this film is how its main characters fit some common stereotypes, yet don't feel at all like stereotypes. Martha is so much the uptight, regimented German but has so much submerged below the surface that you can still identify with her. Just when you think she's loosening up, there's the hyperventilation scene. Mario would not stand out in most movie scenes, but set in Germany, his quirky flirtatious charm is attention-getting. Lina is portrayed brilliantly, and I look forward to seeing if this young actress will be in more films available in this country. Martina Gedeck was so convincing as Martha, I have a hard time imagining her in any other role, but I have no doubt that she has other great performances in store. A very rewarding, satisfying film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd liked a lot of this German comedy. Sincerely, I wasn't expect much of this picture, because I didn't known the director Sandra Nettelbeck. It's a kind of pop movie of high human and dramatic level. The characters are well designed and well acted by an unknown and professional cast. Well, Castellitto was knowed for some Italian films, but the German cast, I think, are not known in Brazil. People, intellectual or not, love people like us, who suffers, try to grow up, changing for better. Every viewer, man or female, identifies with Martha, her difficulties with feelings and general relationship. The story aren't much original, but the way that the director treated yes, with a charming and tender humour. The contrast between German and Italian cultures gives the fundamental basis for our pleasure in to watch this delicious and delicate movie,that I recommend for everybody who loves good and selected pictures.Welcome,Sandra, to the field of the good female German directors, like Doris Dorrie, for example.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For film buffs who like their movie viewing to include films which are not easy to categorise, this is a 'must see'. With superb acting by the whole cast, none well known to english speaking audiences, and with good direction this film deserves all the accolades that it has earned. The dialog is sparse, so very little is lost in the sub titling as can happen when one sees a foreign language film that has a lot of involved dialog. The plot summary given on the IMDb title page tells it all and without wanting to give too much away I'd like to say that it is one of the best films I have seen in an age of musical films acted by people who are not known for their dancing ability, early gang violence films made by well known directors and literary women films about being influenced by the pages of books!

The viewers could really feel that Martha had a great passion for food, and that cooking was an important part of her life. The little girl could also act well. Her facial expressions were very real. I particularly liked the scene when she pretended to be not interested in a dish of spaghetti, when in fact she wanted to eat it very much. The Italian cook was also good. His facial expression was constantly charming and warm, and when he sang and danced around the kitchen, the viewers could really feel that he was truly happy. This relieved some of the tension of the film.Another good thing about the film was that it stayed true to the theme of food. A lot of shots were dedicated to the art and beauty of cooking. I really loved an aerial shot In the kitchen, when over 10 people were preparing very nice dishes. From raw food to vegetables to preparing the food to cooking and arranging the food onto the plate, all the food was laid so elegantly. The scene was so joyful and colourful, that it made my heart smile.In summary, I find this film very warm and touching. It was very pleasant to watch this film.</fullReview>

Martha is also a terrific mother, thrust in a role she hadn't been prepared for. Her encounter with the Italian chef is a terrific plot. It is too easy to overlook her exceptional gifts as a cook, which is her blend of smell, taste, knowledge (like a composer in writing music), intelligence, and don't leave out passion. There are so many good restaurants in Brooklyn within blocks of where I work, but I think that Martha would be a star among stars.</fullReview>

This movie did not need sex and profanity to be well- done, which is my personal request for American filmmakers to realize, `you do not need it, you do not need sex and profanity to have a 'film'!' Of course, some would say that the love in this movie is unrealistic... who cares, it is a movie, isn't that what a movie is for - entertainment from a fiction world?I have been studying the German language and found the beauty in the language through this film. Of course, this movie is subtitled but I do not remember if I even once read the subtitles. This movie I feel is not for a universal audience, I believe it is for young adults and older adults. Maybe for a family. Not necessarily a movie for a teenage audience. Which is ironic because I am seventeen but my preference for literature and film is more mature than what my age specifies.I am offended by those who criticize movies just because they do not have any realistic conflicts, etc. in it. The audience personally takes what they want out of a movie. For example, from this movie, personally I took the theme, `be optimistic, when things seem to be rough, something is bound to be good sometime.'If you want a good movie in which you do not have to cringe each time a sexual scene is slapped in the movie or when the profanity is outrageous... I say, this is the one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this today and wonder why in the world this didn't get a wider US release. It's a charming little movie with wonderful acting that deserves a bigger audience. It's not really a classic, but it's better than 95% of what's been in theaters this year.Martina Gedeck, who plays Martha, is great actress who I'd love to see more of. Her performance is very lifelike, Martha's actions always seem like those of real person. Though she can be very stubborn, we really feel for her.Maxime Foerste, as Lina, gives one of greatest performances by a child I have ever seen. Again, very lifelike and touching.Segio Castellitto's Italian cook Mario is more of a stereotype, reminding one of Jean Reno in one of his lighter roles. I think this mostly a writing problem, and Castellitto does a very good with what's he's given.Overall, I highly recommend you watch this movie (assuming you can find it).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mostly Martha is a character study of a German chef, Martha (Martina Gedeck), who unwittingly becomes caretaker of her 8-year-old niece Lina (Maxime Foerste) when Martha's sister is killed in a car accident on the way to visit Martha. Martha also is embroiled in drama at her job at an upscale restaurant. She delights in food, including the preparation, the presentation, and the eating, but does not have a good bedside manner when it comes to dealing with demanding customers. So she and her restaurant-owner boss Frida (Sibylle Canonica) are often at odds, even though Martha creates meals that are wonderful.Martha's life changes when she gets the horrible news of her sister's death. The devastated and headstrong Lina comes home with her to her small apartment, hoping that her never-met father rescues her and takes her to his home in Italy. Martha contacts Giuseppe (Diego Ribon), but has no idea what his response will be. Meanwhile, Martha and Lina begin settling into a routine, which is a tug-of-war from the start. And things at the restaurant are challenging, too: while Martha is out dealing with the Lina situation, Frida hires a charming Italian chef, Mario (Sergio Castellitto), to help out. Martha is resentful, but gradually begins to be charmed by Mario herself, especially as it turns out that he has a way with Lina that Martha does not.Mostly Martha, in German with subtitles, is an interesting story. Although it is another in the series of films that are food-centric, it is mostly an in-depth look at Martha. The acting is excellent, and writer/director Sandra Nettelbeck has done a wonderful job of letting the actors just.act. As with most independent or foreign films, this one is dependent, not on special effects, but on a strong plot, excellent acting, and well-written dialogue. Martina Fedeck does a masterful job as Martha, and Sergio Castellitto (Mario) and Maxime Foerste (Lina) are wonderful in their roles.I enjoyed Mostly Martha and give it 8 stars, out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant and comforting, so what!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bella Martha is a pleasant and comforting german drama with comedic touches. All about how an uptight fraulein becomes a good mother and lover under the influence of an italian. Martha is a 30-something head chef in Hamburg. Her art defines her identity (the film itself abounds with cooking metaphors.) Martha's sister dies in an accident and she is saddled with the responsibility of caring for her grieving, 8-year-old niece. Too much of a challenge for lonesome Martha. Along comes Mario to the emotional rescue. As a cook, I thoroughly enjoyed the kitchen scenes, but the therapy scenes ring false and add little to our knowing Martha. Indeed, the film doesn't dig deep into the characters' psyches, particularly Mario, who is a walking cliche. It's the excellent acting of Martina Gedeck and Maxime Foerste that keeps this predictable feel-gooder afloat. Then again, given the scarcity of foreign-language screens in the U.S., Bella Martha is the kind of film that keeps more challenging and compelling films from abroad from being shown. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film twice, once at the Seattle International Film Festival and a second time in the second week of its limited city USA release. I enjoyed it immensely both times. The casting was superb. The story first rate, and the cinematography fabulous, but it was its direction that was so marvelous. Sandra Nettelbeck really showed her gift in the scene where Martha enters her Kuche after Mario and Lina prepared a sumptuous meal to discover that there is a total disaster. This could have been a totally second rate film metaphor for life or relationships, but Nettelbeck handled it sensitively at first, and then turned it into a nice comic moment. It was touchingly funny. The sessions between Martha and her Psychologist were very humorous too. The comic edge was wonderful.Once released on DVD, I'll add it to my collection. I think it would make a good subject for discussion in a film class.</fullReview>

But then everything changes when she has to take care of her niece and a second chef appears at work.Everything in the movie is very genuine, up to the details. The apartment Martha lives in, even the car she drives, are all "in character". The Italian chef, though, may be a little bit too much of a caricature.The movie is dramatic as well as comic, serious as well as lighthearted. And never we too much "sauce", as is appropriate for a three-star restaurant. A must for everyone who likes a well selected palet of drama, romance, and the best culinary flavours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After some recent disappointments in food film -- especially "Big Night" -- it's wonderful to find a film like "Mostly Martha" that hits on all burners. This is what kitchens are like and this is how food is prepared...it's a beautiful work that reaches to the most intimate part of the consumer, just as good food does. The story is not complicated: a tightly wrapped woman chef has to explore her life and motivations when her young niece comes into her home and her kitchen. A slightly shabby-looking but wonderfully warm Italian cook is another key ingredient in the preparation of this not entirely predictable recipe. Don't bother with popcorn when you see this one; just make a reservation at the best restaurant you can afford for afters...you'll be very hungry. It's fun to see a film about people who are professionals that has no hookers, cops, lawyers, doctors or hair stylists...actors and direction combine to make this an excellent little movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly Martha is one of a trio of little cinema surprises this summer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER---SPOILER---SPOILERMostly Martha is a subtitled German import just opening in the USA. Martha [Martina Gedeck] is a gourmet chef---and control freak---with issues; her only social contact is with her shrink, whom she interacts with through culinary devices. As a consequence of a family tragedy, Martha must provide a home for Lina [Maxime Foerste] her 8-year old niece with personality traits amazingly similar to her own. Martha must confront the real life issues here-to-fore addressed only in the abstract with her shrink; conflict is inevitable. Humanity enters the two female's lives in the form of Mario [Sergio Castellitto], an Italian chef, who naturally speaks both the languages of food and love. Mostly Martha is one of a trio of little cinema surprises this summer; the others are Tadpole and The Good Girl. This film is a refreshing story in the European style about the bittersweet relationship between a child and her aunt. Martha is a complex and mysterious character perfectly played by Gedeck; she's a joy to watch. The film really sizzles with emotion in the kitchen as the characters' shared love and passion for food overcomes their differences. This aspect of the story line has much in common with other `food movies' like Big Night [1996] and Tortilla Soup [2001]. Outside the kitchen Martha' frustration and inability to deal with her personality equal make you feel her pain. Mostly Martha is a delightful film that will bring a smile to your face and a twinkle to your eye. It's been wowing European audiences for about four [4] months and played to an upscale full house, including families, at the showing I attended. The film runs a tad long to support the deliberate character and story development that would be more quickly finessed in an USA product. But then again, that's part of its charm. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Writer-director Sandra Nettelbeck's first feature length film "Mostly Martha" feels like the work of a veteran director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mostly Martha" was on at the SF Landmark cinemas for a pretty good run. When I finally got to see it, I was absolutely satisfied by the experience. A German film about a top female chef who knows everything about and in terms of ? including social interactions, even when communicating with her therapist ? it's always FOOD, and nothing else! It's about the life ?adventures' around her, and when the subject of her 8-year old niece turns up and encounters with an Italian chef happens?she gradually learned to let FOOD not be front and centered , letting herself be open to other things, other persons to come into her 'defensive' space. The film's other title is "Bella Martha" - beautiful Martha, indeed. It's sensitively well written and directed by a female director, Sandra Nettelbeck, with the realization of the story by terrific performances of the three lead characters: Martina Gedeck in a perfect portrayal as Martha with all the emotional nuances, Maxim Foerste in her first film as Lina - young daughter of Martha's sister that helped shift Martha's self-attention, and Sergio Castellitto (who's seen in "Va savoir" - French, "The Last Kiss" - Italian, and here in "Mostly Martha" - German) as Mario the sous-chef hired - by chance or fate - who assisted Martha in the journey of tender lovingness besides giving her a good shake into reality. The storyline is by no means simple, it is quite dramatic, with a back story of grief that Martha's experiencing. In a steady pace, we see Martha's character changing as the events unfold, requiring her to stop, step back and think what she should do, how she should handle the situation presented to her. There are life lessons, with tears, laughter and smiles.The complementing jazzy music, I fancy. Nettelbeck actually included the tune "Never Let Me Go" - a song which I remember from a Nancy Wilson album ("Yesterday 's Love Songs, Today's Blues" on Capitol Records label in the '60s). The tune (not the lyrics) was optimized during a romantic interlude, with interesting cinematography at play.Kudos to Paramount Classics for distributing the film. There are many worthy films under their wings. For example: Director Patrice Leconte's 1999 "Girl on the Bridge, The" with Daniel Auteuil as Gabor the knife throwing traveling performer and Vanessa Paradis, the counterpart hero/anti-hero of a fascinating story filmed in superb black and white. Writer-Director Rod Lurie's 1999 "Deterrence" with Kevin Pollak as president, and Timothy Hutton and Sheryl Lee Ralph delivering sharp performances in a modern "Fail-Safe" situation.I look forward to future projects from Sandra Nettelbeck, and Martina Gedeck - such passionate work they delivered.</fullReview>

Martina Gedeck portrays Martha's growth with a tour-de-force of outstanding acting, and the supporting roles are also uniformly excellently portrayed. The film draws you in within the first minute as Martha is seen describing a sumptious meal as she lies on her analyst's couch and never lets go until the final uplifting ending, cleverly rounded out with a series of short conclusive vignettes as the credits role out.

		<shortDescription>"Mostly Martha" weds subtle film-making with stereotypes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoiler Martha Klein (the lovely Martina Gedeck) is a superb chef in this German movie written and directed by Sandra Nettelbeck, but she's without intimacy in her life and her precision in the kitchen is matched by uptightness everywhere else. Along comes the death of her sister in a car accident, leaving an eight-year-old daughter, Lina (Maxime Foerste), to complicate and ultimately warm up Martha's life. Lina starts sleeping at Martha's, but won't eat, and has no enthusiasm for school. Martha hopes to find Lina's lost Italian father because she can't figure out how to control Lina or make her enjoy life again.Then Martha goes back to her kitchen and finds the restaurant owner has hired a second in command to fill in for her, a mellow, flakey Italian artiste (and admirer of her cooking) named Mario (Sergio Castellitto) who's everything she isn't and who soon cons Lina into scarfing spaghetti. (Lina warms to Mario because she wants to find her dad)."I wish I had a recipe for you," Martha tells Lina. She's so limited she even talks to her shrink about nothing but cooking. Oddly, if humorously, the shrink caves in to this and in a final scene is shown trying out a desert on her made from her recipe. As meticulous as ever, she says it was made with the wrong sugar."Mostly Martha" ("Bella Martha") is built out of the cliché contrast between cold Germans and warm Italians and asks us to believe that an Italian can open up a chilly German girl's heart and make her human. This is a feel-good movie about depression, frigidity, and loss. It's moving when one sees the starving, grieving little girl take her first mouthful of pasta and start to smile again, but one knows one's being shamelessly manipulated.The movie has a glossy look that builds from the severe elegance of the restaurant (called the Lido, which shows an Italian's likely to come in eventually and take over) and the cool beauty of the star, Ms. Gedeck. It gradually modulates into a greater sense of life that comes from seeing lovely food and a grizzled Italian singing. What makes "Mostly Martha" compelling is its subtlety and restraint, the gray light in the immaculate kitchen, Martha's cool yet expressive face. Sandra Nettlebeck knows how to make a story clear without hitting you over the head with its points.I was reminded of Nanni Moretti's "La stanza del figlio" ("The Son's Room"), which deals with the death of a son and a family's effort to cope with the devastation wrought by it. Here the heroine is really incapable of dealing with the death that has happened otherwise than by going back to work. She's incapable of showing much physical warmth to the little girl. You wonder how this sudden adoption by Martha can be any good for Lina especially when after babysitting fails Martha starts bringing her to the kitchen all evening and the child begins to get to school very late and then skip it altogether. There is the same sense of devastation and confusion as in "La stanza del figlio," in which the psychiatrist father went back to work, but couldn't function any more.Somehow Mario turns this around. He not only brings Lina out of her shell but he humanizes the reluctant Martha. I suppose this is true to life on some level, that real German women go hunting for Latin lovers on vacation or at home; in fact Lina may have been the fruit of such a union. But it's hard to see it happening in a movie without its seeming ridden with clichés. This is the paradox of "Mostly Martha": it's a subtle, elegant movie whose resolution is a set of clichés.Despite the nuance and beauty -- not to mention many moments of charming humor -- of "Mostly Martha," it still seems too schematic, its finale too quickly tacked on to make a satisfying movie. Martha remains a paradox. Her specialties are lush items like pigeon with truffles, yet everything about her life is spare and bare. Oddly, in a movie about food, we see a lot of people unable to eat. It's almost too in character that Martha often takes refuge during rush hour in the kitchen by entering the walk-in freezer. As the movie ends, she has left the restaurant and her life is transformed. But the scene with the shrink suggests that she has not changed one wit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.This is a German movie, which is to say that it is mechanical. But it is an intelligent German movie, so one can expect it to be introspective and reflexive. And so it is.It starts out with very crisp, engineered shots and editing; incidentally, our heroine is crisp, mechanical and engineered. Moreover, so is her creation: three levels.As it progresses through the old (dare I say mechanical?) plot device of `unprepared adult unexpectedly inherits sweet kid,' it becomes more emotional and Italian. As it does, the photography and editing mutates to the characteristic, veristic languor of Italian films. And the food mutates as well. Three levels.As food films go, this is one of the best, though perhaps not as engaging as others. `Cook, Thief...' is perhaps the most cinematic and sensual, `Eat, Drink..' the most flavorful. But this is the most integrated in its matter and manner.Others: `Babbette's Feast,' `Big Night,' `Wedding Feast,' `Tortilla Soup' (bad), `What's Cooking' (bad)...Redheads again are featured, including brown and blond hair lit to be red, and this helps a lot.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mostly Martha" was a Netflix rental I did not expect to like as much as I did. First, there's the matter of the spoken language being German, with Engish only in the subtitles. Then there's the off-putting character of Martha herself, a restaurant chef who's both dismal and a certifiable nut case. Martha's stoicism breaks down only when her obsessive-compulsive side takes over as she combats chaotic outbreaks in the kitchen -- and in her life once her little orphan niece gets thrust into it.Martha's apartment reflects her personality in the spareness of its decor and grayed-down color scale. This is all about control, and Martha struggles mightily to keep it as her world tumbles down around her. How can this scenario be funny? Actually it is -- in an approaching-train-wreck sort of way. When Martha's boss brings a male Italian chef into the kitchen, all hell breaks loose. At first I found each of the main characters in this film almost painful to watch -- and yet as the story slowly unfolded, I was surprised to find lovable aspects in every one of these people -- particularly the laid-back Italian chef who proves to be an unexpectedly joyous ingredient added to the mix in the kitchen. Ultimately "Mostly Martha" is a lovely, life-affirming story and I tell you now this film is a jewel. You will come away from it feeling cheerier, with a greater appreciation of life in general. It's even more heartening to watch the second time around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super cute and fun movie +++ !!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its rare these days to REALLY enjoy a storyline, enjoy witty dialogs, real human characters, and great background music - and a truly happy ending that not only is realistic - but a great lesson in life besides! Grab a glass of wine, or stein of beer, and sit down to enjoy the little gem of a flick!!!! Oh, my gosh - i need to write 10 lines! Well - here's my favorite things about this movie: 1) Characters are "real" - and the actors are FANTASTIC at portraying them! 2) Scenery is awesomely authentic .. I've been to northern Germany and it really IS that gray folks! ... and Italy really IS that sunny and beautiful! 3) Plot is SO WELL SUITED to daily single-parent life in the US ... and the moral of the whole story is that "it takes a family to raise a child .. and the child brings "life" to the otherwise mundane self-absorbed life of a perfectionist professional. 4) The Therapist character and sketches are extra icing on an already delightful cake!Bon Appetite!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILER ALERT** Mostly Martha is about a woman who has a very planned life that revolves around her job - being a chef. She is always cooking, whether in the kitchen or not. She doesn't really have time to relax or have fun. Her life quickly changes when her niece, Lina (8) , has to live with Martha. She doesn't know anything about being a mother and there are times where they are both quite frustrated with each other. Lina is a very quiet, private person until the arrival of another chef. Enter Mario, a crazily happy Italian chef. Soon Martha &amp; Mario fall in love and Lina is a happy part of their lives. Mostly Martha (or in German, Bella Martha) is an enjoyable film when you need a mood lift.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how this poignant drama got dubbed a "comedy,' except for the situational humor: this movie has no "gags" and it needs none.Although the movie doesn't account for how Martha got the way she was; so different than her sister, it sure provides us with a delightful account of her evolution! The lighting, camera angles and facial expressions reinforce a very authentic script.The movie flirts a little with cultural clichés (Martha the Teutonic chef vs Mario the effusive Italian who wears his feelings on his sleeve) but never goes over the top. This movie did make me feel good, but I don't feel like i've been manipulated or tricked into it!I'd like to buy the DVD. It's definitely a movie I'll watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mostly Martha" is a superb movie. I never give a movie 4 stars (out of 4) until some time has passed, so that I can see if it stands up over time.Mostly Martha does stand up. I give it 4 stars.I almost don't know how to state it without sounding too glowing.But it is a movie about life, about love, and even about food.A control freak, who thinks she's got it all under control, and who needs to have things under control, has her life entered in a sudden way by her 8 year old niece.The entire construct begins to erode.She, her niece, and a new chef at her restaurant, who's got a whole different take on how to live one's days, learn from each other in ways that are beautiful.Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Martha is a cook who keeps to herself, until someone comes along that helps her to realize that life has more to offer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My teacher had us watch this film in German class last year, and I must say that I really enjoyed it. Not only did watching that movie over and over again help improve my German, I also enjoyed the plot. Martha is easy to relate to. She seems depressed, and out of touch with the world. She appears to live for one thing;cooking.What's great about this movie, however, is that she discovers that life does in fact have more wonderful things to offer her, if she would just give people a chance. It's interesting to watch Martha go from a sad, lifeless woman, to someone who seems to have more of a purpose in life.It's definitely worth seeing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but moments don't connect as well as they should in this film of moments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Belle MarthaThere is a type of film I love, a "film of moments." This is one of those. In such a film, the plot as such is weak, but it comes out very well because of the succession of moments make you feel something.Critical to such as film is connecting the moments, making them seem relevant together. This film does it, yes, but insufficiently. You feel, at many points in the film, sort of like it isn't going anywhere.The acting is overall good, but Maxime Foerste as Lina blows you away. This kid has real talent, and is someone to watch. Sandra does a decent job of directing- the scenes in the therapist's office stand out, but the direction is by no means great.Overall, this is an above-average romantic comedy, but it's not a great film.7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A soft but deep film, delicate and feminine,about the difficulties we all have in overcoming our personal problems to sustain true and affective relationships. The director shows the main characters feelings through their expertise in the art of cooking. A perfect recipe for a very digestive story, with the touch of a true chef.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thoroughly delightful film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mostly Martha" is an utterly delightful motion picture that skillfully combines drama, comedy, and romance. This is one of many European films that deserves much more attention and appreciation in the United States than it has received. In addition to the skillfully told story, I was particularly impressed with the high quality of the acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3 stars (out of 4)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film opens with Martha (Martina Gedeck, who looks like a younger and thinner Kirstie Alley) on a psychologist's couch. But instead of talking about normal counseling things, she is talking about what flavors go together and other food-oriented things. The psychologist asks why she bothers coming, and she says that she only comes because her boss insists.It seems that Martha is an outstanding cook, but is a little temperamental. Okay, maybe more than a little. If a customer has a complaint, her response is to attack the customer's lack of taste rather than to smooth the situation over. One is reminded of the film "Big Night" in these scenes. Needless to say, this doesn't work well. Oh, and Martha also has a tendency to "hide" in the restaurant's walk-in freezer when she gets overwhelmed by what's going on around her in the kitchen.The second main character is another chef named Mario (Sergio Castellitto, who looks a bit like Barry Manilow). Martha assumes that he is intended to replace her when her boss hires him, and in fact he is very talented. I won't say much more, although this axis of the film is not exactly surprising.The third main character is actually introduced before Mario, but because this character is not on the film poster and there is more surprise involved, I won't say more, except that this character's introduction makes a very large difference in Martha's life.It's very hard to pin this film down. It is often funny, but it's also a drama, and a cooking demonstration, and more. The performances are all good, the story moves clearly but not overly predictably, and the film looks good. It is surprising to learn that it was made by a first-time feature film director.You won't finish the film as hungry as you would after seeing "Big Night," but you will want something good to eat. As this film is now essentially gone from theaters, you will probably be seeing it at home, but do seek it out if the normal formula films are getting stale. Just make sure to stock your kitchen well first.Seen on 10/23/2002.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not appetizing at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bella Martha doesn't convince me. Martha, the frustrated top cook, is out of place in this role. As are the unreal clean kitchens, settings and props. No stains, no live, no love. The cooking doesn't make you wanna eat. The cast is so polished they are almost like window dressing dolls. When the little niece is in hospital she wears the make-up of a woman on a night out. Martha's counterpart is an insanely optimistic cliché Italian, who had to be dubbed (which is badly done). Then there is the incredible story of the rebellious niece who loses her mother (Martha's sister) and who is handed over to an totally unknown Italian father as if it were an Ebay-trade. Then there is the pointless appearances of next door neighbor Sam. Of course there is an happy ending after 90 boring minutes, In style with the movie: not convincing at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Movies I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tight, emotionally taut, warm and cold in the right proportions.The acting especially of what's her name who plays Martha is on a par with Merly Streep who I believe is the touchstone for real movie actresses.Because the acting so completely conveys the feeling of the film it can be seen over and over again. There are no artificial cine tricks to break the emotional grip. Nor does the story have unnecessary scenes which could allow the viewer to lose the connection.The director has retreated from the scene and allowed the actors to convey the feelings. It is more like a live theatrical performance than a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well..not bad..but</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay..it wasn't bad. But I did fall asleep in the theater. It had some qualities that were good..the niece struggling between studies and work. Martha getting her life on track, and trying to find the respect she deserved. The movie to offered little for me, but the colors of food. It seems there is a trend these days that independent movies are becoming popular only because they are independent. I found this one to be the same genre. Martha could have given us some very heart-tugging moments. Instead it cooked up a very slow-paced movie that presented little humor in such a dreary life. There were a lot of missed opportunities that her mind could have spoken to the audience. Instead it offered the usual villains and the knight wearing a chef's hat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly Martha: 4/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mostly Martha isn't. It's all about Martha. We find out so little about the other characters, we only know stuff about the main character, and even then it is a very little amount.Martha (Martina Gedeck) is a master chef who has to make every dish perfect. She's the second best cook in the city, according to her boss. Of course, Martha doesn't think that. When the customer thinks a dish is undercooked, she forgets that the customer is always right.Martha's sister dies, and her daughter Lina (Maxime Foerste) comes and stays with her for awhile. We don't know squat about Lina (except that she doesn't like oysters), and we don't learn anything about her as the movie progresses. Her behavior (skipping school) is something we have no idea she is capable of; they make us think that she is an angel and she does something dastardely, but there's no proof that she was an "angel".The various other characters that come into play don't work either. Sam (Ulrich Thomsen), Martha's neighbor, has nothing to do except to be there whenever he is needed in the script. Speaking of the script, I thought it was a comedy. One laugh, one smile. I guess I was mistaken, but it's upsetting that people actually think it's a comedy (just like Gosford Park). The music cues were often too loud, and seemed to be for a dramatic scene in a comedy (not to mention it sounded like music from the computer game The Sims).On the other hand, Gedeck was good as Martha, she had me convinced that she Martha, the busy woman who didn't really have any life. I also thought Foerste was fine as Lina, but her emotions were uneven. She didn't cry when her mother died, but she was really upset when Martha forgot to pick her up. It wasn't her fault, it was the script's. She was mortified at Martha at one part, and then after a very un-motivating speech by Martha, everything's honky-dory.The running time could have been trimmed down, and the script was very predictable. Once Martha meets a new chef at her resturant, they initally hate each other? Three guesses on what happens, and the first two don't count. I would not recommend Mostly Martha (which is a stupid name for a movie anyway), and there are better limited-release movies out there to see.Rated PG for mild language and thematic elements.My rating: 4/10In German with English subtitles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>predictable chick flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film bored me most of the time and irritated me at parts. Pure chick flick, avoid this if you like good films at all. Very predictable, full of cliches. Very American in style; it's just like all of those thousands of films churned out every year with Hugh Grant or Richard Gere. Horribly sappy. Two hours I'll never get back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>don't do it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really can't understand how this movie gets a rating beyond 2 (and 2 is already optimistic). In my opinion the acting was poor and totally non-charismatic, the story was not convincing and in addition, the title of the movie does not keep its promise as well.I've seen a lot of movies by now (among them also a lot of boring ones), but this particular one is the undefeated number 1 of the most boring movies existing on planet earth.Go ahead and convince yourself, but I think that you would be better off if you did anything else in these nearly two hours. Take a walk, go out drinking, meet a friend of yours, polish your car or masturbate in front of your computer, do anything and you would be more creative than the director of this movie was.One good thing: I liked the images, colors, the settings and the shooting in general. Props to the director of photography, but nobody can compensate such a story and such bad acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Regrettably deteriorated German customs in a slow movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was going to let this movie slip into oblivion without bothering to write about it, but the glowing comments of some other reviewers impel me to add my two cent's worth to present a different view.The storyline has been described elsewhere in much detail: A young German woman who is the top-notch cook of a fancy restaurant is suddenly saddled with the headstrong 8-year old girl of her deceased sister, and a big-mouth Italian cook is put at her side in the restaurant - disasters in her life and on her job. She has my full sympathy; but the movie has her deal with these problems not in exactly the way I would have wished.However, the movie shows, sadly, that the ethical conditions in Germany have deteriorated the same way as in America: It is totally acceptable to conceive a child out of wedlock, bring it up without a father, and spoil it without indoctrination of some respect for their elders.The story moves slowly at times, with us sitting there and watching people think, and the ending is totally ambiguous - perhaps to placate viewers like myself?</fullReview>
