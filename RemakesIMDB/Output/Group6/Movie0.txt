		<shortDescription>The first of Clouzot's dark masterpieces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Le Corbeau aka The Raven is a surprisingly vivid piece of film-making, a wonderfully cinematic dissection of a town torn apart by the poison-pen letters of 'The Raven.' The initial balance of power that maintains the status quo (A knows B's indiscretion, B knows A's, so neither can destroy the other without disgracing himself) is soon destroyed as the whole town learns each other's dirty linen, with suspicions, half-truths and outright lies soon lead to the town turning on each other in the search for a scapegoat. Tragedy, suicide and murder inevitably follow?This, of course, was the film that earned Clouzot a lasting reputation as a collaborator ? made for the infamous German Continental films, it was attacked by both the Nazis for discouraging the French from informing (their main source of information during the occupation) and the resistance for attacking the French moral character. Of the two, it's pretty obvious the Nazis were on the right track. Even though the Germans are conspicuous by their absence, it makes clear that the anonymous informer/s are undermining solidarity and making the town easy prey for predators (it is implicit in the film that the Raven is not the only poison-pen writer in the town as a veritable flock of Ravens emerge). The suspense comes not from the Raven's identity, which is blindingly obvious in this era of double-endings but must have seemed groundbreaking at the time, but from what damage the Raven will do next. Blessed with a surprisingly unlikable hero and a frankness lacking in US and British films of the period ? abortion and drug-addiction are discussed as readily as adultery and embezzlement ? there is a somewhat awkward Catholic moral imposed at the end (the good doctor learns it is better to let a mother die in childbirth to save the child than vice versa because the future is more important than the past) but it's still refreshingly dark. The script establishes character, setting and guilty secrets with remarkable economy and the film is blessed with a great use of location and some visually impressive set pieces: the funeral where people step around a letter left by the Raven before a child picks it up or the huge church silenced by a single letter fluttering down from the gallery are particularly striking. It also has a biting black wit and an interesting discussion about the interdependent nature of good and evil. A genuine masterpiece, and entertaining with it, the Criterion DVD boasts exceptionally good print quality - sharp and clear - with an interesting 18-minute interview with Bertran Tavernier on Continental and Clouzot and an interesting extract from a French documentary with Clouzot and others talking about the film and French cinema during the Nazi occupation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Secrets of a Gallic Peyton Place unearthed in Clouzot's misanthropic thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even the children in Henri-Georges Clouzot's Le Corbeau (The Raven) are sneaky and malicious. No doubt they reflect their upbringing in the stifling French village of St. Robin, where a series of poison-pen letters ? signed The Raven ? has galvanized the populace into a spree of spying, whispering and finger-pointing. Most of the letters accuse an aloof doctor (Pierre Fresnay) of occupying illicit beds and of performing illegal operations ? relieving women of burdens they're unwilling to bear.The accusations aren't entirely fanciful ? Fresnay has cheerless affairs going with the young wife (Micheline Francey) of a sententious, much older doctor (Pierre Larquey) and with the town pump (Ginette Leclerc), a smoldering seductress who's both lame and a hypochondriac. But the evil epistles disgorge more than enough malice to go around, alluding to dirty little secrets that touch just about everybody in this Gallic Peyton Place. When one of the letters causes the suicide of a young man dying of liver cancer, another slips out of a wreath on his casket during his funeral procession, and yet another flutters from the rafters of the church during the requiem mass. The search for the anonymous writer reaches the point of hysteria ? what else does the unseen assassin know, and who will be the next victim? Alone among the townsfolk, the mother (Sylvie) of the suicide seems resigned and resolute....Clouzot has been called the French Hitchcock, but when Le Corbeau hit the screens in 1943 ? released by a German production company during the Nazi occupation of France ? he wasn't welcomed as warmly as the mischievous but harmless cherub across the Atlantic. its mordantly unflattering portrait of the French bourgeoisie was shunned as little short of treasonous. To be sure, Le Corbeau, like most of Clouzot's work (Diabolique, The Wages of Fear) seems to take Shakespeare's misanthropic Timon of Athens as inspiration for its outlook on humanity; it's certainly no tourist brochure for the French provinces. When Otto Preminger remade the movie in 1951 as The 13th Letter (setting it in the Province of Québec, and starring Michael Rennie, Linda Darnell, Charles Boyer and Constance Smith), he had to pull back from the nastier material ? the routine, glum adultery, the rumors of abortions ? and apply rosier tints to the characters. None of that sentimental nonsense for Clouzot, who unrepentantly hewed to his malevolent vision right to the bitter end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little-known gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I pride myself on my knowledge of fine films, I must admit with a trace of embarrassment that I had never heard of this film before yesterday, when a brief blurb on the Turner Classic Movies schedule prompted me to watch it. My principal motivation for watching it was that it was directed by Clouzot, whose "Diabolique" and "Wages of Fear" are favorites of mine. What a find! While not quite the equal of "Diabolique," it comes very close, and it is the equal of anything by Hitchcock. Viewed simply as a thriller, it is marvelous, but it is much more than that. It is a profound character study and a howl of rage at the small-mindedness and pettiness of small town bourgeois communities. Considering that it was made during the German occupation, it can also be viewed as about as scathing a critique of Gestapo methods as a director could be expected to make without risking his life.After I saw "The Sorrow and The Pity" in 1971, I held the belief that any French artist who continued to work during the occupation was a legitimate target for criticism. Since then I have moderated this view somewhat. After all, who among us can honestly say what we would do in a similar situation? While there is no excuse for collaboration, can an artist be criticized for staying in his country and making a protest in the only way he can? I think that is what Clouzot did here, and the result is a masterwork. I only wish this were more widely known and publicized. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of misanthropy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clouzot's second film, "The Raven" was a masterpiece of misanthropy? Dissecting the moral collapse of a small French town plagued by a wave of poison pen-letters, Clouzot revealed a sour, embittered vision of human motivation? Greed, envy, hypocrisy and hatred are his characters' primary instincts; cruelty and mutual suspicion inform every act of communication? Such was the power ? and, perhaps, truth ? of Clouzot's vision of provincial life that it was interpreted as an act of collaboration with the occupying Nazis; rumors suggested it was shown in Germany as anti-French propaganda? Clouzot found himself unemployable for several years?The idiocy and falsity of the accusations were proved by his subsequent films?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a legend!and a black one!The most famous scandal of French cinema during the occupation,le corbeau (the raven) has not lost its feathers even today. The facts:it was produced by the German firm "continental" where Clouzot used to work as a scripter "en chef".But people went as far as saying that the movie was shown in German movie theaters under the disagreeable title "a small town like so many other ones in France" .Balderdash!The movie was never released in Germany at the time. As Roger Boussinot wrote in "l'encyclopédie du cinéma"(1980),"the bourgeoisie ,be it French or German was all the same everywhere,and Hitler,whose fortunes were on the wane ,had to treat his own (bourgeoisie) gently.Actually,the film ran into difficulties after the Liberation.It was the ideal scapegoat,and along with so many others ,like Sacha Guitry,Arletty(the female star of "les enfants du paradis"),Ginette Leclerc (the female star of "le corbeau")and other "collaborators" (sic),Clouzot was blacklisted.Why so much acrimony against "le corbeau"?Because it depicted life in French provinces in a way that was far from being idyllic.Anonymous letters are sent by the "raven",and drags the town through the mud.At first sight ,it seems like a simple whodunit:Clouzot 's first effort (l'assassin habite au 21) was a thriller.But there's more to the picture than meets the eye:what was latent in the first movie,we see it in its true colors:Clouzot's contempt for the whole human race,which will increase over the years.No character in "le corbeau " to identify with:the prototype of the film noir.Where is good?Where is bad?The most famous scene remains that of the light sway :the world is not black and white,what you thought black might be white and vice versa ."Le Corbeau' was released at the wrong time.It was too different from the "Occupation" movies which dealt with "escape" "dream" as works as Carné's "les visiteurs du soir" or Jean Delannoy/Jean Cocteau's "l'éternel retour" testify.It was 1947 before HG Clouzot was allowed to direct again.Four years has passed,and he came back to Belgian writer Steeman (whose "le dernier des six" and "l'assassin habite au 21" he had already adapted),but his venom and his misanthropy hadn't dried up,and more masterpieces were to follow.Otto Preminger directed a remake "the 13th letter" in 1951 which I haven't seen.On the other hand ,there was a French "modern "update by Yves Boisset (Radio Corbeau,1989)which is watchable but which can't be compared to Clouzot's thunderbolt back in 1943.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The plague of lies and deceit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Beware! I see all and tell all." So quoth the Raven, the pen name of the mysterious writer of poison pen letters that has plagued a small town in France with suspicion, fear and anxiety. Since this film was made by a Frenchman under a German controlled studio during Nazi occupied France in 1943, there is a subtext not necessarily explicit in the film itself, but nonetheless pervades its very essence. In Le Corbeau, Dr. Remy Germain becomes a victim when letters start circulating that accuse him of having an affair with a married woman and of being an abortionist. Both of these accusations are false but do contain half-truths, and it is the unfortunate tendency for groups of people, usually motivated by fear, to assume the worst. Furthermore, Germain is an outsider, in that he refuses to participate in gossip and avoids social clicks, which ironically makes him a target. Soon he will find himself under suspicion and alienated. Since virtually every member of the community has some skeleton in their closet, they would much rather turn their ire on the accused than risk having their own affairs aired by The Raven. And so the drama escalates to a crisis where Clouzot does not even spare the victim of blame. By assuming a position of detachment, Germain has turned a blind eye and thereby contributing to ignorance which only provides fuel for the Raven and the lies and deceit spread like a plague.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humanity, before there were tabloids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to a short interview with filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier in the French DVD-edition, the production company responsible for Le Corbeau was founded at the instigation of the Nazi propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels. It was supposed to produce unpolitical, ?uplifting" entertainment. And it functioned outside of the control and censorship authority of the collaborationist French Vichy regime. Somehow, with Le Corbeau director Georges Henri Coluzot succeeded in standing the company's original precept on its head, painting a dark and pessimistic picture of French society. The courage, daring (and foolhardiness?) of the makers of Le Corbeau is, I assume, beyond comprehension for a contemporary audience. Many French, not least the Resistance and the post war authorities, were offended by this portrayal. But, doesn't the title sequence say explicitly that it could have happened anywhere?That is true, of course. The pastime of making slanderous remarks and general gossiping is an universal one. In Le Corbeau, set in a small provincial town where everybody knows everybody, almost no one and hardly any scandalous subject is spared. Virtually the whole community gets caught in this whirl of wild accusations and suspicions (I detected a certain resemblance with High Noon). It is beautiful how the director gets the message through that nobody is entirely good or entirely bad, culminating in a great scene where a primitive lamp is sent swinging back and forth, letting the shadows wander.In this movie an anonymous writer sends letters to different people with wild accusations. Oddly, the big letters, the layout and even the short, catchy phrasing look like the prototype of a tabloid newspaper. The letters actually are hand made scandal sheets in an era when newspapers still were meant for fully literate people. One of the highlights of the movie is a funeral procession in which one of those letters falls from the horse drawn hearse. Due to its bold lettering it is immediately recognizable to everyone, but the mourners do not dare pick it up and wait until a curious child gets hold of it. Then they quickly gather around ? a wonderful scene.Le Corbeau is a timeless movie that I can highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depressing and disturbing but just great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This takes place in a small French town in 1943. Someone called "The Raven" is sending poison pen letters to various people in the town. They're filled with half-truths or outright lies but it begins to affect people. Quickly the whole town falls apart--relationships are destroyed, mistrust and suspicion are all over and it finally leads to suicide and a murder.Plotwise this may seem familiar to many but it's beautifully done. The film moves quickly, is well-acted and director Henri-Georges Clourot (who also directed the classic "Diabolique") does a wonderful job of visualizing the paranoia and hatred of the townspeople. The best sequence has a nurse running away when she thinks she is being chased by a crowd. Also this deals with sex outside marriage, pregnancy and abortion--taboo subject in 1943.Believe it or not this was seen as Nazi propaganda in its day! It was shot while France was being occupied and shows a town full of violent, suspicious and angry people. French people thought it was a slap in the face to them--showing them as ignorant people who let lies destroy them. That seems pretty silly now.It's now rightfully regarded as a classic. Well worth catching. I give it a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you liked "Diabolique" and "Wages of Fear" check out this earlier, equally good film by the same director. I was confused a bit by the quick introduction to all the characters, but the suspense is maintained and controlled with precision. The final 15 minutes are gemlike, a shuffling of possibilities, and the final 30 seconds a quick succession of powerful images. If you like whodunits, like Rene Claire's "And Then There Were None" you will like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ink which makes blood flow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Le Corbeau is directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot and co-written by Clouzot and Henri Chavance. It stars Pierre Fresnay, Ginette Leclerc, Pierre Larquey and Micheline Francey. Music is by Tony Aubin and cinematography by Nicolas Hayer.We are in a small French town, the actual name of which is not known and is inconsequential. A series of poison pen letters are being sent out to the town dignitaries, accusing them of all sorts of inappropriate operations. The letters are signed by someone calling themselves Le Corbeau (The Raven), and pretty soon the town starts to implode as suspicion and mistrust runs wild.Famously it was the film that saw Clouzot banned from making films, the then young director receiving flak from all quarters of the Vichy Government - Catholic Church - Left Wingers and others too! The asides to the Nazi occupation of France at the time not being acknowledged until some years later. That very theme obviously holds considerable weight, but it's not the be all and end all of Clouzot's magnificent movie.Clouzot and Chavance tap into the troubling fallibility of the human race, portraying a town quickly submerged in moral decay. There is caustic observations on the higher echelons of society, a clinical deconstruction of a town quick to cast aspersions without thinking of consequences, while the script boasts frank intelligence and no fear of censorship. That a town so ripe in respected denizens could become so diseased, so quickly, makes for powerful viewing. All are guilty as well, nobody escapes, even the youngsters are liars or cheats, thieves or rumour spreaders, this be a Hades town where negativity runs rife and leads to broken bodies, broken souls and broken human spirits.Very much a bastion of proto-noir cinema, it's photographed with an awareness to marry up to the acerbic thematic at work. Shadows feature prominently, even in daylight, canted angles are used to great effect, broken mirrors perfectly imbuing the fractures of the human psyche. A number of scenes are startlingly memorable, a funeral procession and a church service interrupted by one of The Raven's letters are superbly staged, the pursuit of a nurse through the cobbled streets is menacing, and the finale is hauntingly raw. Top performances across the board from the cast brings further rewards, whilst simultaneously adding more plaudits to Clouzot's direction. All in all, a remarkable, fascinating and potent piece of cinema. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poison pen letters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Le Courbeau" was Henri-Georges Clouzot's masterpiece. He paid dearly for having been instrumental in bringing it to the screen. At the time it went into production, an occupied France was not the best place to be. Because Clouzot's picture was made through German owned Continental Films, with its distribution rights, proved to cause the opposite effect than what the director wanted. He paid a high price for daring to present his tale about a page of shame in French History. Not only did the left despised this work, but Clouzot was also criticized by the Vichy government of the ultra right.The story takes place in a provincial town where poison pen letters begin appearing all over the place. They are being sent to everyone. The main target of the intrigue points out to one of the doctors in town who is accused of performing illegal abortions as well as carrying on illicit affairs with some of the town's respectable women. The letters destroy lives and reputations without any consideration to the ruined lives along the way.Not having seen this film in years, we must congratulate the Criterion DVD people for the glorious transfer they have done. Nicolas Hayer's crisp black and white cinematography is a joy to watch again. Tony Aubin's music score plays well in the background, complimenting Clouzot's vision.The film is also a joy to watch because of the fabulous performances from this talented cast. Pierre Fresnay makes a wonderful Dr. Remy Germain, the man at the center of the story. Ginette Leclerc, one of the best actresses of the period and Micheline Francey, who plays Laura, make a valuable contribution. Helena Manson seen as Marie Corbin, the hated nurse, does a fine job as well.We recommend any viewer to watch the Criterion DVD to admire Henri-Georges Clouzot masterpiece that speaks volumes about human beings at a trying time of their lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Raven Never More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is one thing that the French do better than almost any country, they produce first class cinema. Le Corbeau (The Raven) is no exception. Director Henri-Georges Clouzot makes a fine film from a popular novel about real poison pen strife in Tulane France during Vichy France in the early 40's.The first thing an American would notice about the film, there are references, nay, there are actual scenes of passion and sex, clothed, but obvious between Pierre Fresnay of the pencil mustache and Ginette Leclerc of the lacquered lips in a 1943 film. It's subdued, and the biting of the hand scene is a little pulpy, but these folks want to do it. Americans would have to wait for Bogart and Bacall before they got some steam.Since the Nazi's were essentially in control of France at the time, they thought an anti-informant film a bad idea. They hated it, but the French audience's ground down by what was essentially a military defeat and then an occupation, were thrilled by the tension and mystery of Le Corbeau. There are many secrets about the townspeople that complicate life in this tense little town until the culprit has a comeuppance. There are a number of classic original scenes like the light bulb scene or the avenging angel scene. This one holds up very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Intrigue from the "French Hitchcock"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It still amazes me that a film of this nature was made in 1943. It oozes with a grade of sensuality and vulgarity which would only resurface several years later in popular films of lesser qualities.We have here a film project so compelling that Hitchcock himself lost the bid for its purchase by a few hours (according to online reports).I can only imagine what sort of movie Hitchcock would have fashioned from its elements. But history sometimes lets fate decide the best outcomes in most interesting ways. I don't think this movie could have been made in the United States nor in the USA of latter days and have had produced such a fascinating delivery from cast, crew and director. From its first frames in a cemetery to its final quiet scene down a village street, every shot conspires to bring one into the story.The film is in French, which will not attract a certain segment of the film watching public. That is all well and good. Those who refuse to watch movies because they are in other languages deserve to be denied the pleasure of such masterworks as this film.Every characterization is spun out with attention to the most intimate detail. To paraphrase another reviewer: every person in this town appears culpable and sinister -- even the children are depicted with their own brand of menace brewing and boiling ready to swoop down and seize control.The cinematography has a more modern look and polish than just about any other film made during this time in film history. I admit there are scenes which display a brand of charming crustiness and provinciality which very few directors are able to reproduce today -- except of course for Woody Allen in "Zelig". Yet, they served their purpose for the telling of this story. But all in all, there is a feeling of immediacy that may not have been captured by many films of this era. It is brazen and bold. Other words that comes to mind are: an honestly wild touch of realism. All these add to the story in a most telling way which leads to the surprising denouement in a most curious and circuitous manner.Banned in both France and Germany at the time. In retrospect, we can see why. We have here a film which must have shocked a great number of people. But today? Not so much...but none of the strengths are lost. All of its potency remains intact.Le Corbeau is classic cinema which should be known more and recognized more - for its brilliance and power.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark And Subversive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone unknown sends a series of slanderous letters to various people in a small French town, the motive apparently being to drive a local medical doctor out. The letters are signed: "The Raven".On the face of it, the story is a kind of whodunit. Who is the Raven, and what motivates him or her? That's the mystery. There's no shortage of suspects, including the very doctor who supposedly is being hounded.But the film, released during the dregs of the Nazi regime in Germany, contains relevant political subtext and themes, not the least of which is the idea that someone, anyone, can be an informer. Knowing a town's dirty little secrets, the rumors, people's weaknesses and vices can be deadly in the hands of someone with a penchant for writing, and a desire to tell all. What the raven writes is to some extent true. And the truth turns the townsfolk against each other.The raven, as an anonymous entity, functions as a whistle blower, a snitch, a spy, a secret agent, a kind of Deep Throat. Thematically, the film is dark and subversive.The film's B&amp;W lighting is noirish and effective. I especially liked the sequence where a naked light bulb hanging down from the ceiling gets swung back and forth, like a pendulum, as two characters converse about moral pendulums of right and wrong, sanity and insanity, light and darkness. Where does one begin and the other end, asks a character.Although "The Raven" gets off to a slow start, the plot and the thematic import do pick up. Two-thirds in, the film curves deep, both as a whodunit and in its cinematic statement on the issues germane to whistle blowing and informing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gathering up films to watch last year that were affected by the Nazi Occupation of France,I found out about a title from Henri-Georges Clouzot which angered both the Nazis and the Resistance,and led to Clouzot being banned from film making for 3 years! Deciding to spend the next few months watching French cinema,I felt that it was time to finally open the raven's letter.The plot:Working in a small town,Dr Rémy Germain gets a "poison pen" letter from someone called "The Raven" who claims that they know about Germain having an affair with psychiatrist Dr. Vorzet's wife Laura,and also of performing illegal abortions. Trying to keep the letter under wraps,Germain finds his attempts to fail,as The Raven sends letters around town,publicly revealing peoples most personal details. Initially limiting the letters to peoples private lives, The Raven catches the town by surprised horror,when a letter causes a patient of Germain to kill himself.View on the film:Inspired by a real "poison letter" case that took place in Tulle, Limousin (signed "The eye of the tiger") in 1917,the screenplay by co-writer/(along with Louis Chavance) director Henri-Georges Clouzot sends the letters to the gripped with fear Occupied France.Openly having a character state "Evil is a necessary thing.",the writers tear the town up with a ruthlessly allegorical Film Noir,by making the search for The Raven,one where everybody is covered in grave doubts,and the "resistance" to the letter is torn down by mistrust and deceit. Getting on the wrong side of everyone, (with "The Raven" being revived in real life letters on the Clearstream affair,leaking details about French politicians secret bank accounts.) The writers strike a brutal punch against the Nazis, (who ran Continental Films studio) by making the letters drying up info being given to the self-appointed,ruling elite in the town.Leaving this work as a mark for 3 years,director Clouzot &amp; cinematographer Nicolas Hayer fly with the raven into the darkest areas of the town.Opening up the anxiety with each new letter,Clouzot sweeps across the town with ultra-stylish tracking shots which turn on every suspect in town.Unveiling the secrets,Clouzot soaks the title in an intense Film Noir atmosphere of dread,by superbly making the decayed shadows shining down on the residences subtly reflect the "grey" world they are trapped in.Joined by a stunning Micheline Francey (who got banned from acting for a year after appearing here!) as the unsteady on her feet Laura Vorzet, Pierre Fresnay gives an extraordinary performance as Germain,thanks to Fresnay trimming Germain's "clean cut" image as secrets fly out of his hand,and turn Germain into a Film Noir loner in the wilderness of the town,as the mysterious letter writer quotes The Raven,never more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cruel and fully aware of it. I was lucky enough to see this movie in the late 60s for the first time; since then, every time, I can watch it, I do!True, there is the sordid story about the Collaboration: who did, who did not? Who could avoid it: probably moving to Brazil would have helped a lot of directors, actors and crews. Yet fleeing France would have been rather lame than face reality. H.G.Clouzot's movie should have been called the Crow, rather than the Raven. Edgar A. Poe gave to the bird some poetic background. on the other hand, the manic croaking of the Crow, like an evil laugh would have been justified as the villain of the movie at one point seems to morph - psychologically- into a crow. Vichy was about hypocrisy. Anti-abortion, bourgeoisie's hidden lies, secret lovers, etc... Somewhere in France, a typical town finds itself obliged to look at its true self. Some people will commit suicide. A lover reveals itself (no spoiler) to be not really loving; the hero seems unable to choose who to court. Until it is revealed that real Love can sacrifice itself. At the end, Justice is served by Love, maternal revengeful Love. Like a goddess from a Greek tragedy. All the actors are doing an amazing job, down to the teenager whose heart is already housing hate and disillusionment. This script deserves a 2012 remake... maybe this time using emails and twitter as mean to weave the tale. Evil is in us and nobody is immune if we do not accept to give some Love back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scathing Expose of French Wartime Informing in a Thriller Format</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first of Clouzot's great masterpieces for the screen. It is simply amazing that he managed to pull it off under the noses of the German occupiers, indeed through one of their own production units. The film is a massive frontal attack on the craven Vichy mentality, of turning in one's neighbours, and of the 'informant society' which grows up under any occupying force in any country, but which thrived especially well in the hothouse atmosphere of the typical small French town. Of course, today, we are told that everybody was in the Resistance, but if you add them all up, the Resistance would have been greater than the population of France! In fact, the Resistance was tiny. President Mitterand claimed to have been in the Resistance, but he was later proved to have been a cringeing Vichy boot-licker. If the lies extend as high as the President of France, you can imagine how far and wide they spread lower down. In this film, a series of anonymous poison pen letters, written by an extremely well-informed but clearly deranged person, begin to flood the town. Eventually, hundreds of them are received. No one knows who is doing this, but vicious infighting takes place as a result of their 'information', reprisals and revenge are taken without reflection or hesitation, pretty much par for the course in wartime France. Everybody is inclined to believe everything fed to their feverish and vicious imaginations by the unknown letter writer, who calls himself or herself 'Le Corbeau' ('The Raven'). The whole society is set against itself and starts tearing itself apart on the basis of flimsy and unsubtantiated allegations from an unknown person. Clouzot shows the merciless progression of this herd insanity, even as he lived in the midst of it in his occupied country. When the Nazis realized what a cuckoo had been in their next, they refused to release the film. After the Liberation, the film was still prohibited and Clouzot blacklisted. The fact is that Clouzot had lifted the rock under which all the creepy-crawlies were living and had exposed them to view, and no one could take it, either of left or of right. The fact that he had done it in an entirely nonpolitical way made it even worse, since his target was not any doctrine or dogma but the weaknesses of human nature itself. He not only touched a raw nerve, he twisted it in his fist and made everyone scream with the agony of exposure. This is one of the most despairingly cynical films ever made, a brilliant, horrifying vision of human folly and madness. Clouzot really should have made a film about the Tulip Mania! One must keep in mind that France was the country where the most attention had been called to crowd behaviour and mass insanity, in Gustave Le Bon's famous book 'Psychologie des Foules' (1895, translated into English in 1896 as 'The Crowd', a book prominently reissued in France in 1947 when it was safe to do so). Clouzot and all French intellectuals were well aware of the issues of crowd madness raised by Le Bon half a century earlier, which had made a deep impact of French intellectual life. If Le Bon had been a filmmaker, he might have made 'Le Corbeau' to prove his points. Interwoven with the black and disturbing theme are various stories of corruption going on within the town, including the taking of opium, adulterous liaisons and betrayals, and a seething ferment of vicious living. One poor boy is driven to suicide in his hospital bed by one of the poison pen letters. This film is spell-binding in its portrayal of the underside of human psychology, and of how easily the dark forces erupt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The deadliest weapon:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of a small French provincial town infected by the mass hysteria of suspicion, spying, and hatred caused by the damning letters revealing the guilty secrets of all citizens and always signed "Le Corbeau" (The Raven) is an absolutely brilliant film. It is incredibly clever, involving, and extremely dark and leaves very little hope regarding the human nature and its motivations. The word is the most dangerous and the deadliest of weapons, and a gun, a knife, or a poison only finish the evil deed that always starts with the words. The humans are very creative in choosing the right words that will hurt and infuriate the fellow human being and start the unstoppable nuclear reaction of hatred, intolerance, and violence. H.G. Cluozot had difficulties working in France after he had made "Le Corbeau" in 1943 which was produced by the German company and later judged by French as a piece of anti-French propaganda. It took writers such as Jean Cocteau and actors such as Louis Jouvet, an admirer of Clouzot's work, to recognize the powerful subtext to Cluozot's controversial masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>marvelous little French film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film really is a fine example of good creative screen writing. Considering how marvelous most of Henri-Georges Clouzot's other film's have been (such as LES DIABOLIQUES and THE WAGES OF FEAR), this film didn't come as a complete surprise to me. I expected high quality and I sure got it.The beauty of Clouzot's script is the originality. The idea of an evil person who sends hundreds of "poison pen" letters anonymously in a small town is very intriguing--especially when it eventually results in false accusations, fights and even death. Throughout, the film does a wonderful job of exploring the darkest aspects of human nature. In other words, while the letters are vile, they only have the power that the mindless masses give them. Additionally, throughout the film, again and again, I found myself thinking I had figured out WHO was sending these letters. While the actual villain wasn't super-hard to figure out, I was guessing and changing my mind about who it was up until the very end. Great job.PS--a minor character in the film, Roger Blin as François was an uncanny double for Paul Muni--he almost looked like a long-lost twin!PPS--If you like this film, try the American film PARTY WIRE. While not as subtle or well written, it's a dandy film about gossip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than meets the eye (Spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film may have dismayed the Germans (as occupiers of France in 1943) and the French (both before the "Liberation" and after), but it cannot simply be reduced to a film that opposed informing on fellow Frenchmen (the presumed hidden anti-German message) nor a film whose portrait of French people as petty snitches undermined efforts to rally the Resistance. The film raises questions not only about social life in France under the German Occupation, but also about the foundations of the social order in general. First, it's necessary to be clear that "the Raven" was not merely Dr. Vorzet, for as he himself says (perhaps in self-defense), it was impossible for one soul to write the more than 800 anonymous letters that were penned over the course of a few days. Although Dr. Vorzet may have started it (or perhaps his sister-in-law, Marie Corbin), the practice of denouncing the dirty little secrets of one's neighbors spread like a contagious disease. Second, one should bear in mind that the accusations contained in the anonymous letters bore some approximation to the truth: for example, that patient in bed #13 had terminal cancer, that public officials were guilty of embezzling funds (we don't know this for sure, but the defensive attitudes of the accused make it obvious what Clouzot thinks), that any number of individuals were having or were on the verge of having adulterous affairs, and even that Dr. Germain may well be a bit trigger-happy in snuffing out the life of the new-born (anxiety attacks concerning the mother's life which are a product of his past: the death of his wife in childbirth, which led him to give up his practice as a brain surgeon to become a gynecologist). Indeed, the dirty little truth about "life together" (in French, "la cohabitation")is that it's a precarious and unstable equilibrium requiring us to keep our mouths shut for much of the time about what we know. So "truth" and "cohabitation" are at odds, and that tension has the potential to generate explosive situations which reveal human beings at their worst: namely, self-centered, petty individuals who care not a wit what harm they do as long as they can satisfy their desire to vent their disdain and resentment towards others. The vision of the world in Clouzot's film does not exactly inspire a call to action to make the world a better place to live in. On the other hand, Clouzot may well have believed that we must know the world in all its wretchedness if we wish to change it for the better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Famous French Classic Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was produced while the Nazi's occupied France in 1943 and was financed by the Germans. After the war with Germany, France was very upset with the film and would not allow it to be shown. However, as we know today, it has become a great French film classic and has many awards. This film was considered a mystery thriller, with a person writing poison pen letters under the name Le Corbeau (English Translation: The Raven) Most of these poison pen letters were written to all the towns people and told of many dark secrets they were hiding. One person was in a hospital which was numbered # 13 and wanted desperately to change his bed because it was bad luck. All kinds of problems resulted from these letters signed by the Raven and before you know it, this story becomes a mystery that seems to never end. Great film to view and enjoy, try to view it some time on late time TV.</fullReview>

The poorly-focused quality (typical for copies of this film?), combined with high contrast give it a surreal appearance. The story is of profound cruelty. The misanthropy of a few is distributed effectively (via hundred of poison pen letters) among the many, working to provoke suspicion, persecution, suicide and revenge. This film brings back memories of other horror films of spreading malaise (Night of the Living Dead, eg), but is all the more effective because there is nothing supernatural at work....only the darkness of the human heart....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A French village doctor becomes target of poison-pen letters sent to village leaders, accusing him of affairs and practicing abortion.The film caused serious problems for its director after World War II as it had been produced by Continental Films, a German production company established near the beginning of the Occupation of France, and because the film had been perceived by the underground and the Communist press as vilifying the French people. Because of this, Clouzot was initially blocked for life from directing in France and the film too was suppressed, although both bans only lasted until 1947.I wonder how that works... you're a director in World War II. Your country is taken over by the Germans. Do you work with them to keep working, or do you stop working... or just go underground? Frankly, I'm surprised that Germany allowed the French to make films at all. You might think there would be more important things to do while occupying a country. But then again, Hollywood never let a war slow them down... (not really a fair analogy given that not once has Hollywood been under assault).</fullReview>

It's quite a good way of getting to people. New doctor in town Pierre Fresnay (le docteur Remy) seems to be the main target and the audience begin to question his past as he doesn't seem to have a good record when it comes to performing abortions. We are taken through a cast of characters who are related to each other or having affairs and can you guess the culprit? I found some of the relationships confusing so pay attention or you may get relatives and girlfriends mixed up as I did. The cast are good and we get a varied selection of characters. You'll definitely change your mind as to who is the guilty party even if you do eventually guess correctly. There is also a twist at the end, which you may also guess as the clues are there for you. It doesn't matter though as I found things resolved in a refreshingly satisfying way. Hollywood at the time wouldn't have let this ending pass so the film scores points for that.The film delivers some tense scenes, eg, the funeral and fate of nurse Helena Manson (Marie) ? it's quite an overbearing sequence ? and some humorous moments, eg, the dictation that takes forever. It's the exam from hell that never finishes. You just keep going. Ha ha. The dialogue is good and my favourite of the cast is the village tart Ginette Leclerc (Denise). It's an absorbing film and I know people blab on about some sort of significance in relation to freedom and the Nazi party, but it is basically an entertaining story and can be watched as precisely that without reading in anything else to the proceedings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A controversial practice, for a controversial time, from a controversial director ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In French, the 'crow' is a bird reference defining an anonymous letter sender, generally, poison pen letters, meant to denounce someone or to threaten him. Henri-George Clouzot's "The Crow" is based on a true story that occurred in Tulle, in 1917, a small town in the middle of France. Albeit the origin is true, "The Crow" takes place in a small town "like any other", anywhere in France, it couldn't occult the fact that the practice became very popular during the German occupation, when many French people, claiming to be 'good citizens' or only making their duty, denounced Jews, resistant or relatives to the local Police. "The Crow" was released in 1942, during the occupation, like another French masterpiece "Children of Paradise", but while the context hardly impacted the content of Carné's film, it would be difficult to overlook it for Clouzot, a controversial practice for a controversial time.The film opens with Docteur Remi Germain (Pierre Fresnay) a no-nonsense hardly smiling man, an unusual choice for a lead but another proof that Clouzot is beyond archetypes. Germain doesn't like children but lives in a school director's house, which is not his first paradox, he's very professional with his patients yet indulge himself to some displays of friendship with the beautiful Laura Vorzet (Micheline Francey), the wife of the elderly psychiatrist doctor, played by Pierre Larquay. Laura's sister, an unpleasant and unattractive nurse suspects something going between them and shows it through her constant hostility toward Germain. To complete the picture, the school director's daughter Denise (Ginette Leclerc) and town's slut, is in love with German but can't stand the way he ignores her. In ten minutes, we are familiar with most of the protagonists and the range of suspicions is very wide as soon as the first of the several anonymous letters turn the peaceful town's life into a terrifying witch hunt. The letter accuses Germain of practicing abortions and having illegitimate relations with the doctor's wife. Anyone could have written it as suggests one of the film's most delightful scene. The sympathetic Larquay, remarkably contrasting with Fresnay's coldness, enumerates all the possibilities: it could be anyone. Then, before he leaves, Fresnay asks him the question that tickles our mind: "for all we know, it could be you", to which the doctor responds "possible", as a mystery the film has a sort of Agatha Christie feeling. When everybody is suspect, there are chances not everyone would be truly 'innocent'.And then we touch the controversial core of the film. Clouzot has often been blamed for portraying unsympathetic characters, I won't be the devil's advocate, but I guess I understand why this criticism is often expressed. Clouzot has an extraordinary talent to explore the darkest sides of the human soul: jealousy, envy, greed, lust and much more hypocrisy. Remember Jo in" Wages of Fear" playing tough during the first act before revealing his cowardice, in "The Crow", people are not unsympathetic, but the letters that denounced them awaken defensive and egoistical reactions. "The Crow" is built like a mystery but resonates like a profound and subversive commentary of the methods and practices that prevailed and that inspired the worst from good citizens.Yet the ambiguity remains because while everybody is suspect, everybody is also victim of these accusations when letters start being sent to all the population, when everyone is both an accuser and accused. The cheaters, the cuckold, the sluts, the upstarts, they're all denounced, and sometimes the subject is treated with less gravity and more comedy, like when the Postmaster takes a letter for his wife, a gesture that doesn't fool his employees. The Crow opened a Pandora box that can be paralleled with the presence of Germans in France, with the growing paranoia and suspicion effect applying to everyone. "The Crow" even shares a similarity with the Nazi's black eagle, a bad omen for the population. But even this conclusion is debatable, the Occupation is never mentioned, the story could take place in the mid 30's as well, but it was considered Anti-French, in the way it was vilifying the population, but Anti-French in the 40's can be a good reason to see it with more positive eyes a few years later. Except Clouzot produced it with a German-owned company, and the film features an unforgettable scene set in a classroom, when Dr Larquay swings a lamp that lights a globe, putting light and shadow in different parts of the room, in order to expose the ambivalence of the world, what is exactly right, or what is wrong is a matter of perception. This kind of cynical speech can also serve as an alibi for the detractors until the very ending of the film gives another resonance to the scene. As usual with Clouzot, the most memorable moments of his films happen to be the most controversial. And the controversy surrounding "The Crow" is understandable as long as it doesn't overlook the remarkable direction of the film that transcends the intelligence and subversiveness of its screenplay, foreshadowing more great movies to come. Henri-George Clouzot also demonstrates his unique talent with moves about everyday people trapped in extraordinary situations: doctor, magistrate, cops, housewives, teachers, janitors. Pierre Fresnay, the Captain from "Grand Illusion" is again perfect as the doctor Remi Germain but the scene-stealer remains Larquay with his inimitable voice and intelligent analysis and Ginette Leclerc as a good-hearted and femme fatale-like Danielle. I use the word because the film has often been labeled as the first film noir of French cinema along with "Quai des Brumes", maybe it is true in the way it echoes the 'darkest' and most inclined to pessimism period of French history, it makes "The Crow" even more historically and culturally significant anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Crime Film, Highly Intelligent As Usual from Clouzot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brilliantly shot black-and-white drama &amp; whodunnit that will keep you guessing until the last few scenes, while the final scene itself will likely manage to catch you by surprise as well. Considering that the movie is exactly 70 years old as I write this review, its quality particularly in terms of cinematography, screenplay and the actors' performances is stunning. The black-and-white photography by Nicolas Hayer is eye-popping throughout; wonderful plays of shadows versus light; beautiful small-town street scenes from the French province, meant to suggest a universal environment; ironically, it helps to this end that the movie was made during the German occupation of France: the environment seems fully sterile; you somehow feel, while watching _Le Corbeau_, that something just "isn't right" in the France as it is depicted here; you can almost feel the director Clouzot treading very carefully so as not to fall foul with his (German) censors. However, this does not in the least diminish the movie's artistic merits. Clouzot is often rightfully compared to Hitchcock; they are both supreme, equal masters of the art of suspense. Now, if you're an admirer of, for example, the classic Hitchcock blockbuster _Shadow of a Doubt_, released only a year after _Le Corbeau_, you owe it to yourself to watch _Le Corbeau_ as well; the atmosphere and quality of photography and screenplay (authored by Henri Chavance and Clouzot here) is similar in both movies, and perhaps even some of the characters, such as that of the teenage girl. While _Le Corbeau_ can't quite compete with Clouzot's finest masterpieces such as _Le Salaire de la peur_ and _Les Diaboliques_, it's definitely a first-rate cinematic experience and should be part of any library of classic world cinema. (You might even say it gave birth to the entire "film noir" genre.)</fullReview>

I was even more impressed when I learned more about the history of the film. Made while France was under occupation by the Nazis, the theme of neighbor turning against neighbor takes on an even deeper and more chilling context. A film with no hero and many villains, it is challenging, well acted and physically beautiful. How sadly ironic that film-maker Clouzot was castigated after the war for being a Nazi collaborator for making the film under the thumb of the Nazis (who, of course, controlled the French film industry at the time), when this is about as clearly an anti-collaborationist film as one could imagine. I'm amazed the Nazis didn't stop it's release, much less that they financed it. This is truly subversive cinema at its finest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here comes The Raven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was familiar with two of Henri-Georges Clouzot's (1907-1977) most celebrated films, 'The Wages of Fear' (1953), and 'Les Diaboliques' (1955), both of which I love. Only recently I learned about and watched the controversial and equally brilliant 'Le Corbeau' (1943, aka 'The Raven').'Le Corbeau' is an unusual film; still unsettling and thought-provoking almost seventy years after its initial release. The plot, loosely based on a true story that happened two decades earlier, basically revolves around a series of poison-pen letters written by a mysterious person who signs as 'The Raven'. The letters spread rumors in a small French village, turning the inhabitants against one another, and focus on accusing the local doctor, Remy Germain (Pierre Fresnay), of having an affair and practicing illegal abortions. Releasing such a film (produced by a German company, Continental Films) in France during World War II proved to be quite dangerous, as it was banned after the Liberation (1944), and had its director and some of its stars judged for collaboration with the Germans/banned from their profession.By watching this film for the first time, even now in 2011, one can easily see why it caused such a stir during the War. 'Le Corbeau' is allegorical cinema at its finest; although the symbolism present in the apparently simple plot can be interpreted in a myriad of ways - there lies the richness of great art - it is not hard to see the brilliant analysis of a community's paranoia in times of war. In a way, it reminds me of Don Siegel's classic 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' (1956) and its indictment of McCarthyism, behind the apparently cheesy sci-fi facade.Films, like any other art form (when/whether they achieve the level of art or not is another story altogether), are products of their time. Some age well, others don't; yet they remain a relevant document of the period they represent. 'Le Corbeau' not only has aged very well, but still holds the intellectual punch it did 68 years ago. Today's relative lack of censorship has killed subtlety in film for the most part. Modern satires often rely on shock value, visual and mental masturbation in order to provoke the audience. One of the most memorable scenes in 'Le Corbeau', for me, is the one in which a little girl desperately states her wish to die after finding out (through a poison-pen letter) that she is an illegitimate child. It strikes me as a poignant and yet so disturbingly real scene that you rarely see in films today (we're not talking the seductive prose and visual feast of 'The Virgin Suicides', but a dead serious representation of a child's desperation among adults going insane); let alone back in 1943. 'Le Corbeau' was and remains a brave film; a truly original, intriguing, timeless piece of cinema, and I'm glad I've finally discovered it. Regardless of the viewer's approach - as a mystery, a satire, a peculiar melodrama - it is sure to make one think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fell in love. This film is so damn good it hurts, especially compared to the majority of English language films of the '40s.It's difficult to add much to the comments already made on this classic film (without writing a book on it), and I agree wholeheartedly with the praise it receives.The cinematography is beautiful, the writing is sharp and tight, the cast is superb and from beginning to end it's gripping and intense.I seem to have reacted differently to many on one point, however. Reading through the other comments, I see a plethora of words like dark, misanthropic, disturbing, grim, depressing....Personally, I spent much of this film chuckling to myself (quietly, so I didn't miss a single line of dialogue), gleefully revelling in the wonderfully mordant comedy which lurks just beneath the surface.Does it really present a negative view of people? I would say not. The film states emphatically, over and over, that everyone has faults and flaws.Denise sleeps around. Laura want to, but can't. Rolande misappropriates funds from the post office. Marie Corbin filches morphine from the hospital. Rémy, our protagonist, is an abortionist (and in a Catholic country to boot!).Town officials fill their pockets, drink and doze and dally while they should be working, have affairs and act... like humans.Not evil - flawed. Denise want to be respected. Laura wants to be loved. Rolande wants to live the good life. Marie is fiercely loyal. Rémy is a passionate doctor who acts according to his beliefs.To me, not even "le Corbeau" himself was wholly evil. Vorzet's actions are certainly evil, and their results tragic and catastrophic, but his insanity is pointed out as coolly as the foibles of the other characters. By the good doctor himself, which is a nice touch... one which made me laugh at the end, looking back on the jovial commentary he provides throughout the film.The humour is certainly on the dark side - and somewhat obscured by the emotional impact of the characters and the impetus of the story - but I found that at the heart of the film's darkness is a fundamental affirmation that life is a complex tapestry of good and bad, selfish and altruistic.Nobody is all good or all bad. I honestly believe that. To say so isn't misanthropic or negative - it's just a fact. Neither does such a view condone selfish or destructive behaviour; rather, I would say, it implies a degree of awareness (whether observational or personal) which is more likely to discourage than encourage.After all, if a person doesn't see their own faults, how can they deal with them? Compared to many films (not just of its own era), this is a morally complex tale. It treats all of its characters - from Rémy Germain and "la m?re du cancéreux" to Vorzet himself - with a delicacy and sympathy which is unusual and moving.The fact that it's also bitingly satirical and viscerally intense... well, that's just a bonus!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are thrillers, and then there is this; stranger still, that it came out of German occupied France (makes sense for the subject, but not how it got through the censors). Henri-Georges Clouzot's "Le Corbeau" is about a small town under the oppressive, but anonymous, watch of "The Raven," an almost sadistic poison-letter writer who upturns the entire community with his or her block-letter revelations into everyone's secret lives. At the center of the drama is a surgeon named Germain, who is the target of most of The Raven's wrath. As Germain attempts to clear preserve his livelihood, his (typically) sordid past will be revealed, the worst of the town will be brought out, and even some people will die.The tone of the film is perfect. Even after it becomes obvious who The Raven actually is (it took me until about fifteen minutes before the end, but I'm sure wary viewers will know earlier), the climate of fear and distrust is the true dramatic impulse of the film. People mistrust each other not just because of what The Raven reveals, or wondering who he or she is, but because of their own role in the evils that become suddenly upturned like weeds left along a cobbled street.There is also another element at work which I wouldn't call surrealism, but projects a sense of spirits, ghosts, and dream at work. The illusions of the community are such that not only is the happy facade removed, but it's replaced entirely behind a cloak of darkness. Characters' lives become represented by broken mirrors, swinging lamps, and swinging doors, yet never is that the full symbolic act of their being.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a chilling mystery where psychology and sociological perspectives are a little more of the dramatic juice than the outcome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henri-Georges Clouzot's Le Corbeau is at once a story loaded with the kind of tension and thrills and dramatic questions that keep an audience guessing like any good mystery, and as well an indictment of the crueler, more paranoid and darker sides to all people. At the time it was looked upon as being quite controversial, namely because it was released at the height of the Nazi occupation in France. The film does have that immense level of accusation (one sometimes thinks of the simple French phrase 'J'accuse!' when watching it) that evil can happen not simply in the realm of fascism and dictatorial agendas of mass murder and control, but in seemingly ordinary folk in towns and villages where an unkind word can spark the worst intentions. Not only does one think of the Nazi occupation in this context, but also the Salem Witch trials, or any time when it's not even about the end result but about getting the task done at hand, to rule out *seeming* evil by the power of fear and corruption. There's even one of the great sequences showing in clear view how emotions can boil over so high where mob-rule becomes demonstrative of a form of sociological ills. We see a funeral taking place- a character from early in the story received a letter from the notorious 'Raven', an anonymous madman who has been spreading gossip about many in town, specifically a doctor Germain, but when this man receives it it drives him to suicide. During this, a letter falls out of the buggy carrying the hearse. First we get a very important set of shots showing how everyone who walks behind the buggy never stops but always glances at the letter addressed in bold to the townspeople. Suddenly one reads it, and an uproar occurs against Mary Corbin. She runs in a frantic pace and mind-set; even as she runs away from what is stirring into a mob out for the simple satisfaction of getting someone in, be they truly guilty or not, and Clouzot never shows us the mob running after her, but keeps the sound rising even higher and higher of people gaining in their angry calls against her. Then a moment when she finds solace in an empty, shattered room, there are still words scribbled on the walls, and finally they catch up to her. It's such a rich sequence in technical-cinematic terms, yet there's also a lot to think about in terms of the nature of the people, of the society at hand- or, as the opening line suggest, any town.Le Corbeau is incisive and questioning of what it means to have not just trust in a town, or a respect for confidence, or really what it means (probably more than anything) of the innocent revealing the guilty where they might be (i.e. the scene where Vorzet and Germain quarter the adults in town to see if their writing styles match the Raven), but also what is compassion or forgiveness or love or any of that which is not really evil. It even does, albeit through a lot of talk- through the old Vorzet played by the great Pierre Larquey- try to examine how the personal intermingles with the professional, and what might seem crazy or stupid gossip is really just as evil as murder. The premise is simple: a doctor (Pierre Fresnay, best known from Grand Illusion) starts getting letters, saying very key words like 'abortionist' and 'liar and fraud'. Of course, once the first part gets out, things start to go haywire in the town, though not until others in the town, including those as high up as the mayor, receive similar terms of "this is what you do in your secret spare-time". It sets off a chain reaction, which also includes Germain having to reveal finally his true dark past- one that reminds the audience that what is hidden should stay that way- but that the women in his life, Laura (the elderly Michel's young husband) and Denise, his on-off love-interest- and a break in Germain's character as at first a shrewd bourgeois and later a man of more emotional depth.But there's more than just Germain's fate and reputation at stake in Le Corbeau, and what gets pointed out about how good people can go ugly, or the power of what SHOULD be chaos and hysteria that can be bought into, or that the old phrase "judge not and ye shall not be judged" could never be more pertinent. This all said, Clouzot's film is not actually as preachy as one might expect from this description. Here and there Vorzet does go on and on, with his manner of speech all too uncanny, but beneath the deep scope of more intellectual and even political agendas there's an engrossing whodunit here as well. At the same time one may be thinking about how this relates to the period and geography of what it was made, it's really just a supremely timed and fascinatingly shot picture meant to appeal to mystery and thriller fans up for something different; only the process is a little more skewed. I'm even a little reminded of the recent film version of the Zodiac story, where the medium of communication from unknown outsider to the mass public and the consequences are far more stronger and with more possibilities realized than the end-result. It's also surely one of the true classics made in France during WW2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bitter realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a faint recollection of this film whose story I know well although I remember sporadically some scenes as women gathering round a letter in an predatory manner and the deformed woman proud for her sexual achievements. The black and white picture gives the blackness of the human heart that Clouzot wants to portray. The fact that he has been criticized is understandable historically though not correct.French resistance is largely a myth that has been perpetuated because the status of France as a great power historically and the special weight of French imperialism made it difficult for the world to accept the simple truth that rural France has been indifferent in the face of the German conqueror as it has been during Sedan when a largely rural parliament voted the Treaty of Francfort.Despite the efforts of ideologues everywhere the nation means little to average people everywhere who continue their petty existence caged in their daily routine and rituals full of envy of the tiny minority that rules them whether it belongs to the same race or religion as them.The fact that villages everywhere are a form of second rate collective experience is portrayed in Clouzot's. The communist Manifesto has stated the idiocy of rural life and I will not consider Clouzot a pessimist but a realist.The second rate life that villagers and small town people live is very well portrayed as well as their morality which is based on the fear of the opinion of their neighbors.Their fear of outsiders also.European conservatism has tried to romanticize rural life as if a life lived under the yoke of priest and seigneur was a happy and fulfilled one! The fact that provincial is pejorative term in most languages says something. As far as France is concerned a country with a long tradition of hierarchy and deference to authority this is important to note.I remember the poem of Kariotakis, a Greek poet about Preveza, a Greek provincial town. The atmosphere of stifling mediocrity is very well portrayed there as in the film. It is a very fine film and a document of social history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First rate suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE RAVEN (Henri-Georges Clouzot - France 1943).Henri Georges Clouzot's Le Corbeau is a well-made highly suspenseful puzzle about a mysterious writer of poison-pen letters, known only as Le Corbeau (The Raven), who plagues a French provincial town, exposing the collective suspicion and rancor seething beneath the community's calm surface. This film is best known for the controversy it stirred regarding Clouzot's wartime association with Continental Films, the notorious German-controlled, vertically integrated "major" that was the dominant force in the era's cinematic production. Continental's head, Alfred Greven,envisioned the company as a European version of MGM, with himself as an Aryan version of Louis B. Mayer during France's wartime occupation by the Germans. Though propaganda minster Joseph Goebbels increasingly saw Continental as an instrument for producing mindless propaganda, Greven wanted to make quality works, films of real artistic ambition, of which Le Corbeau is an excellent example. Curiously enough, in the South, under the Vichy-regime, censorship was much tougher when it came to films than in the occupied parts of France. Most films in Vichy-France were produced solely to support their Travail, Famille, Patrie ideology, and most of them are forgotten, a cinematic legacy much less interesting than the one left by the relatively free-spirited Alfred Greven and his Continental Films.Le Corbeau didn't receive a warm reception when it came out and was condemned by practically every authority imaginable. The Germans condemned the film for it supposedly attacked anonymous letters and anonymous information in general, or better put, snitching, something the Germans needed badly in their efforts fighting French resistance. After the liberation, the film was banned and Clouzot himself was accused of collaborating with the Germans and banned from film-making for two years in his native France. Luckliy it didn't discourage him and he was able to rehabilitate himself and made many more unforgettable films. Though not as well known as Henri-Georges Clouzot's later films, WAGES OF FEAR (1953) or LES DIABOLIQUES (1955), it is in many ways a precursor of LES DIABOLIQUES, wherein the provincial French town is replaced by a boarding school as the background and central framework of characters, where everyone is a potential suspect. To a certain respect this film can be read as a social commentary on small-town values in France, of mocking provincial French society, but it mostly serves as Clouzot's deeply pessimistic view of mankind. The town's inhabitants seem to have nothing but spite and hatred and share a deep distrust of one another. Dr. Remy Germain (Pierre Fresnay), the town's doctor, who forms the central figure in the poison-pen letters scandal, is unsympathetic and hateful and carries some kind of mystery from his past. Most of Clouzot's sympathy seems to lie with Denise Saillens (Ginette Leclerc in a great role), as his bed-ridden patient and former lover, who forms the most tragic and ambivalent character in the film. Clouzot skilfully manipulates the viewer and portrays her simultaneously as a helpless victim and a heartless vamp. The film stays with the central story most of the time and is filled with nail-biting suspense till the very end. Right until the film's closing shot through the window when Dr. Germain watches the clothed woman walking down the street, we come frustratingly close to the Raven's identity but Clouzot leaves all options open. Was it Denise? Was it Laura Vorzet? Wsa it Dr. Michel Vorzet? Or were they all, at least partly, responsible? The answer is ours.Criterion's DVD-release presents the film in a very acceptable transfer. With the extras though, they dropped a bullock. There's a potentially interesting interview with Bertrand Tavernier, who recently made the film "Safe Conduct" about Continental and French wartime cinema. Regretabbly, Tavernier talks in English with such a heavy accent it was virtually indecipherable to me (there were no subtitles either, English or French), a waste of time. Also included is an 8 min. excerpt from a 1975 documentary "The Story of French Cinema by Those Who Made It: Grand Illusions 1939-1942." The excerpt ends abruptly, practically in the middle of an interview, probably because the rest is not primarily about Le Corbeau or Clouzot, but I figure it was included in the first place to shed light on French cinema in general during the German occupation. Now it looks displaced and out of context. They should have included the whole documentary (which is about an hour?) or leave it out altogether. A real waste that is completely unnecessary. Two potentially interesting extras, that add up to very little in this form. Criterion should do better with their heftily priced DVD's. Camera Obscura --- 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Power of Rumors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the small French village of St. Robin a reserved country doctor receives a poison-pen accusing him of practicing abortions to relieve mothers of unwilling burdens. Soon everyone else starts receiving similar letters, accusing each and everyone of dark secrets. Paranoia and mass hysteria set in as people begin spying each other looking for the culprit. Innocents are slandered and persecuted without evidence. Violence ensues, one man commits suicide. And yet the poison-pen letters, always signed by The Raven, continue to arrive.This is a slow, carefully-built suspense movie in which the identity of The Raven isn't important (and for my part the revelation was ultimately disappointing); Henri-Georges Clouzot is more interested in the human drama, in the relationships between the characters, in the way intrigue, rumors, hidden hatreds infect and destroy a community. It's a misanthropic movie, showing how easily people can become irrational and violent and suggesting there's no cure for this, that it is embedded in our nature. Clouzot, working during the Nazi occupation of France, had many reasons to be depressed about Mankind.As the study of a community it is interesting. As a thriller I found it dull. Many of the qualities that made me enjoy his other thriller Les Diaboliques is also here, but something didn't click for me. The ending, the moralist punishment of The Raven, seemed so rushed and contrary to the rest of this bleak movie, that I wonder if Clouzot was forced to put it there. I had the same feeling about Les Diaboliques.Slow and sometimes dull, it's an interesting thriller, but not one I'd like to watch again any time soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remarkable film made moreso by the remarkable circumstances under which it was produced. But don't let that scare you off, this is not a mere exercise in historical enlightenment, but rather a mirror for the darkening that comes with hysteria. This is truly a film that speaks beyond the (six so far) decades. For instance, the dialog in this unlike too many older films, moves at a quick clip. Additionally the unspoken conversation, that between the storyteller and the audience, is not so obvious as to bore the modern viewer. Indeed that is likely as Clouzot had to cloak his message from the occupying German censors (and perhaps from some of his misguided countrymen as well?) To help distract them, he provides a visually captivating film, camera ables that lurch, leer and take to the air. Even the black and white nature of this masterpiece serves to underscore the decidedly *not* black and white nature of the crimes therein. As suspects shift, the whodunnit turns into more of a whywedunnit.And it covers some of our less noble whatwedunnits too. Adultery, abortion, drug abuse, political corruption, typically these are used today to try and tar and feather the other political party before they can do the same. The crimes are seemingly shared by all, but then why this mad race to pen the first poison letter, again and again.Is the American Eagle really Le Corbeau in disguise? Do we have nothing to merchandise but fear itself?No, I don't want to really believe that, but this is an outstanding film that can raise larger questions from the past and the future; as easily as it can be enjoyed as an entertaining suspense story.9/10Thurston Hunger</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent classic French thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*****CONTAINS SPOILERS***** Having seen Les Diaboliques before this thriller from Clouzot I expected that Le Corbeau could not match Les Diaboliques. And it didn't but it was not far off. But remember that Le Corbeau was the second movie directed by Clouzot and made 12 years before Les Diaboliques. So he had some time to perfect his skills.The movie manages to hide the identity of the writer of the poison-pen letters to the very end although there are hints during the movie and these are even mentioned by the perpetrator himself. One uneasy fact of the story is the quite amicable relation the writer of the letters has with the main character of the movie (Remy) who happens to have a more than friendly relation with the wife of the writer. Creating the illusion that he doesn't mind this because of the age difference between him and his wife, he sets out to destroy Remy (Remy in the meanwhile also becomes the lover of another woman). While doing this he is responsible for the death of a patient, nearly destroys his ex-fiancée who happens to be the sister of his wife but also his supplier of Morphine and spills the beans on a lot of people in the village. Indeed quite a devious but still amicable person. But he finds his end at the hands of a grieving mother and that is how the movie ends leaving the viewer to wonder what Remy would do: report her or not?What is interesting about this movie that it was made during WWII when France was occupied by the Germans. The movie was made for a German film company and it landed Clouzot a ban on making movies for a few years after WWII. The movie was denounced by the French resistance and the German occupiers did not endorse it. My interpretation is that Clouzot managed to make a thriller with a hidden message: that in times of trouble (war) no one is to be trusted and that the one who is to be distrusted the most is the one you least expect it of. I think it was a message to people to be very careful because no secret remains hidden and informers are everywhere. And to be careful for scapegoating. Anyway, that is my interpretation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Deadpan Creepiness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>H.G. Clouzot, who would later direct Les Diaboliques and The Wages of Fear, two very intense and superbly done thrillers, creates a very creepy small town ambiance, similar to that of Les Diaboliques. Perhaps this is his trademark, his dark influence that makes his thrillers so spooky and effective. For a film about poison pen letters in an insular French town, that is exactly the sort of direction needed.Very fine performances are drawn from earthy, subtle Pierre Fresnay, whose tense inner feelings slowly crescendo, and darkly charming Ginette Leclerce, a sexy, enigmatic 1940s femme. The deadpan movement of the film and its powerful final shot are the highlights of this good early film of Clouzot's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great set-up, but things do tend to slow down -- still, the ending's fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderful set-up and a delightful cast engage us fully but because the characters are reacting to an initially off-screen protagonist, and there's some lax plotting near the end, the film fizzles a bit before its (mostly) satisfying conclusion. A more purposeful attempt by the main character, a doctor, or anyone to solve the mystery of the poisonous letters would streamline the action somewhat and save us from the serendipitous action of randomly arriving missives. The two-pronged solution to the mystery is just barely acceptable, but the characters involved are so sympathetic we'll take it as served.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fine, Feathered Friend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After establishing a small, bleak town the camera moves to open farmland before closing in on three old crones. After a moment a man emerges from a building with bloody hands which he proceeds to wash in a bucket. If this makes you think of Macbeth you're either 1) reasonably erudite, 2) the kind of academic incapable of saying a given film is good, bad, or indifferent without masking opinion beneath layers of jargon - diegesis, semiology, metonymic, semioclasm, syntagma, morpheme, etc -, 3) the kind of person who ENJOYS reading that kind of academic or 4) Me, an ordinary Joe who read a book once and can't quite get over it. In his great play 'The Big Knife' Clifford Odets had leading character Charley Cass say "Macbeth is an allegory, one by one he kills his better selves" and if we pursue my Scottish play analogy we could argue that the Raven's poison pen is killing the townspeople's better selves in a similar fashion. It was, of course, Lady Macbeth who felt compelled to wash the blood off her hands but in St Robin the blood is definitely on the hands of Dr Germain (Pierre Fresnay) both physically as in the opening scene where the blood belongs to a woman patient and metaphorically when, by remaining aloof and indifferent to the accusations of which he is in part guilty, he encourages the Raven to continue the campaign until very real deaths occur. This is a great film any way you look at it and the fact that there are so many ways to do so only adds to its appeal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective Mystery Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This early Clouzot outing benefits from a much more plausible plot than some of his later films like Les Diaboliques.The plot deals with subject matter of universal appeal: the poisonous atmosphere of gossip, rumour and suspicion that frequently arises in small towns, in this case through the actions of a writer of "poison pen" letters.As a thriller, the film works well with multiple possible suspects each having opportunities to write the letters. Each character's facade is pulled back in turn. The limited number of locations are well-utilised and the film builds slowly towards its climax. Indeed, Clouzot's reputation as "the French Hitchcock" is well-justified by the outing.The acting is strong though not exceptional but it does convey the growing paranoia as the insular town-folk turn on visitors from outside and then on each other as their secrets are exposed, even in the sanctity of the local church.Ultimately this film, like Hitchcock's, tends to lack depth. It is a serviceable thriller that keeps the audience guessing as to the identity of the writer but does little more than expose the pettiness and tawdriness of the lives of people who live in small country towns. This lack of greater depth keeps the film from being one of the true masterpieces of French cinema yet it remains an effective exercise in cinematic technique.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, for the most part, an interesting little movie that explores how a series of anonymous poison pen letters tear a town apart. The idea is intriguing, there are some notable scenes, as in one where the town turns on someone they think is responsible, and the movie does a good job of throwing suspicion on various people.At the same time, the movie often has a sameness to it. Still, I would have rated it higher if the denouement had been solid. But it actually feels random. I just didn't believe the ending. As a study of growing hysteria in a small town, this is a pretty good movie. But it also sets itself up as a mystery, and as a mystery it is a dismal failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For get the reputation and overtones to the Occupation, this is just a good thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henri-Georges Clouzot's tale of the trouble an unending series of poison pen letters causes in a small village is a solid little thriller. The tale of letters signed Le Corbeau revealing all the well hidden secrets of a country village has been hailed as a great classic, I'm not sure I would go that far, but it is a good thriller. I think the fact that the film was made in occupied France and was reviled by both the occupiers and the occupied, not to mention its banning after the war, has inflated its reputation needlessly. Its a good film, certainly it has been rightly called one of the first film noirs, but I can't say thats its much more than that. I think its importance past entertainment has been overstated (especially in retrospect). for me its a good little mystery, anything else is hyperbole. Worth a look for those looking for a good thriller.</fullReview>
