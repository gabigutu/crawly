		<shortDescription>Effective and Uneasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is something like a full-length episode of the Twilight Zone, popular at the time of the movie's release. It's cheaply made, the photography is grainy, the story basically simple, and the acting nothing to write home about -- but this is one effective film if you're into dread.Candace Hilligoss is a pretty blonde with a sharp nose and a vulnerable quality about her. (She might remind the viewer of that Twilight Zone episode that starred Inger Stevens continually running into a guy in black, "The Hitch Hiker," maybe?) Candace Hilligoss is not a major actress but it's difficult to imagine a better fit between the individual and the role. She's pretty enough so that men might find it pleasant to stand next to her in the supermarket checkout line, but not too pretty. Her face is defined by its bone structure so that you can almost see the skull beneat the skin. Her slanted, over-sized blue eyes suggest some sort of startled prey animal. And her movements, her body language, are both clumsy and extremely feminine. She wobbles when she runs and minces when she walks. And she's the right age too -- thirtyish -- not a fledgling with a great big Future ahead of her. The successive loss of her friends, her home town, her job in Utah, her room in the boarding house, and eventually her car, is enough to leave anyone in a state of desperation -- especially someone whose sole marketable skill seems to be playing the organ. The narrative has been gone over so I'll skip any description of it. What distinguishes this movie from others of its type is that, with the exception of the opening scenes of the accident at the bridge, there is no one at all who acts in a perfectly normal manner. (Unlike Inger Stevens, Hilligos has no ordinary sailor to pick up and talk to.) The pervading sense of disquiet is enhanced by the efficient use of locations -- a church, a vast ballroom, a decrepit and deserted amusement park at the end of a pier. And I think the performers contribute as well, their very amateurish awkwardness promoting in the viewer a feeling that "something" is not quite right about what we're witnessing. Even the scenes of quotidian life -- finding a job, fending off a neighbor's advances, trying to be polite to a polite landlady -- seem to be imbued with a kind of hard-to-define cockeyed quality, as in a De Chirico painting. Hilligoss is living in a universe in which nothing, and nobody, has an identity whose validity can be taken for granted. Not even her psychiatrist can be trusted to be what he seems. There are no big shock moments. Nobody gets slaughtered in a shower. Nothing is "evil" in any ordinary sense. Everything is simply "wrong." And the only music in the score is played on a church organ, mostly eerie chords that shimmer in the background. It's quietly done by director Herk Harvey.Sidney Berger, who plays Hilligoss's odd neighbor, was in real life a speech instructor at the nearby University of Kansas. The leader of the dead is played by the director. This weird, subdued piece comes to us out of Lawrence, Kansas. It's pretty good for Lawrence, Kansas. But don't set your expectations too high. It's an old black-and-white horror movie, made by amateurs on a minescule budget. But within the limits set by those conditions, it's pretty good for anywhere, for that matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Resourceful Modest Budget Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After viewing this legendary flick for the first time, I have to say that the quality they achieved on a shoestring is still impressive today. Every penny spent on this little film makes its way before the viewer, which is something that can't be said of most major budget films then or now. Corman used "getting the money up on the screen" as his yardstick for his own success as low budget producer and director. But while I like the Corman cheapies, like Bucket of Blood and Little Shop of Horrors, and acknowledge that they possess a relatively high level of workman-like resourcefulness, it's hard to deny that Carnival makes many of Corman's films look slapped-out and unimaginative in comparison. Corman usually steered clear of anything poetic, dabbling with it most pointedly in the dream sequences in his first Poe adaptations. In contrast, this films makers are quoted to the effect that they were inspired by Bergman and Cocteau. Now, with such heroic ambition, Carnival could have turned out a laughable mess. But the films dark waking dream atmosphere is well realized. They had some really great locations? the pavilion, the wooden bridge, the organ factory and the church with the "casting out demons" stained glass. The actress playing the heroine is lucky (or skillful) casting, too; she doesn't look or act quite like the average person, which is perfect for the story. If I picked one thing to complain about, it would be the interlude with the guy from across the hall in the rooming house, about the writing of that section and especially about the actor who played him. But I won't. There's just too much good to be said about this small masterpiece of independent film making.Ten stars. See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Semi-Forgotten Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not many people know of this film, surprisingly--this is one of the most intelligently constructed and atmospheric horror (for lack of a better term) movies of all time. Whenever I do run across someone else who has seen this film, there is an instantaneous, unspoken understanding in regards to the enduring creepiness of this film.My first viewing of COS occurred when I had inexplicably awoke in the middle of the night as a boy and switched on the TV. I had missed the opening minutes, but was powerfully drawn into the story. I sat transfixed until the shock ending, and think I just stared until after the sign off and following screen static. The next day I was not entirely sure I had actually watched this film or dreamed it--nobody else had ever heard of it and I never did catch the title (for some reason, its never shown much). Needless to say I was creeped out for days! Films that can affect one's sensibilities like this are golden! Find it and watch it in the middle of the night--alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The problem with rediscovery at the hands of distributors like Criterion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The unexpected popularity that sneaks up on movies like 'Carnival of Souls' is a double-edged sword. The positive aspects, of course, are renewed interest in undeservedly forgotten and neglected gems, as well as gloriously informative 2-disc DVD editions put out by Criterion. The negative result, however, is that the glowing aura created by the excitement and publicity of rediscovery often outshines the actual value of the given film, leaving one feeling underwhelmed.This happened for me with 'Carnival of Souls,' which is undeniably a film that has a creepy and eerie effect, but is also a film that is slight and does not stand up against the reputation that now precedes it. Movies like this work best when encountered casually on television late at night, where one might be blindsided by its hypnotic pull. When one goes to it after having read adjectives like "creepy" and "eerie" applied to it, the movie is confronted by expectations which are likely to be disappointed. And while the Criterion edition offers an insanely satisfying cache of supplements, having access to materials such as interviews with director Herk Harvey, detailed backstory, production stills, advertising materials, and television documentaries on the film and on the current condition of the locations used offers a sense of comfort and reassurance that destroys the movie's mystique.The paper-thin story follows a young church organist named Mary who survives a nasty car wreck and leaves town to take a job in Utah, where she lodges in a boarding house and fends off the aggressive advances of her across-the-hall neighbor. Strange things begin happening to Mary. She is haunted by visions of a ghastly-looking stranger, is entranced by a decaying nearby bathhouse/carnival grounds long abandoned, and experiences inexplicable episodes where sounds of the outside world are suddenly muted and others fail to notice or respond to her.The movie's most notable attribute is its skill in establishing atmosphere and a sense of dread. Yet, there's no payoff, and while that's okay, the movie is modest and, at 78 minutes (or 83, if you're watching the director's cut), rather short. If you come to this movie from a position of curiosity, there's a danger of being left with a "that's it?" sort of feeling.The element I found most intriguing was the pointed passivity of the Mary character. Indifferent to her job and to those around her, Mary is completely detached, and the movie very nearly becomes a character study of a schizoid personality. Surprisingly, the parts that were most engaging for me involved Mary's across-the-hall neighbor, a man named John Linden who is alcoholic, persistent, and very, very horny. Linden's scenes all entail his trying to get into Mary's pants, and he is almost jarringly sexually coercive -- a rapist in the making. Screenwriter John Clifford and actor Sidney Bergen invest this character with an unexpected degree of dimension. If the movie obviously foretells Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead,' it also hints at 'Repulsion.'There are a great many tasty lost artifacts from the prime of drive-in fare and B-movies, some of which get ostentatiously found and marketed as cult films, thus depriving one of the pleasure of personal discovery. The less you know about 'Carnival of Souls' before viewing it, the more likely you are to enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning horror masterpiece that overcomes it limitations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is so engaging that you manage to overlook the flaws while you're watching it. Sure some of the acting and editing are below par, but you don't realize that fact until after the film is done. During viewing you get caught up with the story, and Hillgoss' performance. Mary didn't have to be multi-dimension, but Hillgoss' performance makes her so. She is cold, alone, and isolated from the world. She has no friends, and doesn't feel the need for any. Despite the coldness of her character, you feel sympathetic for her and even begin to hope she gets out okay. Due to her lack of companionship, she eventually turns to the chauvinistic man who lives across from her. This is another interesting character, one who obviously lusts for Mary but doesn't know how to express his feelings, and it seems if it wasn't for the censorship at the time, he could've become more fleshed out. As another reviewer noted, he is obviously on the verge of rape and is emotionally abusive.The story is simple, yet it grabs you by the throat and refuses to give up until the film is over. A woman bizarrely comes out of water three hours after an accident occurred. How did this happen? As she tries to get away as far as possible from the incident, strange events continuously occur and she finds herself drawn mysteriously to an abandoned carnival. Also, a strange specter appears constantly. Is this a human stalking Mary? Or is it something supernatural or of the psyche? No one else can see him. Things continue to get worse and worse, and many times Mary is unable to communicate or hear the people around her, yet strangely it goes back to normal within moments. The film's ending is slightly predictable, but suiting. Something more flashy would've destroyed the feel.As many have noted, this isn't a technically flawless film. But you get so sucked in by the film it isn't until the ending that you realize some of the flaws. For one the editing isn't the greatest, but you must remember that the crew had an obscenely low budget to work with. It wasn't for lack of talent, it was for lack of resources. Also some of the supporting actors aren't very good, but again the film is so low-budget that it would've been impossible to pay better performers. Did you really expect to see Oscar winners in a b-film anyways? There are several aspects that easily trump the mild flaws. For one, the camera work is incredible, on par with many Hollywood films. The angles of the organ were particularly affecting, and the upward shots of the ghouls gave you the feeling of helplessness that Mary feels. Also, Hillgoss' performance is, as I stated above, very good. She manages to make a cold and isolated character human and sympathetic instead of the cardboard stereotype that haunts most films of the nature. The actor who plays the neighbor isn't the best, but his character is certainly interesting, a perverted peeping tom that if the film had been made ten years later would've surely been more developed. Also, the crudeness of the acting adds to the feel. Due in fact that Hillgoss provides the only good acting in the film, you get the feeling that something isn't right. The lack of development for almost every other character adds to the dreamlike quality. When was the last time you had a nightmare in which the other people involved where fleshed out.The most impressive aspect is Harvey's direction. He knew how to make something out of absolutely nothing, and it certainly shows. The angles and pacing are some of the film's benefactors. And the dream sequences and sped-up carnival footage are nothing short of breathtaking, showing his masterful Harvey was. It's a shame he never made another film, but than again if you make only one film, why not have it be a masterpiece? "Carnival of Souls" transcends its limitations. It contains no special effects for the most part, and very minimalist makeup. It shows that imagination is what makes a film work, not flashy dynamics and special effects. Due to this, many fans of newer horror films will not appreciate its genius. For fans of cult films and surrealist films will be impressed. The latter camp will be amazed how the film is very avant-garde despite no budget to work with. The film is one of the ultimate cult films. Ignored when it came out, only decades later was it appreciated on its rerelase in 1989. The same thing happened with "Reefer Madness", "Glen or Glenda", and "Spider Baby". That is, in my opinion, is one of the factors that makes a film a cult film, definitely more so than if the film is just a sleeper hit. Even if it didn't have the cult following, this is still a film that must be seen. It never outright scares you, but it gets under your skin. It leaves a lasting impression, and I guarantee you'll not forget it for the rest of your life. (10/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way Ahead of Its Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I don't belong in the world?.something separates me from other people" says Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) in perhaps the most lyrical horror film ever made. It is the unlikely 1962 masterpiece "Carnival of Souls" which philosophically fleshes out the premise of "Twilight Zone's" "The Hitch Hiker" episode (January 1960). The one where Inger Stevens (as Nan Adams) plays a young woman driving cross country who keeps passing the "same" man standing by the side of the road. Its masterpiece quality was unlikely because it was the low budget first feature film of Herk Harvey (a director of educational short films), using actors with little acting for the camera experience, and with a story structure adapted to fit sets and locations to which Harvey had free access.One of these locations was an organ factory. This not only dictated the film's unique and beautiful score but it suggested a profession for the main character (Mary Henry), a church organist. With this they really got lucky because it brings in many disturbing religious images and undertones. A church organist seemingly possessed by her instrument, as her playing alternates between the spiritual and the profane, deeply disturbs her wrapped-too-tight" minister who would have benefited from Pollyanna's advice about the "rejoicing texts". The organ factory also serves nicely for a Carol Reed-type angular shot with the huge organ pipes in the foreground and the diminutive figure of Hilligoss far below. This early shot sets the existential tone for what will follow. Finally, there is the moment when she is alone on the highway and her radio will only pick up organ music.The other location is the abandoned Saltair Pavilion outside Salt Lake City. Much of the story takes place here as Mary Henry is mysteriously drawn to the place. Watch for this shot of her in front of a promotional poster for the Pavilion, on the poster is a look-alike blonde with the same hairstyle. Since the late 19th century, Saltair had been a family swimming/recreational facility built out into the Great Salt Lake. The huge pavilion looks like a strange cross between an Eastern Orthodox church and an Arabian Nights palace. The falling lake level doomed the swimming feature but the place operated as an amusement park until abandoned five years before the filming of "Carnival of Souls". At the time of filming the actual pealing paint, broken glass, collapsed staircases, and general disorder made for a better location than even the best production designer could have constructed. It also works well from a "language of film" symbolic perspective as Mary is shown walking through an unnatural circular passage, which reinforces other subtle off-kilter elements that occur throughout the film.While much of the film's texture was the happy result of the low budget necessity of using these available locations, the casting of Hilligoss worked out even better. Probably cast because she was the most beautiful actress available for the price, Harvey hit a home run because she brings exactly the right sterile and distanced qualities that the film needs in its main character. Hilligoss might have been an acting-for-the-camera novice but she had extensive stage experience. Harvey was able to get an extraordinary nonverbal performance from her, unexpectedly taking the film deep into the concept of human alienation. Much like "The Incredible Shinking Man", with its existential theme of separation from society, "Carnival of Souls" also transcends its genre and explores the isolation of someone who feels they no longer belong. And like "TISM", the resolution is the realization that loss of identity is freedom, that the infinite and the infinitesimal are the same, that you are not alone because you are a part of something bigger.The two occasions where Mary Henry suddenly becomes invisible to everyone are much more vivid because Hilligoss is so beautiful. Unlike a person of average appearance, an especially beautiful woman walking down the street is used to drawing stares from virtually everyone. For such a person the phenomenon of sudden invisibility would be far more jarring than for those who are used to not being noticed in the passing crowd.For budget reasons, egg white was used on the faces of the "dead" cast members, including Harvey himself who plays Mary's recurring apparition. This has an especially eerie effect with black and white film and would be adopted a few years later by George Romero for "Night of the Living Dead".Educational film veteran Frances Feist plays Mary's cherubic landlady and John Linden plays her slimy (on the make) neighbor. Both are excellent, and the disjointed and stilted acting style of their scenes with Hilligoss will remind many viewers of David Lynch's "Eraserhead".Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate cult horror masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film! It's one of my all time favourite movies and I'd rate it as a deservedly acclaimed cult classic and the eeriest, most strangely compelling, most unforgettable and greatest horror movie of all time.The camera work is beautiful. The organ music, creepy carnival and director Herk Harvey as the figure of Death are all unforgettably eerie. The first time I saw this film (I had already read about it's making in an issue of Fangoria) was on BBC2's Moviedrome introduced by Alex Cox (himself the director of Repo Man, the lacklustre and innacurate Sid &amp; Nancy and the amazing Well Did You Evah music video. On watching the film I was captivated and fascinated and ultimately at the film's conclusion had a strange feeling of deja vu, as if I'd seen it before in a dream or something, long ago.There are a number of surreal and creepy scenes in the film. The scene where Mary (Candace Hilligoss) goes to the abandoned carnival during the day has a surreal, dreamlike and sensual beauty. Whereas the later scenesof Mary playing the church organ and seeing in her mind, the dead rising from the sea and the film's carnival/beach conclusion are at once dreamlike and yet somehow documentarylike at the same time. It's unforgettable imagery like this that makes this film such an unforgettable experience. On the other hand, the drunk lodger's attempts to seduce Mary are amusing and some of her biting dialogue and sarcasm helps keep the non horror moments entertaining. The film is also notable for having a clear influence onfilms and filmmakers like George A Romero's classic "Night Of The Living Dead" (another 60s b/w horror classic) and David Lynch (compare Herk Harvey's ghoul with Killer Bob's surreal and frightening appearances at unexpected times in Twin Peaks). Be warned however, once you experience the dreamlike qualities of this eerie masterpiece, I can'tguarantee you'll ever awake from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sound was horrible in this film. The acting seemed like it was done by high school students. The score was unneeded. The direction was horrible. Nothing was explained. I loved this film. I know, many of you are probably wondering why I loved a film that denounces everything I feel is needed in a film, but for some odd reason in this film it worked. This was a very scary movie. Not the kind of scary that you need blood or violence to make you jump, but the kind that the violins seemed to shrill your way to behind a pillow. I was really impressed that this film was released in 1962. I would put money down that if this film were to be released today it would do really well. As I watched this film, I made the comment that this could very well have been a Mystery Science Theater 3000 film. There were certain elements to it that I could see Joel or the bots just making fun of. So, in that sense, I am glad that I didn't see the film with those guys commenting through it, I may not have enjoyed it as much. This was a film full of symbolism, of imagination, and of surprises. I loved the way that Mary went from real life to when people couldn't hear or see her. It showed that something supernatural was at work instead of just some crazy guy following her around. The carnival was spooky. This is one of those films that you would put on at Halloween with a great bottle of wine and your best girl by your side. Without giving too much away, I enjoyed how this film came to it's conclusion. As the visions of the phantom man became greater and greater, it was obvious that the cops were getting closer and closer to finding the car. I also enjoyed the fact that the "undead" of the film all came out of water to be reborn. It was great foreshadowing to what would happen to Mary. The director took many risks with the symbolism that he used, and it worked better than some films with today's CGI abilities. You could tell as you watched this film that imagination was flowing with the writer of this film.It proved that even without a budget you could make a film that would last the test of time, and even be remade over and over again. The surprises were easy, but fun. I saw the ending of this film coming a mile away, but it still kept my attention. Overall, this film is like a great wine. Imagine opening a bottle of merlot from 1962 and having the whole afternoon to enjoy it. That is how I feel about this film. A definite for anyone to have in their collection!!Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating, Influential Only Feature By Herk Harvey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Herk Harvey toiled away for over a decade in educational and industrial films before taking a chance on filming a feature length movie in the Fall of 1961. He gathered backers from Lawrence, Kansas, used a graduate film student (Sandy Berger) to cast the lead (Candace Hilligoss), and filmed the movie during a three week vacation period. The center set piece was the abandoned Saltair amusement park in Utah, which has its own mysterious history. The story goes that Harvey was traveling home to Lawrence, Kansas on business and came upon the Saltair amusement park from afar, stopped, became fascinated by it, and then returned with the idea of making a horror movie featuring it.He approached his colleague John Clifford to write the script and Carnival Of Souls was born. Often cited as an influence on Directors George A. Romero and David Lynch, Carnival Of Souls is an eerie film about what happens when a young girl emerges from what looks to be certain death. Herk Harvey creates a spooky little chiller that draws us in right from the beginning. The black and white cinematography is Bergmanesque in construction with inventive camera angles and an ethereal feel. The scenes that come to mind are the ones in the organ factory and the amusement park pavilion. Gene Moore's music on the organ may be one of the most unique soundtracks ever created, especially for a horror film; it adds immeasurably to the moody atmosphere. The make-up effects are also very effective,considering the film is in black and white. The film relies on its Twilight Zone-like ability to make everyday people, places, and activities seem suspect. The acting by Candace Hilligoss is very good for such a low budget production, and reportedly she didn't know what her character's motivation was throughout the filming; Harvey's intent was to maintain a look of confusion on Hilligoss' face. This is very evident in retrospect, and is the main reason why the audience identifies with her so easily. For a film that had to be edited so quickly, with an entire reel of film being lost by the developer, there are very few technical errors. Although the film is somewhat predictable eventually, it still remains a fascinating, influential, original work of horror outside the Hollywood mainstream. Unfortunately, this was the only feature film Herk Harvey made due to the fact that he was never paid by the distributors, who went out of business. Today it has become a cult staple among horror film buffs; that's quite an achievement for an industrial filmmaker from Lawrence, Kansas. *** of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As close to pure cinema as America ever came.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The is finest film ever made in America, barr none. That it was directed by a professional documentarian on what appears to be a budget of a hundred bucks, with a cast of total unknowns, only makes it all the more remarkable. First, let's get the 'low-budget' issue out of the way, because during the later '80s this film developed a following among those who especially admire cheap films. Applying that to this film is a big mistake. This film isn't about money, it's about cinema - what you can and cannot do with a camera and an editing board, using whatever it is one has to work with.As with all pure cinema - from Citizen Kane to the Wild Bunch, from the Battleship Potemkin to the Seven Samurai - this film works on many levels at the same time. It is, first, an effective ghost story, in fact probably the only instance of a film that has a real ghost story to tell (most ghost-story films are really horror movies or romances). Then it is also an uncompromising psychological analysis of female frigidity. It is also surrealistic psycho-drama, but it is also a genuine slice of Americana - the film certainly has resonance with the films of Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, but it is determined to present its American characters in their American locations as American, and not as europhilic wannabes. Consequently it is also an historical document of what America was like in the early '60s - really a kind of weird place by today's standards.One of the qualities that makes a film 'pure cinema' is that the viewer should, on reflection, feel utterly convinced that there is not a camera shot out of place, not a wasted moment, not an image or sound we don't need to have the complete film before us. But of course while watching the film, we should be so captivated by it, we set our critical mind to rest. Despite the darkness of its themes and images, this film drags us along like some obsessive-compulsion we didn't even know we had.Finally, when watching a truly great film, when the final credit rolls, we should feel as if we have actually experienced the film, not simply watched it. This quality does diminish after repeated viewing - when you find yourself reciting the dialog by heart, you know that you've passed onto the level of remembering the film's experience, rather than living it. But certainly, after the initial viewing we should feel as though we have been changed by the film, and that we now look at the world through different eyes.This film is really about the fundamental puritanism that remains the core of the American world-view. It treats that world-view with both outrage, sympathy, and even, if one pays close attention, a touch of humor. The souls in this movie are lost souls - but its their carnival, after all; and we're welcomed to it any time we care to visit. However, be forewarned: once inside, we may have to stay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Title: Carnival of Souls (1962) Director: Herk Harvey Cast: Candace Hilligoss, Frances Feist, Sidney Berger, Art Ellison, Stan Levitt, Tom McGinnis Review: I love going back in time while watching old horror films. I love to see what scared people in different eras and times. Some people completely dismiss old films just because they are old. I relish the moment when I can find an obscure gem and just indulge in it. Sometimes I find a true classic like when I saw White Zombie for the first time...sometimes I find a dud like when I saw the original 13 Ghosts. This time around in my humble opinion I have found a really creepy and surreal film in director Herk Harveys Carnival of Souls.The story is about this girl called Mary who gets involved in a car accident in which she emerges completely unharmed. All her friends die, but she is left in a perfect state. She decides to move to a new town to start anew. She takes a job in a church as a "profesional organist" and moves into a new place. Unfortunately she begins seeing a ghostly apparition and she is strangely attracted by the spooky abandoned amusement park near her new home. What horrors await for her inside? And why is she seeing these visions? This film has a few faults in various departments. For one, I thought that the editing in the movie really sucked. You'll notice little skips here and there in the continuity of the film, it doesn't flow fluidly. It hits a few speed bumps along the way. The sound was also a bit atrocious at times, I could barely make out what they were saying in certain parts at the beginning of the film. But somehow...in spite of all of its flaws this movie had me reeled in from the get go.The character of Mary is likable so I felt like sticking with her and seeing where she was going to end up. I liked her attitude about her job in church just "being a job". She didn't take religion seriously and I was like "whoa, there's a girl with a head on her shoulders!". Anyhows, I kept watching and things began to get a whole lot more interesting as the film progressed. Its one of those films that has a bad start (mainly because of its technical faults) but as it goes on it gets really good.I loved the strange location they used to shoot the old abandoned amusement park. Apparently there really was an abandoned amusement park in the middle of nowhere and they shot part of the movie there! The director was wise to take advantage of this location and shoot the hell out of it. It has a real isolated feel to it. You can tell, it really is in the middle of nowheresville. So that added to the feeling of creepyness and isolation. Specially seeing Mary going into it all by herself.Once the spooks join in on the story, well things get really nightmarish. And heres where the film won its classic status for me. The images that the film conjures up, specially towards the last half of the film are some of the most surreal, nightmarish I have seen on screen. And to top things off, its all in black and white which adds another layer of spookiness to the whole affair.As I watched it I thought to myself, man, this director was really ahead of his time! And he was! He managed to make some truly haunting imagery all the way back in 1962! Sadly because the critics shot this movie down, he never made more feature films. He did manage to make a lot of educational documentaries. But no more movies.So if you are up from some truly spooky surreal images that feel like something that came out of your worst nightmares, go rent this baby. Just remember it has a few imperfections here and there, but once you get through the rough stuff, you'll get to what really matters. Those spooky ass visions filled with ghosts and ghouls! Sweet Dreams! Rating: 3 1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I am a self-avowed fan of low-budget horror flicks, "cult" classics, etc.., I was expecting to be disappointed by Carnival of Souls. The little I allowed myself to read about COS before watching it made me feel like it was either going to be disappointing and slow or right on target (weighted average is around 7). Instead, it was almost certainly the creepiest, eeriest movie I have ever seen. At the age of 21, most might expect me to have had my senses dulled by MTV-style shock theatre, but whatever damage has been done was not enough to diminish in any way the effect of this brilliant movie. I, in fact, read the screenplay to "The Hitch-hiker" (the Twilight zone script many have referenced as an inspiration for this movie) for an 8th grade class, but even that knowledge did not diminish my admiration for this low-budget masterpiece. The photography is incredible and atmospheric, with many of the lighting contrasts and unexpected appearances of "the ghoul" extremely effective. The acting was actually rather good, with Candace Hilligoss believable as the cold, yet seemingly psychotic lead character. I found the slimy man-next-door to be played even more convincingly, with all the repulsiveness of a real-life slum Casanova. The Saltair setting was also brilliant. Honestly, I have to stop exuding praise, but this movie really knocked me off my feet, with only occasional moments of slow-but-tensionless action early in the movie keeping this from being a ten. All in all, the best low-budget indie horror movie I've ever seen (and that includes Night of the Living Dead).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mary and her two friends leave the road and fly off a bridge during a friendly dragster race. She is the only survivor and after her recovery she takes up a job as the church organist in a new town, but she is constantly blighted by a ghostly like visitor and periods of time when nobody seems to know she exists.A hinted spoiler follows.Carnival Of Souls has thankfully found a whole new audience in the new millennium, the advent of cheap triple pack DVDs and a lush Criterion release have brought it firmly to the attention of Horror/Ghost fans who were not aware that the film even existed. That said, there is no doubting that many big name directors were fully aware of it, tho, for Carnival Of Souls has influenced such luminary genre masters from Romero to Carpenter, and from Hooper to Shyamalan, be it the low budget DIY ethic, or its now genre staple twist ending, it's a film (along with it's director Herk Harvey) that is referenced as much as it is copied.The tag often used for the film is that it's an elongated Twilight Zone episode, and sure enough I think that is a perfect fit. Its whole structure feels like a part of that wonderful and amazing Rod Serling show, and for sure this story owes a doff of the cap to An Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge (an Ambrose Bierce short that was reworked and used on Serling's show), but to merely suggest a retread of a previously used idea would be very unfair. Carnival Of Souls is full of eerie sequences that are dream like in quality yet goose pimply in effect. Scored at frequent intervals by a jangling organ shrill, the ghostly phantoms that plague poor Mary actually bring a shiver to the spine; while a surrealistic dance of the carnival is a stunning eerie highlight. It's a wonderfully brought together story that has one pondering uneasily from the get go, managing to jolt your senses adroitly with a very special ending.With a small budget of only $30,000 and a cast of friends, Herk Harvey crafted one of the best independent horror sub-genre films ever made. Don't believe me? Then go ask Romero, Raimi or Hooper. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How scary a movie can be? Carnival of souls is scary as no other movie is by one simply reason, this film won't only frighten you to death but also will lead you to a desolation state: You won't shout, you won't scream because you'll feel too desolated and scared to do it. The plot happens to be superb: I love it when the whole plot starts making sense by the very end.Candace Hilligoss play Mary Henry the lead role; the character is great and her performance is magnificent, she just gives the movie a vulnerable element that sometimes turns to be dark and mysterious.Carnival of Souls became a cult film with plenty of honors; it's not only one of the most scary movies ever but also is a masterpiece of moviemaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the epitome of "B' movie horror. Herk Harvey shows how small budget and holding the audience on edge by not showing everything that they are afraid of. By letting us use our imagination, our own fears take over and give the fright we are looking for. Very close to nightmare we have all had. I think this movie can show what simple techniques can do to scare the hell out of us. IE the scene while Candace Hilligoss was driving and a reflection appeared in the side car window. You must look past some over acting but Herk uses many real towns people in the movie.Put this up with 'Night of the living dead" Original.

		<fullReview>After a traumatic accident, a woman (Candace Hilligoss) becomes drawn to a mysterious abandoned carnival.This film is a horror movie more in the psychological sense. It relies on surreal camera-work, eerie organ music, and minimal actual frights (though some zombie-like beings do show up). This film reminded me of Hitchcock's "Vertigo" in its pacing and mood, though the plots have absolutely nothing to do with each other (this film was once an Ambrose Bierce short story). The black and white was not a hindrance and at times added something more. The sound could have been better. A colorized, touched-up version exists, but I did not see that one (I would get it for the Mike Nelson commentary track, but otherwise avoid it). I appreciate how it was independent film-making at its finest. Department store scenes shot on the fly, a cast of college kids... as far as classics go, this one has the most independent pedigree -- no one associated with this film had a history or went on to become anyone big, but all were / are known for this film.If you do not like a slow film and do not like black and white films, stay away. But if this is your cup of tea and you want to see a piece of horror history (this film inspired David Lynch, Tim Burton and other directors) you must see this film at some point. Super-recommended for the true horror fan.If you are looking to own it, you must get the Criterion Collection version. Various versions exist (I presume because it is in the public domain), but Criterion has the best looking one, and they have loaded their two discs with special features (featurettes, audio commentary and more).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carnival of Souls was made on a rather low budget, but despite this I found it very creepy.A car crashes off a bridge into a river, killing everybody, so it seems. A little while later, one of its passengers, a woman, emerges from the river uninjured. She accepts a job offer of a church organist in another town and she makes that her new home. She then keeps seeing a strange phantom like ghoul everywhere she goes and nobody else can see it. This strange creature seems to come from a derelict pavilion and towards the end, a load more of ghouls appear and attack her and looks like she dies.The movie is quite weird at times, but very creepy. The organ music score is creepy as well.The cast is made up of unknowns, lead by Candace Hillgoss.Carnival of Souls is a must for horror fans and don't watch this alone.Rating: 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very scary film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having a rather lively imagination as a child, I was very careful of films that I watched. I had heard about Polanski's Repulsion, but I decided not to see it as I knew it would give me nightmares, even though I was very curious about it and would be interested to watch it now. However, today I find most horror films amusing. This one I found very scary, and very effective indeed. Even now, after becoming inured to such things, I watched it very cautiously.What makes it so frightening?The derelict and everydayness of the locations. The filming in black and white adds to the darkness portrayed. The interminable tacky organ music which varied between saccharine low grade church music and a fairground steam organ, becoming more discordant as the tension builds. The dissociation of the subject. It is if the viewer participates in Mary's despair and what may be her drift into insanity. It is a film about survivors guilt.It is like watching a nightmare, rather than a straight horror film. It is the cinematography that gives this film the edge, the darkness, the timing and intervals where nothing much seems to happen.I congratulate the makers of this strange film for its subtlety and effectiveness. Don't watch this film with the lights out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before the days of Herschell Gordon Lewis, when heavy gore in the average horror movie started to become a staple, filmmakers had to scare audiences in other ways. Through mood, lighting, and plot movement, CARNIVAL OF SOULS manages to accomplish just as much horror as any modern flick.This is the story of Mary Henry (Candice Hilligoss), a church organist who, one fateful day, finds herself in the passenger side of a car engaged in a drag race. Granted, the cars are obviously moving very slowly, but they do race across a bridge. Suddenly, Mary and her friends plummet off of the bridge (it doesn't clearly show why this happens) and the credits roll. Later, Mary is seen rising up from the waters below, cold and wet but otherwise unharmed.This is only the beginning for poor Mary, as she starts having flashes in which everything around her goes silent and people completely ignore her, as though she didn't exist. She also begins seeing a pale, ghastly man everywhere she goes. The man torments her relentlessly, later joined by an ensemble of zombie-like people who pursue her.In spite of the somewhat campy dialogue and effects, CARNIVAL OF SOULS does stand up to the test of time and is very much worth watching for fans of older horror movies. It is currently public domain, so anyone wishing to see it might be able to find it for free online.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An evocative, eerie masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now THIS is a great film. It was made cheaply, that's for sure, and there is some camp value in it, but it's unbelievable what Herk Harvey accomplishes artistically. This film emits a mood almost entirely unique, barely describable. There's a constant feeling of surreal dread, almost overbearing in some scenes. I was completely absorbed by the film. It even caused me to jump, without the slightest sting (i.e., a quick, piercing musical cue), when I should have entirely expected what was coming. I wasn't thinking ahead at all in the film, but was just feeling it. That is enormous praise. I have to commend specifically the cinematography and the music. The shot composition is absolutely beautiful. It succeeds in not being particularly showy. And it's not that I mind showiness. I can find that fun, too. But it is amazing that a film like this could be so carefully photographed that I had to fight my mind to notice the excellence of it. That is, the cinematography worked 100% to enhance the mood. The score is made up mostly of organ music (the main character plays the organ at a local church. so there's good use of both diagetic and extra-diagetic music; in general, the use of sound in the film is excellent), and, well, the pipe organ is an enormously creepy instrument in the first place - church scares the hell out of me! - but this music is particularly chilling. The editing is also very good. I especially like the use of speeding up the film near its end. I guess the only weak spot would be the story. You can see the ending coming from a long ways away. But I say that this film is absolutely NOT about its plot. It's all about mood, which is the single most important aspect of any work of art. And if you like Carnival of Souls, may I suggest Night of the Hunter (Charles Laughton, 1955). You most likely know of that film if you've seen Carnival of Souls, but if you haven't, I suggest it very much. This movie seemed to me to be partly inspired by that one. Also Incubus (Leslie Stevens, 1965), which is the film starring William Shatner speaking Esperanto. It is a bit campier than Carnival of Souls, but it still manages to be entirely creepy, not to mention amazingly photographed.PS: I saw the extended director's cut on Criterion DVD (the set has both versions, and I certainly plan to watch the original one ASAP). The DVD set is beautifully restored - the picture is just exquisite - and the discs have a lot of extras. It also has some other great perks: the cover art is gorgeous and so are the DVD menus, which play different selections of the organ music on different screens.</fullReview>

When it seems that the girls have drowned and there are no survivors, Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) surprisingly leaves the water. A couple of days later, she drives to another town to work as organist in a church despite not being religious. While driving, she has visions of a weird man. When she arrives at her destiny, she moves to a room in the boarding house owned by Mrs. Thomas (Frances Feist). However Mary is haunted by spirits and is frequently drawn to a nearby abandoned carnival, where she discloses a dark secret."Carnival of Souls" is a sort of episode of "Twilight Zone", with an intriguing tale of a woman that survives to a tragic accident and is haunted by souls, trapped between the world of the living and the dead. The use of shadows and the make-up are really scary and the creepy story works well but could be a little shorter; furthermore the conclusion is predictable. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not AvailableNote: on 27 March 2015, I saw this movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't belong in the world?Carnival of Souls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This little gem from 1962 has been on my to see list for years. I've eyed the Criterion Collection version, almost buying it a couple of times, until finally looking away until I knew for sure it was worth purchasing. I can safely say that Carnival of Souls is well deserving of the Criterion treatment and soon a place in my film catalog. Director Herk Harvey has put together a real work of art and amazingly it was to be his only non-documentary/educational film ever finished. Taking a break from his real directing job, he took two weeks and shot this lone fictional narrative. Harvey definitely had an eye for cinema and it's a shame no one could persuade him to do more.Telling the story of a young girl, played nicely by Candace Hilligoss, who crashed into a river with two friends and emerged as the lone survivor. She miraculously leaves the accident scene and continues on with her life, traveling to a church where she will be the new organ player. Along the way she has her first vision of a creepy figure peering at her through her car window. The camera-work is handled expertly as the reflection of her face changes to that of the man. Upon the conclusion of her drive, we are also treated with a nice transition from panning to a black sky that soon opens up to light as we've cut to a room's door. Unfortunately this is the one and only inventive cut, but it begs to wonder whether Marc Forster had seen it before doing transition after transition like it in his masterpiece of emotions, tone, and visuals Stay. The real question, as far as gleaning goes, is whether David Lynch had seen the film in his lifetime. I have to believe he must have and for that I am eternally grateful to Harvey, because without Carnival of Souls, I may never have been able to see two of my favorite movies in Lost Highway and Mulholland Dr. There is so much that parallels between these three films that it's hard to believe there is not a connection. Our creepy man from another plane, expertly played by director Harvey himself, is almost carbon-copied into the Mystery Man from Lost Highway. Also, the main drive of a character on the run from reality and suffering, deciding to instead live inside their own head until they can finally cope with what has transpired is paramount to these Lynch films as well as Stay. Bill Pullman, Naomi Watts, and Ryan Gosling all have to deal with their internal demons and a feeling of no longer belonging in the living, rational world, just as Hilligoss needs to as she runs from the souls in her visions.Just seeing the haunting vision of zombified apparitions dancing at the deserted carnival amongst hanging streamers reflecting light is worth the viewing time of Carnival of Souls. Anyone who treats this film as fodder for Mystery Science Theatre 3000, which rumor has it that a new DVD edition will have a commentary laugh track by its' star, is sorely mistaken. This is a work of art that has spawned many of our contemporary classics, at least in my mind. Showing the fourth dimension crossing through a person's consciousness is stunning to behold and think that it was done forty years ago. Even auteurs like Lynch need inspiration, and I have to say he either picked a good one to borrow from or great minds really do think alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never heard of this movie and came upon it only while flipping channels. This is a great movie but it's one of those movies that grows on you. At first I thought it was dumb and I just didn't get it. It's very eerie and has somewhat a dreamlike quality to it. This was in the '60s so the movie depended on fright-makeup and really ugly people for special effects.I appreciated the movie beyond its celluloid being. The filmmakers threw in every idea they had in their heads into the movie. No line was drawn. Nothing was unassailable. It didn't have to make sense as long as an idea was weird and creeped out someone on the set. To some people this might seem senseless but for some strange reason I got it. The innocent quality of the movie is a breath of fresh air. No hidden messages. No untruths to be uncovered from the facts.While watching the movie I thought about directors whose work I love. Films whereby passion outweighed everything else. Did Ed Wood had some influence on Herk Harvey? Was David Lynch inspired by Carnival of Souls?Watch it without prejudice and you'll see the simplicity and brilliance the filmmakers were trying to acheive. Watch it with a jaded, pretentious eye and you could be missing out on a movie that was more thought provoking than it intended to be.</fullReview>

She moves into a place that's not quite a hostel and not quite a B&amp;B.She gets a job as a church organist. She also becomes the attraction of a man called John Linden. But, she finds herself drawn to an abandoned carnival and is also haunted by a phantom. (played by Herk Harvey, the man who directed this film). She also begins to experience weird goings on.

		<fullReview>I remember it like it was three years ago....given the opportunity to show a film at Chico State for a class on American genres, I showed Carnival of Souls. Admittedly, I would have rather shown Eraserhead, Targets or The Cat People if they were available on DVD. I knew it wasn't a choice to please a bunch of trendy, cell phone toting coeds and after showing it only one person in the classroom said they enjoyed it. In my following discussion I explained why I chose this film over the more popular choices and it went something like this.Horror films should resemble their antagonist, their origin should be mysterious and unexpected. They should be original enough to feel like an entity unto itself, not a knockoff of another. They should be flawed in a way that alienates those who arn't submitting themselves to it (anyone raised on the latest cookie cutter party-of-five slashers.) If it is considered flawless, a horror film becomes too slick, too well acted and too careful to give enough doses of what is expected, thus feels like a Hollywood creation, not something of great excess that welled up in the middle of nowhere like a Lovecraftian monster, crawled onto the screen and then left just as fast (I also recommend Dementia, Paperhouse, I bury the Living, The Sadist and anything Bava.) I do not regret showing Carnival of Souls. Someday maybe it will stand out in some classmates mind, and if not it may be because of circumstances. This film needs to be seen with the lights low, late at night and without expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The script is a padded ripoff of a "Twilight Zone" episode, but this chiller still has its own peculiar power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Ebert says this movie plays like a lost episode of "The Twilight Zone." Actually, it plays like a very specific episode: "The Hitch-Hiker," scripted by Rod Serling from a radio play by Lucille Fletcher. John Clifford, who is credited with writing the script, evidently took this half-hour story and padded it to feature length.The heroine in both films is a woman who survives a car crash only to be harassed by a mysterious figure. Clifford adds zombies and an abandoned pavilion and a scene where our heroine walks around a department store unable to hear or make contact with anyone. He introduces the theme of religion. The woman is now a church organist who is indifferent to people and considers her job in a church to be just that: a job.The theme goes nowhere and so does the story. Clifford comes to his twist ending in a such a roundabout way that it induces groans rather than gasps of shock. "The Twilight Zone" episode, by contrast, makes its way crisply to the point.Yet none of this really matters. The sloppily-constructed script prevents this low-budget feature from being a genuine classic, but doesn't stop it from getting under your skin.What is it about this movie? Well, for starters there's Candace Hilligoss, an ethereal blonde who seems cold even when she's smiling. Herk Harvey, who directed and produced, was extremely lucky to find this woman. What are the chances Harvey ? a director of educational movies in Kansas making his first (and as it turns out, only) feature film ? would ever find a beautiful young woman who really could act and convincingly project an air of apartness from the human race? Hilligoss, though she never made another significant movie, could have improved any number of higher-profile Hollywood B-flicks, which often featured wooden leading ladies.There's the organ music from Gene Moore, which unsettlingly moves from reverent to "profane," as one character complains. And there's the work of Harvey and his photographer, Maurice Prather, who give us several strikingly well-composed images. The overhead shot of Hilligoss emerging from the water onto muddy land chills me every time.The supporting cast is mainly just what you'd expect from a stable of educational film veterans: laughably poor. But there are two exceptions. Frances Feist plays Hilligoss' amusingly eccentric landlady with a certain creepy edge. (Yes, she ruins the scene where Hilligoss tells her there's a strange man in the house. This is probably due less to her lack of acting skill than to the high cost of retakes.) Sidney Berger plays Feist's only other boarder. I can't improve on Ebert's remark that he is "a definitive study of a nerd in lust." Berger is funny and even a bit poignant, though he overplays some of his scenes.But all this accounting of virtues and flaws doesn't capture the essence of this strange movie. You just have to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Low Budget Horror Film - Eerie And Hypnotic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the remake of "Carnival of Souls" a few years back, and my God - it was one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. Simply put, it was a complete mess and I was utterly disappointed with it. I'd heard the original was brilliant, but I didn't get around to seeing this until just recently - and wow - I was very impressed. The film begins very quickly, the first rough shot is just three normal girls in a car, among them is Mary (Candace Hilligoss). They are challenged to a drag race by some guys, and ultimately end up crashing off the side of a bridge, plummeting into a river. The police assume all the girls died in the accident, but we then see Mary creeping out of the water onto shore. After the traumatic accident, Mary relocates to a boarding house and gets a job playing the organ at a local church, trying to put the accident behind her. But her life begins to spiral out of control - she is strangely attracted to some old property that was formerly converted into a carnival, which is now abandoned and dilapidated. She keeps on seeing a strange ghoul-like man who seems to be following her everywhere she goes, and she begins having very strange encounters. What is happening to Mary? Is she losing her mind? I have to admit, this movie really wouldn't seem great at a glance. The acting is often wooden and bland, the story is bizarre, the music is overdone, the editing was pretty bad, and the direction was amateurish. Sound like a bad movie? Well, "Carnival of Souls" isn't even close to being a bad film. There's something about this movie that invokes a sense of unease and dread all throughout it's brisk running time. It's hard to describe, but the entire film has such a strong surreal atmosphere - like there's a thread running under everything that occurs, but you can't really put your finger on it. It may seem like a corny film by today's standards, and it won't do well with most modern audiences, but it is a very well-crafted and very nicely written film.The entire film was done on a very modest budget, and this movie proves what great results can come from a low-budgeted production. It's a classic black and white B-movie, but it has a certain charm that's attained through the psychologically-tormented heroine (who is also somewhat a damsel in distress), and the inventive camera-work and chilling little moments. Obviously an American-Gothic film, the main focus is on Mary, and she is put through psychological hell throughout the course of the film, and Candace Hilligoss plays her quite well. Is she really losing it? Who is the man that's following her? This eerie quality is what made the film so great for me. It makes you feel uncomfortable, like everything is out of place, and something is seriously wrong. I can understand why it has such a heavy cult following, and deservedly so. The carnival sequences are really spooky, and are played along with the eerie organ music, giving it a sinister quality. All of the questions that this film creates are tied up rather loosely at the end of the film, which is a smart and appropriate conclusion. To me and many others (from what I've read), it is fairly obvious that George Romero took some inspiration from this film for his equally enjoyable classic "Night of the Living Dead". I can understand why some people find this film laughable, because by today's standards this film can easily be dismissed as outdated and campy. But horror fans who respect these early films really need to check this movie out, because it is really a wonderfully spooky and influential piece of cinema.Overall, "Carnival of Souls" is an important staple in the horror genre, even if it was never intended to be. It is little-known of and most people who watch it probably think it's outdated, but if you respect the horror genre, this early (and important) installment is a must see, It's surreal, dreamlike, atmospheric, and eerie. While Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" is hailed as the ultimate low-budget horror classic, this film did come first and it might just be a notch above the beloved zombie classic. All things considered, "Carnival of Souls" is a misunderstood and underrated film. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really got a kick out of this movie. It is all atmosphere and strange organ music. People just speaking lines of everyday dialogue become as frightening as the dead man whose face appears time and time again. The central figure, Mary Henry, was apparently as spooky before she went in the water as she was after she walked onto the muddy riverbank. Her relationships with a series of townsfolk are as dull as can be (I love her landlady who tells her she can have as many baths as she wants)--and yet the sterility other encounters really adds to the suspense. The scene after she is fired for playing Satanic organ music, as she goes on a date with her sleazy fellow boarder who is hustling her from the get go, is a classic. She is so boring and yet he keeps on coming. She is attractive at times and a nut case at other. She makes no connections with human beings, but that's probably the point. I enjoyed the place where the doctor kept his back to Mary so he could turn the chair around and transform into that same dead guy and frighten us. Whoa, I never expected that. It was really fun in a Pinteresque kind of way. On an obvious shoestring budget, shooting in Kansas, Herk Harvey (what a great name; director of the Academy Award winning "Fire Safety Is Your Problem"), plays with light, shadows bad makeup, overly quick cuts, but it does work. It's a scary movie and I would recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I remember those days....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the early sixties it was a lot harder to make a movie on a shoestring budget than it is now. Little things like synchronized sound could be very daunting. This movie certainly shares the distinctly impoverished atmosphere of its kind, which sometimes works to its advantage and sometimes against it. The sound editing in particular hurts. The scene with the car radio doesn't work as well as it should because the music that's supposed to be coming over the radio is almost indistinguishable from the actual music score, dulling the impact. And one of the film's most notably eerie scenes (possible spoiler) when the heroine suddenly finds herself cut off from those around her, unable to hear them as they are unable to hear her, is undercut by the fact that many earlier sequences are also without sound due to the presumably limited resources of the sound editor, so the sense of something wrong isn't as strong as it should be. Other technical crudities tend to distance the viewer from the main character and her plight. That said, the movie has much going for it. It's intelligent and shows a strong imagination and flair for the bizarre. The acting is variable but frequently very good. And one or two sequences are as creepy as anything ever put on film, more remarkably so because it's hard to put your finger on WHY they're so unsettling. The ending is predictable, although perhaps it wasn't as much so when the film was first released. All in all a must see for true horror fans (although slasher geeks will doubtless be bored stiff).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting is bad, the cinematography is atrocious, bad background music, but one of the scariest films ever made. Incredibly, all its faults contribute to the brilliance of the film. In the same class as Night of the Living dead. A young lady believes she just survived a car accident not realizing she's actually dead. At times, nothing abnormal is happening but on occasion, she stops hearing sounds like birds chirping or people talking, nor does it seem that anybody sees or hears her. As fast as these moments happen they go away. The most chilling part though is the sudden appearances of a white faced ghoul (he actually directed the movie). Your on the edge of your seat every time she looks in a mirror. Watch this movie late at night. Pleasant dreams.</fullReview>

I also caught the Twilight Zone analogy right away, but I wish most posts would go back further to note the story was lifted from "An Incident at Owl Creek Bridge" by Ambrose Bierce. The car even goes off a bridge and when the main character character does not come out of the water until some time later, well that was a dead give away (pun intended) as to the plot's anticipated conclusion for me. While I did not review all comments, most failed to probe further than the Twilight Zone origins or stylistic appearance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I used to watch the butchered version of this in my NYC youth on whatever local station was showing horror flicks late night Saturdays (usually several if I was lucky). It was one of only a handful of titles that really scared the crap out of me. Released in 1961, this is cheap, cheap, cheap (the budget was literally $13,000, no joke). But that's part of its charm. Director Herk Harvey (who also plays the ghoul in the film) took every opportunity to shoot anything and everything on the considerable horizon, that he knew wouldn't still be there in two years, like the amusement park on the Salt Lake. That body of water was known for moving from year to year and when this was shot had just about drowned out the old fun-land on it's banks. Harvey just took a camera and moved right in, those police barricades you see, to keep people out were real! No sets were built. The place looks dead and creepy because, it IS dead and creepy. This is the main, but hardly only, charm of this deserved cult favorite. That it also has a literate script, which obviously knows how dumb the setups are, and how scary things should get, is the rest of it. The actors, too, especially Frances Feist as a fidgety, clueless landlady and the wonderful Sidney Berger as a sleaze-bag neighbor, are surprisingly effective. Candace Hilligoss however (they needed a "star" and she came closest to what the budget constraints would allow), is your basic stick of wood; but the character requires stoicism, just not so much, that you could make an end table out her. Forget about that, though. There's so much magic and old-fashioned bizarre b&amp;w "Twilight Zone" atmosphere that if you unclench your muscles and plan on enjoying this, you can't be disappointed. "Carnival Of Souls" makes the best of one bad situation after another. Harvey needed a memorable score, so he made the ingnue a church organist; that allowed him to drench the scenario in what is clearly the best Gothic organ score ever written for a film. Rather than build sets, he found them, and they are incredible. This was Herk Harvey's brilliance. Any other director would have turned this project into a bin full of mandolin picks. I interviewed the director by telephone in 1995. A friendly, unassuming man, he explained that this was his only theatrical film. He had been teaching film classes at a college in Lawrence, Kansas for years. He did many films, but they were all industrial flicks, made to promote a business, service or government function. Even at that, they had large budgets and often featured big Hollywood stars. He was a contemporary of such famous directors as Robert Altman (who also got his start making industrial shorts). So that's how you go about watching this. You drink in the ingenuity of a guy who put his all into a one shot project that failed at the box office. Sure, it's not great, but it has greatness in it, and yeah, it is absolutely unique. You wanna see how bad this movie might have been? Check out respectable horror director Wes Craven's much larger budget color remake from just a few years ago. It's a total turkey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still my favorite film of all time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The imagination and heart that went into the making of "Carnival of Souls" is unreal; you just didn't see this level of quality in '60s drive-in flicks very often. Seemingly based on an episode of "The Twilight Zone" called 'The Hitchhiker' (as one previous reviewer has mentioned), "Carnival" is not packed with action, blood and guts, or sex. It is a quiet, thoroughly disturbing film that must have baffled audiences in 1962. Everyone else has already described the plot, so I'll just focus on what made the movie so great: 1.) Gene Moore's moody, atmospheric organ score. I can't imagine "Carnival" with a different soundtrack. 2.) The superb camera-work of Maurice Prather (watch the original "Night of the Living Dead" to see his influence!). 3.) Saltair, the old carnival itself. There's never been a creepier location in the history of film. 4.) Director Herk Harvey as the wild-eyed, leering "ghost" who torments Candace Hilligoss. 5.) The slow, creeping certainty that something is wrong...and cannot be righted. This is simply a beautiful piece of cinematic art, made all the more precious by the fact that it was Harvey's only feature film. See it; you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just had the opportunity to watch the AMC release of this movie on DVD. It can be tough to follow at times, as it is very choppy and has some odd transition, surely due to film damage. The movie is a bit convoluted, jumping right into the action with two girls racing two guys in a drag race, then flying off a bridge into a river. One of the girls seems to escape from the car. Did she? It's hard to say. In one scene she is walking from the wreck, and in the next she is playing a church organ. Her nights are haunted by visions, and her days are spent trying to figure it all out. She seems to suffer from episodes that are disconcerting and surreal, which makes you wonder what her true state of being is. There is some phenominal imagery used at the end, along with many creative camera shots.I am impressed with the ideas behind this movie, given the budget that was used and the time it was made. I may have to watch it again to see if I can pick up a couple of nuances I missed the first time around. It is a great addition to any classic movie collection. Like many modern suspense movies, not everything you see is as it seems. That works very well for this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good low budget horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Granted this movie has some budgetary limitations, that it, for the most part, transcends. The use of silence and sound in this movie is fascinating and surreal. The plot while overly predictable to modern viewers, set the stage for many subsequent horror films. Unlike many films of interest to film history buffs this movie is still suspenseful. The cinematography is quirky and riddled with close-ups and other shots that seem heavily influenced by the German expressionist silent film canon and is heavily visual, which is really unusual since it seems to fit this story, which uses many of the conventions of 50s horror. It is also unusual since most low-budget horror/sci-fi films of this era tend to try to relay much of the action through dialogue, because it's cheaper. This movie does have some shortcomings, namely some of the minor actors are fairly shoddy ie: the doctor is pretty awful. At times, the editing and camerawork is a little off ie: 180 degree lines are noticably broken, cuts involving creative geography are often unintentionally jarring since it tends to leave out things like the front of a house. Arguably that could be to further the jarring effect of the film. I doubt it though, seeing as these were first time filmmakers. I was also disappointed with all the loose ends at the end of the movie. Despite some flaws, this movie is quite recommended. A little predictable but definitely of interest for pretty much everyone who want a scary movie thats a little offbeat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just seen this movie for the second time and love it twice as much. The great thing about it is that it's quiet and dreamlike and there's absolutely no blood or gore or real violence. And it's in black and white-you can't beat that! I assume you all know the story very well, a story I find to be most intriguing and not at all as predictable and plain as everyone makes it out to be. Mary Henry and her friends sail off a bridge, although Mary is mysteriously unscathed. After that, while dealing with her job as a church organist and various other characters, she is pursued by a devilishly delicious zombie and goes through periods of complete estrangement from the world. And then of course there's her neighbor Mr. Linden. He's so greasy and sex-crazed that I couldn't help but love him, and he makes an excellent contrast against Candace Hilligoss's solitary, quiet character. Their scenes together are eerie just on their own(Linden spying on a changing Mary and the attempted-necking scene infront of the mirror) Mary is also drawn toward an old pavillion where her eventual end takes place, and that too is eerie. Her periods of silence are probably the creepiest of the movie, almost claustrophobic and especially dreadful. I mean-who wants to be in broad daylight and feel like they're the last person on earth while practically going deaf? All in all, let's just put it this way. I'm an old movie guru, so this is obviously going to pertain to me more than The Sixth Sense and all those other gore fests, and even so, you can't help but love this movie. I'll be treasuring it for a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~ Bizarre is the word. It's the best word to describe Carnival of Souls. It's an oddball cult classic that can get under your skin...if you let it. There's something appealing about it at the same time. Director Herk Harvey was onto something here (and M. Night Shyamalan owes him a lot). He had a cinematic vision that was way ahead of its time. He delivered a puzzling, disquieting, nightmare-esque horror film filled to the brim with eerie imagery. And he did it in 1962. I was thoroughly impressed with the film. You're never quite sure what's going on (even if you did see the ending coming from a mile away). There are many things that are out of place and it never seems to feel real. Like I said, it's a weird one. All this blends together to give the movie its definite staying power. It's a pity that Harvey never had another success, but I think that adds more to the cult quality of the film (he makes a creepy zombie too). Carnival of Souls is a surreal experience that's not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CARNIVAL OF SOULS (1962) Starring Candace Hilligoss, Frances Feist, Sidney Berger, Art Ellison,Stan Levitt Directed by Herk HarveyIf you're one of the many (too many) who haven't seen this little gem,let me just tell you: This is the best film you've never seen.Made in 1962 by Herk Harvey, an industrial film maker in Lawrence,Kansas for a ridiculously tiny budget, CARNIVAL OF SOULS is a cultmasterpiece. Harvey shot most of the film locally (a few scenes wereshot near Salt Lake City), and used local talent. In fact, some of thecast were also members of the crew.The story opens with young Mary Henry and her girlfriends drag racingagainst some boys. When the cars reach an old bridge, the girls's carplunges over the side and into the river. While police and onlookerssearch the river for signs of the car, Mary emerges from the water. She's wet, muddy and in shock. She decides to put her past behind herand takes a job in Utah, playing the organ at a church. On her way toUtah, she passed an old deserted carnival on Salt Lake. It's a spookyimage and intrigues Mary for reasons she cannot fathom. She also seesthe image of a ghostly face outside her car window. This creepy mancontinues to plague her, showing up numerous times after she arrives ather new home. She doesn't know what the man wants with her, nor canshe explain her own increasingly odd behavior.CARNIVAL OF SOULS has very little in the way of special effects, but itdoesn't need them. Harvey and crew create such a nightmarishatmosphere and such compelling visuals that this film will keep youthinking long after the final credits have rolled. Viewers who haveseen Roger Corman's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968) will definitelynotice the influence that CARNIVAL OF SOULS had on that film.I have always loved this film, but lamented the limited sources fromwhich to obtain it. For years it was available only in abargain-basement VHS edition. A few years ago I was fortunate enoughto see CARNIVAL OF SOULS on the big screen in Kansas City. Many of thecast and crew were present to discuss the film and answer questions. While nothing can compare to that, the average viewer is much morefortunate today because CARNIVAL OF SOULS is available on DVD. Irecommend The Criterion Collection's 2-disc set.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film of Herk Harvey is a gem of cult, a unique product, considering that the director never would film again due to the commercial failure of this prime opera. A true pity, since from the titles we are in front of an absolutely original and punctilious piece of work, as much in the aesthetic aspect as in casting and the production. A calm little town as many in the average American west, in the early ' 60s. A race cars between boys and girls that finishes in tragedy. The car of the young people falls from a bridge to the river and apparently all suffocates. But Mary Henry leaves the water. Later she obtains a solitary job as an organist in the church of a near town. Her life seems to take control again , when Mary begins to have strange visions of macabre figures... but her will is put under taste more .Mary is a cold of great clear eyes, independent and distant blonde; . In fact, the personage of Mary is few years subsequent to the one of the blondes of Psychosis and Vertigo, even a doctor appears who does the times of psychiatrist, who resembles films of the great British director again. and three years previous to the one of Catherine Deneuve in Repulsion, of Polanski;(the personal style of the film it just remains me o a Polanski film,I wonder if he saw this movie) been compared to Wild Strawberries-era Ingmar Bergman and the dreamstates of Jean Cocteau. Nevertheless, the carnival of the souls has with all these titles a great climate affinity and characters; . I cannot say more; The carnival of the souls is dream like, hypnotic, frightful per moments, always disquieting is a total experience. Notice the ballroom scene of the macabre people(In fast motion). Shot on location in and around the spectacular Saltair pavilion (since destroyed by fire), and the soundtrack is pretty creepy too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carnival of souls (1962) is that rare thing in life. An intelligent and genuinely unsettling horror film. Where most horror films go for the obvious effects of gore and leave nothing to the imagination, this film takes a far more subtle approach. The film deals with the story of a withdrawn church organist Mary (Candice Hilligloss) who is involved in a car crash from which she is the only survivor. She then finds herself being pursued by a strange ghoulish looking man and has episodes where it appears no one around her can see or hear her. This leads to a startling revelation for Mary at the old abandoned Carnival in the desert.What makes this film so good is its eerie atmosphere and the strong visual influence of German expressionist cinema, mixed with some pretty good photography (for such a low budget) and good performances from a mainly non-professional cast, results in a fine example of how to unnerve an audience without big budgets and special effects.The film can also be seen as being a major influential on other such films as David Lynch's Eraserhead (1976) and George Romero's Night of the living dead (1968).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great little gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> Herk Harvey and Candace Hilligoss are not household names to most persons and for good reason. Their body of work outside of this film is tragically low. I say tragically because Harvey as the film's producer/director and Hilligoss as the female lead were the main reason Carnival of Souls is remembered today as it is. Carnival of Souls is a great little gem and, I would say, a masterpiece of it's genre. Shot on a very low budget in 1962, much of it was filmed in Lawrence, Kansas, where the University of Kansas is located and where one of it's leading players (Speech instructor Sidney Berger as Ms. Hilligoss' `love interest') was on the teaching staff. Harvey also appeared as the mysterious apparition throughout the story. The story concerns a young woman, Hilligoss as Mary Henry, who has evidently survived an automobile plunging off of a bridge and into deep water. After being rescued, Mary begins to see the apparition, impressively played by Harvey in a low key, understated manner, and notices that there are times when she cannot be seen or heard by those around her. Harvey is truly outstanding, made up to look as a zombie with hollow, piercing eyes. Hilligoss as Mary is equally impressive as the strong-willed yet strangely vulnerable Mary. Hilligoss was an attractive, if not beautiful woman, and perfect for the role as Mary. Carnival of Souls is one of those films that worked, and worked well, almost in spite of itself. On the surface it would not appear that it had much going for it. Mary's adventures take her to a boarding house where she receives the mostly unwanted attentions of her lecherous neighbor, John, capably played by Berger. She accepts a job as a church organist, giving Harvey the perfect in to include some very eerie music within the story, and is mysteriously drawn to an old amusement park, where she experiences the dances of the dead, the film's most impressive scenes. Eventually she is drawn outside the abandoned ballroom to the beach and claimed as one of their own by the party of zombies, confirming what we have suspected all along. Mood, atmosphere and creative camera work set this film apart, a film which was ahead of its time as was 1968's Night of the Living Dead. Carnival of Souls is greater than the sum of its parts, as all things excellent must always be. It is a pity we did not see more of Herk Harvey or Candace Hilligoss. Horror buffs will always wonder, what if? .. Still, I believe it preferable to do a single masterpiece rather than a large body of the forgettable. Perhaps they were wise and understood that this was the one great work allotted them. I hope this is the case but we will never know. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent psychological horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the fact that there were a group of zombie-like beings in this movie, this is still very much a psychological horror movie. And a good one, at that. The acting is kind of cheesy at times, but it does well enough. The story is a simple on to follow, but still interesting. The lead zombie had some creepy make-up that was still, like the story, simple.From a technical standpoint, the print of the film was excellent. Practically, crystal clear (which is pretty amazing considering it's a $6 DVD with two movies on it). The dubbing on the film was pretty bad at times, especially near the beginning. Some of the camera work was very imaginative and quite good for a low budget ?60s horror flick.Now for the problems, not that there were many, but there were some. The score, while pretty eerie, also got annoying after a while. Screeching organ music through the entire movie for the most part. Of course, there was the bad dubbing, which at times was absolutely horrible, with characters talking and their lips weren't even moving. The acting, like I said above, was cheesy at times, which I would blame on the actors, in part.Carnival of Souls is a good psychological horror movie well worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Muted, low key American horror which had great influence on future trends.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eerie, low budget, black and white American horror - film begins with a car carrying 3 women, which is forced off a bridge and crashes into the river below. One of the women apparently survives, walking unscathed out of the water. Story follows her, as she moves away to a new job as a church organist, where she encounters a variety of odd characters, and one spectral figure in particular.Short, low-key, strange film builds up an impressive atmosphere, although this does result in long periods of no dialogue and little real narrative. The film built up a cult following, and is said to have influenced Romero when making 'Night of the Living Dead' - not in terms of story, but certainly the cold detached method of filming is similar, as are the camera angles, muted performances, and dulled sound. Some of these aspects of the film were no doubt due to budget restrictions, but the effects they have are utilised for the films overall effect.While only being of average interest from a viewers point of view, 'Carnival of Souls' set certain distinctions which independent American horror films followed for a decade or more. The ending delivers the goods also, even if it is somewhat telegraphed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low Budget Cult Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long before "The Blair Witch Project" showed Hollywood that low-budget, independent films can be entertaining, well crafted, and scary, there was "Carnival of Souls". It's part campy fun and part no-frills fright for anyone fortunate enough to catch this nearly forgotten 60's horror film. It's not nearly as scary as Blair Witch, but director Herk Harvey put together an excellent independent project that's as notable for good elements: genuine 60s atmosphere and quirky supporting players as it is for its bad elements: uneven pacing, and editing. As with any cult classic, there are small details that make the film an original. I love the shots of extras stopping to listen to the organ music. Carnival of Souls has several humorous moments, some unintentional: check out the scene where Mary almost gets run down by a van in an alley.This film is well worth the 84 minute run time. It's great entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really care about the creepy or eerie side of it. For me, this very low budget film got what a lot of today's films don't have : imagination. This story had surely something to do with 1940's Val Newton productions. But it got a very unique twist of it's own. Camera work is from times to times very inventive, so is the way director Harvey use shadows. What's more unique is that this is the only movie of Harvey, and the first of the only two young actress Hilligross will ever made. A movie ahead of it's time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching "Carnival of Souls" on my local PBS station has become a tradition for me. Having watched it yet again this year I find that I continue to enjoy this eerie, haunting tale of a woman balancing on the edge between life and death, sanity and madness, existence and non-existence. Throughout the movie Mary, the lead character, moves in out and out of these parallels while plagued by ghoulish zombies (particularly the "Man") until the final scene where we wonder if those she encountered since her automobile accident (e.g., the minister, the doctor) and even we, the viewers, became a part of her bizarre reality while she totters on this edge. I've always felt that horror movies like this one are more effective when filmed in black &amp; white, leaving the fright to the imagination rather than attempting to produce it through scenes of blood, guts &amp; gore. This is one of the best B/W classic horror films for it's cinematography, locations (i.e., the boarding house, the church &amp; the dilapidated pavilion), and haunting music. The scene where Mary seems possessed while playing the church organ is phenomenal. Like the lead character in the 1963 classic, "The Haunting," Mary is one chosen and must accept her eventual fate. The film is called a cult movie because it was a low budget, B-movie first released in 1962 and apparently it's fan following grows each year. That's wonderful and I'm glad to a part of that cult following.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This little 1962 independent film was sadly over looked in its initial release.Thanks to video and another theatrical release in 1989 the film has finally gotten overdue recognition. A drag race turns deadly when car with three girls in it flips off a bridge into the Kansas(?)River.For 3 hours the river is dragged with no luck.Then Mary Henry comes out of the water onto a muddy sand bar. While Mary behaves strangely after this it seems that she was a cold aloof person to begin with.She leaves town immediately to take on a new job as a church organist in Utah.Driving through the salt flats late that night she happens to glance at the passenger side window.A ghoulish man is staring at her &amp; she promptly runs off the road.(Yeah and I would have dropped some skippy chips too).Gathering her wits and getting the car back on the road she notices a deserted pavillion in the flats and is drawn to it for some unknown reason. When she gets to town things start to get very weird for her. The ghoulish man seems to be dogging her every movement.While trying on a new dress Mary suddenly can't hear a thing.She leaves the dressing room and tries to communicate with shoppers/sales clerks etc and they act as if she isn't there.The ghoul is also following her.  At organ practice Mary is suddenly possessed by an evil force that causes her to play demonic music.She is promptly fired.When she tries to leave town all goes silent again.She tries to catch a bus but it is full of ghoulish people.(The Greyhound from Hell). Mary makes her way to the pavillion she is so drawn to. There she is confronted by a crowd of ghouls that chase her out into the flats.I won't give away the ending so you'll have to see it yourself. Being a low budget film the acting for the most part is mawkish.There is only one "sore" spot as Mary tries to connect with a pig of man.We already knew that she had difficulty relating to people but this guy is a loser.Who would want to be close to him? This film could be about how detached we are from one another (the scenes of silence and inability to communicate with others).There is a lot of religious symbolism in this movie.Mary doesn't believe very strongly in the church although it is her job to play music in one.There seems to be a constant struggle between life and death with the emphasis on death.Nothing is what it seems. The imagery is stunning from the opening title scene to the very end.While this movie isn't scary it is extremely creepy and has scenes you won't soon forget.The black &amp; white filming just enhances the moodiness of the film.The deserted pavillion filled with madly dancing ghouls is stunning.Images of ghouls rising out of murky water with insane knowing grins is chilling.The organ music is outstanding and in some cases downright spooky. This gem is required for patient viewers. You won't be grossed out.But you'll be creeped out watching this at night.You may never look at water the same way again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This low budget (and I do mean LOW budget) horror classic is worth a look. You should be able to rent it (I did). It's very stark, the sound and film quality aren't the best. Don't expect Lord Olivier acting or slow-motion spirits. If it wasn't made so long ago, I would have suspected it was made with a camcorder.It's a very different kind of movie, eerie in different ways than most. It's really "out there". It's not a dialog driven movie, but it gets the message across loud and clear. I would recommend NOT watching it on a stormy night, alone in an empty house. You'll have the lights on the rest of the night.It's very difficult to rate "Carnival of Souls". I gave it a 9 out of 10, but that's me. Don't expect alot and be entertained (and scared). Expect too much and you may be disappointed. I've often run into people who rate movies by appearance or in comparison to state of the art today, instead of a film's own worth in it's own day....</fullReview>

Sort of like a purgatory on earth. Super pacing done by director Harvey and a good amount of chills throughout the entire movie. Some of the more powerful scenes include the unexpected glimpses of a cadaverous man(Director Harvey) at times when you least expect it as he "pursues" the heroine. The "possessed" organ playing scene at the church and of course the abandoned seaside pavillion and it's "dancers of death". This is sort of an extended episode of the underrated TV series "One Step Beyond". An outstanding little fright flick. Prepare for the constant goosebumps!</fullReview>

This is a genuine work of art. Director Herk Harvey can unsettle you deeply without any special effects or cheap shock tricks. And what an ending! If it doesn't give you goosebumps, you're immune.

		<fullReview>Herk Harvey's "Carnival of Souls" has got to be one of the most blood-freezing movies that I've ever seen. Not necessarily scary, but definitely eerie, in that one can't fully explain what happens. It begins when three young women drive their car into a river, and only Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) survives. She then moves to a small town in Utah where she's been hired as a church organist. But on the way to Utah is where things start getting creepy: a ghostly man keeps appearing, and only Mary can see him. Arriving in Utah, not only does the horrific man keep appearing, but Mary suffers some instances where it seems as though she suddenly doesn't exist. But the real question about these mysterious occurrences is: how does an abandoned lakeside pavilion relate to all this? Apparently, director Harvey - who shot the movie on a nearly shoestring budget - wanted the movie to look like a mixture of the work of Jean Cocteau and Ingmar Bergman; I haven't seen enough of their films to comment on that. But I can say that this is more than a B-movie. One might describe it as similar to a "Twilight Zone" episode, but I don't know how to elucidate it thoroughly. Throughout my life, I've had ideas mildly similar to the events depicted here. However, this goes beyond any of that. You may just have doubts about your own sanity after watching this. The half-hour documentary on the Criterion Collection DVD about the movie and its cult following should further clarify things.On a side note, I bet that if the Utahns had known about some of the scenes in this movie, they wouldn't have allowed it to get filmed in their state. I'm talking about certain shots of Candace Hilligoss (and she is really hot!).</fullReview>

She takes a drive to Utah to be the organist of a church, but having the visions while she plays, she accidentally plays music that is against the church and is asked to renounce.I thought that this was one of the greatest budget film I've ever seen. As opposed to the Plan 9 Of outer space that was a completely horrible movie, this movie had really made sense. I love how the main eyes of character widen when she sees a strange man and she is frightened. Also in the end when they found the car, she returns in the car where her friends died as if she have herself killed.I recommend this movie for any thriller lover!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Herk Harvey's Carnival Of Souls is one of the most unusual and influential horror films of the 1960s. The film has lost some of its spark with the passing of time but still holds up as an excellent early example of a supernatural horror movie that takes itself seriously. There is no sense of whimsy about Carnival Of Souls. From the spectacular opening to the legendary conclusion, the film never wavers in its grim tone. It is Harvey's ability to present supernatural occurrences in a realistic manner that makes Carnival Of Souls a stepping stone to the horror classics of the 1970s.The first indication that this is no ordinary horror film is the opening car chase sequence. Carnival Of Souls literally begins with a bang as a car full of young women race against a group of teenage delinquents and crash spectacularly over a bridge. The race is filmed with a precision and grace that is almost poetic. The close-ups of Mary's terrified face set the haunting tone which only gets stronger as Mary emerges from the water as the sole survivor of the crash. The crash appears to have broken something in Mary; she vacantly announces that she is leaving town to take up a new job and vows never to return.The film hits its stride when Mary begins to see things which blur the line between reality and insanity. Herk Harvey exploits the fear of madness better than most directors. While some of the ghost effects look dated, Mary's self doubt, confusion and desperation remain compelling. Life goes from bad to worse for Mary as she becomes increasingly disturbed by her hallucinatory experiences and becomes increasingly self-destructive. Carnival Of Souls keeps an ace up its sleeve, as the film moves from psychological to physical horror in its classic conclusion.Few films have conveyed a character's internal torment as lyrically as Carnival Of Souls. The scene where Mary wanders the streets in a trance, unable to communicate with the world around her, is hypnotic and beautifully filmed. Mary's visit with Dr. Samuels is equally revealing. This character is basically an empty vessel, which makes her desperate attachment to her sleazy neighbour believable and her increasingly bizarre behaviour understandable. Harvey, who had a career making industrial "how to" films before turning to features, directs the movie with a crispness and style that is simply beautiful. The years he spent making documentaries has obviously influenced his approach to film-making. For what is essentially a ghost movie, Carnival Of Souls is steeped in reality - from Mary's psychological unravelling, to the desperate characters she meets along the way.Harvey's lasting legacy is the film's conclusion. This sequence has been cited by a plethora of horror directors as being influential and George A. Romero readily admits to borrowing heavily from this portion of the film in his own masterpiece, "Night Of The Living Dead". The zombies in that film not only resemble the ghouls in Carnival Of Souls, but Barbra's initial flight from the zombies is clearly inspired by Mary's fate. The lasting impact of this sequence can be seen by the constant plundering of the film's final twist in everything from "The Others" to "The Sixth Sense".Carnival Of Souls has aged in a way that "Night Of The Living Dead", for example, has not. The film has taken on a camp quality due to the poor nature of some of the special effects and Mary's behaviour, which is very much in tune with the mores of the 1960s. However, age has not wearied the film's hypnotic, dreamlike tone or Harvey's steadfastly serious approach to the most unrealistic of subject matters. And then there is the film's rousing finale, which has lost none of its considerable bite. This classic deserves your attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cult film that gets to your subconscious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this on TV in the 1970s and the final scene shot at Saltair in Salt Lake City is a classic of camp horror that seeps into your subconscious. With a motivation of nostalgia I attended the revived film festival screening in 1989."Carnival of Souls" has become a cult classic and the DVD release contains everything you could possibly want to know about the film and then some. How director Herk Harvey got the original idea based on the Saltair locale, and how John Clifford wrote the script. As a low budget film it succeeds on many levels, the story being a version of the '40s Mercury Theater episode "The Hitchhiker" and the '50s Twilight Zone treatment. Candace Hilligoss was a Lee Strasberg method actor when she got the offer to star in this film set in Lawrence, Kansas and Salt Lake City, Utah. She was paid $2000, the only member of cast or crew to see any real money from the original film.The amateurishness of certain aspects of the film also are part of its charm. The beginning uses voice-overs that are completely out of sync and you can see the car is empty as it goes over the bridge, but when the lead character Mary comes up on shore after the car/bridge accident the otherworldly feel of the film starts to take over. The Gothic pipe organ building sets the atmosphere, and as she makes her way to Salt Lake City the ghoul (Herk Harvey) starts to appear. Also of interest is the in town scenes where we get a good glimpse of 1961 street scenes. One scene doesn't quite gel with the rest of the film, namely the scene where Mr. Berger (John Linden) brings Mary coffee in the morning. She is so bubbly with dialogue such as, "You're just what I needed this morning", that she seems a completely different character than that in the rest of the film. But as the ghoul keeps appearing and she keeps getting drawn to the carnival the scenes of mysteriousness that make this a great film get underway. The Saltair building scenes are classic, an abandoned dance hall and amusement park full of ghoulish ghosts. The fast-motion dancing ghouls and the end where they run past and jump up in front of the camera predate the same feel of Night of the Living Dead by 7 years. As Mary wanders through the abandoned park, the true atmospheric essence comes to the fore.Much can be read into the theme of someone caught in a dimension between life and death, from the quantum theory of Schoedinger's Cat to the Many Worlds theory to ideas of purgatory, etc. However as the writer admits the deeper aspects were not considered by him. In the many world's theory we die in one dimension, but not in another. If the dimensions overlap the death dimension can influence and change the life one.A few things to watch for: When Hilligoss is running from the ghouls at the end she is happily smiling the whole time. At the end you can see how the girls in the car, supposedly dead, are twitching (look for the middle one twitching her eyes)...then again they were in cold water. Its weird because in an outtake scene they are not moving. The priest fires Mary because her playing is "profane". Well the playing doesn't really sound profane to me, and either way it's not a convincing reason to fire someone. The DVD outtakes contain some good extra scenes of the ghouls in the bathhouse, and some extra footage of Mary wandering through Saltair. If you're into 1960s horror films with substance and atmosphere, this is at the top of the list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Well-Made Eerie Horror Film From 1962</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carnival Of Souls (1962): Starring Candace Hilligros, Sidney Berger, Frances Feist, Art Ellison, Stan Levitt, Tom McGinnis, Forbes Caldwell, Dan Palmquist, Bill de Jarnette, Ste Boozer, Pamela Ballard, Larry Sneegas, Cari Conboy, Karen Pyles...Director Herk Harvey, Screenplay John Clifford.Released in 1962, not long after master of horror and suspense Alfred Hitchhock's "Psycho", Herk Harvey's "Carnival Of Souls" was the first movie of its kind. This was a horror film which did not need excess, i.e. excess blood, scream queens, violence, crazed killers, demons, gore, vulgarity, etc, which would become a staple of horror films in the 70' and 80's. What we have here is quite possibly the first "Zombie" horror flick, without any of the non-sense that usually accompanies such films. Candace Hilligros stars as Mary Henry, the lone survivor of a drag race accident. When we see the car with three women fall into the lake, we assume everyone has died but minutes later Mary emerges bloodless and unharmed. But everything after that seems strange and out-of-place. No one recognizes her and she is a stranger in her own hometown. Frances Feist is Mrs. Thomas, her landlady, who is polite and courteous to her despite the odd circumstances. Sidney Berger is Jon Linden, a neighbor who is sexually drawn to Mary but whose advances she refuses. Art Ellison is the minister, who finds work for Mary as Church organist, as she has a talent for playing the organ. This is a dreamy, surreal type of film that requires the viewer to take special notice of every detail. There is a big twist at the end and while I own't give it away, I will say it's the same twist at the end of 1999's "The Sixth Sense" by director M. Night Shamylan. The cinematography is exquisite, providing a combination of realism and surrealism. Note how Mary is inexplicably drawn to the abandoned Amusement Park (Saltair Amusement Park outside Salt Lake City, Utah)where we catch a brief glimpse of a zombie (Cary Conboy) lurking beneath the lake. Zombies are present everywhere, following Mary around, particularly one (T.C. Adams). She is finally caught in a world of Zombies who dance and frolic in the Amusement Park at night. She has become one of them..A great film and enjoyable in many ways. The acting and the dialogue may not be great stuff (in early and even later horror films, dialog and acting is always cheesy). But even this doesn't detract from the overall greatness of this film. Besides, there is a lot of silence in this film, at times becoming a sort of creepy silent film, the only sound for the most part being the haunting and powerful organ music. This is one of the better horror films of its time, that is of course, until "Night of the Living Dead" by director Romero appeared in theaters and changed the face of horror cinema.</fullReview>

It's one of the greatest films I ever saw, even though few people appreciate that. To my hatred, quite a lot people left the theater before it was finished?oh well, it's their loss they can't see the low-budget genius of this film. **** Small plot-spoilers coming up **** Being the sole survivor of a car accident, Mary tries to rebuild her life by accepting a job as a church organist in Utah. From the moment she's on the road, she's being haunted by ghostly apparitions and extremely bizarre events. Mary keeps on having visions of a scary, white-faced man and on top of that, she sometimes becomes completely invisible and inaudible to the people around her!! Descending further into isolation and insanity, Mary is attracted by the remainders of an old carnival?She goes there, hoping to find an explanation for the strange things that overcome her lately. **** End spoilers ****Carnival of Souls is unique and it almost feels like pure Expressionism! This modest 60's film contains striking camera viewpoints and the chilly black and white eeriness heighten the atmosphere even more. Words almost can't describe how real this entire nightmare feels! The slow and sober style Herk Harvey implements in his movie grab you by the throat constantly (by the way, the director can't be recognized in the film as the ghoul who appears everywhere). Although the budget and expedients for making this film might have been limited, the Carnival scenery ? and especially the dance-hall ? is effectively creepy and hypnotizing. I suppose the reason why I worship this title is because it's a imaginative triumph?Carnival of Souls is an immensely story-driven escapade of illusions, anti-socialism and it approaches the topic of `near death experiences' really well. Like no other director ever achieved before, Harvey creates a nightmarish world even David Lynch would be jealous of. No wonder this film formed a huge inspiration for his later work?as well as George A. Romero's? Truly, this is a film you'll never forget. Many sequences will be burnt on your retina for ever. Is there a rating higher than 10 out of 10???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little flawed, but quite fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After surviving a car accident, a woman awakes with little memory of the incident only to be haunted by a ghoulish figure stalking her and tormenting her as she continues to find out what happened.This here wasn't all that bad but did have some problems with it. The atmosphere here is pretty evocative and haunting, making for some pretty innovative images here and there that really do get a touch creepier than what would be expected in such a film, and it's definitely creepy enough that the scenes of utter weirdness and just plain out-there ideas work for the most part, especially in the last part where there's a lot of chasing going on. The main thing that held this one down, beyond the fact that the low-budget does show through incredibly easily, was the fact that there's just not a whole lot of anything interesting going on while she's not being tormented by the ghostly visions. There's no mystery being investigated, there's not a spark to find out what's going on, and instead it just contends to have her moan and complain about it without doing much about it. That really makes it drag on in the middle parts, even more so due to the fact that it spends a lot of time with her in church just wasting time with her playing and not doing anything. Still, it's not too bad if just somewhat flawed.Today's Rating-Unrated/PG: Mild Violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahead of Its Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A compelling film that was ahead of its time. Made in 1962 within a period of only 3 weeks and on a shoe-string budget, this film was not a major draw at the box office. Even so Candace Hilligoss (as "Mary Henry") puts on a fine performance as an attractive blonde who appears to be suffering from emotional damage after the car she was riding in plunges into a river killing her two companions. Oddly enough, she comes out of the river 3 hours after dredging operations have begun with no real memory of how she survived. About a week after the accident, she decides she needs to leave town and takes a job as an organist at a church in Utah. On the way there she begins to hear strange organ music and has hallucinations about people she has never met. She also mysteriously feels drawn to a nearby carnival on the outskirts of town. My favorite scene is when she goes to practice at the church and is suddenly propelled into a trance and involuntarily starts playing eerie music as if she is possessed. Later she is told by a lustful suitor named "John Linden" (played by Sidney Berger), that her entire personality is "cold". And she is. Deathly cold. All in all I found this to be quite enjoyable and would heartedly recommend it for those who are looking for a classic horror movie from days gone by.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carnival of Corpses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Carnival of Souls" qualifies as a rather creepy, psychological, low-budget chiller that doesn't rely on conspicuous artifice other than the cosmetic variety to achieve its ends. Less functions as more in freshman director Herk Harvey's one and only theatrical feature. This is not the kind of horror movie that will keep you awake at night with the lights on and a crucifix in your fist. Ostensibly, the story deals with a young, single woman who appears to be the soul survivor of an automobile accident on a bridge. She is riding in one car with two other girls when another car nudges them during a game of chicken. The two guys in the other car watch in surprise as the vehicle plunges off the bridge and crashes into a river. Miraculously, our heroine Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) emerges from a muddy river and decides to leave town. She is a gifted organist and takes a job as organist at an out-of-town church. She rents a room at a boarding house run by a little, old lady. Later, she meets an obnoxious warehouse laborer, John Linden (Sidney Berger), who takes an immediate interest in her that she doesn't reciprocate. As it turns out, Mary is more secular than religious. She takes the job for the money that she can make. When the minister (Art Ellison) catches her playing sacrilegious tunes on the organ, he gives her the boot. The next thing you know, Mary accompanies Linden on a date out to juke joint. The date concludes with Mary abandoning Linden. Wherever Mary goes, she winds up seeing either cadaverous people or walking among people who are sealed off in another world. Briefly, a well-intentioned physician, Dr. Samuel (Stan Levitt) struggles to help Mary with no success. Naturally, nobody around her can figure out what Mary's problem is. Harvey concludes this enigmatic outing with rescue workers excavating the automobile in which Mary rode from the river. She is as lifeless as her two companions."Carnival of Souls" takes advantage of several interesting locations, principally Saltair Amusement Park, near, Magna, Utah. Indeed, this sumptuous setting does for this movie what the Overlook Hotel did for Stanley Kubrick's chiller "The Shining." Although the wooden performances don't bolster this evocative, haunting movie, "Carnival of Souls" is difficult to take your eyes off. Maurice Prather's plain but fresh black &amp; white photography is stimulating stuff. Prather and Harvey make this little, 78-minute opus look hypnotic with a variety of intriguing camera angles that enhance scenarist John Clifford's Spartan screenplay. The downbeat ending and the dearth of exposition sabotage what is otherwise an interesting, almost poetic film. You will have to decide if everything that happens between the time the car falls into the river and the workers pull it out as the last thoughts caroming around inside the heroine's skull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exercise in dream-like ambiance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a film shot in three weeks with a shoe-string budget, it really is quite extraordinary how well Carnival of Souls turned out. While the storyline isn't anything too special and some of the acting is not very good, the film possesses an incredible imagination and a look and feel that elevate it way above most of its peers. It concerns the aftermath of a car crash, where the one survivor (Candace Hilligoss) emerges from the depths of the river-bank only to immediately start to experience all manner of otherworldly events, including regular visions of a strange and ominous amorphous man.Director Herk Harvey only ever did make this one feature film, which clearly is very unfortunate, as he displays considerable ability and ambition. The very dreamy nature of the film is really extremely well done. The camera-work is consistently good, with all manner of unusual angles and some highly effective freeze-frame stop-motion work that gives the scenes with the ghouls a very strange feel. The over-all ambiance of the movie is dreamy and weird; this is helped immeasurably by some great locations like the organ factory, the shopping mall and especially the remote carnival. This latter location is perfect for the final scenes and typifies the overall feeling that the film aims for. What helps set Carnival of Souls apart from most horror films of the time is that it just doesn't resemble any other one very much at all. It's a mood-piece as much as anything, and seems to be a genuine attempt at an art film. The look, the music and the feel are all very distinctive indeed. It only has one clear weakness and that is the scenes involving the neighbour over the hall. These parts are highly clunky, with bad dialogue. The actor playing the neighbour was a very annoying presence and his relationship with Candace Hilligoss's character was both unconvincing and completely pointless. This whole segment could have quite easily been removed with no damage to the film over all. But to a certain extent this is splitting hairs because these scenes withstanding, Carnival of Souls remains a highly atmospheric and original supernatural thriller. It's a great example of what impressive things can be achieved with so very little money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low budget classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to cult classics of the horror genre, I lump Carnival Of Souls into the same category as Night Of The Living Dead (1968). This movie had an extremely low budget - it was made for $30,000, or $17,000, depending on the source. Whatever it was, it was dirt cheap to make. But in my opinion, sometimes low budget movies are better than the polished big budget movies with top-of-the-line actors and special effects. When it comes to horror movies, a small amount of money can produce the same desired result as big budget movies, which is to scare the audience. The goal is to create an eerie and spooky and scary atmosphere that taps into a person's feelings of fear. You really don't need a lot of money to accomplish this. A lot of low budget B horror movies are very effective. Carnival Of Souls is one of them.This movie was shot in Lawrence, Kansas and also at the Saltair Pavilion amusement park in Salt Lake City, Utah. This movie stars Candace Hilligoss as Mary Henry, a church organist who survives a car accident in which her two girl companions died. The accident was the result of a car full of guys challenging the girls to a drag race. The race turns tragic as the car goes off a bridge and plunges into a river below. Her two companions die in the accident, but Mary somehow survives basically unscathed. She then goes to Salt Lake City and takes a new job playing organ in a church. Throughout the movie, she often sees the ghostly image of a man (played by director Herk Harvey) practically everywhere she goes. This man seems to be haunting her. Nobody else but her sees this man. It isn't long before she seems to become non-existent to the people around her, all of whom don't see or hear her. Along the way, a fellow tenant named John (played by Sidney Berger) who lives across the hall from her takes a great interest in her. At first she pushes him away, then at other times she wants to be with him and goes out to dinner with him. But at one point he realizes that she is "off her rocker" and storms out of the room and never sees her again. Mary seems to be scared of unknown forces throughout the movie. It also seems as if what is living and what is dead is a blur to her. She can't tell the difference. She basically is caught between the living and the dead. She is even haunted by her own organ music, which changes from happier tones early in the movie to more sinister and darker tones while she's practicing at the church one night. It seems as though ever since she saw the pavilion she became drawn to it. As a result, she falls into a trance and sees, in her mind, zombies coming out of the water near the pavilion to delight in her sinister organ music. Suddenly the church minister appears out of nowhere and disapproves of her organ playing and fires her. At first it appears she's still in a trance. Then it becomes apparent that she's probably in shock about being fired.Near the end, it seems as if Mary has been dreaming about these zombies at the abandoned carnival. The end of the movie has a bizarre ending that I won't reveal. Watch it to find out what happens.This movie's score is 100% theater organ, performed by Gene Moore. That's it - an organ. The organ music is eerie throughout the movie and seems to be off key a lot of the time (intentionally, of course) and has an underlying, subtle carnival melody during a lot of the scenes at the pavilion. I must say I'm surprised that Candace Hilligoss only appeared in one other movie (The Curse Of The Living Corpse in 1964). She is nice looking, has very good screen presence, and can act pretty well.This movie can be classified as having subtle, atmospheric psychological horror. This movie has no blood and gore. Instead, the music, camera angles, lighting, howling winds, shadows, and feeling of emptiness make this movie creepy.This movie has been influential to many horror movie makers, including George Romero and John Carpenter. Notice how Herk Harvey (the man who keeps haunting Mary) appears in windows and then disappears. Michael Myers appears in windows and then disappears in Halloween (1978).Do you like low budget B horror movies that are influential cult classics? Do you like simplicity when it comes to horror movies? Do you like horror movies involving carnivals? If so, then check out Carnival Of Souls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Herk Harvey horror...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Herk Harvey's horror masterpiece pretty much set the tone for low budget black and white fright films of the 1960s (NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, among others, appears to have been inspired- at least in part- by CARNIVAL OF SOULS): an uneasy ambiance is achieved and maintained throughout; CARNIVAL OF SOULS never falters. While the storyline owes more than a little to several episodes of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, the overall effect is even more unsettling. Candace Hilligoss conveys her torment exceptionally well as she's shadowed with deliberate inevitability by the pale, ghostly figure from the old, abandoned carnival. The dream-like denouement at the Danse Macabre is classic. Want to see a genuinely spooky movie? Check out CARNIVAL OF SOULS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought a DVD that has 15 horror films; Carnival of Souls was one of it. Before I started this movie I wasn't expecting much, I was very wrong. This movie was like a creepy dream, you didn't know if the main character was hallucinating or if it was real. The ghouls that were chasing the main character had raccoon makeup (Black makeup around the eyes, black lipstick, pale makeup on the face.), some how it made the ghouls very creepy. Spoiler: In two scenes the main character seem to been invisible to people, and they can't hear them. I guessed that she might be dead and her spirit is walking around, I was right.

		<shortDescription>Hilligoss, Clifford and Herks work was not in vain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a car accident a woman is haunted by a terrifying ghoul. A true horror classic, director Herk Harvey and writer John Clifford both waived their earnings in order to get the film made. Upon release in 1962 the film was a failure in the box office, thankfully its subsequent airings on late night television helped to gain it a strong cult following so Clifford and Herks work was not all in vain.The delightful Candace Hilligoss is perfectly cast as the troubled woman that after surviving a traumatic car accident, that kills her two friends, becomes haunted by a frightening ghoul and drawn to a mysterious abandoned carnival. It's a shame that Hilligoss only acted in two features as she gives an impressive performance as Mary Henry who is refreshingly independent thinking and self-sufficient pushing boundaries of 1960's America.The music is very creepy and a little too intrusive in places, however, for it's time and budget it is a well crafted film. Carnival of Souls many not be as sleek and stylish as the Haunting (1963) but it is far more eerie. The zombies are not as imposing as in Night of the Living Dead, however, they are vastly creepier and macabre.Oozing atmosphere it's a creative and unnerving film that concludes with a common place twist but back in '62 it was ahead of it's time, a true cult classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hour and a half long "Twilight Zone"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the more interesting b-movie horror features from the sixties. It has all the feel of "Night of the Living Dead". There was obviously a low budget, but the black and white film has the stark realism of Romero's classic. I wouldn't say it is a work of genius. "Carnival of Souls" has developed a status, and deservedly so, of a cult film. It is a welcome surprise to discover this film, as so many b- movie horror films enter the realm of "forgettable nonsense". I'm only nitpicking here, but the problem I have with this film is the fact that it takes so long to tell its story. I must confess to being spoiled by watching too many classic "Twilight Zones".In the early sixties, Serling's "Twilight Zone" presented a nifty little story called "The HItch Hiker" starring the beautiful, ill-fated Inger Stevens. Basically, it's the same story as "Carnival of Souls". A woman involved in a fatal car accident does not realize she is dead. She continues running into this mousy hitch hiker during her trip across country, and the man winds up terrifying her. This story is done neatly in a run time of only twenty six minutes. There is an irony in Inger Stevens playing this role, as she wound up a suicide years later. Plus, the lovely Inger is much easier on the eyes than Ms. Hilgoss.But, as I said, I am nit-picking. "Carnival of Souls" is still interesting to look at, and should be recognized as one of the more compelling horror movies of the sixties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carnival of Souls is one great low-budget horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continuing my reviews of horror movies for the month that Halloween falls on, I finally watched this low-budget cult film, Carnival of Souls, on fancast.com as linked from Hulu.com. I must say this is one of the most original horror/suspense films I've yet seen! Producer/director Herk Harvey fills every shot with something that seems a revelation to me the further the story goes as we segue from reality to nightmare and back in an eventual swirl of surrealism that takes ones breath away. Shot in Lawrence, Kansas and Salt Lake City, Utah, it chronicles the attempt of one Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) to escape her past especially after she survives a car-falling-from-a-bridge accident. At her new apartment, her only neighbors are the landlady, Mrs. Thomas (Frances Feist) and fellow tenant John Linden (Sidney Berger) who has the hots for her. Her job as the church organist gets her in trouble when the minister (Art Ellison) notices her practicing music that sounds less than sacred so he makes her quit. And Dr. Samuels (Stan Levitt) doesn't believe her when she tells him of seeing the same man (director Herk Harvey) wherever she goes. I'll stop there and just say they all give good performances especially Ms. Hilligoss who's stunning beauty gives a haunting look each time. The scenes at the abandoned Saltair Amusement Park are some of the most effective scenes in the picture especially when those ghouls appear. The organ music of Gene Moore is really chillingly compelling. And certainly John Clifford deserves recognition for writing the whole thing. So on that note, I highly recommend Carnival of Souls. P.S. The assistant director is one Reza Badiyi who helmed the famous opening credits of "Hawaii Five-O" and "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and I first knew from episodes he did of "Falcon Crest".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a great film by most means of deduction, but when witnessing something that transcends deduction, the idea of great cinema flies out the window and is replaced with pure cinema. And there is a difference... that critical, logical filter is shattered by a quiet, ethereal something... and you are whisked away into another world. Vast segments of Herk Henry's low budget horror film are just that. Its genuine veracity into realms explored so little by so many filmmakers, is not only admirable but inspiring, haunting; A film that sparks your mind with a flurry of a thousand thoughts, that charges your own creative batteries, and yet simultaneously quiets it into a place devoid of time and the necessity to think or process. While watching this I couldn't help but remember a piece of myself I had never recognized. I say this because essentially CoS is a less abstract, feature version of my own film school thesis. Now had anyone ever talked about this film in class? No. Had I ever heard of it before? Sort of... Once, long ago I recall seeing something of it (the beginning?) on TV, and then being brisked away for some reason or another. Could I have been affected that much as to store a very short but still powerful moment with me well into the next decade of my life? Perhaps it came from that collective ether of nightmare and imagination we all drown in from time to time.Drawing inspiration from Ingmar Bergman and Jean Cocteau, and perhaps the macabre short fiction of Ray Bradbury, Henry's film is truly something special even in its uneven acting and sometimes cheap production value, there is an immediate care and devotion to it all. The small dedicated crew who crafted this film loved cinema, and dared to dive into its depths. And rarely is that so apparent in film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film David Lynch never made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carnival of Souls is a very low-budget and nowadays, an almost forgotten horror masterpiece. It's much better than the overrated Night of the Living Dead or The Evil Dead. The film scares the hell out of you, so, if you don't want to be scared, I recommend it to be seen in broad daylight, but still it would be terrifying. This very David Lynch-ish chiller is incredibly unsettling, uneasy, suspenseful and scary. It's nightmarish, otherworldish sequences are way ahead of it's time and very powerful. The idea of the film being in black and white also adds to the horror and gives the film a dark, film-noir feel to it, which is ruined in the digitally colorized version. I felt the acting was pretty good as well, Candace Hillgloss makes a pretty convincing heroine which is either loosing her mind or is really haunted by the mysterious man who wants her to join him and his dead fellows in the Carnival of Souls. The film, surprisingly, isn't slow-paced, there are things going on all the time, and just when you think it will stop, it only gets scarier and scarier, building up to the fantastic ending. Carnival of Souls is indeed a film you can't afford to miss!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's often the case with horror films that the best ones are those that rely on the power of suggestion rather than gallons of fake blood and impersonal computer-generated special effects - think of the work of Val Lewton, for example, which showed a rare intelligence for a much-maligned genre."Carnival of Souls" was shot on a budget with no big-name stars, and yet succeeds in unsettling the viewer to a degree that goes far beyond many of its mega-budget rivals. A young woman, Mary Henry, survives a plunge off a bridge in her friend's car and, seemingly unscathed, travels to a new town to start work as a church organist. There is something cold and unfeeling about her, despite her apparent lack of injuries, and she eventually upsets and unsettles those around her, including the church minister and her creepy fellow lodger, Mr Linden. In turn, Mary feels cut off from the world around her, especially as she experiences episodes where she seems to be ignored by everyone. There is also the strange matter of the zombie-like figure she keeps seeing, and the deserted fairground which somehow draws her to it ...."Carnival of Souls" could be viewed as a horror film purely on the main story (girl pursued by zombies), and is a success on that level: however, the film's power is due to the psychological aspects underlying the plot. Mary experiences a type of disconnection with society, at one point exclaiming "I don't belong in the world", and it is this disorientation which affects the viewer most strongly. She is ignored in a department store: when she tries to get the attention of the shop assistants, she feels as if she is not there - and haven't we felt that way ourselves at times, when no-one appears to acknowledge that we need attention and service. However, the problem goes deeper: Mary also finds that her supposedly sympathetic doctor seems unaware of her when she is discussing her problems - it's like the teenager saying to their parents "You just don't listen!" And what of the fairground? A building which usually brings back happy childhood memories, somewhere to have fun and laughter, and yet this fairground has a sinister fascination for Mary. It simultaneously repels and attracts her, and she discovers the truth when she pays it a final visit. "Carnival of Souls" can be seen as a powerful horror film, but its subconscious level is the device that lifts it into a masterpiece. Mary's crisis that of the adolescent, who feels cut off from the world, unable to make society listen to her, and unable to find any more solace in the things that made childhood so enjoyable (ie the fairground). Ultimately, she has to mature, to seek the company of the opposite sex to provide an adult relationship, to acknowledge the world around her just as she wants it to acknowledge her. Does Mary succeed in doing this - or is this transition from teen to adult literally the death of her?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A handsome accomplishment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Herk Harvey's only feature film, made for around $30K, has the tone of an uneasy, creepy dream. It is not grotesque like "Eraserhead", another dream-like entry, or violent like a "Nightmare on Elm Street", it is simply strange. After a car containing three women plunges off a bridge into a river, the lone survivor, a church organist, flees to a nearby town to begin a new life. En route, her attention is drawn to a strange, distant pavilion which once housed a carnival. Now abandoned, the pavilion takes hold of our heroine and invades her dreams. She keeps seeing a pale man in a suit as she is compelled to visit the pavilion and the restless carnival of souls who lurk there. Nicely shot and executed with uncommon simplicity, this is an effective, subtle horror film that manages to give its audience the same experience as its heroine. The relentless organ score fills the atmosphere with dread and the strange performances enrich the dream-like quality. A handsome accomplishment that may have been an inspiration for aspects of Stephen King's "The Shining" (the pavilion and its ballroom of the dancing dead plays like a precursor to the Overlook Hotel's similar ballroom scene).</fullReview>

So I bought the set, having a bit of change on me, and that night I readied myself for some fun. When I put Carnival of Souls into the player, I was at first a bit unimpressed. I mean, nothing really happened that related to any sort of plot. Then, about 25 minutes into the film I started feeling very uneasy, a feeling I was unfamiliar with in film with the exception of Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining'. the story is simple, to put it short a woman survives a car accident, and delves into a dissolute surrealistic nightmare.The surreal atmosphere, the sudden realizations of fear, and the general feel of the film gave a VERY foreboding atmosphere, which haunted me the entire following week. The film is just so foreboding, I could not help but remain uneasy, even the second time around.The film also was also fairly technically impressive, at least more so then I thought. This film had come six years before George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead, but the use of camera is very similar, and it is very evident that Romero has been influenced by this film's direction. It is a shame that Herk Harvey did not expand on his talent, this is his only feature, yet there is nothing amateur about it. It is very advanced considering what it is, and I was overtly impressed with it.I suppose Carnival of Souls could, and maybe should warrant an 8/10, I gave it 7/10, but it is truly an original film, and one that I feel holds up very well in the present day. I think it is a must see for fans of surrealism, horror, or just experiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the best example of a film that cost next to nothing to make but really delivers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film reminds me a lot of the original VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED. Aside from starring George Sanders, VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED was made on a shoestring budget yet was one of the most effective and scary films of all time. While this movie isn't quite as good, it is exceptional--especially when it has a significantly lower budget than VILLAGE. The film was shot around Lawrence, Kansas (not exactly a film mecca) and featured locals and small-time actors.The film starts with two cars drag racing through the countryside. The one vehicle with three young ladies aboard crashes off the side of a bridge and into the water below. It appears they are all killed but dragging the river is tough since the current is very strong. Then, unexpectedly, after three hours, one of the young ladies climbs out of the water--shaken and dirty but otherwise alright!The next day, the lady leaves town forever to take up the job as a church organist in a city far away. It becomes pretty obvious based on her actions and body language that she is a pretty asocial type person (a "schizoid personality" is the correct psychological term, by the way) AND she also has little, if any, appreciation for the church--to her it's just a job. However, her tough exterior is quite shaken when she begins seeing a scary dead-looking guy during her drive to the new town. This begins as her car passes an old abandoned carnival but she continues periodically seeing this zombie-like guy once she arrives in the new town. Locals suspect she is crazy and after a while the lady isn't so sure of her sanity as well!! What she IS sure of is that somehow this carnival is the key, so in the end she goes there at night for a showdown.There's a lot more to the film than this, but I don't want to spoil any of the suspense--and there is a lot of it!! Despite the low budget, this is a "scare the pants off you" type film that is great to watch alone late at night!!! Additionally, the non-professional actors did a bang-up job--this is a true cult classic and deserves to be well remembered. I really wish most modern film makers would see this film to understand that good writing and direction are the keys to great films--not huge budgets, special effects and prima donna actors!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again someone proves that low budget isn't synonymous with no quality. This movie honestly surprised me. Being unaware of it, well, when I watched it I was caught off guard. The photography is great, the sequences having an eerie, surrealistic feel to them. This thing, while not that hard to figure out, is really put together well. The continuity is good, and it flows well. It leaves certain questions unanswered, and still other things are left to the viewers imagination. Which things normally works well in what ever type of thriller, other things being equal. And this flick is more than just equal. Mary Henry is great as the lead. She engenders sympathy for her character while projecting a "Don't touch me!" sort of air. Given the status of the character these things are very appropriate. This film stands the test of time right well and is fully deserving a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I purchased this movie in a pack of 50 horror films. It was the first one on the list, therefore i watched it first. I fell in love with it from the very beginning. It is a great horror film. Although it wont stand the test of time, it is a great movie and should be spread by word of mouth. Herk Harvey did a fabulous job directing and acting in the film, although i haven't seen any of his other films. The whole movie concept is great and very original for its time. I really didn't see it coming. Even for 1962, it had great suspenseful scenes and great imagery. I also recently bought a shirt from the movie. If you don't have a problem with B horror films then you should definitely watch this one. It is a great horror film and definitely deserves a 10 out of 10 rating.</fullReview>

I first saw this film on a Saturday afternoon TV a number of years ago, never having heard of it. Perhaps that gave the movie more impact than it would have had if I had some familiarity with it, or heard some hypeHowever, when I saw it a second time I was still unsettled by it. It was as if it had been made in a parallel world off-set from our own. The amateurish quality of the film, the washed-out appearance of many scenes, the Gothic organ music, and the detached behavior of the characters all contributed to the bad-dream feel of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy, uneasy viewing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're trying to get a grip on what kind of film the original Carnival of Souls is, it's kind of a traditional 50s/60s horror (like House on Haunted Hill or any of the other William Castle jobbies) spliced with something a lot more edgy, like Night of the Living Dead or a French new wave film. While written in a traditional 50s/60s style, it avoids the trappings of Noir and other movements that were going on at the time, instead taking a more pseudo-documentary take on things, opting for realism over stylisation. This leads to a cold, chilling movie that is incredibly taut and gets right under your skin.The level of realism makes the films hallucination sequences all the more creepy. The film concerns a young woman who survives a horrific car wreck, attempts to continue on with her life as she had intended but discovers something is very wrong, that her world has changed irreparably and she is being stalked by a ghostly figure. This premise lends itself perfectly to a black and white movie, the high visual contrast making the hauntings all the more stark and shocking. The woman's slow loss of her grip on reality, and the shocking conclusion, are gradually unveiled in a way that's now been copied by a thousand movies, but never quite recaptured in the same way.Still, despite being a fantastic 'descent into madness' chiller, Carnival of Souls stumbles at a few hurdles. The movie hasn't been treated well by time, having been largely forgotten by a fairly fickle industry, so finding a half decent copy is going to be hard. The copy I watched (a R2 DVD from a company called Dark Vision) had a pretty decent image, but the movie's stock has aged a lot and certain scenes had become indecipherable. Also some of the dialogue had become very muffled, giving the impression the actors were talking into their shoes.On the subject of dialogue, Carnival is not strong on characterisation. It's a mood piece, and with the exception of the main character, very few of the characters are painted in anything more than broad strokes. If you're looking for a highly emotive movie, Carnival isn't it, all of it's emotion comes from it's visuals.These are minor gripes though. If you track down a decent version of the film (a remastered colourised version is available in the States for instance) and are happy with watching a consciously art-house movie then this comes highly recommended. Carnival's cult classic status is well deserved, and it hands out some of horror's great enduring images during it's runtime. If you're not moved by any of this film, you may want to check your pulse.</fullReview>

This movie is a very creepy movie, not bloody or gory like most of today's horror movies, but genuinely scary without having to show blood and guts. I have always thought abandoned theme parks are creepy anyway, and the fact that a central part of the movie revolves around the Saltair Pavilion, an abandoned theme park set outside of Salt Lake City, Utah just added to the freaky atmosphere of this movie, at least for me. This movie is very low budget, using unknown actors, and it shows, but amazingly, this didn't stop this movie from scaring the be jeez out of me.

And the budget- 13,000$- is the lowest I've seen, and puts Corman films to shame.But what is extraordinary about this film is the constant feeling of dread that it conveys, without the help of a good script or good acting. Somehow, this director managed to make something out of nothing- some of the shots and compositions just feel grim, somehow. And the music, even though a little annoying, was perfect too.A big lesson in little film-making. Clearly, M. Night Shamalyan watched this a few times before making 'the sixth sense'.

		<fullReview>I guess I have had a problem watching black and white horror movies for thepast year or so. I don't know why, maybe it is more of the fact that I just have been into horror films out of the 70s and early 80s. I picked up a DVD horror movie set that contained Carnival of Souls. I thought I had heard some goodreviews, but kept passing it up. Well, i'm glad I didn't put this one off any longer. This was a well made film.I love films like this. The viewer is not sure what is reality and what is the character's loss of sanity. There is a sense of paranoia, but we are also drawn into the character's need for answers. It is ashame there is not more material from this director. Another reviewer mentioned this film being expressionistic. I agree, the camera angles and composition of the shots do bring me back tosome classic expressism in film. I think this movie should be accessible to anyone, that is, you don't have to be a film nerd like me to enjoy it. This may not be Friday the 13th or even The Blob for that matter. But it has a freaky little twist to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** out of ****, Bizarre, Twilight Zone-like supernatural thriller from director Herk Harvey and writer John Clifford, who surprisingly never made another feature-length film after this. During a drag race, the girls' car falls off a bridge and into the water and only one of the girls survives. She is a church organist and takes a job as one in a small town, where she begins to beckoned by a mysterious and ghostly man, and begins to have odd dizzy spells, which all leads her to a mysterious pavilion near the lake... Candace Hilligoss does a refreshingly strange job as Mary Henry, the organist, with her expressive eyes and brows. The photography and direction are excellent, and overall it's a technically well-made film. Some people have said that this film is predictable, but imagine if you were back in 1962 seeing this for the first time. Only problem is with this film is some of the writing, but I do not blame Clifford for he wrote only one good draft of his screenplay before the shooting began.Not rated, but contains intense situations and some violence. 1962</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangely strange....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films like "Carnival of Souls" make me a little sad. Sad that we've gotten too smart and too sophisticated, seen and heard and done too much for anything to scare us anymore. Face it, when was the last time a movie really scared you? Sure, sure, you may have been grossed out, or even shocked by the latest CGI gorefest playing at the Multiplex, but there's nothing really scary anymore. Anyway, Director Herk Harvey's 1962 mini-opus is the kind of film that unwittingly tips its' hand from the very beginning. Fortunately, Harvey and writer John Clifford put so much gusto into what's really just a Twilight Zone plot that you have to follow along. Also credit the slightly off kilter, vaguely erotic presence of Candace Hilligoss in the lead role of Mary Henry. From the moment her character stumbles from a muddy river inlet after a drag-racing accident, she seems to resonate with a feeling of strangeness that defies explanation. Mary seems to drift from scene to scene, not really rooted to her surroundings or the characters she encounters. Though inadvertent, the wooden, overstated acting of the supporting cast reinforces the otherworldly feeling we get from Mary. What's the deal? Wait and see. Really, we don't have to wait and see. I saw the ending of this film practically from the beginning, but it really doesn't matter all that much. Harvey and Clifford aren't really trying to scare us.the feeling they give us is one of creeping, impending dread.Modern movies all want to be rollercoasters.each with a bigger and more heart-stopping thrill. Watching `Carnival of Souls' is more like an uncertain and slightly warped merry go round.You may know where you're going and why, but your palms are still gonna sweat until it's all over. This film is a MUST-SEE for fans of George Romero's "Night of the Living Dead."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Low-Budget Horror Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have reason to believe Carnival of Souls is the greatest low-budget horror flicks like Night of the Living Dead (1968), Halloween (1978), and even Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece Psycho (1960), but none have the power and beauty of this one. The film, as a whole, is incredibly eerie, and surreal, filled with haunting images, and a very spooky atmosphere. The organ score adds greatly, and the terrific performances of Candace Hilligoss, and Sidney Berger are basically Oscar-worthy. But the real honor go to Herk Harvey and John Clifford, who with little money, but a lot of talent, created this great film. It has become a part of me, for it pinched a nerve deep in my spirit that i didn't know was there. Just watch this film, you won't regret it, it is beautiful and perfect, an art-horror film ever made. There have been many fantastic shoestring horror classic. Just as one of the original taglines for the movie - "A story so haunting, it will burn itself into your mind". And that is the truth.Don't forget to help get the film in the top 250.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic, low-budget horror flick from the 1960s does indeed feel like an extended episode of "The Twilight Zone." But that's not a bad thing, because TZ rocks. The plot may be considered unoriginal today (in the same way that time and numerous imitations have caused "Psycho" to completely lose its power to shock), but there is nevertheless a good deal to admire here. Interesting visuals and camera angles, at least one truly inventive transition (watch for our heroine getting directions from a gas station attendant), and creepy organ music score are some highlights. Possibly influenced by German Expressionism, although Laughton's "The Night of the Hunter" remains the definitive Expressionist film (and one I highly recommend). What I wonder is if "Carnival"'s director Herk Harvey hadn't read nearly forgotten weird fiction author Robert W. Chambers. It seems unlikely that he would (or even could) have, but I note some interesting parallels between this film and Chambers's story, "In the Court of the Dragon," e.g., "blasphemous" organ music in church, mysterious pursuit by an otherworldly man, etc. Check it out sometime -- the story is available in its entirety on the web. Oh yeah, and give "Carnival" a watch too. It's not crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carnival of Souls (from 1962, not the unrelated 1998 movie with the same name) is an (admittedly obscure) art-house classic. Shot in high-contrast black-and-white, on a miniscule budget, it has an eerie, dreamlike quality throughout perhaps reminiscent of Roman Polanski's "Repulsion".Although the lead Candace Hilligoss had acted before, many of the supporting players were not professionals and some of the locations were worked into the film simply because they were available (for example the deserted funfair, apparently located in Salt Lake City). The director Herk Harvey, who had worked on educational shorts before directing this feature, makes a cameo appearance as one of the "dancing dead" at the funfair towards the end of the movie.One of a kind, and recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Like a Great Twilight Zone Episode at Feature Length!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't wait to watch this movie when I rented it. The video I got had a few critics reviews raving this movie, and one saying that this was like a lost Twilight Zone Episode. And it is!Candice Hilligoss plays such a vulnerable character as Mary, a woman just in a car accident. She emerges from the river hours later, with no explanation. She then moves into a renting house when she accepts a new job as an organist at a church. The idea of the house only having one other guest, and a maid seemed quite frightening, and a real setup for something.Soon Mary starts seeing this phantom-like man, who, in productions for the movie, was really only a man with pasty white face paint and black rings painted around his eyes. But wasn't that scary?! I mean, no special effects at all. Just a plain-old zombie. And very scary. These sightings get worse and worse, and then there are moments that are like a dream sequence, with Mary going through the town as if a spirit. No one sees her; no one hears her, and she can't hear them. And then it ends. She starts seeing a doctor about these things, while also getting involved with the other guest at the house she is at, yet he is suspicious of her weird ways, and closed-off feelings towards him. Plus, she can't stop thinking about the old carnival she saw a few times while driving by, and she even explores it once.After many days of this, it starts to get worse and worse, and she finally decides to leave. There is a minute or two of the scariest scenes in the movie that should have and quite literally could have been real, but it is only a dream. Though, the ending is great, with a terrifying chase in the carnival of souls, with many of these people after her. It's so scary!I definitely recommend this movie for people who loved "The Blair Witch Project." It's that horror that doesn't pop up at you, but is so real, and leaves you feeling so empathetic, and futile because of that. There is no blood, no sex, no profanity, no violence. Nothing. Just horror. Definitely see this movie.</fullReview>

IMDb give tantalizingly little about her pre-C of S days; she surfaces in '62 and makes another horror flick two years later. Then...what? Did she forsake acting? Is she still alive?

		<fullReview>If anyone ever asks me why Batman and Robin is my pick for the all-time worst film, I tell them about this movie. On a $30,000 budget, they took a tightly written and wonderfully eerie script and turned it into an absolutely classic horror film, as close to a nightmare as anything I have ever seen. Movies like this give hope to all those film students out there who think they can't produce a memorable film for less than $10 million (and these days even that would be considered extremely low budget!).What strikes me most about this movie are its "special effects." It has what I consider to be one of the most compelling effects ever used in a movie: silence. Those scenes when the sound goes out are just brilliantly filmed, and producing that effect probably actually SAVED them money.Also, the camera work in this one is excellent. The angles are original and the cuts are effective. It all just goes to show exactly how far you can get with $30,000. What a fabulous movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the finest B-movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mary (Candace Hilligoss) is in the passenger seat of a car with her two friends when they are challenged to a drag race by some boys. The driver accepts, and the car ends up crashing over the end of a bridge, landing into the water. Several hours later, while the police investigate and onlookers gather, Mary emerges from the water apparently unscathed. She carries on with her life, and goes ahead with taking her new job as a church organ player in a nearby town. Things become strange as she keeps seeing the ghostly figure of a strange man, and Mary finds herself repeatedly drawn to an abandoned carnivale.What is ultimately a micro-budgeted B-movie, Carnival of Souls has gained popularity as the years have gone by and is now considered a cult classic. With a budget estimated at around $33, 000, director Herk Harvey achieved stunning things with so little. The limited resources are visible on screen though, as the sets, cinematography and supporting actors do little to flatter the movie. But Carnival of Souls manages to overcome these relatively irrelevant limitations with a fine performance from Hilligoss, and plenty of atmosphere to boot. It's clear to see this must have been a big influence on the likes of George A. Romero and David Lynch.The film also takes some brave stylistic and artistic risks. Mary finds herself staying in a small hotel with the strange and lecherous John (Sidney Berger). While at first he seems to be your typical idiotic B- movie supporting character, he soon becomes something far more sinister. In a rare scene where we leave Mary, we see John talking to one of his loser friends in a drunken frenzy, talking about how he'll soon have her. There's a real feeling that John is bordering on raping Mary, and remember, this is a 1962 American film., when things were unheard of. Also, Mary's emotionless responses to his advances may be touching on lesbianism. It may just be because of what is revealed at the end, but it seemed to me to certainly touch on this possibility.It really hits its stride in the dream-like carnivale sequences. While the final few scenes are predictable and can be guessed in the first ten minutes or so, it's the execution that is so alarming and exceptional. The dead arise from the water, ghostly white and emotionless. They dance their waltz of the dead amongst the brightly lit fairground in several strange, soundless, and sped-up sequences that evokes the expressionist silent horror films of the 20's. It is truly beautiful, and has influenced a thousand lesser horror films. Truly one of the finest B- movies ever made, and a great example of how so much can be done with so little.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

If this 1962 film had been made in France, people would have described it then as a Nouvelle Vague flick along with Truffaut or Godard but because it was made in the US, which is obsessed with a film's glitzy and materialistic aspects and not with art CARNIVAL OF SOULS was/has been relegated to b-movie oblivion. Make no mistake about it, even with its limited budget and mostly non-professional actors, this horror film is a masterpiece through and through. It's totally unique. It's an amazing haunting time capsule that big budget Hollywood films could never even come close to capturing/recreating. The on-location filming is beautifully captured with the unglamorous cinematography that gives soul to the spooky goings on. It's brilliant from beginning to end. A ghostly experience in more ways than one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most important American film to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the most important American-made film since "Citizen Kane". However I believe that the philosophic themes in "Carnival of Souls" make this film the more important of the two. Both Welles and Harvey utilized European techniques and styles and did use some experimentalism. Both films deal with death. "Kane" starts with death and reviews a man's life. "Carnival of Souls" starts with death but instead of reviewing the main characters life shows us the psychological struggle during and following the moment of death. Though we do not see Mary Henry's character revealed through her past experiences(like Kane)-we do see her character revealed through the way she deals with her new situation and journey of discovery. This is more difficult to do I believe. While Kane may seem slickly scripted-and the dialog is- a script is also a story and here is where "Carnival of Souls" truly breaks new ground. There have been screenplays dealing with the afterlife and the discovery of that fact by the story's characters prior to "Carnival of Souls". However no other movie had ever presented the the main character as invisible to the world-someone who cannot be seen or heard. The main character is brought out of this state by the sound of nature- a bird singing. This story idea was most recently employed (and employed well) in the film "The Sixth Sense". Although the use of the walking dead was not new in 1960( considering all the prior zombie films) this is the first time the walking dead idea has been used in a purely ghostly- haunting fashion. The zombies are imagined (or are they) in this film. They are more symbolic characters than horror types. Lastly this film deals with the subject of human alienation which is rarely dealt with in film. This film takes the alienation perspective to such an degree that is is impossible to think of a film that has ever created the mood, rationale, psychological atmosphere, and physical experiences of human alienation. I have seen interviews with the writer of "Carnival of Souls"-John Clifford. He states in his interviews that people are constantly asking how he came up with the ideas presented in this movie. He says he can't remember how he came up with these ideas.I first saw this movie in 1969/1970 on late night TV. The scenes where Mary Henry goes into the changing booth at a department store and then hears the dinging bell of store operations and is then changed and enters another world is a cinematic moment that I was never able to forget. Although I did forget the name of the movie, twenty years later the film was released on video and I remember looking at the video box and thinking that this might be that movie where the woman walks out of the water after a car accident(it is the picture on the cover of the box). I began watching and could see this was the movie I had seen 20 years ago. I watched the entire movie and then began to study it. All aspects of this film are superb-all the actors, the camera operator, the musician, the lighting engineer, the sound engineers(the overdub is perfect for that section of the film-perhaps an accident),sound editors, film editors, the director and producer( Harvey was an industrial filmmaker of merit) and without question the screenwriter (John Clifford). The fact that the style and theme of the film was out of synch for times (early 1960's) only adds to it's worth. The idea was given to Harvey to make this film by the location itself (according to him) and he did his job well in arranging and choosing the proper writer and talents to carry out the project. The feel and mood and atmosphere are rarely seen in films today. The groundbreaking ideas of the film(devoid of socio-political comment) brings the main theme to an incredibly basic level which all persons can appreciate.</fullReview>

Images have stuck with me - the floating fingers on the organ, Mr. Linden the creepy neighbor in the boarding house, the ghostly amusement park, and all of the bizarre characters this young woman comes in contact with during her journey of discovery.The lead actress seemed like an amateur, which made her all the more realistic in the long run. What happened to Mr. Harvey? Anyone who has viewed this one is not likely to forget it. The music, cinematography, and sound were right on the money. A bizarre journey for anyone who can find it.

		<fullReview>Slow-moving and atmospheric, "Carnival of Souls" is one of those fantastic films that transcends its low budget and manages to be something you're likely to remember for a long time.A young woman is with two friends in a car that accidentally goes over a bridge and plunges into the river below. Hours later, as rescue workers are dragging the river for the car, our heroine appears on a mud bank, dazed but otherwise unharmed. Her accident inspires her to relocate and find a new life in a neighboring community, but she is followed by a grinning, ghostly presence that intensifies after she glimpses a weird abandoned carnival just on the outskirts of town. Why is she drawn to the old park, and why does she feel as if she doesn't belong in the world? The action is minimal, and it's not the most fast-paced film you'll ever see, but the overall effect is remarkable. Part of this is due to the very creepy abandoned amusement park that serves as one of the sets in the film, which has a spooky feel the moment it appears on screen. Later, when dark-eyed ghouls begin to prowl the location, it becomes even more menacing. Gaps in the narrative only heighten the film's strangeness. Fans of more intense horror films will probably be disappointed with the film's slow pace and gradually building atmosphere, not to mention its lack of a body count.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I'll go ahead and liken Carnival of Souls to a really long episode of the Twilight Zone with significantly better formal qualities. This film has some pretty slick cinematography going on, especially considering that it was made in 1962 with a very low budget. The musical score (primarily organ music) provides an eerie atmosphere that successfully makes it all the way to the end. And that old dude, well, there's no denying that he's creepy. And that moving shot of the abandoned carnival grounds... well that's an image that is staying with me well after I've seen the movie. So there's definitely a lot to recommend this film if you're a fan of scary movies. Don't expect a whole lot from the plot though. It doesn't really make a whole lot of sense, and it doesn't seem to concerned with providing any answers at the end. You can predict the end probably within the first twenty minutes if you think about it a little bit. The main character's motivations are severely underdeveloped and it will get on your nerves by the end. And the pacing is sloooowwwwwww. In conclusion, I think Carnival of Souls would have worked better if it were much shorter (maybe about the length of a Twilight Zone episode.) But I recommend it to any fan of the genre. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*****SPOILERS*****Being the only survivor from a car that crashed and fell off a bridge during a drag race Mary, Candace Hilligoss,is haunted by living while her two friends in the car with her drowned. Trying to put the accident behind her and out of her mind Mary, a church organist, takes a long and tiring drive down to Utah for a job at a church there to start a new life. Strange things begin to happen to Mary as she drives down south Mary passes an old deserted carnival when all of a sudden she starts to see a the sight of a ghoulish looking man in her car windshield that causes here to drive off the highway in order to avoid hitting him. At first thinking it's the stress and fatigue from what she went through from the accident or the long tiring car ride Mary soon forgets about that strange and eerie incident. Settling down as an organist at the local church Mary seems to be oddly attracted to that old carnival that she passed along the way as if it were a magnet pulling her into it. At the rooming house where Mary is staying she again sees that same ghoulish man that she saw on the&nbsp;highway hanging out in the hallway but nobody else there sees him. Mary's next door neighbor John, Sidney Berger, who at first she tried to avoid now she starts to become friendly with him. Mary's attention toward John is to keep her from isolating herself from the world like she been doing. Having someone to talk to would put out of Mar's mind that strange feeling as well as the strange illusions that she's been having of late. But the more Mary tries to break out of her isolation the more isolated she becomes from the real world.Mary starts to get this strange and eerie feeling that somehow she doesn't exist, in the world of the living, and starts to lose her mind and loses&nbsp;her job as a church organist. Mary also seems to have no control at all of her actions when it comes to playing the church organ. Her relations with John also begins to falls apart when John senses that Mary is becoming very unstable. Even when he's very drunk John sees that she's, like he tells her, "off her rocker" when she mistakenly thinks that he's the ghoulish man that's been following her since she survived that car accident. Quickly Mary's grip on reality starts to disintegrate when she becomes almost a ghost to everyone that she comes in contact with. The only persons that seem to see and notice Mary at all are ghoulish looking people like the man that's been haunting her throughout the movie. Mary begins to slowly realizes that the answer to what's been happening to her somehow lies in that deserted carnival outside the town. Irresistibly as if by some unknown force she's driven there and it's in that haunted and spooky place where Mary finds out just what that answer is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film haunted me from childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Carnival of Souls" in the 1960s on TV in Sydney. The film was presented on TV by a character called "Deadly Earnest." This film haunted me as a child and I had never forgotten the film or the creepy way it had scared me. I was lucky to pick up a VHS video copy for $5.00 in a bargain bin at the Woolworths Metro store in George St , Sydney, about 5 years ago. Although "Carnival of Souls" is a low budget film, I found the amateur actors added realism to the film. I thought the story and twist at the end was excellent. Did this film inspire "Sixth Sense" with Bruce Willis ?This is a classic cult horror film and should not be underrated.</fullReview>

The setting was perfect, pace was superb, music was excellent, and the performance by Candice Hilligloss (Unfortunately her only one too) was chilling and brilliant. It hasn't dated one bit, either.I saw this film on sale at an antique store, thought it looked interesting and it was only $4, too. I read in Halliwells film guide that it got zero stars. That sort of put me off it, but I kept watching it anyway. It had bad sound and picture quality but I kept watching, and then it struck me how original and creepy it was. I guess I'm never gonna need Halliwell's again!It's about a woman who mysteriously survives a drag race accident, when her and her friends car falls off a bridge into the lake below. From then on it's a compelling, bizarre and relentlessly eerie story with some of the scariest moments ever put on film. And if you thought The Sixth Sense was original, then see this for yourself. It is basically a remake of this classic little-known chiller. Rush down to your video store now.PLOT: 9 DIRECTION: 9 ACTING: 9 SCRIPT: 9 MUSIC: 9OVERALL: 9</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the ultimate exemplification of the virtue of low budgets and "amateurishness". So as you can't write a good symphony for a thousand instruments, big budgets and art are antithetical. This is not only a very good horror movie, the best I've seen (though I'm not necessarily a fan of the genre), it is a very beautiful movie. I can't believe the writer, the composer, the director never worked again. The actress' shuffling lassitude is just wonderful. The first time I saw it, especially the ending, I shivered. The effect has worn off, of course, but the whole visual, aural thrill lingers. This film's humility is appealing. It doesn't try too hard. Without revealing too much about the plot, this film seems to be saying that ghosts are ubiquitous, and that there is no escaping them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sole survivor of a car wreck (I'd love to write a story called "Soul Survivor"), a young woman later experiences a series of disturbing visions. In spite of a shoestring budget, amateurish performances, and a simplistic concept, this non-gory Horror flick scores big on atmosphere and has some original and intriguing bits of camera-work. I wouldn't pass up the chance to watch it.Debits and demerits of this very-LOW-budget film: The sound quality is groaningly bad (her dubbed footsteps sound like wooden clogs). Lots of good shocks from simple appearances of zombie-like people at unexpected moments. But unfortunately, in the end their supposedly-sinister-looking pursuit of the girl just looks stupid -- like a child's game of "Tag, You're It." The soundtrack of church-organ music doesn't quite work either. But it was laudably DIFFERENT, which also sums up the basic reason for recommending the flick. While the results were uneven, they tried -- and in the process often came through. The camerawork was particularly fresh. Example: At one point a man points down the road to give directions to a boardinghouse. The hand-held camera pans away in the same direction... pans wildly into the darkness of the night. The following edit is seamless, showing an unlit interior then the door opens as the landlady shows the girl her room. Nice to remember that it doesn't take beaucoup bucks to include the little extra touches.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid horror film doubling as a psychiatric character study, but not without its drawbacks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A solidly entertaining and, at times, pretty creepy supernatural horror film which doubles as a psychiatric character study. After surviving a car wreck, Mary, an aloof organist, is haunted by repeated visions of a man who seems to be pursuing her. She becomes increasingly distressed, and eventually seeks answers in a nearby abandoned carnival which she feels strangely drawn to.For an older horror film, Carnival of Souls really does have some surprisingly effective and unsettling moments and has a lot of things going for it. It has a nice, creepy organ score, simple yet effective ghoul makeup, memorable locations like the abandoned carnival, and most off all, a warped and dream-like atmosphere. The best and most memorable sequences in the film really draw you in to Mary's troubled mind and make you feel like you're living in her confused version of reality.Mary reminds me quite a bit of the schizophrenic protagonist in Roman Polanski's Repulsion as well as a bit of Scarlett Johansson in Under the Skin. She's attractive and seems put-together, but has an icy, distant quality and doesn't relate well to others. Although by the end of the film it becomes clear that the story is supernatural in nature, part of what I really liked about it is that much of the film also works as a portrayal of a first-break psychosis. Mary's character fits some criteria for schizoid personality disorder in that she is pathologically unable to connect with others, and furthermore lacks any interest in forming relationships. Individuals with schizoid personality disorder can have brief psychotic episodes, which are essentially defined by losing touch with reality and frequently involve hallucinations. Psychotic episodes are also commonly brought on by extreme stress, so given her recent near-death experience the pieces really do fit together nicely to explain her symptoms from a psychiatric standpoint.In addition to the positives, there were definitely some things that brought this film down for me, the most distracting of which was probably the acting. Some of the dialogue scenes in this movie just feel so incredibly wooden. There are many instances when the characters feel like they are simply reciting their lines rather than actually having a conversation with one another. I guess you could kind of forgive Mary seeing as her character is meant to be aloof and awkward, but really no one in the film was any better and it often broke the immersion. And speaking of immersion-breaking, wow they really didn't even attempt to make it appear like Mary was actually playing the organ. Her hands don't come even remotely close to matching the music that she is supposedly playing and it's pretty distracting. Maybe it's just me though - it's a pretty big pet peeve.Part of me feels like this movie would have been even better if it was a silent film that was completely backed by the great organ music. They honestly wouldn't have to change much of the story at all. The best scenes in the movie are already long, hallucinatory, organ-backed, dialogue-lacking sequences. If it had just cut down completely on the immersion-breaking dialogue and went fully avant-garde with it, the movie could've really, really shined. Regardless, Carnival of Souls was definitely a solid and creepy horror film and it's worth the watch for sure, just be ready to cringe a few times between the best parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No budget but a huge atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classic little chiller has nothing in the way of special effects yet loads in the way of atmosphere. A simple, yet effective plot makes way for plenty of bizarre and spooky moments as our young, pretty heroine finds herself terrorised by images of a dead man who follows her around. Seen today, there's no denying this film's power and ability to frighten through some very clever techniques.In some ways it feels like a silent film, and simple camera tricks are used to give a haunting, unearthly feel to it (in one sequence dancers are sped up while they dance, giving a very unusual and unique result). This isn't a very complex film and, to be fair, not a lot really happens, but the well-documented twist in the tale is indeed a classic one and not easy to spot coming.The acting is all a little on the amateurish side, to be sure, and (especially with the minor cast members) you get the impression that they're just doing their job, reading their lines, as they emphasise each sentence. But in a weird way this makes the film even stranger, and when you add in the tilted camera angles you realise just how unique this film is. Candace Hilligoss, playing the lead role, has a lot to do here and it's a great role for any actress as she conveys horror, disturbance, extreme fear, and plenty of other emotions. While pretty, there's also a kind of subtle emphasis of her cheekbones in her face, giving her just the right look.Like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD after it, this is a key, influential independent horror film of the '60s, proving once and for all that story is everything and simple filming methods are often the most impressive ones. Worth tracking down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hell is Yourself Too"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Herk Harvey and John Clifford, the following quote by Robert Crumb came to mind while I was watching your film: "Hell is yourself too." I watched your interview on the criterion DVD and both of you seemed like regular nice guys. Not the sort of misanthropes who would have written and directed this film. But then, you could have been wearing a veil of normalcy.I have lived alone in Bombay and I have always felt like Mary Henry when I am on a day out with co workers. Everyone would be excited and I would be wondering whats the big deal. It is evident from the detached expression on Mary Henry's (Candice Hilligoss) face during the exciting drag racing scene at the beginning of the movie, that she is an isolated and misanthropic person. It was a great way to start the movie. You had me interested right there.John, Mary Henry's characterization was great. She is a woman on the brink, unable to fit into regular society. She wants to turn her back to it because she is neither a hipster nor a square. She cannot connect with the partying working class guy or the conservative religious crowd that seems to populate the small town. Was this some sort of commentary on American society of the 60s? I think so.It is to your credit that you did not make this a pean for individuality. So Mary is also not entirely happy with her solitude. She does make attempts to form human relationships by going out to a club and trying to dress well. The scene at the boutique was very well done. I completely identified with it. I have often felt like that. That people are not not paying attention to me. Who hasn't? Good job there, guys.Once again, great characterization. Candace Hilligoss does a good job as the isolated lady. She even has the whole lesbian vibe :) The Saltair amusement park looked forbidding. You guys did a great job filming it. I almost felt like it was this other worldly place faraway from civilization. What an ingenious choice of location. The likes of Eli Roth can learn a thing or two from you guys.The interesting and strange locations - like the initial organ playing sequence in a factory like place and then the car wash, intensified Mary Henry's sense of weirdness.Cant beat you guys for creating atmosphere. The film was awash with this aura of Christianity thanks to the visuals and the great background score by Gene Moore.And before I forget, the title sequence was great. I am surprised more people have not ripped this off. And I am surprised you guys did not make more feature films. What happened? Best Regards, Pimpin.(9/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mary Henry: "It's funny... the world is so different in the daylight. In the dark, your fantasies get so out of hand. But in the daylight everything falls back into place again".The story in Carnival of Souls is about a young woman who survives an auto accident, she moves West to take a church organist's position. But her haunting visions draw her irretrievably to an abandoned fairgrounds.Never before have I watched a movie that made me feel so uncomfortable and spooked out like Carnival of Souls. This 60's spook fest as a cult following behind it, since it wasn't owned by any big name studios and yes this wasn't owned by any studio, so when the movie began it didn't have any big movie studio logos all over it, it just starts. I find it quite unique that a movie with a low budget like this could make a fantastic horror movie with one of the most chilling atmosphere I've ever seen.Carnival of Souls feels like a Twilight Zone episode and I'm saying that in a good way, because if this was actually a Twilight Zone episode it might be the most terrifying episode of all time. I think it's taking inspiration from some of the old episodes and it's good to take inspiration from something if you can pull it off.I don't want to give away too much about the movie as I want you to watch it just like I did by knowing nothing. It really helps the movie experience.Overall Carnival of Souls is a movie worth checking out on Halloween. The directing was great, the musics creepy, the atmosphere is unsettling and the cinematography is haunting but beautiful at the same time. This is one of the most overlooked psychology film ever made and it's absolutely worth checking.</fullReview>

But that experience must have been a serious emotional shock" a doctor tells our anti-heroine, in response to her story of a pale faced man who has seemingly been following her for days. Here Harvey's zero-budget thriller is beautifully filmed in black and white, on location, and has almost a cinema verite feel to it. A lot of the footage is silent, with dialogue and music dubbed in after the fact, which only adds to its disorienting feel. Occasionally intentionally dissonant organ music, sounding like it is being performed by the devil in a Gothic cathedral, haunting, calling, always gets to me as well. So does the bizarre girl playing said organ music. She bitterly says that she never wants a man (yet later begs her male housemate not to leave her) she is inexcusably rude whenever someone tries to help her; she appears cold and aloof almost from the start, and only gets progressively worse and more antisocial as the plot progresses. Her character not only generated absolutely no sympathy, but actually discouraged it, and seemed to want all characters and the audience to dislike her. Director/ producer (and uncredited writer) Herk Harvey, and actress Candice Hilligoss did very well creating her character, making her unique and memorable, and managing to maintain the audience's interest in such an unlikeable character.The film has zero effects work, but manages to use that to its advantage, using its lead girl, organ music, lighting, and on-location photography (in a couple of bizarre locations) to create an eerie feeling of dread and fear, laced with paranoia.</fullReview>

All that is needed is a good story/script, decent actors, good location, great cinematography and a strong director.Mary Henry is in an accident with her friends - she survived drowning but her friends died. She takes a job as a church organist in another town where there is an old pavilion which used to house a carnival - long gone now but the run-down pavilion remains. Mary finds herself haunted by a soul from the carnival. There is a surprise ending to this film for first time viewers.I found Gothic overtones (or undertones) to this film... maybe the lost souls - the old carnival giving that feeling.If you like movies surrounding ghosts/souls, zombies, carnivals, strange films, and older horror-thrillers then you might enjoy this particular film.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One-time director Herk Harvey made this familiar but eerie horror film that stars Candace Hilligoss as Mary Henry, who appears to be the sole survivor from a car that plunged off a bridge into a murky river. Her two friends are dead, but Mary, who is a church organist, has visions of a pale-faced phantom stalking her, even when she moves to another state to take a new church organist position. She doesn't fit in there too well, with her nosy landlady and seedy neighbor all vying for her attention. She is gradually more disconnected from people, as the phantom becomes more visible, though no one else can see him, and he keeps luring her to a deserted carnival pavilion, where her fate will be decided... Quite similar to "The Twilight Zone" episodes 'The Hitch-Hiker' &amp; 'The After-Hours', this film makes up for its obvious plot by being genuinely unsettling, with its own distinct aura. Characters are mostly flat, but considering the true state of the heroine, this is appropriate... A flop at the time, this is now a cult classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eerie. Just...really eerie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Carnival of Souls' is a film that at first glance appears a forgettable, amateurish B-movie and which you could easily be forgiven for passing over if you are switching between channels late at night. However, those that linger just long enough are soon pulled into the films eerie off-kilter world where familiar things are draped in a disconcerting aspect which is hard to pin-point and all the more disconcerting for it.The strangeness begins when Mary (Candace Hilligoss), a young church organist, survives a car accident. After this she experiences a series of unsettling events as she is haunted by visions of a ghoulish stranger (played by Hervey himself), visions of groups of similar ghouls emerging from the sea, experiences periods where everyday sounds become muted, as well as periods where she seems to be invisible to other people. And what's more, she seems consistently drawn to an abandoned pavilion which suggests an answer to her suffering and where the spookiness reaches its ultimate climax. Actually, while the climax of the film is a dead giveaway from the outset, the atmosphere of the film is what 'Carnival of Souls' is all about. This is thanks, in no small part, to the unearthly, distanced look of Hilligoss herself, the spooky organ score, and the locations (such as the abandoned pavilion itself as well as a ballroom which hosts a particularly ghoulish gathering) which made a virtue out of necessity in being those most readily available to match the small, independent budget. All these elements work together and the viewer effortlessly slips into Mary's strange world and also becomes enveloped in the creeping emptiness that consumes her.Despite the "classic" tag afforded the film in recent years, the movie is a B-movie through and through in that it would be a great supporting feature but definitely doesn't really have enough substance to support the expectation of a main feature. Still, it's perfectly suited to insomniac viewing past the witching hour where it will happily haunt the imaginations of those that stumble across it.************************Public domain movie.

		<shortDescription>Undiluted creepiness from the beginning of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a brief period of time, now so long ago, which managed to feel like "a long time ago" just a couple of years after it was over.Some today call it "the Mad Men era," that period just before the cultural meltdown of the late-'60s occurred and the world was never quite the same again.It's that cozy JFK/TwilightZone/PSYCHO/ColdWar era end-of-the-world thing that seemed to crystallize somewhere near the close of the 1950s and ran through the first half of the '60s.The early-'60s was the closest the world ever came to nuclear obliteration (several times, as we've learned over the years). And that bottomlessly hopeless axe hanging over the world's head created a strange and unparalleled haunted mood which (despite the optimistic rise of the American middle class in the '50s) hovered paranoically over everything.And that mood also affected cinema. Any attempt to do "spooky" worked almost effortlessly, regardless of whether it was a high-class Hitchcock production (like PSYCHO or THE BIRDS) or a silly William Castle flick (like 13 GHOSTS or STRAIT-JACKET). Or, for TV, whether it was a profound morality play from Rod Serling (in the aptly-named "Twlight Zone") or something comedic like Opie losing his baseball in that haunted murder mansion on the edge of Mayberry. It just worked. It's was like ground zero for All Things Creepy, the early-'60s.It's when we all almost died. And, movie-wise, a shoestring budget could just makes it all more effective, as CARNIVAL OF SOULS proves. (Or, if you've ever seen it, carnival-set THE INCREDIBLY STRANGE CREATURES WHO STOPPED LIVING AND BECAME MIXED UP ZOMBIES, which manages to be both utterly stupid and utterly hypnotic).Today, these film projects are about half a century into the past. But one might not realize that they quite literally felt that old merely five or six years after that era had ended. Seriously, by even 1969 or 1970, these early-'60s productions already seemed archaic (although in a good way, and still quite watchable) as if they'd come from the beginning of time. (The calendar just eventually caught up with that).CARNIVAL OF SOULS is just one of the better down-market examples of all this: endlessly compelling, bottomlessly eerie, the uber-low budget and cartoonish flavor not damaging the spooky impact of the film whatsoever.Just before the world changed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So yeah, this is one of those not-quite-famous but namedropped-by- mediocre-directors cult films that maybe you haven't seen, but if you've seen it you're SUPPOSED to like it if you're into B movies. Truth is, for being made on a budget of pocket change, it is more ahead of its time than it has any right to be. Keep in mind this was made in the early 60s, and it has, if my memory serves me:* prototypical "jump" scares, more specifically the pseudo-subliminal kind that The Exorcist would later use where a disturbing image is quickly cut in without any sort of obvious reaction cue. There's even one of those mirror scares every other horror movie has these days.* a pretty honest &amp; objective portrayal of a female protagonist, despite a few token 60s "screaming hysterics" bits.* zombies. Sort of.* sexual tension, but no love story. The protagonist is an introverted, socially dysfunctional person, and the awkward guy pursuing her ends up getting angry and lashing out at her. He's somewhere on the creepy and possessive side, but basically decent--it's not really black &amp; white.Above all, it's just so quiet and psychological for a horror movie around this time (which makes it Criterion-bait, yes, but it never quite jumps into soggy cracker "art movie" territory). What really makes those empty ghost carnival scenes feel so genuinely isolated and lonely is how much time the film spends ruminating on the protagonist's disintegrating social and work life. Which is a pretty obvious parallel to... well, you'll figure out the plot twist about half an hour, maybe two minutes into the movie, that's the big problem. It is basically an 80 minute Twilight Zone episode, but the mood it creates often goes beyond those pulpy trappings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Ain't Ringling Bros.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No need to recap the plot.The old joke was that this is the best movie to ever come out of Lawrence, KS. It could be that this is one of the creepiest movies to come from anywhere, Hollywood included. Too bad director-producer Harvey made no more features. His shot selection, plus expert editing, strike me as nearly flawless. Note how effectively he uses ordinary things-- a car lift, a conveyor belt?to put a distance between Mary (Hilligoss) and the world. The shots manage to keep us slightly off-balance the whole way, so that we share Mary's off-balance little world. I don't recall an effect quite like it. Harvey appears to have brought an original and artful imagination to the project.The other big plus is actress Hilligoss. She's perfect for an unusual role? pretty, but in a distinctive way, with a large upturned nose and generous mouth. But it's her many expressive reactions to a shaky world that are riveting. In my book, her performance is at least the equal of many better-known Oscar winners. Also, it's different seeing the many ordinary people, instead of Hollywood extras, that fill out the frame in colorful fashion. (Frankly, though, I would have opted for the ghoul world just to get away from that obnoxious neighbor {Berger}.) Something should also be said of a screenplay (Clifford) that manages to stay on track without once becoming cheesy, always a hazard for horror films. Still, I can't help thinking he and Harvey at some point saw the Twilight Zone episode entitled The Hitch-Hiker (1960). The resemblance is noticeable.Nonetheless, it's hard to believe guys who'd only made industrial type films could come up with a real chiller like this. Just goes to show how much talent there is out there apart from the commercial glitz of Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Few Rough Spots but Very Effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carnival of Souls (1962) *** (out of 4) Cult classic about a woman (Candace Hilligoss) who survives a car crash and soon afterwards she begins to see a strange man as well as being attracted to a strange carnival out in the middle of nowhere. CARNIVAL OF SOULS has always been a love-hate movie to me because each time I watch it I really feel something different. During some viewings I get caught up in the mood and atmosphere of the film and really love. During other viewings I simple grow tired of the slow pacing. I really can't remember a film that had me switching back and forth so much in regards to my feelings on it. With that said, I think it's rather amazing that the film turned out the way it did. Having gone through some of director Herk Harvey's other films, I think it's a minor miracle that the film turned out this way. I think the strongest thing working for the film is the low-budget because this helps build up an atmosphere that is really thick and at times it almost feels as if it's smothering you. This is especially true during the first night sequence where Mary comes across the strange man. This scene is quite hypnotic and there's no question that it contains a surreal feel. I think the lack of any known actors also really helped because you can't connect the people to anything else except for the story going on here. The performances by some of the minor players are certainly on the rough side of things but for the most part I thought Hilligoss did a fine job. The film also contains some extremely good cinematography as well as a rather creepy and mood setting score. CARNIVAL OF SOULS is certainly rough around a few of its edges but at the same time it's pretty remarkable what the crew was able to pull off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An organist capable of stirring the soul...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit while I admire Roger Corman's creativity other than "Bucket of Blood" and a few others, the schlock value is far more extreme, this little film made on a tight budget is really a pleasant surprise, and keeps the audience watching. Good suspense and horror without typical gore.Candace Hilligoss portrays Mary, a church organist in Salt Lake City who acquires a new job in a church and is intrigued by an old abandoned carnival pavilion. The minister takes her past it on way to a call, and she asks him to take her inside. As it is a condemned building he refuses. She stays at a rooming house where odd circumstances begin to occur, a man down the hall ("John Linden") flirts with her, but is turned off by her apparent paranoia. She thinks a corpse-like man is following/pursuing her. Candace Hilligoss was a professionally trained stage actress who toured with Nina Foch and was also a Copacabana girl in New York at one time. She does fit the role, and seems other-worldly and affected.Over time reality begins to unravel and it makes for a good story. Supposedly the recent film "The Machinist" with Christian Bale and Michael Ironside was loosely based on this horror story, and so it is well worth checking out.As the minister notes in the beginning, "you cannot live in isolation from the human race", but you certainly can try as Mary does in this film. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing noir ? fantastic representation of PTSD.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was billed as horror film and it would be unfortunate if that deters some viewers. It is far more remarkable as an observation of human behavior and the amazing use of light and shade techniques to get the most out of the black and white medium. I am reminded of the German expressionist films (Cabinet of Dr Caligari), which must have influenced Herk Harvey.Our protagonist is the sole survivor of a 'serious emotional event' that she has survived and her friends haven't. She turns up, apparently unharmed afterward and wants to get on with her life, but her life just isn't the same. "I feel separated from other people" she says, and has episodes of fugue, hallucination, and paranoia, not to mention bad dreams! Does this sound anything like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) ? a term that didn't enter medical discourse until much later?Having first-hand experience of what later came to be called PTSD ? which was already affecting Vietnam returnees when this film was released in 1962 ? I can say that Mary's experiences are totally genuine as well as horrific! I'm impressed at the relative understanding shown by the doctor ? 'not a psychiatrist' in the film until he finally throws up his hands in despair as did so many relatives of Vietnam vets at the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>some of the worst acting to be seen in a film=a real scare!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has what is probably some of the worst acting to be found on any film. It also has some of the spookiest scenes to be found anywhere. It has zombie-like characters showing up in the strangest of places. I have to confess that one in particular made me jump in my seat I was so startled by it. I cant tell you any more without having it become a spoiler and Im not into that. This is one of those movies that the producers prob thought would play at a few drive ins and that would be the end of it. Instead we get a film that years later people are just now finding and many liking. Of course this prob will not appeal to those who think of a horror movie as blood and guts and more blood and guts.(In other words the teenager of today).They would be better of with a movie by the much overrated Wes Craven. What it does have is a lot of very spooky scenes made from virtually nothing except the power of suggestion and yes those spooky zombie characters. This movie manages to make an old mattress sliding down an amusement park slide have a spooky element to it. For those of you who want to compare this to the Twilight Zone episode The Hichhiker Im here to say that the two have nothing to do with each other. That episode of the Zone (which is really good scare in itself) was based on an old radio play written years before Carnival was around. So,get yourself a copy of this, turn out all the lights, be ready for some bad acting, and be ready for some jump in your seat scares. Oh, you want to know if this is one of those that you are still thinking about an hour after it's over; yes it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great eerie little movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the fact that everything about this movie screams low-budget, it is one that works out surprisingly effective and original.Actually a bit of a miracle that this movie still exists and is also still easily available and a much seen film. Amazing, since this movie is obviously very low budget and most likely never got a proper release anywhere, back when the movie got done. The camera-work and editing all make it obvious that you're dealing with a low-budget production, that got put together by some not so much experienced persons, within the business. And the same can be said for all of its acting really. No, there really aren't any impressive performances within this movie but yet none of this matters too much, since the movie still manages to be an amazingly great one. In that regard this movie is perhaps very comparable to other low budget genre classics such as George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" and the first "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", even though of course they are part of an entirely different horror sub-genres.The movie is all about its atmosphere and its mysterious build-up. It's a dark movie, mostly because it also got entirely shot in atmospheric black &amp; white. It works well for the movie its story, which is a real horror mystery, that does a good job at remaining both tense and mysterious throughout. Though I must say that this present day none of the themes handled in this movie still come across as anything original and you can also guess what the 'twist' of the movie is, pretty early on. But I can definitely imaging this movie would had been something really new and unseen back during its original release. It's unlike any other horror/mystery from the '60's really, which is all due thanks to its well written and constructed story.It's a great eerie little movie, that becomes one through its fine atmosphere and its great visual moments and little film-making tricks, that also provides the movie with some unforgettable strong and striking sequences.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

This woman is in a car with her friends and before they know it, there is a drag race and the womens car ends up over a bridge. Somehow Mary manages to climb out and survive only to leave town and become a church organist in a different town. Then Mary lives in this house and this guy keeps coming on to her. We think that Mary is going crazy because of a strange man who keeps following her. We find out the truth at the end of the movie.It's a great old movie and something to watch that isn't too scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a childhood nightmare revisited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1989, after more than a quarter-century in limbo, one of the seminal cult horror films of the early '60s finally returned among the living, fully restored to its original length in a newly struck 35mm print. Shot for the most part in Lawrence, Kansas with a largely non-professional cast, the film was quite an achievement for its meager $30,000 budget, but it isn't half as frightening today as childhood memories would have us believe. Nevertheless there's still a lingering air of unease in the story of Mary Henry, an already alienated, small town church organist further removed from reality after a car crash leaves her with one foot on terra firma and the other in a netherworld of lost souls. The bland, passive approach to her role by method actress Candace Hilligoss was perfectly suited to the character's incorporeal detachment, and after four-plus decades the natural campiness of the scenario is offset by director Herk Harvey's striking use of the dilapidated Saltair Pavilion in Utah.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>47 years on, this one off experiment in embarrassingly low budget and high horror class, remains a truly unique motion picture. Herk Harvey, the director of more than four hundred features (be it documentary, fiction, or TV work), never came close to his ghost story of phenomenally twisted ending, one wisely served by 85 bad sounding, trashy looking and, indeed, brilliant preceding minutes. And yet, despite the amateur looks of it, Carnival remains a testament to the true powers of cinema mechanisms. All works for, not against it. Creepy makeup, uninvited apparitions, haunted organ-only soundtrack, clueless acting, all, lead up to a carnival of souls resurrecting and dancing sadly around an unsuspected one. Romero and Shyamalan (to name two) couldn't be without it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An hidden gem of a movie that doesn't get the same press has 'Night of the living dead' even though George Romero states that Carnival of Souls influenced his movie. I think the reason for this is the fact that zombie films are very popular and Night of the Living Dead was the first of its kind.It is kind of hard to review really old movies because they are not as effective or bold compared to films in the past 30 years. So i had to bear that in mind before i popped the DVD in my player! But in fact i was quite surprised.Carnival of Souls itself deserves praise as i think it was ahead of its time in the themes it was presenting throughout the movie, and the the whole movie leaves you in a state of wonder of what just happened. It isn't scary but it is quite eerie. Its like watching a long Twilight Zone episode. The pacing is very slow so if you haven't got a decent attention span then this movie might not be for you.I recommend for people who like layered horror films. It explores a similar theme to that of 'Jacobs Ladder'.Enjoy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a decidedly odd and unnerving film. Director Herk Harvey brilliantly utilises a low-budget and a cast of curious-looking, wooden actors, creating cinematic magic worthy of a twisted Prospero. And there is the wonderfully named lead, Candace Hilligoss, who is actually rather effective as the neurotic, gradually unhinged church organist who is our main identification figure.There is masterly use of music, sound and locations to eerie effect; the whole thing takes on the quality of a truly disturbing bad dream. Deserted fun-fairs, desolate seaside carousels - all in "Eraserhead" style monochrome. Gene Moore's soundtrack is some of the most uncanny, woozy music in the history of cinema, and adds immensely to the desolate, dehumanised atmosphere."Carnival of Souls" is a definite formative influence on Romero and Lynch, and it also works on a primitive Ballardian level too, with its depopulated terminal piers and fun-fairs, and Mary's unusual combination of femme fatale and heroine in peril.Quite a film; those interested in low budget horror cinema, or indeed cinema itself, will watch it and relish the experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a one-shot feature from a director. one can see why, but not with horrible results</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carnival of Souls is another in a long line of films that I have meant to see for quite a lot of years. Maybe it was just the cover on the Criterion DVD, with brilliant illustrations of the main character amid a whirlwind of carnival figures and the dead. Or maybe it was George A. Romero's citing of the film as a major inspiration for his first feature (which is hard not to notice a little bit just in the approach of the zombies). Now having finally seen it (albeit not the Criterion print but a lesser copy as part of its non-copyright status on compilations), it's... something weird. It's not altogether great, and it's in fact something that should have just been a near-perfect half an hour Twilight Zone episode. But as it stands, Carnival of Souls does get to one by its eerie tone and those figures of the dead that slip in and out of the film like out of the corner of one's eye.It's ostensibly about organist Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss in her only real performance - in Herk Harvey's only feature film as director, by the way) who is the only survivor, it would seem, of a car crash off of a bridge into a river. Or... is she alive? This is the basic thrust of the plot of the movie, but really Harvey is out to capture the psychological torment of the character, how she sometimes appears to just disappear in front of people's eyes even as she's right in front of them not being noticed. But the problem with the film is just simply that it's cheaply shot and poorly acted (the guy who plays the drunk is interesting but a real amateur, as is the woman who runs the apartment Mary stays at), and with only a handful of scenes that draw one in seriously into the complex situation of the character.Aside from that, it's kind of, well, laughable. This isn't to say that Harvey is like some Harold P. Warren making a movie on a lark and slithering away forever. Harvey was a professional, with dozens of industrial and educational films under his belt, so he knew his craft and the basics of telling a story. But there are times - and to be fair it could just be the print not being complete or missing a few frames - that scenes jump suddenly or shots are jarringly cut together. This is fine for, say, the climax of the picture with the ballroom of the dead. And to give praise where it's due, there are many minutes spent with Mary walking around that lone faraway location that are just staggering to watch.But at the same time it's not without its faults or scenes that just show its independent low-budget colors, painfully. It's a step in the right direction for psychological horror, especially considering the state of horror at the time with its low-budget equals (i.e. monster and trashy sci-fi). There is that nugget of magic one may have found in a Rod Serling produced episode of his show - how could one not see the premise fit in nicely there - only here surrounded by filler and perhaps way too many scenes of the character walking around or running without much purpose just for the atmosphere, nevermind the story. It's an O-K cult film that's some good fun with friends.</fullReview>

It shows yet again that one doesn't need buckets of blood and gore, multi-million dollar CGI effects, and overpriced, name-recognition actors to sculpt a movie of highly entertaining value and resonance.

Once you realize the methodology of the movie, you should gain a deeper respect for it.It has been pointed out that movie is even more astounding when you realize the small budget that was available for shooting.

		<shortDescription>A Salty Tale to Be Sure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carnival of Souls is one of those rare success stories that rises out of small independent means and a unique individual's vision. Herk Harvey, a man who principally made instructional films, set out to make this little horror thriller on a shoestring budget back in the early 1960s. The story is purposely ambiguous about a girl being thrown into a river in an automobile crash at the film's onset, then moving to Salt Lake, Utah, where she takes a job as an organist, and then she starts having visions of meeting these pasty-faced dead all around her - particularly at this Saltair Palace - an abandoned amusement park. There is virtually no budget here, the acting is very bland from everyone concerned and some of the performances are just downright bad(no acting ability whatsoever), and the dialog is just as bland and bad at times. What makes Carnival of Souls then a classic? Well, there are several things. While the budget does detract from those areas mentioned, it greatly adds to the atmosphere created in the film. The settings - particularly the abandoned Saltair Palace and its desolation are strong images, especially when the dead cavort about. Herk Harvey knows how to use a camera. The vision of faces in water are strong ones or someone being there that a moment ago was not. He gets his audience to jump at the right time. But most importantly is that Harvey made up these dead in a way that would be copied - whether intentionally or not - for many years after from the likes of Romero and many others. The make up and look of these dead is fantastic. Carnival of Souls was the first film that showed them in this manner. The music also adds with that weird organ music stridently playing throughout. Carnival of Souls has its slow moments and it again has some pretty bad performances and dialog. Candace Hilligoss plays Mary the lead and does do a decent enough job making us interested in her. Most of the other performers look like they were around and asked to work for next to nothing. This would normally be a recipe for disaster, but in Herk Harvey's hands Carnival of Souls becomes a masterpiece of mood with its haunting music, eerie location shots, crescendoing tension, and animated dead rising up and out all over the place in a most art-like fashion. The ending nicely caps off the film's mood and theme.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Gothic film is supposedly become a cult favorite. So much so that Criterion has release a two-disk edition of the work.I certainly do not recommend rushing out to purchase it. It is really not that good, and I don't know what prompted its status.It has an eerie feel throughout, but that is because of the persistent organ music. There really isn't much of a story. A girl (Candace Hilligoss) survives an accident and is haunted by visions. The thing that gives a key to a possible mystery is the fact that she is persistent in not wanting human contact. Which is really frustrating to her fellow boarder (Sidney Berger), who tries everything to get in her pants.She displays many of the symptoms of a Schizoid Personality Disorder, but we really don't know where that comes from.Is she crazy? Is she a zombie? Are these visions in her imagination, or are they real?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Carnival Of SPOILERS* A car with two young men in it and another with three girls in it decide to do a drag race, but while on a bridge, the girls lose control of the car, which falls into the river.Everybody thinks that the girls are all dead, but suddenly to everyone's surprise one of the passengers, church organist Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) shows up, muddy and shocked but otherwise unharmed.She decides to move away from the town, taking a job in Utah, but while driving to her destination she is disturbed by a spectral man (Herk Harvey, also the director) who first replaces for a second her reflection in the car window, then appears in front of her car.And even when she arrives to her destination he won't leave her alone, as he seems to follow her anywhere.She also faces a disquieting sense of disconnection from other people, such as them suddenly not being able to see or hear her and an unexplainable attraction to an abandoned carnival.A silmy neighbor, John Linden (Sydney Bergen) tries to seduce Mary, who seems to be unwilling a moment and willing the next one... and who experiences visions of dead people rising from the water near the carnival and dancing in it while playing a hymn on the organ, which seems to cause her to slowly transform the hymn into a disconcerting and eerie music, while her way of playing the instrument becomes lascivious and very allusive...What is up with Mary? Intense, disconcerting and eerie, 'Carnival Of Souls' is a minor classic to which Night Of The Living Dead (the make-up of the dead, the opening and ending credits music), David Lynch (the overall surreality and chilling distortion of reality) and 'The Sixth Sense' (the revelation at the very end) owe a lot; the first and last complete feature directed by educational video veteran Harvey only benefits from the black-and-white photography and the frugality brought on by the fact that the budget for the movie was a measly $ 33,000.The actors are nothing to write home about (except Berger and Hilligoss) but fill their part nicely, and although the final surprise is easy to guess, it still has a little power left, especially after everything we've experienced in the 83 minutes before.Carnival Of Souls (1962): 9/10.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, a creepy dude with black eyes is following her around everywhere she goes! Can she figure out what the hell her stalker wants without endangering herself? While this movie would be considered very predictable by today's standards, I can imagine how horrifying it was in the early 60s. It's an eye-opening glimpse into the roots of some of the most successful modern horror films. The performances are outstanding and it's filmed beautifully in B&amp;W. The settings and attention to detail really help make this one work. Explanations aren't given in this movie and that is part of the reason why it works so well.

		<shortDescription>Cheap, but Decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This here is a cheap film, at least monetarily, that no one could reasonably deny. Most of the actors are little more than amateurs who may have appeared in one or two other pictures. However, that is nearly inevitable, considering the trouble Herk Harvey must have had drumming up support for his independent film. Nevertheless, Carnival of Souls shines on a few points. Our director Herk Harvey notably plays an important role, and judging from his performance, he may well have made a fine actor, at least in the parts of creepy guys who lurk around and say nothing. Also, Mike Nelson of TV's Mystery Science Theater 3000 did a poor job of sufficiently mocking the movie in his scathing commentary, perhaps because the movie isn't poor enough to justify such mockery. Most important of all, Carnival of Souls continues to appeal because of the superb care taken to its ambiance. The off-key organ music is there, lingering from scene to scene, as are the ghoulish figures who roam the night. There is a certain psychological quality about this film that is hard to match elsewhere and leaves you wondering whether all is really as it seems. Cheap? yes. Decent? definitely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Odd but likable cult classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have often times wondered if Carnival of Souls wasn't trying to capitalize on the fame of the Twilight Zone, as this low-budget horror has very many of the same elements found in TZ.Although the acting has something to be desired, and the story jumps around a bit, there is something both creepy and uneasy about this film. The deaths of 3 girls who drown after their car plunges off a bridge sets the mood of this campy yet effective thriller. Although it does have its faults, the camera-work and use of shadows has an almost (using the term very lightly) Hitchcock-ness quality to it.If you watch this late at night with all the lights off, The Carnival of Souls does have some very creepy parts and can give you the willies, so to say. When you first watch this creepy flick, you may at first think what a weird movie...kind of makes no sense...but you soon find yourself wanting to watch it again, and again, and again.Overall, a good, though odd, cult classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genuinely A Very Creepy Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I unfortuanitly had the displeasure of watching "Wes Craven Presents Carnival of Souls" made back in 1998. At this time I did not realize that this was a remake of a cult classic from 1962. I was very disappointed with this film and shoved it aside. About three years ago I found out about the original and went on my search to find a decent copy. I finally just got a copy of this movie and just got done viewing the film. I was very surprised. This is a very good pyschodelic horror film that starts wrapping you up with every minute of the movie. As the story is very simple and the ending is rather predictable by today's standards this movie still works very well. I think if it wasn't filmed in black and white the whole atmosphere to the movie would have been lost and probably not worth watching. This film is a prime example of great lighting and great make up to add a very sinister and genuinely creepy feel. I mean the end of the movie actually gave me goose bumps even though I new exactly how it was going to end. I love old films like this. Many of the horror movies made now a days are directed towards a teenage crowd and much of the serious horror and atmosphere have been taken away. Films like this movie just aren't made anymore. If you are a true fan of horror of all ages (minus the crap coming out now) I highly recommend this excellent horror film. 8 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carnival of Souls is one of my all time favorite horror films. It follows no one else in its camera work, writing, acting, or set design. If you are looking for a John Water's romp, or an Ed Wood epic, stay away from this movie. Yeah, its not perfect, but if you enjoy psychological horror films, check it out. Truly, this was the first horror film that burned itself in my mind. The remarkable thing is that it contains no big special effects, no gore or gross outs, and minimal violence. The heroin of the film is at times cold and distant, and at others compels us to have empathy and fear. Not only is she polarized between two worlds, but the film in itself is. By the way, avoid the colorized version like the plague. Why Fox home video and Mike Nelson thought it was a good idea, I have no clue. So remember,if you're the kind of person who thought Darkness Falls or the remake of The Haunting was great horror, don't see this film. For the rest of you, see it now.</fullReview>

The opening is awful.Two cars meet at a junction, we have some clunking establishing shots of the passenger of one of the cars as she pulls faces. The cars race from a set of lights, they drive past a Danger sign, and onto a bridge then one of them sort of falls into the river for no apparent reason. People gather stand and stare into the swirling water. We are told (twice) that they may never find the car. A sheriff half-heartedly throws something on a piece of string into the water. It's clumsy, clunking film-making, I couldn't for the life of me understand what all the fuss that has been made about this movie was about But then something happens. One of the girls in the lost car crawls out from the mud and a strange, lyrical, eerie, weird, scary little movie slowly starts to emerge with her.What I'm trying to say here is stick with it.

		<fullReview>This is what a horror film should be. No gore, no blood, no guts, no loud noises or cheap special effects but it still manages to disturb you. This film doesn't depend on violence or cheap thrills. This film depends on the basic things that scare people. The imagery will unsettle you and combined with the music it will disturb you. A true masterpiece that will mess with your mind. You can get a cheap jump out of your seat thrill with a loud noise and gory scene in Jason but this movie will leave you unsettled long after you watch it. It starts off slow and looking cheap but gets a lot better. The acting is good by the main character, Candace Hilligoss, and the main zombie, a tad out of date but above average by the supporting cast. References to the devil, organ music, and zombies dancing will disturb you. I would compare it to The Omen, that kind of scary rather then Jason and that kind of scary. A great horror movie, still stands up and excels today and a must see for anybody that is serious about horror movies or film making in general, this is how its done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mary, an emotionally distant and somewhat cold young woman, walks away from a car accident that has killed her two friends. She claims to have no memory of the accident. She soon leaves town to accept a position as a church organist in distant Salt Lake...but something has followed her. A ghoulish man stalks her, unseen by anyone else. Her senses occassionally abandon her, leaving her stranded in a soundless world where no one can see her or hear her. The normally withdrawn woman, who at one point claims that she has no desire for the close company of other people, begins to break down. Her jerk boyfriend dumps her, her boss fires her, her landlady is fed up with her. As the world of the living falls away piece by piece, abandoning her, the deserted pavilions on the edge of town loom larger and its ghostly inhabitants are eager to have her join their world.This is a spooky, disturbing film with powerful imagery and profound silences. Mary is also not typical of 1960s horror movie heroines; she does not care for people and makes no bones about it. She does not depend on anyone to help her and does not expect anyone to save her. Mary is truly alone. She is strong, even when she is frightened. In the end, she is just like anyone else, grasping at what she has already lost, having realized too late how precious life is...and how short.I can understand how this film inspired Romero to create his Living Dead films; this is a creepy, moody film, somehow seeming as cold as the grave even in the bright light of the daytime scenes. The long stretches of silence are very uncomfortable, and the thoughts that fill them are most unsettling. The ghouls are quite effective, leering and hungry and almost seductive as they dance, luring Mary into their midst. Candace Hilligoss is wonderful as Mary. I read somewhere once that she was never told what her character motivations were, or what was truly supposed to be happening, and that the confused expression on her face was genuine...and was exactly what director Harvey wanted. It works, as she wanders like an insomniac through a nightmare world, wide-eyed and lost. The ending was quite shocking, considering the time period it was filmed in. True, I saw it coming, but it was still most satisfying. This film left me with a true feeling of dread, and a desire to sleep with the lights on. This film is the inspiration for too many films to name, and shouldn't be missed. It's powerful and well done, a true classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Spoiler warning)----- Carnival of Souls is one of the creepiest films out there. And sadly few people seem to know of its existence. It's an inexpensive film made in a small town (Lawrence, Kansas, I believe), but the director and actors gave a great grasp of what's creepy, and especially of what's surreal. The film has a dream-like quality that makes the events all the more nightmarish. It's hard to make something like having your transmission checked in a garage scary, yet it happens in this film. I can't prove it, but I believe this film may have been inspired by an early episode of The Twilight Zone called 'The Hitch-hiker', where a woman believes she has survived a minor misshap on the road, only to go on a surreal odyssey that culminates in her realization that she has died.</fullReview>

Suffice to say that, in my view, a movie without flaws is not necessarily a perfect movie. So to Carnival of Souls has wonky camera work, slightly shaky acting and low budget effects holds little validity as long as the spirit is there (and, puns intended, this film has plenty of em). I first saw this film at a 'film buff' type screening which most people attending laughed most of the way through although I found it strangely moving.There is almost a sense of 'teen angst' isolation in the main characters ghost-like meanderings and her rejection of a society of lecherous men, condescending physician and muttering old ladies. Add to this the totally flawless setting for the desolate lake- side carnival and you have the endearing, hidden classic many critics have explored. I only wish there was a little less of the 'organ' music at the start, anymore and you could be felling a little delusional yourself.P.S. Avoid the Wes Craven remake at all cost. Unless you prefer (limited) style of substance and lacklustre performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good low budget horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Granted this movie has some budgetary limitations, that it, for the most part, transcends. The use of silence and sound in this movie is fascinating and surreal. The plot while overly predictable to modern viewers, set the stage for many subsequent horror films. Unlike many films of interest to film history buffs this movie is still suspenseful. The cinematography is quirky and riddled with close-ups and other shots that seem heavily influenced by the German expressionist silent film canon and is heavily visual, which is really unusual since it seems to fit this story, which uses many of the conventions of 50s horror. It is also unusual since most low-budget horror/sci-fi films of this era tend to try to relay much of the action through dialogue, because it's cheaper. This movie does have some shortcomings, namely some of the minor actors are fairly shoddy ie: the doctor is pretty awful. At times, the editing and camerawork is a little off ie: 180 degree lines are noticably broken, cuts involving creative geography are often unintentionally jarring since it tends to leave out things like the front of a house. Arguably that could be to further the jarring effect of the film. I doubt it though, seeing as these were first time filmmakers. I was also disappointed with all the loose ends at the end of the movie. Despite some flaws, this movie is quite recommended. A little predictable but definitely of interest for pretty much everyone who want a scary movie thats a little offbeat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Carnival of Souls" is a quietly restrained horror film filled with creepy images, grand setpieces (the climactic 'dance' sequence is fittingly eerie), and a brooding organ musical score. Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) is a faithless organ player who is the only survivor of a car accident; she begins a new life in an idyllic Utah suburb, only to be haunted by images of a ghostly stranger (played by Herk Harvey, who also directed) who may or may not be real. Mary gradually loses her sanity, and attributes her hallucinations and bad dreams to a foreboding, abandoned carnival pavilion, where she finally goes to confront her fears. Subtle, atmospheric, well-acted, and filled with nightmarish imagery, "Carnival of Souls" is one of the underrated gems of horror. (Avoid the 1998 'remake' at all costs.) 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although some might call this film predictable, or its effects primitive, one must keep in mind that this film was released in 1962 and made for very little money by largely independent filmmakers. As such, this is an amazing little film that was ahead of its time. Truly atmospheric, creepy, and haunting (by the way, I didn't find the ending all *that* predictable). The make-up and effects are actually very effective, as their low-budget nature adds to a sense of surrealism and an "off center"-ness that wonderfully complements the tone and plot.

		<shortDescription>Fondly remembered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the late 1960s Melbourne TV ran a series of low budget horror movies called Aweful Movies With Deadly Earnest, which were for the most part awful, and sometimes deadly awful. But there were a few which were memorable for me, and this in particular was one of them. At the time I doubt whether this was considered a "cult" film, and I certainly wouldn't have known that then, even if it was. All I know is that I found it pretty scary [even now I remember the way certain scenes jolted me at the time] and strangely affecting.[Course I was a lot younger then].Anyway, the years went by, and although to my knowledge it never turned up on TV here again, it remained a particularly fondly and clearly remembered film of its type, and I hoped that I would one day get to see it again to see how it held up. Recently I had the opportunity to do just that, but this time on the big screen at a specialist theatre here. And I can honestly say that although it certainly didn't pack the same punch fright-wise that it did all those years ago, and although I was certainly more aware of all its limitations in regard to budget and acting etc than I would have been back then, I certainly wasn't disappointed. [This was in spite of the snickers and laughter the film generated in some quarters of the audience].Why? Because the film generates a certain other-worldly atmosphere which I have seldom seen in films then or since. For me this overcomes any failings which Carnival of Souls might have in its more tangible aspects such as acting or plot-line [although in saying that I should also suggest that back in 1962 this plot-line for a movie was probably pretty unique] This atmosphere appeals to me now, as it did back then, and it helps to explain why I remembered it so strongly for so long. Now I can't explain technically how this is achieved - I don't even know if it was intended to be achieved - but for me it helps overcome explain why this film has become a "cult" item. It might also help to explain the gulf in opinion in regard to the reviews submitted for this film, because obviously people either hate it or love it. My theory is that just like that part of the audience who laughed and snickered at the screening I went to, some people view any film with a certain attitude of mind which renders them less open to those aspects of any film which are not so tangible. [Tangible being things like plot, acting, etc, those less tangible being mood, atmosphere etc].Anyway, there must be some reason why so many people hold such an obscure little item in enough regard for it to become the cult item it has become.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much has been written about this 1962 classic film and a remake was even made in 1998, but the film still remains an enigma. The lighting, camera work, makeup and music score are all very original and still manage to haunt 40 years after it's release. The remake was a decent idea gone bad. Don't even bother with it.In 1962, industrial film director Herk Harvey decided to make a horror film. He had previously made about 40 films for school and industry with such titles as: What About School Spirit? (1958), Caring for Your Toys (1954) , Street Safety Is Your Problem (1952) and Your Junior High Days (1961). He enlisted the help of fellow Kansans John Clifford (screenplay) and Maurice Prather (cinematographer) to help him and they recruited local talent to act in the film. The lead character, Mary Henry (played by Candice Hilligloss), only appeared in one other film. Most of the other actors have this movie as their only film acting credit.There are many dvd releases of this film. Even the cheapest and most no frills copy would be worth owning and watching. The one that stands far above the rest however is the Criterion Collection version. This 2 disk set has all of the features listed below:DISC ONE: THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL VERSION -New digital transfer of the original theatrical version- The Movie That Wouldn't Die! The Story of Carnival of Souls: a documentary on the 1989 reunion of the cast and crew - More than 45 minutes of rare outtakes accompanied by Gene Moore's organ score - Theatrical trailer - An illustrated history of the Saltair resort in Salt Lake City- The Carnival Tour: a video update on the film's locations- English subtitles for the deaf and hearing impaired - Optimal image quality: RSDL dual-layer editionDISC TWO: THE EXTENDED DIRECTOR'S CUT - Selected audio commentary by screenwriter John Clifford and late director Herk Harvey - One hour of excerpts from films made by the Centron Corporation, an industrial film company based in Lawrence, Kansas that employed Harvey and Clifford for over 30 years - An essay on the history of Centron from Ken Smith's Mental Hygiene- Printed interviews with Harvey, Clifford, and star Candace Hilligoss, illustrated with vintage photos and memorabilia - English subtitles for the deaf and hearing impairedIt's quite the dvd set and you will know everything there is to know about all of the principles involved. I understand that this also may not be a good thing for some people...So the basic story is that Mary Henry is involved in a drag race in rural Kansas that results in her car driving off of a bridge into a river. She manages to walk away from the accident, but afterwards she is haunted by a ghoulish looking man. She ends up getting a job as an organist at a church in Salt Lake City but is still seeing the ghoul man. She also starts feeling compelled to go to an old, abandoned carnival. This is the basic story and I don't want to give away any more for those of you who have not seen the movie.This really is a classic and somewhat of a landmark film. After making this film, Herk Harvey and John Clifford continued working for the same industrial film company as if nothing had happened. Over the years the movie started fading away from peoples memory until the advent of VHS tapes. The movie was a popular rental and it developed a cult following which prompted Candice Hilligloss to contact an aging Herk Harvey to try and make a sequel or remake. This fell through but eventually a remake (of sorts) was made titled "Wes Craven Presents: Carnival of Souls". John Clifford has the lead writing credit and at least one actor from the original, Sidney Berger, appears in the remake. But this is not an endorsement to rush out and see the remake. And this is not from some purists viewpoint either. It is simply confusing and nonsensical and resembles the original in title only. As for the original, buy it, watch it, make others watch it.</fullReview>

I bought this in a double pack, and had never watched it. made pop corn, turn'd off all the lights, and let the fun begin. the budget was small, the dubbing was a bit off, and the acting was limited.

		<fullReview>Any young filmmaker who wants to see what can be done with a minimum of money and effects should see "Carnival of Souls". It's a combination of horror, psychology, and wit made on the barest thread of a budget. I never saw any of Herk Harvey's institutional movies, but in this, his one attempt at a full-length feature, he succeeds in giving a surface of classic suspense, stirred by the rich undercurrents of the human soul's hell. He weaves all this into a production that could easily be done for a price in five figures even now.Listen to what he does with sound-- or the lack of it. Watch how he lights a Utah plain. See how he creates a crazy, Midwestern Hades with simple lighting and make-up. He found sets that could be had for next-to-nothing, took advantage of(and perhaps encouraged) the stiffness of amateur actors, and created a sense of distance so real that four decades later it still probes your innards for every empty spot.This should be an inspiration to anyone working on a low-budget indie: find the vision, get the most from everyone's talent, and you can make a shining gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As others have said, this plays like a Twilight Zone episode. In fact, the story in broad outline is exactly like the TZ episode "The Hitch-Hiker", which first aired in 1959 or 1960, just before Carnival of Souls.The earnest self-confidence of the director and actors (especially the "zombies") is essential to this film's success; it could have so easily slipped away into camp or farce. The low-budget rough edges somehow add to the creepy atmosphere, and there are some inventive camera shots and compositions; a good example is the shot, from several stories up, of the girl on a street leaning against a tall building--a shot that efficiently conveys the girl's state of mind: disorientation, confusion, oppression.I understand that this was resurrected some years ago for a Halloween showing in theaters. I wish they'd do it again; it'd be the perfect Halloween flick: scary only if you're in the mood to be scared.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw Carnival of Souls in the late 1960s on Chiller Theater, Channel 11 Pittsburgh. If you are not familiar with Chiller Theater, it was one of the horror/sci-fi movie shows of the era, and one of the best. In fact, if you are a fan of the genre, you might remember host Bill Cardille ("Chilly Billy") in a bit part in Night of the Living Dead (the reporter near the end of the movie).I was about 8 or 9 when I saw this movie first. To say it had a lasting impressions would be a gross understatement. I still consider it one of, if not THE scariest movie ever made. Why? Because it plays with the mind. The images Herk Harvey (director) captures are unforgetable, surreal, and lasting. The old lakeside carnival, combined with excellent use of black and white celluloid, create a unique and haunting phantasm for the mind.Don't believe me? Watch it alone in a dark room some evening... if you dare!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, don't bother with the late 90's remake as this version is a classic, and the later remake 'softens' certain elements of this version which detract from the overall terror of the plot. If Freud had made a movie about the themes of trauma, wish fulfillment, and repetition, this would have been it. The movie isn't so scary as it is intriguing and manic. The cinematography is quite sophisticated and the score is strange. You get the feeling that you're in the middle of a large patch of cells undergoing mitosis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quality horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carnival of Souls is one of the best horror films of the 60s and an obvious influence to the superior Night of the Living Dead. The basic plot is that a young woman survives a car wreck, but finds herself being stalked by a strange man who seems to appear out of nowhere and then disappear back into the darkness he came from. The man's stalking leads to many creepy moments through out the film, both due to the actor and the skill of the director. The actor has a very creepy stare and has this thing about him that just wreaks of death. Harvey's direction is better than solid. This film has a really creepy atmosphere and even made me jump a bunch of times. I must also credit the lead for carrying the film and giving a very believeable performance. She never really seemed like she was acting. There is one huge flaw though. I already knew the ending after the first three minutes. Even if it hadn't been ripped off countless times after, it still would've been pretty obvious. It doesn't tarnish how effective this movie was, but I would've preferred something a bit more unexpected. Despite that one huge flaw, I highly recommend Carnival of Souls.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible Spoilers!Made with a limited amount of money, Carnival of Souls shows what can be done when someone uses creativity to make up for a lack a big budget. Hilligoss really shines in this film, and you wish she had made many more films in her career. Her apparent survival of a car crash into a river and being followed by a zombie like figure throughout the rest of the film is well written and carefully planned, which shows how much effort and dedication went into making this movie.Hilligoss plays Mary Henry as an independent, strong-willed young woman, a rarity in horror films of the early 1960s when most women were portrayed either as victims or as helpless. Mary Henry's determined nature leads her to try to confront who or what had been following her in her travels, but this leads ultimately to a horrifying conclusion. Hilligoss herself has an attractive yet down to earth appearance, and this lets her make Mary Henry look like a pretty girl next door.While primarily a horror film, Carnival of Souls also portrays what everyday life was like in the early 1960s in America; many people are shown in everyday settings, and it seems like a lot of them aren't really acting but just carrying on with the regular course of the day. Great footage of the abandoned pavilion and the surrounding salt flats as well; watching the movie makes you want to explore the old buildings or wander out onto the vast expanse of desert yourself.Carnival of Souls is a classic, and holds all of its shock value even forty years later. The low budget actually adds to its value, as it seems like a large budget would have resulted in a film of less quality (watch the film and you'll understand what I mean). Be sure to keep the lights on while this one is rolling!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie on TV when I was child of 11 and taking organ lessons at the time. Well, it definately made an erie impression. When I discovered it was a cult film after I grew up, I was not surprised! If your the type of person who does not understand brilliantly bad, bad being so good, then this is not for you. Personally, anyone whofails to see the haunting quality of this film which is perfectly complimented by the creepy, lovely soundtrack of organ music is definately someone I would not be friends with. Candace Hilligloss, as Mary Henry is so perfect in this part! Just imagine a Gwyneth Paltrow type girl but a little more exagerated crossed with a haute couture mannequin of the early 1960's. She's very unique which makes her bad acting work very well in this film! The ghouls look like New Wave goth kids ala Robert Smith of The Cure! I wonder if he knows that his look was influenced by Herk, the director? I own the video and have seen this movie many many times. One of my favorite scenes is the one where Mary freaks out at the church organ while practicing and goes into a trance. I also love love love the dancers in the pavilion! I mean, as a kid I was hooked! What a great technique to speed up the film and add that ghostly laughter! Those were the days when people really knew what creativity is all about! See this movie! I also own the soundtrack. It's fantastic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw "Carnival of Souls" on one of New York City's smaller TV stations in the early 1970s, and I've seen it a couple of times since. Shot cheaply in black &amp; white by a Lawrence, Kansas, industrial filmmaker named Herk Harvey, the film is not very strong on character, dialogue or acting. Viewers will mostly remember key scenes shot in what could best be described as a German Expressionist style, with lots of shadows and distorted depths of field. Candace Hilligoss plays a neurotic church organist involved in a car accident just before she moves to another city to take a new position. At night in her reverie she finds herself drawn to a pavilion (shot at an actual abandoned pavilion in Utah) and keeps seeing a smiling, pasty-faced man who follows her around or, at one point, rises out of a brackish pool of water. In one of the film's most effective scenes, she enters a dream state while playing the organ and watches a group of ghouls moving toward her in the pavilion, while the music she's playing goes into a creepy minor-key melody that moves with the herky-jerky movements of the creatures chasing her, until a pair of hands come toward her and smash the organ keys into a discordant chord that threatens to open the gates of hell. The hands belong to the church's pastor, who fires her immediately because he believes she's been possessed by evil. From then on it's all downhill as the ghouls begin chasing her through the streets of Lawrence. Candace Hilligoss, one of the few trained actors in "Carnival of Souls," has a long, odd face and a birdlike, distrustful demeanor that fit the film perfectly. At certain angles she becomes spookier than the ghouls. All these supernatural goings-on make a nice contrast against the real streets, boarding houses, gas stations and stores of Lawrence (1962 frozen in time), as well as the hyper-reality created by Harvey's use of mostly non-professional actors. The ghouls in white makeup with dark eyes, moving like silent movie characters because Harvey slowed down the camera speed, almost certainly inspired the makers of "Night of the Living Dead" five or six years later. If you haven't seen "Carnival of Souls," you must find it and set aside a night's viewing. Despite the low budget and low-tech special effects, this is probably one of the creepiest and truly chilling movies you'll ever see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS:This low-budget ($28,000, I heard) anticipates SIXTH SENSE and THE OTHERS in that it also deals with a character who's dead but doesn't know it. A great idea, if it is done well, and I think that in these three movies it is.At first, we think that Mary may be the sole survivor of an accident. But as the film progresses, we see more and more of her alienation from the people around her, some of whom don't even see her. She is between two worlds, but is gradually being pulled toward the carnival of souls, the world of the dead (where her soul apparently already is, I believe. It's been a while since I've seen it)I agree with those who think that this movie demonstrates that large budgets and F/X aren't needed to make a good horror movie. This, and NIGHT MONSTER prove that it's the basic idea, plus the way it is handled that makes a good horror flick. Money in the hands of talentless writers and directors is just wasted. These clowns think that horror lies in blood being spattered around. It is they who are scary, not their movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Carnival Of Souls' had me hooked from the first ten minutes. This is one of the most extraordinary movies of all time! Forget the horror tag - even though it IS frightening - because like another overlooked 60s movie, 'Peeping Tom', it might give you a preconceived idea of what it "should" be before you even watch it. Just open your mind and take it for what it is, an utterly unique nightmare, with an atmosphere somewhere between Val Lewton and David Lynch. 'Carnival Of Souls' shows that massive budgets and sophisticated special effects are not what is great about horror, fantasy or science fiction movies. It is IMAGINATION. Sure this is low budget, some of the acting is below par, and some bits are creaky, but the rest of the movie more than compensates for it. Too bad more contemporary film makers don't take a lesson from Herk Harvey!You will never forget this movie!</fullReview>

Candace Hilligoss does a fantastic job as Mary Henry; a beautiful woman who's character is quieter and different from the rest.

		<fullReview>Carnival of Souls is one of those movies that comes around every once in a while which I consider to be very cool and appealing, and yet somehow both highly under AND over rated.Herk Harvey's appearance as the dead-looking man makes up the bulk of the horror material. his initial sudden turn-up outside the window of a moving car caused me to jump. the shot of Harvey which immediatley follows is both surreal and electricfying. I'm tingling as I write about it. unfortunatley, soon after the film begins to lag and slow, which has positive and negative aspects. the main character's disassociation with the rest of the world is drawn out and out, but unfortunately it's rather boring (and, during the scenes in which she is rendered invisible, rather cheesy) as well. this cheese is, however, I may add, only on farther recollection - when you're watching the film it's both plausible and eerie.that's the biggest problem with the movie, actually. it's very eerie and involving when viewed, but afterwards the magic fades away. still, every self respecting film student or fan should see it, not only because it's influental, but because it's a damn creepy film and an example of no-budget cinema at a kind of penultimate level.highly recommended, even if it does have problems.</fullReview>

If you can just relax, turn off all the lights and turn the sound up, you can't fail to be chilled.The technical inadequacies add to the surreal, dream-like status of the film. I love the way there is only gentle organ music and blowing wind near the end under the pier. The heavy, clunking footsteps that prevail on the soundtrack sound death-like, exaggerated and very, very unreal.The photography is beautiful (and can probably only be appreciated on the big screen, or on Criterion's exquisite DVD). The final dance is almost magical. The way Mary sees herself in death is extraordinary. Shots like Mary's first night in the boarding house, staring wide-eyed out of the dripping window, with thunder booming.It should only be viewed late at night, with NO lights on, with the sound turned up, with a mug of cocoa.

Yes a small summary was written on the back of the video jacket, but that still didn't even touch the power of that movie or what I was really going to see whan I saw the movie.It starts out OK, the movie with the drag race and the tragic accident on the bridge where it appears that the three girls have drowned. After about three hours our heroine Candace Hillgoss comes out on a sandbar fully shaken up (why not--after all she was just involved in a fatal accident where two of her friends were killed).She almost immediately leaves town and goes to Utah to play the organ in the church. On the way to Utah and throughout the rest of the movie, that's where the fun(?) begins. How would you like to be driving along and then all of a sudden a ghoul's face appears in the window. (I'm getting cold shivers up and down my body as I am writing this). I would drive off the road myself.At that point, you seem to know something is definitely wrong with her whole life scenario. Is she really dead? Should she have survived the accident?As the movie progresses, we get to see what the real story seems to be re Mary Henry. I won't give it away, but for sure the viewer seems to be pulled in many directions along with Mary and even then we, the viewers, still are not sure 100% whether Mary is alive or dead.I watched this movie during the day, Sunday, by myself and I still at this writing (about 3:30AM Monday morning) still have the creeps.Fantastic movie!!!!!!!!Maybe when I get the courage to watch it again, I will!!!!!

		<fullReview>(Warning: there are minor spoilers below)After viewing the horrible remake of "Carnival of Souls" I could only think about how wonderful the original is. In fact, I think it still holds up today as a truly scary work of art, bursting with creativity and style, and I think it's influence will be felt for years to come (the remake, however, will be forgotten by all except the most devout Larry Miller fans). The story is simple, as is the story telling, but that's okay, because this is more of a visual movie (like Tim Burton's best work). Shot in stylish black and white, this movie has jump-out-of-your-seat shocks (The ghoul appearing in the car's window makes me jump every time, just like those creepy twins in "The Shining") as well as hauntingly beautiful images (The whole dream-like visit to the abandoned fun house). The scenes of the ghosts are not hokey at all, unlike other mid-sixties "horror" movies.Despite a few slow points here and there, this is a genuinely good movie, ranking right behind "Night of the Living Dead" on the list of great, low budget, black and white scare flicks of the mid-1960s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psycho Meets The Twilight Zone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film's protagonist, Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss), reminds me of the ill-fated Marion Crane in "Psycho" (1960). They're both about the same age, have similar appearances, and make fateful journeys in a car, in the Western U.S.But the story in "Carnival Of Souls" is more like an extended episode of "The Twilight Zone". A lovely, frightened young woman, victim of an auto accident, shows up in Utah as a church organist, but suffers from visions of a strange man who follows her wherever she goes. To complicate matters, at times she seems invisible to people around her, but not always. Nobody understands her dilemma.From the get-go, viewers understand that "Carnival Of Souls" is low-budget. Production design is weak; secondary performances are amateurish. And the plot is choppy, with jarring scene splices. But that intermittent organ music and the noirish B&amp;W lighting engender a trance-like feel that propels the viewer's interest in Mary and her story.But that story doesn't really lead anywhere. And the plot is peppered with filler scenes and contrivances. For example, why is Mary so drawn to the Pavilion? We're never told. It just seems like a locale that the film's director had access to, and therefore could use for various scenes. But it's not organic to the story. And what does the spooky old man who follows Mary have to do with Mary's car accident? Does he symbolize death? Again, we're never told.This offbeat story hints, implies, and suggests. But there's no payoff, no resolution. And the viewer is left to interpret the film's meaning. Maybe the point of the story is merely to evoke a certain eerie atmosphere or an abnormal mental state."Carnival Of Souls" does have its strengths. Candace Hilligoss is well cast, and she gives a very nice performance. Further, the lighting is fine, and when combined with that Gothic organ music induces a sense of dread and foreboding.Far from being ahead of its time, as some have suggested, the film strikes me as typical of dramas from the early 1960s. If the story had been condensed to a thirty minute television drama, I can just hear Rod Serling interject at the end: "And so, Mary Henry, anxious to leave home for a new life elsewhere takes an unexpected detour, and finds herself in ... the twilight zone".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psychic isolation represented in landscape.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gallons of ink have been devoted, (justifiably) to this film. But few have perhaps paid sufficient due to the cinematographer, Maurice Prather.Mr. Prather aids and abets the script at every turn in his rendering of Miss Hilligoss's (in the role of Mary Henry) isolation from those around her. From his crow's nest shots of her wandering through the deserted carnival to the scenes of her lone sedan traversing the twilight prairie highway, he unfailingly delivers a picture of un-peopled vastness--a vastness that cannot be breached by human or psychic outreach.And that is what this film is really about--Mary Henry's inability to accept the fact that she has already departed from the world she continues to haunt.Ultimately she knows, (as does her personal Charon--the Carnival Ghoul) that she must be reclaimed--and it is in her persistent refusal to yield to his summons, from which the conflict and tension of the film springs.This is perhaps revealed most disquietingly in a scene near the beginning of the film, when the minister accompanies her to take a look at the abandoned carnival--but refuses to accompany her across the barricade. Thus, though the visit is without ostensible horrific incident--it concludes with a silhouette of the Carnival Ghoul dropping his head in resignation from behind a gated doorway inside the pavilion, while at the very same moment, Miss Hilligoss, (seemingly safe in a car already miles away) is stabbed with a sudden deja vu--reflected with a rueful knowing in her eyes--one of many brilliant moments in a film brimming with them.And it should not merely be to the cognoscente that such an inevitable moment as this, terrifies far more meaningfully, than any knife wielding Friday the 13th slasher might.As to Mr. Prather, note how similar are the contrast and tone levels he uses to depict the vast American mid-western landscapes under over-cast skies, to that used by Sven Nykvist in Bergman's "Winter Light." Though the Bergman film is set in Sweden--surely the similarity is not coincidental.Indeed, some scenes call to mind Caspar David Friedrich, as in the shot of Mary on the sandbar approaching her rescuers on the bridge--a heart in your mouth visual if there ever was one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carnival of Souls (1962) is the perfect example of making a horror film on a tight budget. The film makers didn't need a huge budget or flashy special effects . The movie was designed to scare and shock people. A young lady is a soul survivor of a horrific car accident that has claimed the lives of everyone in the car that she was driving. But ever since the day of the accident, the world seems to be a very strange place. People treat her like an outcast and a strange man has been following her around town like a shadow. Theses incidents have driven the poor girl to the brink of insanity. Who or what is behind this madness? Carnival of Souls is a true classic. It was films like this and Night of the Living Dead that redefined the horror genre. If you enjoy films that rely on genuine scares instead of cheap ones, this movie is just for you. But if you like movies that spoon feed you anything and everything then I suggest that you look elsewhere. The director created a real thriller. Too bad he went back to making industrial shorts. He could have been another great horror director.Strongly recommended. Avoid the remake. It is terrible to the Nth degree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Flawed Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carnival of Souls is a one-off. Literally. It was the only feature film Herk Harvey ever directed (his other work was industrial training films) and it was the only film many of its actors appeared in. But what truly makes the film unique is the approach Harvey took to generating scares. While most early 1960's horror films were either cheesy drive-in fare of the 'I Was A Teenage...' variety, or a colour remake of a Universal horror film, 'Carnival of Souls' is an original tale that, in its subtle eeriness is similar to nothing of its time, and the only recent films that evoke the same, all-pervading sense of dread and impending doom are Japanese movies such as the Ring series. Like these recent Oriental efforts, CoS doesn't shout 'boo!' at the audience in the manner of other horror tales that mechanically produce scares (which are usually so predictable that they're not scary). Rather, Herk Harvey took his time and drew the audience in to a revelation that may seem predictable now, but at the time had a real impact (and it's only predictable because subsequent movies have stolen the idea, such as Jacob's Ladder and The Sixth Sense).Candace Hiligoss makes for a compelling central character, her unconventional looks giving the character of Mary an ethereal, fragile quality, which makes the viewer sympathise a great deal with her plight as she comes to suspect she's losing her mind. The rest of the cast don't really get a chance to make an impact, with the definite exception of Herk Harvey himself, who plays the ghostly figure that Mary keeps seeing. The image of Harvey's white face with black-rimmed eyes is simple, but like Ring's Sadako, one that will haunt you for a long time after the film is over. If anything, the fact that so little is known about Harvey makes him more sinister. When you watch Frankenstein (1931) and the monster appears, you knows it's just Boris Karloff under a lot of make-up, because Karloff made over a hundred films and his face is well known, even thirty-five years after his death. Herk Harvey, by contrast, is a man whose face most people only know from 'Carnival of Souls', so it has much more of an impact.This films isn't perfect, however. The final sequence, where the dead are chasing Mary along the beach, is a bit silly when it should be spine-chilling, and I have to admit that the ending confused me slightly. In Jacob's Ladder, it turns out that Tim Robbins was hallucinating just before he died, and nothing was real, but in CoS, things aren't so clear-cut. Was Mary a ghost? A Zombie? Something else? Her body never left the car after it went off the bridge, but she physically interacted with regular people in a 'real' situation, something ghosts aren't supposed to be able to do. Plus, she left handprints in the sand before disappearing, which meant she had physical form, but her body was in the lake.One interesting sidenote is that Sidney Berger, who plays Mary's love interest, has only made two movies in his life and they're both called 'Carnival of Souls', the other being the Wes Craven-produced remake</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time is no movie's friend (spoilers?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(I put a question mark after (spoilers) 'cause gee whiz, it's been almost forty years now. Still, maybe one person'll read this having not seen the movie or read the other reviews.) Praising this movie as a good or great "low-budget" flick kinda reminds me of Samuel Johnson's famous remark about female preachers: "It's like a dog walking on its hind legs: it's not done well, but it is surprising to see it done at all." Damning with faint praise, that is. I never cared how much a movie (or anything else) cost: it's either done well, or not. "Souls" is a huge snorefest for most of its running. When the woman emerged from the water after the car wreck with that bizarre stare on her face, I sensed almost immediately what the "twist" was gonna be, &amp; I saw it before all the recent movies about people not knowing they're dead. But I thought "Well if they all drowned in the car then all their ghosts should be appearing &amp; since it's just the one, maybe she did miraculously get out of the car somehow, so let's see." Then followed a series of bland scenes with stilted dialogue. It didn't seem like "real life" at all; real people're a lot more animated than that. I did like the woman's general indifference to other people, especially the cardboard would-be Lothario, that was kinda unusal for the time, although I would've liked it better without this back-of-my-mind suspicion that I knew the real reason for it (see above). The best scenes were when she would periodically become unseen &amp; unheard by others, there was a great naturalistic creepiness achieved there. But as soon as the white-faced guy made his appearance, it was pretty much over for me. Couldn't take it seriously after that. The speeded-up action of the ghosts was like an old silent movie &amp; I guess the director got the effect he wanted, but it had nothing to do with what had been developed previously, it was as though he just replaced one movie with another. Then it was just a matter of waiting for the final scene that even in 1962 everyone must've known was coming &amp; that clearly had been borrowed from the final shot in "Psycho" a few years previously. But I agree there was great location work &amp; effective cinematography, although with that old black-&amp;-white film stock it was hard to go wrong. They don't make that film stock any more &amp; black-&amp;-white movies today look like crap, in my view. But bottom line I don't hate "Carnival of Souls," it was worth a look, I just can't accept it as some long-lost gem, unless one wants to compare it with tons of shlock in about the same cost-range, but again, I don't care what a movie cost to make. This movie reminds me somewhat of "The Blair Witch Project," another low-budget cult favorite that I think gets better in the memory the longer ago one saw it &amp; that also featured long boring stretches with a few effective moments. I mean hey, it's very commendable to want to cut a cheaply made flick lots of slack, part of our whole modern PC culture of constantly "levelling playing fields," but consider this: if "Souls"' director had had the dough to give it a professional-studio look, would anyone care about it now? Wasn't its whole "virtue" kinda born of necessity? Jump ahead a few years: did "Night of the Living Dead" become a classic because it also was cheaply made? or rather because of the warped genius of George Romero?</fullReview>

But I'm glad he only made one feature, that he didn't keep spinning out horrible movies one after another, diluting his talent.The genius of this movie is in its details. The speeded-up footage during that phantom dance scenes, the vacant look of Mary, the clever editing. As far as I'm concerned, Harvey could have spent $30,000 on the shot of his ghostly face in Mary's car window alone. It's that striking, it's that good. I applaud Harvey for attaching his name to only this film, it only adds to its mysteriousness and resonance.Why don't more directors approach film from this angle? If Ed Wood had made only one movie, I bet it'd be pretty good. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvelously eerie early 60's indie horror gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aloof and fiercely independent young lass Mary Henry (well played with icy resolve by beautiful blonde Candace Hilligoss) survives a traumatic car accident. Mary accepts a new job as a church organist. However, Mary finds herself more and more detached from the world around her as she succumbs to the odd allure of an old abandoned lakeside pavilion.Director Herk Harvey relates the absorbing story at a hypnotically deliberate pace, grounds the fantastic premise in a thoroughly plausible workaday reality, does a masterful job of crafting and sustaining a supremely spooky ooga-booga gloom-doom atmosphere rife with dread and foreboding, makes excellent use of the rundown main fairground location, and pulls out all the chilling stops for the gloriously macabre climax. John Clifford's intriguing and enigmatic script astutely explores interesting issues pertaining to faith, life, mortality, and alienation. While Hilligoss carries the picture with her mesmerizing portrayal of the increasingly distraught, disconnected, and isolated Mary, she nonetheless receives sound support from Sidney Berger as smarmy and lecherous neighbor John Linden, Frances Feist as perky land lady Mrs. Thomas, Art Ellison as a hearty minister, and Stan Levitt as the compassionate Dr. Samuels. Harvey proves to be genuinely unnerving as the pasty-faced ghoul who constantly haunts and torments Mary. Kudos are also in order for Gene Moore's shivery pipe organ score and Maurice Prather's sumptuous black and white cinematography. Totally worthy of its sterling cult status.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just finished watching 'Carnvial of Souls' for the very first time and I've already made up my mind that it's an absolute masterpiece. This movie manages to be incredibly atmospheric on a shoestring budget of just a couple thousand dollars and achieves something that most of today's movies don't even manage on a multi- million dollar budget: To completely draw the viewer in and mesmerize them.This movie proves that you don't necessarily need tons of practical and special effects, big action sequences or an overly complex plot to make a good movie, but merely a group of dedicated people with a vision and the expertise to realize it. Herk Harvey, John Clifford, Candace Hilligoss and their colleagues probably didn't realize what exactly they were creating at the time, but they all had lots of talent and expertise as is evident in the final movie. It's a piece of art.The cinematography and direction of 'Carnival of Souls' are phenomenal, Gene Moore's organ score is haunting, and the acting is surprisingly captivating, especially Candace Hilligoss in the lead role. Her facial expressions in the scene where she's playing the organ as if possessed are chilling. The grand finale at Saltair is something that is burnt into my mind now. Such beautiful and haunting images. A brilliant movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On first viewing, CARNIVAL OF SOULS may well appear to be just another low-budget creep-fest from out of the black &amp; white past. However, those who have been intrigued enough to see it multiple times tend to see it as much, much more. In addition to some of the most fully realized nightmare images to ever haunt your dreams, there are underlying themes here that are remarkably profound: loneliness, isolation, obsession, religious faith... There are some heavyweight confrontations: What happens to us when we die? Is Christian faith the path to salvation -- or just a meaningless exercise in wish fulfillment? Is it free will that leads some individuals away from spiritual enlightenment or are some individuals just inexplicably doomed to an utterly soulless existence? I know of no other film that manages to deal as intelligently, intuitively, and viscerally with such serious ideas on this meager a budget. There are four key elements that make CARNIVAL OF SOULS a timeless mini-masterpiece: (1) the remarkably sophisticated ideas expressed in John Clifford's script, (2) the supremely ghoulish imagery conceived and realized by director Herk Harvey, (3) the truly compelling performance of Candace Hilligoss (the only paid professional actor in the film), and (4) Gene Moore's otherworldly organ score (reportedly composed in a single afternoon). To this day, CARNIVAL OF SOULS remains the only low- budget film on my list of all-time greats!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carnival of Souls is an interesting film. When Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) survives a car wreck in the water, she for whatever reason moves to Utah. She gets a job as a church organist, meets a creepy guy who lives in her apartment building, and does a lot of walking around. Specifically she goes to an abandoned carnival. Mary also has visions of a creepy looking man that kind of looks like Rudolf Klein-Rogge. I'm not quite sure why she has visions of this man or why she's drawn to the carnival. The film never explains. But it's atmospheric and even nerve racking at times. This was a difficult film to rate. Apart from the lack of explanation the film was still enjoyable to watch. The ending is very weird. It's almost as if it offers us three conclusions but none of them really add up. I'll have to watch this film a couple more times to determine this. Both David Lynch and George A Romero look at this film as an influence, which kind of tells you the kind of movie this is. If you like atmospheric horror films than Carnival of Souls is something you should check out.</fullReview>

But unfortunately, this drawing lots of its strength from a pre-established piece, it could never harvest all the credit that one could seem so inclined to giving it. But on its own, it's still a beautiful piece of cinema. The main actress is not only beautiful, she puts in a particular performance, subtly, alternating between a normal behavior for a young lady of the time and an uneasy, asocial, even pathological aspect of this complex character's identity. The film's meanings and aesthetics are expressed in a very artistic, always both very visual and musical strength, and it should be said that organ melody is very contagious and a courageous choice for how dissonant and evil-sounding it was for its time. All in all, a beautiful piece of modern romanticism, the individual against the world, a metaphor of the lonely soul longing for warmth but caged in an unfortunate destiny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak story, but visually interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't really know much CARNIVAL OF SOULS, other than that it was a low-budget horror movie with a cult fan-base. What I got was certainly interesting, but hardly a masterpiece. The story is probably the weakest element, as the characters don't really have any depth or personality, and the plot is paper-thin. It's still a compelling watch, though, due to the atmosphere created by a creepy organ score and some excellent cinematography. So, it succeeds as a mood-piece even while failing at the narrative level. The story is about a woman who survives a car wreck and then takes a job as a church organist in Utah. When she moves into town, she starts seeing a ghostly figure and is strangely drawn to an abandoned carnival. This basically sets the stage for a series of sequences where she hallucinates a lot and starts questioning her sanity, as do the people she encounters. There were also a few scenes which kind of tap into human fascination with religion and the supernatural. She sees herself as a rational person, only taking the organist position for the money, but the things she sees bring her into conflict with herself and others. Ultimately, though, the film is mostly about the creepy atmosphere and imagery, which are quite good. One scene I liked in particular took place in the church. She starts off playing out of her organ music book, but then transitions into carnival-esque music, almost as if in a trance. There was also a lot of good on-location shooting. For a film with such a low budget, it looked fairly decent. The only real complaint I have outside of the thin story was that the sound mix was muddled in places, making dialogue hard to hear. Ultimately, CARNIVAL OF SOULS, is an intriguing curiosity which, despite lacking in terms of story, has some cool visuals and a suitably unnerving score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Released in 1962, "Carnival of Souls" stars Candace Hilligoss as a young woman who survives a vehicle accident in Lawrence, Kansas, and then is troubled by a specter (director Herk Harvey) and other strange occurrences as she moves to the Great Salt Lake area for a gig as a church organist.This is an eerie, moody cult flick, but not scary at all. It's similar in vibe to 1961's "Night Tide" with Dennis Hopper. The creepiest part is the girl's lecherous neighbor in Utah (Sidney Berger). Besides the haunting ambiance, what I like best about it is the portrayal of two intersecting dimensions: Someone in the spiritual dimension can't be seen or (for the most part) heard in the physical realm. While it's overrated and predictable, it's still an interesting ghostly period piece.

		<shortDescription>Carnivals are rarely this eerie or shocking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carnival of Souls may not be a personal favourite or a masterpiece, but it is an incredibly effective film and was an inspiration for many film-makers.While Carnival of Souls generally doesn't look too bad, especially for the budget it had, there is an occasional crude and grainy look. The story is in places a little too thin and simple, with an abrupt ending with not much signs of a pay-off, and, with the exception of creepy Herk Harvey and especially touchingly vulnerable Candace Hilligoss (who allows one to completely identify with her even with just a telling glance), the acting is not that great with some of the minor players looking as if they weren't sure what to do with themselves.The setting is beautifully realised however, being both dream-like and appropriately nightmarish and there is some very inventive and atmospheric(like being part of a surreal dream) photography that is somewhat reminiscent of Val Lewton's style. The organ music is incredibly spooky, and doesn't feel overused or too intrusive at all, instead it adds to the atmosphere. The story may not feel like there is much to it, but it is elevated significantly by its atmosphere.Because where Carnival of Souls most succeeds is how it works amazingly as an atmosphere and mood piece. Throughout there is a genuinely eerie and nail-bitingly creepy quality, and as a shocker Carnival of Souls is legendary for a reason, the shocks delivered so unexpectedly and chillingly, with no signs of cheapness, in a way that few modern horrors today have managed to accomplish. It goes at a nice pace and doesn't ever feel dull, and Harvey's directing is credible, especially in how he managed to maintain such a great sense of mood and dread without being forced or cheap and there is some decent technical skill here. The characters are not the most well-developed but neither do they detract from the story either, heroine Mary is actually surprisingly easy to relate to.Overall, far from a flawless film, but even with its limitations still manages to be an eerily effective and entertaining film that still shocks today and has influenced many. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

So it's the atmospheric setting and the acting that make this standout from the usual schlocky horror film from the early 60's. There's a normal looking boarding house with a beautiful young woman and a creepy boarder looking at her through the crack in the door. It's the way the camera captures his single eye peering at her that makes him so creepy. Later as the 2 of them sit in a roadhouse, the dialog seems natural and realistic. The special effects were not terrific, but given the era, it would be surprising. Heads pop out of the river and their appearance never causes a change in the ripple pattern. Beginning Photoshop would have fixed that. It's a good movie for a rainy afternoon when you're sleepy and just sitting around.</fullReview>

The dialog is pretty stiff and she doesn't have great actors to play with. The directing shows a few moves but is generally tame. There is a moody atmosphere that is more distracting than disturbing. I do see some interesting elements of a horror in this but the movie is definitely not scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carnival of Souls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carnival of Souls is out there on all the horror movie packs that can be bought on box stores for cheap. The fact that it's so easy to view is tremendous because I feel Carnival of Souls is one of the greatest and influential horror films made. Giving a 9 rating, some of the other 1960's movie I also gave 9s to are Night of the Living Dead and Psycho, that itself tells how highly I think of this film. The beautiful lead actress Candace Hilligross played Mary Henry a soil survivor of a car crash. After the crash though, life turns into a terrible nightmare for Mary, she keeps seeing a deathly looking man that pops into life unexpectedly and also dips in and out of reality. She knows and the viewer knows quickly that the abandoned carnival land is the central focus to these problems. What makes Carnival of Souls so memorable is the very chilling creepy music that probably cracks the top five of bone shivering horror themes. Also, the makeup of the ghouls is spectacular and their scenes are so trippy when they do make an appearance. I recommend Herk Harvey's masterpiece, Carnival of Souls as a must watch to any horror fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave it a 5 because my feeling towards the movie is in fact a 50/50... I can't really decide whether I love it or hate it.Lets start by the positive things: - The dialog was clever and interesting. I specially liked the scene with the doctor (who, after all, wasn't a psychiatrist); - The story is interesting, it is a clich by now, but at the time the movie was made it wasn't.The negative: - The acting is absolutely atrocious, especially the one delivered by Candace Hilligoss. She exaggerates the facial expressions on the supposedly scary scenes, making it a comedy. And when she should, she has no expression at all. I haven't seen any other movie with her and I don't intend to, she is just awful; - You never get to understand what is really happening , OK we know from the beginning that she is dead (for the usual horror movie viewer, that is quite obvious). But what is that "carnival" after all? And what is her connection with that man that keeps "haunting" her? - The final scene, when they finally pick the car from the river it is clear that those women just stepped in the car after a shower and the director screamed "action"...awful, awful ending scene to a so-so movie.Anyway, i managed to see it all the way through but i won't recommend it to anyone as a cult classic, because it isn't, or at least it shouldn't be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eerie, atmospheric horror movie that mesmerizes you...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 1/2/2014 -- 7 out of 10(Dir-Herk Harvey) :screen title=Corridors of Evil(viewed 75 min re-issue): Eerie, atmospheric horror movie that mesmerizes you despite not a whole lot happening the first half of the movie. The movie uses lots of organ music, isolated sounds providing creepy anticipation to the viewer causing the willies before anything really happens. The story begins as a group of teenagers crash off a bridge during a car race into a river. The car sinks, disappears, then a woman emerges from the water appearing to be the only survivor. The woman, played by Candace Hilligoss, is recognized by the locals but begins being very un-approchable then decides to move away for an organist job in a church. When she arrives in the new town, she begins encountering visions and is drawn to an old abandoned carnival. Her boss, the preacher, warns her about entering the facility, but she does anyway and views many other visions and fades out into another realm during different parts of the movie where no-one can see or hear her. The viewer is entrenched in trying to figure out what's going on as the locals are in a similar funk about the new woman in town. This movie scares you without blood or gore and keeps you guessing up until the very end. It abruptly ends and you still have questions about what really happened. This is definitely not the best acted or edited movie with parts with obvious dubbing early in the movie that must have been done because of the lack of funds, but it does what it is supposed to do. It's kind of a psychedelic twilight zone-like movie that just lasts long enough to be a movie instead of a TV show. It is a unique find that you should watch if you are able due to the unique way that it creeps you out and scares you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic of Low Budget Filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) survives an accident that sends the car she's in crashing off a bridge. Afterwards, she takes a job as organist in a small town in Utah. While living at a boarding house there, she meets a flirty loser named John (Sidney Berger) and is haunted by visions of a ghostly man (Herk Harvey, also the director and producer).Low budget independent film from 1962 proves conclusively that you can make a good movie with hardly any budget to speak of. To be more precise, you can make an effective genre film that way, contrary to popular opinion. People tend to think the only movies you can make with a limited budget are pretentious art-house films about drug addicts or "pretty white people with problems." This is a unique, genuinely creepy film with a dreamlike atmosphere and some scares. It's a slow burn but worth it. Best when viewed at night in a dark room by yourself. Avoid spoilers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rated this movie a ten. Let's face it, it is a 60's movie probably considered a C flick in its best days, but this movie scared the living crap out of me as a kid and out of all the horror films I had ever seen to that point or since, Carnival of Souls was the one that kept me scared into my twenties.It movie helped develop a phobia I had for years where I was not able to look out of a window at night. I was so scared a white ghoulish face would appear and end me right there.I actually had to force myself to live in the Fox Theatre in San Diego and go down in the catacombs and into all the most bizarre scary places with my flashlight off at 1 or 2am in the morning looking for ghosts. I was there a few times when actors on stage said they saw ghosts in the theatre, but I never did and it was not for the lack of trying. I also slept overnight in the cemetery in Virgina City NV. Very well know for being haunted.I was terrified in the theatre and the cemetery, but by leaning into my fear I did get over my phobias and fears.All this because of this crazy good movie. I will love this movie for all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mary Henry is enjoying the day by riding around in a car with two friends. When challenged to a drag race, the women accept, but are forced off of a bridge. It appears that all are drowned, until Mary, quite some time later, amazingly emerges from the river. After recovering, Mary accepts a job in a new town as a church organist, only to be dogged by a mysterious phantom figure that seems to reside in an old run-down pavilion. It is here that Mary must confront the personal demons of her spiritual insouciance.This is the director's only feature film. He made a bunch of shorts but no features. And never went to Hollywood!It's a really oddball movie. When I was a kid and this was on TV it would scare the bejesus out of me, A lot of it is filmed silent and later has the sound dubbed in, adding to the strangeness.The organ music also adds to the movie's creep factor.Later in life, the director was bitter that this was the only thing he's be remembered for. At least he'll be remembered!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the emotionally dead die do they even notice?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carnival of Souls is an example of something that is pretty much gone from American cinema - a low budget horror film that manages to touch upon the very definition of horror. It really shares this honor with "Night of the Living Dead", also from the 60's. By this time the production code was dead, but the motion picture business wasn't yet so completely corporately controlled that a good low budget film didn't come out now and then, and this was one of them. This film dares to ponder the question - when the emotionally dead die, do they even notice?The film opens with a drag race - young guys versus girls. The girls' car goes off of a bridge into the river below. There is only one survivor, Mary Henry (Candace Hiligoss). Emotionally shaken - at least by Mary's standards - she is physically unharmed. Remembering nothing of the details of the accident, Mary decides to continue with her plans to move to Salt Lake City where she has a job waiting for her as a church organist. While on the trip west an eerie ghoulish face and figure, who looks a lot like Uncle Fester of the Addams Family, first appears out of nowhere and then disappears just as suddenly, and nobody seems able to see him except for her. Once in Salt Lake City, Mary takes a room in a boarding house down the hall from John (Sidney Berger). John very quickly - and somewhat desperately - tries to put the moves on her with all of the finesse of a pimply-faced high school sophomore. Mary sometimes rejects John, but sometimes welcomes his company mainly because the presence of other people seems to ward off the random appearances of the ghoulish figure. Mary is not the kind of person who needs people for companionship. Instead, unless they fulfill a concrete requirement like a car or a coffeemaker, she is largely indifferent to their presence. In John's case, his utility is that he is something that wards off the ghoul that stalks her.An odd fixation begins to overtake Mary - she is drawn to an abandoned carnival ground outside of town and begins to wonder about its contents and history. Also, one night when practicing on the church organ at her new job she begins to have visions of the ghoul that stalks her and of the carnival grounds. She begins to play wildly on the organ, incurring the wrath of the church's pastor and getting her fired from her job. Next, while walking through town, Mary suddenly becomes invisible and inaudible to all around her. That is, to all except the ghoul, who appears again. Probably most people today will figure out the ending pretty much from the beginning. However, in the case of this film, it is the journey not the destination that matters. This film does show that a good idea well executed, even on a low budget, can trump a well financed and slickly packaged modern film that is devoid of soul any day of the week. Who would have thought that a film that cost only 30K to make would have people talking philosophically about the dividing line between life and death over 40 years later? How many of the films made in the last five years that cost over 100 million to make will have the same effect on audiences 40 years from now? I doubt many if any will. Do avoid the cheap public domain copies out there and go straight for the Criterion release. It is worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very, VERY Eerie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Herk Harvey's low-budget Horror masterpiece "Carnival of Souls" of 1962 is, simply put, one of the eeriest, most haunting Horror films ever made. Sadly, the film's power is not always appreciated as it deserves to be. The film has a comparably slow pace, and therefore may not be the type of film that will appeal to everybody. Fact is, however, that "Carnival of Souls" is a film with an incomparably haunting, nightmarish atmosphere which it builds up brilliantly and uniquely. The film starts with an accident. The sole survivor is young Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss), a church organist. After the traumatic event, she feels mysteriously drawn to a deserted carnival... It is hard to give a proper description of this film's plot without spoiling it (which I do not intend to do). I'm not usually a fan of slow paces, but in the case of this one, the slow pace builds up an incomparably haunting, foreboding mood that keeps getting eerier with each passing minute. Leading actress Candace Hilligross does a magnificent job playing a traumatized, haunted role. The fear of loneliness is a central theme of the film, which often seems like a very eerie fever dream. The ingenious black and white cinematography and the brilliantly haunting organ music build up an enormously eerie mood that is capable of giving the viewer the creeps. "Carnival of Souls" is an enormously influential film, along with Ubaldo Ragona's 1964 masterpiece "The Last Man On Earth" (starring the great Vincent Price!) it was arguably the main inspiration for George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" (1968). Some people complain about this film's slow pace and even claim it is boring. Fact is however, that they are oh so mistaken - "Carnival of Souls" is a masterpiece and one of the eeriest films ever made, and it simply MUST be seen by all those who call themselves Horror fans. Haunting and absolutely sublime!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Different World of Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Herk Harvey and screenwriter John Clifford created one of the most fascinating and perhaps scariest movie, on a modest budget. Using a lot of shadows, derelict buildings, make-up, eerie music, odd noises and sometimes silence, and clever editing, he gave Carnival of Souls one of the most oppressive atmospheres ever, suggesting unspeakable horrors at every turn.The story starts with Mary Henry (Candice Hilligoss) falling in a river in a car accident. People start looking for the car and victims, without hope; but suddenly Mary comes out, traumatized. Time passes and she moves to a new town to work as a church organist. For her it's just a job, since she's not religious; people pay her to play, that's all. She's also indifferent about moving, since she doesn't feel close to people.But on her way to the new town she starts having visions of a man on white make-up. Suddenly he is everywhere she goes. And at times it seems she's blotted out of reality and people stop seeing her or listening to her (an amazing, eerie and cheap idea - I can't praise the filmmakers' resourcefulness in this movie).And somehow Mary feels it's all connected to a desolated pavilion outside the town, a sort of carnival or fair. She feels compelled to go there and it's there that the final, disturbing climax takes place. I find it worth saying this is the only movie to have scared me since I'm a child. I watch many horror movies and love the genre, but I'm insensitive to all the tactics really. But like The Shining, Harvey's movie has a quality that just fills one with dread.Unfortunately this movie is a few second too long and hits the viewer with a twist that isn't that twisty, but more of an overused clich. A clich which offers such a pointless explanation when ambiguity and uncertainty are so much better, and which I despise so much, I'll only give it a nine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biggest bang for the buck low-budget horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a real case of beginner's luck at making a horror movie. There have been other reviews and plot summaries so I won't go into that so much. What I want to discuss is the real weird puzzle of this film.The young woman is in the car accident where the car runs off a bridge and down into a river. Her two friends are trapped in the car but she manages to survive the crash and walks back out of the water. A few days later, she leaves town to take an organist job at a church some distance away. As someone else said, there is an overwhelming feeling that something just isn't right with her, and with all these people she encounters. Is she alive, and someone from 'the other side' is haunting her, maybe trying to reclaim her to where she should have been after the car crash? Or is she dead and somehow yet still among the living - and even she doesn't know it? You just can't be sure and that is what makes it so good. They don't spell this out - but once you start to understand the situation, it hooks you into how weird this all is.At times, for no apparent reason, the world around the young woman suddenly cannot see or hear her, and she cannot hear anyone but herself. While shopping, she goes into a fitting room to try on a dress; when she comes back out the clerk who has been assisting her cannot see or hear her. All sound is gone for some reason, yet the clerk is now helping another customer and they are conversing, so we know THEY can hear each other. The young woman flees the store to an outside world where men use jackhammers but not a sound is heard from them or anything else. Then, moments later, the young woman hears the chirping of a bird, and things seem to return to normal again. It is all strange and bizarre in unusual and novel and creepy ways. Another reviewer put it very well when he said that while there's not a lot of actual horror to the movie, what makes it great is the constant feeling that something is just 'wrong'. Even when the young woman isn't being stalked by the scary dead guy or suddenly seems invisible to the living world, most of the people she encounters have a slightly 'off' quality to them. You never feel at ease with any of them. Big buck horror movies with latex monsters dripping goo cost a lot more to make than this one did, but this one works and works well. A classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do not borrow to movies your own life and mind and soul?they must live by their own?if they have any. Do not help them. They must affirm, sustain themselves, with an inner, genuine life of their own. Concession and complicity undermine the mind.CARNIVAL is such a movie that lives by itself, it has autonomy. It looks like a study of mental illness ,and it follows and details the decomposition of a mind. We are allowed to see from the beginning that the central character, a youngish woman, is doomed, hopeless.CARNIVAL uses a psychological take, which makes it a drama, and only vaguely and exteriorly a genre movie, as it is usually labeled. It flirts with the '60 experimentalism and _psychologism,the use of more or less ingenious techniques for conveying the inner aspect of the psychic life, in its distortions and aberrations. (In this sense, CARNIVAL is more related to Polanski, than to Wise ?.)It is a small drama, well conducted, reasonably well played. Its theme is the mentally frail young woman, with a sexual neurosis underlying. The final denouement unmakes, yet, this pattern. It is quite moving on a hand as a rite of passing; on the other, as a purely psychological investigation of the victim's condition (the young woman's interaction with her temporary neighbor is the most interesting thing in the movie).The movie would have been better, to my mind, if it persevered as a psychological probing (like Polanski's much more fanciful, extravagant and even over?the?top film), then trading it off for a supernatural key to the story. The psychological aspect was much more achieved and deftly handed than the supernatural one. It was much more compelling as the story of a mentally frail, unstable young woman endangered and alienated, than as a ghost story. Up to the denouement, I hoped the solution will be a psychological, i.e. natural one.A rather respectable ,straightforward B movie, with some chilling, scary or at least impressing scenes (as opposed to the goofiness of flicks like BLOODY PIT OF HORROR,LADY FRANKENSTEIN,NIGHTMARE CASTLE?where, other merits notwithstanding, not one single moment was scary, or terrifying, or frightening).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>********* Carnival of Souls (1962) Herk Harvey ~ Candace Hilligoss, Herk Harvey, Sidney Berger, Frances Feist "A young woman apparently survives a drag race accident that had the car she was in toppling off of a bridge and into the river below. Unfazed by this experience, the woman heads off across country to her new job as a church organist. Experiencing strange things along her trip and also when she arrives at her new home, the woman begins to suspect the accident was not as it appears," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.Actually, Candace Hilligoss (as Mary Henry) appears unwashed, and somewhat slightly dazed, after the accident. Ms. Hilligoss is imaginatively guided through the atmospherically startling, but never gruesomely horrifying, "Carnival of Souls". Herk Harvey's film is a lesson in minimalist poetry. The director and photographer Maurice Prather give each scene a stark, simple beauty. Hilligoss' first visit to the ghostly pavilion cements the film as divine; it's one gorgeous shot after another. Some of the supporting players hit a sour note, but sleazy Sidney Berger (as Mr. Linden), and director Harvey (as Ghoul #1) are just right.A miraculously moody piece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The way the film start is really bizarre, i mean in less than 2 minutes you have a drag race and one car falling into a river. In that car was Mary and she was the unique alive; after that you see that Mary is an organist and that moves to a different church. Later she start having strange views of man and feel like she doesn't really exist.I really like the plot, that idea of going to the eternal rest without know is great, but me the best thing of this film is the atmosphere that it creates because it doesn't have lots of visual effects but still keeps you alert most of the time. And for the low budget ($30,000 estimated) is really well done. The cast is good, Candace Hilligoss (Mary) is just great and also very beautiful, and there are few roles so is just good the rest of the cast.This film was release in 1962 and it wasn't successful but now is a true cult film and really deserves a place in horror classics. 9/10DVD: i buy this DVD in single edition for $5 so it doesn't contains bonus material but i really love to collect this type of films.</fullReview>

At the age of 8 or nine, my brother and I would sneak down the stairs in the middle of the night to sit close to the glow of the B&amp;W TV set in the family room. The lights were off and the sound very low, because it was always after midnight when we saw Carnival of Souls. From the moment the organ music started to the ending credits we were clued to the carpet and writhering with chills from what we were watching. This film never left my mind as I grew up and the delight in seeing it as an adult is still as exciting as when I was a kid. Even with the many obvious flaws, this is a truly scary, great film that lives, in now as it did in the past. Thank you Herk and Candace</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Eeriest Little Movies Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George A. Romero was not the first industrial filmmaker to release a landmark B&amp;W horror picture in the 1960s. Romero, after churning out commercials for TV and those industrial films for Pennsylvania-based The Latent Image, came out with the seminal "Night of the Living Dead" in '68, but Herk Harvey had beaten him to the punch by a good six years. Harvey, in 1961, was working for Centron Films in Lawrence, Kansas, also cranking out industrial and educational films, before coming out with a film the following year, "Carnival of Souls," that has been chilling the blood of baby boomers and later generations for almost 50 years now. All Harvey needed, as the story goes, was one glimpse at the derelict Saltair pavilion near Salt Lake City (built in 1893, rebuilt in 1926, closed in 1958) to inspire his use of this site as the central locus for a horror movie. Writer John Clifford was given the task of coming up with some kind of a screenplay, $30,000 was raised, a cast of "no-names" was hired, and the film was shot in Lawrence and Saltair in just six weeks. Released in September 1962 on a double bill with the long-forgotten "Devil's Messenger," the film has since become a cult favorite, leading to a 1989 director's cut rerelease and a deluxe Criterion double-DVD package, loaded with a staggering roster of fascinating "extras."A seeming mash-up of Ambrose Bierce's famous short story from 1890, "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge," as well as the 1/22/60 episode of "The Twilight Zone," the one entitled "The Hitch-Hiker," the film introduces us to Mary Henry, a young woman who, when we first meet her, is involved in an automobile accident. The car in which she and two other young gals are passengers falls off a bridge and into a river. Three hours later, Mary emerges from the water, seemingly unhurt, and drives to another town to begin her new life as a church organist. But who is that ghoulish-looking man (played by Herk Harvey himself) who keeps following her? And why does she find herself slowly becoming invisible and inaudible to those around her? And finally, why does that ghostly pavilion by the lake seem to be drawing her to it?Mary, it must be mentioned here, is played by the one and only Candace Hilligoss, who became a cult figure herself by dint of this one film. Possessing an off-kilter kind of beauty and an alternately tentative and grating charm, Hilligoss is just perfect for this role of a woman who is losing contact with life and reality (although it must be said that Mary, antisocial and nonreligious as she is, only had half a contact to begin with!). What a shame that she only made one picture after this one, Del Tenney's excellent "Curse of the Living Corpse" (1963). I'm not saying that Candace deserved an Oscar for this film--1962 had a plethora of great female performances, including Bette Davis in "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?," Lee Remick in "The Days of Wine and Roses" and that year's winner, Anne Bancroft in "The Miracle Worker"--although I WILL say that her performance was at least as memorable as those other nominees'. In addition to her wonderful presence, "Carnival of Souls" also features another fine acting turn, by Sidney Berger as Mary's lecherous boardinghouse neighbor; a truly creepy score by Gene Moore (appropriately enough, all on organ); and some wonderfully effective B&amp;W cinematography by DOP Maurice Prather. This combination of inspired direction, perfect script, memorable acting, chilling music and gorgeous visuals has made "Carnival of Souls" well deserving of the appellation "The Movie That Wouldn't Die." It's been creeping this viewer out ever since he first saw it on NYC TV's "Supernatural Theatre" almost five decades ago, and continues to do so today. Those who have not experienced this low-budget wonder should pounce, and prepare themselves to witness one of the eeriest little movies ever made....</fullReview>

She's also drawn to this REALLY creepy abandoned bath house where the dead walk...and dance.I originally caught this on afternoon TV way back in the 1970s. It was a beautiful summer day out but I couldn't stop watching this. It had a real strong effect on me--I felt strange and uneasy for days afterwards. I also had nightmares about The Man who follows Mary around. It bombed when it came out in 1962 but it got an audience through constant showings on late night (and afternoon:)) TV. It was reissued in a beautiful new print in 1989. I remember catching it at a midnight showing...and being afraid of walking home alone! I just saw the Criterion DVD which came out in 2000. The print is just perfect and it still works on me. This is one VERY creepy film.It was made on next to no budget using mostly unknown actors who were all good. But the main "star" of this is the bath house. It was actually an abandoned dance hall. The place is downright chilling and director Harvey uses it to great effect. You constantly hear eerie organ music on the soundtrack when scenes take place there and the impressive cinematography really works on you. There's no blood, no gore, no violence...this works on you in a quiet way. Every time I watch it I get uneasy and scared. This isn't going to work for everybody but for me it's a true horror classic. I give it a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much organ music, but interesting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie appears to be a low budget thriller, but I also think there was some satire. For example, organized religion and tradition is seen as basically impotent to the power of the inevitability of mortality. A young woman is supposed to be dead from a car accident, but miraculously she appears to survive. Her adventures after the accident include basically alienating everyone by her cold and odd behave. When she plays the church organ to entrance the dead at the carnival, the priest accuses her of "sacrilege". Was this a rub against those who condemned rock for religious reasons? Secondly, the horny neighbor who wants to win her, is hysterically fun. He thinks that he is going to woo her, but he discovers that she is too lost in her own affairs. It was so funny when she went hysterical over dead souls she saw when he was in the room. He finally had had enough.Thirdly, the psychologist is portrayed with quiet humor. He is looking for every clinical reason to explain her condition. He makes rationalization and engages in wild speculation. The psychologist is really helpless in the face of her reality. Isn't this a poke at the mental health profession? Lastly, the ending shows the inevitability of death. She is half-dead, half-alive. She is visible to people, then suddenly people can't hear or see her. It reminds my of how people who are living, but at the same time are completely written off and marginalized. Existence in this World is always tenuous. However, inevitably she will have to join the dead. There is no escape from mortality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually started out seeing the remake first. I didn't even know it was a remake. And it was OK. I know most people (a lot of them have posted comments and reviews on this site) didn't like it. A lot of them compared it to the original, where as I had nothing to compare it to. And I still stand by it and say it's a good movie. Anyway, it wasn't until later that I found out that the original even existed and even later when I watched it. I bought the movie in a four movie collection and it was the third movie in the set. The set in question was the "AMC Monsterfest Collection: Cult Classics- Collection 1". For those who have read my previous reviews I will not go into much detail about the collection. Needless to say I was not too impressed with the AMC set thus far. So one night my girlfriend at the time went to bed and I was up late watching movies. Around 2 or 3 in the morning I decided I need to finish this DVD collection. So I put in "Carnival of Souls" and turned out the lights. And it turned out to be one of the best, and eerie, movies I ever saw. It was just the perfect setting to watch this movie. The film has a surreal quality and has a great story. This is a great example of how filmmakers with virtually no money can produce a great horror classic. Or at least a great horror cult classic. The Man is really creepy. He's the one who's following Mary everywhere. There is this one scene in which Mary sees these different ghost or ghouls dancing around and the Man emerges from the center of the group and slowly stalks towards the camera (Mary's point of view) and it is by far the creepiest part. That and there's a scene... no, I won't say any more. You just need to see this film. Trust me just watch it alone late at night with the lights out. On second thought maybe I'm over hyping it. If you go in with high expectations you'll be disappointed. So after you read this, read reviews from people who didn't like it. That way you take the good and you take the bad, you take them both and then you have... a nice balance of reviews. Then watch the movie. It ain't bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is an undeservedly forgotten horror movie. Director Herk Harvey is not a great name in the history of cinema, but he directed a solid couple of dozens of films, and this one, among his lasts has very good cinema moments.The story may seem quite routine today, we have seen it in many horror or psychological movies lately. A woman survives a car accident, her life changes, she feels she is followed by a zombie-like shadowy character, she cannot connect well with reality, and reality changes around her. All seems to be connected to an abandoned circus that complements reality with a dream dance of coming-from-dead characters. You may have guessed the line of plot already, but this may have sound real novelty at the beginning of the 60s.Acting is far from great here. The complex role of the woman is played by a completely unknown actress named Candace Hilligoss, she is OK, but not more, the rest of the cast is even more amateurish. the director could not probably afford more professional actors, yet he succeeds to create a really tense and dream-like atmosphere just by using his camera and superb organ music. An economy of means that is really to be admired in the times of the computer graphic effects and which proves that real thrill can be created out of nothing if the talent is there.</fullReview>

Hands down, for it's time, this film did so much that stands out amongst the rest in the horror genre, and I gaurantee that if you were to ask any of the big name horror films directors of today (Tobe Hooper, John Landis, Wes Craven, and especially George Romero) what their inspiration was to do what they do today, they would at least mention "Carnival of Souls" at some point. The horror films of today and even alot of the 80's and 70's fail to compare to the complexity and unique value that this film carries. God-forbid that it ever be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest cult films of all time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Title: CARNIVAL OF SOULS Rating (Original and Director's Cut): ****One of the perfect examples of independent filmmaking at its best. Made in 1962, on a modest budget of $13,000, and filmed in only three weeks, this film manages to make you chill in very much the same way NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD did six years later. The difference in the two I think lies in the fact that this film lies on a much more deeper, resonant level which actually makes you think while the latter goes for the throat in the terms of the horror and gore. This is one of those rare horror films that relies on atmosphere and suspense and succeeds on virtually every level, and despite the fact it had limited release and unheard of after a few years, by 1989 a demand for a re-release had come about after it had played quite a bit on late night television. Many of the original cast and crew were reunited and they probably had no clue how it had come about. In 2000, the highly respected Criterion corporation released a 2-disc DVD that is a true treasure for fans of the film and wonderful introduction to those that have never seen it....and I'm particulary talking to everyone who spent $300 on going to see THE SIXTH SENSE and make their own judgement as to how far director M. Night Shymalan borrowed from this to make SENSE his own. The story focuses on a beautiful young woman (Candice Hilligoss) who somehow surivives a drag-racing accident she had gotten into with some local friends. She is a church organist, who feels compelled to leave her hometown in Kansas (probably to leave this accident behind in her mind) and soon finds herself pursued by strange, white-faced "phantom figure" (played by director Herk Harvey). She also finds herself drawn to an abondoned Salt Lake City carnival by forces she can't comprehend, particularly when they make her lose touch with reality. The movie is relatively short; the original version clocks in at 78 minutes, and the Director's cut released in 1989 is five minutes longer, which adds mostly more shots of the zombielike creatures who terrorize her near the end and some more dialogue by Hilligoss with the doctor, and the friend who suggests a drag race at the beginning of the film. Still, the film stands out in the genre of horror films on many levels and should be studied by any person out there who wants to make horror or independent films. The performances are unifirmly superb starting with Hilligoss who plays her part as real as any other person would in her situation, trying to enjoy life and at the same time, figuring out where she is in terms of reality. Sidney Berger gives a wonderful performance as a guy who pursues Hilligoss in another manner; Roger Ebert described his character as being the pivotal example of a "nerd in lust." Even Hervey himself being an amateur actor has the right look and nuance as this ghoul who enters in to Hilligoss' life. As with NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and Roman Polanski's REPULSION (my personal fav in the horror genre) the film's shoestring production manages to bring it to life and manages to be an element of its brilliance rather than detracting from it and being looked as just amaterish. Recently, I put this film as one of the top 10 cult films of all time, the first being BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, if you are interested. Check out this genuninely creepy film and you shouldn't be disappointed.</fullReview>

If you say this, you probably haven't seen it. Yes, I and everyone that saw it knows: it's the most haunting film ever made. It's eerie, artsy, terrifying, and downright wonderful. Who can forget the 'Eastbound Bus' scene, of the 'Casting Out Devils" scene, or any scene in the whole darn movie. Watch It! It's better than The Evil Dead (1983), or Fiend Without A Face (1957), or Night Of The Living Dead (1968), and especially better than it's rip off The Sixth Sense.

		<fullReview>"Carnival of Souls" is about a woman who emerges from a very bad car accident alive. She is tormented with haunting images and an unusual longing to visit a mysterious long shut-down theme park. Soon realizes she is a sole survivor who is caught in between two worlds- the living and the dead. Extremely provocative- this film was once shunned off and finally reaching some of the attention it deserves (if you over-look the fact that it is still in the cheap $5.00 K-Mart Halloween Movie Specials section, and the fact that at one point it's name was unsuccessfully and stupidly changed to "Corridors of Evil", thankfully its now back to normal). "Carnival of Souls" is unique, with a end that is truely terrifying. Only hampered slightly by its lack of low budget. However its good to see that it doesn't have to take Special Effects to send genuine chills up your spine. But If only people could have really discovered this film sooner. Then just maybe we could have seen more of this style from the brilliant mind of "Carnival of Soul"'s director. WARNING: This movie only goes over truly well if you are an extreme open-minded Horror-buff... Otherwise its a toss-up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film did what few horror/supernatural movies have done to me and I have seen many of this genre. About 3/4 of the way through the film, I realized what was happening to the main character. I was not only surprised but actually horrified. I must have unconsciously identified with the character because, for a moment, it seemed as though it was happening to me. As in "The Sixth Sense", there are hints along the way that point to what is occurring, but they are subtle. The use of the abandoned Great Salt Lake dance pavilion added much to the film's unsettling mood or atmosphere. I can't recommend this film too highly.</fullReview>

Now that I have, I am glad to say that it is one of the most haunting and harrowing horror films I have ever seen. Made in 1962, I can see the influence that this film has had on future filmmakers, David Lynch and George Romero. The plot is well thought-out and the acting, while not professional, is quite realistic. The atmosphere is what make the movie great and very surreal. This made an enjoyment that I have not seen by any Hollywood movie. This movie is a lost gem, that is thankfully being rediscovered. I have to recommend this movie to all Film buffs and horror fan.

		<fullReview>Whether Herk Harvey ever watched Val Lewton's 40s horror classics, I can't say, but he certainly seems to have re-invented that producer's style for the TV generation. That this film was a one-off project by an industrial documentary maker makes it even more peculiar.As in Lewton's films, script and acting are both abysmal, so let us pay them no more attention. Again, as with Lewton, it's the atmosphere which distinguishes this work from other low-budget shockers. By the use of sustained shots, minimised lighting, sound (or lack of it) and the slightest make-up, Harvey manages to create a vision that is simply terrifying at the most fundamental level. We might quibble that the zombies are corny, or even that Hilligoss deserves what she gets, but these seem like details in the face of the remorseless chill.It's possible David Lynch may have seen this film in his youth - if so, you can see possible influences in the disjointed style, the inappropriate dialogue, the use of public buildings to hide sinister elements, aspects shared between his films and this one.In any event, I vastly prefer this film over Night of the Living Dead, which takes the same elements and removes most of the subtlety (in Carnival, we never actually see violence committed by the zombies). This film would never have won an award, but in its own limited genre it may be the best of its kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a confusing introduction that ended in 3 girls tragic death, the movie sets a tone of eeriness that I have not seen in modern movies. Throughout this no thrills movie it is the little things that keep you spooked, the organ sound track, the wide angle shots of no man's land Utah, a deserted carnival, and a truly scared looking actress. The terror portrayed by the lead actress is truly spooky, making you examine every little detail looking for clues on what is so scary. These facts alone make up for the problems with this movie - absence of a plot, humorous zombies, drunk obnoxious wannabe boyfriend, stealth shoes through the depot, and a pointless bathtub scene. What amazed me most was I was still spooked after a very disappointing ending and most horror/intrigue movies fail miserably at leaving me even a little unnerved. I highly recommend watching this movie to pick out the things besides a plot that can leave you truly scared.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mary, fresh from a car wreck that kills her friends, leaves her Kansas home, where apparently they are fresh-out of opportunities for an up-and-coming church organist, and drives across the country to take a church job in the big city (Utah). hmmm...! um, OK... sure. From there the story advances in the Scooby-Doo direction, with the appearance of an abandoned carnival. This is the kind of movie that would be be dispensed by a script-writing machine after supplying a few ready-to-shoot locations (a carnival, the Reuter organ factory) discovered by an industrial training-film director.Like all recent entries in the now very-dead "scary movie" genre, it makes the cosmically bad choice to develop a system of horror motifs than to consider and portray anything that actually scares people. The "art" tramples everything else. Many standard, outdated movie conventions are here; choking the life out of things but providing much of the hilarity. Mary's Wiggle-the-Steering-Wheel driving is pretty funny. Convoluted exposition comes from the mouths of unintroduced characters who shouldn't know all the stuff they do. The middle corpse blinks her eye in the final scene. If films were only about hiring a cutie and getting the compositions in focus you'd have something here. The movie has no internal logic as to what scares Mary (a man with eye makeup) and what doesn't (a mattress coming down a carnival slide by itself). Every actor tries to lend eerieness to the proceedings, but instead comes off as a total perv. A ghoul ends up less scary than the assortment of lecherous creeps Mary encounters. The simplest take on this movie is that Mary is shooting heroin to escape a culture of rapacious men. Watch for the giant sweat stains after her date!!!I suspect the longevity of this movie is related to the casting of Mary. The actress is only as good as her bad director but there's just no way to light or shoot her wrong. She has some kind of near-superstar facial structure. Many fans must have been initially roped in by her features.The chirpy mid western amateur actors are either a hoot or the moralizing dead-weight of this movie. Living in Kansas in the 1962 can't be much different than living with zombies. Adding to the wealth of kitsch is the torpid, square "making of" feature on the Criterion collection DVD. The inter-cut phony reaction shots are a riot. Both would make a perfect thesis topic for the unshakable viewpoint that there actually is a correct, "normal" way to do things in Kansas (in the 60s AND in the 90s).This is comically outdated stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Acting And Weak Character Development Are Significant Problems In A Decent Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story behind this movie wasn't bad, but to be honest it would have benefited greatly from some better acting and character development. I sometimes rail against the tendency of some movies to overdo character development at the expense of story, but here one of the things that put me off from the beginning was the rather sudden move right into the story. With no introduction to the characters - we don't even know the name of the main character - we're thrown right into the story, as a car driven by three girls goes off a bridge and into the river. Once she emerges from the water - to the surprise of everyone - we discover that the main character's name is Mary Henry, and it's her that we follow, although we never really learn much about her except that she's an accomplished organist. Mary was played by an actress named Candace Hilligoss in what I thought was a forgettable performance. I never got much sense of emotion from her, and the emotion the movie did try to portray seemed to me to be forced. In a movie that featured mostly underwhelming and forgettable performances, the "best" was probably from Sidney Berger as Mary's somewhat lecherous neighbour John Linden, and - because I thought his performance was passable, it's not surprising to me that I found Hilligoss's best scenes were probably those she shot with him.In addition to poor performances, there were a couple of points I thought were just poorly done. One is a technical point: as Mary plays the organ, the problem is that the music being played doesn't at all match what she's playing if you watch her hands on the keyboard. In fact, it isn't even close. And I thought it rather strange that Dr. Samuels (Stan Levitt) would take Mary back to his office and spend an hour - according to her - in what seemed to be some sort of psycho-therapy, only to then say to her "well, I'm no psychiatrist." As I said, the story is not bad. I had kind of figured out what was happening early on, but there was a fair enough feeling of "creepiness" that's important for this kind of movie. I would have appreciated knowing why the carnival was so important that Mary feels drawn to it long before she arrives in Utah from wherever she started out (I don't remember her starting point being identified.) That was a significant weakness to me. The plot (of a soul caught somewhere between life and death) was OK, but the mystery of the carnival's attraction was never resolved.The weak acting put me off this one, I have to admit. Some apparently see it as a cult classic, but it doesn't make that grade for me. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before there was "The Sixth Sense", before there was "The Blair Witch Project", there was the one, the only, "Carnival of Souls". Educational filmmaker Herk Harvey decided to make an Ingrid Bergman-influenced horror film... in Manhattan, Kansas of all places. Like "The Blair Witch Project", Carnival of Souls has almost no budget ($33,000) and utilizes the viewer's imagination to fill in the unseen, spooky details in lieu of pricey special effects. "Souls"' zombies greatly influenced George Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" (1968), and Souls' twist ending is the inspiration for M. Night Shyamalan's "The Sixth Sense". In a recent edition of Entertainment Weekly, horrormeister Stephen King singles out Carnival of Souls as one of five movies that are scary precisely because they have low budgets.Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) is the sole survivor of a car that drove off a bridge into a river. She travels to Utah to start her new job as a church organist, but before she reaches her destination she's drawn to an abandoned carnival pavilion in the middle of nowhere. Mary is very asocial and high strung, and after a while she starts freaking out when she keeps seeing a ghoulish man (Herk Harvey) and experiences bouts of being invisible to everyone around her. A psychiatrist tries to help her, but her hysteria builds until she is driven to the old pavilion, where a ballroom full of dancing ghouls start chasing her.I'm just amazed by how effectively haunting, memorable, and unique this low-budget film is. Herk Harvey and his crew overachieved and created a film with a lot of mystique. Candace Hilligoss is mesmerizing. She's in every scene, and her ethereal beauty perfectly matches Mary's sense of aloofness in relation to the small-town locals around her. Francis Feist makes an impression as Mary's boarding house landlady, and Sidney Berger is wonderfully sleazy as Mary's creepy lothario of a housemate. Herk Harvey has a great look and presence as the chief ghoul hounding Mary's soul. Maurice Prather's cinematography and Gene Moore's organ-tastic soundtrack help create tremendously spooky atmosphere.Psychological and existential themes aren't explicitly addressed, but they're at work at a deeper level, inducing some serious musings about identity and existence. Mary is a church organist, but she only considers it a job and wants nothing to do with the religious aspects of the position. Are ghouls hounding her because she has no faith in God and is irreligious? Or is "Carnival of Souls" a morality play? Mary is depicted as asocial, becoming uncomfortable when other people get too close to her. Are the undead hounding her because she isn't really living in the world without meaningfully engaging with other human beings?A divine triumvirate of '60s Ice Queen/female hysterical horror: Candace Hilligoss in "Carnival of Souls", Judith O'Dea in "Night of the Living Dead", and Catherine Deneuve in Roman Polanski's "Repulsion". "Repulsion" is psychological horror without any supernatural elements, but Deneuve's horrific meltdown has the most dramatic development of the three films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having graduated from BYU in 1973, I'm familiar with the outdoor setting for much of this flick. Used to drive out to the Salt Palace on the Great Salt Lake &amp; look around.It is an isolated, spooky area in the Great Salt Lake Valley. Seeing the shots of Salt Lake City and trying to figure out where the film is shooting is-a-kick.A life-long fan of sci-fi &amp; horror movies, I prefer these older black &amp; white films to today's unimaginative, show-me-everything slasher movies. They almost border on the hysterically funny.Although this film isn't a classic, it makes you think about life, death, sanity, insanity, etc. As a print journalist of 35+ yrs. (17 with Billboard Magazine in L.A., Vegas &amp; Bflo/Rochester markets, I've also worked for two major PR firms in L.A. Check out: "The Day The Earth Stood Still," "Forbidden Planet" &amp; "Pscho" to see what I mean. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only in America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films like this only happen in America. We invented the art form &amp; we feel it in our bones. Germany, Sweden, France, Italy make a film like this; sweat, cry, rend their shirts &amp; ruminate for years. In America we make them on vacation, all out do or die, get screwed by the lab &amp; a cheesy distributor &amp; true genius vanishes without a ripple. That's the breaks in America; no other country ever was or ever will come close. I agree with the others mostly. It is not a Twilight Zone it is a complete film. On a par with the best European art films. The eerie atmosphere reminded me of Cocteau's Orpheus. Watch it if you liked this film. It is, of course, a much greater film (Orpheus that is) but Orpheus is the mature work of a realized genius with all the resources. Maybe I imagined this but the director pulled a truly brilliant stunt in keeping the star confused (because that was perfect for her character) &amp; simultaneously playing the lead zombie himself (her nemesis). It makes a neat little in comment on film-making itself. Worthy of Hitchcock. A stillborn Romero at least. Let's hope that the new Digital Video &amp; the massive home video market put a stop to us losing talent like this ever again.The girl, Candice Hilligoss, carried the film &amp; kept you from noticing the flaws in some of the other performances. The Guy, Sydney Berger, seems over the top today but guys were supposed to be aggressive like him in that era.The only big technical beef I have is the car wreck. I know they could only push it over once but they should have had the guts to jerk it through the railing HARD with some aircraft cable. The gag doesn't sell. A crash camera in the car was also badly needed. Oh well. A nifty quick cut little sequence here or even a roll over of the camera would have stood the audience up at just the right time. I wish I knew how they got the ripple effect when she crosses into the dead world. I think it's in camera &amp; it's real good, subtle too. More of a ghost story than a pure horror film. I think why the film is so disturbing is that in the end we are all running from death &amp; Like her we are all born to lose that race.</fullReview>

Campy at times, unsettling at others, Carnival of Souls is nonetheless entertaining and imaginative. This moovie is a classis example of cow a good story can not only survive low-budget productions, it can thrive because of it - think Blair Witch Project. Creepy organ score underlines the overall broody, macabre atmosphere. Director Herk Harvey imbues the film with sublety and suspense, and also plays the grinning, pursuing "man". Most of the cast and crew don't seem to have worked in the business again, which is rather unfortunate, although Candace Hilligoss does appear in '64's Curse of the Living Corpse.

		<shortDescription>A dreary 'cult classic'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carnival Of Soul's narrative style is very similar to many episodes of Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone: an atmospheric, supernatural tale with a macabre twist at the end. And, just as that show struggled to maintain its effectiveness beyond its original half-hour format, so this film outstays its welcome once it passes the thirty minute mark.It doesn't help much that, since its original release, Carnival Of Soul's basic premise has been done to death (pun intended) in such films as The Others, Dead End, The Sixth Sense, and Jacob's Ladder, but even taking this fact into consideration, the film's lifeless pacing (pun intended again) and constant, dreary, funereal organ score makes this a very dull watch indeed.A box-office failure on its original release in 1962, the film resurfaced in 1989 (which was when I first got to see it) and has since become a 'cult classic'; as far as I am concerned, the viewers got it right the first time around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An ultra-cheap B-horror movie, filmed in Lawrence, Kansas, in 1962, with a really creepy Twilight Zone-style premise and some great shoestring atmosphere. Wandering into a small town after an auto accident, to begin her new job as a church organist, young Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) begins to pick up strange vibes: none of the normal people in town seem to be able to see her, and she keeps being accosted by freakish pasty-faced types who seem to be dead on their feet. The nightmarish finale benefits from its one-of-a-kind "found" setting, an empty amusement park rising like a ghostly castle from the prairie landscape. This is much less aggressive and violent film than George Romero's original Night of the Living Dead, but for sheer skin- crawling spookiness, it's in the same class.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before you are going to shoot me down, oh yes I know that there were zombie flicks before this one and yes, they aren't really zombies more living souls BUT if you look at their make up then you will compare that with the popular Night Of The Living Dead, made 7 years later. I will say it again, I'm not a fan of the 50's and 60's horror flicks, something is missing in that era, although some great ones were made then, anyhow, the storyline is okay and the acting is okay but it surely lacks on the amount of blood, to be honest, there isn't any. No gore, no nudity, but now and then there pop ups a creepy face. And it is those faces that make the movie. The effects are from the easiest part, there are none, they are just acted effects but it works. Of course the movie is slow but wait until the end when the lost souls are hunting their victim. It's something between acting and dancing. Worth watching and made just before the first slasher ever, Blood Feast. Guess what it would be if it was made afterwards, any way, enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad movie that's mysteriously appealing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie may well be a cult classic, as another comment suggested. I don't know that, as I just happened to get a copy and watched it. The acting is some of the worst I've ever seen -- very amateurish and outlandishly inappropriate. The story is presented in a sort of confused, intentionally "strange" way, with people acting in unlikely ways just to further the story. At the end, we do "get it," but it's basically a campfire "scary" story expanded to about an hour in the telling. Still, with all its bad acting, bad writing, bad directing, bad music, it does have something interesting about it, a sort of jerky momentum that keeps you watching. (It's also interesting as a period piece, as there are cars, street scenes, etc. from the very early sixties.) In the end, any disappointment you may feel about the "resolution" of the story is sort of mitigated by a sense of your having had a whole experience. I actually thought "Hmmm, I might watch that again sometime," but it wouldn't be to try and get anything more out of it than I did the first time; it would just be to experience the strangeness again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I figured I knew the ending to this one before I watched it, but as I watched it I figured I might be wrong. In fact, I was not sure where the movie was going and that was one of its best aspects. Then in the end what I figured before I watched it comes to be, but it doesn't make much sense to me in some ways. This one has a girl who is the sole survivor of an awful car crash. She makes it through and ends up getting a job in some church in Utah. She goes there and strange things start to happen as she is stalked by this strange man, though is he really there at all or maybe he is a ghost. She also is seemingly drawn to this closed down carnival. Things go okay at first, but then she has episodes where people seem not to be able to hear or see her. She gets fired from the church and everything seems to lead back to the carnival, but then the ending comes and you are left wondering what the carnival really had to do with anything. Also why did the strange man and the others have such hostility to the girl? She was not aware of what was going on. On the whole though, I found this movie to be rather entertaining. The scene where the people come out of the water and start chasing the girl are very well done and surprisingly chilling and effective. I just wish I could get what happened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's be honest here...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carnival of Souls is an interesting low-budget movie, but it's hardly the masterpiece some people make it out to be. The technical quality, direction, and editing are so bad that they nearly overwhelm whatever good elements are present--those good elements primarily being the occasional evocative image (the dancers!) and the eerie quality of the acting of Ms. Hilgloss.Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed the movie, but after reading about it for years and looking forward to seeing it for so long, I found it overrated for what it actually turned out to be. Even for a budget (I read) of $17,000, the crew could have done a much better job of editing the shots they got. I really wanted and expected to like this better than I did, because I'm prejudiced in favor of strange, cheap little movies.(MINOR SPOILERS)I find it hard to believe that anyone would actually be surprised by the ending, but just in case.... It was at best a homage and at worst a ripoff of Bierce's famous short story "Incident at Owl Creek Bridge," though I'll admit not exactly parallel.One of the discussions the movie provoked between my girlfriend and me was how much the main character's attitudes and emotions were shaped by the fact that she was dead. Put bluntly: Was her attitude that being a church organist was "just a job" a reflection of being dead, and was that an attempt by the writer and director to make a moral point? On the other hand, she also didn't enjoy music, dancing, or beer, or even human company, so maybe it had more to do with the death of human emotion in general. In any case, it was hardly subtle.I would recommend that any film fan see this movie, but understand that it represents something like cheesy rock 'n' roll music of the time: a precursor of something better and more sophisticated to come.</fullReview>

A beautiful college graduate, who majored in organ music, plunges into a river with two other girl friends during a horrible auto accident. While local authorities are searching the river, she comes to the surface in a daze. She leaves for a new job in a Salt Lake City church. Outside of the town is an abandoned carnival that has a special hold on her mind. She has recurring visions of a white faced man who looks like Grandpa from the Munsters. She spends one night in a boarding house with an old woman and a persistent lecher. The constant organ music used as a sound track is almost as annoying as bagpipe music. Good thing this is not a long movie. I do appreciate that this was an attempt at good horror.</fullReview>

The characters are all completely unlikeable which is my biggest gripe by far, the main character is intended to be seen as a little bit off key however she is just awful, there is nothing that makes you feel sorry for her or want her problems throughout the film be resolved. The idea of the film is good but its also done poorly, why would she be drawn to a spot she has never been when shes already dead? Who is the main ghoul? Why on earth would three girls have a drag race in the 50's. All and all I found the film to be very poor and I don't understand why it gets such a positive response. HOWEVER, the film uses a large variety of locations and the music is terrific which makes the movie bearable if only just. 3/10.</fullReview>

And I'm not one who is usually unable to appreciate an artsy type of classy film-making.I don't find the main character interesting, nor do I care about the nonsense she engages in during the course of this groaner - talking to anyone who'll listen, gaining a position as organ player for the church, etc... who cares? What saves this from total ruin are some crumbs to be salvaged with some style and unnatural creepiness. Maybe that's the point I'm missing. If so, it isn't enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was rather surprised to see the IMDb overall rating of 7.0 for "Carnival of Souls" at the time of my posting; the film for me straddles the line between pretentious and artsy. The lone survivor of a car driven off a bridge wanders out of the river in shock, only to be viewed in the next scene preparing to take a job as a church organist in another town. It doesn't get much more surreal than that. It's rather amusing to see the sheriff's department scouring the river for the submerged car, various folks commenting on the river's swift progress and how the muddy waters may make it impossible to ever retrieve the vehicle. The scene closes with a rather good view of the underwater vehicle, with the lights on no less. At various points in the film, Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) crosses over into a nether world where no one can see or hear her. She is menaced by the repeated sighting of a ghoulish apparition, but there doesn't seem to be any meaning attached to this particular character. At a certain point, he becomes the ring leader of a nightmarish cast of characters dancing the night away in a deserted pavilion on the edge of town, thereby at least lending credibility to the name of the film.Mary's boarding house neighbor across the hall John Linden (Sidney Berger), plays his character with all the lusty alcohol induced stupor the part calls for, and then wonders why he can't seem to score with the church lady. The relationship though does set the stage for the single genuinely humorous exchange of the film -Mary: (as John loads up his cup of Joe with a shot of alcohol) "What's the matter, can you still taste the coffee?" John: "Come on, whaddya think I'm an alcoholic. Look, I just like to start the day off in a good mood, that's all." Mary: "You must be hilarious by noon."Mary's nether world becomes too much to bear, the crossover between nightmare and reality blending together to such degree that she can no longer discern one from the other. It's at this point that Mary begins to plead for all this to be over; this viewer at least was ready to take her up on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carnival of Souls, 1962 First off I want to say that I owe this movie a lot. This movie along with "Night of the Living Dead" and "The Last Man on Earth" helped to create what would later be known as the Zombie genre of horror movies. Thus I thought it would be good to see this movie. The problem, which I freely admit is not this movies fault, is that because it was creating the zombie genre, it didn't really have to try to do anything big. It just showed us some zombie-like creatures, put them in a vaugly creepy setting, and figured that would be enough. And if this was the first zombie movie I had ever seen, it probably would have been. The problem is, everything in this movie, I have seen in at least 3-4 other movies. Now, while perhaps that isn't fair since this movie was made before them, it still made the movie impossible to enjoy. Also, the acting was just plain terrible.3/10, 4th out of 4 movies for 1962, 32nd* of the 1960s, 1088th of all time. *just so you know that's 32 out of 32 movies for the 1960s, I know, I really need to see some more old movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carnival of Souls starts with two cars racing each other three lads in one &amp; three girls in the other, it's probably an ego thing. Being a typical woman driver their car ends up over the side of a bridge &amp; into a river. As rescuers try to find the wreckage &amp; bodies one of the women Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) stumbles ashore, wet &amp; shaken but seemingly in good physical condition. Both of her friends (Sharon Scoville &amp; Mary Ann Haris) are considered dead. Mary carries on with her life as nothing had happened &amp; moves to Utah when she has been offered a job in a local Church as an organist. Mary finds a boarding house run by an elderly lady named Mrs. Thomas (Frances Feist) &amp; tries to settle in. However Mary keeps seeing the recurring image of a ghostly figure, a man (an uncredited Herk Harvey). Mary starts to find the line between fantasy &amp; reality blurring as not only does she keep seeing this man but while out shopping it seems as if she ceases to exist. Mary talks with Dr. Samuels (Stan Levitt) who retraces these strange occurrences back to when she passed a spooky derelict run-down pavilion on the outskirts of town...Produced &amp; directed by Herk Harvey who also happens to play the main ghost in the film I have heard nothing but positive things regarding Carnival of Souls but to be brutally honest I found it to be dull, boring &amp; lacking any of this so-called atmosphere, eeriness or creepiness that it's supposedly famed for. The script by John Clifford has a lot of potential &amp; a good central idea but he populates it with uninteresting &amp; bland characters. I found it dragged &amp; simply did not captivate me or maintain my fast waining interest over the course of it's 80 odd minute duration. The opening scenes are good &amp; hooked me but once Mary gets to Utah &amp; Carnival of Souls settles into boring melodrama occasionally punctuated by a ghost it's a chore to sit through. There are one or two decent sequences here mostly revolving around the derelict pavilion which stop Carnival of Souls from getting 1 star but their few &amp; far between. The ending leaves things open for the viewer to make sense of what they have just seen &amp; this is one part of Carnival of Souls which works well. Technically the film is better than you might expect &amp; is quite well made throughout. I found the constant Church organ music very annoying by the end. Hilligoss puts in a very good performance but no one else particularly distinguish themselves. Apparently filmed on a budget of about $30,000 &amp; shot in three weeks this black and white film laid in obscurity because of a bad distribution deal until as recently as 1989 when it got a brief theatrical run, apparently anyway. Carnival of Souls didn't do much for me, all this hidden meaning of the imagery is down to personal interpretation &amp; I interpreted it as being boring. I'm sorry if I've upset or offended anyone here because more or less everyone seems to enthuse about it but films are all about personal opinion &amp; mine is that I simply didn't like it. Carnival of Souls in neither a film I ever want to see again or could recommend to anyone.</fullReview>

Of the positive things I had read, "eerily filmed" and "fascinating" appealed to me most. I found neither. Did I expect too much?How a film this slow moving could be a cult favorite with today's audiences is beyond me. I don't believe it's true. I did appreciate some of the photography but the story dragged in so many spots that it took any enjoyment away from any good visuals. One of the reasons the secular-dominated critics might have liked this was that the main character went to work as a church organist, but was not a Believer. I'm sure that part resonated with them. Otherwise, what's to like in this film? I'm sorry, but this is way overrated.</fullReview>

It takes up an air of its own making all other aspects obsolete regardless of its storyline or unknownst characters..whatever those might be. This type of film is to be seen entirely for its atmosphere and liked for compassion to its familiarity not for being an enjoyable movie. The type of movie to watch at a clear, quiet 3 am in late autumn with your girlfriend whilst in a dreamlike open minded stupor with peaceful paranormal thoughts of past times crossing the depths of your mind and quiet Indian spacemusic playing in the background.

She has rubber legs -- look how she sails over the pedal board as if she were just hitting random notes.5. Finally, she does the UNTHINKABLE. She plays without shoes! In all fairness, though, they do reappear on her feet when she leaves the console.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Carnival of Souls" is such a blank, you can't even get angry at it. It's too technically imaginative (on a low budget) to be passed over, yet it isn't anything worth savoring--and when film-buffs speak of what a masterpiece it is, I think what a masterpiece it might've been with more proficiency. Still, there's enough atmosphere in it to create a curious scenario, and its non-star (Candace Hilligoss) is just vapid enough in a mannequin-like way to be convincing. She's a professional organist who survives a car accident off a bridge; after leaving town to accept a job in a church, she finds spirits dogging her in what seems to be a perpetual dream state. Director Herk Harvey tries out some semi-fancy visual tricks that either enhance the overall mood or turn the movie into a camp-fest (depending on your perceptions), though only his smaller accouterments tend to stay in the memory. Some eerie shots, such as a spooky reflection in the river, might just have been accidental (pick-up shots); if they were not, then Harvey genuinely did possess a perceptive eye. The constant organ music becomes wearisome, as does a sub-plot involving Hilligoss with a horny guy who works in a warehouse. Overall, the picture just doesn't have enough meat on its bones to sustain an entire feature. Harvey's pacing dawdles, and he has no moments that pack an honest punch, so that his mild film raises more irritation than thrills. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carnival of Souls is the kind of title for a movie that really makes you want it to be scary. It's such a good name, especially for this genre, but this version has lost most if not all of its effectiveness since its release in 1962. The story is about a girl who manages to survive a car crash, and subsequently cuts herself off from other people, taking a job as an organ player at a church, but just as a way to make money. She begins to have creepy visions of a dead looking man who constantly shows up at strange times, and eventually seems to be following her.While the main character, Candace Hilligoss, is surprisingly attractive, the entire film is full of bad acting and even worse script writing. She meets a guy in the home where she is renting a room, and although he is overly insistent, he is always polite to her. Then when she eventually agrees to go out on a date with him, he almost immediately turns into a complete b*****d. Why would he go to all of that effort to persuade her to spend time with him, and then treat her like crap? The ghostly visions that she has, in particular, have lost all of their effect. Toward the end of the film, not only does she see dozens of these zombies following her, but she also sees herself as one, which hints to the possibility that this movie might have some meaning beyond just a goofy ghost story. However, probably the main reason that this movie isn't scary is that a lot of the scenes weren't edited very well. There's a scene when Mary (Hilligoss) is running from dozens of the zombies, and you can clearly see a huge grin on her face, as if the zombies were a huge group of children who were trying to tickle her.While Carnival of Souls does have a few fairly creepy moments, the film as a whole is a disappointment. The black and white photography is probably one of the best elements of the film, and it does have an interesting soundtrack, but the movie almost entirely lost its impact over the years.And the obscure and confusing ending didn't help much either?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.If you wish to see this, I recommend the Criterion DVD. It has a half-hour report on the 1989 rerelease, done by local TV about their nearby cult celebrities. It really helps to see these guys and understand where they are coming from before you see the film.If you must see the film the ordinary way, watch the shorter version. But it is much better I think to completely turn the sound off and watch the images of the longer version. That's because the score (a vapid skating organ) and acting are amateurish. The story, as with most horror, is trivial.But Herk really knew his camera, or at least some elements of it. The camera positioning is mostly fixed, sometimes handheld. There's no magic in the motion. There's no rhythm in the editing. But some of the framing and lighting is technically brilliant, especially at the end in the abandoned resort where something extraordinary happens to his images.This is no ordinary goof. These are Kansans from the 50's. There is no irony here whatsoever. There's something frightening about the idea of Cornbelt Methodists bringing life to the profane through some technical brilliance. This scares not because of what it is, but where it came from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So-so chiller thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Painfully predictable spook film about a young woman who keeps having weird glimpses of stalking corpses. The acting was pretty bad, the plot was warmed over been there-done that, and the make-up looked exactly like what it was. It did have some creepy spots, but overall it was a loser picture.</fullReview>
