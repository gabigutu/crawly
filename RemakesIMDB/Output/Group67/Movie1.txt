		<fullReview>Oh well, It was bound to happen. I finally saw the remake of Carnival of Souls. Was it worth it? In a word, NO! Forget the original set up about the lone survivor (Candace Hilligross) of an automobile accident, moving to a small town, and seeing visions of ghoulish people from the other side coming for her. This time around, A young woman (Bobbie Phillips), a victim of sexual abuse by a pedophile clown (comic Larry Miller) when she was younger, encounters the clown years later. He forces her to drive to the river and she deliberately crashes her car into the river.......you know the rest.This movie is so terrible. It plays like a dirty USA made for TV movies of the week. The acting is similar to anything you would encounter while watching Melrose Place, etc. Wait til you get a load of what the people from the other side look like this time around. Whooo-boy. No expense was spared for the make up effects for these creatures.I can just imagine the congratulatory slap on the backs the film makers received from each other. These bums probably think the remake of Psycho was better than the original. I think the audience for this movie is for those who think Urban legend, I Know What You Did This and Last Summer, etc. are great classics. I hope those "12 year old of all ages" enjoy the film. I sure as Hell didn'tI read a few months back, that Candace Hilligross was supposed to have a hand with the remake, but those around the making of the film back stabbed her off the production. I hope she has the last laugh when she sees the critical raspberries this film will rightfully receive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The pits! God knows why Wes Craven insists on slapping his name on the front of drivel like this, it's only going to ruin his reputation.I've not seen the first film that this was based on so I can't compare them.(please someone do the honors &amp; tear this film to pieces)Far too many prolonged dream sequences got me reaching for the fast forward button, characters you don't really care about, gorehounds will hate it &amp; a naff ending just about sums this film up. one out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A complete waste of time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is perhaps the worst movie I have seen in my entire life, and I have seen some really bad films. This movie was extremely boring, had zero plot, and no decent acting to speak of. The limited special effects are nothing noteworthy, either. I had a hard time staying awake, and when it was over, I wished I had fallen asleep instead of subjecting myself to such torture. I can't believe that Wes Craven would put his name on such a dismal failure. If you were thinking of watching this film, don't waste your time or money. Rent something better, such as the original Carnival of Souls (1962).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting film...marketed COMPLETELY WRONG!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I completely understand why so many people did not get what they expected from this film. It WAS NOT what you would expect seeing WES CRAVEN's name and with the "horror" marketing.I actually liked this film and agree with those that call it a "psychological thriller". That's EXACTLY what it is. Very understated. It deals with the mind set of Alex (Bobbie Phillips) and her coming to terms with a traumatic childhood. It is not a teen horror movie...NOT EVEN CLOSE. But I would highly recommend it as a psychological thriller for more mature and intelligent viewers.Also, I must add, I thought it was a terrific remake because why would they copy the original exactly? The main character is dealing with the same kind of internal demons as in the original but it's a New story...If you want the original...Watch the original!</fullReview>

It would just go from one scene, then reveal that to be a delusion, only to go to another scene, which was a delusion, then return to the first. Multiply that by about ten times and that's how confusing the movie got. And, to boot, nothing happened! What a rip!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, Innovative Remake Of A Horror Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the other comments about Carnival of Souls 1998, I now understand why I didn't hear more about the making or release of this film. Carnival of Souls 1998 apparently wasn't well received or liked, and I really can't understand why. The only reason I can determine for this is that Wes Craven's name is attached to this film. Usually this great director's name would be a positive force for a film. In this case, however, it may have been misleading. Others probably rented Carnival of Souls expecting unrelenting fear. However, this film is not in that category. Carnival Of Souls 1998 is much more than that. It's an absorbing, well-timed, thought provoking story about a troubled woman's fear of death, and her resulting fear of life. Haunted throughout her life by witnessing her mother's murder, she's likewise haunted by the possible release of her mother's murderer. She fears that he return for revenge, and she fears for herself and even more for her younger sister. Bobbie Phillips plays Alex, the troubled woman. She's brilliant, and conveys her fear with such eloquence you feel her fear and confusion as if it were something concrete. Shawnee Smith plays Sandra, her younger sister. So wonderful every week on the TV situation comedy Becker, she shows us that she has many more dimensions to her acting ability. Watch this film with an open mind. Forget about Wes Craven's name on the box and credits. You may be in for a pleasant surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Borrows the Title and a Small Part of the Original Storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The eleven year-old girl Alex Grant witnesses her mother being raped and killed at home by the carnival clown Louis Seagram (Larry Miller). Many years later, Alex (Bobbie Phillips) works with her younger sister Sandra Grant (Shawnee Smith) in the Mermaid Inn that was owned by their mother. Out of the blue, Alex is attacked by Louis that was hidden in the backseat of her car on the day of the anniversary of the death of her mother. She struggles with Louis and drives her car into the sea to protect her sister. Then she swims back to the shore on the area of a carnival. From this moment on, Alex has nightmares and daydreams with Louis. What is happening with Alex?"Carnival of Souls" (1962) is a low-budget cult movie with a story that seems to be an episode of "Twilight Zone". "Carnival of Souls" (1998) is not a remake and only borrows the title and a small part of the original storyline. The plot is boring and totally predictable, sort of a combination of "Jacob's Ladder" with "Carnival of Souls". The result is an average and forgettable horror film. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): "Parque Macabro" ("Macabre Park")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a fan of Bobbie Phillips' since I first saw her on "Murder One". Therefore, I had to see "Carnival of Souls". Having never seen the original, I rented it and watched both. I didn't particularly like the first, but it had an eerie quality that kept me watching. I watched the new version and after the first 15 min. or so saw the similarities. It was also quite reminiscent of Jacob's Ladder. I didn't love it, but I found it interesting. I wouldn't have classified it under horror and whoever does the box cover should be shot for listing "Showgirls" by Bobbie's name. She has a lot of other, better work to be credited from before and after "Showgirls". I love the way Bobbie changes her look and voice in her roles. Her voice is higher and softer than in her most recent heroine roles such as "The Crow".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but be careful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is not bad at all. But, if you want to really enjoy it, you'll have to keep in mind these two recommendations:a) FORGET THE COVER. It is not the usual Wes Craven horror film, not even the typical horror film. Don't expect a creepy movie (although there are several creepy scenes, perhaps the worst part of this movie). The horror comes from inside, from the unseen and the unsaid.b) FORGET THE CLASSIC (the 1962 `Carnival of Souls'). Do not compare this film with the original one, since it's an high percent unfaithful to the 1962 version. The 1998 Carnival is not a real remake. Perhaps it has a similar final idea, but it's not the same story.Follow this recommendations and take your prejudices off. Perhaps then you'll enjoy this well-acted movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very highly misunderstood film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course I know it doesn't come close to the original film. I saw it years ago and didn't think much of it. Then a few years later I bought it on DVD as part of a set along with LEPRECHAUN and two of David Cronenberg's movies RABID and SHIVERS. When I revisited CARNIVAL OF SOULS the plot made a little more sense. But when I read the reviews on it's IMDb web page I noticed that this film was somewhat misunderstood.1. Like in the beginning of the film where Alex (Bobbie Phillips) drives her car into the ocean with Louis (Larry Miller) the man responsible for her mother's murder in the backseat. Right after this scene the film cuts to Alex waking up in her bathtub. Many seemed to have assumed she dreamed about the crash but that is not the case. When the film cuts to this scene it actually goes back a few days meaning Alex didn't dream about the crash it happened a few days later.2. There is another scene where Alex goes to see a psychiatrist and she talks to him like they've had several sessions together. But the psychiatrist reveals that he has never met Alex before. This is representative of the reality setting in of what really happened after that crash that took place which would lead us to the final revelation or the big twist ending. Of course at one point Alex is shown climbing out of the ocean and on to the pier she drove off where she sees the abandoned carnival grounds. In fact this is really Alex's soul climbing out of the water and on to the pier. The whole part between the crash and the twist at the end is really what we think is reality that slowly turns into what is actual reality.This is how I understand or interpreted it. CARNIVAL OF SOULS is really a thinking man's horror movie. You have to pay close attention to certain parts of the dialog to grasp what certain phrases actually refer to. Many plot elements are not presented in a very straightforward manner so it requires a long attention to figure out the plot.Overall, it's not the worst film I've endured. I also agree that the original is way better. But since this film strayed from the original I didn't really try to make comparisons.There is also an unofficial German remake entitled YELLA which is also better. and had it been an official remake it would be considered the more faithful of the two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, learn why a good chilling film is interesting. Watch the original COS after midnight with the lights out and on an old cold tube driven b&amp;w TV. Goose pimples rise up, chills navigate your back, and the popcorn was really good.Now watch the remake. Begin sticking your fingers down your throat at any time. The feeling is identical to watching this mess. You will realize instantly that the taste in your mouth is not a dream, but nausea, now do your comparison.Lesson learned, leave well enough alone or don't mess with classic material and stick with making remakes of The real housewives of NJ.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utter Garbage from Wes Craven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Candace Hilligoss, the heroine of the original Carnival of Souls wrote a treatment for a sequel to the original 1962 film which remained faithful to the original story. Unfortunately Wes Craven discovered the idea and tore it apart. The remake says in the opening credits, "A Film by Adam Grossman." I don't know who he is, but the audience should know that if they ever see "A Film by Adam Grossman" on any movie, it should be a cue to run for the nearest exit! Maybe Grossman is one of Craven's aliases..who knows. The remake is, predictably, just another Wes Craven gore-fest that has absolutely nothing to do with the original film. Had he thought up a different title I wouldn't be quite so annoyed. As for Bobbie Phillips (from Showgirls no less) she is no Candace Hilligoss and, as an actress, should really try to choose her roles with more care.I'd write more but this is just another case of a very limited director taking on a low-budget classic and ruining it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this on the shelf at my local video store, I thought, "Oh, it's Wes Craven, the director of Scream, one of the best films of the 1990s, and it's a horror as well. It's got to be good!" How wrong could a young lad be? This was a horror but for all the wrong reasons. I do not think I have ever been more bored in my entire life. You can really overdose on the hammy acting, the extremely unscary clown and the annoying music in the background. It has a plot that was so thin and lame that you could hardly be aware of its existence at all. For most horror films that I watch, you can guarantee that they won't scare me, but at least they are funny!! "Carnival of Souls was not even that. It was pitiful and had no redeeming qualities at all, apart from the end credits when the pain was all over. I have watched some garbage in my time so it is unbelievable to hear myself say that this is the worst film I have ever seen.If someone paid me to watch this film again, I think I would prefer to keep my sanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the original Carnival of Souls many years ago, when the film was re-released with some additional 'lost' footage reinstated. I remember being severely underwhelmed by the movie, finding it tedious in the extreme. I know I am in the minority for disliking this 'classic', but I truly think it is highly over-rated. I haven't seen it since.When this 'reimagining' was lent to me on DVD, my initial reaction was 'no thank you', but I changed my mind on seeing Shawnee Smith's name in the credits (I've been a fan of hers since The Blob in '88). On seeing the words 'Wes Craven Presents' I almost changed my mind again, but I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. And, whilst it may never be revered as a classic, this version has enough going for it to make it worth a viewing. The story may be confusing, the ending lacklustre, and the main 'baddie' not scary enough, but I still found this to be more enjoyable than the original.Eleven-year-old Alex witnesses her mother's murder at the hands of a kiddie-fiddling carnival clown named Louis. Her testimony puts him in jail for twenty years, but you can't keep a bad clown down and two decades later he shows up wanting revenge. Held hostage in her car by Louis, knowing that after he has dealt with her, he'll go after her younger sister, Alex floors the gas and drives herself and her captor at top speed into the sea. Then things get weird.From this point on, director Adam Grossman mixes reality and fantasy, blurring the boundary between the two and confusing the audience in the process. Sequences snap from reality (or what we perceive to be reality) to fantasy in the blink of an eye, and vice versa. Alex has strange hallucinations; hideous demons pop up in the strangest of places, as does her old pal Louis.These strange goings-on don't make a lot of sense, but they are quite entertaining, and at no point did I find myself regretting my decision to watch the film. Both Bobbie Phillips (who plays the grown-up Alex) and Shawnee Smith (who plays her sister) are easy on the eye and give reasonable performances. The demonic creatures that appear out of nowhere are very unsettling and the film is worth watching for these alone (they reminded me of Chris Cunningham's disturbing videos for Aphex Twin). If only Louis the carnival clown had been half as frightening as the demons; his blonde wig and crappy make-up are lame and as creepy movie clowns go, he is a disappointment.Fans of the original have slated this film, describing it as a travesty. Although I wouldn't exactly recommend this version myself, those who haven't seen the original may find enough to like to warrant giving it a go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Carnival of Potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just recently seen Wes Craven's Carnival of Souls and I thought that it was pretty good, not great. It was marketed badly and shouldn't have bared the same title as the original as it's not much of a remake as it is its own tale. Although Wes Craven's name is shamelessly attached to the movie despite little to no involvement beyond seemningly giving his consent, ironicly the storyline actually has more potential than most Craven movies put together whether his own or just bare the name. And thats coming from a guy who loves Craven as much as the next horror buff.The potential of the story itself is one of the two main positives which outweigh such negatives as dodgy special effects. It's sort of a complex psychological war fair tale with a touch of the Sixth Senses' style. It appears to be about a tortured young girl whom is haunted by a tragic childhood where she watched as her mother was murdered by a guy whom had been a friend of the family and worked at a carnival as a clown and her evidence got him life in prison. Then of course years later he gets out and comes after her, but surprisingly in a struggle both seem to die and it seems as though her ghost is trapped in a land of the dead limbo where she appears to be living her life as normal in her mind yet the presence of ghosts and all the familiar faces of everyone in her life are trying to convince her to except her fate so she can pass over, everything they say and do seems geared to her situation, including a kind of guardian Angel figure who looks like he's stepped off a romance novel cover, which would fit with a young woman's creation of the imagination too. "Sometimes you have to face your demons before you can see the angels" At the same time the demonic ghost of the clown invades her mind, tormenting her seemingly trying to keep her from being able to move on and except her fate etc, possibly to avoid passing over himself into hell as she ascends to heaven: "The Longer you hold on, the more we get to play!" or maybe he's a sinister form of her inner demons: "Funny thing about guilt Alex, it can haunt you as real as any ghost" All in all it seems really open to interpretation. There are many interesting possibilities. My personal view is that it's just a movie about letting go and moving on. certainly points must be given for such effort to at least attempt at something complex rather than just going with the usual typical horror movie traditional slasher formula.The other biggest positive is the performances, the lead actress is convincingly haunted looking but particularly the serial killer clown character Lewis. He's quite effective in a distinctly well drawn role, which is wisely used sparingly and well portrayed by a cast against type Larry Miller. He has a great presence, is genuinely creepy and has a real sense of mystery to him. Larry Miller, another comedian character actor in an unknown, his performance was destined to be overlooked.Just remember, don't be fooled by all you read, judge it for yourself.Will you, won't you, join the dance?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alex Grant (Bobbie Phillips) is haunted by carnival clown Louis Seagram (Larry Miller) who murdered her mother in front of her as a child. Seagram gets out and ambushes her in her car. It turns out to be a dream. She runs her mother's dockside bar with her sister Sandra (Shawnee Smith). Sandra is always pushing Alex to sell the place. She falls for a mysterious stranger (Paul Johansson).This horror has nothing scary at all. It's a series of dream after dream after dream. Larry Miller could have been a creepy scary clown if the movie actually tried to be good. This movie doesn't try. The bar set looks cheap. It's suppose to be on a dock and yet it has a brick-lined basement. The whole thing looks bad. I also hate that it's sold as "Wes Craven Presents". I don't know how much he got paid but it's not enough no matter what. I've seen worst but this is pretty bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In-name-only remake of the classic '60s horror film. The original was a unique, atmospheric film that had some genuinely creepy and scary moments, made on a shoestring budget with no frills. This one is just a generic bland '90s horror flick with nothing to recommend about it unless you are fans of the cast. Bobbie Phillips is very attractive and I can't fault anyone wanting to look at her for 90 minutes. But beyond that, she brings very little to the table. Genre favorite Shawnee Smith is a little better and even gets to sing, but that's not enough to save this mess. Larry Miller, more known for his comedic roles, plays a disgusting cliché killer clown. Director and writer Adam Grossman clearly spent a total of five minutes thinking the plot to this one up. If you have seen the original, this movie will just tick you off. If you haven't, this will likely put you to sleep. Avoid at all costs. "Presented" by Wes Craven, which is rarely a good sign as he'll put his name on just about anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take everyone's advice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many people who have unrealistic expectations for a sequel, remake, or reboot. In some cases, perhaps they fell in love so deeply with the original that no film could impress them equally, or near equally. There are also cases where a film may have a low rating but be horribly good, or just misunderstood. Let me assure anyone who reads this that neither of these scenarios apply to this film. It is just unequivocally BAD, and this is one case where everyone is RIGHT. However, you may have appreciated the genius of the 1962 version to such an extent that you're willing to take the risk. That was my case. Here is what the 1998 version has in common with the 1962 film: a girl crashing into water, the same girl having what appears to be some psychotic breakdown, and a girl who eventually realizes that she has died. On the surface those appear to be similar enough to make this interesting, but it simply ISN'T. The acting is one level above bad, the characters are simply uninteresting, and the plot is convoluted. On the other hand, the brilliance of the original was in its dead simple, incredibly effective, no-frills execution that seemed unlike anything before or, to some extent, after it.Here is my genuine advice. Most people probably started with the black and white 1962 release. If you're really yearning for a new take on the film watch the colorized version of it rather than this; it will be more fulfilling. Whereas the original had me captivated from start to finish, I fell asleep on two separate occasions while trying to finish this (no matter how bad a movie is, I generally see it through to the end).If you've seen both the color and black and white release of the original, then simply watch one of them again. Go read a book. Slam your head against a wall. Really, pretty much anything is more stimulating than watching this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this movie claims to be a remake of the 1960s movie of the same name, it really isn't. It just borrows a few minor details from the original film, and spends most of its time doing its own thing. I wasn't really bothered by that, and I simply requested that this "remake" be good. But it isn't. As others here have reported, this is an extremely slow moving movie, where scene after scene of no real consequence happens. And when things do happen, it's often very confusing, not making it clear if what happens is in the imagination of the heroine or is actually happening. At the end, I was not quite sure what had indeed happened. I will say that the movie looks okay for what was reportedly just a two million dollar budget, but the decent look in no way compensates for the movie's shortcomings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>5/10 adequate movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Carnival of Souls was adequate. The only reason I watched it was because 1) I'll watch any movie and 2) the role of Shawnee Smith is present. I love Shawnee. She is an idol of mine especially after seeing "Becker" the brilliant TV show. Shawnee is perfect, she is a talented and beautiful actress whom is also, shown by this movie, a talented singer. She has it all. I haven't seen the original "Carnival of Souls" therefore I can't judge on that account. The film was pretty confusing, strange and generally creepy. The concept was fairly well and the acting was pretty average. On that note, actors such as Shawnee, Bobbie (the actress that played the main character) and whoever played Louis the clown were great actors and played their roles tremendously. The minor characters weren't very great a what they did but the main characters made all the difference. I didn't quite like the ending of the movie whereas it lacked a climax. The entire movie was also disturbing and rather confusing. I could easily abide through the boring scenes and confusing parts of the movie but truthfully, they could have done better. Although the flashbacks kept the movie alive and helped advance the plot. There were some interesting and even funny quotes in the movie, also some odd. One I was rather shocked to hear was, "Oh we're not gonna put the makeup on my face this time." What? But some quotes I liked, such as "Do you know what girls are made of? Sugar and spice and all things *checks her our* nice." I got some good laughs out of this movie. But truthfully, it wasn't a good movie. Then again, the quotes and Shawnee Smith's amazing performance made the movie semi-good. Plus the antagonist, Louis the Clown, was one bad@ss character. Therefore I give this movie a solid five out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and Bad Execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carnival of Souls (1996)* (out of 4) Worthless remake of the 1962 film has a young girl seeing a man brutally murder her mother. This man just happened to play a clown at the local circus and years later the girl, now an adult (Bobbie Phillips), begins to be haunted by visions of him. I'm not one who is against remakes as I usually like seeing how a different artist puts their spin on a familiar story. This remake only borrows a few elements from the original film with writer-director Adam Grossman making up the rest on his own. What he added is pretty silly stuff and it's really a shame because I think a straight remake could have been much better. The entire subplot dealing with the pedophile clown just adds up to nothing in the end and if you are familiar with the original then the biggest twists are already going to be known. While watching the film I couldn't help but think that perhaps the director's original story might have been a good one but at the same time you can just tell that it wasn't getting on film. The entire movie is meant to make one wonder about what's really going on but you never really have this happen because it's just so poorly made and executed that you really don't care. Another major problem is that the film lacks any real atmosphere and there's certainly no scares to be had. Even what murders are in the film are all forgettable and in the end you really start to wonder what the point of the film was. Phillips offers up a fine performance but sadly she isn't given much to work with. Larry Miller plays the clown and to say his role is weak would be an understatement. The beautiful Shawnee Smith appears briefly but she too is wasted. Wes Craven served as Executive Producer but it seems he was just cashing a paycheck and not really paying attention to anything that was going on the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film. I liked it when I first saw it years ago, and I liked it this time. I do have to say there are things about it that I noticed now that I'm older, that I didn't like, but overall the story was really good. The end especially was very memorable. The creatures were scary but reminded me of Hellraiser's cenobytes (not a bad thing), and I thought the killer clown could have and should have been scarier, more threatening. I was very upset that they somehow forgot that the little girls portraying the main characters had bright, bright green/blue eyes as kids, but as adults one has brown eyes and one blue- a totally different shade. The whole "I'm going insane" idea I do love, however, and that is what made me like the movie so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What A Slap In The Face To The Original This One Is!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING! CONTAINS A SPOILER!! I'll admit, being a huge fan of the original, I was actually interested to see this one. I think I borrowed it from my uncle or saw it on some movie channel. I don't remember.Anyhow, I sat down and began watching, ready to go. I don't remember at what point, but I knew I had been taken for a ride. My god, where do I even begin? The movie is incoherent, makes no sense, and is a whole host of other descriptions I can't repeat here. How it got made is beyond me. Why it was even green lighted is a mystery even Sherlock Holmes couldn't solve.The one good sequence in the movie is the car wash sequence. It's creepy, and I'll give it that, but the movie still stinks. And what's up with a certain part towards the end. I think the lead actress sees some weird people moving really fast, like in the ballroom sequence in the original, but, at one point, they look like pink bubble gum fetuses! I wish I were making this stuff up folks, but sadly, I am not. Please avoid this one at all costs. It's a slap in the face to the original. It really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>* * * out of 4.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are expecting your usual Wes Craven junk or a faithful remake of the original, look elsewhere. This is not it. In this film Alex (Bobbie Philips) is haunted by the murder of her mom at the hands of her boyfriend, Louis (Larry Miller), who worked as a clown at the local carnival. However, Louis has just gotten out of jail. Alex now fears that he will come after her and her younger sister Sandra (Shawnee Smith). At first she keeps seeing him lurking all over the place, but no else seems to notice him around. Then she begins having weird visions. Shortly afterwards Louis starts popping up in these visions and they soon start to become violent. However, there is one little problem, according to her friends Louis is dead.Smart, intelligent film features disturbing scenes (the love scene) and weird visuals. It also features a sad, haunting turn by Philips. She captures the right balance of being lonely, scared, sad and strong. Miller is very creepy in a cast against type role. The film makes strong statements about death, repression, living life to its fullest, and how one should not let the past control there whole lives. The characterizations are first rate. Alex's love for her sister is so strong and feels so real throughout. They perfectly explain what troubles Alex so much and just how scared she is of Louis and how Alex feels her life is going absolutely nowhere.The ending which is very simple, is also very eerie and leaves you thinking afterwards, especially the final frame. What hurts the film is the average direction and low budget, but still the good (sometimes great) far outweighs the film's faults.Rated R; Violence, Nudity, Sexual Situations, and Profanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good Little Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll spare you the details and plot of this neat little movie because they have been outlined before by some pretty narrow-minded, holier-than-thou, so called "horror fans" who can't see the noses in front of their faces. This is a pretty good little film that really has nothing to do with the 1962 original, which is the way the film makers intended it to be I am sure. Obviously, they were hoping to cash in on the name of the original and you really can't fault them for that but it is obvious this is not a remake or follow up but just the same premise of "dream world" and "reality". Good special effects, tight little story, plenty of atmosphere and a few scenes that will make you jump even if the horror "pros" who reviewed this film here say otherwise. This film is worth the price of a rental and you will find yourself surprised at it's effectiveness and the hold it has on you which will make you watch to the very end. Do yourself a favor and look past the negative reviews here and judge for yourself. If your expecting to see an updated version of the original, you won't but if you watch it, just for what it is and forget about the original, you will enjoy it. The "reviewers" here obviously didn't have enough brain capacity to judge something on it's own merits and watched this movie with the original in mind and hoping to see a remake. They couldn't get off their high-horses because they are obviously so pro 1962 "Carnival" that if it wasn't anything like the original, the 1998 film had to be trash because they can't admit to themselves this version is pretty good and gives their "original" a run for it's money! What hindsight and blindness they have! Talk about pompous attitudes and closed minds! Don't make the same mistake, watch this film on it's own and you'll be happy. Forget about the original because that was a once in a lifetime film. Trust me, you'll enjoy this little beauty!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why was this movie ever made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm at a loss trying to work out why this movie was made, or who exactly it is made for. The original 'Carnival Of Souls' is a great favourite of mine, but it's (sadly) not all that well known, and one wouldn't have thought the title would mean much to you average Freddy/'Scream' horror audience, which this movie appears to be aimed at. On top of that writer/director Adam Grossman only takes the basic "hook" of the original and loses all its power by wrapping it in a cliched story concerning a young woman being pursued by her mother's killer, a (supposedly) frightening clown.Larry Miller, best known for his comedy work (eg the wonderful 'Waiting For Guffman') plays said psycho, and is badly miscast. But that is the least of this movies problems. It's a stinker whatever way you look at it - incoherent, unoriginal, stupid, and just plain NOT SCARY. Why Wes Craven would allow his name to be associated with awful hack work like this is beyond me. Avoid this one and head straight to Herk Harvey's 'Carnival Of Souls'. There is absolutely no comparison between the two!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this 5/10.This movie is just ok.Story- A woman witnessed her mothers murder as a child. The murderer was a carnival clown that found her lost in the carnival and brought her back to her mother. The clown was invited to the house for dinner &amp; a drink, and of course the mother got murdered. Now, years later the daughter sees visions of the clown everywhere she goes. Oh yeah and the clown is played a guy named "larry miller" who was in "nutty professor 2 the klumps" . You'll recognize him as soon as you see him. This is a typical modern "horror" movie. That is made by master director "wes craven". Too bad he made this and the scream films. He really did a lot better with "The hills have eyes" , and " a nightmare on elm street."I would recommend "The Hills have eyes" , if you want to see a better wes craven picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only bothered to watch this because of its "Wes Craven" tag, but none of this grand-master's flair or even influence was evident. The movie was poorly paced; although opening strongly, it struggled throughout the remainder. The effectiveness of the film was based upon horror clichés, which, unlike in "Scream" were utterly useless. One image, of totally irrelevant leprous sreeching freaks recurred, and was probably the scariest part of the movie, apart from its horrid acting. What this added up to was a jumbled, nonsensical load of utter trash, unworthy of the great man's name.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the user comments before I watched this movie, and I thought the film could not be as bad as everyone said. I was sorely mistaken, it was worse. I am a huge Horror fan, and a fan of Wes Craven as well. But this film doesn't even have the right to be placed in the genre, more less have Wes Craven's name on it.The script, even if rewritten by a competent writer, will never be good. The whole premise of the movie was just unscary, uninteresting, and an unnecessary waste of the actors time. The actors in this film may have some talent, but it certainly can't be realized in a piece of garbage like this. The actress that plays the main characters sister in this film also play on the television show Becker starring Ted Danson. She has talent as a comedic actress, and it can been seen in that series. As for the other actors though, I don't know if they have talent at all. The other acting was equal to a poorly made porno movie. I could make a better film, and hire better actors, in my back yard with a 8mm camcorder.In short, the movie is trash. It has no redeeming qualities. Not even worth the gas money to the video store, more less the rental fee.</fullReview>

She keeps reliving the horror until she can rest in peace.Larry Miller (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) was perfect as the sleaze-ball who befriended a woman just to get to her daughters.

		<fullReview>Weird that the vote totals have an inordinate number of "1" votes, more so than usual for this type of film. I'd dare to guess that either those votes were disappointed that it wasn't a typical Wes Craven gory kill-fest, or they just are mad at Wes Craven for some other reason. Still, this is an effective and spooky, if small-time, chiller that would have been much more well-received had it been foreign. There would be this whole crowd of intellectual horror buffs spouting about all the psychological twists and turns, and the underlying meaning of the water motif throughout, and how it foreshadows and gives hints as to the true ending, and so on. Well, all of that is still there, just not in French or Japanese. I mean, really, this is just as good as The Grudge, and just as easy to understand. She really DID drive the car off of the pier, and everything in-between the beginning to the end was her in a personal purgatory because she always blamed herself for not shooting the clown/killer before he killed her mom. Once she settled that guilt trip, she left this purgatory. That's what it is. In conveying this, the film does well, but if you've grown up on simple-minded slasher and gore horror, where you're led down every path and through every door without needing to think, then you won't get it and you'll be bored. Those who give it a "1", this means you. If you think the original Carnival of Souls is a "10" then you'll find this one enjoyable and more than adequate, though not great. One last note, there are some complaints that Larry Miller wasn't spooky enough, too much of a regular type of guy, like an accountant or such. Well, WAKE UP, those are the guys that get you! Those regular types are where you'll find the killers who will surprise you. Look at BTK. How many times have you heard, Oh he was such a nice neighbor, I can't believe he did it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT a real remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the fact that it has the same title, this is not a remake of the classic chiller "Carnival of Souls". If you actually read the end titles first, you will notice that is says "based on 'Carnival of Souls', written by [...] and directed by [...]." In fact, the only thing in common with the original is the ending. Period. The rest is your typical plot about somebody being stalked by the ghost of someone who had tried to kill him/her before, and nobody can see the horrible images but him/her. It is of course filled with nightmare sequences, some which are obvious, others that not. But the story is confusing and doesn't make sense until the end. And the end doesn't make sense unless you've watched the original. So there's a dilemma here.Otherwise, there are obvious indicators of being a bad film, such as that it is executively produced by Wes Craven (translation: Craven put money in a friend's film and will earn a commision from it, yet has no imput on the film itself), the director/writer is the same of "Sometimes They Come Back... Again", and there is a short scene that is identical 100% film-wise to the typical Skinemax soft core flick sex scene setup (which gets cut off by another nightmare just when it is starting). It is also slow. However, it does contain a few chilling scenes, particularly the one in the car wash.Not a terrible film, but not really worth a rental, but instead for waiting for it to show up on cable one day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is a journey through the psyche of a woman (Alex) with a traumatic past and emotional scars. There are numerous switches between realities which result in Alex thinking she is losing her mind. Viewers can be forgiven for not understanding what is going on, but that is kind of the point! What you are supposed to understand is the emotional roller-coaster ride... It kind of reminded me of The Butterfly Effect, but without any control and more random (continuous) jumping through memories/realities.Also worth noting is that I watched the movie a second time and realised that there are several cryptic messages in the dialogue throughout this movie, which help make the ending easier to accept.Bobbie Phillips was great in this movie and she had to be as the entire plot is driven towards the viewer having sympathy towards her character. The rest of the cast was adequate (excpet the guy who played Michael, he was pretty bad). The effects weren't great and should have been better for a movie made in 1998. I wouldn't say it was a bad ending, but it definitely could have been better. However, it was generally well scripted and well directed.This film isn't really scary at all, so I wouldn't recommend it to traditional horror fans. It's not by any means "easy viewing" either, so I would recommend it to people who like to think about what they are watching and have patience to let a story unfold. Also fans of psychological thillers.Not a classic by any means, but I enjoyed it a lot and will most likely watch it again in the future. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing and Pointless. How Can Wes Craven Be Involved With This?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing that this remake of the cult classic was coming from Wes Craven, the director of such classics as "The Last House on the Left", "The Hills Have Eyes", and "Scream", I thought it might be okay. But I was so very wrong. If I learned anything from this, it is that titles with "Wes Craven presents" at the beginning of them usually aren't very good movies.The film centers around a woman who is in a car accident whose life is turned upside down and everything around her seems to be dreamlike - her life completely spins out of control. What's real and what isn't? "Carnival of Souls" is one of those movies that has the protagonist caught up between flashbacks, dreams, and reality, which irritatingly confuses the viewer time and time again. These flashback sequences to the main characters childhood (and the murder of her mother) happen so frequently, that the audience has no idea what's going on. One minute, the main character is in her house, the next she's running from a rottweiler in an abandoned carnival, then she's on a boat having sex with some guy she barely knows. What is that? Don't get me wrong, flashback and dream sequences are okay in movies, but they have to fit in with the rest of the movie. They can be effective if used properly, but in Carnival of Souls the only effect it has on you is to make you want to stop watching, because by the middle of the film you are completely confused and have no idea what's happening. I will say that this movie had some potential, but just completely lost it. I've heard the original is brilliant, I hope it's much better than this garbage. An extremely confusing mess. 3/10.</fullReview>

It certainly isn't a slasher movie or evenyour typical ghost story, but one thing's for certain: it's apsychological "head-trip adventure" film that is closer in spirit toFellini's "Juliet Of The Spirits" than typical Craven fare.(SPOILERS AHEAD) PLOT:The movie centers around and is veiwed through the psycheof Alex, a woman whose mother had been killed by a serial killerwhen she was a little girl. She and her sister work at a run-downbar on the beach, just below where they live. Alex begins havingnightmarish visions of the man who murdered her mother, andother things like sideshow mutants, evil carneys, deadly clowns,zombies and most of all drowning...HIGHLIGHTS: Those mysterious red balloons, the Grim Reaperclown, the scene with a half-melted cartoon clown head, andvarious eye-popping special effects.FINAL WORD: A very strange film, something like Fellini mixed withJodorowsky. Certainly not for everyone, but OK "head" film. Get thisfor the clownophobic on your Christmas list!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Thought this movie was good, it was kind of hard to follow though because they jump from scene to scene but it explained it in the end. Its about a girl who's step father was thrown in jail 20 years ago for killing her mother and he gets out of jail now and keeps coming back for her but he comes back for her through her mind like she sees him standing there but no one else can and it shows how her child hood and her present life now come together. This is a very good movie, its creepy when you think about it after you see how it ends and its also kind of sad too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Wes Craven's Carnival of Souls" is a pretty dull affair with a few good moments.**SPOILERS**Years after their mother's death, sisters Alex, (Bobbie Phillips) and Sandra Grant, (Shawnee Smith) are still upset the day their father Louis Seagren, (Larry Miller) killed her in front of them. As adults, weird visions start happening to them, making them wish to leave their small-town home quicker. When the visions start to get more intense, she starts to seek comfort with nearby worker Michael, (Paul Johansson) and they start a relationship. As the past keeps coming back to haunt her, she finally gets the strength to stand up to it before it is able to completely control both their lives.The Good News: When this one tries, it's not that bad. The big one is the hallucinations and the visions, which here aren't that bad. This one here pretty much goes with these as the solid points since all of them are really entertaining and some quite frightening. The freak-out in the car wash is the freakiest one, since it slowly builds up the potential for something with the ominous focusing on the one employee and the shadows in the background playing havoc. When it turns into the big hallucination attack, the atmosphere is built up beautifully, for it does that change beforehand and comes through perfectly. Another freaky scene is the one in the bathtub, which doesn't even start off like it would but then quickly changes into a pretty frightening vision at times. That there's the brief ones scattered all throughout are also quite nice, as it changes them up and really tries to do something with them. That they can happen at any time is a fantastic quality, as there's a feeling of suspense in waiting for the next one to occur. That alone is pretty good and gives it a good reasoning for a viewing. The back-story is decent enough and has some really creepy ideas thrown in. The last positive is the big stunt scene, which is the only real action in the film and really gets over. These here are the film's good points.The Bad News: Despite it's good points, this one was really underwhelming. The complete and utter inability to make the main villain a source of fear is something to get over. This one has a main villain that fails to do anything in here that could cause fear in them. Popping up in hallucinations and day-dreams, which are obvious when they occur since the villain shows up, to attempt to torment the victims yet never laying a physical hand on them is quite shocking, since the actions prove that they're something to be reckoned with, yet the behavior does nothing and really hurts the villain. That is also done in with the never physical but only mental harming, and these really drop the film down a lot. The dragged pace is also somewhat troublesome, especially since the film decides to concentrate simply on the hallucinations for the shocks. It really stretches out the film and makes them feel like they're done in pretty infrequent intervals with boring filler in between. That isn't far off, as most of the time spent waiting for the hallucinations to come back offer nothing but boredom, and these are really problematic. There's little minor flaws, such as the sex scene being really sloppy-looking and not coming off at all realistic or believable or the fact that this one never really tries to capitalize on the notion of clowns being something to add fear to the film with their constant appearances, but the main ones here are the first two flaws. Those will be the ones that keep the film down the most.The Final Verdict: While it's not that spectacular, there is enough going for it to be entertaining that there is something worthwhile about it. If the boredom can be overcome, then this one could prove watchable, but those looking for more than a few shocks won't be terribly impressed with this one.Rated R: Language, Violence, mild incest themes and a clothed sex scene</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen some really bad horror movies in my time, films so awful that you wonder why they were made, NIGHT OF HORROR, HOWLING 7, SHE CREATURE (2001), BLOODTHIRST: LEGEND OF THE CHUPACABRA &amp; many, many, more &amp; CARNIVAL OF SOULS (1998) is right at the top of that list. The bigger mystery however is not how or why this movie was made, but why did WES CRAVEN, the man who brought us such gems as SCREAM &amp; A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, produce this confusing awful mess? I can pretty much guarantee you, that CARNIVAL OF SOULS 98' will be near the top or close to it on your list of truly terrible horror films you've seen throughout your time. The film has a heroine played by BOBBIE PHILLIPS being taunted by her mom's ex-boyfriend, seen dressed as a clown in some flashbacks, whom she thought she had killed, after he came after her once he was let out of prison (He killed her mom years prior) amongst his many appearances in her life, she also has to deal with annoying faceless squealing creatures that appear in quick shots, but every time she finds herself in a tight spot, she wakes up in her bedroom or her bath tub or materializes in the middle of another scene that just passed in the film, adding to total confusion to scenes that might be set in the past, present or future or hallucinations or dreams, I mean was WES black mailed or paid a whole lot of money &amp; I do mean a lot, so that the film makers could add his name on the box to help sell this dreck &amp; like I said with Blood Thirst &amp; Howling 7, how did they ever get released? who thought they were good enough to show to the public &amp; do these person who helped release them have a thing against humanity?. I know I'm dragging on here, but take my word for it folks, DON'T RENT THIS! it's really as bad as I'm making it sound! 0 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Herk Harvey's original "Carnival of Souls" was a pre-"Night of the Living Dead", haunting Bermanesque thriller, shot in glorious black and white on a $33,000.00 budget. It featured nightmarish visions one does not easily forget. This remake, though, is best forgotten. Although the budget was obviously higher than $33,000.00, the movie would not be worth the price of admission into a theatre, and I'm not sure, but I think this went straight to video. The remake has added a few unnecessary elements of gratuituous violence, in gory colour, hits you over the head with the quirks of a miscast villain (Miller, who's done much better)....subtlety is not the keyword here. But I guess they figured the audiences of today aren't going to get it unless you jackhammer the point into their skulls. I don't mean the gore, there isn't enough gore in this one to keep a 12 year-old interested. Now, if you have never seen the original and were expecting a good sound thriller, well, this is no "Silence of the Lambs". This isn't to say the movie doesn't have a few good things going for it. I mean, Cleavant Derricks has a part! When I read that on the box I immediately rented it. I felt cheated because his part is minimal and he deserves a lot better. If only the makers of this knew who they had in their hands they might've spent some more time on him, rather than playing with the audience in a game of "Is Bobbie Phillips going to take her clothes off or not?". After a loooong time of blandness and banality (nothing much happens here), you quit expecting something to happen and just hope the actress will strip, or blow up a car or something. There are movies in which nothing really major happens, but we are still drawn to them, they interest us. This isn't such a movie. At one point a completely uninvolving character bursts into song! There is nothing to do between shock scenes so let her sing, they must've thought. Of notice is Wes Craven's name all over the video box when he was only executive producer (and we all know what that means: zilch).My advice to the cast: take this movie out of your resumes. I want my money back.</fullReview>

It's bad enough they had to pick on a classic horror film to remake but they didn't even do a decent job. Wes Craven has produced a lot of bad movies. They're either too weak to even be classified as horror or they're just flat out lame and unwatchable. Don't Look Down is an example of weak, it was on the level of a Lifetime movie. The Carnival of Souls remake is a flat out turd. The film makers should rename the film something else because it is unworthy of being called Carnival of Souls.The movie bare very little resemblance to the original and it's full of cheap shocks and thrills (unlike the original). If you encounter this movie either on the television or at the video store I suggest you walk the other way. This movie is that bad.Not recommended at all.</fullReview>

Interestingly enough, there is a general consensus amongst those that dislike this particular work. Those individuals were either not frightened or not entertained. Convincing. Among those who express a fondness for this film we see no such solidarity. In fact, no two people seem able to agree on the plot points, much less the symbolism and meaning therein. Odd.

		<fullReview>In many ways, fear is ignorance. The unknown can be a source of unspeakable fear. The creators of the 1962 `Carnival of Souls' knew it and they made a simple and clever illustration that became a cult classic. Their heroine was haunted by the vision of a ghoul who was claiming her: she was denying her own death, and she had to join the dead. No need to explain if the woman came from a dysfunctional family, if she had been sexually molested in her childhood or if she was a bad organ player. But this remake of `Carnival of Souls' tries to explain everything (even why there is a carnival in the plot), and the result is bad. Terribly bad.But let's be fair: in more than a way, this motion picture is a consequence of what scriptwriting specialists and film schools teach: overemphasis on `character development', `plot', `plot points' and all that crap. Italian Neo-realist filmmakers had better definitions of such: the characters in their films ?like the father in DeSica's `Bicycle Thieves' or the addict girl in Rossellini's `Open City'- were defined by their surroundings, by their simplest actions: a smile, a look or a word, and not necessarily by psychological crap like what's been added to the original story of `Carnival of Souls' to explain the heroine's behavior and hallucinations. That's why the Neo-realists put so much emphasis on what to frame, and how the characters related to the persons and things around them, instead of roaming in their psychologies: they left that to psychologists or their colleague Antonioni, who was a master in describing psychological instability, but, again, relying on what was around his character: take Monica Vitti in `The Eclipse', alienated not by political dialogue or situations, but by the beauty of Alain Delon or the coldness of cityscapes.On the other hand, the importance of plot has become a myth: I am sick of reading comments about the `lack of plot'. Each life is a plot; each one of us is the star of the daily plot of our lives, which is the source of most works of art. Can any of us truly claim that in our lives nothing happens? Even saying so is a `happening'. In literature, when a life is trapped by routine, lack of motivation or `nothingness', that is enough material for writing a whole chapter. This trivial overemphasis on physical actions and plot twists that, in the end, we have seen a thousand times, does not equal good cinema. `Carnival of Souls' is the proof.Some persons do not recognize the original story in the remake, but it is there, along with enough plots for other five movies and psychological clichés (or `character motivations') that read like a catalogue for a bad film, including gratuitous sex and murder scenes. On top of that, although its theme is Death, it is not even overwhelming, and so poorly directed that the actors have little to do in the middle of so much inner turmoil and so many curtains floating.</fullReview>

First of all, the movie does not deserve the title "Carnival of Souls". The original movie was an amazing, inspiring classic about a survivor of a car crash who doesn't realize she has died. It was the inspiration for Night of the Living Dead. Not only was it a classic, but it was the mother of the zombie genre. This remake is so low on the totem pole, you can't really even call it a movie. The plot was jumbled and confusing, it didn't resemble the original in any way shape or form. And only someone who actually saw the original would even know what was going on at all. It was boring and it sucked. I've never been so upset at a botched remake before. What a waste of time.

The was no plot, very bad acting, and absolutely no action. Wes Craven had better start watching what he puts his name to nowadays. It took him more than a decade to restore his credibility after the late 80's wilderness years, and even his last "credited" movie, the appalling "Wishmaster" was fun if you (like I did) watched it while having a drink with a few rowdy friends.Enough is enough.

		<fullReview>When I heard they were remaking "Carnival of Souls" I nearly passed out. The original CoS is one of the most atmospheric, creepy films of its time. Part of its charm was the fact that it was made &amp; set in the sixties, and I was convinced that no remake could capture the flavor of the original (much like the Psycho remake). Well, it turns out that I was right, but fortunately this dung heap went straight to video where hopefully no one will see it. Ever.The film makers decided to keep the name of the original and throw out the plot, which I guess was a good move, but the new plot sucks. Plus, they screw up the characters. The female lead in the first one was an unknowable, almost soulless mystery woman. The new one is painted to be sympathetic, and we see her history (normally a good idea, but not for Carnival of Souls). Also, they create a link between her and the "Mystery Ghoul"- another BAD IDEA. Also, because they wanted the film to be not just awful but offensive, they throw in a child molestation theme. Ewww!Surprisingly, Larry Miller is effectively sinister in this. He is usually tapped for comedic roles, but he shined as the sick, sadistic villain in this. Too bad the script sucked, his make-up was awful, his character was TOO unpleasant, and this movie sucked. Also, the voyeuristic neighbor from the first film appears at the end of this as a cop, but you know what? The movie still sucks.So don't see this movie. Ever. Tell a friend not to see it, either. Maybe they'll tell two friends, and they'll tell two friends, and so on and so on and so on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, overlong and repetitive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was a horrid waste of a dollar. The whole film can be "understood", if that's the word, by watching the first and last fifteen minutes. Apparently a remake of an earlier film, but it's so much like _Jacob's Ladder_ it's uncomfortable - some of the visuals could have been dubbed directly from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it sucked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>that was a horrible story as it made you expect something to happen next but it doesnt and nothing is even unexpected as it was only a story of a woman tormented by childhood memories as all the evil was in her mind and finally her psycopathic mind destroyed her in the end. it was not terrifying or "horror"ifing as it was so classed as a genre. it should have been put in the drama section because noone dies, and nothing dangerous goes off except a suicidal mind. it was dumb to have luis in the car at the end as the authorities would wonder how the hell a definetly rotted away man could be found dead but with fresh skin and organs in a drowned car? so never watch it, you will be bored the whole time</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror or Drama?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carnival of Souls starts off promising, but goes downhill awfully too soon. Yes, we know Alex is haunted by memories of her mother's death and lives in fear that the killer is coming after her, but will you get on with the film already?I really wanted to like this film, but there were too many lost plots, irrelevant characters and it's slow pacing. I really wanted to like it. It would've made an excellent drama, but they ruined it by marketing it as a horror film and by placing these weird chernobyl freak things in Alex's nightmares. Total disappointment.Shawnee Smith was very charismatic and delightful as the younger sister. Bobbie Phillips (who looks like a cross between Claire Forlani &amp; Natalie Imbruglia) was excellent and quite touching at times. Larry Miller, who really only appears in dreams, etc.. was funny as the perverted psycho, but lacked development.Carnival of Souls was well acted &amp; directed but lacked in the writing department. The only horror was in the dreams, and films in this genre need more than that.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second Worse Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After "Fear Of Clowns" this is the worst film I have ever had the misfortune to see.It narrowly beat "Fear Of Clowns" in that I forced myself to watch it through to the end. I wish I hadn't wasted valuable minutes of my life in doing so.Like many of you, I was tricked into watching it by the association with Wes Craven. Needless to say, I will not be tricked in the same fashion again.Very poor. So poor, that I remembered its name after all this time. This film is memorable only in its level of ineptitude.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Souless Producers, Carnival Actors and Balloon to keep together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An amazing piece of trash, whose VCD I picked up from a garbage bin of the slums.Think of the movie this way: watching old TV series Kung Fu and add all the flashbacks and mix them all together. What do you get? Carnival of Souls with pointless flashbacks. The only part that really made sense was the first 5 minutes of the movie and 5 minutes in the end of the movie. Cut out the middle part and voila, the movie has too much trash in the middle.The most memorable part of the film is when there were a couple of people playing poker and turned into dead people. To me they looked like at first to be silly putty. Then I realized my mouth was watering because they looked like orange taffy. This is how horrified I am of the movie, for my saliva is now 12 inches badly wanting to eat these delicious taffy people.And the killer of the movie was TRULY memorable. For he looked exactly like one well known comedian on HBO. Truly memorable you just can't be scared with him but rather be laughed silly out of funny looking Mr. Bean like face. He is could be a shoe-in for Bob Hope telling jokes to Vets. No not war veterans, veterinarians.And what is it with the red balloons? It is here, it is there, you think it was some kind of symbolism. Well it is intended to be a device to get continuity of the unrelated flashbacks together. Symbolism wasn't properly used or tied up to the woman's life. It was awkward in fact to consider using balloon or carnival or the fact that the murderer use the face of the clown. The story would be more stronger if they concentrated on the pub theme or family conflict theme. They jumped here there everywhere and it made no sense.The idea of the movie is in similar vain to Jacobs Ladder, but without any theme, plots, or story line. Just one confused woman who thinks she is imagining things. I could make 24 hour movie, by showing the things she's imagining, but what's the point spending 1 hour watching things people are imagining, if only they have some comedic value. Oh, did I say this movie was a comedy, sorry this is a horror movie unintended to be a comedy. Which is why it is so bad.If you like this kind of movie that was much better done with unrelated trash as to sex harassment, meaningless murder, why the murderer came back again, etc. pointless flashbacks, I strongly suggest you watch Jacob's Ladder, the plot and theme is strong, and you have a strong attachment with the leading actor. In this movie you feel no passion for this woman.If you like this movie or you feel that the movie should be improved, then look nowhere but the movie Hellraiser: Hellseeker. This movie uses similar story to Carnival of Souls but brilliantly interweaves a man's death when his car is sunked into the river and died in relation to having his soul taken away from him. It is brilliantly interweave and I am sure you will love this film genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a weak attempt at movie making. It does nothing but confuse the audience. This by no means belongs in the same class as the 1962 original. An argument could be made for the 1962 version that it is what to do right in making a movie;whereas this current piece of trash represents how bad a movie can be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Remake of a Classic Gone Waaaaaay Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven [sole worthwhile credits: the initial "Nightmare on Elm Street" films and "Scream"] adds to the balance of his awful resume by exec. producing this inept remake of a masterpiece.Actually, it's not even a remake, but a total rewrite of Herk Harvey's eerie B&amp;W 1962 zero-budget cult classic ~ this version focuses on bad visual FX [surprise!], siliconed buxom women who keep their clothes on, implausible, seemingly tacked-on-from-a-different film situations and an utterly lame climax completely unlike that of the original's.Former stand-up comedian Larry Miller ["that's another tip from your Uncle Lare"] plays the bad guy ~ and is so effective that his stand-up career seems now in jeopardy ~ at least for the 17 people who actually watched this flick.Bobbie Phillips, whose best-known previous appearance on celluloid was as an extra in Paul Verhoeven's deplorable "Showgirls," takes on the role made famous among cult film followers by Candace Hilligoss. She fares well in another disaster.Shawnee Smith ["Julie Lawry" in the dreadful TV miniseries, "The Stand"] is given the star "and featuring" credit. Smith is actually better known by the numerous requests on the 'net's newsgroups for her [thus far non-existent] nude photos.After this piece of dreck, she may have to resort to going for the nude shots.I beg you to seek out the creepy original film... it's a keeper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite complicated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carnival Of Souls 1998 was a film that I wanted to see for a very long time. I've seen the original Carnival Of Souls, which I'm a big fan of (that film's brilliant) so I wanted to see the 1998 one. The film (1998) is about a young woman named Alex Grant, as a young girl she witnessed her mother get murdered by a carnival clown named Louis Seagram, (he tried to rape Alex's mother and kill her) Alex's evidence in court puts Lewis in prison for 20 years. She then begins to have nightmares of Louis Segram and the carnival where she met him. This film is not as close as being better than to 1962 cult horror classic Carnival Of Souls. The 1998 film is classified as the one of the worst films ever made, but it's not completely bad. It's very confusing, there are loads of dream sequences in the movie,I was thinking to myself at some points 'Is this a dream.' Carnival Of Souls 1998 is far from being a five- star movie, It's a 2- star movie, by that I mean that it's quite watchable. The acting in this film is Okay. Larry Miller's performance as Louis Seagram is the best</fullReview>
