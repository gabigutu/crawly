		<fullReview>This is one of those movies I saw in the theater as a kid. Simply put, it was hilarious. Maybe it was mob mentality, but virtually EVERYONE in the entire place was laughing uncontrollably throughout the entire film. We're talking a real side-splitter here, folks. I have never laughed so hard at a movie before or since, with the possible exception of another Disney film, "The Absent-Minded Professor" (1961) which I also saw in a theater.So what makes a good film, anyhow? Fantastic acting? Great plot? Beautiful cinematography? Superb directing? Babes? Well, you can't say it had any of those things. But it DID set out to do what it attempted to do, which was: make people laugh. A lot. And that makes it, in my opinion, a pretty darn good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleuthing in suburbia--Walt Disney style--after a small town teller is kidnapped by two bank robbers. Not only does this comedy feature the least-objectionable performance by Dean Jones EVER, it also has Hayley Mills and Dorothy Provine as a wonderfully kooky pair of sisters AND a fantastic feline hero. This Siamese cat is just gorgeous, and it's a lot of fun watching the bumbling humans trying to tail him down alleys and city streets. The bad guys of the piece are also letter-perfect: threatening but not overbearing, just enough menace to make the kidnapped woman's scary predicament that much more real. I also loved the next door neighbors (a wacky Elsa Lanchester and William Demarest), Hayley's surfer-boyfriend named Canoe, and befuddled Ed Wynn as a jewelry salesman. Simply put, a wonderful modern-day caper for parents and kids. Puts the remake with Christina Ricci to shame. ***1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't seen this movie in 30 years when my kids decided to rent it the other night! The cast is classic, from The Riddler(Batman), to Roddy McDowell, to Uncle Charlie(My Three Sons). And of course, Dean Jones and Haley Mills. It's one of those timeless, goofy Disney comedy classics that stands in a kitsch class of it's own! Ya gotta see it again!YMMV if you're a tweener at this point (too mature for it's cornball silliness, and too young to be nostalgic!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>well worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is well worth watching for the entire family (some might take offense at the title). The cast is wonderful with Dean Jones as always bringing the house down with his suberb acting and dialouge. It is pure slapstick all the way through and you don't get tired of it either. Haley Mills also does a good job although her acting here would probably not get her any rewards. Most animal movies I don't care for because they all do ridiculous things and can get away with it only because they are an animal. Not here. The producers used the cat in a way that made it very enjoyable to watch. All in all, this movie is well worth watching because of its suberb acting and its storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this about '74 or so, it was great. Loved the garage door gags, the cats, Elsa and William, the two gals are fine, Hayley Mills especially. Dean Jones had to have been in about 100 Disney things back then, this was def. one of his better roles. You also have to like what they did w/ the baddies, Neville Brand and The Riddler. They work well together and do a fine job w. the mix of comedy and real malice towards their captive. The cat was a funny part, i remember them trying to 'paw print' him and them winding up plastering poor Dean Jones head to foot w/ the cat's inky paw prints.Say what you will, Disney doesn't make things like this anymore and that is our loss.*** outta **** it's fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have fond memories of watching this as a child, but I thought my memories might be too rosy, so my expectations were not high as I got ready to re-watch this film. However, it was surprisingly entertaining throughout, except near the end, where I agree that the scene showing everybody trailing everybody else went on a little too long. You can tell the plot was taken from a novel - there are several funny lines, there is more telling detail, the bad guys are convincingly threatening (as others have said), and the characters are more three-dimensional than usual for a 1960s "family" movie. The teenage heroine (played by Hayley Mills) is resourceful and actually has a steady boyfriend(!), though of course she never kisses him, even at the drive-in! I also like the actress who plays the hostage - she *looks* like an older woman who might actually work at a bank - not like a Hollywood glamour girl! I haven't seen the 1997(?) remake, but I suspect it isn't as good as the original. All in all, an enjoyable movie for a Saturday night at home!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"That Darn Cat!" can be considered the first in the series of human/animal buddy caper films (see "K9", "Turner and Hooch", "Oh Heavenly Dog" to name a few). And it's also one of the funniest.D.C. is a clever and precocious Siamese who is forever getting into mischief, but who forever remains one of filmdom's coolest cats. But when D.C. (for "Darn Cat" - though D.C. is also an acronym for something unspeakable in a Disney Film!) becomes an unsuspecting witness to a bank robbery/kidnapping, he finds himself the FBI's most valued informant.The cast of this of this cool Disney caper is sophisticated, intelligent and frequently hilarious. Hayley Mills, as D.C.'s overly-zealous owner, has finally graduated to womanhood, while still maintaining the girlish charm that captured the hearts of Pollyan-ites and Parent Trappers everywhere. Her lines of dialog are extensive, and though her voice begins to grate after a while, she is both smart and quite ballsy for a teen of the early 70s. Dean Jones as unflappable FBI Agent Kelso manages to display a dignity, wit and charm not usually present in the straight man of a Disney Comedy (Who else would remain calm as the little beast nearly tears him to shreds, covers him with ink, and leads him on three separate chases in pursuit of the elusive wild goose?).Bad guys Neville Brand and Frank "The Riddler" Gorshin simply ooze evil when they are coolly discussing the potential fate of hostage Grayson Hall. Even now as I watch this movie, I really BELIEVE they would do serious bodily harm to this poor woman, in much the same manner that Roddy McDowell (as a hot-headed and stuffy neighbor) would be willing to de-gut our hero, the cat.And therein lies our focus - the cat. This brave little feline is the true (and UNBILLED!) hero of the piece. And D.C. clearly is capable of holding his own against overwhelming odds. Even with star talent surrounding at every turn, the writers were smart enough to keep the focus on D.C. and his antics. The assorted chases, the jealous boyfriend, the vengeful neighbor (with his duck dinner clutched firmly in hand), the bickering couple next-door; all revolve around or are in some fashion related to, the actions of the furry little sleuth.The writing is fun; speaking on a heretofore unseen level of intelligence to its young audience. The result is that children are entertained and clearly understand what's going on, while grownups marvel at the complex doings in a small town that are precipitated by one mischievous kitty and the screwball humans that surround him.This film is a whopping credit to Disney's talented live-animal handlers and art direction teams. The sets and scenery in this delightful little any-town are realistic enough to make you believe they are a real community, yet spritely and colorful enough to make you want to move there... The drive-in movie theater scene still gives me a good laugh.In all, "That Darn Cat!" is a delight to view on multiple levels, whether you're all alone, or in a room full of pre-schoolers. For an extra treat, pick up any CD by Disney that has the film's title track by Bobby Darin. The cool loungey tune rings vaguely of Harry Connick Jr. and would probably be right at home coming out of the pipes of Ol' Blue Eyes, Mr. Sinatra, himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney Should Make More Films Like This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My main problem with Disney now is their live-action films. Although their animated features are miles ahead of every other company's (yes, they are), they seem to have forgotten to add the same quality to their live-action movies. Disney, give us more movies like "That Darn Cat!" (the remake never happened for me) "The Princess Diaries" was very good, in my opinion, but it's nowhere on the level of this movie. Like someone else said, this film doesn't talk down to children; it spurts big, clever words like "conspicuous" and doesn't care whether the kids will get it or not. This film is clever, fast and amazingly funny. In fact, I'm shocked it only got a measly 6 out of 10 here. It deserves much, much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad for a Disney comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably about as good as the Disney comedies of the 50's and 60's get. I think one reason it works is that it doesn't exist in that goody-two-shoes world where many Disney films of the past took place. The crooks in this film are nasty guys, they steal, kidnap, and nearly beat and kill their female hostage. Not that that's a good thing, but it's certainly uncharacteristic for a Disney film. The script is also well written, the dialogue is, for the most part, believable. It does get a little too long toward the end though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better Disney family comedies from the '60s...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Siamese cat not only has the title role, he steals the film! The silly plot involves a couple of bumbling bank robbers (FRANK GORSHIN is one of them), who kidnap a woman from the bank who's able to signal for help by putting her wrist watch around the cat's neck. The cat belongs to HAYLEY MILLS, who picks up on the signal and then must convince the FBI to help her (and her cat) find the robbers in time to save the woman. DEAN JONES is the earnest but bumbling FBI man who decides to help Hayley.All of the incidents surrounding the cat are deftly handled with a great deal of humor. ELSA LANCHESTER and WILLIAM DEMAREST are funny as snooping neighbors and RODDY McDOWALL and ED WYNN have some good moments too. But it's HAYLEY MILLS at her most appealing and "that darn cat" that really steal the show. The cat "DC" is simply amazingly natural and perhaps the most convincing member of the cast.Summing up: One of the better Disney comedies during the '60s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Darn Company doing 'Full Frame' DVD transfers again!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That Darn Cat (1965) was director Robert Stevenson's attempt to bring the girlish Haley Mills into womanly ? if comedic ? contemporary grace. She plays Patricia Randall, the impetuous wannabe sleuth and owner of D.C. (short for Darn Cat); a cross-eyed Siamese, sporting a wrist watch instead of a collar around its neck. Turns out the watch belongs to a bank teller who was taken hostage during a daring robbery. Enter FBI agent Zeke Kelso (Dean Jones), a congenial and squeaky clean cutie by 60s standards to whom Pat is immediately drawn. She's too nice to tell him how much she likes him. He's too polite to tell her to buzz off ? especially after Pat takes it upon herself to enter the investigation as an active participant.This is one of those dated Disney comedies that, despite erring on the side of conservative caution and hopelessly virginal good humor, nevertheless hooks its audience with a flair for clean fun and corny vignettes. On this occasion, one of the running gags happens to be that poor Zeke has an allergy of kitties. This presents a problem during the film's pivotal showdown, since he can't seem to get his fits of sneezing under control. The impressive supporting cast includes Frank Gorshin (best remembered as the Riddler on Batman, but here put to good use as Iggy ? the bank robber), Elsa Lanchester (as meddling, Kip MacDougall), Roddy McDowall (stuffy Gregory Benson), and Ed Wynn (as Mr. Hoffstedder ? a zany watch jeweler). Remade in 1997 to nauseatingly dismal effect, this precocious diversion from the Disney stables in the one to beat, and, with a theme song warbled by no less a singer than Bobby Darin ? what's not to love? The DVD transfer from Disney, for one thing. It's full frame! A very clean picture element, minus scratches and with a color palette that simply glows, is what you'll find on this occasion. Rich, solid blacks, very bright whites and natural looking flesh tones are the order of the day. Also, fine details are very nicely realized and film grain is kept to a bare minimum. The audio, though dated, is natural sounding for audio recordings of this vintage. Bobby Darin's song fares the best, with a sonic spread that will leave you toe-tapping for vintage 60s kitsch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than the remake by a country mile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film may be unexceptional and not a 5-star masterpiece but goodness isn't it an improvement over the 1997 remake? Even with Christina Ricci in it, that film turned out to be very disappointing if somewhat watchable with one or two decent performances to savour. This 1965 film is a little too long and dated, and there are some parts where it is a little slow, however it is a lively piece of entertainment that is efficiently directed and is further advantaged by an exceptional cast. The script does have some nice, subtle, humorous touches while the music is nice and the plot carefully constructed. The cast elevate this though from a moderately enjoyable film to an entertaining, lively if somewhat unexceptional one. Hayley Mills is just perky enough in the title role, and William Damerest and Elsa Lanchester are fun support. However it is Dean Jones as the FBI agent with a cat allergy and Roddy McDowall as a drip whose ducks are the feline's favourite playmates who are the standouts in the human cast, while it is the cat who steals the film by a considerable whisker. Overall, not always exceptional, but a vast improvement over its remake. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Feline Performance in Movie History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've ever had a Siamese cat, you will know that they are the wise guys of the cat world.In the history of the movies, there haven't been too many significant cat performances. Cats do not take direction well. On the movie set, they probably spend a lot of time arguing with directors over how to play a scene. If the studio would let them, cats would probably want to direct the movie themselves."That Darn Cat!" features the best movie performance ever by a cat. The leading man -- or cat, in this case -- is a crafty Siamese named D.C. (Darn Cat). He is the star of the movie, the one who carries the story. And he does it with suave feline sophistication. (Never mind that several cats played the role of D.C. in making the film. They were *all* good.)D.C. is a smooth operator. Like Bogart, he prowls the back streets of his suburban L.A. neighborhood, the king of his territory, his blue eyes observing everything, his nose to the wind, his mind working out all the angles.Throughout the movie, D.C. is performing tricks and stunts that would make Lassie or Rin-Tin-Tin envious. Take the movie's opening scene. D.C. hops up on a backyard fence, attracting the neighbor's dog, a Scottie, who jumps up and down at the fence, barking furiously, trying to get the cat. Then, D.C. hops down and slips into the yard through a crack in the fence. He strolls casually past the barking, leaping dog, and helps himself to the dog's supper dish. Eventually, the dog turns around. He does a double-take and runs at D.C., who calmly slips out through another crack in the fence.It's a classic Siamese trick! I have *owned* Siamese cats who would pull tricks like that on the neighborhood dogs.One night, when he is out for a stroll, D.C. stumbles into the hideout of two bumbling bank robbers (Frank Gorshin; Neville Brand) who took a female bank teller (Grayson Hall) as a hostage in their last robbery. The bank teller puts her wristwatch around D.C.'s neck with a message for "help" on the back, and tosses D.C. out the door.When D.C. returns home, his young owner, Patti Randall (Hayley Mills), finds the watch and the message. Patti is smart enough to figure out what has happened, and contacts F.B.I. agent Zeke Kelso (Dean Jones). The following night, the F.B.I. sets up a unique operation to track D.C. through the neighborhood, hoping the cat will lead them back to the bank robbers' hideout.The movie has a genuinely funny script, co-written by Bill Walsh (screenwriter on "Mary Poppins") and Gordon and Mildred Gordon, authors of the novel, "Undercover Cat," on which the movie was based. I've read the novel, and the Gordons really knew their cats, and how cats relate (or don't relate) to humans.A lot of the humor in the movie comes from D.C. having to deal with "non-cat people," especially Agent Kelso, who is allergic to cats. One of the funniest scenes in the movie comes when Kelso has to take D.C.'s paw print, and can't figure out how to fit D.C.'s prints onto the standard FBI fingerprint card. Needless to say, D.C. does not like having his paw printed.Hayley Mills does well in her last role for Disney. As Patti, she projects a kind of eager, Nancy Drew-like enthusiasm when she finds herself embroiled in a mystery. Even when the FBI starts to doubt her theory that D.C. has found the bank robbers, she still persists in her investigation. She knows she is right! Perhaps that's why she is the only human in the film that D.C. puts up with -- he finds her to be of equal intelligence to himself.There are small but ingenious supporting performances in the movie, little gems of character acting. Dorothy Provine plays Patti's older sister, Ingrid, who can't believe the fuss that occurs. Roddy McDowell is Ingrid's snobbish boyfriend. Elsa Lanchester and William Demarest are a pair of squabbling neighbors who know that something is going on next door. And Tom Lowell plays Patti's dopey boyfriend, Canoe, who is obsessed with surfing movies.(Some of the funniest gags in the movie occur late in the film, when Canoe accidentally gets involved in the FBI's trailing of D.C. through the neighborhood.) There are some funny cameos. Ed Wynn plays a nervous shop owner that Patti cons into helping her with the investigation. Iris Adrian has a great scene as a landlady who bullies the two bank robbers. And Richard Deacon has a funny role as a drive-in manager.But again, it is D.C. the cat who really carries the picture. It is the cat who outwits both the FBI and the bad guys, and saves the day at the end of the film. He probably wouldn't even care that Hayley Mills got star billing in the movie. For D.C., the greatest joy would be in the giving of his performance -- for what greater joy is there for a cat than simply the joy of...being a cat? P.S. The sly opening song, written by the Sherman Brothers, and sung by Bobby Darin, sets the tone of D.C.'s character perfectly. It is the most accurate song ever written about the character of a cat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Funny After All These Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie, I was ten years old. For the longest time, it was my favorite Disney live-action film, and, do you know what? It still is. I don't like cats but D.C. will have you rolling in the floor with his antics. Interesting cast with Haylie "Miss Bliss" Mills playing D.C.'s owner and instigator of his sleuthing with the help of Zeke Kelso (Dean Jones, who incidentally is from my home state of Alabama.) And what's this? Dr. Julia Hoffman (Grayson Hall) of DARK SHADOWS fame plays a kidnapped bank teller with The Riddler from BATMAN (Frank Gorshin) and Al Capone (Neville Brand) from THE UNTOUCHABLES television show as the heavies. There is also good old Uncle Charlie from MY THREE SONS who plays a beleaguered husband trying to keep his nosy neighbor wife out of other peoples' business. Those scenes toward the end of the movie when everyone is following each other are a real hoot. I'll say one thing for D.C. He knows how to keep an entire neighborhood on its toes. Wonderful, clean family fare. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, but I am Cat Biased.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anything I write about this title must be considered biased by the fact that I like seeing cats in movies! And the cat in this one was absolutely great! A great cat-actor and shot great in some excellent realistic alley-prowling scenes. Don't get me wrong, it's not documentary realism, but live action "Top Cat".The very fact that a movie was made with a real live cat as it's ( near ) central character is in itself something I find amazing. But the movie as a whole is very entertaining. Hayley Mills is pleasantly incongruous in the American setting. I'm glad that she only used a slight American accent in one of the early scenes and then dropped it. It amused me greatly to look at the baby-faced actress and think "thats the mum of Kula Shakers front-man" ( if I'm not mistaken ). When she put her glasses on she appeared to become the prototype of the brainy girl in Scooby Doo.Dean Jones is almost a cartoon stereotype of the variety of sharp-suited young man that I think must by now be long extinct. His clash of cool and bumbling is perfectly pitched to seem both natural and comical."Canoe" is a beautiful caricature of another variety of "hep cat" long gone. I didn't even realise that at one time it was cool for a young man to smoke a pipe! So the movie works as social-history as well!The side-story about the nosey neighbour is gently hilarious. Especially when a cop, told she's a man, tells her "You shouldn't dress as a woman, you don't have the face for it." Frank Gorshin is spot on as a dim-witted hood.The dog was excellent.However, the whole point of the movie is that darn cat! Does anyone know if he appeared in any other titles?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've lost count of the number of times I've seen this film, one of Disney's Top Five. I'm rather prejudiced, though, as I'm now living with a direct descendant of "DC" named BJ IV. We bought his (DC's) Great-Grandson from the breeder who bred the original "DC" and not only have the papers from the CFA naming the Disney Studios as his owners, but have managed to keep the direct lineage going, as BJ IV is "DC's" direct descendant. He's now 7 years old, and BJ V is currently in production, and should be born in October of 2005. The film is a classic, and if you're a Meezer Fanatic (You love Siamese Cats) you'll watch it forever too. UPDATE - Feb. 2006 - BJ V is now 4 months old, is as cute as a bug, and since his paws look like snowshoes, he's apparently going to be a BIG Kittie, like his famous Great-Great-Great-Grandad!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Gordons wrote an excellent screenplay based on their novel, "Undercover Cat", but after viewing the original release print produced by Ron Miller, Disney executives thought it was (1) too short and (2) that it could be improved and have far more box-office power if it was spun out with a large number of extra scenes, featuring a vast array of guest "stars". The Gordons either refused or were not offered this opportunity, so Walt Disney handed the assignment over to his close friend, Bill Walsh, who was also asked to produce, replacing Ron Miller. Little effort was made to disguise the seams. For this and other reasons ? too violent, far too drawn out, too much pandering to teenagers ? this is not one of Disney's best live-action movies, even though "That Darn Cat!" tries to be all things to all viewers. And anyway, at 116 minutes, it's somewhat too long for the kids. It's also, as said above, far too violent. Yet, on the other hand, it's too nonsensical for adults to take seriously. Most of the actors overplay their roles. Some, like Bill Demarest, Roddy McDowall and Elsa Lanchester do it all the time. Others like Hayley Mills, Dorothy Provine and Dean Jones do it only half the time. Best performance comes from Neville Brand who makes a really hideous villain, guaranteed to shed a year's growth from any under- twelves (or even sensitive early teenagers) who are unlucky enough to come into contact with this movie. Available on an excellent Disney DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Darn Cat and His Crazy Cast!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hayley Mills and Dean Jones head an all-star cast in this wacky, over-the-top, and unbelievable Disney film about the FBI tailing a cat, as it's a lead in a bank robbery/kidnapping case. When Neville Brand and Frank Gorshin rob a bank for $160,000.00 and take bank teller Grayson Hall with them, they hide out - only to be found by a hungry cat on its nightly rounds. She, Grayson, puts her wristwatch on the cat in place of its collar with a half-written HELP carved on the back of the watch, which of course sets off imaginative, highly intelligent and cute Hayley Mills on her quest to help the bank teller, of whom she's convinced has put the watch there. Dean Jones is an FBI agent picked by Hayley to help her and is given the odd assignment to follow that cat! Of course, he's allergic, too - of course, naturally. Tom Lowell is Canoe, a friend of Hayley's, who takes her out to surfer movies and eats her out of house and home, when he hangs out with her, stuffing his face with monster sandwiches. His jealousy of Dean and what's going in that house puts him in many situations and which provides much of the humor here. William Demarest and Elsa Lanchester are bickering neighbors who I'm convinced were inspired by the Kravitzes of "Bewitched." While mildly amusing, they were a little ingratiating to me, mostly her antics in being nosy. Dorothy Provine is Hayley's sister. Dean Jones makes it all look so easy as he underplays his unbelievable situation of tailing a cat, named DC for darn cat. But, perhaps the scene-stealer of the whole movie, besides the eerie cat is Roddy MacDowell, who drives sister Dorothy to work and has romantic designs on her. He is exactly perfect as the exasperated and outraged victim of DC's shenanigans. He doesn't underplay or overplay the role. His comic timing is on spot and this may be perhaps his best comic role in film. Disney must have had a sense of humor with "That Darn Cat." Anyone in a serious mood may find this awfully silly, but this is a wildly good and highly enjoyable time with a great cast and with a cool song sung Bobby Darin!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a wonderful and very entertaining story with a lot of great humor. It's quite a unique story with a lot of interesting elements. Some parts are a bit frustrating, but it all works out. Many of the scenes with the robbers are a bit disturbing and frightening, it would probably be rated PG if it was made today. But it's all part of the story. Dean Jones did a lot of great Disney films in the 60s and 70s. It's interesting that this was his first, it's just as good as the others. I think there should've been a few more scenes showing the arrests near the end, and what happens afterwards, but it shows the important parts. This is one of those films that often has me imagining what would have happened right afterwards. It's a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What time is it Kitty Kat?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That Darn Cat! is out of Disney Productions and directed by Robert Stevenson. Collectively written by Bill Walsh and The Gordons (Mildred &amp; Gordon), it stars Hayley Mills, Dean Jones, Dorothy Provine, Roddy McDowall, Neville Brand and Frank Gorshin. Music is by Robert F. Brunner and cinematography by Edward Colman.When DC the Siamese cat is found to have a watch around his neck, one of his owners, Pattii Randall (Mills), alerts the FBI to the possibility it's a clue to a recent kidnapping. Cue much malarkey as humans and cat try to solve the crime whilst staying one step/paw ahead of the criminals...Utterly harmless fluff from the House of the Mouse, That Darn Cat! is basically a live action cartoon. Away from the wonderful cat(s) performance - and the skillful capturing of said cat(s) reactions to situations - there's no great technical genius here. Nothing wrong with that, this is good old fashioned entertainment for the kids to chuckle along with and for the adults to smile at. Yes some of the performances are twee or precious, and the story is silly, but it's honest family fare that's also boosted by Ed Wynn and Elsa Lanchester in secondary support slots. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the book was better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The novel, "That Darn Cat," was written by The Gordons and published a few years before the movie came out. I read the book and it's excellent. It's set in Los Angeles and clearly has an adult slant, although people of all ages who like mysteries would enjoy the novel. There was both humor and suspense in the book---but the movie was written like a sitcom and everyone acted too silly and zany. The movie should have been filmed on the streets of Los Angeles rather than the fake-looking backlot of Disney Studios! Obviously The Gordons (husband &amp; wife mystery writers) knew that in order to turn their excellent novel into a Disney film (circa 1965) they had to write a screenplay that was bland and silly. The movie is okay but the novel is much better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heady mix of Disney-cat cinema and crime drama - say yes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best films I have seen, it's very funny in the sort of whimsical way which you should be aspiring to appreciate--it is also a compelling and well-paced thriller with plenty of menace and mounting tension. Hayley Mills is excellent; the main bloke (the one who is an F.B.I. agent) is very good; the one who is Hayley Mills' boyfriend is fantastic, very very funny; Roddy McDowall is always adequate; the sister is quite good; Elsa Lanchester is great; the one who is Elsa Lanchester's husband is also really good--I don't know his name but I saw him in an episode of The Twilight Zone or one of those shows the other day and he was very good there too; the main baddie is excellent, very scary; Frank Gorshin is the other baddie who is a bit nicer but also dangerous! ...And of course this film is notable because it also features a cat, which is very rare; the cat is actually not that great, it's in some ways the weakest member of the cast and doesn't really pull its weight--it's not a cute cat (which is good): that would have been an elementary error, all the same it gives a lacklustre and disinterested performance reminiscent of recent Robert de Niro roles. Let's not worry about that though, this film is bloody brilliant and you must all try to see it if you haven't already. Yes!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute, sweet comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first thought as the movie started was that it was "a live action Tom &amp; Jerry". The film spends a lot of its time following the title cat, and whilst the cinematography and editing(complete with footage that has been sped up for comedic effect) might not break any new ground, it works really well, and the overall product is entertaining and never really slow or repetitive. The humor remains fresh throughout, and in spite of several changes of perspective and which characters it focuses on, the whole thing runs smoothly. The picture may not be intricate, but it's good for what it is, it's good to watch without having to think, and hey, it never claims to be Shakespeare. This is good, slightly goofy and occasionally overplayed(but never to the point of annoyance) fun, with a Siamese cat in the lead. The score, as my fiancée pointed out, surely to fill with just the cat on the screen, is most apparent when, well, it's only the cat on the screen. It works very well, a nice jazz composition(keep your ears open for a Batman-esquire cue(although this precedes the infamous show)). The acting is fitting... some is over the top, some nicely underplayed. Grayson Hall does well with fairly little in amount. The plot is fairly simplistic, and many of the situations come from complications and such. I recommend it to fans of Hayley Mills, cats and Disney. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gosh Darn It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I re-watched TDC, I was planning on giving it a recommendation for inclusion in a family library. That was because it has such a talented and wonderful cast and because this film is considered a Disney classic. They even made a remake for Pete's sake.I was only mildly amused in the beginning and somewhere part way through something clicked in the film for me. I noticed all the chases and characters running here and there and everywhere and then realized that 'Hey, this really is worth writing home about.I was busy reading a book on Bob Hope when I was watching it, so I didn't pay as much attention as I should have given the film. Gosh if I'm going to review films I should give them the attention they deserve gosh DARN it.But I have seen it before and should see it again. But despite the non-descriptive review, I can say it is another Disney film that is worth putting in your library because it is a fun harmless picture that little ones can watch without cause to worry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting flick!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney brought back Hayley Mills to do this movie, the 1965 film "That Darn Cat!" It's a movie about a crime-fighting detective cat. What else could I say? It's fun, it's great, it's exciting, it's a great Disney film!!!!!I haven't seen this movie yet, although I have seen the 1997 remake, and that was good. I've seen the tail end of this 1965 version on the Old Disney Channel in 1997 in the afternoon (Wow. They don't do things like this anymore!!!!!) I have heard about how good this film was, and it's on DVD now. Maybe I'll check it out sometime."That Darn Cat!" has just one slight problem: it's a cat movie!!!!! This would continue five years later in "The Aristocats," a seriously dog-free film! Ugh! LOL10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unthrilling Uncomic Thriller Comedy !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the longest movies in history. It was more boring than watching water vaporizing in a glass under the sun ! And at one of the authentic posters you'll read "Walt Disney's Most Hilarious Comedy". LIARS, LIARS ! It is an insult to both Disney's studio and us !! The cat is dull, and most of all incredibly ugly. His presence is awful on screen. The kidnapped woman was creepy, I wonder how the 2 kidnappers didn't die out of the horror of looking to her face ! Frank Gorshin is the best one ever impersonated Richard Burton and Burt Lancaster, the thing is here he gave the worst impersonation of Richard Wedmark. He was overacting with no comedy, and watching him was nothing but PAIN. Roddy McDowall was totally wasted, as much as everybody I think. Dean Jones did one of his worst roles and movies. His comedy as someone who's allergic to saying the word cat (??) was damn pathetic. His sudden cold whenever he faces the cat was there, then wasn't. He seemed unfunny idiot for half of the time, and stiff for the rest ! And how come Hayley Mills talks with a British accent ?! Nobody contributed to give any explanation for that ! Even the title song, sang by Bobby Darin or else, isn't great or entertaining !This movie suffers from too many unfunny characters (adulator nervous neighbor, elegant FBI agent, chief of police who works as a chief of police, older sister who combs her hair before sleep, ..) I felt bland all over. Look at the old lady next door, played by Elsa Lanchester. According to the way she looked and shot, she was horrendous, and anything but laughable. At one moment she does slap her poor husband. Not a funny thing by any mean ! True there were more amusing characters (noisy landlady, neurotic jeweler, subdued semi-deaf husband), however ? sorrowfully ? they were all unused ! The main situation is dealt with by shamefully uncreative style. The sketches are dry, and there is absolutely no step goes ahead in the matter of the hostage or the search for her. Simply the comedy and the thrill are beaten to death in this movie. I watched so empty, so talkative, so silly first and second act. Then there was a short third act where some comedy and thrill appeared, yet didn't pay off 2 hours of useless nonentity before it. Being 80 minutes movie should have been more merciful !There is something greatly sexy about Hayley Mills. I believe that Hollywood, and the life, of today don't have girls of that shape anymore. Her short blond hair reminded me of my obsession; Marilyn Monroe, her type of clothes did seduce me more than looking decent, and with those glasses she oozed special sex appeal. But that too much politeness annoyed me. At times I wanted that crazy-about-surfing boy to give his girl a French kiss, that FBI agent run accidentally into the older sister while she's naked in the shower, I wanted the unforgettably raunchy weather forecast's girl, with the black swimsuit, dance erotically non-stop for as long as she can. Well, I see daydreams such as these only when it concerns a movie with nothing to love or watch !What I'll remember form it though is some lines. The old "I know what cooks in your tiny little mind". The witty "I didn't come in from Stupidsville on last night's bus!". The expressive "I look yuck in yellow!". And the most funny, rather the only funny, : "Get me the police. I want to report a prowler. Yeah, he's dressed like an old woman. Running around, looking in windows. And tell your men to be careful. He's dangerous!".In other cases I may say "For the nostalgic feel of it.." NO. FORGET IT UTTERLY. THIS TIME I WOULDN'T. Because except very few factors : The bright image, Hayley Mills' presence, some lines, and that unforgettably raunchy weather forecast's girl, this is a movie that fails at achieving its goals. It ends up as bad memory, or ? at best ? sweet torture. A darn cat, a darn movie !</fullReview>
