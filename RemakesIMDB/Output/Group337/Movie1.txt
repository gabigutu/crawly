		<shortDescription>Slick but inevitably inferior remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake is like listening to a cover version of a Beatles song. You like it but really want to hear the original again. The original Omen is such a terrific film, convincing, beautifully cast and with a great, raw Brit Gothic feel to it. The remake is a slightly glossier affair which is enjoyable enough but doesn't really take the story in any new directions, although it hints that it will. Opening images of 9/11 and the Asian tsunami promise a new take on the tale, but with the exception of the very final scene, this doesn't really happen. The set pieces of the original were beautifully done - here they're well done but don't seem to last long enough; they don't feel 'special' enough. The cast is good but, again, it lacks the gravitas of the original. This ambassador is no Gregory Peck. Overall, this isn't a bad way to spend two hours in the cinema - it's a hundred times better and more cinematic than The Da Vinci Code for instance - but could have been a lot more than it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unnecessary Re-make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A re-make of the original horror classic of 1976, this film offers nothing more than the original film has already given us, besides some admittedly impressive death scenes. This re-make is far below the standard set by the original film. The acting is stiff and stilted, with Liev Schreiber (as Robert Thorne) giving a thoroughly one-noted performance which proved to be quite frustrating to watch for over two hours. Even when he finds out about the incredibly terrible events that consistently occur throughout the film, Schreiber keeps an indifferent expression on his face. This undoubtedly makes many problems arise; how can the audience get involved in a movie if the actors are unconvincing in their roles? Julia Stiles does well, but she doesn't work in her role as Robert Thorne's wife, but Mia Farrow as Mrs. Baylock gives the film a bit of a spark in an otherwise dull film. The main thing is, is it scary? Damien is creepy enough, and there are some OK dream sequences that offer a couple of good jump scares. But this is all it offers in scares. The film is basically just a re-shooting of the original scenes, except they lack the energy and tension. There is no sense of foreboding, and it's almost as if the film makers and actors were just bored and wanting to get it over and done with; it's as if they hardly cared about making a good film. What was meant to be a gripping, horrific and intense viewing experience right up to the stunning climax becomes a boring and plodding time, and you just about lose interest in the whole story, and the characters. Overall, a very disappointing re-make, which begs the question: Why did they re-make it in the first place?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a nutshell, if you've never heard of the original or are unaware of the storyline, the average horror film lover will enjoy this flick. If however you saw/liked the original, you'll likely still enjoy it..but you'll know exactly what's coming next because it is very faithful to the original. In fact, in most scenes, it's a line-by-line remake, and many camera shots are virtually identical to the 1976 version. What has changed is that Damien's parents are younger, and it's been updated to reflect a contemporary world of today. Also, the screenwriter decided to throw in 9/11 and recent disasters as indicators that the Armageddon is on it's way via Damien Thorne. (SPOILERS FOLLOW) There are elements of "Final Destination", but the original Omen was in fact the first to play with this type of death scene(s), where things mysteriously happen to people through strange accidents,etc. Having said that, these scenes are a little different from the original (most of them anyway) and again, as a horror fan, you'll enjoy the fact that they don't pull any punches graphically.Acting wise, the film was somewhat weak - particularly Mia Farrow's performance. In an fitting homage to Rosemary's Baby, Farrow is cast as Mrs.Baylock, the satanic disciple, summoned to protect the Devil's son (in a sense, like her character in Rosemary's Baby)Damien Thorne, in the form of a nanny. I found that she was not nearly as creepy and menacing as the original actress. Julia Stiles was not strong either, and Schrieber was OK. The kid who plays Damien isn't bad, but it's just another brooding kid role with few lines so it's tough to screw that up.Visually i loved this film, and a few sequences in particular were very very well done. As for the scares, there aren't many at all, and a few could be seen coming a mile away (dream sequence/mirror open then shuts to see apparition in rear,etc..) I did jump physically in one sequence where i wasn't expecting it (which i won't mention specifically so it may surprise you too).So, it was an entertaining 2 hours. Nothing terribly new, and not as creepy or Gothic as the first one. In a way, i was hoping it might go in a different direction, but perhaps, it's the producers' ultimate compliment to the original - keep it very similar,just updating it for a new generation of horror fans.

		<shortDescription>Not as good or evil as the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked the original Omen. It didn't need to be re-made. There is nothing that modern film-making has brought to this film to make it stand out against the original. It's not as scary, not as honest or raw. The original film is genuinely disturbing -- from the dogs, to the nanny, to Damien... this modern remake just isn't as convincing. It has it's moments, and isn't that terrible, but there's an annoying distance, or separation between the subject matter and the film. It's too clean, too polished... it just isn't evil enough.The music is not as good, the deaths are not as disturbing. But should we judge this film on its own merits? No, because it's a carbon copy remake. There is very little new material worth mentioning.The only positive thing to say is that for anyone who hasn't seen the original, it's worth a look -- on DVD. But even then I'd recommend the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good remake. Against all odds, I liked it a lot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was able to get into a press screening leading up to Fox's big "Omen" press junket in NYC.Judging by the IMDb boards, people seem to be going into this remake with some very strong preconceptions. People who hate the mere idea of an Omen remake so much they'll never allow themselves to enjoy this will obviously come away disappointed. But I'm a fan of the original, and I can honestly say I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this. It may be the first effective horror remake Hollywood has pumped out.First, let me clarify: this is not, by any stretch, a shot for shot remake in the style of Gus Van Sant's Psycho. It is fairly faithful to the original plot (this is, in my opinion, a good thing) but various things have been added, and those scenes remain the same have all been reworked either in minor or significant ways. I just rewatched the original a month ago, so it may be that I was more attuned to the differences, but I found they hit a good balance in keeping close to the original while adding flair and revamping certain things.The remake starts out in the vatican with a scene comparing modern day disasters to eerily similar imagery foretold in the Book of Revelations. I wasn't thrilled with the idea of clueing in the audience to the fact that the antichrist was coming so early in the film, but the scene is well done and was effectively creepy. The use of 9/11 footage (as well as starving africans and hurricane katrina) apparently caused someone to storm out of a Q+A with the director later in the week (alas, I wasn't present at that event). I didn't find it tasteless, but I'm guessing this might divide audiences. At any rate, it's a genuinely unsettling opener.We're then introduced to the new Robert and Kate (as she's called a few times in this one) Thorn. There's a brand new death right at the outset of the film which I won't spoil, but which fits in well and offers an explanation for the young couple's sudden rise to power. From there, the plot unfolds pretty much as expected, but with a few twists. Kathy's paranoia is emphasized a little more heavily, with some nightmare sequences relating to her newfound pregnancy. And a couple of the deaths are redone. Kathy's new death is particularly hair-raising. Immobilized in a full body cast with her jaw wired shut, she can only cry and try to scream quietly as she's held down and a murder of a particularly medical nature is exacted. Mrs. Baylock also gets a brand new sendoff involving a sledgehammer, a car, and a rainstorm. The audience I saw it with (mostly critics, even!) cheered at her death.The original's deaths weren't exactly low-key, and for the remake they clearly wanted to up the ante. This isn't necessarily a bad thing - the results are fun to watch and sometimes disturbing. But I did find myself snickering occasionally at how over the top the offings were. It's not enough that the priest get impaled, he has to get a face (and chest) full of glass too. Not enough that the mother fall and break a rib, she has to plummet down the tallest foyer in the history of movie sets and shatter every bone in her body (who decides to casually water flowers on a teetery chair overlooking a three story drop, anyway!?). And so on.The biggest surprise of the remake is that it's scarier than the original, which I always considered to be more of a creepy drama than a horror film anyway. This is shot like an out-and-out horror movie, and it works well. There are only a few jump out scares, but it has a much tenser, more nail-biting pacing than the original.The cast is, for the most part, very good. The supporting cast is actually more memorable than in the original, with David Thewlis and Mia Farrow being the standouts. Farrow's Baylock is particularly interesting, masking her true intentions with a sickly sweet exterior. Her approach to the character is a departure from the original (some may miss Billie Whitelaw's icy turn) but I thought it was one of the best things about this remake. Pete Postlethwait and Michael Gambon are their usual reliable selves. The leads are the weak spot. Liev Schreiber's a damn fine actor, and he actually holds up well as long as you don't try to draw any direct comparisons to the legendary Gregory Peck. But Julia Stiles is merely adequate. It's not a great role in the first place and, unlike Lee Remick, she doesn't do anything to make it memorable. She's not bad, but she doesn't bring any weight to the part.The one tangible failure of the remake is the score. Marco Beltrami's music is effective and, in other circumstances, I might even laud it as a solid effort. But it just isn't as distinctive or memorable as Jerry Goldsmith's legendary "Ave Satani." The fact that Beltrami didn't even see fit to work some of the original themes into his score is a just a painful missed opportunity. And by the time some Goldsmith finally does show up over the end credits, it's just salt in the wound.Minor reservations aside, this is an effective movie in its own right, and it won't poop all over your fond memories of the original. Whether a remake was needed at all is another debate, but considered on its own merits, I found the new Omen to be good, scary fun. I'd advise people to go in with an open mind - you might just like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Omen" is one of those movies that still hold up so well, there's really no need to remake them. The date of June 6th 2006 was probably the most tempting thing for producers to release a new version of this film now.Well, you can't say they did a bad job. This year's "The Omen" is solid as a rock and very faithful to the original. So faithful in fact, that one has to wonder what the whole point of it is.Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles are an odd choice for the leading couple but they're both okay in their respective roles. The direction is just okay, too, but you gotta be thankful that no cheap scares (or not too many of them) were thrown in to keep viewers interested. On the other hand, it must be said that the movie is a bit slow at the beginning, especially if you already know the plot. Opinions will differ on how well recent events such as 9/11, the tsunami in Sri Lanka or the death of Pope John Paul II. were integrated into the story, but that's not really a major issue. The few changes John Moore made involve a different way of dying for one character and two or three rather effective dream sequences (the last one sticks out - it's a sequence of really creepy images without any sound effects at all, probably my favorite moment of the whole movie). Also watch out for a nice reference to "Don't Look Now".The most interesting thing, however, is the complete absence of the infamous choral score that made the original so scary. God knows why it's not here, it sure wouldn't have seem dated.If I realized anything watching this movie it's how amazing the script was in the first place. It builds up perfectly, it's thrilling as hell (excuse the pun) and there are no plot holes to be found. This is why "The Omen" still works greatly and will hopefully be enjoyed by a lot of young people who haven't seen the original. For everyone else there's no reason to spend money on a movie we have already seen in a superior version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't understand this remake binge Hollywood has gone on. Has everyone just gotten too lazy to come up with any original ideas? Some remakes that improve on the original might be worth the time, money, and effort to produce (not to mention our hard-earned money to go see), but not this one! The original The Omen is a horror classic and one of the scariest movies of all time. There was no way they could have topped it. So why did they do it? Like in almost every horror movie, some characters die. The deaths in the original are, to say the least, imaginative. In the remake, the deaths are either watered down copies of the original or changed in such a way that they take away from the story or just aren't as effective, and one death near the beginning of the movie doesn't even make any sense. Who is this person and what does he have to do with anything? Absolutely no explanation, just a disembodied scene that has no connection whatsoever to the plot that I could see.The atmosphere in the original builds and builds, and is very creepy. In the remake, the atmosphere is kind of blah. And what about Damien? The kid says like three words in the entire movie. And he just doesn't have the presence of the little boy who played Damien in the original.There's a lot to gripe about and almost nothing good to say about this one. There's probably only one scene in the entire movie that I enjoyed, only because it looked a bit more realistic than in the original. But why pay 4 or 5 dollars to rent a movie out for only one scene? It's just not worth it.I can only hope that they don't remake Damien: Omen 2, my personal favorite of the Omen trilogy (I don't count the fourth one they made with the little girl in the starring role of the AntiChrist, which is a joke). It would be adding insult to injury!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Insult To A Horror Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I'd like to say that Richard Donner's 1976 "The Omen" is not so much a horror film as it is a supernatural thriller. My Summary merely refers this film coming latest in a parade of bad horror re-makes ("Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "Dawn of the Dead", "The Fog", etc.).As most know, "The Omen" was a 70s movie about an ambassador who's baby dies shortly after its born and agrees to take another baby in its place without telling his wife. Five years later deaths start to occur and he begins to fear he's raising the anti-Christ. It was a well-made, subtle, smart suspense film. What made it a classic also made it a prime target for re-making.It's not the 70s anymore, it's the 2000s, so naturally some things have changed. I expected them to. The poem from the first film is here interpreted to refer to recent events, like 9/11 and that Tsinumi. Since this version takes place in present day it only makes sense. However, opening the film with a slide-show of these things at The Vatican is not only extraneous, but insulting to the viewers intelligence. We all know quite well what time we are living in.Ignoring that, we have the pleasure of watching the truly talented Liev Schreiber tackle the role of Robert Thorn, originally played by the late and great Gregory Peck. Naturally he's good, and easy to watch. However when paired with Julia Stiles, trying to claw her way into Lee Remick's role as Katherine Thorn, things don't work out so well. Working from almost the same script, the sympathetic mother, through pure delivery, is transformed into a shrill and spoiled nag. The actors sort of cancel each other out, talent-wise.Ignoring that, we come to the action. As in the original, the plot is moved along by mysterious and terrible deaths. Save for the first one (added for spice, I guess) they are nearly identical to those in the original. However, director John Moore is of the hyper-fast Xtreme school (he also made "Behind Enemy Lines"), so Richard Donner fans beware. I won't spoil things, but I will say that adding screams, flashes, glass shards, fire, and then subtracting the showiest death of all did NOT help this story or this film.Ignoring that (if one can ignore so much), is the music. Jerry Goldsmith won an Oscar for his score to the 1976 version. It was a very hard won Oscar too because it was pitted against not one, but two scores by the great Bernard Herman ("Obsession" and "Taxi Driver"), and right after his death, meaning Goldsmith competed against great talent and Acedemy sentiment. In short: it was a great score. Marco Beltrami's score to this remake was hardly a match for it. I can hardly remember it. Goldsmith's "Avi Satani" will be with me until I die or lose a piece of my brain.Ignoring all that... assuming I'd never seen the original, I'm sure I still would not be impressed with 2006's "The Omen". The uneven pacing, the poor delivery, the un-scary dream-sequences, and the generally bad direction make this movie a stinker. It was obviously made to try and cash in on the gimmick of 6-6-06, which is cute at best. They might as well have realized the cheese factor and thrown Iron Maiden's "The Number of the Beast" on the soundtrack (no offense to Iron Maiden).The original was a classic for a reason. It's sequels and this remake all remind us why it should have stood alone under its own still potent strength.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw a sneak preview of The Omen tonight. At first, I couldn't tell if it was going to be a spoof of the original or if it was going to be a serious remake. Audience members were laughing at parts which were supposed to be serious.and then ...the entire audience jumped.and a little while later jumped again.by the end of the movie, the audience was cheering and totally wrapped up in the movie.The director did a great job of pulling us in.Does everyone already know the basic plot? If not, I think it's best if I don't say anything about the plot, so I don't give away anything.Mia Farrow was great in her role as Damien's nanny. Julia Stiles was the one who was unintentionally funny at the beginning of the movie, or maybe it was intentional, because she ended up pulling off the role quite well.but the movie belonged to Liev Schreiber. He wisely did not try to do the same as Gregory Peck, and was excellent in the role.It's worth seeing. Be forewarned - the movie is much more graphic than the original, so don't take the kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie was good, better than expected, don't know why but it reminded me a lot to stigmata, anyways, picture is pretty good all over the movie, characters were chosen fine, i think Julia Stiles is still too young for her character, the kid was amazing, of course never like Harvey Spethens but still, the new Demian's smile was one of the best things on the movie, priests were fine as usual, and the nanny wasn't scary as i expected. The deaths were probably he highlights of the movie, absolutely well done, i think i jumped off the chair like 5 times. Now the worst thing, THE MUSIC, something so necessary in this kind of movies, it felt many times that appropriate music was being missed. so, an overall of 6 out of 10, great movie to have a good time, not one to remember. Happy 6/6/6 to everyone</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a pathetic attempt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very very outraged with this film. It totally lacked any of the suspense and horror that the Donner classic was abundant with. None of the supporting performers turned up or wanted to turn up. Pete Postwaite's performance of a guilt ridden man desperate to right a wrong before cancer killed him cam off as a ho hum sedate and at times seemingly sane man. Not sure if anyone here has conducted a birth of the son of Satan and the killing of another human and then have to be on morphine daily, but Postlewaite's effort was a cross between Obi Wan Kanobe and the host of lets make a deal.I didn't feel for any of the thorns and so was never taken along the journey to their ultimate doom. Bad directing and bad performances lumped together with no respect or reverence for the Goldsmith score resulted in a pathetic piece of cinema outrage.They should have re-released the original instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched all of the original Omens. And I was excited to see the remake. Man was I wrong. After seeing the remake, I was thinking how can they think they did justice to the classic Omen. How could they have thought to lay a finger and tamper with the film! The kid's acting reminded me of the 6th sense kid when he whispers. I have no idea why they casted Stiles, besides to attached a Hollywood name. And Schreiber needs to like, never do another movie again. He was the same throughout the whole movie: expressionless. I mean people complain that actors overact, but man that guy doesn't even do anything. Twitch your face, do something. And it's funny how every time they went looking for a priest, it has to be this hunchback of Notre dame looking ugly, and the over exaggerated music, it's like OK we get its supposed to be scary. And I love the grave part, where he needs help to brush off a couple of centimeters of dirt, to so easily push a lid off of a wannabe coffin. Seeing the gorilla in the zoo made me want to watch King Kong again. But I must admit the nanny was a great villain. She made me want to kick her butt! I couldn't stop laughing during the whole movie, because it was so unbelievable, and dumb. And I could also hear the whole audience around me laughing at the mockery as well, and they were also making comments out loud about the poor film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to like this remake. I really did. But I can't and the reasons--like Satan--are Legion.You never realize how important good movie music is until you can compare two films with similar stories and different scores and realize that the original gave you such creepy, stunning music that what is in the remake can never compare. Sorry, but it just can't. If they copied so much else from the original, why not the score? It was vital.Liev and Julie are just not interesting enough or grounded enough to be able to root for. And who cares that there are allusions to their marriage being a little rocky? Hello! We don't care about that! We want to know about the AntiChrist Kid you adopted, so don't get off on side issues that don't advance this plot.And what's with having the priest actually say "his mother was a jackal" right at the beginning of the film???? That was one of the best suspense builders in the original. Was it because they didn't think we would understand what a jackal was? The worst was Liev giving him a serious look, as if to say, "hmm, must take this under advisement." And the decapitation of the reporter was BETTER in the original. It was done from the side, in slow-motion, and then the head rolled and landed at Gregory Peck's feet, a chilling sequence which we knew was coming and they built up to it with agonizing slowness. The new one had more blood, but no horror. It was cheesy, instead of scary.And please--this little kid, who everyone said was so much better than the original acted the part as if he had a sign in neon on his forehead saying, "Hi, I'm the AntiChrist Kid!" Talk about telegraphing.All in all, this remake was pointless. Maybe the devil can't scare us that much anymore, but the next time I see a remake, I will certainly run for the hills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the 1976 original and forget about this crap.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Seltzer rewrote his classic 1976 screenplay, didn't change the structure and kept very much of the old dialogue, so if you know Donner's classic, please do not expect something new.I watched it yesterday (on 6-6-06, I thought this was a cool idea) and thought, "The classic was so cool and if they didn't change much, what can go wrong?" After sitting through this unintentionally funny piece of filth, I knew: EVERYTHING.Julia Stiles was not only terribly miscast (she was at least ten years too young to fit this part properly), her acting was worse than ever and made the audience laugh several times.Beltrami's score is just plain boring and pointless. One misses the perfection of Goldsmith's moody original music. The direction: poor, alarmingly poor. It seems as if the director phoned it in. A shame! Then: Liev Schreiber, a better actor than Gregory Peck? I don't think so. The supporting cast, like Thewlis, Gambon, and Farrow is practically wasted. At least Farrow could save her the one and only suspenseful scene when she kills Julia Stiles ("Thank God she's gone!") in the hospital. But then again, her performance cannot stand the comparison to Billie Whitelaw's powerful performance.If you don't know Donner's classic, this might be entertaining. If you do, this is annoying beyond belief. One of the worst remakes in movie history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Recommended For Those Who Haven't Seen The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who never saw the original, this is a good movie. It's intense, nicely photographed with excellent surround sound, and capably acted.For those of us who watched the original in 1976, the one that starred Gregory Peck and Lee Remick, we have to ask, "What is the point of watching this?" For us - at least most of us - the original is superior, but not by a wide margin, to be fair. I have no problem with remakes if they are not cheaply presented and I was entertained by this presentation even though I knew the story.As an admirer of the '76 movie, my main objection to this was the casting, and mainly with two women: Julia Stiles as "Katherine Thorn" and Mia Farrow as "Mrs. Baylock." Stiles is a competent actress but she has a face that could pass for 15 or 16. At least Lee Remick looked the part: the wife of a mid-30s American diplomat. Farrow has the same problem in here: too soft (and pretty) a face and voice to be playing an evil nurse. Perhaps Mia has a fondness for films about the devil, dating back to "Rosemary's Baby in 1968, but she was totally miscast. Billie Whitelaw, in the original version, oozed evil in her role, and was genuinely frightening, something Farrow didn't come close to being in here.Liev Schreiber, meanwhile, had the unenviable task of supplanting Gregory Peck. Schreiber can't be faulted for not having Peck's film presence, but his character in here is such a downer that he almost has an evil countenance himself. I don't remember Peck playing this character so unsympathetically. Stiles, too, has a character that wasn't as pleasing as Remick's.This film seems to emphasize the couple's lack of spiritualness more so than the previous film. I may be wrong, but I don't remember Peck going to these lengths to give his bias against religion, nor do I recall Remick wanting an abortion, nor do I remember the priest saying "I'll see you in hell, Mr. Thorn." Perhaps they did, and I just don't recall. No priest, by the way, would act like that, except in the movies, nor would any cleric look and act as goofy as the ones in here.In both films, the theology is laughable - pure Hollywood, and the priests in here are, too, being clueless about what "grace" and "the cross" are all about. Filmmakers generally won't deal with those topics, but they do a good job in making a case for Satan, I'll give them that. You saw a similar instance of this in "The Exorcist."As for the other characters, the young boy - who has no dialog - is similar to the boy in the original but a little less evil-looking and David Thewlis in this movie did an excellent job as the photographer, as did David Warner in the first movie. Overall, I thought the first film was creepier than this one, but since I was already familiar with the story prior to watching this, a comparison may be unfair.It was interesting to see this with the updated technology both off (digital surround sound, etc.) and on the screen (laptop computers, cell phones, etc.) but the story is still similar enough that owning both of these films is questionable. Given the choice, I would stick with the 1976 film, but - I repeat: if you've never seen "The Omen," this movie is recommended. It's entertaining, that's for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leave old movies alone, awful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went and saw The Omen today in my local movie theater and I wonder, why do people review this movie with such high scores? I don't see what was great about the movie, I found myself fidgeting in my chair and awaiting the end. I faintly remember the 70's version of the film but I do recall the fact that it kept me interested, it provoked me to stay watching. But unlike the older, "classic" version...the new, updated Omen is a bore and actually caused me to laugh more than jump or cringe in my seat. Sure, it had it's moments when I jumped due to the seemingly calm atmosphere and then a jolt of loud music, but besides that I was not pleased with the lack of suspense or even gore that this movie did have. A couple good bloody parts, but lacking a true horror feel.I'm not sure whether or not my movie theater just got a special version of this film or whether everyone saw it too but ignored the ever-occurring audio equipment. Was it just my group of viewers who were introduced to the large microphones being dangled over Julia Stiles' head and the bobbing black tip of the equipment at the top of the screen. I do believe that overall we got to see the audio equipment a good 10 minutes or so. It caused a good laugh and made me pay attention to the film instead of the numbness in my behind. They gave me a disclaimer for The Ring 2, but I got nothing when walking into this movie, which made it all the more amusing.So Dan Zimmerman, maybe you need to figure out how to edit a film? But looking at his list of works, he's more into the editing of a comedy film, maybe he wanted to add a little humor? Beats me. Either way, I'd go see it for a laugh if it wasn't so damn expensive to see a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad sign!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not one of these crazy people who go mental every time Hollywood remakes a movie. Such movies can be appropriate and interesting if they are brought into a contemporary setting or given a new political twist. But for every brilliant Dawn of the Dead there are a million pathetic Wicker Men or The Grudge. It's an easy, lucrative business practise but the shocking thing is how often directors screw it up when the template on how to make a good movie from the material is right there in front of them.Let me begin with saying that The Omen 2006 is, hands down, one of the worst films I have even seen in my life. Simply saying this is an understatement, I left it feeling insulted, offended and angry. But I don't want to waste energy and word-space aptly describing how wretchedly incompetent the film is at absolutely everything so we'll leave it at that.It's been over a decade since I saw the original, I was about 12 when I caught it on TV late one Saturday night. It would probably wouldn't scare me now but I was mildly freaked out by it then. With Richard Donner behind the camera you can rely on it being a strong movie regardless of the scares. Working from, more or less, the exact script, hack, nobody director John Moore hasn't got a rat-arsed clue and makes a mess of this from the very beginning.Ditching the scope-widescreen photography of the original he shoots the film in plain old 1.85:1, which would be fine if he did something slightly artistic with it. But instead he gives us the blandest cinematography possible and it looks incredibly TV-movie-ish. Which is weird considering his cheap, Wal-Mart widescreen photography in Behind Enemy Lines and Flight of the Phoenix (another remake). Every single 'scare' he has up his sleeve is no more than an amateurish, simple-minded 'stinger' which you will ALWAYS see coming because they only 'work' when they are put into a scene of total silence. So whenever there is a sudden silence in the movie, prepare for the 'boo'.I can't see any reason why any of the cast would appear in this drek other than the fat paycheck. Liev Schreiber sleepwalks his way through almost entirely monosyllabic role (or perhaps he's just a terrible actor) while surrounded by a bunch of equally stupid characters who deserve to die for being so foolish. All the slasher-movie elements are in place here eh? That's all it is.Considering the material there was so much potential for so much more. How about some insight into the inner workings of heaven and hell? How about the tiniest bit of plot logic? Where's the atmosphere? But no! They chuck it all away because their imagination and creativity cannot stretch that far and serve up yet another bog-standard, run-of-the-mill crap-fest that will only appeal to brain-dead philistines.Marco Beltrami's generic score (is this man capable of anything else?) is almost as bad Moore's direction (if you can call it that). Once again, here we have so much potential for a great score (Jerry Goldsmith knew this and won an Academy Award for the original), but you need talent to do this or care about the project instead of just being involved for the sake of food and heat. Nobody, NOBODY, from the director all the way down to the dolly grip, gave anything to this far inferior remake. It was a chore to make and a chore to sit through.Of all the terrible remakes that have come and gone in recent years (it's frightening how many there are now) this one has to be the most pointless. How stupid do they think we are? Who on earth would fall for this crap? John Moore has insulted both God AND The Devil with this garbage.I could give you 666 reasons why you shouldn't watch this movie. But I'm almost out of word-space.Beware!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite all special effect stuff available today there was nothing new - no improvement on the original film made 30 years ago? Same scares in same places. No new twists or additional scares. Ccontinuity was not good, acting was cheesy, actors waited til others had finished talking to begin their dialogue. Wooden acting - esp Mr Thorne who failed at most junctures to move his mouth. I had some credibility issues with this too. Child was scarily poor and wooden. Obviously felt he had achieved the 'scary look' which was basically all he did with no conviction at all. I was not convinced!! Very disappointing</fullReview>

The original movie is a cult classic, and of course you might ask yourself why would anybody dare to remake it? The original script is really good, and it is one of the best horror stories that have ever been told. But throwing in cheep scary clips that you might see on a Flash homepage, made to scare you for a second, it's basically just a insult to this story.I really wish there was some invention that could take me back a couple of hours in time, so i could spent this time on something more productive, like sleeping or shooting myself.I wish no one the horror of actually seeing this movie!

		<shortDescription>Disappointing and actually quite humorous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting a lot more from this movie and I was instantly disappointed. It was a mediocre attempt to bring this movie back to life. I went to the screening and throughout the movie people laughed and chuckled (not the kind of response one expects from a horror film). The only parts that "scared" people involved sudden dog barks and growls. Actually the only action in the movie involved dogs. The kid who plays Damien was disappointing; he was not intimidating like the original Damien. Julia Styles was more than disappointing; her acting was dull and half ass-ed. The movie used cliché attempts to turn it into a horror film like the typical and overused mirror scene. To add more negative aspects to the movie the plot was not well structured and weak. If you saw the original you know that Damien does not die, and the fact that in the last scene he looks back at the camera and smiles in a poor attempt to look evil gives way to maybe another horrible sequel. Even though the screening was free I felt ripped off. I was hoping at least for a great sound production like the amazing job Jerry Goldsmith did for the original and I didn't even get that. I don't want to sound bias but really I did not find one positive thing about this movie and I was looking forward for this, which only increased my disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here Comes the Son Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Portending a bad Omen, the film's promotional dialogue barks, "The prophecy is clear, the signs are unmistakable, Armageddon is upon us - and our darkest fears are revealed? as an unspeakable horror is unleashed on the world! U.S. diplomat Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber) substitutes an orphan for his own stillborn baby in order to spare his unknowing wife (Julia Stiles). But after a series of grotesque murders and dire warnings, the Thorns come to the chilling realization that their child is the son of Satan!" This is a well-produced, but uninspired re-make of the 1976 box-office revelation. After about thirty minutes, it's difficult to suppress the laughter (the scene with the Thorn family in a car, on their way to a church). Unfortunately, there aren't enough funny scenes to recommend the second coming of "The Omen" as a comedy. Casting Mia Farrow (as Mrs. Baylock) was interesting, since she so memorably provided a womb for Satan's son in the granddaddy of these films, "Rosemary's Baby".All in all, you're infinitely better off with originals, like "Rosemary's Baby" (1968) and "The Omen" (1976).** The Omen (2006) John Moore ~ Liev Schreiber, Julia Stiles, Mia Farrow</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh my God!!! What have they done?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is really terrible. It should have never been done at first place. The classic Omen(1976) is the most perfect horror film ever done. Perfect cast, perfect screenplay, and most of all a brilliant soundtrack, which carries the movie. And Richard Donner did a great job. This new Omen is too bad, a big mistake. Liev Schreiber is the only good thing in the film, but not even close to Gregory Peck. Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick is pathetic as Damien. All the time I felt like he knew exactly what he was doing. Come on!! He's a five year old kid! The scene that he's making a sandwich, in the dark, with a PSYCHO knife is the most ridiculous of all. And what about the nightmares?! Jesus!! What's that?! It made Damien look like a vampire or a psycho killer. The scariest role in the classic Omen is Mrs. Baylock, perfectly done by Billie Whitelaw, but Mia Farrow is the biggest disappointing thing in this Omen. She doesn't look bad at all. The zoo scene is awful!! People who didn't watch the classic probably will enjoy this one, it's a very well done film. But who ever watched the original, stick to it.</fullReview>

Even Liev Schrieber was boring in this, opting to go the strong silent type. Things in the movie were poorly explained, and it just dragged on and on. With people saying "boobenhagen" all the time with a straight face, I couldn't take it. The little boy just gave mean looks sometimes. Julia just tried to make herself cry as much as possible. Liev just tried to look like he was trying not to cry. And Yes, we understand all the underlying theme of red, we don't need it in our face in improbable places. My god, even the blanket at a HOSPITAL bed was a blood red satin looking sheet. The devil boys scooter had red wheels and a red handle.

		<shortDescription>Quality spooky story, better production values - a worthy remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, we often find it sad that Hollywood can't find something original to produce... but what-the-hey, how many new productions of Shakespeare's works come out every year? ...Maybe David Seltzer is not quite the same as Shakespeare (History will decide!!!) but you get my drift. It's nice that the kiddies can be brought a classic spooky-tale that they are otherwise unlikely to dig up on video, much less see on a big screen.The special effects are more convincing, the sets are less set-like, and the acting is more natural and less mannered (though I detect a bit of a Greg Peck voice/intonation imitation from Shreiber) and it's these sort of weaknesses that can distance today's audiences.This is really the best sort of remake - keeping all the best elements from the original without over-reaching to take the material in some other direction for the sake of being different, or without over-flexing today's FX muscles. There's a slight updating of the premise amid current world events but it's brief, welcome and not over-labored.The cast is first-rate. How great to see the best of British (David Thewlis, Michael Gambon, Pete Postlethwaite) and American (Julia Stiles is always good, though sometimes chooses poor material) young hot things and older, stately actors having a ball (Mia Farrow is very effective - playing very much against type).The creepy kid does good creepy too.I liked it. It's not horror so much as spooky, and that's no bad thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another pointless remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most of the horror loving community, the news that British classic The Omen was to suffer an Americanised remake wasn't welcome, but I figured I'd give it a fair chance anyway. As usual with remakes, I now wish I hadn't as all this film does is remind me of how good the original is. Indeed, there is nothing that the remake has over the original and all it is offers is a tired retelling of a very good story. The plot hasn't been changed, but the film does offer some new ideas, all of which are misplaced and don't work well - bringing the two towers into it being a case in point. Anyway, the plot focuses on Robert Thorn, the British ambassador and a man who unwittingly takes on the Devil's child after his own died at birth. A few odd events later and Thorn becomes convinced by various parties that Damien is the devil's spawn and so sets off to get some daggers to kill him with.The cast is one of the most annoying things about this remake. Liev Schreiber is a poor successor to the brilliant Gregory Peck, while the likes of Julia Stiles, Mia Farrow Michael Gambon and Pete Postlethwaite all fail to impress in their respective roles. The kid that they've got to play Damien isn't menacing at all, and this is a huge dent in the film as this is an important role that the audience must believe is the root of all evil. The film has none of the atmosphere of the original, and the glossy cinematography does the plot line no favours. The over the top death scenes were a big part of the 1976 classic, but here they suffer from the same problem as the rest of the film - that being the fact that they're well known now and so don't have the power that they did in the original. A lot of the people that see this won't have seen the original, but for those of us that have watching this remake is an excruciating waste of time. The original Omen received a couple of pretty terrible sequels, but not one of them (not even Omen IV) are even half as bad as this crappy effort. Overall, I can't recommend this film to anyone - fans of the original will hate it for not living up to the standard, and those that haven't seen the original will hate it because it's just so poor. Don't bother, is my advice to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood must be really short of ideas in the past decade . Not satisfied with bombarding us with sequels for films that didn't deserve to be produced in the first place they add insult to injury by remaking films that hold a lot of affection with the general public . You can understand the thinking behind this . Hollywood studios are in the money making business , not the affection business and if a film flops such as GET CARTER or EDGE OF DARKNESS then people will quickly forget the remake while still holding the original source material in high regard . THE OMEN from 1976 is a film I hold in high regard and is much better than THE EXORCIST . But even so it seems fundamentally wrong for it to get a modern treatment . Even worse it's a straight forward scene by scene remake at that The only real differences between the original and this poor version is the opening ten minutes . A committee is the Vatican muse over a comet in the sky and how it ties in with The Book Of Revelation . Cut to footage of 9/11 , Space shuttles exploding etc and you feel you're watching a film featuring Nostradamus and his shoehorned predictions rather than a film about the son of Satan . A few minutes later we're shown an American ambassador being killed in a car crash involving a petrol tanker and a cigarette end that'll have to scratching your head asking " If there's a petrol tanker crushing the left side door of the limo why didn't the Ambassador escape by getting out of the right side door ? " . After this dumb but original scene the film then exactly mirrors the original screenplay by David Seltzer as Ambassador Robert Thorn finds that his secretly adopted son carries an unworldly curse I can't emphasize enough how lazy and plageristic this version of a classic horror film is . If you've seen the 1976 version this no reason to watch this one . Everything plays out as it did previously 30 years earlier . The original nanny commits suicide by jumping off a roof with a noose around her neck , a priest who warns Thorn about his son is killed by a spire during a thunderstorm etc etc . The only real embellished scene is where a character is killed by having their hospital drip interfered with rather than getting thrown out of a hospital window . Director John Moore tries to fool the audience by using an intensified continuity - ie MTV style - directing style but this leaves the audience with a headache . At least the original had atmosphere . This version doesn't The plagiarism even extends to the extent of the performances . David Thewlis plays photographer Keith Jennings and plays the role exactly how David Warner did in the original . Pete Postelthwaite channels Patrick Troughton as Father Brennan while Michael Gambon clones Leo McKern as Bugenhagen . In fact if it wasn't for the inept directing I thought Bugenhagen's initial appearance had been spliced in from the original film . It really shows how bad things are when the wikipedia has a page dedicated to pointing out the differences between both versions such as the original had rottweilers as devil dogs while the remake has black Alsatians . . I've said it before so i'll say it again for the benefit of hard of thinking Hollywood producers - If you can't make your own film then don't bother</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's just say I finally decided to register myself on the IMDb just to let people out there know this movie was really, really boring.I knew it was based on the original Omen-movie, but I thought the story would be told from a different angle, seeing all those eerie images from the trailer: Damien being born, fast forward to the future, when the earth has succumbed to evil, man turned against man, lots of hell fire,...But nooooo... In fact, it was just a boring remake (duplicate) of the original. In the whole, it was not scary at all. OK, there were 4 - no, 2! - moments I was startled a bit. But come to think of it, that was just because of the accompanying sudden, deafening blasts of noise. (An analogy: a nice relaxing walk in the park, the birds are whistling, the sky is blue... and suddenly some brat jumps out behind a tree and scares the hell out of you) The movie itself was plain, boring, slow,...

		<shortDescription>One word sums up this remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blatant. Omen 2006 is too up front with Damien Thorne's agenda. He too obviously appears to be controlling others. Both the trailer &amp; 1976 film messed with my mind from beginning to end. Every time original Damien is on screen, could and did attribute his doings, interpret his thought processes in many ways, consistently overriding both were those persistent doubts of who he really is. What little kid unafraid of dogs would not wave at one? His mother shielded him from observing the suicide so it could be easily assumed he didn't know or was too young to grasp what had happened. Even in the famous freak out seeing church scene could and did also interpret as a full-blown tantrum; by going to church he forfeits a favorite dessert his nanny had promised he'd get immediately. What kid would not opt on loosing it failing to get his/her way? The original Damien is just as quiet but also looks innocuously cute, other than 2 scenes indiscriminately smiles. During the monkey's attack at his "mother" Katherine's car he acts as a normal child shifting between both scared &amp; gleeful. 1976 "darling's" final smile at the end is sinister as it either indicates he knows what he is or has caught some kid with his parents at the burial behind him making faces.The directors handling of 2006 Damien Thorne is a disaster. Devil's tool or blood-thirsty alien undercover, this boy is straight up scary hence no ambiguously messing with the mind. The seemingly normal child really a monster so essential to the story is yanked out this version also removes the story's essence. He's not happily biding his time for claiming the world as his dessert for a while, (double mean, too, the use of a while) nor hiding behind his cuteness, he's worked up into sulking as what he feels he deserves is not coming fast enough. Would it be too much to ask to make him appear normal child pleasant a little more? He never smiles; his one line bears foreboding as thick as a knife digging in a can of frosting. The original Omen's air of menace stemmed from my veering between can this cute mini-moppet smile-fest could or can't he be evil's embodiment?Forgot he was a foster child for a little bit before Brennan visits Ambassador Thorne. 1976 Damien also had some resemblance to leads Remick &amp; Peck.The 2006 Damien looks like neither parent nor does either "parent" show parental love towards him. Remick's shielding Damien over her shoulder when his nanny killed herself is near the top of the 1976 movie's indelible images. This is her son in her mind and we pity her cause we've been apprised earlier that he's not what he seems. The cuddle she gives him before his church tantrum is mother love typical, making his freak out all the more upsetting. Don't Schrieber or Stiles seem already afraid of this kid before the 5th b'day? Who wouldn't be, this kid continuously carries a chip on his shoulder.This is a remake right; its psychological terrors, the double meaning of scenes involving the pivotal Damien character has been yanked out replaced by obsolete shock effects an amateur horror movie-maker would cringe at the notion of putting to use. The bulk of the scares are the reenactments of the 1976's Omen's deaths.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why does Hollywood continue to remake movies that are at best a joke. It's just horrible, even trying to stay somewhat close to the original but cutting corners and falling short. The Kid isn't convincing, the Parents are convincing (Julia Stiles is 25 for pete's sake), and Mia Farrow is more like Mother Hubbard. When she kills off the Mother (and not sticking to the original kill mind you) even with security right outside the door, you know they would hear something, if not for the fact that all of that equipment the mother was hooked up to is directly linked in all hospitals to the nurses station. When the father and photographer go back to the Hospital in Rome where Damian was born they were told that it burned down 5 days ago. They were standing in the very spot where it once stood (5 days ago mind you) it hand already been cleared and paved over (in 5 days) HUH? Makes NO SENSE!!! Note to Hollywood...we are not dumb What are you going to re-make next? Gone With The Wind? Wizard Of Oz?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very dull movie. They did tighten up a couple of the classic action scenes. The "Monkey House" attack and the legendary "Cemetery Ambush" scene ("who let the dogs out?")were actually much more exciting. But the casting was so bad and the acting so weak that the film felt like a lifeless shadow of the original.Julia Stiles as Satan's mom! How about Satan's baby-sitter? She looks about sweet sixteen all the way through this turkey, and when she tries to show fragile and delicate emotions of terror she just looks sulky, like a grounded prom queen. ("I have to baby sit the devil's spawn again?") She really has strong sexual chemistry with Liev Schrieber, but it's the wrong kind of chemistry. Not so much, "darling, I can't go on," but more like, "Gee, Mr. Schreiber, I'll do anything to pass Senior Physics. I mean um, anything!" She's a luscious Lolita but a laughable leading lady.Liev Schrieber is probably a better actor than Gregory Peck, but he lacks a certain gravitas. He would have been better cast as Jennings, the sleazy photographer . . . he's an actor who works best in the gray area between right and wrong. He'd be more likely to cut a deal with Satan than panic because the devil's child is in the house. The big fight scene with Mrs. Blaylock is much weaker than the original. Gregory Peck went for broke, and played it as a saloon-style Western brawl, kicking and eye-gouging like he was fighting for right at the OK Corral. Liev Schrieber plays it more like a slap-fight between a couple of blue-haired yentas in Miami Beach. ("Oooh, I'm gonna give you such a hit!") One final thought -- why does the Vatican have an "official" telescope to watch the heavens? Don't they know that the sun moves around the earth?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to get into the worst mood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning, this comment 'contains spoiler'! First of all I am not comparing this remake with the original, and I am not reviewing the movie separately from the plot. Let's just say that the movie and the plot are one single peace you can not separate and I'm describing the feelings and impression You might get while watching this movie if you didn't see the original.It's like trying to support your favorite football/baseball/whatever team during their most important game while you don't know that someone have cut off one leg from each of the players. You see that something is going wrong, they are loosing, you are still hoping for a miracle and ... at the last moment of the game you realize that you were really naive to hope for something because ... your favorite team members do not have one leg !!! they did not have a chance of winning, that's why the game is over and they lost 10/0 or 100/0.In the movie, main characters are realistic, positive, developed enough to make you really care for what is going to happen to them (good playing). The bad side is so cool, professional, efficient while the positive characters are so slow, doing so many mistakes, often lame. And in the end - they all fail, they all die without having a chance of winning, achieving no results.VanHelsing is not my favorite #1 but man ... wasting 2 hours on worries for 2 losers that die in the end makes me really angry. I don't know what feelings/conclusions/mood I should come out with after watching this film according to the plans of the movie makers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is this so bad and the original considered quite good?I think the major reason is that the original was made in a gentler cinematic age, when a child with an evil look could spook you. And the dad being Scout's father too. It could work. There was absolutely no humor in it either.This one has a few elements that tell you right away that it doesn't take itself seriously. The two most egregious are the casting of Rosemary as the nanny, and there's a few Rube Goldberg "Final Destination" inspired grisly deaths as if the devil's job were to entertain us.But for me, this carries no fright because its obvious that the filmmakers don't believe in the devil. Done the road from me is Pat Robertson's film school, a billion dollar affair, tuned to making Christian filmmakers. They don't yet make competent films, but they will some day. Even the incompetent films from true believers can be startling sometimes. That's because when you see a movie from them where there is a battle with the devil, you know they believe the film itself to be part of the same battle.You have none of that feel here.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Crap Director Named Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Moore should not be allowed direct any more - unless it's a corporate in-house film for MacDonalds that most of us will never have to see. Like "Flight of the Phoenix", Moore brings nothing new to this film; I know the term is 'remake', but, still, one should at least try to bring something beyond the bland style Moore brings to a film that had amazing remake potential.I'd feel ashamed at Moore being Irish if there weren't truly talented Irish directors (Sheridan, Jordan, et. al).Maybe if he took some inspiration from his film and sold his soul to the devil he might get some talent as remuneration. Or maybe he should go back to directing commercials.Mia Farrow is the one saving grace of the film. I just hope Moore isn't tempted into remaking and tainting "Rosemary's Baby".Alternative trailer for this film - Katherine Thorne, palpably distressed, whispers: 'Don't let him make any more films...'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fair but will never match the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It does seem like Hollywood is running out of ideas and, to cover themselves, they have turned to churning out remakes of old classics. As it is, this film is one of the better remakes in recent times. Based on the 1976 film, 'The Omen' sees Robert Thorn, the American ambassador to Britain, taking in an orphaned baby to take the place of his stillborn son. However, he and his wife Kate remain unaware their new 'child' Damien is the Antichrist. As Damien grows from infancy to childhood, evidence starts to mount of Damien's satanic origins and the Thorns are forced to face the truth.The acting isn't on par with the original. Liev Schreiber makes a good effort as Robert Thorn but he doesn't have the same sense of paternal love and devotion of Gregory Peck's Thorn, who left you feeling his turmoil at the thought his beloved son could be a monster. Julia Stiles tries her best in her role of Kate Thorn but she is just far too young to play mother to a seven-year-old when she looks barely out of high school herself. She was completely miscast and came across more as Damien's harassed elder sister than his mother. The member of the cast who shone out was Mia Farrow as Mrs. Baylock, Damien sinister nanny sent from Hell to protect him.'The Omen' is an enjoyable enough film but it doesn't strike out as really being worth the money spent on remaking it when it offers nothing new aside from being glossier. It doesn't help that what worked in 1976 doesn't work in 2006, where viewers are more discerning. The British media doesn't care what the American ambassador is up to (not when there are cheap celebrities to be stalking) nor could I see this ambassador receiving a police escort when it makes more sense that discretion is the better option. And it is almost impossible to walk into a hospital ICU and kill someone what with CCTV and monitor telemetry hooked up to the nurses' desk. They have made Damien more outwardly creepier, and wee moppet Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick does rise to the occasion in the role, but surely the Devil has enough brains to ensure his son seems so innocent and sweet that no-one would ever suspect who he is. Damien might well have been wearing a sign saying 'I'm Satan Junior' with the way the character is portrayed. And why does a child raised in the UK have an American accent? He might have American 'parents' but he mixes in school with British children (hence why it made sense for a British child to take the role in the classic version). And I can't emphasise enough how much Jerry Goldsmith's legendary 'Ave Satani' soundtrack is missed.Overall, it is a better film than other remakes and it passes the time if there is little else on television but if you want proper Gothic horror stick with the Seventies original or, if it's psychotic children you wish you see, check out 'Joshua' or 'The Bad Seed'.</fullReview>

The dad was the best of the group. Actually, strike that. The dogs were better.As a remake, it sucked.The story would be good, as the original was.The scare scenes. They could of been better. But instead they just optioned to put loud sounds of statics or someone else yelling. As a friend of mine said, they probably put that the yelling sounds because they knew that no one else would be scared yelling. I did get surprised at one point, but only because I started talking to a friend and all the sudden the static/yell noise came up and "Woah! There's a dog!" Oh, and almost every scare was just someone jumping on someone's back or seeing something in the mirror from over the shoulder.All in all, I wish I had seen "the Core", now #2 on my worst movies ever list, instead of watching this horrible movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jazzier violence, otherwise pointless...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's almost impossible to discuss this remake of the 1976 thriller without constantly comparing the two versions--it's a very basic updating, using much of the same screenplay and yet upping the ante on the violence (for that extra, "Final Destination"-like kick). An American Ambassador and his wife living in England find the behavior of their young child Damien strange and foreboding, while the husband hides the secret he exchanged the baby at an Italian hospital when theirs was allegedly stillborn and yet another child was orphaned at birth. Doomsday thriller wasn't exactly a masterpiece back in '76 but did have a chilly look and atmosphere, terrific lead actors, and even a little boy who--with very few lines--managed to convey an eerie impertinence with his expressions. This kid is a vacant, heavy-lidded, older-seeming child who looks too lanky to be carted around in his mother's arms (he seems like an extra from a Goth-rock music video); as the Thorns, Julia Stiles and Liev Schreiber have the opposite problem--they're too young. Stiles in particular fails to convince as a political wife; she tries for an authoritative presence, but she's neither this nor the motherly type--she's just playing dress-up. Mia Farrow is interesting as the boy's evil nanny, but this version has her feeding the boy chunks of meat (what??) and playing goody-two-shoes with the hospital staff that drains all the immediacy out of the suspense. Quite lackluster overall, mismanaged from the outset and not very scary. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish But Inferior Remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in seeing "The Omen" remake today without many expectations, and for me the movie was okay. It is basically the same plot as the original, and almost everything in the film was the same besides some additions and changes here and there.Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber) is an American ambassador, and his wife, Katharine (Julia Stiles), has a miscarriage. Instead of breaking the news to her, Robert exchanges his dead son for a baby born that morning whose mother died in childbirth. Katharine will never know, and they can raise the son as their own. But on little Damian's 6th birthday, his nanny commits suicide in front of the entire party, and a strange replacement nanny named Mrs. Baylock (Mia Farrow) arrives. As a priest tries to warn Robert of his dangerous son, a reporter teams up with Robert and they together try and determine Damian's origins, for they believe he is the son of the Devil, and they must hurry before more lives are lost and the Antichrist takes over.Considering this was a remake, it really wasn't that bad. When I saw Julia Stiles was playing Katharine in this film, I was a little skeptical, but she gave a pretty good performance. Hardcore fans of the original film may want to dismiss this a terrible remake of an excellent film, but the two movies really aren't different - they're nearly the same, besides the new actors and modern day settings. They really stuck to the original here. The deaths were a little bloodier, and the settings much more elaborate, which was nice. I thought the release date (06/06/06) was kind of clever, and I'm sure the box office will pull in plenty for this film (at least for today) considering that it's being released the same day all across the world, and how the release date relates to the content of the film.In my opinion, this was alright for a remake, and I enjoyed it for the most part. It doesn't live up to the original, but it was a worthy effort. Some fans of the original "Omen" may appreciate this, some may not. But definitely see the original before you watch this, that way you can compare the two. It could have been worse. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In these unimaginative times we live in... this is what you get : A duplicate of the first movie with IDENTICAL scenes and a different art director and photographer (or composer). TCSM(2004/5) was lame, butgristly remade. Sharing economical traits, Halloween(2008/9) was lame,but decently remade. The Hills have Eyes was lame, but brutally remade. Dawn of the Dead was near perfect, if somewhat better than the original. The Omen, on the other hand, is a remake gone bad. Watch a movie you know and watch it remade, and see just how little this generation has to offer to movie-making. The only dark times I saw in this movie was the appalling lack of novelty, poetry and tension the original was known to deliver. What happened to Rosemary's Baby, the Ninth Gate or Angel Heart?? Americans are sinking in conservatism even more than Europeans have...God not save us from the Antichrist, but from overly formatted MTV'esquire "films".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A pretty tired remake of the original; admittedly they had a very hard act to follow but didn't really even start to live up to it.Quite apart from the film merely following the original scene for scene but with less impressive actors was the state of the locations. The original was actually filmed in London but in the remake they substituted Prague for London. One European city may look like another if you've never been East of the Mississippi but if you actually live here it just made the whole thing look like a joke.The American Embassy was suddenly transported from Grosvenor Square (a leafy tree-lined square built up on all sides) to the south bank of the Thames with big open views across the river.And somehow we were supposed to believe that Prague's cathedral, the tramlines and overhead cables and traffic lights were supposed to be central London?

		<shortDescription>Doesn't match up to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was 1976. The Omen was released in cinemas worldwide and was to become one of the greatest horror movies ever made. Then, 30 years later, some idiot came up with the idea of remaking it for a modern audience. "Oh God", most people thought., and they were right. Leiv Schreiber stars as Robert Thorn, whose wife, Catherine, (Julia Stiles) loses her child whilst giving birth. Robert is approached by a priest, who suggests that he adopt an orphan (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) and not tell his wife of the dead child. However, 5 years later Robert regrets this decision when he begins to suspect that the boy, Damien, is the son of the Devil.I'm going to admit that I do respect the makers of this film due to the amount of guts they must have had in order to do this. But, this doesn't mean it wasn't a stupid decision. The original Omen was such a great film that it was almost impossible for the remake to match it, and I know how they thought they could do this: taking every scene from the original and just changing it slightly. However, this technique doesn't work, and makes it very unoriginal and incredibly predictable by those who have seen the 1976 version.The film isn't really very scary either. The only way it manages to scare its audience is by making a sudden change in decibel level. Ooooh, scary! The original had a spooky atmosphere which is what made it a great movie, but the remake fails terribly to do this.However, I did actually like Leiv Schreiber in his performance, although I still prefer Gregory Peck from the original. Schreiber is a genuinely good actor and he did a great job in lifting this movie up and getting it a couple more marks. Julia Stiles is also on excellent form as Schreiber's wife, as is David Thewlis as the photographer. Also, Seamus Davey Fitzpatrick is pretty damn good at, well, looking creepy as hell.What I think the writer should have done is do a re-imagining rather than a frame-by-frame remake. This worked perfectly for Rob Zombie's remake of John Carpenter's Halloween and it probably would have benefited The Omen. This would have made it a lot more original and given the writer a lot more creative freedom rather than just copying the 1976 version.Even as a stand-alone movie, The Omen is still pretty average. Then again, if it wasn't for the original, it would probably be slightly better, but only slightly.It most definitely isn't as good as the 1976 version, but The Omen does boast good performances from Leiv Schreiber and Julia Stiles. I give it 6/10.</fullReview>

I suppose Liev Shreiber and Julia Stiles were always up against it when being compared to Gregory Peck and Lee Remick.For me the biggest mistake they made was not using 'ave satani' during the film.

		<fullReview>Okay, nowhere near as good as the 1976 original. So what was wrong? The faults:-1) The actor playing Damien was given too much dialogue, was sinister from the start but ultimately not the least bit scary.2) The lack of a Jerry Goldsmith music score which really made the first film so wonderfully terrifying.3) The actors playing the Thorns - dreadful miscasting and the looked as though they couldn't have cared less.4) Mia Farrow as Mrs Baylock - nowhere near menacing enough. Actually, she was on a par with Mary Poppins.5) Having the nanny who hanged herself slump against the wall instead of crashing through a window, something which made her death in the original so truly horrifying.What worked:- 1) The decapitation sequence was superbly staged and definitely on a level with the original.2) The priest's death was also extremely effective and nicely crafted.3) The first dogs were electrifyingly good.So, in summary, more bad points than plus points. It need never have been remade. Hopefully they'll stop at this and there won't be an OMEN II remake to follow.Peter Benassi, Scotland, UK.</fullReview>

Actually, I don't even know if there were supposed to be any scary moments in the movie. There was no suspense, no fear. Some of it barely even made sense, and the parts that did make sense were incredibly boring and predictable. Walking into the theater (not when buying the tickets) there were employees checking ID, that would normally indicate that if nothing else, the movie would at least be gory, but this was not. The few deaths that did occur you could see coming from a mile away.It gave me a good laugh here and there (especially the "strawberries" scene), but mostly it just wasted my night.

		<fullReview>Having seen this movie just last night, I thought it would be prudent that I deliver a review of The Omen to you, Without spoilers, as a Public Service Announcement.6 6 6? More like Sucks , Sucks , Sucks!I went into this movie with high expectations, and I came out with a bucketful of disappointment. The acting was, in general, shoddy, with Liev Schreiber doing his best to convey exactly zero emotion, even in scenes when he was supposed to be emotional, and Julia Stiles manages to wander aimlessly through the role of mother, congealing into an actual actress just long enough to frightfully whisper the words they put into the commercials: "Don't let him kill me." It was the high point of her performance. The shining star of the film turned out to be Mia Farrow, conveying creepy exuberance like that ancient aunt your parents made you visit as a child, who never left her bed, and who always smelled of peppermints and ointment... As for the Antichrist himself? Young Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick could be the next big actor, but you couldn't tell in this movie, because his sole job was to stand around with dark circles under his eyes and stare at people. Oh, and at monkeys. I think maybe he did something interesting a couple of times, but by that time I was bored and/or angry at the movie as a whole.What made it worse were the director's attempts to scare you with cheap theatrics. Every time something popped up on the screen that was intentionally there to scare us, the audience laughed at it. Every time. I could have sworn I was watching a parody of the movie I loved as a child. But no, they meant it, and that made it even funnier. The whole thing failed to scare. I could write a scarier poem about the Antichrist? To sum things up, bad remake. Bad, bad remake. Shame on you, 20th Century Fox.</fullReview>

You would at least think they would throw a few differences in here or there however they never deviated from the original at all. It was like seeing the same film however back then it was interesting, had some passion and a sense of mystery. This film captured not even a drop.When I say wait for DVD, thats if your bored to death and have a self wasted sense of curiosity, I can see that. Yet to pay money to see something that is the substandard on all levels of something you've seen many times before, then your just dishing yourself up for some aggravated disappointment.Beware my friend, beware.

		<fullReview>Well, here it is. Another excuse for a remake that went horribly wrong somewhere along the tracks. This is another stupid and pathetic Hollywood excuse for a movie that never takes off the ground as much as people may think or believe it does. A selection of good actors given a stupid and boring script that is a basic scene-for-scene remake of the original blockbuster; not that the original was the greatest movie ever made by any respects. The whole story is pointless and doesn't cover any new ground that the original didn't handle well. The direction is good for a period and there is a sense of intrigue and suspense along the way, that is again upset by stupid and pointless scares and gore that add nothing to the movie. Liev Schreider is a poor excuse for Gregory Peck, even not looking at the original he does a pretty bad job. And a missed opportunity for Mia Farrow. This could have put her back on the books with the connection of this film and her greatest ever role in 'Rosemary's Baby'. Shame on the casting agencies who agreed to have the child actor who looks like the kid from 'The Ring' and would freak anyone walking past him on the street. Trust me guys, you may think there is some saving power in this film, there just isn't!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Omen bucks the trend for poor remakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In recent years we have been subjected to some very poor horror remakes including 2005's anaemic remake of the Amityville horror and this years poorly crafted The Hills Have eyes. Now also consider Gus Van Sants uninteresting interpretation of Phsyco and the totally abysmal Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, and you could be forgiven for thinking this years remake of The Omen is one to miss. Helmed by John Moore, the man responsible for the excellent Owen Wilson war film Behind enemy lines and last years forgettable The Flight of the phoenix remake, The Omen is given no new twists are turns and stays very faithful to the original.This no doubt will be viewed by some as a weakness, and the film then considered a pointless exercise, but for me and hopefully many more this actually made the film a more interesting experience. It used the same story and instead of the 70's it places itself in modern times and explores many new perspectives on religion and even at times touches on politics to.The Story as mentioned above is nearly turn for turn a carbon copy of the original. Liev Screiber plays an ambassador who leaves to go to London with his Wife and son Damien. However after a series of terrible events and some weird photos it becomes clear that Damien could be the Devil incarnate.The cast is certainly a lot stronger than most horror films can boast and it does become apparent when characters interact. Instead of getting cardboard conversations and paper thin personality's here we get offered that bit more, and it really does improve the quality of the film. Liev Screiber and Julia Stiles both play well as Damiens parents, and in scenes of peril, particularly Stiles they both come up trumps in conveying their terror. Support is really good in this movie with David Thewlis, Mia Farrow and Pete Postletwaite all delivering spooky and hammy turns in abundance, and in fact rivalling the original films cast, particularly Farrow who is great value in the form of Mrs Baylock Damiens Nanny. As for Damien himself little Seamus Davey Fitzpatrick is clearly not a brilliant actor but his eyes and stare are so malevolent you get a chill whenever he appears, and that is fine for the role.Moore has injected plenty of menace and boo moments into the film, so as to keep the audience alert. There are some genuinely scary set pieces and all the deaths are fun and gruesome in equal measure. Fun is an important word, and a film like this needs to have plenty of it, and thats maybe why it succeeds like it does. The end suggests that Moore and co definitely gave the politics of today a thought as the presidents head, are rather the back of his head looks a lot like George Bush. The beginning of the film is my only criticism. I understand why it is there, the sequence at the vatican involving all the disasters to try and add something new, but this was well enough made to stand on its own two feet and thus doesn't need the ill judged opening as an excuse for its existence.My final verdict is The Omen is a well made film and well worth seeing for a new look at religion are politics. Or if you want fun and a guys head getting chopped of it works well to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie of All Time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are thinking about seeing the new Omen remake DON'T waste your money or your time on this one. The movie is HORRIBLE. It was so bad I had to write about it here in hopes to prevent others from wasting their time. It was obviously rushed into production and the audience was actually laughing at the horrible flubs in it. It starts out OK, classic horror movie style. Then comes the boom mic.... and it alone destroys the entire film. If you don't know what a boom mic is, it is the microphone that is on a long pole held over the actors heads to pick up dialog. Well this thing is in 90% of ALL talking scenes. I'm not even joking... this mic shows up EVERYWHERE. Its pathetic. And its not just the little microphone tip that barely shows or something like that. Its the entire thing in some shots. There is one shot where the mic and ENTIRE length of the pole is clearly shown. When it first appeared I thought...hmmm are there reporters in this scene or is that just a little flub? No... the camera pans back, no reporters in sight. Must have just been a mistake. I figured it was a small mistake. But then, it appears in the next scene, and the next scene, and the NEXT scene, and then in almost every single scene from that point on. At one point it almost HIT the actresses head while she's sitting on the couch yelling at the nanny to take Damien upstairs. It got so bad that you could tell the producers even tried cutting it out of some scenes. Suddenly this dark (and sometimes uneven) black fuzzy line appears at the top of the screen attempting to hide the mic. Unfortunately even the black fuzzy line couldn't keep this thing out of the shot. It dips down below the line many many times. How do you take a horror movie seriously when the microphone is in all the shots?? That wasn't the only mistake. There are numerous scenes where they pan up in Damien's home and you can clearly see scaffolding and scene construction including the lights. Its like they didn't care that you could see the entire set. They certainly weren't going for realism. Aside from the horrible rushed production the movie was OK. It wasn't all that scary. It had more of that "something jumps out at you/surprises you" scare factor. I admit I jumped once myself, but aside from that one jolt, the movie really didn't freak me out. It was lame. I would give it 1 star and that's being generous. It was such a bad movie that it definitely ranks within my top 3 worst movies ever list. I almost walked out of this one. To be honest, by the end I wish I had walked out. The only thing I took away was the fact that I saw the worst produced movie ever. Never in my life have I seen the boom mic so many times and I don't believe I ever will again (hopefully!) That at least gives me something to talk about so that's where the 1 star comes into play. The only horror about this film was the fact that the producer has to live with his name attached to such a crappy movie forever. (And lets hope the boom mic operator was fired and career ruined) Horrible, horrible movie. Don't waste your time and don't waste your money! If you don't heed this warning and go anyway, I'll bet you the cost of your ticket that you will be thinking of me before its over and wishing you listened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake of the Gregory Peck/Lee Remick original is a point-by-point event-by-event facelift of a finely chilling movie that in no way needs remaking and which is best left alone. Neither the script, producers nor the director find anything remotely fresh to wring from the story arc, whose execution is drably formulaic, a somnambulistic walkthrough of the original film's script. The considerable abilities of Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles never take flight because of no opportunities to do so. "The Omen" 2006 is told with no conviction and no enthusiasm, with also-ran shooting and editing. It's the most phoned-in waste-of-time film I have seen in several years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"it's all for..." Nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best part was knowing that nearly everyone was going to die. The filmmakers took the worst aspects of the original film and based their film around them. There are the same existing plot holes from the original (like if it's the end of the world and only the Catholics knew it, why did't they send backup to the one man who has to kill his adopted son?), but none of the great creepiness. One of the most jaw-dropping moments of the original were attempted to be recreated for this film, but unfortunately really just missed the mark. A prime example of this being the suicide of the nanny. That scene was incredibly realistic and powerful in the original, as was the dynamic between mother and nanny. The remake covered it briefly, and while I see what they were trying to do with it, it fell flat. The actors were terrible for the most part, especially the entire Thorn family. I could actually see Liev Schreiber's Robert Thorn being able to kill his child because Schreiber himself cannot portray personality or emotions. Immediately when seeing Julia Stiles I had to frantically reassure myself that she would be the first of the Thorn family to die. Most disappointing was Damien. There is just no way to compete with the equal amounts of innocent and creepiness of the child from the original film, but this little boy did not even come close. The best part was Mia Farrow, and it was obvious that she would be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails to capture any of the originals magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It doesn't help that the original is one of my all time favourite films but I found this a total disappointment.I think if a classic is going to be remade then they should try to approach it in a different kind of way but this copies the original virtually scene for scene.That leads to inevitable comparisons.The most obvious is the acting in which Schrieber and Styles deliver shockingly wooden performances.I actually thought it was laughable in places.Whereas Peck and Remick had a chemistry that made the audience genuinely care for them it's almost impossible to give a damn about the leads in the remake.The other main difference is what,to be fair,very few horror films (especially modern ones) seem to capture and that's atmosphere.The original had a very eerie feel to it,helped in no small part to Jerry Goldsmith,but it just wasn't there at all in the remake.On the plus side Farrow and Postlethwaite are decent. A fair argument with remakes is to try and forget the original and just take the remake on its own merits but it just falls short in so many ways for me personally. If an upcoming film maker wanted to learn lessons on how to make a good horror film they should watch the original and then the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See the Original Instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Virtual scene-for-scene remake of the 1976 Omen film with the 21st century music video gloss that passes for cinematography now. That this was made by the same director who would later do the awful Max Payne and A Good Day to Die Hard should come as no surprise. John Moore is a director more focused on making a film look good than actually be good.Did The Omen need to be remade? Of course not but such is the nature of the business. Before I start going on a diatribe about that, I'd better get back to this film and what's good or bad about it. What's good: some nicely staged scenes, but nothing particularly creative or original. For a director so obsessed with visuals, Moore offers little to improve upon the original's film's creative death set pieces. He just copies them. How creatively bankrupt is this man? As for the bad: the movie is plodding, unoriginal, often boring with no suspense or scares worth mentioning. Will viewers unfamiliar with the original film feel the same way? I think so unless these viewers are just generally unfamiliar with movies altogether. The cast is nothing to write home about. Julia Stiles tries and Liev Schrieber is dull as mud. Mia Farrow does fine with a performance that, judging by some of the praise I've seen, is a tad overrated.Overall, it's yet another misfire remake of a superior film. Do yourself a favor and see the original instead. If you already have seen the original, watch something else. Something new or something old you haven't seen before. Just not another crappy horror remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An equally bad remake of the 1976 original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read reviews that call this remake dull and not scary. I completely agree, but the same can be said of the 1976 original. Although the book was based on the movie, I read it before watching either film and thoroughly enjoyed it. Which made this drab and uneventful film even more disappointing. I did find the more modern adaptation of the film slightly more enjoyable than the first, but both are still incredibly boring. It shouldn't even be classified as a horror film, there is nothing scary or even suspenseful about the film. Its really more of a drama. I am not an avid reader, but believe me when I say the book (even though based on the original movie) is a far better experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one is exceptionally slick for a remake but also one that made me throw up in the movie theater. The scenes in the remake are over the top graphic and they had to cut them out on the WGN showing of The Omen. This one is up there with the original with how scary it is -- everything about the film is strong but not perfect.It is a word for word remake but the death of the mother is different in the remake and that is all I am giving you about that, you have to figure it out for yourself about how the mother dies. That is not the ending though, I am not going to give that away though -- the mother's death is a spoiler in terms of one of the deaths in the movie, so I am just going to give that detail.The movie version of the original she dies from falling out of the hospital. The hospital death is a little different. The movie is all in all chilling but very graphic and vomit inducing in parts -- I normally don't have that reaction to horror films but this one gave me that reaction. The room mate got some vomit on her leg from when I threw up in the movie theater, I saw this on the premiere of the film on 6-6-06. It was worth every penny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was not suspenseful in the least. I didn't get to the end because I was so bored. Maybe had I not seen the original version, I might have appreciated this one more. However, sitting there for the 50 minutes or so before I decided that I'd had enough and stopped watching, I had the sense that I was simply being led through very familiar territory. The only reason to watch this is to see the still beautiful Mia Farrow chew up the screen during the, too brief, scenes that she has as nanny to "Evil Incarnate." As for "Evil Incarnate"? Sorry, having seen tykes in action, the Damien in this sorry recast of the much better original comes off as no more evil than your run-of-the-mill pouty eight-year-old having a bad day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Omen (Origional) Is one of my favourite movies of all time and I really don't feel like it needed to be re-made. I admit some bits in the original are a bit shabby. I thought the impaling scene was more realistic in the remake. In the original the priest just stands there waiting to be impaled. But in the remake it caught him by surprise. I thought that Damien in the remake looks more evil than Damien in the original. He looks to cute to be the son of the devil in the original. Lol. Those are the only two points that I thought were better in the remake. I feel like they tried to make it a horror thats visually scary and a typical horror that rely on typical horror stuff. But the original was a psychological horror that really made you think. I mean, this stuff is predicted in the bible! Thats the scariest part.I think eventually people are going to run out of ideas for horrors so everything will be re-made... I really hope that doesn't happen! Writers need to start digging deeper than pointless gore and slasher films. They don't make them like The (Origional) Omen any more. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing I can't believe nobody here has commented on, is how terrible the location work was! We are expected to buy Prague as London - the two cities look NOTHING alike. Since when did London have wide cobbled avenues and tram tracks? There is even one scene - as Liev Schreiber is racing to the church at the end - where you can even SEE the word "PRAHA" (Prague) clearly on a building he drives past!Maybe this shows a lack of respect for not only the audience, by assuming they'd be too ignorant to ever know the difference, but also for anyone from either city who ever bothers to watch this movie.However, considering nobody on here even remarked on this, maybe underestimating the audience was justified.Anyway, other than that I did quite enjoy the film. Although the child playing Damian had none of the strange menace of the boy in the original. The original Damian was not an actor, so looked a lot more natural - whereas this kid was obviously told to look mean (by frowning largely), which really didn't work at all. If they'd just left him to look natural, it would have been more sinister.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>England? Who are they kidding?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I am a fan of the original films. OK - so they are quite dated, especially the first one with its quite saccharine 'love' theme. So I would have agreed that these were ripe for a remake. But it failed. This film reminds me of the failings of Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula. A selection of first-rate choices alongside a selection of second or third rate choices. Firstly, the good actors: Damien: very good choice and convincing. Father Brenan: You can't go wrong with Pete P. Mia Farrow: I thought it would be hard to surpass the original, but she gave a very different, more brooding edge to it that I liked. Michael Gambon: Again, a good choice, albeit not as good as the original. But there is has to end... the other main actors were dreadful, giving hammy, made-for-TV performances. But this paled when compared to the overall, done-on-the-cheap production. I am English and let me tell you that no where in England resembles any of the scenes. This for me was the single biggest point of failure. London doesn't have a backdrop of Eastern European architecture, nor does it have main roads made of cobbles, nor does it have elaborate lamp posts like that. The US embassy is not on the river... and no amount of CGI is going to convince me otherwise, especially with those terracotta roofed houses behind. It was cheap, cheap, cheap. And they didn't even attempt to disguise some of the shots. Driving to the church in an attempt to recreate the excellent Guildford cathedral scene of the original, you could see foreign street signs and shop signs through the back window, green-crossed pharmacy signs. It was all so out of place. Sticking a couple of CGI elements of Parliment and the London Eye isn't going to fool anyone. And that for me, was what made this such an average film. A real waste of some good talent. Especially after seeing the trailer for the film, which captured something exciting in the boy Damien. I'd like to see someone forget this remake and try again... properly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another bad remake to add to the pile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason I didn't give this title a 1 star is because of Julia Styles. She's brilliant and the coming of Mia Farrow (greatly known for the 60's shocker Rosemary's Baby) may have saved this movie from the box office poison genre.I guess for people who haven't seen the original '76 version directed by Richard Donner and starring silver screen legend Gregory Peck, this isn't half as bad. But considering the dark macabre cinematography and bone chilling score from Jerry Goldsmith, this version doesn't hold a match to the original.Bad acting, they ripped certain scenes straight from camera positions to reaffirm the ghostly surreal mood of the original and succeeds very horribly. I got this movie as part of the Omen box set and was just appalled. Hoping that it would've been a sequel and they would've tied up the series, I was horrified to find it to be a "remake." This alone should send up red flags, but alas people seem to be impressed by these things and Hollywood keeps pumping them out.It just goes to show there is no originality left, and if you want a semi fresh horror story or any kind of story for that matter, you have to resort to the straight to DVD B-rated movies of our time.If you get this movie for free as a gift or in a box set like myself, give it a chance, but really don't expect much. Check out the original for a more terrifying interpretation of Damien Thorn and the havoc he wrecks on the world!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the original Omen. I rented this out because I was expecting it'll give me the creeps. Well, not really. I ended up creeping slowly to my sleep.I didn't like that this film has "bluish or grayish" color tones. They made it "too digital", I felt like I was watching Van Helsing. This could've been better if they stick to "earth" tones since the theme is very religious. What happened to the choir tune? I think this remake lost a vital sense of "gothic-ness". Lieve Schriber's performance is subtle and very politician worthy (like Gregory Peck). However, I didn't feel any chemistry between him and Julia Stiles. Julia's performance in this movie is awkward. I mean, she failed to show a sense of terror and confusion. I just didn't buy her acting at all. She should stick to the hippie or outspoken roles.Mia Farrow's performance was brilliant. Her acting has a lot of depth and she's very convincing playing the right hand of the demon child. I wish they casted another boy to play Damien. What I like about the original one, the boy looks serious and smart.This boy on the remake looks retarded instead of conniving. I had a good laugh when the photographer was developing a film in the dark room when suddenly the scene switched to the photographer, viewing what he developed in the PC. It was hilarious because my sister asked, "Are dark rooms necessary when you're using a Digital camera?"I also found it hilarious when Liev had a meeting with someone (a doctor i believe), and the stage is so "obviously" set. There are streaks of sunlight that shines on the doctor (sitting at the middle of the room). That was so staged.In the end, the original was a masterpiece. This one is a waste of time. Sorry Liev, just wasn't a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as thoughtless Hollywood remakes of classic horror films go, The Omen is a dud...and considering how many horror movies have been massacred in the past five years by a corporate empire more concerned with profit than integrity (natch), that's saying something.Unlike, say, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Halloween or Amityville Horror remake, the problem with The Omen is not that it's mindless drivel, but that it's simply a chore to sit through. (Give me a choice, and I'll take mindless drivel over boredom anytime.) The Wagnerian chants and slow-motion death scenes that gave the original such energy and intensity are here completely forsaken for tedious exposition and lackluster plot twists. How could a film as thrilling and tense as The Omen be rendered into nothing more than a two-hour barbiturate? On the "pro" side of things, a fairly good cast has been assembled, even if they don't get much to do. David Thewlis is uncannily perfect for the role originated by David Warner--if I didn't know any better, I'd almost believe they were the same person. Mia Farrow is a highlight, trading in her normally gentle persona for a flat-out insane banshee. Everybody else is adequate, except the kid who plays Damien, whose performance closer resembles a bratty kid being given a time-out than the son of the devil. The production value is quite good. At least it looks like a horror film, if it can't act like one.Here's to hoping the studios spare us a set of sleepy sequels.</fullReview>

American diplomat's family (Liev Schreiber, Julia Stiles in the roles previously starred by Gregory Peck and Lee Remick) adopts a baby ,he's named Damien and has the devil mark : 666 . One time grown-up , young boy possessed with mysterious demonic powers causing wreak havoc and bizarre killings wherever he goes . The parents hire a nanny (Mia Farrow in the role of Billie Whitelaw) schemes that delightful child anti-Christ can have him carry out all her evil plans . The little boy seems to be around when inexplicable deaths happen including rid of several interfering adults with the aim for world domination . Damien is poised for ruling devil over earth . Meanwhile the father is warned by a priest named Brennan (Pete Postlethwaite in the role of Patrick Thoughton) and a photographer (David Thewlis in the role of David Warner).After the Exorcist , Richard Donner's Omen was one of the most famous films of all time and the major possession movie of the 70s and created an authentic sensation , originating even various sequels: Damien: Omen 2 , The final conflict and Omen 4 . The inevitable comparison between Liev Schreiber and Gregory Peck reveals that Liev is just too cool for this role in spite of Peck is an immortal star . The chief excitement lies in seeing what new and amazing victim can be dreamt by the believable FX technicians . Meantime Damien seems to dispatch new bizarre killing every few minutes of the movie . Atmospheric score by Marco Beltrani,however I miss impressive score by Jerry Goldsmith , deservedly winner one Academy Award . It's all frightening amusing , if predictable but we have seen the previous classic movie but also its predictability is redeemed in part by the charismatic performance of excellent protagonists and all around . Although redundant to original film is a fitting description of the director John Moore ; however , being sometimes a shot-for-shot recreation but it doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence . The studio originally wanted the film to receive a PG-13 rating but John Moore insisted on an R-rating, suggesting people would "smell a cop-out" if a remake of original Omen was to receive a family friendly certificate .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreadful Remake of a Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a group of movie execs decide to do a remake of a classic they are looking at the bottom line. Releasing Omen on the 6th day, of the 6th month in the 6th year was just the push they needed to put on this project. What a mistake.No sensible producer would ever remake Casablanca or Gone with The Wind. Both of these classics are scene after scene perfect. Likewise, the original Omen film was so polished that it was difficult to see how they could improve things. Do you follow the book and film closely or do a different take? Unfortunately all too often with this film they choose the frame by frame imitation, and each was a pale imitation of the original.Take the dramatic scene where Damien cycles around eventually bumping his mum over the banister. In the original the sound track was genius, it built the momentum and climaxed perfectly. In this tawdry remake there was no mood build up, no tension. The score, as throughout the rest of the film, was limp.The writer tried too hard to match real modern events with the apocalyptic apocrypha, but as they were out of synch they would have been better left out. The writing would have been just as entertaining, if not more so, if events were invented to match with the book of Revelation's predications; suggestions that the sea in Revelation 8 somehow refers to politics is just plain stupid.The cast was a troop of misfits. Julia Styles was wooden and Liev Schreiber always looked out of place; whilst Lee Remick and Gregory Peck are always going to be impossible to beat, these two TV quality stars were never going to be in the same league. I felt sorry for the real actors, the three British thespians normally found in better productions; Michael Gambon, Pete Postlethwaite and David Thewlis. David Thewlis struggled throughout to make his part worthy, but was constantly fighting against the cardboard cut-out of Schreiber that was always by his side. Michael Gambon looked apologetic for taking his bit part; he looked almost embarrassed in his scenes.To conclude, a poorly executed film aimed to tie in with a single day. It would have been better to have kept this project as a TV movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GOOD remake ... but still a REMAKE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I generally don't like remakes, they seem so, I don't know... unoriginal somehow. This was no exception, except it was genuinely well done.The art direction was flawless, except wasn't it just a LITTLE odd that the Ambassador didn't live in the official residence, and what he did live in looked like a remodeled church? The psychiatrist's office was virtually identical to that in "The Sopranos." Damien riding his Razor through the halls looked an awful lot like what Kubrick did in the halls at the Overlook Hotel in The Shining... or did Kubrick rip it off from the original Omen?? Great casting of Mia Farrow! And what a great kill! (Oops, did that need a SPOILER warning? It's a REMAKE fer chrissake!) I liked Liev Scheiber: he seemed to be channeling Gregory Peck, the same tone of voice, the same phrasing.Julia Stiles wasn't bad, despite the reviews I read at the time.When Pete Postlethwaite had his terminal experience, I liked how in the original the lightening came from a clear sky. Would have been cool if the storm had stopped the moment he... well, died.David Thewlis made an excellent David Warner. Cynical but not annoyingly so! I'm not sure I liked the color palate: too blue, great for London and the icy Italian monastery, but still too blue in Jerusalem and Rome (even though it was supposed to be winter).Specific criticisms (and yes, I did take notes while watching): Why did Postlethwaite's priest have a 666 brand? Why didn't Scheiber or Thewlis wear hats in the winter scenes in Italy? People wear hats in winter, especially if it's snowing! *HERE THERE BE SPOILERS* Wouldn't an embolism show up on an autopsy? Could you beat off a determined Rottweiler attack with a tire iron?Would the top of that sign-thing be sharp enough to behead somebody? And it would have had to have been extremely well balanced to spin like that and not just crash against the wall, before falling in a heap and crushing the poor bugger.Would a new-looking Kohler kitchen faucet drip? Didn't Damien's birthmark look more like ringworm than a birthmark?? Why didn't that cardinal with the dying Pope take that chalice of wine? Now they'll have to get those sheets dry-cleaned! Why did they save Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar-winning score for the end credits?? The new score was excellent, BTW... and I'm glad Goldsmith's was reused a bit, but more would have been good! And doesn't everybody in the world know where Meggido is, by now? Especially a foreign-service diplomat, when he was training to have a Mediterranean post. (I liked that they made him bilingual, BTW: nice touch of realism.) That's about it. I enjoyed it, and if you liked the original, you won't be too disappointed with this one. The kills were all good, too,and that's important for a film like this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What Hollywood directors fail to understand every once and again, is that even for a commercial, empty movie, you need a script. Maybe even more so that for movies that can appeal to other issues, like photography or narrative compositions. The 70's movie is not so bad, meaning the script is still based on a superficial understanding of Christian superstitions. But if you inflate that same script with an amoral big budget and cut and throw out any half intelligent sentence that was there, you get this movie. Even in commercial theaters was a failure. So, for you interested on seeing Devil movies, watch the original movie. It is better by a wide shoot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By Remake Standards, Better Than Average</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happens when the son of the devil is raised by an American politician and his young wife? Exactly what you'd expect: all hell breaks loose! While I haven't seen the original Omen in a while, I remember a few key scenes clearly and I remember I liked it. This alone is enough to make me wonder why they remade it (why remake good movies when there are so many bad films to fix?). But they did good, keeping many scenes identical but making the story very 2006 appropriate.My favorite thing about the film was the adaptation of the plot to fit around 9/11, and the space shuttle disaster, which were obviously missing from the original. This does seem to imply that American tragedies are more important than non-American ones, though. Many people really feel the apocalypse is coming, so this was an appropriate choice. I also like the move from English characters to Americans (though this really doesn't matter).The demons were spooky and the new Damien is one goony looking little boy, which is great. I don't mind a Damien that looks like Batboy from the Weekly World News. The other actors were also decent: Mia Farrow, best known to horror fans from that other Satanic child film, "Rosemary's Baby", was the perfect nanny and Liev Schreiber has that level of fame that makes him great for starring roles of this sort (not too big to overshadow the film, but big enough to fill the shoes). See "Phantoms" if you don't believe me. The actors did many of their owns stunts, with Liev Schreiber even cracking a rib.My biggest concern was Julia Stiles. I said to myself, "Self, this chick is known for over-acting in Shakespearean romances and teen comedies... can she tone it down enough for a horror film?" A few moments had Stiles poking her melodramatic head up out of the ground, but overall she played it straight and I think she was commendable.The kid who played Damien in the original returns here as a reporter, but don't throw out your copy of the original Omen. But don't go out of your way to avoid this one, either. It is a solid horror film with more than competent directing and acting behind it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Omen 666: 4 out of 10: As Hollywood remake trivia goes the answer to the best remake ever is easy, "The Maltese Falcon" which was actually the third shot Hollywood took at the same story. The worst remake ever on the other hand has some very serious competition (Gus Van Sant's completely ridiculous remake of Psycho however is an easy top five choice).Most remakes of older films attempt to update then in both content (R rating, color film, modern actors) and make them more relevant to today's audiences. The original Omen however was in color and R rated and still holds up well today. So why exactly would one remake it.Oh June sixth, 2006 (06/06/06) is coming up on the calendar and we need to cash in.A practical shot for shot remake the original Omen 666 is remarkable unnecessary. As for the invariable changes there are some positive ones both David Thewlis as the photographer and Mia Farrow as the nanny are distinct improvements over the original cast and there is a really well done decapitation scene (plus modern audiences can be reminded that is was the Omen series Final Destination cribbed its death scenes from).The negatives are overwhelming. Liev Schreiber is actually very good in the Gregory Peck role which is a shame because he is simply too young to be believable. (And the effective subtext of an older couple finally blessed with child is thrown out the window.). Lee Remick's substitute (Julia Stiles) is both miscast and simply awful in the role. She is more an emotionally abusive mother than anything else. Her acting chops are simply not up for the role.Speaking of bad acting where the producers got this Damien is beyond me but Semus Davey-Fitzpatrick is horrible as the Devil child. Little boys are naturally evil creatures and every mother must suspect at one point she has spawned the Anti-Christ. This everyman appeal of the Omen story is sucked away with Semus' ineffective performance.Outside of some exploitative tie ins to 9/11 and Katrina and a generally lesser cast this is the same Omen as before. Just not as good</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice remake in the end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I should begin by saying that I don't consider the original a masterpiece. Surely it was classic but I never came to like it too much. So I wasn't that thrilled to see this remake. But in the end I gotta say, it came off pretty good and I'm now thinking to see the original again.What really works for this film is its controlled desire of experiment and changing too much. The story is pretty much the same... only the context is updated according to present world affairs, the death scenes are more shocking and dramatic (the photographer's one is a classic!) and the acting is actually better. There's fine limited use of special visual and sound effects which adds to its scary atmosphere.Julia Stiles is always a pleasure to watch. I wish her character had something more to do. Rod Shreiber does well imitating Gregory Peck to some extent. Mia Farrow is really a surprise attraction in this film. Her portrayal of Damien's nanny is quite a treat. And finally Seamus Fitzpatrick as the anti-Christ does a very subtle but effective job of being silently spooky...Like everyone else, I too wish Hollywood pay more attention to original material. But sometimes a remake like this or two might not be that bad for a change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculing a horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man oh man! when I first heard that the omen was to be remade the only thought that occurred to me was that of "why?" Well the director said that he wanted to "place the movie in a post 9/11 world". Okay so far, the film's introduction is quite well thought of. Sadly when it finishes we are forced to watch a terribly acted repetition of the original which gives us nothing more than better designed death scenes. Liev Schreider replaces Gregory Peck (don't know if I should laugh or cry) and gives an unconvincing and in many ways indifferent performance, (see mini monologue after he's told his wife's dead), the same goes for Julia Stiles but the point where I could not do anything but laugh was when Bugenhagen showed up. He is portrayed as an old fool with sticking up hair and odd body movements. Which logical person would trust someone like him? The rest of the cast are equally bad and not even half as scary as their predecessors, the director desired to have fun with the film, well in my vocab fun is not synonymous with ridicule.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unscary remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>America loves remakes. As long as they make money drawing in the young and ignorant who missed the originals they will continue to be made. Someone got the brilliant idea that 6/6/06 was coming up and wanted to capitalize on it. This remake is rather average and as a horror movie, quite unscary. First of all I'm going to give credit to the original music, where Jerry Goldsmith truly frightened us with the score. The remake music does not even come close to giving anyone the shivers. My scariest moment in the original was when Mrs. Baylock suddenly appeared in the hospital while Mrs. Thorn was trying to change clothes. They ruined the moment in the remake by having Mia Farrow's character try to get by the nurse and bringing Damien with her. That just about killed the chill there, and having Baylock cut an air bubble in the RV to murder her was a bit gruesome. The overall acting was decent, but the actor who played Mr. Thorn was hit and miss, and the actress playing Mrs. Thorn was a bit emotionless. The priest was pretty spot on to the original. Damien was somewhat scary, but somehow he reminded me of one of the kids from the Willie Wonka remake who escaped the factory. The CG was not needed and the pole falling from the church looked very fake. Can movie makers even try to make CG look real anymore? What is happening is that too many new movies rely too much on CG where it is not needed, or they overcompensate by making the action look obviously unreal. Adding in newer devices like computers also did not impress me, pretty soon everyone in movies will raise their cell phones and take photos of everything. Yawn. I wasn't scared at any time during this remake, but I can pop the original DVD in my player and still get chills over the Baylock hospital scene and the original music whenever I hear it. Remake gets a 4 of 10. Kids, you missed out the first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very bad remake indeed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge horror fan, and having seen all (I think) of the omen films- and having been caught up in the '6/6/06' hype- I was expecting a great remake... I thought better special effects, creepier kid/music, what I got was not even close. This starts with such sloppiness- that My brother commented 'up till now- mum would have loved this' (my mum found ghost busters too scary), the kid was not menacing at all, the lack of the opera style music that used to kick in when Damien was giving his 'look' to some unsuspecting person, made it empty &amp; lacking atmosphere. The fact the kid only speaks a few times, and doesn't seem evil at all- is shocking. The mother was played by a way too young, very dippy blonde- whom didn't fit the part at all, the dad was played by a guy from many horror films- always with small parts- which I understand now! The priest's face was the scariest thing about the film! The actual gore/horror factor was so brief- I really did look down and missed one bit. Stick to the original (somthing I rarely say with remakes).</fullReview>

The death sequences are the same, the story is the same, in fact every little detail is replicated.Well done. I think that the creators of the first Omen could sue. It's that ridiculous. I believe that Hollywood wanted to cash in the whole 6.6.06 idea and that was the best thing they could come up with. It proves for one more time that there is no integrity, no artistic value and no respect for anything in the movie business.I felt embarrassed watching the new Omen.

There were two slightly redeeming qualities found in the unnecessary but entertaining death sequences and the slightly horrific but unoriginal dream sequences. There are no words to describe the mind numbing boringness of this experience. And I apologize for being trite, but there is nothing original to say about this totally unoriginal movie. And even though no one expects originality from a remake one might expect some entertainment from a series of classically entertaining movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I saw this movie last night, and I really liked it, first of all the Mia Farrow performance as the nanny from hell was spectacular (plese don't be upset, but it reminded me Louise Fletcher from "One flew over the cuckoo's nest"), she dark, evil but also tender and protective. The scene where Damian kills his mother and his smile at the end of the movie, didn't took my breath, but the dream sequences were pretty scary, the deaths cold, you literally freeze when the nanny kills Damon's mother. I also liked that the movie is full of intentionality, the bathroom scene with Julia, we see a cross backwards, and six windows, three on the right, three on the left...anyway it was a good summer movie, it has some weak points, for example for being a remake the storyline should have been more original, at the end a grown up Damien knowing that the new Savior is coming to end with his reign or something like that, also the music not so good as the first one, but don't trash it, it was good...not great just good</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was this trip really necessary?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a horror movie fan. I'll even confess to liking a remake occasionally. And I LOVE Liev Schreiber. You'd think these three factors combined would lead me to enjoy the latest in an unfortunately long (and growing) line of horror remakes, but 'The Omen' really didn't work. The original really is a classic among horror films. It was one of the few horror flicks to successfully marry higher end Hitchcock-type suspense to lower end gruesome gore-flick effects. It's stood up well over time and is not fixed so firmly in its own era to be unwatchable today. So, why does it need to be remade? I have no idea. I asked the same question of 'Psycho,' and at least Van Sant had an answer: there are people (and I've known some) who will avoid a movie simply because it's in black and white! And they're missing out, of course, on some classic cinema. Now, should we cater to these Neanderthals? I don't think so, but what do I know. Anyway, what's the answer for 'The Omen'? Gregory Peck was too old? There aren't any safari parks in England any more? Got me. Schreiber was, I first thought, an odd choice for Ambassador Thorn. Then I remembered that voice. Ah, I thought, he's got the Peck timbre! To his credit, he did quite well with a flawed and largely unnecessary script, against all odds with his flawed and largely unnecessary costar Julia Stiles (please, can't we just keep her in the teen flicks? maybe she can be an older sister or a mom or something...). While he and Postlethwaite, Thewlit and Gambon were acting there hearts out (Thewlit seemed to have built his performance heavily on Warner's original), Stiles read lines like she'd only seen the script for the first time that morning! She is usually wooden and hard to accept as real, and a high-profile film like this only throws that into stark contrast. Some reviews I've read have applauded this remake for reigning in the modern penchants in horror movies for over-the-top effects and gore. I feel like I saw a different cut of the movie, because the death effects were certainly more graphic than in the original, and went to unnecessary lengths to cinematize some deaths. Did we really need the spike's POV when Postlethwaite finally gets it? And the shards of stained glass piercing his face and body? What the hell was that window doing up there anyway?! Honestly, I had no intention of seeing this in the theatre. I was intrigued by it being remade, as it ranks among my favourite horror flicks, but knew I could wait for video. I only went to see it because my wife got all excited about it. I'm pleased to say she was as disappointed as I was. This film really did not need to happen, and should certainly not be getting the praise it's received. I'm begging the 'creators' in Hollywood: STOP with the remakes! Has a single one of these been even AS GOOD as the original? Have any of them even paid for themselves? End the madness now, and try to make something original again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comparison of the remake with the original (or: nothing but spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people condemn remakes with such a fanatic vehemence that will make you flinch. If that's a critic that makes a living out of criticizing, I can understand. Others seem to just want to say things that are fashionable.A remake does not have to be a lofty quest of bringing a revolutionizing, fresh angle. With a new director, crew and cast, there will always be something new, and that's enough. Jack Lemmon's Juror #8 may never measure up to Henry Fonda's original but that doesn't make the remake of "12 angry men" a waste of time. Almost exactly the same thing can be said about Jason Robards and Spencer Tracy for "Inherit the wind". Even the most recent "Poseidon", though markedly inferior (particularly in the characterization department), has something new to offer. The following comparison is for those who have watched both, and therefore full of spoilers. Essentially, the remake stays VERY CLOSE to the original, albeit not to the extent of the shot-by-shot remake of "Psycho". In the "Omen" remake, the filmmaker, while keeping most of the scenes, sequences and dialogue the same, has made quite a noticeable effort of doing them just a little differently. Almost too noticeable, as if to say "Hey, look, this is DIFFERENT from the original".First thing to notice is the updating of the dialogue. In the remake, in discussing their new residence in London, Katherine responds to Robert's remark that it's big by a question "You mean "bad" big?". "No, just "big" big", her husband explains. This is the sort of dialogue you wouldn't find in the original 30 years ago. (Incidentally, the use of things like "Two years later" on the screen in the remake is a mindless insult to the audiences' intelligence, a big step backwards).There are numerous examples of these little variations. The first time Damien is "lost" is experienced by both parents in the original, but by Katherine alone in the remake. Robert's accidental "run-in" first encounter with reporter Keith is physically mild in the original, just knocking his camera to the ground, while in the remake he has the poor guy almost flying away and landing flat on the ground. And while we are on that scene, Robert in the original at least answers one or two of the reporters' questions about the nanny's freak death. In the remake, he completely ignores them, as if they don't even exist. This is again an obvious update of the times, in how celebrity handles reporters (some of whom now have a new name ? "paparazzi") Coming to the more frightening scenes, the first real shocker of the "It's all for you, Damien" scene is almost completely unchanged, with one small exception ? in the original, the nanny jumping from the roof with a noose around her neck hits and smashed a window first. The impact of the shock is little changed, to someone who sees this for the first time, without any forewarning. The rottweilers that seem to have jumped right out of Baskerville are the same in both versions, that is, all over the map, except for one minor difference. In that last encounter in the house,the dog in the original is easily handled and locked away by Robert while in the remake, the filmmakers tried to squeeze the last ounce of terror out of these hellish animals. Katherine's death is where the treatments are most markedly different. In the original, Robert manages to talk to her in the hospital on the phone one last time while ironically, in the remake, the mobile phone didn't help him. Wonder if that's a deliberate jab at the development in modern communication technology? The death itself is of course visually a great deal more shocking in the original ? crash-land on an ambulance, thrown from a hospital window at a great height.What the remake has done better is in both of the visually most devastating scene ? the impalement and the decapitation. In the former, in both cases, the priest dies standing up, with the stave going right through his chest, nailing into the ground below. But the postures are markedly different. In the original, he slumps forward; in the remake, he bends backward. The latter accentuates the horror of the moment ? even when we see the image only at a distance we are compelled to visualize the blank eyes starring helplessly in the bleak vastness above. The decapitation scene in the original, focusing on the severed head of the reporter, seems powerful until you see the graphic remake that sends a shudder right down your spine with the convulsing movement of the headless body taking a few steps backwards, hands waving in the air in random desperation, before tumbling head first (or where the head had been, to be exact), down the stony steps.While staying closely to the original, the remake does introduce two things new, both failures, in my view. The first is Katherine's "dream sequence", which does absolutely nothing but add a few more scares by loud noise, the cheapest and laziest thing a filmmaker can do. The second it something that start with a bang but ends in a whimper. If the religious authorities make such a big fuss about all these recent natural and man-made disasters and phenomenon, where are they in this big quest to stop the Antichrist. Anyone who has seen "The Da Vinci Code" knows that this completely defies logic and common sense.I don't have much left in the 1,000 word limit for characters. Suffices to say, however, that this is not a movie that requires acting with any depth. Competent portrayal of certain somewhat basic emotions will be adequate. Both casts do a completely satisfactory job. I must say though that the original Damien comes across just a little creepier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well all I know is that after this seeing this film it is very clear that Hollywood has lost all sense of creativity and I am getting very annoyed by the fact the American film makers seem to think "oh lets pull out an old screenplay add some new actors and special effects and call it a new movie." The Omen (2006) is a complete waste of time and money. This film is exactly the same plot-wise as its predecessor but much less in fact way less frightening.For those fans of the original, gone is the famous musical score, way better Mrs. Baylock, and amazing performance by Gregory Peck, and we are left with an utterly dull rehash that is completely predictable.For those Omen "virgins" who are mildly intrigued by the previews, don't see this version please don't. Seeing this version will ruin the effect the omen truly does or did have on audiences. Because the original was terrifying and had a great epic feel. So if you want to experience the true experience of The Omen, I suggest do not do what i did and pay ten bucks to see a movie that was already made and just wait for Halloween when they play The Omen (1976) on cable T.V. that way you don't have pay anything and you will get frightened and you will not feel scammed.Face it horror remakes are very ridiculous and are never worth viewing so don't see this one at all. And what really made me angry when i went and watched this film is I saw previews for like five more horror remakes, including The Wicker Man, oh my god nooo why are they doing this. Hasn't Hollywood learned yet with such flops as The Fog and this one The Omen. Where is the creativity? Where is the true, new horror film?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Omen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake of The Omen will mark a triple grand slam of horror movies I watched in a row (which is so rare), with Slither and Silent Hill making up the other two. From one demonic kid in the latter movie, to Damien, one of the earlier demonic kids in cinematic history, this remake, like most remakes, will make you wonder, just what is the point?Director John Moore (watched his remake of Flight of the Phoenix, and Behind Enemy Lines) has crafted it scene for scene, but of course with the usual updates made in setting and the props department. The story plays on this year's calendar with 6th June 2006 (6.6.06) being extremely attractive for such a film to open, with the triple 6s the number of the devilish beast. And I guess most Singaporeans will still fall for any horror movie hook line and sinker, as many evening screenings on that day, were completely sold out. Mental note to self - horror films should make money here.As the hokey prophecy goes (hokey because the film forces relatively current events to fit the trumpeting angels of Revelations), the son of Satan will make his appearance of Earth, and spell the end of mankind. Sounds boring, doesn't it, especially since John Constantine already had a field day bitch-slapping Son of Satan back to hell, and showing the devil the middle finger while at it too.Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles star as the Thorns, parents to Damien, son of Satan, born from a jackal. An ambassador, Robert (Schreiber) makes an illegal pack with a priest (never trust false prophets I tell you), and innocently raises Damien as his own. As our boy grows up, strange happenings start to occur, starting with the happy self-hanging of their nanny. Pete Postlethwaite stars as Father Brennan, who takes it upon himself to warn Robert of dire consequences, and the need to rid Damien soonest possible. But things aren't easy, especially with a new nanny Mrs Baylock (Mia Farrow, in quite chilling a role), being the new surrogate guardian of her hellish master.Just how terrifying is this remake of The Omen? By today's standards, and given the remake, it is a piece of chicken feed. It's not scary, and the death scenes are so Final Destination-ishly bad, they make the deaths in Final Destination look like instant classics. The body count is not high as well (maybe Damien needs to grow his powers first), and we're only offered 3 "grandeur" deaths in the whole movie. And it's always sad for a horror movie to have to rely on cheap scares to try and frighten the audience. And what more, in dream sequences too, with quick cuts, and loud crescendos. Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick probably is the child actor with the easiest role to date, and all it requires is of him to act like he's constipated all the time. Not very challenging to stretch his acting chops, but then again, the rest of the cast all had it easy too.The version shown in local theatres is the edited version, with some noticeable "censored" bits glaringly missing. So if you prefer your gore in its complete glory, then you might reconsider. Then again, you might be better off with the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another remake, and a sad one at that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen 2006 is not a good movie at all. There is no real suspense, only a few shocks and surprises that, though good, are never quite enough to make this movie anything better than sub-par.Liev Schrieber and Julia Stiles play Robert and Katherine Thorn, the parents of Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) who is the son of the devil. There is no real spoiler though because just about everybody who remembers the original from 1976, a much better film then this one, already knows what the plot involves.And this movie follows the original almost exactly with the exception of different actors and actresses. If you've seen the first film, you'll quickly realize that this film has no surprises in store. I found this to be disappointing because I was expecting the director to add his own touches. The only thing this movie has on the first is better special effects for more creative deaths but nothing else. I actually became bored with it.The only part of the film I did like was Mia Farrow as Mrs. Baylock and the photographer. Nothing else was even remotely good. Even the dialoque was pretty bad in this movie, and the kid who played Damien wasn't even spooky or chilling like the original actor.I don't have to go into plot details because the story is almost identical to the 1976 film. If you've seen that film you already know what's going to happen.I know many people will go to see this movie anyway because of the release date 6-6-06, but my response to this is if you go to see it, go to the matinée instead. You'll feel better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cast: Bad Acting: Bad Plot: Un-developed and bad Direction: Mediocre in places, otherwise bad Score: Bad Costumes: Bad Sets: Really BadThis is a bad bad film, I hate to say it but I enjoyed recent remake fodder House of Wax and Amityville Horror better than this. the plot was very, very slow, characters had no development. For some reason Ambasador Thorne lives in a castle which appears larger than Buckingham Palace in the middle of a country estate with acres of green land, which the title card kindly informs us is 'London'. This patronizing moment sums up most of the film. When the character's die, you feel no compassion for them because they are so 2D and lifeless. In some horror films this doesn't matter because you at least get a good gore fest or a good villain, but not in this. No action, nomomentum, no decent preformaces. Rubbish.In short this is a terrible film. Hollywood, please stop wasting money on pointless remakes and plough some dough into an original idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>some bad horror movies are lame-funny; this one's just lame-lame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one should go see this movie. Not because it's evil or satanic or whatever, but because it's a waste of time and money. Actually, if causing other people to waste their time and money is evil (which it may well be) and frittering away one's God-given creativity on crap like this is evil (which it almost certainly is) then I'd have to rescind my earlier comment--perhaps this movie is evil.Allow me to elaborate...I'm still not exactly sure why I went to see The Omen (which, if you don't know, is a remake/updating of a "classic" horror movie from the 70s). Or, rather, I know why. The fact is, I was bored, I had nothing to do, I was all alone in New York City (which would seem to counteract the first two reasons, but I'm rather poor, which makes it especially possible to be both bored and to have little to do in NYC), and I'd seen little news blurbs about 6-6-6 (i.e., June 6, 2006) all day, so I guess this all tickled my sense of humor. In fact, I even went to see the 6:00 screening, which was not be trying to tempt the devil as much as when I happened to come up with the bright idea of seeing a movie. There being nothing else out that I felt even the slightest inclination to see, I went to see The Omen in the East Village.It sucked. The original movie was not particularly good--it somehow attained a cult status--not sure why. But this movie was just lame, lame, lame. I didn't expect anything else, really, but I was hoping that the flick would be lame-funny, not just lame-lame or lame-boring. Unfortunately, even my extremely low expectations were not met. The movie wasn't funny, it wasn't scary (except for 2-3 "boo" moments which were physically effective mostly because of the soundtrack, not what you were seeing on screen), it wasn't even creepy, despite being about the child of Satan. How is this even possible? Beats me.Now, the Exorcist I think is a very creepy, good horror movie. It freaks me out each time I see it. I think it's because in the Exorcist, the film focuses on the humanity of the little possessed girl before she gets possessed, so you actually care about her a bit, which makes the demon possession that much more horrifying. Damian is a cyborg from the moment we lay eyes on him--he's a creep, so of course he acts creepy--I will say that his absurd "evil" looks were a little bit funny, at least, but I felt that the audience was stretching to chuckle a bit here and there when we got a close-up of Damian's robotically non-expressive face. Plus, the parents are idiots. All of a sudden, his mother dislikes the child--this makes sense, of course, but there's little work done to show us her progression from proud mother to frightened future-victim. The father is actually mentally deficient enough to accept some unknown woman's child in the first place (which requires a massive dosage of stupid pills for viewers at the very outset of the movie), and then ethically deficient enough to keep his ludicrous decision from his darling wife, even after she begins to get the willies around Damien. Anyway, you know all this--I'm just saying that if the movie is neither funny nor scary, that's about all there is because there's certainly no great plot, and the characters are impossible to care about or like. Plus, Liev Schreiber has several chins and no discernible jaw bone, despite the fact that he's not fat. What's up with that?Don't see it. It sucks. Don't pay to see it in a theater, don't rent it, don't even accept an offer from a friend willing to pay for your ticket. The best we can hope for is that it won't make it through this coming weekend, which is one expectation which the movie might actually live up to.It sucked--did I mention that?Oh, one interesting moment. Early in the movie--first 5 minutes or so, Vatican astronomers/astrologers interpret various prophecies of the apocalypse, and they posit that the 9/11/01 terrorist attacks were one fulfillment of prophesy. There was an image of the towers burning, and I'm pretty sure people in the audience gasped. I wonder if that only happened in NYC, or if that will happen all over the country.Last, the East Village theater where I saw the film was very cool. It still had some of that old movie-palace art deco decor, and I miss that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie without soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the exception of the Scream movies, I don't believe I have ever seen anything with Liev Schreiber and I can safely say I don't plan on seeing any other offerings he might have.I'll take the chance of having the humorless Sean Penn show up at my door by saying I can't see why anyone would put this wooden clone of a man in a film. Much like Damien, he is without soul and I don't believe I have seen a more passionless couple in my life as Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles.Even if Damien wasn't the spawn of Satan, he wouldn't stand a chance with this pair raising him.Much like Liev Schreiber, this movie has no soul. Sure it has a certain flow from a beginning to the end, but lacks any sort of feeling. The movie just seemed to jump from point A to B.Example: We see Damien's birthday party, if one didn't already know that the women who hung herself was his nanny, you probably wouldn't have figured it out until they were looking for a replacement. While the original built suspense with acting, this tried to generate a few quick jumps and not much else.This isn't entirely without merit as the beheading scene, while different from the original was quite well done. The scene when Julia Stiles fell from the upper floor though would have been better if it had not been "stylized'.I know some young people who were eagerly awaiting this and I suspect they will be let down.Gotta go, I hear someone at the door. It's probably Sean Penn, and that's a lot scarier than "The Omen"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When The Omen first came out I was thinking the same thing as everyone else "Oh, this is just gonna be some cheesy remake that was rushed just so they could have a cool 06-06-06 (June 6, 2006)" so I went to the opening show and said what the heck lets see what they did. To my surprise, the movie was pretty good. There was a lot of suspense and jumps that just wasn't there in the original. The Omen's story changed very little from the original but the new version was better acted, showed more to the characters and got more involved with the story, and was actually kind of scary. I'd really recommend this movie to those who are looking to see a well done horror movie with out all the over dose of blood and gore, there's very little of it in relation to other movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Nightmare on Elm Street, and it focuses on the story more than the special effects. This movie will entertain you and maybe even scare you a little bit so go see it and have some fun.</fullReview>

The exact shots with the exact camera locations, exact angles, exact events with the exact parts that first time viewers will scream most of the movie, very small differences. I was like watching the movie again, so i was sitting very calm while people was screaming, i felt a bit bored... Overall, it's better than the old one coz after all we have now more technology to do such movies, but having watched the old one, made me not much impressed by the second, as it didn't have anything new to offer. Actually i think the only reason they did a remake was the date, nothing more. Overall, i think it's a must see if you are a fan of all this kinds of movies (omen, 9th gate...etc.) and try to watch it June 06</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Terrible Remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "The Omen" was released in 1976. It was a kind of follow up to the successful "Rosemary's Baby" of 1968. In "Rosemary's Baby," the heroine (a frail and boyish Mia Farrow) conceives a baby through Satan and gives it birth. When the movie ends, she's rocking the neonate and cooing to it.In the original "The Omen," the demonic baby is a changeling who was switched at birth with the offspring of a jackal and Satan. In a sense, the original should have been called "Rosemary's Baby Grows Up," at least to the age of two, at which point he and his evil associates manage to knock off both parents and clear the way for Damien to the White House.It happened apace in the two sequels, or was it three -- or four? I forget. I didn't watch any past "Damien 2" or whatever it was called, so I don't know his fate.It doesn't matter. Apparently the pattern had exhausted its potential and died out. Now that another generation has appeared, it seems time for a re-run of "The Omen", this time with Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles as the parents. Mia Farrow and a dog are available to help the evil designs be realized. They are.I can't recommend this. It's bloodier, more lurid, and edited at a faster pace than the original -- but it's still a remake of a ripoff. And none of these "Omen" movies are as well done as "Rosemary's Baby," which started this whole cascade of junk.These remakes and ripoffs are getting pretty tiresome overall. Most are bigger and splashier than the originals but that's not enough to recommend them. It looks like originality has gone down on whatever scale is used to measure it, while pandering to an audience of kids looking for adrenalin rushes has gone up.Pfui.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it tried to be faithful to the story of the original (which not necessarily a good thing), the remake sorely missed the Gothic score of the original. The original had very creepy moments, even in repeat viewing, could not be achieved in the remake. The casting was much weaker. The 2 leads I thought was miscast. Liev Schreiber was no Gregory Peck. I like Julia Stiles, but she was not credible in her role. Not that the original was a top-notch movie, but the remake made that seemed so. That said, those who never saw the original will enjoy it as a mediocre thriller. Unfortunately, they will miss out the spooky atmosphere of the original, a thriller and a horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>never as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter how much Hollywood tries to remake the classics (i.e. "Psycho"), they're never as good as the original. The '76 version is truly scary. Well cast, solid script and the final scene still spooks me. This one doesn't cut it. Julia Stiles is too young for the role. I still see her as the high schooler in "Ten Things I Hate About You". There's no chemistry between her and Schreiber (although he does a good job). The fear factor just isn't there and I don't know why directors can't get medical stuff right. There's no way the IV pump would allow an air bubble in the line. The littlest bubble would set alarms off. Plus, it would take a lot more air than that to be lethal. Also, after she flatlines, she's still struggling? whatever. And no one ever seems to work in these hospitals. No one would've noticed? How about a nice KCl push--that'll do the trick lickety split. It also cracks me up that people are saying there are spoilers. Spoilers? Remember guys, this is a remake, we know how it ends. Stick with the original. I just hope Hollywood doesn't try a remake of "Rosemary's Baby".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lest anyone think I am bashing this remake for the hell of it, allow me to be very clear on something. I find the whole concept of a Satanic conspiracy running the world and murdering children unchecked utterly ludicrous. Especially given that of all the world's people, I am among those most likely to join such an organisation if it offers opposition to certain normalistic status quos, just out of spite. So when I say that everything the 1976 production of The Omen gets right, the 2006 version gets wrong, you have to understand where I am coming from. Like many films of the late 1970s, the real Omen was done on a tight budget, with not a lot of provision made for accomplishing elaborate illusions. Storytelling skills, acting, and clever timing was required to bring the viewer into the story. And in spite of viewing the source material as a load of drug-addled arrant nonsense, the 1976 film drew me in, thanks in no small part to a performance by Gregory Peck that caused me to sympathise with him.Now, I am not going to say that Liev Schreiber fails here. Of all the performances in The Omen circa 2006, his is easily the best. Its just that the screenwriter, editor, and director give him so very little to work with here. Giovanni Lombardo Radice makes a long overdue debut in "legitimate" film here (astute observers will recognise his name from Italian exploitation trash like Cannibal Ferox). He may as well have not bothered, considering how well this remake was sold on the world circuit. Which further cements my point. The reason the 1976 film drew me in despite its problems was because it slowly built up the tension, keeping the viewer in as much doubt as possible about the truth of the scenario, right to the end. Everything in the 2006 remake is on fast-forward, with no passion for the material on display at any moment. Clumsy reedits do not help either. At one scene, Robert Thorn determines right there and then to kill Damien. One scene later, when he is being told how to do it, he is telling us the idea is madness. I do not know whether David Seltzer or John Moore are responsible for this, but they needed to know they cannot have it both ways.A good example of this terrible writing and planning is demonstrated by the first big death scene. Robert's superior in the American embassy is killed in a manner that can only be described as utterly ludicrous. If you have seen the film already, you know what I am about to say. If you haven't yet, I am doing you a favour by warning you. Put simply, if I locked a man in his car, put a lit cigarette down some fifty feet from the car, and poured petrol over the car in the hope it would run to the cigarette then ignite, he would have an abundance of time to escape before the petrol ignited. And that is making the bold assumption that the petrol would ignite at all. Having set no small number of things on fire when I was younger, I learned a lot about how difficult it can be to set fuels alight with different triggers. Petrol is not easy to ignite when it is soaking into concrete or bitumen to start with, and the odds against a lit cigarette dropping an ember into the liquid, as would be necessary to start the fire, are not astronomical but they are still quite high.That is about the level of respect the entire film treats the audience and the cast with, however, so get used to it. Seriously, if they wanted to make a memorable version, they should have let me write the script. No supernatural tricks, no global conspiracy that cannot even sign its own name without raising suspicions. For starters, I would probably write that the child we see throughout the film is in fact not the Antichrist, and this is all an elaborate ruse to get the real Antichrist, already an adult and looking for a way into the political system, into Thorn's position. Hell, just for a giggle, I would make this Antichrist someone whom Thorn already knows. No need to set up a silly adoption routine that way, and it shows more imagination in a few sentences than anyone demonstrated in this entire film. If anyone in Hollywood is reading this, take it as a sign of how far you are falling behind the expectations of your customer base.Another aspect the new Omen does not seem to get is that character development triumphs over all else. Like I said, the 1976 original is a silly story based on an even sillier idea, but it works because the director makes the effort to sell you that story. In the original, we slowly came to believe Harvey Stephens as the ultimate expression of evil because of the actions of those protecting him, along with subtle cues that reinforce his evil quality in spite of his consumingly cute appearance. Put simply, Richard Donner knew well that there was more to selling a character as evil than appearances, a fact demonstrated by the final shot of Damien in the 1976 film. By comparison, the final shot of this 2006 remake demonstrates that John Moore thinks looking evil is enough to make a character evil. Sorry John, but speaking as someone who has seen no end of abuse because of this kind of thinking, I would like you to take the attitude and go back to the nineteenth century where it belongs.For these reasons, I gave The Omen circa 2006 a three out of ten. Normally, I would give it a two, thus ruling it out of so-bad-its-good territory, but Schreiber earns it an extra star. He is about the only aspect of the film that was not phoned-in.</fullReview>

Marco Beltrami wrote an awful score. When the scene got a little intense there was no music, I just don't get it. Liev Schiber was so bland and didn't show any emotion whatsoever in this movie, bad actor. Mia Farrow was bad as well and so were the other casts. I wouldn't even recommend renting this movie. Stay far away. I would suggest sticking with the original Omen. Why does Hollywood insist on making re-makes when there is nothing wrong with the original.

		<shortDescription>the omen thirty years later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The block Hollywood has been going through for several years must be big enough to prompt producers to produce remakes of successful films and "the Omen" is one of them. This remake opened on the 06th June 2006, a beautiful date to serve the publicity campaign to promote the film. By the way, what's its contents worth? I'll be frank and say that it's a well-crafted but lackluster menu for it contents itself to take literally virtually all the sequences of Richard Donner's opus and to reproduce without trying to bring something new or novel the different steps of the story. However, there's one major difference with its elder brother and it is to be found at the very beginning. The scenes in Rome at the Vatican weren't included in the 1976 movie. Otherwise it's the same draft-proof universe with, however some little modifications. In Donner's film, in one sequence Damien's mother was irritated by the noises her son made with billiards balls. In Moore's effort because of the modernity of the habits video games superseded these balls. That said, Moore succeeds better than Donner to build a latent and lasting tension to the audience and to ensure her a good dose of shivers and it often works. The best sequence would probably be the death of Damien's mother in alternate editing with Damien staring at a cop who's sweating.But the cast is patchy. Liev Schreiber was a better choice than Gregory Peck as the lead because he's younger. But Julia Stiles can't match Lee Remick. Ditto for David Thewlis who isn't as good as David Warner. As for Pete Postlethwaite, he was far better and disquieting in Bryan Singer's brilliant "the Usual Suspects" (1995). But Mia Farrow as the housekeeper gets the lion's share and I can't help but smiling when I think about her real function in this remake: she has to defend Damien and so Satan whereas in "Rosemary's Baby" (1968), she struggled against him.This remake of a good fantastic film doesn't certainly deserve to be disowned and the movie buffs who gave thumbs up to Donner's flick might be curious to have a look at it even if they know where they stand with it. Anyway, this remake of a fantastic film dealing with Satan is preferable to another lousy fantastic film on the same topic. See "End of Days" (1999) or "Lost Souls" (2000).By the way, the little Harvey Stephens who held Damien's role in 1976 has a cameo as a journalist here.</fullReview>

It started off quite promising with lots of recent events eg. tsunami being given as evidence of the the scriptures being fulfilled, but for me the sense of drama didn't continue. Where the original film built up the suspense and used the splendid Ave Satan to crank up the atmosphere I felt this film just wanted to make you jump with the absurdly loud noises throughout. For me the casting was a bit hit and miss, I thought Liev Schreiber was adequate as Robert Thorn but thought Julia Stiles a little young for the role of Kathy. For me the worst cast role was definitely Mia Farrow as Mrs Baylock, she came off like a ditzy old lady and not nearly as menacing as Billie Whitelaw in the original film.To sum up, the 1976 version is the only film I have ever watched that has scared me, even now I only watch it during the daytime. However for this film I felt one of the most powerful moments was when the familiar sound of Ave Satan was played over the closing credits!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Only I Could Give A Negative 10 Rating...This Was TERRIBLE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm still trying to figure out why there was so much hype built up for such a terrible movie. I saw it last night expecting to see a very scary movie, but there was only one jumpy part which wasn't even frightening since they'd showed it in the trailer. I was more scared of the trailer than I was of the actual movie. From beginning to end The Omen was very lame, pathetic, cheesy, and just down right awful. I feel as though I'm being very negative with this so I have been trying to find something good to say about it; I haven't come up with anything. This movie was a complete waste of money, it delivered far more laughs than it did scares. If I had have wanted to laugh I would have gone to The Break Up cause I hear that's great. So if you're looking for a scare, do not waste your time with this movie. The frustration and disappointment I felt when I left the theatre led me to conclude that The Omen is the WORST MOVIE EVER!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate remakes -- but in my opinion, this one actually lived up to the mark. I had read the reviews and didn't have very high expectations at all, but when I walked out of the movie I realized that for once, the remake was almost as good as the original. Liev Schreiber, Julia Stiles, Mia Farrow, David Thewlis -- all did a nice job -- exactly what I would expect of actors of their caliber.There were some things I found lacking, such as the musical score was not quite what I had wanted ( then again, how do you improve what the original had without ripping it off?), and the pacing of the movie at times was a little rushed, especially the last third or so.I think lately the critics are just out of touch, they seem to condemn movies while audiences disagree. My two cents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unfortunate effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My 14 yr old and I have been looking forward to seeing this, I told him about the original and we were hoping for a good scare. Unfortunately, the only scare we had was from the lack of air conditioning in the theater (interesting effect to watch a movie about the coming of Hell to earth while SITTING in Hell!)SPOILERS!!!!!The director resorted to the freshman use of blaring sound and fast movement to "scare" the audience. Frankly, it was embarrassing. Combine that with the over abundant use of the color red to denote potentially scary or graphic scenes and it just became a labor to watch(maybe they bought the spare props from The Village). I apologize to those who worked on this movie, I am sure you all did your best... sometimes it just doesn't work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood ruins another horror classic. Don't get me wrong, The Omen did have it's high points (i.e. the deaths), but overall, the acting was flawed, characters didn't seem to fit well and many portions of the movie were dull. Julia Styles gives a lackluster performance and even some of her lines are laughable, simply because she is so over dramatic. However, the horror genre may have found a new reigning spook child, as the pale-faced "Damien" played the part extremely well.Like many other Hollywood horror flicks, the film relies chiefly on quick jumps to keep you interested and keep you telling yourself, "maybe this is scary, after all." In the end, it's not. Nothing compared the original, especially the difference in casts. Definitely a movie you'd be better off renting, because most of the main points and scares are in the previews. But, the timely death sequences are unique in their own way and very stylish. (poor Pete Postlewaithe) Once again, see the original. The Omen does have it's very few strengths, but flaws overrun this poorly acted horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Creepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen is a very creepy movie and I did not understand such a low rating here on IMDb. But then I didn't know other Omen movies even existed, so the users here have obviously compared this to the original and have found this version to be far inferior. I have not seen any of the previous 'The Omen' movies and I have seen this movie many times. This is actually one of my favourite horror movies and I was surprised and sad when I heard that this movie is a carbon copy of a 1970's movie. I thought it was an original movie and I had so much respect for the director John Moore. Now even though I know it is a remake, I still love this movie and will give the original movies a try. I like Liev Schreiber from his X-Men movies and here he gives an alright performance.An American official, Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber) is informed that his newborn child had died, but the mother is alright, and that she cannot have any more children. Robert is heartbroken, but a priest in the hospital advises him to exchange his dead son for another newborn child whose mother is dead and father is lost. Since his wife Katherine Thorn (Julia Stiles) doesn't know that their own son is dead, he agrees to it and takes the other child, Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) home. After a couple of years, Robert is made the youngest Ambassador of US and life seems to be going smoothly, except a couple of disagreements with his wife. On the day of Damien's birthday, the nanny hangs herself from the top of the house, which is really disturbing. A priest comes to Robert to tell him that the bad things are just beginning and his son Damien is the devil incarnate and was born to a jackal. He scoffs at him and goes about his work. After a couple more incidents and his wife confessing to a psychiatrist that she is afraid of Damien, Robert decides to track down Damien's past along with a photographer.The atmosphere of the movie is very eerie and disturbing, the background score also adds to the creepiness. Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick was really amazing as the devil boy, he looked really creepy and though he only had a couple of dialogues, he did a wonderful job. I thought Julia Stiles wouldn't give the character enough justice, as she was still young from her teen movie roles, but even she was perfect. The nanny from hell was awesome and scary, I was very scared the first time I saw her. I generally dislike dogs and the dog was also scary. The climax gives an incredible adrenaline rush and I was praying that Robert would kill Damien, but the director made him a grandson of the US President (Robert was his Godson) and Damien is closer than ever in his masterplan to destroy the world. I would recommend this movie to everyone who hasn't seen the original, as many say the original is a lot better than this and this would be entertaining only to those who haven't seen the original.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie and I'm still a bit on edge! That kid is SCARY! I've heard a lot of negative things about this movie and that's disappointing, because the movie was so good. I don't know that I have ever seen the original so that probably helps my opinion of this particular film. What I've seen for negative comments from people who didn't like the movie was that it was a poor remake. Well, I have nothing to compare it to and I loved it. Liev Schrieber is SUCH a good actor and believable in these types of roles (think "Cotton Weary" in Scream). Julia Stiles plays her supporting role well, though I think her fear of Damien could have been more pronounced - even to the point of madness/hysterics.I was thoroughly enthralled from beginning to end with this movie - it kept my attention and I was excited from scene-to-scene to see where it was going (again, I have not seen the original). Liev is wonderful and that kid is creeepy. There's enough action to keep you engaged and enough mystery to keep you wanting more. That's enough for me. If you haven't seen the original, definitely check out the 2006 Omen - it's worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched ''The Omen'''in the movie theaters, expecting it to be frighting,since the classical version had good reviews and the trailer looked so awesome. I didn't find it disturbing, only in one scene I had a little tension, but nothing so exceptional. One of the reasons why I was in the mood to watch this movie, was because I had just watched ''Rosemary's baby'' in DVD, so I found both plots similar in some stuff, like a kid that is the devil incarnate. In The Omen's case, the story is more elaborated, explaining about the devil and why it is coming to Earth. The boy, Damien, is also very, very BAD, while in the Rosemary's baby we don't see the baby becoming a kid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yay, another remake. Oh wait...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I have been waiting for the remake of The Omen since I heard about it. It was also released on 6-6-06, a brilliant move to attract the audience brave enough to weather the impending apocalypse (ha!). The previews artfully made it look like the original, but with crafty new changes. Unfortunately, the remake was odd and seemed pieced together. The character development was nil, and when the writers attempted it, it came off as shallow and silly. I did not care for the characters at all, as they weren't incredibly endearing in the first place. A few of the characters and events seemed so out of place I woke up (because at some parts it was THAT boring) wondering if the movie was over and the ushers had decided to play a bad trick on me and move me to a different theater. The special effects were interesting, but nothing was new or innovative enough to save this movie. Though the movie tried to keep me in constant suspense, I found it terribly hard to stay attentive (or even conscious). Some of the camera angles and scenery were pretty, but I think I saw the boom mic in a couple of scenes, which totally turned me off. Liev Schreiber (Robert Thorn) was okay; although all the lines he had were "Okay" "Hey", "Let's Go", or "Hey, my son is totally NOT the antichrist!" Or some variant of those. I felt that he could be a decent actor if the script called for it. The bad writing also made him look like a total wuss; and I was turned off by that immediately. Julia Stiles (Katherine Thorn) had me in tears. Mostly because I was mourning her HORRIBLE outfits (that hideous purple thing? If I were Damien, I would have attacked her too) or because I was laughing so hard at how she delivered her lines. Often, when she wanted to convey fear, it looked as if she had smelled something horrible, or had just heard Paris Hilton's new album. The people next to me in my theater also laughed quite a lot at her lines, as she delivered them as if she was in a parody. Which, unless I had fallen asleep, she wasn't in. I'm not even going to discuss David Thewlis (who played the photographer, Keith Jennings), because I felt his part was totally unneeded. His acting was fine but honestly, he didn't need to be in this movie. I did say "Yay, its Lupin" when he came on screen, however. Lastly, there was Mia Farrow (Mrs. Baylock). She was amazing in this movie. The scenes she was actually in attracted my attention, as she looked either entirely psychotic or entirely too happy, or a combination of the two. She was enchantingly evil, like Mary Poppins from Hell. I loved her. In conclusion, stay home and rent the original. This movie isn't worth the hype (But don't go see X-men 3, either.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Better then expected re-make of the 1976 horror classic "The Omen" about the return of the Devil/Antichrist on earth in the guise of young Damien Thron,Samus-Davey Fitzpatrick, the son of Robert Thorn, Liev Schreiber, not only the US ambassador to Great Britian but the Godson of the President of the United States. Right from the start Damien was a mystery to his father Robert when in the Rome maternity ward he was told by the Catholic priest Father Spiletto, Siovannie Lombardo Radice, who had delivered him that his and his wife Kate's, Julia Stiles, newborn son died in childbirth and was replaced by another newborn who's mother died giving birth to him.Growing up in London young Damien seems to be a normal child but later when he turns five a number of strange events have his father feel that besides not really being his own Damien has a weird and almost murderous influence on those around him. At Damien's fifth birthday party two things happen that should have alerted Robert to his, secretly, adopted sons weirdness. This eerie and terrifying "Devil Dog" shows up and later becomes almost inseparable from young Damien. Damien's nanny, Amy Huck, later commits suicide by jumping off a high ledge on the Thorn house with a rope tied around her neck in an insane attempt to entertain the young boy.At the Damien birthday party is free-lance photographer Keith Jenning, David Thewlis, who after developing a number of photos that he took of the nanny finds a dark line, much like a hang rope, attached to her head. It's much later when Jenning photographs Father Brenner, Pete Postlethwait, who tried to tell Robert the truth about Damien is suddenly killed when a steel pole falls from the top of his church, during a violent thunder storm, impaling and killing him. In the photos that Jennings took of Father Brenner was a strange white line, like the pole that killed him, going straight through his body. Later at Father Brenner's apartment Robert who together with Jennings was searching the place out for clues that could explain the outlandish charges against Damien. Jennings mistakenly photographed his reflection in a mirror and sees, after he developed the film, that he like the late Father Brenner was also marked for death. Robert at first was totally against what Father Brenner told him, that his son Damien is the dreaded Antichrist of the book of Revelation. After a number of events, that the late Father Branner predicted, happened to him and Kate with Kate later mysteriously dying in her hospital room convinced him that everything about Damien that Father Brenner told him is true.Together with Jennings Robert finds the grave of Damien's true mother and Damien himself as well as a trip to the Holy Land to see the Catholic Church archaeologist Bugeohagen ,Michael Gambon, which ended with Jennings tragically losing his head, like the photo of himself predicted. The truth began to dawn on Robert and that his worst fears that he kept hidden deep inside may very well be true. It was the very last doubt that Robert had about Damien's identity, being the Antichrist, the Satanicly evil birthmark 666 being somewhere on his body that finally convinced Robert with it, the mark, being discovered hidden under his hair. The 2006 horror/thriller "The Omen" follows the original almost scene by scene with a few new shocks and jolts thrown in for good measures with the only drawback , and it's a big one, being the new versions soundtrack that omits the scary and frightening Latin Satanic Chant in the 1976 movie "Hail Satan". One really big plus in the new movie "The Omen" is Mia Farrow as the new nanny, replacing the one who killed herself, and secret and fanatical Devil worshiper Mrs. Baylock. Mia Farrow/Mrs. Baylock changes right before you eyes from a sweet and caring person into a homicidal and hysterical witch. Who's battle, together with Damien's pet Devil Dog, with Robert at the end of the movie has to be one of the most hair-raising sequences ever put into a motion picture.The new version of "The Omen" is one of the better re-makes of a previous block-buster that in some scenes, like the out of nowhere dog attack on Robert and Jenning at the cemetery, actually improves on the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So..lots of people are saying that this movie suck,it isn't scary, and that people should refrain from seeing it. I definitely disagree. I have seen the original and loved it..it had that gritty old horror movie feel to it and the music made the movie. I couldn't wait to see the remake and me and my friends (they have all seen the original too) all loved it. It's a great movie. I never got bored watching it and 4 or 5 times I jumped about 5 feet off the chair. This movie is different than the original in that it is wayy jumpier. The old one was very scary in it's own way but never really made me jump. I don't see what the big problem is with the new actors..I think they all did great, especially the new Damien. But anyway...I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good scare that you and your friends can talk about the whole ride home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-directed chiller succeeds in evoking that ol' sense of Satanic evil.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sixth day of the sixth month in 2006 drew a good crowd in rainy Sydney for a rare Tuesday opening of a film - the remake of The Omen.I have only fleeting memories of the original film, and they don't strike me as hugely relevant when I consider the experience of the new one. This was a properly creepy, fun, suspenseful and doomy horror film which connected with myself and a roused audience. Perhaps the early scenes establishing the characters of US ambassadorial assistant Liev Schreiber and his wife Julia Stiles trundle out a little flatly, but by the time we are deep in dread theories about the rebirth of the anti-Christ, those scenes are long forgotten.The couple's awful little son, Damien, is weird and immediately offputting in the tradition of nearly all horror film trouble children of recent memory, but in his favour, he almost never speaks, merely favouring friend or foe with the appropriate smirk or evil eye. The strangeness of his lack of rapport (or communication, period) with his parents - or anyone else at all, really - is so incredibly obvious that it makes the film's job of revealing him as a vehicle for evil pretty easy. In spite of this, Julia Stiles gives a nicely realistic performance of a mother struggling to work out what's wrong between her and her son.The death scenes which ensue when various folk start to wise up to the child's satanic origins reminded me strongly of the Final Destination films. Those who are marked for death are marked well in advance, and the game is in the waiting and watching for the fatal set-pieces to be executed. Even though I knew the basic sequence and manner of deaths from the original film, I still found these scenes to be effectively directed and nail-biting, with gory payoffs that won't leave anyone accusing the film of being a Horror Lite.While Stiles cries and grapples with the dawning reality of what's happening with their kid, Schreiber goes around denying it, and he does end up looking a little silly for his efforts. The film's plot movements are by no means bulletproof, but by the time most of the cast have rallied to the cause, there's enough at stake, enough nasty deaths in their wake and a sufficient atmosphere of imminent doom in the air that once again, the weak spots don't matter. Emotionally and viscerally, the film rings true, successfully straddling the line between evoking scary fun and thrills and a sense of greater unstoppable evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Uninspired Antichrist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blindly following the annoying trend of remaking classic horror movies, "The Omen 666" does an GREAT job in ... adding absolutely nothing at all! In fact, this might even be the absolute most pointless and redundant remake of them all, since director John Moore somehow managed to copy the original 1976 milestone scene by scene, only without including any of the malicious atmosphere or breathtaking suspense. The story follows the exact same patterns of development as the supernatural murders committed by the evil infant are identical (all but one...), yet for some reason this movie is intolerably boring whereas Richard Donner's original was exciting and petrifying. In case you have seen the recent "The Hills Have Eyes" remake by Alexandre Aja, you know that remakes don't necessarily have to be unoriginal imitation, but apparently Moore and company opted for the safe route and failed miserably. Liev Schreiber totally lacks the charisma of a big budget production protagonist, but that's forgivable since he had to fill in the footsteps of no less than Gregory Peck. And although a great actress and a personal favorite, Julia Stiles is badly miscast as the poor terrorized mother. The little kid isn't nearly as uncanny as the one in the original, neither, leaving the supportive characters as the only notable merits. Mia Farrow is occasionally very freaky as the devilish nanny and the always-reliable Pete Postlethwaite impresses as a tormented priest, trying to warn everybody about the presence of the Antichrist. There's no real tension or atmosphere, the amount of gore &amp; violence is extremely disappointing and the story as it is told here is only likely to frighten young horror fanatics that refuse to watch the original because it's "too old". Bah! Definitely a movie you should avoid wasting time and money on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the Vatican observatory priest sees the appearance of a comet, the Church is sure that it confirms the eve of the Armageddon. Meanwhile, the USA President's godson Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber) is informed in the maternity in Rome by Father Spiletto (Giovanni Lombardo Radice) that his wife Katherine (Julia Stiles) has just lost her baby and she had troubles with her uterus and would not have another pregnancy. Spiletto suggests Robert that another just born child that lost her mother could be the substituted for his son, and Robert accepts the child and gives the name of Damien. Robert is promoted to ambassador in London after a tragic accident. When Damien's nanny commits suicide in his birthday party, a substitute, Mrs. Baylock (Mia Farrow), comes to work and live with the family. Along the years, Katherine realizes that Damien is evil, while Robert is contacted by Father Brennan (Pete Postlethwaite), who tells him that Damien is the son of devil. When the priest dies in a bizarre accident, the photographer Keith Jennings (David Thewlis) shows evidences to Robert that the boy is the Antichrist. They travel to the town of Megiddo to learn how the boy can be stopped.I would like to begin my review questioning director John Moore why did he remake "The Omen", a masterpiece of horror of 1976. The screenplay is exactly the same since there are few minor modifications. After watching this remake, the viewer has the sensation of Déj? vu or listening to a cover of a great band: the song we hear is the same, but the fan knows that is not the original. Of course the screenplay is excellent and the cast is great, and certainly the movie is good and entertaining. I was curious to see this film, and I am not completely disappointed but I feel sorry for a director that chooses to make an identical successful movie, following the easiest way to the success, instead of risking a movie of his own. In the future, I am sure that I will watch once again the 1976 film, but I have no intention of watching this forgettable remake again. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "A Profecia" ("The Prophecy")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nowhere close to the power of the original, but as a standalone film this is okay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As remakes go, this one of THE OMEN isn't half bad. It's well shot, with an attractive colour palette and good stunts to recommend it. Technical aspects are superior and a Macro Beltrami score adds to the experience. There are some quite horrific moments and some decent performances in the cast. Live Schreiber, an actor who I've never liked much, acquits himself well in the role of Robert Thorn; he's no Gregory Peck, but he makes a decent job of it. Julia Stiles is less assured in a somewhat bland turn as the put-upon mother, but the supporting cast make up for this. There's a raving Michael Gambon in a cameo role; a scary Mia Farrow, ageless and reminiscent of her role in ROSEMARY'S BABY as the creepy nanny, a scene-stealing Pete Postlethwaite as the mad priest, and best of all, a mannered and well-crafted turn from David Thewlis as the photographer played by David Warner in the original (Thewlis matches Warner's performance measure for measure).My main complaint, as with so many remakes, is that this one follows the original too closely. A couple of deaths are changed, but for the most part it's exact. Where's the fun in that? Why couldn't we have had a happy ending for a change? Nevertheless, this OMEN is a good film, and very much better than OMEN IV, the last sequel before this. Some of the deaths are inventive and pleasantly shocking, and the new decapitation doesn't disappoint. Sometimes things threaten to get a bit like FINAL DESTINATION but for the most part this rises above the rest as a good, old fashioned horror thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of the 1976 horror classic The Omen (1976), an American official realizes that his young son may literally be the devil incarnate.This film is a remake of the classic original from 1976, and it is a shameful and unnecessary remake. The original was scary, tense, and featured a well-written screenplay by David Seltzer, and was directed masterfully by Richard Donner. On this other hand, this film was directed by John Moore, who took Seltzer's screenplay and tried to add more action and directed it like he was putting more emphasis on the action, and we ended up with a film that lacks the thrills and the scares. Even worse, the film is technically a shot- for-shot remake, with only a few differences added in. Remaking a movie shot-for-shot is an idea that almost never works. Gus Van Sant tried that move when he did the 1998 remake of Psycho, and even he admitted that it was a bad move. Apparently, the ones who gave this movie the greenlight probably never heard that saying: "If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It!", as the original is a classic and didn't need a remake, but it got one, and we ended up with this mess.Liev Schreiber is the new Robert Thorn. He was the only thing person in the movie who seemed good in my opinion. Granted, he's not as good as Gregory Peck was in the original (well, who is), but he at least tried. On the other hand, Julie Stiles, who plays Lee Remick's role of Katharine Thorn was terrible. Lee Remick played Katharine to where we were sorry to see her go through all of the bull that she went through. Stiles however, had no such moments. She came off as very spoiled, complaining, and just overall, a nag, to the point to where we wouldn't feel sorry for her should something happen to her. And to add to that, she was too young, there should have been somebody at least in her late 30's or early 40's. Furthermore, she and Screiber are completely unconvincing as a couple, to the point where they almost cancelled each other out, talent wise.Mia Farrow plays the new Mrs. Baylock. While Farrow's heart is in the right place, she lacks the creepiness that Billie Whitelaw had in the original. The same goes with the new kid playing Damien, he just looks the part, he completely lacks the creepy factors that the kid in the original had. And like I mentioned earlier, John Moore's directing is terrible too, he puts too much emphasis on trying to make everything look flashy, which is definitely not something to do in a movie like this. Back in 1976, the original got a job well done without the technology to overuse special effects and flashiness. This film on the other hand, no...just no...And more, Jerry Goldsmith won an Oscar for his work on the original, which was very well deserved, as it was haunting and suspenseful. Marco Beltrami's score for this film doesn't have those, it comes off as rather boring and not suspenseful. All in all, this is a very shameful remake of a classic. This film doesn't induce scares or thrills, it induces groans, and even a couple of unintentionally laughs deepening on the mood. If you want a good horror film, you are much better off watching the original, as it is a far superior film with a superior cast, superior directing, and more. John Moore should have very well left alone what didn't need tweaking. So remember from this film: "If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It!"1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Omen (2006): Dir: John Moore / Cast: Liev Schreiber, Julia Stiles, Mia Farrow, David Thewlis, Pete Postlethwaite: Faithful remake to the 1976 horror masterpiece about the son of Satan entering the world parented by the American Ambassador and his wife. Strange occurrences follow as Ambassador Thorne is approached by a paranoid Priest claiming to know the actual birth right of his son. He is also approached by a photographer who made haunting discoveries that will lead Thorne on a quest that he wishes not to fulfill. Totally unnecessary remake is beautifully made and directed by John Moore who made the awful Behind Enemy Lines. Some of the differences lose their dramatic shock or payoff such as nearly every death scene, which are altered. The scene at the safari park is also a mishap here. Liev Schreiber holds strong as Robert Thorne as does Julia Stiles as his wife but filling the shoes of Gregory Peck and Lee Remick is no easy task. Mia Farrow appears as the ominous nanny promising protection to Damien. The problem here is that it is too much of a send off to her great performance in Rosemary's Baby. David Thewlis is rightly cast as the photographer out to assist Thorne with proof of his son's birth right. Pete Postlethwaite plays Father Brennan who approaches Thorne with information regarding his son's birth. Pointless but well made update remains inferior to the original. Score: 7 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reminds me of a neighbor kid . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I generally detest remakes. I'm sorry, but if it ain't broke don't fix it, or if it was already broken there's no need to smack it around. I enjoyed Richard Donner's 1976 horror classic The Omen though I can't say that I am consumed by it. The movie was a nice little time-killer but hardly a classic. What surprises me about the 2006 remake is that it doesn't make mediocrity out of mediocrity but actually improves on the original material. This is a solid film told with mood and atmosphere and characters, not from a lot of digital effects nick-nacks or that annoying "RUNT!" noise on the soundtrack that makes up most horror films, though it does have one or two.Even with some shortcomings, I have to say I really enjoyed this film because it was true to the original story. It doesn't hammer us with a lot of needless visual effects but allows the situation to come out of real life. The movie begins where The Da Vinci Code fears to tread, with astronomers from the Vatican observing three shooting stars in the sky then interpreting them as a sign that The Son of Satan is born this night. That leads to an interesting but ill-advised lecture in which the signs in the book of Revelation point to the Tsunami in Indonesa, Hurricane Katrina and the attacks of September 11th. Those scenes integrated into an entertainment film took me out of the movie because I think there are other ways to get your point across. But anyway, let's move on.Meanwhile in Rome, a baby is born to an American Ambassador and then dies. A doctor quietly informs the father Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber) that he can have the son of an unwed mother and that his wife need not know about it (I was waiting for the mother to try and figure out who the kid resembles but it never comes up). Our first clue as to Damien's troubles begin when his nanny hangs herself during his birthday party. It is a disturbing moment that, even in a remake, still works.Ominus signs bubble-up that suggest that Damien is not quite right. He's never sick, kids don't play with him, a snarling drooling rotweiler is always lurking about, zoo animals become violent in his presence, he nearly pulls his mother's hair out on his way to church and, oh yes, there's that business of his mother on the stairway balcony. It gets worse with the typical scenes of nervous priests babbling about books of the bible while trying to convince Thorn that "Your Son Must Die!!" His reaction is pretty much as a father would react, tell the nervous priest to take a hike until the bodies start stacking up then maybe consider hearing him out.After it becomes clear to Robert that his son is not quite human there is a long road trip in which he and a good-natured tabloid photographer named Jennings played by David Thewlis (who played Lupin in the third Harry Potter film) travel back to Rome to solve the mystery. The photographer is along to keep Robert on track because he's noticed that his photographs seem to portend death. A white line across his neck in one photo shows the he will die soon as well and anyone who has seen the original already knows his infamous fate.Those scenes in Rome are some of the best looking in the film, using reds and browns and light and shadow to suggest an eerie presence that is constantly shadowing them. There is a tense, very quiet scene that had me leaning forward with fascination, as Thorn and the photographer visit a half-dead priest (who could take skin-care tips from Emperor Palpatine) and ask for information. The man barely communicates but the scene proceeds almost in chilling whispers.A film like this needs an anchor and like Linda Blair who played the center of The Exorcist while still maintaining a supporting role this one includes a chillingly effective performance by little Seamus Fitzpatrick who doesn't mug but simply observes, squints, grins and looks up at his grown-up parents. He has exactly two words of dialog and for my taste that's probably more than the movie needs. His screen time gets smaller and smaller as the films progresses but what he leaves us with in the early scenes is chillingly effective.The most valuable thing that The Omen has to offer is that it isn't a splatter movie with a lot of dumbed-down scenes with things jumping out of the sides of the screen, the movie considers the situations and is more interested in displaying a tone, a mood that comes naturally from the story. There are long passages in the film with little to no dialog and when there is an action scene it's brief and to the point. I mentioned The Exorcist and this film reminds me of some of the qualities I valued from that film.There is a realistic setting with an unrealistic motivation at it's core and having grounded us in a narrative that we are familiar with, that makes the shocks resonate more. There are many deaths in this movie but the movie works it's way toward them. There are the usual impalings, be-headings, shootings, burnings but it's not used as splatter porn but as a means of reminding us what we're dealing with here.Thirty years after the original Omen, this movie stands on his it's own. It's almost shot for shot but it avoids the copy-cat catastrophe of that awful Psycho remake. Not much is tinkered with in the story department but I think the filmmakers have given us a better and scarier experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, maybe this was unfair of me, but I watched this version right after re-watching the original Omen. I really like the original. I think I first saw it when I was 10 or so, and was duly scared, finding the cemetery scene quite memorable.Oh my, the 2006 Omen was boring in comparison! Pedestrian music. Uninspired sets, apart from the apartment near the subway, but even that I'm sure I've seen used before.The director has done one impressive thing: even Pete Postlethwaite, whom I normally love, was not so great in this! What a waste of a talented cast.This director had a lot more money to spend and the art of special effects has surely improved greatly since the original, but how did he kill Mrs. Baylock? Runs her over. Uninspired.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What was the point in making this film? A remake should offer something knew but this is practically a carbon copy of the immensely superior 1976 original. Scene by scene rolls by in exactly the same order as the original and 95% of the dialogue also seems to be exactly the same. The only variation came in some of the showcase death scenes. Bafflingly the Director chose a rather more bland demise for the bed ridden wife. Where as Lee Remick was sent flying out of a Hospital window to her death in the original in this version it's just a routine bed side poisoning. In the original the photographer is decapitated by a sheet of glass flying off the back of a runaway lorry, far fetched yes but a sheet of glass will decapitate a man under the right circumstances. In this version the method is so elaborate it reminded me of the old board game Mousetrap, and ultimately what was used to deliver the final blow would in reality only have maybe broken his neck (no sharp edge).I imagine the Director is the kind of person who'd go to the Louvre and take a photograph of the Mona Lisa and then frame it and put it on his wall at home. It looks the same but it has none of the texture or genius of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the original omen was not a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>many people here are referring to the Omen as a classic movie, it was actually never regarded very highly in the 80's and it is not a classic. that word is reserved for movies like the exorcist which is vastly superior to the omen I generally don't like remakes but if they can enhance a movie that was not a masterpiece in the first place then they are worthwhile, and so I found this omen to be worthwhile and a good movie Anything with Peter Postlethwaite in it can't be that bad, he enhances every movie he appeared in and he does a tremendous job here in fact all the performances are of a high standard the Omen is quite creepy in parts especially the revelations with the photos and the tracking down of Damien's mother. There are some excellent makeup and effects, good sound and score If you think the original is a classic then try to erase it from your memory and watch this with an open mind, if you haven't seen the original then more the better</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 2006 version of the omen made to cash in on the 6/6/06 date by twentieth century fox has some bad points and some good points first the bad points Liev Shreiber and Julia Stiles are certainly not even in the same caliber as Gregory Peck and Lee Remick Marco Beltrami is no Jerry Golsmith John Moore is no Richard Donner and the omen 666 is nowhere near as great as the omen 1976 or even Damien omen II and now for the good points come to think of it there are no good points. Just kidding its actually not a terrible film the problem is the original film was just so flawless and probably my favorite horror film of all time that I cannot give an unbiased review. My advice is Hollywood should remake films that stunk and make them better not great films and make them worse and classics should never be tampered with. I f fox wanted to cash in on the 6/6/06 date they should have just re-released the original like warner bros did with The Exorcist a few years before. thats my opinion but don't go by me always make up your own mind!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the worse Remake I've seen but it still flopped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2006 version of "The Omen" isn't a badly made remake, but it can become a useless one after a while. I sat down again to watch this film and I have to say, after two years I still didn't particularly hate this film but neither liked it a lot. The story and premise are quite the same. "An ambassador believes his son is the anti-Christ". Pretty simple story. Even the original was quite simple in story telling. But a bit of mess up to my belief, I was like "how could they mess up this film?" It's beyond my understanding of how they couldn't at least do a decent job. I am going to talk about the remake's pros, cons and I will also relate to the original if I must (In most cases I will).First off, I thought the film's atmosphere was very intense, dark and creepy at times. I was very surprised at how they nearly went on the level of the original in terms of freaking someone out.I also thought that the beginning scene where a priest was looking at the starts through a telescope through space to find out that the son of the devil is coming to earth was done extremely well. I mean not just extremely well, but I mean pure perfection. The first scene of them gathering to talk about their fears was done excellently. If only the rest of the film was like that.There are a few problems which made me have a turn off from this film though. Firstly, the casting is horribly shown. Liev Schreiber is probably the worst actor in this film, playing the role of Ambassador Robert Thorn. He brings no emotion, rawness or power to his character nor does he bring any personality to him. He just really made the character bad. He destroyed him. Julia Stiles is usually good but here, she was surprisingly mediocre. It's like she never really got the proper amount of screen time or something, because she is just horribly miscast-ed in this film. The actors who play the roles of the priests, camera man, etc were OK I guess. I mean they weren't given much to do. Mia Farrow was actually OK in this film. I mean she is no Mrs. Baylock like the older actress from the 1976 version, but she was decent I guess. Now I want to talk about Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick in the role of Damien Thorn.To be honest, he was never the problem. On a positive note, he kept me tuned into the film. He was the only character throughout I actually wanted to know about more or so love. This actor is going to be good if he continues in films. I think he fitted the role perfectly. What I do have a problem with, his that they sort of made him human and they made him show emotion, making it obvious enough that he was already the anti-Christ. In the original, it becomes scary and very unpredictable because Damien in the 1976 film is innocent looking and at thought, it's like, could this kid really be killing people? It was a matter of psycho-logicalness. That's what this remake was missing drastically. Damien being isolated from everyone and not communicating with his mother and not seeing his father hardly ever is going to make it predictable. They even had that staring thing going a bit too much. Four times it was to be exact. So yes, the actor was not bad at all, but the portrayal and his evil was explained way too much.Many of the death scenes are done fairly poorly, but not to a point where I think they were terrible. The only ones I thought were zero percent effort was the nanny/hanging death and the priest impalement. Definitely not shocking nor entertaining. The others were fine, I don't have much to say because they were either the same and not shocking and if they were different, then they just were magical like the original's. For e.g., the mother's death in the remake was done in too much detail. The Original was way better because it was quick and short, creating tension.Another major problem with this film is the dialogue. Half the dialogue was the same. That made this film's outlook look horrible because we want to hear something different come out of the characters. I sure didn't want to hear nor see some of the same material again.Now one aspect I thought was done terrifically was the soundtrack score by Marco Beltrami. He gave tension and creepiness to this remake with booming, piano notes and fast, on-going music which gave some dread to the Damien character. He's no Jerry Gold Smith but he pulled it off. I'll always like Jerry Gold Smith's soundtrack better than this one but this one was good. I can guarantee it.Overall, "The Omen" Remake isn't a poorly directed remake but it is one that could have had so much more work. They had a great opportunity but they let it go to waste. I would watch this over many other remake which came just before and many after it. It's not achievable but it is a good waste of time. I also believe that it had some potential but at times it took itself off guard in what it was doing. It felt like it was all over the place.Overall, this remake will achieve a 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Die protagonist, die!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should start off by noting that I never saw the original, so I'm reviewing this film completely objectively. With that said, this is just another one of those overdone modern horror movies that are so poorly executed and contain such dry acting that you are cheering for the character's death the whole way through.The plot is a strong one. Some of the best horrors out there - The Exorcist in mind - have strong religious overtones. And no one can deny how creepy a scary child villain is. The concept of an evil son is really riveting throughout the whole movie and pushes the boundaries of 'family before all else'. As Damien grew worse and worse throughout the movie, I kept asking myself if I could really take a child's life under such circumstances. Would we really have the willpower?Unfortunately, a good plot instantly dies with bad characters and acting. The kid and photographer are the only good, believable characters. When I think of Julia Stiles, I think of The Bourne Ultimatum and Dexter where she does colourless performances. It's very much the same in The Omen, but her barren palette suits the character well.(SPOILER ALERT FOR THIS PARAGRAPH). I hate nothing more in a horror movie then unbelievable characters. The priest is just ridiculous. If you are trying to convince someone that their son is going to cause Armageddon, perhaps use less religious fear-inducing rambling and a little more logical English. He might have been a bit crazy, but no one is that stupid. But what really lost it for me is the terrible character of Robert Thorn, the great Ambassador and the even worse actor who plays him. I absolutely lost it during the car scene where Damien savagely attacks his mother. There is no possible way that a man of his intelligence would dismiss it as easily as he did. Furthermore, he chooses to smash through the gate when he could have easily told the guards that he needed to take his son to a doctor. None of this is helped by Schreiber's impossibly boring acting. When he should be crying, he has a straight face. When he should be laughing, he has a straight face. No matter how professional his character's role was, he went through an emotional roller-coaster with one ridiculous expression.Otherwise, the film has a couple of neat death scenes and frightening moments coupled with impressive cinematography in the house. It obviously has a strong plot with a lot of potential. Until I see the original version, I am left with a quality horror reduced to a modern cringe-worthy failure through unbelievable characters and acting drier than sandpaper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall Pretty Pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Omen is one of my favorite movies. So I didn't come into this remake expecting to like it. And lo and behold, I was right. The Omen follows the same plot as its original predecessor but adds a few changes to the story. For example, Mrs. Thorn(Julia Stiles) begins to suspect Damien is evil pretty early on and starts to avoid him. In fact Robert Thorn(Liev Schreiber)gets to build more of a relationship with his son then she does, and they barely share the screen for more then ten minutes. This was probably decided to make the church scene at the end more suspenseful but it leaves Katherine looking cold and generally unlikeable. There's also a few nightmare scenes that she has further fueling her paranoia towards Damien, but these come off as really cliché and unintentionally funny.The set design for this movie is pretty good but most of it looks pretty fake like you could tell it was in a studio. And it appears the director was too fond of the technique M. Night Shymalan used in The Sixth Sense and gives the color red to almost everything in the movie. Even things that are relatively useless to the scene are red.The movie claims to be a horror movie but mostly relies on jump scares to do the job of frightening the audience. In the original the soundtrack was greatly used to build suspense and tension as the victims neared their infamous deaths. In this movie the soundtrack is barely used at all and is just your basic generic horror soundtrack.The supporting cast is filled with good actors and actresses of their own right, like David Thewlis, Mia Farrow, and Pete Postlethwaite, but either because of a bad script or bad direction they don't really bring a whole lot of life into their characters to make them memorable. Mia Farrow does a pretty good job as Mrs. Baylock but doesn't come off as scary as Billie Whitelaw did in the original. And the kid they got to play Damien was just made to be way to scary. The original was scary because he was just a seemingly innocent little boy. In this one they obviously decided to make him paler then a skeleton and try to make him whisper as much as possible.This whole movie seems like a huge case of style over substance. They did their best to make the sets and cinematography look good but everything else just falls short of anything great. This isn't the worst remake I've seen, but it leaves a lot more to be desired. Not really worth a rent or a buy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>June 6, 2006 is the only reason fox decided to remake a film that was so groundbreaking and terrifiying for it's time it's considered a masterpiece to horror purists. First the bad and good of this version: The bad: Liev schreiber and Julia Stiles are no Gregory Peck and Lee Remick, John Moore is no Richard Donner,Marco Beltrami is no Jerry Golsmith (Who won an Oscar for the original) and Mia Farrow is simply miscast as the evil Mrs. Baylock as is Seamus Davey Fitzpatrick who doesn't come close to the iconic smile of little Harvey Stephens who smile in the original, chilled to the bone, Fitzpatrick looks like a child with perpetual constipation. and now for the Good: come to think of it there was nothing good to this pointless remake, if fox wanted to cash in on the 6/6/06 release date they should have re-released the original like warner bros did with The Exorcist a few years ago, granted The Exorcist had extra footage which I don't think The Omen has but they could have released 1976s The Omen with it's hit sequel 1978s Damien-Omen II which would have been better than this inferior drivel. This is only the opinion of one man, please make up your own mind</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film inevitably, as with all, has it's ups and downs. There is no such thing as a perfect film, and this one definitely has it's faults; mainly the insulting and ignorant so called English accents, and the ending was a terrible let down (Damien looks at the camera). Having never seen the original, which I now feel compelled to watch, I didn't know what to expect from this film in the slightest. I can say it had inventive, but not quite original, deaths, and the build up of the story was a little slow. I, personally hate films that start with a character knowing what's happening and trying to get other's to understand, and this continues for more than half the film. It took the gruesome death of the leading character's (Liev Schreiber) friend (played wonderfully, by the brilliant actor (David Thewlis, Lupin from the Harry Potter series) for him to finally understand his son was truly evil (took him long enough...) I would recommend this film, but not however by the sounds of it, if you enjoyed the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another money spinner from Hollywood's 'lack of imagination' department. The marketing technique was undeniably astute. However the film itself never quite sheds the impression that the whole project was nothing more than a marketing project. A strange sense of deja vu shrouds every gory set piece, each nearly identical to the original. Albeit each one is executed in slick fashion but somehow that isn't enough.Liev Schreiber is no Gregory Peck and here we lose the heart of the film. Schreiber seems half cut as he often does and lacks any charisma as a leading man.Perhaps remakes should be seen as an opportunity to reinterpret the original story not merely rehash time and time again The Omen does attempt this to an extent however it constantly returns to the 'iconic' moments of the original making its efforts seems all the more half arsed. Ultimately, for the viewer, it doesn't stand out as a worthwhile exercise.</fullReview>

I watched this recently on E4 and I still haven't made up my mind on it yet. Also it didn't help that I was getting adverts every 5 minutes!

		<fullReview>Remakes of good films are always unnecessary, remake the bad ones. Never the less, notable horrors The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) Dawn of the Dead (2004), and The Amityville Horror (2005) success paved the way for remakes of 'classic's'.The Omen (2006) is no exception, basically the same as it's 1976 predecessor there are a few tweaks to the story but the core plot remains the same, an American ambassador comes to terms with the fact his son is literally the Antichrist.It's a star studded cast including the likes of David Thewlis, Pete Postlethwaite, and Michael Gambon who give more than adequate supporting performances. Note worthy is Mia Farrow as the nanny, an elegant, intelligent and creepy Mrs. BaylockJulia Stiles is on form as the mother who senses something is wrong with her child and Liev Schreiber is excellent as the father Robert Thorn, who holds a secret about their son. It's fast paced and you see glimpse of Damien ageing from new-born via home videos. Arguably the child actor is not as menacing as the children in recent horrors but is effective enough, as most of the frivolities happen when he's not on screen.The film is superbly crafted by director John Moore, the locations and David Seltzer's well written screenplay give the film a realist weight. Even though there's some over saturated post-production lighting, the movie has a terrific ominous look, containing plenty of rain and shadows. Accompanied by Marco Beltrami's excellent music score remarkable creepy scenes include a visit to a monastery and cemetery, Thorn's meeting with Postlethwaite's priest and some eerie dream sequences.Cheap jump scares aside and without drawing comparisons to the original, The Omen is a very intriguing and entertaining horror thriller that is worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Omen remake.... why bother ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent photography and lighting, impressive range of international locations and a great cast, but as a film experience I found the movie disappointing and empty. As a lover of horror films, I know that mediocre flicks come with the territory but a landmark horror like The Omen should surely only be remade if there's a good reason. Alas, judging from the final result, that is not the case, and I suspect the producer/s have merely cashed in on a marketable title, in this age of horror remakes.The young actor playing Damian lacks menace and presence, surely the cameras should not have rolled until the right actor was found ? Nothing in this film exceeds the original, and many of the regurgitations are inferior ? the hound dogs of hell, the demonic nanny, and the shocking and bizarre deaths ? which were shocking and bizarre in the 1970's, but thirty years later, doing them exactly the same just doesn't work. You know whats coming and they don't add a twist, either visually, or in the storyline. They've just shot it again, figuring what worked in the original will work now. For me, it didn't, and I was surprised at the lack of invention ? surely a twist on what went before is the way to go with modern remakes ? The finale scene sets up a sequel but the lack of box office returns makes it unlikely. Just as well ? tame, unimaginative remakes shouldn't be rewarded with commercial success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Omen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the infant son of an American diplomat Robert Thorn dies soon after birth, Thorn (Liev Schreiber) is offered a chance to replace the dead baby with another one born at the same time. He accepts the offer to spare the pain of his unknowing wife (Julia Stiles) but later comes to understand that the decision was a big mistake: the new boy, called Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick), is the spawn of the Devil himself and after a few years tragedies start occurring in and around the family. Thorn is driven to desperate acts to set things straight again...As anyone who has seen the original 1976 film can tell by reading the description above, the plot of the remake follows the original pretty faithfully. The main difference is that the events have been updated to the 21st century and some references to politics and current events are made in an attempt to make the rise of the Devil feel more relevant to modern audiences. Otherwise the two movies are very similar: both rely on atmosphere rather than gore and focus on the Robert Thorn character more than Damien. Even the infamous kill scenes of the original film are repeated almost identically, raising the question if there was any kind of point in remaking the effort. The new film is not completely useless, however.The most memorable thing about the remake is the cinematography. The tinting of the scenes varies greatly over the course of the story; ranging from the pale, natural lighting of the mother's dreams to the cold, blue atmosphere of Italy and the green, sickly air in the church during the finale, adding to the otherworldly feel of the locations. I also liked the addition of some surprising dream sequences which provide the only real scares in the film.One thing I didn't like as much are the actors. While Schreiber handles his role with relative ease, his charisma is no match to Gregory Peck of the first film and Julia Stiles comes across as somewhat unconvincing and bland as the mother. Young Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick doesn't get to say much in his reticent role but I felt that some of his facial expressions were a little too exaggerated to ring true. David Thewlis is OK as an investigating photographer though.I may have put too much emphasis on contrasting the remake with the original film but I feel the two movies are so similar that such comparisons are justified. If you have seen the 1976 film, there's not much to discover in the remake besides the colourful cinematography. As a film of its own, the remake is watchable if not very memorable; more suspense would have been needed to make it stand out among its peers. The remake is, however, better than the disappointing sequels of the original Omen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Full Report About The Hideousness of Cloning !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The term "a complete waste of time" comes with a scary meaning this time.Firstly a slight remark : in the same year, 2006, the American cinema produced endless sequels of Horror movies such as (Tales from the Grudge), (Underworld 2: Evolution), (Open Water 2: Adrift), (Final Destination 3), (The Grudge 2), (Saw III). Prequels (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning). And, for sure, remakes (Night of the Living Dead 3D), (The Hills Have Eyes), (Black Christmas), (The Omen). Yet one "original" horror was produced (Silent Hill); which I discovered lately that it is a spin off from a video game! While that says a lot about the non-originality that the American cinema lives dangerously during the 2000s, nothing can equal the experience of watching (The Omen ? 2006). Forget about movie like (Godsend ? 2004) because here you can seriously study the consequences of *cloning* in astonishing details !_Creating with no Creation : when they bring out of all people (David Seltzer), the one who wrote the original movie of 1976, then this is odd. But when he redoes everything he already did JUST AS IT WAS, then this is spooky ! Well, according to the fact that cinema is an art that means creating and stuff, then making this movie without anything new is the real HORROR of it ! (I bet all what Seltzer did is rewriting the old script but on a computer this time not a typewriter !)._The Horrible Insolvency : Though, I had to admit it, they added different things. Yes, they did. They really did. A nightmare scene and couple of shots before 2 accidents the child makes !! And with just "new" 10 seconds you must feel fear. It's not the fear of laziness; it's the fear of perfect insolvency this movie strangely represents. Sorry, this ghost of a movie !_The Effective Sense of Boredom : since we've seen all of that before; the exact way that the child tried to kill his mom with, the exact shot length of the sequence of the babysitter's suicide, and I powerfully doubt that there are many scenes had been made, I mean remade, with the same angles, moves and performance (the scene in which the child hits his mom in the car, or the climax at the church..!???), let alone the repetition of the exact characters, dialog, situations and sets !! What a disturbing kind of weariness this movie causes for anyone has seen the original. So, these people really consider themselves artists or something ?! But who said anything about "people" ? This is maybe made by the devil!_The Question of Why ? : Why to make identical movie out of already PRESENT one ?? It's not like (Oklahoma! ? 1955) where they made 2 matching versions in parallel "one 35 mm, and one Cinerama", or (The Message ? 1976) "one with Arabian cast, and one with others". No, it's one with another cast, yet after 30 years of the first !!! I would understand it, if only the original was lost or destroyed, or if the first movie's cast were banned in certain continents. But there wasn't any of that. OK, they wanted to get money out of 2 movies instead of one. Though, this naked cloning seemed dark like Damien's murders ! I know, it was the devil work. However, with 2 sons for him, looking the same, doing the exact things, despite that one was 30 years older than the other; then.. I think the devil would be confused himself !_Bad Clone : It would be silly to say it's a well-made movie because it's a shot-by-shot remake from a well-made movie. Hence with no writing or directing was done; it's rather tasteless and absurd! Not to mention how the cast are lower than the first one. (Liev Schreiber) is talented, and did it well, but I don't see him as someone I would be highly affected by, or stand for a whole 90 minutes, so how about being in Gregory Peck's shoes as well ?! (Mia Farrow) gave nothing to a movie gave her nothing in the first place! The kid was forced to smile frightfully to end up as a child's impersonation of Jack Nicholson! And I swear that there was an intention to select actors just look like the original cast (???!!!). As you see this clone is even worse (so imagine the anger of me as someone thinks that "as good" is bad enough)._Side Effects : The envy. There must be envy. I mean when many people got paid for setting in front of a movie, coping it minutely, and then repeating it, without doing anything new, that brings the envy and makes it burning!It can fit playing "Find 10 Differences" ! And it is perfect for anyone thinks that cloning is a good thing. Just watch the 2 movies to sense the panic. Believe it or not this is uglier than Gus Van Sant's remake (Psycho ? 1998), at least in that last one there were new actors AND new colors (2 things !!). ..This is the Omen of Hollywood's end !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a big fan of the original "The Omen" I began watching the remake with avid interest. Needless to say I ended up with a bad hangover. C'mon, was it an herculean task to make a frame-to-frame copy? I guess, certain things in this world are never to be meddled with, leave alone perfecting it.Everything is bad about the remake from the word go? and it gets worse as the movie rolls by. The Damien 2006 doesn't even come close to the heels of Damien 1976. And this is not just an example by exception, the same can be said for every character. I was hoping for some noteworthy performances when I read the names like David Thewlis and Michael Gambon.The risk I foresee is that the new generation might watch this version and question the taste of their previous generation for giving "The Omen" a cult status.PS: Need to watch the original ASAP!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood Rummages Through The Back Numbers Once More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mathematics demonstrate that as there are only a finite number of musical notes; one day every possible tune will have been composed. I guess a corresponding constraint must also apply to movies, and I have the impression from the number of sequels, prequels, and sundry clones, that Hollywood has more-or-less reached that point. Only last week I got to digest the remake of a much-admired original in 'Flight Of The Phoenix'. My comments can be found elsewhere; I wasn't impressed.This time it's the turn of 'The Omen'. I should say that I was never a big fan of the original though it was an excellently crafted and well-plotted chiller with a first-rate star in the form of Gregory Peck. Maybe it's because I've grown to be a devout atheist that religion-themed movies tend to leave me feeling a little ho-hum. There are just too many unanswered - and for the most part unanswerable - questions. You either take the thing at face value or leave it. Obviously; if you're in the habit of saying prayers every night then something in the convoluted gravitas is bound to appeal. But as I say; for me it's just hokum. Still; the original had lots of Gothic creepiness. It was well-acted with shocks-a-plenty. Some implausible encounters and coincidences that would have surprised even Charles Dickens had to be glossed-over if the spell of believability wasn't to be broken. Yet, in the main, it worked. Though I still think most of its success was owed to Gregory Peck and the powerful characterisation he provided. Well; here we are 30 years on and - like the 'Phoenix' - risen again. There's absolutely nothing new. The whole thing just plods after the first, frequently treading in its very footsteps. I even glimpsed the words 'Recycled Pooch' stamped on the rottweilers' bums. There's a much-improved and slicker multi-channel sound score. Some of the photography is more ambitious too. But otherwise it's business as usual, except that there are no top-dollar stars to prop it up. This time the cast list resembles a series of anonymous anagrams with the possible exception of Pete Postlthwaite, who scuttles in and out of the shadows as if he's still running numbers for Kyser Soze. A fast-fading Mia Farrow - who's already had her own infernal brat issues - makes a suitably creepy cameo. There's even one of those tiresome endless thunderstorms - probably got cheap from a Hammer Studios fire-sale.You know it's often said that the Lord moves in mysterious ways, but does the Devil have to do the same? You'd have though he'd have worked his ticket to the contrary and been as straightforward and direct as George Spigott ('Bedazzled'). Why, for example, go to the trouble of having a builder kick his hammer so that it slips down the tiles of a roof, falls onto a corroded cafe sign, breaking the bracket off and allowing the whole gubbins to swing through 180 degrees, just in time to catch the intended victim stand-up and be decapitated. I mean - come on. You're 'avin' a laugh ain'cha? Why not just give the geezer a heart-attack? The Horned One at least has a genuine sense of humour. He'd also make an excellent snooker-player. Then again; neither God nor the Devil are a match for old Death. Just check out the tricks he gets up to in the 'Final Destination' franchise. Death: there's just no living with him.The movie is adequate as it stands (if you like this sort of thing) but 30 years of polish haven't made it shine any brighter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know remakes are rarely as good as original movies, but still, once in a while you do come across a fairly enjoyable one. The Omen is one of those. It obviously does not have the originality and ground-breaking novelty of the original (but what remake can do that???), but it does its job fairly well as a horror movie (altough the original was much more of a thriller than a horror movie). In any case, I would advise this movie to any horror fan who wants to have a good time, but would advise him not to expect a masterpiece: that's the best way to spoil one's enjoyment of a movie. Just do not expect something it is not supposed to be. Nobody claimed this one is a masterpiece, so there's no point arguing against it, is there?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 2006 remake is an almost exact replica of the original "Omen," a classic horror flick about a family that unknowingly adopts the son of Satan (i.e., Damien). Since the original 1976 version is a good movie, this one was decent as well. However, like most remakes, the director managed to remove the subtleties that made the original movie great. In the original Omen the director left uncertainty as to if Damien was really the spawn of Satan. However, keeping with the stile of most movies made in the last 20 years, the remake assumed the audience was composed of low-grade morons and removed any such ambiguity.I'll provide one example to demonstrate my point. Both movies contain a scene where Damien goes to a zoo and all the animals go crazy in his presence. In the original 1976 movie Damien looks innocent and even frightened by this. However, in the 2006 remake Damien has an evil look to him (something he has the entire movie with a touch of dark red makeup around his eyes) as he heartlessly proclaims, "They fear me." Subtle differences, but drastic in changing the movie's tone.In summary, this isn't a bad movie and stays fairly true to the original. However, if you have the option of choosing between the two? Choose the original 1976 movie. It truly is better.---That being said, why remake a perfectly fine move? I'll never know. It's not like the original "Omen" had any real need to be remade. I guess I shouldn't be surprised. I mean, it's not like Hollywood isn't constantly re-using old plots anyway. At least the movie studio didn't insult our intelligence by calling this movie by a different name like "666: the Child" (a blatant "Omen" rip-off that came out the same year as this remake).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern version of the original...nothing more, nothing less.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this a 6(66) as I did with the original. This movie was about the same as the original. I liked it just as much (that was a good shot to all you "Original" lovers I bet). The actors were great in this one as well, only 3 big name actors to speak of (Liev Schrieber, Pete Postlethwaite and Julia Stiles) and they didn't even water the movie down as a lot of horror movies with big name actors often do. The CG wasn't TOO bad. It actually gave this movie a more modernized spooky feel, which can be good with remakes (However, with movies the the remake of The Fog, it can be a flop) I'll admit the movie was not nearly as eerie or spooky as the original, but I still found this movie to be good. Some elements were changed from the original but thats what makes remakes work, the little things that are changed. I personally think Pete Postlethwaite was great as Father Brennan. He's good in every movie I see him in. I guess I would recommend this to fans of the original. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misses the point of a "remake".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented the original and the remake at the same time specifically for comparison purposes. The original was good (of course), and the remake is reasonably serviceable, but that's largely because the remake is a remake in the literal sense of the term.What the filmmakers didn't "get" here is that the term "remake" is something of a misnomer. The point of a "remake" isn't actually to make the film again, but to re-imagine it. "The Omen" is a remake in that, as others have pointed out, it follows the original film so closely that it actually does make the film again, the differences from the original being essentially inconsequential (e.g., in Kate Thorn's falling scene, Damien rides a scooter instead of a tricycle, and the falling object is a potted plant instead of a fishbowl). Even at that, some of the changes don't work -- compare the original Damien Thorn's attitude and behavior toward the dog in the house to the remade Damien Thorn's, for example, and the complete elimination of Father Brennan's death scene in the remake.In addition, the casting choices are a bit iffy. Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles are not bad actors, but casting younger actors in the roles of the Thorns doesn't work as well as Gregory Peck and Lee Remick did. That is, of course, largely because of changing business demands by Hollywood, but it still detracts from the effectiveness of the film. A more mature male lead, in particular, would have made the film much more effective, as Peck did in the original. Pete Postlethwaite, for example, an excellent though underrated actor, would probably have been better cast as Robert Thorn rather than in the minor role of Father Brennan.I'm not sorry I watched the film, because it was actually very educational for me in learning more about film criticism. I just wish that the lessons I learned had been more positive rather than negative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all due respect to the Director and Cast, this remake should have never even been attempted. It's such a poor imitation of the original and even the impressive cast couldn't save it from mediocrity. The original was made in 1976 with no real special effects, etc., and was quite a chilling spectacle coupled with its brilliant score and soundtrack. This 2006 remake was quite unremarkable and some of the plot and location revisions were somewhat disconcerting to me as well. I don't mean to imply this movie is terrible, to the contrary, it is watchable, but having seen both I was just a bit disappointed it didn't leave more of an impression on me. I've seen the original many times throughout the years and it still has the ability hold my attention. This one however has left no impression on me whatsoever. Saw it once, doubt if I'll revisit it. The Director and Cast do receive an "A" for effort though, a noble attempt that just fell a bit short. Stick with the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE OMEN: A More Humanistic Approach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remembering the 1976 new film THE OMEN this viewer recalls someone making a dog growling sound in the parking lot at movie's end and how that effect sent gasps and chills through those who had just witnessed Damien and his dogs - a sign of a thoroughly successful thriller. Now thirty years later (and having the original effect watered down by the subsequent three sequels) out comes a remake of THE OMEN and once again the story and production values of the film jolt even the more staid viewers. Armageddon now seems frightfully at hand! Though the script is essentially intact form the original version, this OMEN is cast with actors who make the story more credible because they imbue it with more humanly drawn character interpretations. Much of the power of the film lies in the superb performance by Liev Schreiber as the politically important father of a 'stillborn' son that was 'exchanged' at birth: he gives a warmth and honesty that were elusive in Gregory Peck's performance. Much the same can be said about Pete Postlethwaite's tormented priest who tries to alter the events threatened if the 'adopted' strange son Damien is allowed to mature, and to David Thewlis as the photographer who helps Schreiber's character come to grips with the decision he made about child swapping on the day of the birth of Damien. Mia Farrow, cosmetically enhanced to look oddly young, is the smarmy nanny and Michael Chabon gives a bit of class to the priest with the dreaded secrets on how to end the impending destruction if Damien is allowed to live. The weak link in the cast is Julia Stiles who here just can't seem to inhabit the role of the increasingly terrified mother of Damien: likewise the child selected to portray Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) appears more a makeup artist's vision rather than a child whose apparent normalcy could have made the evil within more terrifying.The special effects are used well as is a musical score by Marco Beltrami (though not nearly as memorable as that by Jerry Goldsmith in the original). An interesting finding is that the original 6-year-old actor portraying Damien (Harvey Stephens) is cast in a tiny part here as a tabloid reporter, giving the feeling that the spirit of Damien is still pervasive. Director John Moore gets most of right. Not a bad movie as many have stated and one that certainly could have been more powerful with some casing changes, but this film still causes the jitters in an otherwise tranquil evening!

		<fullReview>The question is ? why? Why remake a superb movie that hasn't dated at all in the last thirty years? And if you must remake it, why do it as a scene-for-scene carbon copy of the original? It's quite a surreal experience, watching this. It really is the same film that you saw back in 1976. It's almost the same dialogue, the same camera angles. There are no surprises at all, even for the new generation who probably weren't around when the first version was made but no doubt are well aware of it due to its lasting appeal and impact.That's why I'm forced to mark this one down.It's undoubtedly well made. It looks good, John Moore directs with style, Liev Scheiber and Julia Stiles provide younger but equally weighty leads to Gregory Peck and Lee Remick, Marco Beltrami's score is excellent though not as good as the original (how could it be?). But it's nothing more than a re-tread. At least the new versions of The Amityville Horror and The Wicker Man ? appalling though they were ? attempted to divert from the original story lines. This doesn't give us anything new at all. Even the death sequences are duplicates of the first ones ? which left me feeling particularly short-changed. Surely they could have updated the gore at little? The lesser characters, though well cast, are no improvement on their forerunners. Mia Farrow is devilishly cunning as the starched Mrs. Baylock, but back in '76 Billie Whitelaw didn't have the 'demon child' baggage that Farrow has, and thus worked better. As ill-fated photographer Jennings, David Thewliss is fine and loses his head more spectacularly than David Warner did, but that's the most you can say for him. Pete Postlethwaite is Father Brennan ? an actor cut very much from the same angst-ridden cloth as Pat Troughton, who did it first. Again, he's no worse but no better. Which is more than can be said for Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick in the key role of Damien. He's certainly more sinister than Harvey Stephens was in 1976, but there's the rub: Stephens came over as nothing more than a spoilt, irritating brat. And wouldn't that be the way the Anti-Christ would appear in his infant years? The modern Damien, though underplayed (rather nicely, it has to be said) by Davey-Fitzpatrick, is intelligent and evil way beyond his years, and for this reason seems less real.The only moment when this version comes even close to improving on the earlier one, is in the scene at the remote monastery in Italy. It's particularly spooky, but only serves to irritate more because it shows what the film-makers could have done with this story if they'd been prepared to attempt a completely new interpretation and perhaps had veered even further into the realms of full-blown horror.Hollywood's lack of adventurousness when it comes to big-money chillers is something that should dismay all fans of the genre. There was so much money, effort and talent put into this ? and for what?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake yet again. And again, of a horror classic.The remake factor is really starting to wear thin on me. Especially when nothing new is brought to the table. At least remakes like "The Thing" and "Dawn of the Dead" brought something a bit more tasty to the table..."The Omen" is simply a pointless, updated version of the classic (much like the 1998 "Psycho").Sure, it looks good and there's some cool moments, but was this necessary...absolutely not. The script is credited to David Seltzer, who scripted the original. All he did was pencil in the 20 years of updated history and technology and wa-la, easy money.The child they picked for Damien was well cast and leads Liev Shrieber and Julia Stiles give good performances, although not memorable,The only two things that stand out is; the return of Mia Farrow (no stranger to this fare with "Rosemary's Baby") who gives a great performance as the evil Miss Blalock, who worships Damien and protects his destiny, and Marco Beltrami's beautiful and haunting score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All-together good movie, but haven't we seen it before?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I will comment on this movie as if it is stand-alone. I'm going to pretend for a second the original 1970's horror classic was never made. That said, it was a very well-made movie. Very entertaining and unsettling. The art direction is beautiful and the story is a very creepy original horror tale. Sure, the dialog and acting could be worked on, but the direction, and storytelling almost if not completely cover up the flaws. My rating: 8 out of 10!!Now, we bring the original back into the picture and what do we have? Pretty much the same movie described in the above except you have to take out the whole "original" thing. While watching this film I felt like I was watching the original "Omen" with newer cars and computers, updated hairstyles and fashions. I couldn't help but be distracted from the movie with one burning question on my mind: was this really necessary? Beyond being totally unoriginal, and following the 1970's version almost to a tee (including some of the original dialog), magic was lost somewhere along the way. Because of this, sadly, (I say sadly because it really was a good movie) I have to give it a 5 out of 10. NOTE TO DIRECORS PLANNING TO REMAKE A CLASSIC: surprise us! We've already seen the original, now we want a REMAKE not an updating (Tim Burton did a wonderful job of this with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory).</fullReview>

The movie wasn't very scary, I think one of the scariest or more creepy parts is when the nanny is on top of the roof and she says "It's all for you Damien while hanging herself.

If however you consider Gregory Peck and Lee Remick to be film stars and their successors in this film to be merely "who the devil are they?" then don't bother.I can fully understand film makers of yesteryear whose films were full of 'special effects' looking longingly at modern technology and thinking "if only I could have used that in my film(s)" and succumbing to the temptation. (Wes Craven springs to mind.) But the Omen never was such a film. The effects were good but the greatest special effect of all, in the original, was atmosphere. This remake was pretty true to the original, in terms of content but lacked that all important atmosphere.A remake for the sake of it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, why did they have to do another remake ,but I think everyone knows the answer it was just so convenient to have an Omen released on 6/06/06 and as you see it on the DVD extras the film already had a release date before they start making it. The actors are obviously not tuned in properly , perhaps because it was very rushed. Mia Farraw of course brings a bit of creep which is very appreciable,specially in the strawberry feeding scene. Pete Postlethwaite and David Thewlis also bring a bit of life but it doesn't help the dead and fake atmosphere that much even though they are powerful actors.Obvousely all the goofs and obvious errors doesn't help either as well as the CG glass death scene of father Brennan ,I don't think it would ever work when you are trying to convince the viewers that Prague is London by adding fake street name, Sainsberry's trolley and a red post box. but after all that you can sometimes have fun with such film and just laugh along with it, which was what I did and had a bit of entertainment.I'm not against bad remakes.I think they add more value to the originals ,so bring it on lets have more and more bad remakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If it was it's own film, it would work. As a remake it's dull in comparison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this movie had been made as a new film in 2006 I would of enjoyed it much more. However, as a remake it was dull. It certainly isn't the worse in the current trend of remaking movies (The Amityville Horror can take that title!) you do have to wonder why these classic films are being remade when the end result is a poor shadow of the original films. (I'm hoping The Exorcist is not remade!).The story is pretty much the same as the original. The small Damien does not like entering a church, his mother is depressed at becoming pregnant again and his father is still a Ambassador to Britain. However, the lead characters are uninspiring. Liev Schriber, although a wonderful actor, does not do the character of Robert Thorn any justice at all. But then Gregory Peck's boots were hard to fill and I just don't think any actor could of done as good a job as him. Julia Stiles also is a let down as his wife. In fairness, Mia Farrow doesn't do a bad job as Mrs Baylock, however, she laced the menacing personality that Billie Whitelaw brought to the original film. Mia Farrow plays sweetness and light and somehow it does not work. The biggest disappointed was the young boy picked to play Damien. He seemed, (I'm sure no fault of his own) to be menacing all the way through, yet the young boy in the original movie did not do this only bringing on the scary stares and cruel face when he needed to. There is a fair distance from looking sulky and menacing and this boy failed to bridge it.The film did, however have it's good points. I liked how they included apes in the zoo scene. So distressed where they by Damien they tried to break through the glass and that was frightening in itself. And the famous scene, where Damien's previous nanny hangs herself at his birthday party is just as distressing as in the original.What I can't get over is the locations used for the England scenes. As a Brit it was annoying. The Thorns lived in a grand house. Fair enough, we have those here. But, in one scene you can see the London Eye in the distance (the huge ferris wheel on the Southbank) but if you look at the size of the house and grounds, no way would you get that much greenery on a estate that is in theory that close to central London. It's hard to get past things such as these and it does tend to get annoyed at these basic inaccuracies.I'd say that if Omen had been made in 2006 as it's own film it would of worked but when compared to the original (and you can't help but compare) this fades into oblivion. To today's gore loving audience it will be a great film, but to me, it lacks the feeling, emotion and menace of the original. It has none of the darkness of it. And I am being rude here, but Robert and Kate Thorn come across as rather smug and you don't' really care if Damien is the devil child or indeed, what happens to them as a family.If your weighing up which Omen to watch, I'd say watch the original. Or indeed, if your watching both watch the old one first and then the new one.Lets just keep our fingers crossed that they are not going to remake Omen 2 or Omen 3. That would be terrible. But I'd glady watch a remake of Omen 4. Any remake of that would be a vast improvement on the original.......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was OK, but it had no surprises since it followed closely the original, which is still a far better film. The actors, suspense(because it is not a surprise), and most importantly the musical score are not as good as the original. The death scene of Katherine and the photographer are better in this one. The hanging of the nanny gets more screen time. The priest's death is good, but I think I like the originally better.But what I don't get is why didn't they use that creepy music from the original. That was the best part of the movie. Damion was OK, but I thought the kid from the first film was creepier.FINAL VERDICT: If you really like horror movies, check this out. But just don't expect it to be as good as the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Handsome but totally pointless remake - what were they thinking????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Commercial director John Moore is a name to take note of. Mainly, to avoid his pointless remakes of superior original films. It's too bad he can't find any original material to direct, because he does have a masterly touch.He should avoid horror, however, as he's somewhat inept at delivering scares or suspense. Occasionally he hits it just right, but falls flat equally as often. Thankfully, even when he's off the mark, he's nowhere near as bad as Jan deBont, whose remake of The Haunting was an absolute travesty.Based on the original Omen screenplay and replayed almost note for note, there are only two reasons to see this version. One, if you've never seen the original and this is the only version available. And two, for the cinematography, which is the real star of this film.Director of photography Jonathan Sela's gorgeous and evocative cinematography makes this retread bearable. The acting is fine all around, and the costumes are very nicely done.The only real problem with this movie is its complete redundancy. Why Hollywood feels the need to remake classic films by master directors like Richard Donner and Robert Aldrich and Robert Wise is beyond rational comprehension, when there are so many old films that could genuinely benefit from a remake.</fullReview>

One or two deaths are slightly re-thought here, but over all this is the 1976 film with new actors, and none of them stars; except for Mia Farrow, who is enjoyable, but who doesn't come across nearly as evil as Billie Whitelaw, in the same role in the original. Right down to the ending, it is a ripoff...not needed and poorly executed. Ah well, 20th must have needed the money very much to make this film. What's next in remakes? "Gone with the Wind?"

		<shortDescription>The "Devil" You Know...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when a film like Alex Aja's THE HILLS HAVE EYES was starting to restore my faith in remakes again, along comes a movie like THE OMEN to screw it all up and prove yet again, that there really is no reason to remake a classic if you have nothing new to bring to the table.Aside from the benefits of updated technology, resulting in crisper, clearer photography and somewhat improved F/X staging, this version sadly lacks any of the scary sharpness of the original. And the very first evidence of this is in the score. Marco Beltrami is a really good composer, but c'mon! Jerry Goldsmith scored an Oscar for his contributions to the original, and with good reason. At least 85% of why audiences were wetting themselves over Damien back in the Seventies was because of that soundtrack. Any of the scenes here which slavishly reproduce parts of the original, fall with a loud 'THUD' when the new music provides none of the original's "juice." The second aspect of why this doesn't work is the casting. Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles? Good actors, yes. Will they make you forget Gregory Peck and Lee Remick? Not likely. Even the supporting cast here winds up portraying pale imitations of the original characters.Especially blatant is Michael Gambon appearing as a surrogate for the late, great Leo McKern. Gambon isn't even afforded the screen time required to make an impression as the religious archaeologist Carl Bugenhagen. David Thewlis and Pete Postlethwaite doubling for David Warner and Patrick Troughton respectively, pretty much suffer the same fate. Only Mia Farrow as the demented Mrs. Baylock comes close to equaling the scariness of the memorable Billie Whitelaw. And Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick makes a spooky stand-in for Harvey Stephens.The cynical, contemptuous effort to goose new life into an old franchise is the only reason why this movie was made...as yet another potential "cash cow." With no offense to the cast or crew, my advice to lovers of the original film? Stick with "the devil you know"...Having viewed this on HBO, I was so glad that I skipped this mess in theaters. But I still would like a refund of my two hours...well, the parts of that time I didn't find myself dozing off, that is...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to watch The Omen, very definitely stick to the original. The chinless Liev Schreibers character shows no interest in the events of this film. Julia Stiles is way way out of her depth. Her performance and therefore also the direction of the film is deplorable and as many others have commented what was the point of the remake. Surely all concerned had better things to do with their time. if I had paid full price for this rather than a cheap ebay win i feel I would have had a legal right to sue the producers for false advertising, not worth $2. Appalling and a great example of why we have passed, long ago, the golden age of Hollywood. With any luck the recent fires in the Hollywood hills may have destroyed all original copies of this waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent but Scary Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a family who had a child that could be the Devil's son, or incarnation.I haven't seen the original film so I don't know which one would be better. This film was scary, one of a few films that actually scare me. It has some decent kills. The score of the film is good and the acting by Liev Schreiber, Julia Stiles, and Mia Farrow, who is exceptionally creepy, are good in the film.What made me don't like the film as much as I want to was that for me mistaken who the main characters were, for being the movie kinda confusing, and the ending. There are some suspenseful and thrilling scenes and even some disturbing dream sequences (which I kinda got irritated by).One thing I found interesting is that how this film is very similar to Final Destination 3. It has the same idea of Final Destination 3 that I wonder who made the "picture shows clues to your death" idea because I have heard that The Omen was like the same as the original with some little changes.If you like to watch a decent, scary remake, this would be the film. Although it's not better than most horror films these days, it's still good enough for some scares for Halloween.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Five years ago senior American diplomat Robert Thorne's (Liev Schreiber) wife Katherine (Julia Stiles) had a delivery that resulted in the death of their newborn child. The thing is, she doesn't know anything about it. The hospital priest, Father Spiletto (Giovanni Lambardo Radice) convinced Robert to take and raise another child born that same night whose mother died during delivery. The child's name, Damien. (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) Years pass and Damien is happy as well as healthy. Everything appears perfect. That is until now, beginning at his birthday party where his nanny commits suicide. The occurrences continue with warnings from a strange priest, Father Brennan (Pete Poslethwaite) claiming Robert must defeat the son of the Devil. As the story progresses and more out of the normal events take place, Robert slowly begins to piece together the puzzle and realize the horrid truth. Damien is no ordinary child, he is none other than the Anti-Christ. It is then he learns that in order to stop the dreadful catastrophe yet to occur he must kill his own son. Or so who he believed to be his own.Sounds interesting doesn't it? Perhaps it might be if the exact story hadn't been told in theaters thirty years ago. There lies one of the problems with this extremely unnecessary remake of 'The Omen'. It is so similar in almost every way it's disappointingly scary. Aside from a few death scenes and an added sixteen second dream sequence, the only real difference here is the characters have cell phones, digital cameras, &amp; the internet.The other problem, the acting. It was so close to grisly it just barely slides by as mediocre. Julia Stiles certainly did not amaze by any means. It isn't until shortly before we last see her that she almost manages to get a hold of her character and begin to come through. Possibly her next role as Glenna in 'Edmond' being released next week in select theaters will suit her better and give her a chance to shine.I really wanted this remake to surpass its predetermined God-awfulness, but it didn't. Director John Moore tried to go a good job here but was unable to succeed. What he couldn't seem to grasp is when you re-make a film, you're supposed to bring and present the same feeling and likeness the initial movie contained, while still making it your own and adding your own print to it. Not rehash the same one and wrap it in a new package. He wanted to bring back a classic horror film and make it great all over again, but it didn't just happen. The fact it's practically scene for scene the same as the original is mindlessly idiotic. Heed my words, see the original 1976 'Omen', not this lousy remake. In it you'll find far better acting and an overall more enjoyable viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The good point: you will not reach the end of this film and feel ripped off. It is a competent and well made production.You will, though, reach the end of the film and think: why did they bother to remake it? It tells exactly the same story, in exactly the same way. The actors do a reasonable job (with the exception of Mia Farrow who was miscast and rather poor). The writing is essentially a copy of the original with some very minor alterations.It is a decent film with little or no reason to exist. The original had Gregory Peck, Billie Whitelaw, Leo McKern, Patrick Troughton, David Warner etc... all of whom added considerable class and creepiness. This 2006 remake has a group of actors who do creditable jobs, but just don't quite make match up to the level set by the original cast.So yes... not a bad film by any means, but nothing special.

The trailer destroyed the movie since it gives off most of the death scenes. Liev did a great job, but Julie seemed to phone in her performance. Overall I felt I was watching a high dollar-low budget remake. One thing that really stood out was the little boy, (Damien). He was creepy, but I mean this in a bad way. He either did no acting or he pulled off an Oscar worthy performance. The music was good as well as the scenery/sets. I really hope NO sequels are made.

Nonetheless, this movie acts as if it comes from the Bible and all I am saying is that very little of it is. But this can be said - God wants us to love Him above the entire world - from the profits of the Old Testament to the apostles of the New Testament (Jeremiah 31:31 "The time is coming," declares the LORD, "when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.")That being said, then is this an entertaining movie? Yes. I gave it a 7 out of 10 only b/c the script is thin in my opinion. But this movie is better than the original - from the acting to the directing. The imagery is also better. The script is true to the original version so even though there were no surprises for me I still found this version plenty scary. It had me on the edge of my seat (even though I saw the original with Gregory Peck as the Ambassador).-LD______________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/PS: may God open your eyes, may He pour His Holy Spirit into your heart so that you too will have hope in Salvation, in Jesus' name, amen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the remakes I have seen recently, this is the worst of them. It's as if the makers had already decided the original is so good, the best course of action is to copy it very closely.It's very much like a bubblegum-pop, glossy remake of a classic song: all the elements that made it great have been ignored. As for the music score, it's like trying to better a score like Jaws or Halloween. It simply can't be done!It's understandable that the acting, music score and general style might be hard to top but surely bettering the effects should be possible? Unfortunately not.In all the above cases, it's clear that they made no attempt to upstage the original in any way, unlike Dawn of the Dead or the Hills have Eyes. Either that, or from the offset, they decided it was not achievable. In which case, what was the point of the remake?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have very strong opinions about remakes - all overridden by this one key principle; if you are going to do a remake - do it because something in the original was not done too well or lacked technology to tell its story convincingly or because in it you can remake it keeping its heart while making necessary creative differences that will greatly enhance the original. None of these apply to this version of The Omen. Don't get me wrong. It is not a bad film as films go, just incredibly needless when compared with its much superior original. In fact, this film is virtually the same film as the original, almost scene by scene. Sure, there were some exterior shots done very differently, and I particularly loved the snow scenes in Italy, but as the cast scrolled past me in the beginning of the film - I knew who each actor would be playing because the actors are in many ways ringers for the original actors. Michael Gambon looks a lot like Leo McKern. David Thewlis is very similar to David Warner. Liev Schrieber does an adequate job as Robert Thorn - a man that quickly realizes he is the mortal father of the spawn of Satan. His wife is anemically played by Julia Stiles with virtually nothing to do. Mia Farrow turns in the best performance as the wicked nanny. Nice to see her acting again. All the classic scenes are done here again - the church scene seems to be almost the same frame by frame except shows much more blood. That was one obvious difference. Director John Moore does show much more violence. The movie is a quality film in terms of the director's ability, the general acting talent, the beautiful sets and locations(perhaps more impressive here than in the original), and slicker production values. What's missing then? Why was it made? One thing that immediately comes to mind for NOT being in the film is the original's haunting score. It was sorely missed here. Maybe, some of the great Hollywood minds will stop making unnecessary remakes of films that are barely 30 years old and make remakes, if that has to be, of movies that weren't done all too well in the first place. Unfortunately for The Omen, the first one is hard to beat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Late one night in the Vatican Observatory, a young priest spots a large comet flaring across the night sky. He quickly consults his father (preist), who confirms that this comet is the latest in a series of the fore signs of the Apocalypse.Back in Rome, deputy ambassador Robert Thorn is rushing to the hospital for the birth of his child. 'Apparently there are complications,' he says. When he arrives, he finds the baby has died. Heartbroken, he seeks to spare his wife the pain of the bad news, and secretly adopts another child, born at the same time. The baby has a cute red bed as well.Unbeknownst to Robert or his wife, this child is the Antichrist.After a series of grotesque and suspicious deaths, Robert begins to realize the truth--and seeks to destroy the evil.As with any John Moore picture, this movie is just marvelous to look at. The cinematography is superbly dark and blue, conveying the gloom sense of doom (alliteration intended). Jonathan Sela's use of dramatic lighting and smooth camera movement is worth giving this movie look--even if you don't like it very much.The performances by the actors were decent enough. The three male leads were the best in the film, although this isn't saying much, considering that we have Liev Schreiber, David Thewlis, and Pete Postelwaithe (sp?). The only irk I have with any actor in the film is Julia Stiles. She is a very pretty woman, and perhaps the best choice for Cate Thorn, but her acting is rather wooden. But she still passes in my book.The music by Marco Beltrami is okay in some parts, but ultimately falls into the category of 'jump scare score'. That being said, this movie is not very scary at all. It is exciting and in parts, surprising. The last ten minutes of the film are heart-throbbing, but if you've seen the original, you probably won't be surprised at all.Overall, this is one of the better remakes I've seen. It has its flaws, but it is worthy to enter my DVD collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Plagued John Moore Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Granted, I have only seen two John Moore films before watching "The Omen." And those two were "Behind Enemy Lines", and "Flight of the Phoenix." Both of these films are painfully terrible, but the problems of both films seem to have nothing to do with the director. In Behind Enemy Lines, Mr. Moore's effort was notable, but nothing could help the movie. The script, acting, and basic idea for the film were absent. The same can be said for Flight of the Phoenix. Honestly, the only thing that makes Flight watchable is the fact that Dr. House stops by for a few scenes. With "The Omen" Mr. Moore seems to have adopted a new visual style, one that's simple, dark, and haunting. Is this even the same John Moore? Because of less-than-perfect acting and plot, however, Mr. Moore is plagued again. Julia Stiles and Liev Schreiber play the wife of, and a U.S diplomat, respectively. The film opens in Italy, where Mr. Schreiber's character is the U.S Ambassador. He is walking briskly into a hospital, where his wife, Ms. Stiles, is giving birth. A doctor tells him that the baby died and that she is resting, but alive. Unbeknownst to his wife, Robert (Mr. Schreiber), swaps the dead baby for a living one, who needs parents. This, as it turns out, was not such a great idea. With a baby boy, Damian, added to the troupe, the family Thorn moves to England, where Robert is the new U.S Ambassador. Everything goes swimmingly until, on Damian's fifth birthday, his nanny kills herself by hanging off of the roof of their massive mansion. Damian seems relatively pleased with the event, or, at least, un-scarred. Soon after, a new nanny comes to visit (Mrs. Baylock, played by Mia Farrow.) She makes herself right at home, and soon invites a large black dog into the house, and engages in other mysterious doings. And then the movie really gets crazy: when the Thorns attempt to enter a church for the nanny's funeral service, Damien beings screaming, and rips a bloody hole in his mother's forehead. This is when they begin to suspect something is not quite right. All of this would be acceptable, but another element is added to the mix by the screenwriter, David Seltzer. A bunch of Italian high priests gather together with the Pope, and analyze how they know the world is going to end. They take a passage of the Bible, and apply it to the recent tragedies around the world: 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, and the Tsunami on Christmas 2005. This gives the film an angry, sadistic tone that should be saved for Damien and his father. The rest of the film is then clouded in confusion, bad writing and acting, and, most importantly, not nearly enough blood.</fullReview>

Apart from a few present-day references, and the altered death sequences of Kate (Cathy) and the photographer, this remake is nothing but a pale imitation of the original.Considering he's the focus of the film, it's surprising Damien has only about three lines in the whole thing. I concede he played the evil child pretty well considering what he had to work with, as did Mia Farrow as Mrs Baylock. But recreating a classic virtually scene for scene, minus the haunting soundtrack of the original just seems kind of pointless.And yet the things they did change didn't add to it. The zoo scene here was not a patch on the "attack of the baboons" in the original.Under-30s who haven't seen the original may well enjoy this, but for the rest of us... why bother?</fullReview>

Also, evil nannies **have** to be British. Mia Farrow is just too nice. The 1976 Damien **looks** evil, particularly when he smiles. The 2006 one simply looks like a brat, frowning all the time.There's also something to be said for older films. No mobile phones. No computer games.

I thought the original was a mediocre horror film with a lot of cheese so I was looking forward to this update. Unfortunately, the film is worse than the original despite it's interesting look. First, the screenplay was very cheesy. They kept playing that "666" angle and it got a little silly as the film progressed. Also, the pace of the film was kind of slow. At first, a slower pace is better because the viewer gets a chance to know the characters and story but keeping the same pace throughout the entire thing was a mistake. The movie just never got rolling, keeping the same slow pace with an occasional "scary" scene here and there.While director John Moore failed to make an effective horror film, he at least made it look nice. All of the shots were handled nicely and everything just looked good. So he gets points for that but he didn't create a scary atmosphere so I never felt scared nor was I ever really interested. The characters were mostly one-dimensional. Some of them were annoying while others were just bland and not memorable. The film just had no balance with these characters because some had empty expressions on their faces while other characters were really annoying. In the end, I cared for none of them.For the most part, the acting wasn't very good. Mia Farrow gave the best performance as the nanny and she had several good scenes. Liev Schreiber was okay but he was probably doing it for a paycheck since he didn't really put a lot of energy into the role. Julia Stiles was so unconvincing and all of her reactions looked and sounded fake. Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick was horrible as Damien. He may look creepy but he had no screen presence and he just created a boring character. One of the worst performances of the year, actually. David Thewlis just looked bored and it also seemed like he was doing it for a paycheck. Pete Postlethwaite was completely over the top and unconvincing. Overall, I was very disappointed with this remake. Besides for the interesting look, there's nothing noteworthy here and it's not worth a rental. Rating 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without seeing the original movie i can say that this is quite a good movie. If i had seen the original one then i'd probably say that this movie is just a copy and doesn't bring anything to the original movie. They say that it's worthless to make copies but then again if the viewer hasn't seen the original movie then it's not a big issue.They couldn't have chosen a better actress to play the nanny than Mia Farrow. It's just too bad that she doesn't get enough screen time. They could have changed her to be more evil in the end. It's just a shame that such a charismatic actress' skills weren't used. The scene in which she gets driven over just looks a bit stupid. What if she had had a gun.... would that bring anything new to the movie... probably!?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"From The Eternal Sea He Rises?" --- Father Brennan (Pete Postlethwaite)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Omen" (2006)Directed By: John MooreStarring: Liev Schreiber, Julia Stiles, Mia Farrow, David Thewlis, Pete Postlethwaite, &amp; Seamus Davey-FitzpatrickMPAA Rating: "R" (for disturbing violent content, graphic images and some language)"From the eternal sea he rises, creating armies on either shore, turning man against his brother, until man exists no more."Question: What is the reasoning behind making a shot-by-shot remake of a horror classic? If you said "easy money", then, congratulations, Hollywood has not yet fooled you with its lame excuses, such as "We are introducing a horror classic to an all-new generation". I usually do not have problems with remakes. After all, a remake does not affect the quality of the original (unlike a mediocre sequel) and I do not have a problem with this film as a whole. I have a problem with the reasoning behinds its very existence. This movie was made for money but, as much as I hate to do so, I have to recommend it. "The Omen" (2006) is almost the exact same film that was made in 1976 except with CGI-enhanced scenes, more blood/gore, and a few key scenes altered almost completely (no doubt done to surprise fans of the original). In fact, it is so close to the original that David Seltzer is credited with penning the script. He did not. He wrote the original screenplay and had very little (if any) affiliation with this remake. I recommend it because, as unoriginal as it is, "The Omen" (2006) showcases a few intriguing new (and alternate) scenes and has such a beauty about it. This is a very classy horror movie and it seems to want to generally scare its audience, rather than simply gross them out.Do I even need to go over the plot with you? While most of you know how this movie begins and ends and know the plot that strings these two together, I will still explain for those who have never met little Damien Thorn before. Robert Thorn (Schreiber) is an American official who agrees to adopt a child when his wife, Katherine (Stiles), loses hers in childbirth. He keeps the adoption a secret from his young, unassuming wife and, for the first few years of their son's life, everything seems to be going perfectly. That is until Damien's nanny commits suicide at his sixth birthday party and everything goes downhill quickly. A mysterious priest (Postlethwaite) warns Robert who fails to heed the warning--that his son is actually the Antichrist. As the people who try to help Robert and Katherine begin to die in gruesome, but seemingly accidental ways, Robert realizes that he must end his own son's life?if he is to save the world from eternal hell. Father Brennan: I was at the hospital, Mr. Thorn, the night your son was born. Robert Thorn: What do you know about my son? Father Brennan: Everything.When "The Omen" (2006) ended, I realized that it was most effective as a companion to the original--a textbook that can be used to compare the difference between films today and those of thirty years ago. You cannot watch this movie expecting anything more. However, it does stand up by itself. It is a well-made movie and, surprisingly, scary by today's standards. The changes made to the original are all fairly intriguing (although they are not nearly as good as those in the 1976 film). The blood and gore has been increased greatly (which is a testament to how our world is becoming blunted to violence). Overall, "The Omen" (2006) has one huge fault and that is that it is a remake. Had it been original, this would have been a very impressive horror film, obviously. But, I cannot help but to see this film as a child standing in the shadows of its parents?only this movie will never step out of that shadow and, to some degree, that is very unfortunate.Final Thought: Pointless, yes, but it somehow manages to warrant a watch.Overall Rating: 6/10 (B)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so I watched this movie tonight and must say I was very disappointed.After all the fanfare regarding it, I expected it to be much more disturbing then it was. I was not looking for a horror as much as a spooky head trip. It was very predictable throughout. No I have not seen the original, but i might check it out just to see what it was about it that provoked a remake. The ending of this one also gave the intense feeling of a sequel.... anyone know anything about that?OK its telling me I need 10 lines of text to submit my comment, and i really cant think of ten more lines worth of commentary on it. Hmm, OK I also watched bogeyman tonight, and was a bit more pleased with the over all spookiness of it, although the end kinda ruined it too. Julia Stiles is a really great actress, but doesn't fit this role very well.... shes more peaches and cream type acting. Leiv Schriber is also excellent, and did well in this movie. I actually think he carried it. The kid? coulda been a bit more evil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who cares about the acting? Liev Screiber is HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The original Omen (1976) is superior in terms of the acting, original concept, and the horror movie genre.Gregory Peck and lee Remick were superb. The original Omen scared me as a young kid then..and still gives me the creeps now.I think the new version of the Omen should have kept the original scenario of Katherine's death. Lee Remick being thrust out of the hospital window, falling through the top of a parked ambulance with one of the best 'death' faces after being petrified by a visiting Mrs. Baylock was Oscar caliber.In this movie, the injection of air into the IV pump would not occur (the instrument would have an audible warning), the amount of air is not enough to kill anyone..and by the way, when you flat-line..YOU ARE REALLY DEAD. You don't seize, scream or thrash around like Julia Stiles did. However, the kid who plays Damien should get kudos for the creepiest eyes around. I found him to be superior to Harvey Stephens. My next question..will there be an Omen 2? (remember the slick sequel when Damien was 13?) I hope so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did they remake this at all?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie does have it's scary moments, it's true. But the original was much spookier, and this just seems like a waste of time to me.It seems to lack a lot of the ambiance of the original that gave us all goosebumps. When thinking of adjectives for this movie, all I seem to come up with is: flat, flat, flat. In the original, I was terrified by the dogs, but in this movie, they seem almost an afterthought, no meaning or connection to anything at all.Damien was a great spooky kid, but I think that casting could have done a better job on some others. Even the suicidal nanny was nondescript and forgettable. And I don't think I could have imagined anyone less believable as the wife of the ambassador to GB than Julia Stiles. I spent every one of her scenes thinking : "What were they thinking??". Mia Farrow, however, was a great choice. All in all, there are worse things you can watch to pass the time, but please, RENT this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will you be able to enjoy this. The original with Gregory Peck, Lee Remick and Leo McKern as Boogenhagen. Could or should it have been re-made? Probably not.Anyone who saw the original "Omen" in the theater, is probably watching this with their kids,(or even grand-kids) at this point in time. Your kids may enjoy this, but the script is practically boiler-plate, right down to the Mia Farrow role leading Damien away from his mother, when she becomes irritated by the child.Farrow is pretty good, looking especially strange, although the line where she is professing to be a nanny, with no interest in men, is almost humorous.Liev Schreiber ("Manchurian Candidate", "Walking and Talking")is a very good actor, offsetting a poor performance by Julia Styles (well, she has a similar hair-do to Remick, anyway).The sets are stylized, the effects good, the religious imagery is typical, a bit scary, the dogs at least look real when they are attacking. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a film that seemed to be almost exactly like the original except for a few added scenes in the beginning and a few changes in certain important scenes. Liev Schreiber has done a good job as Robert Thorn. Julia Stiles looks too young to be Damien's mother. The acting in many key scenes suck (especially the scene where the priest tells Thorn that he witnessed Damien's birth). This scene in the original Omen was so full of tension, which was totally absent here. He looked like he was just reading out his dialogs. The entire Omen chilling background chorus chants were missing like the scene in the original just before the priest gets the steeple through his chest.The film could have been a lot better than this. If the directors plan to make a sequel, they need to reintroduce the chilling Omen background score in this.Though some scenes were better. The graveyard scene in this is better than the original. The way Jennings is decapitated in this is better.Damien does not look scary in this as compared to the original Damien (Harvey Stephens). Mia Farrow is completely lousy as Mrs. Baylock and is a total miscast. Even the dog in the original was way better. Over all, this is a waste of a remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, here's the thing about remakes. Either they're too close to the first film, like this movie, or they are so different that its hated on because "it wasn't like the first one".The 1976 omen was a richard donnor classic film. this, is a word for word copy of that film, with very little new or different, except the fact that the photographer used photoshop to look at the pictures. thats the major difference here, well, that and the opening which features footage of the world trade center and the space shuttle columbia, which to me, came off as kinda crule and cheep because it was exploiting these events.Other then that, its all the same, just new actors and locations. Which begs the question, what was the point? Wouldent it have been better if they simply remastered the old film for HD and tweaked a few effects? It would have been a bit cheeper.Overall the film is worthless. Its not fresh, or new in any way, doesn't put any major sort of spin on the story, and frankly, its borning as hell, since i knew what was coming since i saw the first film! If you seen the 1976 classic, there is no reason what so ever to watch this. Im kinda glad this was a rental from my library and didn't waste anything more then my time on this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I recommend the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I'd not seen the original I might be more inclined to think this was a disturbing movie - 'disturbing' being the goal of a good horror film. So, it is hard to judge on its own merits; but as a remake it left a lot to be desired. The film didn't flow, focusing on reenacting original scenes with a minor twist. It is an elaborate set with modern techniques woven into a foreboding past but the passion was really missing. The actors were almost repressed and one must ask if this was their direction. I'm sorry to say I was actually bored more than startled. The limited use of blood was refreshing and the clean, well-executed, um, executions, were artistic. But Damien was miscast. Davey-Fitzpatrick's demeanor and makeup looked more like the confused offspring of a Goth-inspired musician; the close-ups led no where, as if it were the mother behind the camera and not a capable director. The father seemed to be biding his time while awaiting news from his stockbroker and I kept waiting for a pie to hit him in the face or some comedic recognition of the tight lips that failed to animate when he spoke. Pete Postlethwaite was one of the few solid actors here, yet even he was unable to find any fluidity in this role. And as the camera enters what should have been one of the most disturbing moments of the film -- Father Brennan's isolated dwelling ? we are met with a scene that teeters between utter failure and over-kill. The most authentic acting came from the dogs. If you've never seen the original Omen, I think you could actually be impressed with this film on some level. But if you want the hair on the back of your neck to stand up and to leave the theater with a new respect for evil, I recommend the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was amazed that I actually quite liked this film. The Omen is(and still is)one of my favourite 'horror' films of all time and this version is merely a distraction and a completely unnecessary one and there was no need to remake a classic. That said I still thought that it was surprisingly good. The acting was good and the music was good also, although as they couldn't, or wouldn't, use the original music that was half the film not as good as the original before they even started filming! I have to say that I'm really fed up with this fashion for remakes. Most are utter rubbish and although this version of the Omen is actually the best of all the remakes so far all that means is that it is the best of a very bad lot.A major goof that I'm sure many of you will have noticed. When the car is screeching up to the church at the end of the film when Robert Thorn is going to kill Damien he passes a billboard with loads of large Czech writing on it. Strange billboard for the middle of London! This film was filmed in Prague and anyone that's been to Prague will recognise many of the landmarks. This billboard however is noticeable to anyone, whether they've been to Prague or not and a big mistake. It reinforced the notion that this is not as good as the original as that film was filmed where it was set. Bloopers are fun though!So, although I thought that this film was surprisingly OK I really do not want to see remakes of Omen 2 and 3 as I also really like them. Remake Omen 4 by all means as it can't be any worse than the one that already exists, What other remakes can we expect? The Changeling? It could never be as scary as the original. Dare I even suggest - The Exorcist? Please -----no!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really stoked to get spooked by this movie, but was very disappointed. I think I jumped MAYBE once. There was absolutely no suspense. I will say that the only thing that saved this movie for me was being able to enjoy the amazing cinematography. Julia Stiles is a very flat actor. I feel that it could have been slightly better had they hired someone who could help build the suspense of the story-line. The movie spoiled itself to everyone just by showing the trailers that they chose to show. It also seemed as if the role of Damien did not have nearly as big of a part in the movie as he should have. Nice try Fox, but I will stick with the original. At least that one plays with your head. Maybe you could learn a lesson or two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remakes usually pale in comparison to the original, and this film is no exception. The effectiveness of this production depends primarily upon the performance of the child portraying Damien; unfortunately, this part has been seriously miscast. Where evil must be evoked, there is evidence of mere petulance. Casting Farrow is interesting, but also distracting. Does the filmmaker really want our mind to wander to a far superior 'horror" film, "Rosemary's Baby," while we watch this tired retread? The two leads are fine in their roles, but fail to evoke the sympathy garnered by Peck and Remick in the original. The character of Jennings is portrayed in both versions by actors who look and behave quite similarly - intentional, I suppose.The art direction is overpowering and pretentious, pulling the viewer away from the unfolding story in an increasingly annoying fashion.I certainly cannot recommend this remake, nor do I expect theatrical sequels to follow. Likely, you'll see direct-to-video hack-jobs on the shelf within the next few years. Even the original film series suffered the indignities of "Omen III" and "IV" - the latter a schlocky cable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remake of the 1976 chiller about an ambassador &amp; his wife who come to realize that their son (switched at birth) is really the anti-Christ himself who's hell bent on growing up &amp; entering into the world of politics with plans to destroy all of mankind, unless his earthly parents can destroy him, with the help of a photographer the ambassador sets out to do just that, but it won't be easy with the child's new pet dog &amp; evil nanny guarding him &amp; more than willing to kill if necessary so that Damien can fulfill his destiny. Although this recent remake is way better than most horror movie remakes (THE FOG &amp; WHEN A STRANGER CALLS come to mind) it still falls into the trap that most horror movie remakes falls into &amp; that is this, it fails to compare to the original shocker on which it is remade, Writer David SELTZER is once again on board to handle the writing, unfortunately he comes up with nothing new, as most of the same scenes &amp; deaths are repeated here only with a tad more blood &amp; that's another problem, THE OMEN 06' comes off as almost a shot for shot remake of the 76 version, those who have seen the original will know who gets it, when &amp; how &amp; the lead actors JULIA STILES &amp; LIEV SCHREIBER are well casted, but lack the chemistry LEE REMICK &amp; GREGORY PECK had in the original &amp; the films well polished look also dampens the spookiness of the originals photography, the same can be said for the score which is nowhere near as haunting as the original films score &amp; the kid who played DAMIEN while talented, lacked the presence of young HARVEY STEVENS in the original, the direction &amp; acting is really good &amp; the scenery a is tad haunting &amp; pretty to look at, but really it's just another remake produced by Hollywood to try &amp; squeeze whatever they could from horror fans &amp; those who enjoyed the series. Better than OMEN 4 (which was really a bad remake of the original as well) but really this film is further proof that Hollywood has clearly run out of idea's for good horror movies. Horror fans may want to have a glance however, it's not to bad &amp; is pretty decent in it's own right, but like I said before, it comes off almost as a shot for shot remake &amp; there is no suspense or surprises abounding as result of it. Hopefully this remake trend will end &amp; Hollywood will start to pump out fresher idea's for this genre, but knowing Hollywood, I'm not holding my breath.*** stars</fullReview>

I think the Irish man, John Moore, just wanted to follow the success of recent remakes of '7Os horror movies, like "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and others... in order to make a bit of $! But really there are no surprises in this remake, the scenario is a mirror of the original. The music a bit ordinary and i cannot feel sorry for the Ambassador and his wife. Only Mia Farrow is the most interesting character. The Son of the Devil is exactly the same as the one in the original movie. Don't bother to watch it, even to rent it on DVD.

		<shortDescription>Why did they bother?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though the original Omen wasn't exactly Academy Award material it was a fairly good movie and seems to stand the test of time. The original had a few things going for it including, Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, David Warner and Richard Donner as director which helped this material rise to a higher level. This remake wasn't horrible but it just didn't really add anything and made me long for the original. First, the casting was pretty off. I like Liev Schreiber and really respect him as an actor but he was sorely miscast in this role and he really didn't have the charisma or screen presence of Gregory Peck. I think this might have been due to the fact that Liev seemed to play this role so void of emotion. It seemed as if nothing affected him and no matter what happened he seemed to have the same expression on his face.And Julia Stiles?? What were they thinking? I am not saying she is a bad actress but she is all of 25 which leads me to believe that she was probably 24 when this was filming. She was clearly way too young for this role. Not to mention the fact that Liev Schreiber is in his late thirties. So why didn't they cast an older actress with more experience and screen presence. My guess is that many of them wouldn't do this film. And again there is the whole issue of screen presence again. When Lee Remick played this role she was in her late thirties and was a bonified star in Hollywood.Finally, other than a few minor changes they really didn't add anything new to the material. I felt like I was watching the original but with cell phones and without the great actors. A remake is a remake but what makes a great remake is when something new is brought to it that the original didn't have or couldn't have because of when it was made. Maybe a little twist in the script or making things work that didn't work in the original, or even interesting casting. Bottom line, if you liked the original watch that again but don't waste your time with this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Omen was relatively true to the original movie with Gregory Peck that I saw in the theaters when it first came out. Gave me the willies to think that something like this could happen. This version had some very good acting with Julia Stiles as the mother role. I had hoped for a much more emotionally powerful role from Styles, but it was adequate and close to the same numb, deer in the headlights acting from Lee Remick in the original. The surreal nature must have influenced the dialog as Schreiber was rather stiff and unemotional as well. It was nice to see Mia Farrow (Rosemary's Baby) in the nanny role. Overall it was still a chiller, with good effects and cinematography. But it didn't take the story any farther than the original as I had hoped it would.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't express how excited I was about seeing the remake of this. I missed it in the theater (okay, actually, I never go see films in the theater unless really, really worth it and that is a very rare thing) and as soon as it hit the racks I was there and grabbing my copy. I clapped my greedy little paws like an excited child and began watching it. It's not bad. No, it's not bad at all. But it's also not anything better. I know remakes are hard to get good praise. I considered this and hoped I wasn't being die-hard to the original. It's true, I believe the actors, the filming, the over all quality of the original was rather awesome. I know I tend to lean towards a snobby attitude and bias towards these so with that said, I decided to be very open minded. I even enjoyed Texas Chainsaw Massacre better then the original so there. Anyway,Julie and Liev are odd for the roles I felt. Surely a miss rather than a hit. I like both actors, it's not a matter of not enjoying them or their abilities. I just think someone more powerful of a performer should've taken on the role of Robert Thorn, especially. Julia Stiles wasn't a disappointment but rather lacked an impact. If I had to think who would've better suited the roles I would say Al Pacino/Willem Dafoe/Harvey Keitel come on, anyone other than Liev (no offense Liev) and Merryl Streep or something. It felt like a very water downed version. None of the original score or a remix. Really, the score made much of the film. At least incorporate it. The black evil dog was a Shephard, which really dumbfounded me and then turned into a Rottweiler later. Okay?? Why? There were a few differences but nothing huge. Mia Farrow was a great part of saving this film. She was effectively creepy. I think her performance was the best. The graveyard scene I felt was better. There were more in-depth explanations of a few areas that the second and third film really shed light on, which I thought was smart. The scene where the priest dies wasn't as good as the original. I think the photographer's observances in this film weren't as interesting. In fact, if I had never seen the original I would've have been convinced of his ideas. It barely showed anything. With all the technology there could've been so many enhanced scenes and special effects. Another disappointment, the zoo scene.Some good points ... when Mr. Thorn runs over Mia Farrow's character. Very funny. The ending scene didn't drag out like a usual film would at the end, with typical overkill of suspense. The type where you think the bad guy is dead so you drop the weapon and then he comes back to life even though you shot his head off and his brains are crawling on the kitchen floor. He grabs a knife and attacks you again, then you REALLY kill him this time. No, this movie didn't bullshit with that. It did it's end. Thank you.Damien, I was disappointed in. Was the first one really so creepy or did he shape my ideas on what an evil boy would look like? The new Damien was like a pussy cat trying to give you a scowl. Yawn. No, he didn't scare me. The first one I knew mighty not to mess with. This one I would spank and send to bed without his Oreo cookies. He was indeed a very mock version. Especially when he overly and poorly imitated the original, sort of like American Idol. Anyway, there was some tiny added details to mix it up. No real change of anything however. No added intrigue. No alarms and no surprises. No real major highlights. Nothing that popped out and said HEY, this rocks. Nothing that really raised an eyebrow, save for the Mia scene. That was pretty amusing. So over all, I was disappointed but not enough to be angry. I chalk this one up to a film that didn't surpass it's original which is hard to do. Not impossible, but hard. I feel there was all the available means to make this film the best one possibly can, and didn't make use of it. We have 30 yrs? of technology and nothing could spin our hats around??I wouldn't give it a 5.5, that's a tad harsh, and I'm a rather harsh critic on films so I would gander around maybe a 7. It's worth the rent and the see for those of us who want more and more of The Omen and love every inch of whatever you can get. I even loved the girl child version ... so, with that said, watch it and enjoy it's reliving but don't expect any fireworks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was okay but not a patch on the original which, in my opinion, is the scariest of all time and is still a film that I cannot watch by myself. There were certain changes from the 1976 version to this one in the case of Cathy's death which has changed from her being pushed by Mrs Baylock through a hospital window to having a air bubble in her blood stream, also instigated by Mrs Baylock, but would not have been sufficient to kill her???????????? On the whole I would rate this film 5 / 10 but the original gets a 10 from me. Would be a film worth a viewing but not to expect too much when an original has just been far too good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am beginning to tire somewhat of recent remakes of older movies/TV shows. Capitalisation upon (and subsequent embellishment of) earlier source material plays upon a sense of nostalgia for its advertisement, and the perverse logic of many studios runs "If movie A worked, movie B based upon the same premise/plot/characters MUST work, no matter how shabbily it is actually made: all one need do is throw money". Alas, this does not a good movie make.I had an early exposure to The Omen: I use the word "exposure" in the sense that I had crawled out of bed just in time to see some poor chap's head be severed from his torso by a sheet of glass on a truck, before I was whisked away to bed again by parents mindful of the tender age of their son.I had therefore come to expect some sensationalist and terrifying forms of death to be presented in the remake, and I wasn't wholly disappointed. Seeing Pete Postlethwaite being turned into a human kebab was entertaining (although I like this actor: perhaps Dale Winton would have been a better candidate...) Firstly, my reasons for affording the movie 5 stars: it was a film which engendered feelings of unease and unpredictability (apart from the obvious homages, e.g. the hanging nanny). There truly was a tense atmosphere throughout, although one scene in particular deserves mention. In the graveyard the ambassador finds the graves of his actual son, killed at childbirth by satanic doctors, and of Damien's mother, a jackal. Suffice to say that a skeleton baby is a rare thing to see in cinema, however there was also the feeling (not manifested) that perhaps it would twitch, attempt to talk, open eyes long since shut. That would probably have given me sleepless nights for a month or so.However several things let the film down: although the acting is not dire (for this see Miami Vice), it is somewhat substandard and portrayals of human emotion are occasionally stunted. Furthermore the aforementioned tension which has been present throughout is dispelled in the natural (and somewhat clichéd) horror manner: the background music stops for a few seconds, the camera is still, and suddenly one is then assaulted by a viciously loud noise and a rapid appearance of (supposedly) terrifying event or sight. It's unfortunate, but in the modern world where everyone has, at least once, been subjected to a flash screamer, or a "jumpy" horror movie, this sort of thing is easily anticipated. It is still not a pleasant experience, but the edge of terror is somewhat lost. I doubt that it is being done well: take Alien for example, perhaps the most effective use of this technique was demonstrated in the ventilation shaft, as the Alien appears briefly as light is shone upon it. Today's directors seem to have lost their methods of using it to full effect. Another solution (as used in The Skeleton Key) is to have the viewers expecting the fright or shock shot, only to continually deprive them of it and maintain the tension indefinitely.All in all a movie spoilt by the fact that it is a remake. Pity: it could have been good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not an improvement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of the 1976 classic is good, and very faithfully reproduced, but it's not a patch on the original. Somehow John Moore just doesn't manage to pull off the intrinsic evil that permeated the original version, although he gives it an excellent try. Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick is an excellent actor for such a young boy but he's too cute to look evil no matter how much he tries. To me he came across as being angry rather than being evil reincarnate. If you haven't had the fortune to see the original then you'll enjoy this movie, the suspense is there in places and the plot is excellent. If you have seen the original you will still enjoy it but don't expect it to be a carbon copy - the original came across as more tense and 'evil' to me. All in all though, an excellent movie that deserves to be a hit but it will never assume the cult mantle it's forefather did.</fullReview>

It just didn't have the feel like the original,the impending doom, the evilness...I would have been disappointed had it not of been I went to see this at the discount Dollar movies. The special effects were cool but still not as suspenseful.

		<fullReview>And the number shall be, sick, sick, sick! Good grief! What was I thinking? OK, so I was bored and baby-sitting, so I decided to see this re-sludge from 1976, "The Omen". It's the original Good/Evil, Jesus/Devil claptrap which is such a worn out movie theme anyway. Making movies from stuff that doesn't exist is of course open to abuse. But this? This pointless remake? What, oh what is the point? There's just so much wrong with this movie it's not worth even writing about. I'd need a novel to cover it all. The original was funny enough, but at least it was somewhat entertaining. This is just humdrum Hollywood junk, hoping to make a buck from rehashing old movies. When is Hollywood EVER going to find out what a motor drive is and how it works on cameras? Why do ALL photographers in the movies shoot film at 5 fps, even of static objects?? It's so irritating! Aren't cameras used for making movies? The script was photocopied from the original and handed to some quite well respected actors, who then just screw it all up ? it's as if they're all bored and can't wait for lunch-break. And the kid who portrays Damien? Where did they get him from? Looks to me like they just used the Best Boy's nephew or any other kid who happened to walk by the set. As for the Thorns pretending to be in London, well, that's just laughable and insulting. We drive on the LEFT of the road in the UK. Hello? Such bad errors after 100 years of movie making. I guess they'll never learn, eh? Someone point out to me why this movie is deemed horror. Cheap parlor tricks like making an audience jump is not horror; it's stoopid and shows a lack of creativity. Apart from motor-drives on cameras, when is Hollywood EVER going to quit with 'hand-on-the-shoulder' scare tactic? Good grief, man, that is so, so boring, tedious and annoying. Movie makers seem to be going backwards. In this day and age, movies should be riveting and we should all leave any theatre feeling that we actually there, participating in the film. It should take us a few hours to get back into reality. Not so. 9 out of 10 movies released are blah, made by inexperienced kids with blah minds and even blaher imaginations. This may as well have been a remake of Lassie Come Home, which was more scary for sure. Dreadful movie, awful acting, terrible screen play, lousy directing, inaccurate scenes and overall, a tedious bore to watch. If you simply MUST throw away 2 hours of your life, this one will do it for you. Please, please, pleeezzz, do NOT remake the rest of the OMEN crapology. Spare us...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Both movies score 33 out of 50 to me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll say both movies were the same and here's why:1. The starting of the remake contains the biggest fear of mankind; the birth of the Antichrist. We get the impression of what's going on at the very beginning which we were unable to get in the Original. So; Remake 5 : 3 Original.2. Everything went fine until that annoying scene in the original movie where Robert and Katherine lost Damien. No mum and dad does something like that in a risky place where their child can die. In the remake when Katherine lost Damien, was much more realistic and enjoyable. So; Remake 5 : 0 Original. 3. In 76, Damien's first meeting with Mrs. Baylock was creepy. We were able to understand that this lady has a history when we heard "Have no fear little one. I am here to protect thee." But in this movie she seemed like a pretty nice lady to me rather than scary Mrs. Baylock. So; Remake 0 : 5 Original.4. The zoo scene was great in their own own ways in both movies. The monkey scene was much better in this one than the original. But in the original the giraffe scene was brilliant. Remake 5 : 5 Original.5. The scene when Robert was having a chat with Katherine's doctor was ridicules in the remake. The doctor didn't say anything important to him. And what was that crap about Robert asking the doctor whether he believes in God or not? I hated the scene. So; Remake 0 : 5 Original. 6. The scene in the Italian hospital, where Robert and Keith talks with the Italian nun was total crap in the remake. I didn't understand anything there. I'll say this scene was much much much better in the original. So; Remake 0 : 5 Original.7. I loved the scene where Katherine died much much more in this than the original. Katherine fell from some place that high and all she had was just a little nose bleed? Give me a break. In the book she died the way she did in the original but I'm not going to complain this because I loved the scene. Plus Keith Jennings's death was great. it was the best death I've seen in whole life.(All the death scenes were amazing.) So; Remake 5 : 1 Original.8. Now whether people call me stupid or anything I have to confess about this. I've seen the Original at least fifty times but I was never able to understand how Robert had tricked the dog and trapped it. (as far as I know dogs have much better sense and it's hard to trick them.) In this movie it was much clearer and understandable. So; Remake 5 : 1 Original.9. The scene of Baylock jumping over Robert was total nonsense in the original. We see Robert sad and on the frame and all we can see is Roberts face. All of a sudden he goes backwards and after 2 seconds we say "Oh! It's Baylock." At least this time Baylock was visible on the frame. I liked this one better than that. Plus her death was much better in this movie. I liked it when Robert speeds up his car to kill her. That's like a real horror movie. So; Remake 5 : 3 Original. 10. The ending was pretty much the same but for some reason I think the original was better. I don't know why but anyway; Remake 3 : 5 Original.Total: Remake 33 : 33 Original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good attempt with some minor flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, I never cared much for the original Omen-films. I was intrigued by the basic idea behind it but after watching them they mostly left me behind with an unsatisfying feeling, it could have been better.I thought this remake with it's 6-6-6 release date was probably more a gimmick (easy free publicity) than a serious attempt to revive the Omen-series. This weekend I went out to see it anyway and was more or less pleasantly surprised when I left the cinema (thanks to my girlfriend as she insisted seeing this movie). The atmosphere of the movie is just right, it feels creepy and genuinely unpleasant to view this in a dark cinema. That kept me glued to my seat, accept for the few moments where I jumped out of it. This is one of the few movies that caught me completely off-guard with some of its shock elements and I consider that a very good thing. The acting isn't bad either although Liev Schreiber wouldn't have been my first pick for the male lead, he just seems to static and lacks charisma for this type of "loving father in distress"-roles.Is there a downside as well ? Oh yes there is. Plot holes....lots of plot holes, after about 30 minutes the movie shifts into a higher gear and logic gets thrown out of the window in order to wrap up the story in a reasonable time. Suddenly you see the main characters in situations where you, as a viewer, do not expect them to end up in the first place. It's such a big contrast, the first half of the movie is slow and dedicated to precisely telling the story whereas in the second part you feel that the director is standing just outside of view, telling the actors to hurry up. Also, for the gore, it seems that the script borrows a little too much from the Final Destination-series which sometimes seem to overrule the satanic main theme of the movie.Overall this movie is an enjoyable experience which I can recommend to anyone who has either seen or not seen the original. If you like suspense and don't care that images are more important than storyline you will have a great time. But....somewhere deep below....there's that unsatisfying feeling again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The son of the devil turns up once more in this modern remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard they were remaking The Omen, I had a sense of disappointment. Firstly, the original film was perfectly okay, not brilliant but creepy enough by modern standards, secondly, there are few actors to match up to Gregory Peck's performance in the original. That all said, The Omen, remake, is not a bad film. Lieb Schreiber and Julia Stiles are just about believable as a modern, young American couple trying for a baby who finally end up with a creepy child that looks nothing like either of them and is actually the biblical Antichrist as told in the Book of Revelations who will bring about the end of the world. Some of the set pieces are quite nice. The journey to the monastery of Cervete is a wonderful, misty river Styx and hooded ferryman ride with a truly horrific priest/monk meeting with Thorne. There is also some good casting as well, such as that of David Thewlis as Jennings the photographer who helps Robert Thorne to understand what is going on with his son and why he is visited by mad priests and terrible accidents. Mia Farrow as the nanny Mrs Baylock is nowhere near as creepy as Billie Whitelaw, however. There was a genuine unsettling nastiness to Whitelaw's performance which Farrow doesn't quite capture, which is a pity because Farrow is a brilliant actress. In this film, she comes over as a bit madder/deranged but there is an unsettling edge of overprotection surrounding her relationship with Damien.For my money, though, Lieb does not come over quite as convincing in his portrayal as Robert Thorne, but when you've seen Peck's brilliantly, tired and worried performance in the original, its always going to be a hard one to compete with. Lieb does as well as he can but again, better casting might have helped. This is the sort of part that cries out for a Johnny Depp type actor, someone who could be utterly believable.A few things, however, do rankle about this film. One is Thewlis' photographer using chemical photography in the 21st century. Most press photographers now use digital cards for ease of transferring pictures to waiting editors. This could have so easily been updated to Thewlis examining his digital downloaded pictures on a computer screen and looking at the card in puzzlement because he thinks there's a fault with it. Somehow having developed photos seems very outdated.All in all, a good attempt. Gruesome in the right places, particularly with the deaths and creepy dream sequences but better casting and a better script might have made a better film.</fullReview>

The creepy feeling isn't there and the final scene doesn't make me want to see part 2. And there is no new part 2 and 3. It takes more than realistic death scenes and replacing pool-tables with Gameboys to remake this movie. Gregory Peck could make me think of him as an ambassador, but this WhatEverHisNameIs doesn't have that aura. Its like remaking Butch Cassidy and The Sundance kid with two unknown actors, they don't stand a chance. The original Omen trilogy is a classic. It made me read the bible.

		<shortDescription>Some worthwhile mayhem, but a redundant exercise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pointless remake of Richard Donner's original is technically superior in that the on-screen deaths are seamless, but it is slow going at times and young Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick overacts as the demonic Damien. Made to take advantage of a marketing opportunity (the date 6/6/06), John Moore's film sticks so close to the plot line of the original the sense of deja vu is deafening. As far as the mayhem goes, the hanging of the nanny has some bite, and the impaling of Father Brennan is nicely staged. Best death is the beheading of David Thewlis. Seeing his head sliced off, then having his headless corpse stagger a bit and fall, is a spot of welcome showmanship. The original and brilliant Jerry Goldsmith score is absent, although there is one brief Goldsmith cue played infrequently. Not a rotten movie, just a redundant one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time i saw the original Omen,it blew me away. Granted i was much younger at the time, and was the first real Xcert movie i had seen. But had it been the remake back then that i'd watched, i don't believe it would have had the same effect on me. The acting from everyone seemed terrible. Yet i know Pete posselthwaite and David thewlis are top draw actors. So i can only assume the script and the direction made them all seem average. Or they just turned up for the money. The extra stuff at the beginning showing 9/11 various other disasters and the pope and all that. I thought great! It's going to be more in-depth like Seltzers book. But it was sadly lacking in all departments after the opening sequence. The biggest error was obviously the score. I think even the guy they got to do it felt the same. The graveyard scene he did'not even bother to score it. My guess would be he thought. "How can you improve on perfection?" I do hope it dose'not end the guys career. But he really should have declined the opportunity. If they had got Goldsmith back to do it, it could have helped the movie. After all the original is a great film, but the music makes it a superb film. Take my advice. If you want to watch the omen. Buy the 76 version it is by far the better film. However i hope they remake the two sequels because they were as bad as this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Five years ago senior American diplomat Robert Thorne's (Liev Schreiber) wife Katherine (Julia Stiles) had a delivery that resulted in the death of their newborn child. The thing is, she doesn't know anything about it. The hospital priest, Father Spiletto (Giovanni Lambardo Radice) convinced Robert to take and raise another child born that same night whose mother died during delivery. The child's name, Damien. (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) Years pass and Damien is happy as well as healthy. Everything appears perfect. That is until now, beginning at his birthday party where his nanny commits suicide. The occurrences continue with warnings from a strange priest, Father Brennan (Pete Poslethwaite) claiming Robert must defeat the son of the Devil. As the story progresses and more out of the normal events take place, Robert slowly begins to piece together the puzzle and realize the horrid truth. Damien is no ordinary child, he is none other than the Anti-Christ. It is then he learns that in order to stop the dreadful catastrophe yet to occur he must kill his own son. Or so who he believed to be his own.Sounds interesting doesn't it? Perhaps it might be if the exact story hadn't been told in theaters thirty years ago. There lies one of the problems with this extremely unnecessary re-make of 'The Omen'. It is so similar in almost every way it's disappointingly scary. Aside from a few death scenes and an added 16 second dream sequence, the only real difference here is the characters have cell phones, digital cameras, &amp; the internet.The other problem, the acting. It was so close to grisly it just barely slides by as mediocre. Julia Stiles certainly did not amaze by any means. It isn't until shortly before we last see her that she almost manages to get a hold of her character and begin to come through. Possibly her next role as Glenna in 'Edmond' being released next week in select theaters will suit her better and give her a chance to shine.I really wanted this re-make to surpass it's predetermined God-awfulness, but it didn't. Director John Moore tried to go a good job here but was unable to succeed. What he couldn't seem to grasp is when you re-make a film, you're supposed to bring and present the same feeling and likeness the initial movie contained, while still making it your own and adding your own print to it. Not rehash the same one and wrap it in a new package. He wanted to bring back a classic horror film and make it great all over again, but it didn't just happen. The fact it's practically scene for scene the same as the original is mindlessly idiotic. Heed my words, see the original 1976 'Omen', not this lousy re-make. In it you'll find far better acting and an overall more enjoyable viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not someone who always balks at remakes, provided that they add something that the original did not have. Sadly this version of The Omen is about as pointless as the remake of Psycho. Nothing is added and nothing is reinterpreted as far as I can see. If anything, this version is somewhat tedious &amp; plodding, possibly because the story is familiar.Some people will probably find the actor for Damien more suited to a sentimental comedy than an horror film (although this is certainly no criticism of him). It may well be that anyone who is not familiar with the 1976 version will enjoy this one but, for me, I will not be scrambling to buy it, rent it or watch it on satellite TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aesthetically, the movie was nicely done. Using the color red as an indicator of important scenes was pleasing, especially when shot on a predominantly subdued background. Most of the film is shot in drab shades of grays with black and white. Unfortunately, "surprising" moments in the film thus became predictable. (Damien wearing the 3 masks, the different death scenes, the mother's spill over the railing, etc.) Call me a nitpick, but at the beginning of the film where the priests are meeting to announce "the end is near" the signs are out of sequence. It wouldn't matter so much if the screenwriter hadn't try to inject modern day events into the story. The Challenger shuttle explosion was said to occur after 9-11, when it really happened in the 80's. Maybe it's just my OCD, but whatever. Also, Julia Styles performance of the mother of the anti-Christ was as dry as a dish rag. Over all, it was a 6 or 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

If you go see it watch for the audio recording microphones that poke in and out of the scene every once in a while. Apparently they didn't have the editing money to go back in and take that out. Liev Schreiber is always fun to watch and Julia Stiles isn't bad but I think what makes it is the boy (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick). It looks like this is only his second movie but he does a great job at being silently creepy. Mia Harrow, the nanny and a great actress, was very convincing as well. If you enjoy thrillers I'd suggest checking it out but don't expect too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting is a few sequences, but overall lacking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start off by saying, I had not seen the original Omen before seeing this film. I can honestly say I'm not influenced by the original, from what seems like most of the reviews for this lackluster thriller are.The Omen, for me, was... kinda funny. When I go to see a horror film I want to feel my heart beating it's way out of my chest. All I got was some "jump" scares. At some points I found myself chuckling out loud, something most comedy films cannot do. Maybe this movie was just not my cup of tea, but I'm utterly disappointed that such a promising thriller storyline just never came to fruition.The one thing I must say that spoiled it the most for me was Damien, the anti-Christ himself. I just cannot be intimidated by a kid whose angry face looks more like a "Gosh darn it, I pooped myself" face. Throw Damien's hissy fits into the mix, which are easily overshadowed by some supermarket run-ins, and he's laughably evil. The ONLY thing I enjoyed about Damien were his eyes. As long as I ignored his "poop face" those eyes could be piercing.Some things were done right, although not many. The nanny was spooky. Her frazzled look, bony structure, and black eyes were perfect for the part, even if I didn't care for her actions later in the movie. The gore was perfect. I can't go into details, but I loved it. I'm not a blood and guts type of guy most of the time, but I waited anxiously for each death scene. The foreshadowing style leading up to these scenes were classical and done incredibly. The style in the movie was well done. The minimal style, especially concerning the dream sequences, really fit The Omen.I intend to see the original at some point, but for now, I'm not all that impressed. The movie could have had atmosphere if not for spotty casting and some chuckles stirred up by the script. Some aspects of the movie were perfect for me. I'm a stickler for art direction and cinematography, and this film had it. Only problem is, that alone cannot carry a film that should inspire some inkling of fear. Damien was laughable. I could go much harder on him and the film as a whole if I included spoilers. I don't see how anyone could rate a film like this higher than a 5. It fails at it's only responsibility, thrilling the audience. Looking at the other reviews, this film only managed to scar the original. I'm bumping it up to a four, from a two, only because it was a very stylish film full of eye candy. At least my eyes were entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor remake trying to exploit on 06.06.2006</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is yet another typically hollywoodesque attempt at cashing in at cheap things like the date June 6 2006. It lacks any suspense, and instead of trying to build up suspense or fear as the original movie did, it just tries to scare you out in a style more reminiscent of movies like Friday 13th or Scream, for example by showing all of the sudden "unexpected" images at the same time at they break a silence with a "fearsome" sound.The kid that played Damien was too cute and did not inspire fear and did not seem to be in the dark side at all.Oh, and all the supposed "signs" that the apocalypse is coming were so lame that they irritated me from the rest of the movie.Apart from this, it has a lot of quite unrealistic happenings, that are so unlike real life it's laughable.Definitely not worth it. The original was OK, this one is really bad. You will be both bored and annoyed by this one</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little more BOO juice would be nice...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a movie buff, I have seen my fair share of movies and come to watch their remakes years later. The Omen, however, is one original that I did not get to see. Perhaps this clouds my judgment on the movie in some way but perhaps it doesn't. The reason being, the main audience that are going to see this are fans of the old movie hoping to be pleased by modern filmmakers, or kids, teenagers and young adults, who just want a good scare for a measly $6.50.I went and saw The Omen a few weeks after its release and I must admit that all the talk and hype that I had heard about the movie really let me down with the final outcome of my feelings of the movie. Don't get me wrong, I didn't HATE the movie but I did enjoy other remakes better than this one (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes, Amityville Horror). Now let's discuss my reasons...1.) Not enough scares. Judging from the previews, it seems that there will be "jumpy" scenes littered throughout the movie but in fact there are only a few scenes that cause you to grab the person next to you, and a few more that make you cringe away if you have a weak constitution. The scenes that do startle you have enough boo juice (as I like to call it) to get your heart rate accelerated. I just wish there were more of them.2.) Phenomenal cast. I really enjoyed the filmmakers' choice for the cast. Granted Julia Stiles, I feel, didn't do the best job she could have done but I felt that Liev Schreiber really did a great job as Robert Thorn and you could even see and hear a whisper of Gregory Peck's performance. The Bristish cast was first-rate as well. The scenes with Pete Postlethwaite's character are well performed as well as David Thewlis (my favorite character in the movie) and Michael Gambon. Newcomer Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick has also won a new place in my heart as one of the creepiest, most villainous children I have ever seen in a movie. I mean he's worst than Dakota Fanning...and she gives me nightmares sometimes...3.) Minor plot holes. It seems that during the course of the movie there are a few details mentioned but are never returned upon or elaborated on. Whether this was intentional or lazy writing, it isn't made very apparent. Granted a movie can only hold so much before the audience gets bored or doesn't care but it would still be nice if a few things were touched up on.That's all really that I have to say about this remake. Although there seems to be a black and white with no gray area for this movie, this summer scare lands firmly in the gray for me. I didn't hate it and I didn't love it either. Would I see it again? Not if I had to pay for the ticket. Is it going to become a new addition to my DVD collection when it's released? Most likely...gotta love those bonus materials!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(Attempted) Style over Substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to seeing this version of The Omen, as the original is a favorite of mine and I was intrigued as to what John Moore could bring to the table. So I was somewhat surprised at how annoyed I felt at the end. This film is like a Big Mac - kind of fun in parts, but leaving you hollow and hungry moments later. First off, the cast. Overall, it was well cast, but Julia Stiles was a poor choice, her acting is fine, but she's just too young for this role. And as much as I love David Thewlis' work, having him decipher the biblical passages made me relapse into happy memories of him as Johnny in 'Naked' - "Are yer familiar with the book of revelations...?" What really got my goat though, was the direction. Moore obviously saw this as his opportunity to stamp his 'auteur' mark all over this - and it comes off second rate. The symbolic layers are not very deep (though I loved Damien's funky wallpaper), and enough with the red already! This was trite when M. Night did it to death - here it is as subtle as a scarlet ferret in your pants. 'Less is more' could be the mantra for the palette. It really felt as if some scenes were lovingly designed just for their style, forget plot enhancement, and don't get me started on the cinematographic choices. It worked fine for the dog attack in the graveyard, not for the stroll through the marketplace. It's annoying because I had high hopes for this movie. So now I ask myself, why is the original so much better? In a nutshell, substance over style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright I have really mixed thoughts on this movie. I saw it yesterday 6/6/06, you know for the heck of it. First off it was jam packed, good thing I got connections to get in Now to how the movie was.The scenery was really good, it kept it in a spooky mood throughout the whole movie. But the acting seriously messed the movie up. Every time someone tried being serious it didn't work. Also everyone in the theater laughed at the facial expressions each other actors did, it was brutal.Next was the directing. Some points were random and had nothing to do with the movie at all, also they tried hiding little cool things in the scenery. Like in Damiens bedroom, he has 666 wallpaper. There were 4 parts that made people scream and jump. There were at least 13 parts that made people laugh, and 1 part that made me laugh so hard I started crying. 1 part was cool and a nice little gory scene. Also they start one scene with a guys face all fine, then the next shot he has glass and blood in his face....It was weird.So overall, the movie was alight. It picked up at the second half, but the movie does make you think a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty pointless, but manages to be enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of the 1976 horror classic with Gregory Peck.The story here is exactly the same - Robert Thorn's son is born in the early morning on June 6. The boy is quiet and keeps to himself and on his 6th birthday, strange things start to happen. First a nanny commits suicide, a weird black dog shows up, and even a seemingly crazy priest tells Robert Thorn that his son is really the son of the devil. He, of course, doesn't believe a word until the evidence seems to be irrefutable.Of all the film's that didn't need a remake, Richard Donner's "The Omen" was probably at the top of the list. It was a such a well executed horror film that the saying "if it ain't broke don't fix it" seems to have been made just for it. The results that John Moore has crafted here pretty much confirm that statement, but his version isn't wholly bad and even enjoyable.A few things that Moore has spiced up are the effects, the insertion of a few nightmare scenes, and a general glossiness from beginning to end. The updated effects are most apparent in the infamous death scene of the priest and in a beheading later in the film. The scenes are just like in the original, really, and just contain a few extra money shots, so they are entertaining, but "update" in a pretty literal sense, not re-imagined, just updated. Then there is best thing about this version - a few nightmare scenes inserted throughout and they provide the film's best jump scares.A problem is that many pulse pounding scenes from the original have been dropped or seriously down played for some inexplicable reason. A beheading scene in the original was tense, built up to, and played out with slow motion and yielded a great tension. Here Moore resorts to digital effects and the timing of the scene is: BAM and it's over. In fact, many scenes seem to play out like this: a quick dose of brutality at the cost of tension and suspense. However, then there are some scenes that were violent in the original, but Moore plays them out with suspense and tension in this version.So despite being a remake that seems to have been made only to be released on 6/6/06, the said differences make it more enjoyable than if it were a real frame-by-frame remake would have been as they provide some unexpected moments. Also Marco Beltrami's main theme is quite good.On a final note, in light of recent remakes such as "The Fog" this is a work of genius. 6/10Rated R: horror violence</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed Omen from '76 very much. I always liked movies about Armageddon, devil, Satan etc - and I thought an up-to-date remake of such a great movie would be an amazing thing. But I didn't expect anything that bad... The screenplay is like 99% the same as in the original movie. I know remakes are remakes and cant introduce any spectacular changes but in my opinion these are just THE SAME movies - there are other actors and action is set about 30 years later but if someone has seen the original Omen, wont be satisfied with this production. Having todays technology - computers, digital cameras, special effects this movie could have been done really A LOT better. I think in the 70s the director didn't have the possibilities Moore had- and didn't take advantage of. Don't waste your money on the ticket - instead, go to Blockbuster and rent the old one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time I go to the video store, I walked pass the original many times and considered picking it up but was too scared(I'm somewhat apprehensive abt horror movies). When the remake came out, I finally decided to watch this, but was torn between the original or the remake. I picked the remake cause I was lured in by its cleverly edited trailer(in fact, I thought the trailer was so good and gave away the story so much that they might as well have forgot abt the other 105 minutes...and another goof: some of the scenes in the trailer was actually deleted from the movie.).It wasn't scary at all, but I could've died of an heart attack at some parts when there was a sudden burst of action when you least expected it. it wasn't scary, just jumpy.*Edit: Actually, the only thing that scared me a bit was the bathroom scene where everything seemed clean and white yet really suspicious. I thought after that the pace and scariness was going to build up from there...but it didn't, it just totally lacked momentum because it jumped from one event to another without much significant connection(IE. bad directing.).The suspense was good though, i bit my finger when Mia farrow injected air(i think?) into styles drip thing and you had to watch it slowly slowly move up while the music builds and you're thinking "is someone going to come in at the last minute? is she going to die?"The deaths were predictable, and graphically it was boring, for people who loves blood and guts. They are quite interesting however and as many people have said, it is a lot like final destination-ish deaths, whereby the audience are given obvious clues/list of who will die next. and i think that this really didn't give much guidance to the story, no where did any of the characters say, "he died because he was a threat" or because Damien and the forces of darkness didn't like them for one reason or another. all they said was, "he died because he was marked" which was a huge DUH on the audiences part.I don't know how close it followed the original script wise cause I haven't watched it, but I thought the revelation of events was done too hastily, probably because they deleted a lot of scenes. for example, when Katherine wakes up from that dream where she's in her bathroom, she goes down stairs to investigate..investigate what? How did she know Damien or something was downstairs? Was there a noise? The dream obviously prompt her intuition to go...it might be trivial but there's a lot of these kind of trips in the movie that makes it kind of hard to decipher the story.which brings me to the story. having watched all of the trailers(in which a dramatic poem is recited over a dramatic sequence of shots. i especially liked that shot where the camera was pulling back from the house covered with crucifixes which they cut from the movie), i had expected that there was a higher purpose in the necessity in killing Damien, and since it was about the Antichrist which had to do with religion, i believed so. but i was wrong. although the movie did make points about Armageddon and how disaster will fall upon the world, it mostly revolved around how Damien was evil and that he was evil because he was evil. it just left me morally bankrupt. and for the record, Damien seemed pretty useless as the Antichrist. but i guess its just suppose to be a horror movie so i guess ill forget that.Ihad expected Damien to be lovable...evil, creepy, but lovable or at least likable. because he was the coolio dude man, the Antichrist, mess with him and he'll bust ya cap yo..but Damien just turned out to be a god damned brat that i just wanted to punch in the gonads.Ratings(as a horror movie): for the gore lover: 5/10 for surprise scare addicts: 7/10 for creepiness: 3/10 for suspense hunters: 7.7/10 for atmospherics: 7.2/10(the colour red was a consistent feature in every scene, and it was in London, meaning lots of overcast) interestingness of the death scenes: 6.5/10(cept for the decapitation, which, by the way, was ironically the most boasted aspect of the film back in the day.) for smartness/predictability/mystery: 6.3/10(well it wasn't a slasher film if thats what u mean.) for the special effects/costume/makeup: 4/10..even at the scariest scenes, it failed horrendously.Ratings(as a film): directing: 6.5/10 production: 7/10 acting: 6.5/10 cinematography: 7.5/10 sound/music: 7/10All in all, its not a very raw and unique film of its genre. in fact the remake has turned the original classic into a cheap, toned down Hollywood thriller.I wish id just brought the original home for 13 dollars less...ALTHOUGH, during the previews i saw "The Descent" trailer...and now i want to go watch that. i guess every cloud has a silver lining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visually brilliant and entertaining, BUT completely unnecessary remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I'm not personally a big fan of remakes I believe the only justification for making one is when the filmmakers have something new to add to the movie or want to give the movie a so called upgrade (especially in the case of scifi or action movie where a lot more can be done thanks to modern technology).Which is why fully knowing that this is a legendary horror movie and having seen the original I automatically lowered my expectations when I went in to see this movie.As I suspected this movie violated the cardinal sin of making a remake which added nothing new to the original, it is quite clear that the studios wanted to cash in on the special date 06/06/06 that presented itself.This movie has nothing new to add to the omen , the flow of events and the concept of the movie is identical to the original.The casting is so-so, the extra young ambassador to england is hard to digest and the only character who was perfect was Mia Farrow as Mrs Baylock and David Thewlis as the photographer . Lets face it though, its not like Julia stiles and Liev Schreiber are comparable to the like of Gregory Peck.The acting is really good and though Mia farrow was cast perfectly unfortunately her character was way to loud and like Damian any one would just look at the way she behaves and know something was wrong. The show was clearly stolen by Thewlis who looks and acts his part perfectly.Comparisons to the original can takes days and pages hence I will comment only on 3 major points.1)While the original revolved around Damian who was mostly confused and largely unaware of who he was and the powers he possessed (he only learns about it in the second part as young boy) this Damian is fully aware of it and that takes away most of the charm of the original.Hence instead of the plot and Damian's identity unraveling before us we are subjected to an evil scheming Damian from the beginning of the movie. Its stupidly obvious that he his evil, the child cast as Damian looks like a brat , acts like one, and has none of the innocence associated with the original (you actually feel bad for Damian for the entire movie for unfortunately being who he is). THUS ONE OF THE MOST LEGENDARY SCENES WHERE A SEEMINGLY UNFORTUNATE BOY TURNS AROUND AT SMILES AT HIS PARENTS FUNERAL REVEALING HIS EVIL IS COMPLETELY WASTED. This particular scene left a haunting impression on me as a child ( left me with a fear of the dark for nearly 10 years and i cried and puked out of fear for 2 weeks after i saw this movie in fact post this period i have never felt fear in a film again also realised why children should not see horror films hehe).Not as important but mentionable was the scene where the photographer realises what was happening and takes his own photo, that scene and the horror associated with it (knowing how you will die) was far better in the original.2)The legendary background score which was made the original special was missed throughout the movie. Even though the background score here was very very good it was ordinary in comparison to the haunting score of the original.DUE TO THESE FACTORS THIS MOVIE LACKS THE CONSTANT TENSION ONE FEELS IN THE ORIGINAL.3)The only aspect where this movie was AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL though slightly different was the cinematography and visuals , the movie has breathtaking and mesmerising visuals. The cold bleakness of London, the loneliness of the mansion, the paranoia of the priest, the holiness of Jerusalem, the stormy rainy day, the deliberate mishaps, each and every scene was near perfect. I've not seen such a visually pleasing movie in a long time. This movie is literally a pictographic orgy.Another question that one thinks of is why make a movie based on the prophecies of the bible when nowadays (thanks to the DA vinci code) people are questioning the absolute authenticity of the bible and whether we should be adhering to it so religiously.In todays world the justification and authentication for the prophecy seems like a conspiracy theory and is hardly believable.Nevertheless the entertainment value of the movie is unquestionable and though I would still recommend one watch the original (i still feel they were better of re-releasing a digitally mastered original) this movie can be watched.Be sure to go in with lowered expectations and an open mind.P.S if you are cinema student or lover you have to see this movie only because of the stunning visuals.+s breathtaking visuals (i mean breathtaking), good background score, good acting especially from thewlis, a few genuinely scary and tense moments.+/- Mia farrow, the boy who plays Damian, background score not as good as the original -s lacks the constant tension, Damian is evil from the beginning, so-so casting,totally unnecessary remake as nothing new was added, to few scary and tense scenes.total 4.5/5 on ten (in absolute terms this movie is a 7 which is rare considering its a remake it looses the points despite lowering expectations because it was an unnecessary remake)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shoddy execution, puts "The Omen" in neutral.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Releasing on the same date that bares the number of its pedigree. "The Omen" is met with high anticipation. Director John Moore, shows his talent and this genre. However, a slightly shoddy execution, parks the whole film in neutral.Beginning with a husband ( played by Liev Schreiber in a rather mixed performance ) who has learned that his wife, who is unaware of the tragedy, has lost there baby during child birth. But threw fate, he is offered another child who is without a family. So threw the husband the couple takes the young baby boy, and threw time they grow as a happy family.These scenes of showing the family growing together over time, is a told very well. Making the climax of the story even more exciting. However, upon the boy coming of age. His mother starts to become paranoid threw moment when she is being terrorized mentally by the child. Along with that, and moments that spread strange notions of there child. There whole world is completely turns upside down when a priest tells them that there child is the Antichrist.Director John Moore, tells the story very well for the most part. The film looks very good. And save for some very particular moments, the acting and characters are completely satisfactory. The only character that leads away from the pack, is the husband played by Liev Schreiber. He nails the emotional scenes that are crucial to the story very well. However, for the most part, he delivers a rather unbelievable and stale performance.Many of the moments of pure terror that comes from the film, are done very well. And none of them stoop to the by-the-number scares that movies these days fall upon.But where the movie begins to fall apart is its execution. The film during its most important parts is very well done. However, some scenes that are equally crucial to the story are thrown to the waist side, and in the end mean almost nothing. One sequence that lends to this, is when a women sacrifices herself for the child. The point is left questionable. And the story goes on like, this moment that is crucial, never happened. There is some of that hear and there threw-out the story. And it makes it pretty disjointed in the end.There are also many very strange moments of camp. Some of the death scenes in the movie really seem very out of place in a story that is supposed to be a suspense/thriller. However, they come off as being a scene that would have came out of a rather campy horror film.There are many nit-picks here and there that are completely worth mentioning. However, the story at its core is not a bad one. The writing is done very well, and the story is told in a very well done fashion when it works. However, the problems show themselves much more then they should have making a story that is decent, but not wholly satisfying.At its core "The Omen" is a very ambitious thriller. Taking a rather interesting story, and telling it in a very decent way. However, a rather mixed execution, makes for a rather mixed experience. Making "The Omen" half-sour, and equally half-sweet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So you want to remake a horror flick?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why did I go and see this movie? My first clue to avoid it was that it's rated R. The second clue is that they are proud of the number "666" the mark of the beast, so I guess what drove me was the theological curiosity, as many movies are pretty deep into the bible, especially in reference to the book of Revelation. But this movie was just a horror flick, with a usual horror flick kind of plot. The kid is your usual spoiled little brat, as most children with bad parenting are. This kid's only excuse was that he was the devil himself, otherwise he's just like every other bratty kid. I've seen many times where Nannies were nearly driven to suicide by the kids they took care of, so big deal... Creepy sound effects accompanied by goofy situations, it's all relative to the plot.I give this film 2 stars (out of 5) because the acting was good. There was a story line and it did keep me interested. I suppose I should now see the original 'Omen' film from the '70's and base my judgment on this film from that one. Fortunately, the matinée at the mall left me an entire theater to myself, so I felt like I was given the special treatment of a film critic.One of the actors, David Thewlis, plays as 'Keith Jennings', the wayward paparazzi. I recognized Thewlis from his role in 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' as 'Professor Remus Lupin', Professor by day, Werewolf by night. Quite fitting for this role, I'd say...Meanwhile, the moral of this story is, no matter how cute they are, if they're not your kids, they'll turn out to be evil.</fullReview>

The atmosphere was very effective on the big screen but having seen the first movie, not as effective for meThe little boy was supposed to be captivating and scary, but I didn't feel it. Another child actor introduction that will die a natural death. His mom however was another story. She really looked scared when she realized what she had for a son. The dad was also good although no Gregory Peck. I thought it was worth the matinée price and if you never saw the first move, this is good enough.

The acting is okay, but the whole film is just a clone of the original, with no surprises at all. Sure, if you have not seen the first film, then you will enjoy this, but if you have, don't bother to watch this. I am astonished at how easily it seems to get the millions to produce such a unoriginal script, and as for the director John Moore, the man completely lacks imagination. At no point does he say to himself, 'How can I improve on the original film?' A waste of five pounds entrance fee.</fullReview>

It stars Julia Stiles and Liev Schreiber as the parents for this disturbing child. This disturbing child is played by Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick, who is brand new in the movie industry. It basically starts off with Katharine (Stiles) in the hospital bed and Robert (Schreiber) getting the most horrifying news anyone can hear: his newborn baby just passed. For the sake of his wife, a priest introduces him to a baby and Katharine will never know if that is her baby or not. Robert is basically the only one who knows about this and doesn't want to say anything about it. Five years go on by and this is when Damien starts acting like a different kid and this is when Katharine feels like Damien isn't her child. She begins to have nightmares about him.The famous scene is of course in this movie when Damien knocks his mother off the i don't know, 3rd floor? I didn't see the original movie but everyone saw the famous scene. In the original, Damien was riding this small Fisher Price bike and knocks his mother off. In this movie, it's more updated, he knocks her over with a Scooter which is more powerful to knock her over.I think the cast was good. There were some good performances and this movie makes you hate many people and feel sorry for some. Julia Stiles gave a good performance. The young boy who played Damien only said about 10 words in this movie. I think that is a good idea. He needs to be scary and frightening and making him talk would kill that. So I thought that was a good idea not to make him talk.So The Omen is a fun ride that makes you disturbed, freaked out and as I said, this is a fun movie. It's low on terror, I've seen scarier movies but then again, not every horror film has to be scary. So I would give this movie a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

They said that the Tsunami, 9/11 were works of some evil satanic thing, I lost two of my best friends in the Tsunami and I will never ever believe that they died because of some evil organization with The devil."and the rise of the roman empire..." was the EU.I had many problems with the logic, because there were none.But if you look at it as a movie and not a documentary, it's pretty scary.It's not better then "omen" from '76 and "omen" weren't good at all...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I saw the beastly thing: Its number is: sucks sucks sucks..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone else commenting says: this remake is good if you haven't seen the original... but really that is like saying this film is good if you have never seen any film before. I saw "the (eek) original" in 1976 and thought that was pretty trashy; my theory on aging stars making silly dramas like this is that they need some quick cash to buy a holiday house. eg: Michael Caine in JAWS 4 and Gregory Peck in ... woops... THE OMEN. As a word for word remake this new version is like FLYING HIGH (Airplane!) is to ZERO HOUR. .. and just as enjoyable. Every scene with Daniel Thelewis and Leif Schrieber together looked as though when the director yelled 'CUT!" they both fell onto each other hissing with laughter, one perhaps quietly mumbling "Here comes another twenty grand". Particularly in the scenes in Father Brennan's "Beautiful Mind" catacomb quarters where the camera shows us bible pages stapled everywhere: "look, bible pages" says Thelewis. The camera then shows lots of crucifixes... 'Look, lots of crucifixes" he adds. "And I accidentally saw myself in a mirror taking a shot" followed by a hilarious 'fashion shoot' shot of himself in a gilt edge mirror. By the time they get to Italy again and meet what looks like Gary Oldman in melted turtle face makeup last seen in HANNIBAL and film have what must have been the end result of an off set bender with Michael Gambon, The Omen 666 is teetering into 'Oh! Man! sucks sucks sucks" territory. Look, I laughed a lot and managed not to flinch when the obligatory screeching came from the side speakers. Favourite part: Mia Farrow running amok like Carrie's mother, wielding a sledgehammer. I loved the humor of her casting, but where was Karen Black who really deserved a gig as the first Nanny, swinging from the yardarm at the kids birthday party. As my last name is Brennan, you can imagine the fun I had being referred to as mad and weird all through this. And, what's with the casting of Julia Stiles when she looks like Chucky in a Jackie Kennedy outfit?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this movie 4 because I think it is not nice to give any movie a zero. Although I didn't like it but still some efforts were done to shot it. OK, I didn't like anything about the movie with a small exception. Only thing i liked is the performance of Liev Schreiber as an actor. Old consumed story about a legend, an attempt to make a thrill movie which really fails. Poor scenario and very primitive for a 2006 movie. His wife Julia Stiles role was very pathetic. All characters were really almost not effective in the movie. The way the wife was killed was strangely far from convincing. The nanny injects air in the blood. I don't think this works. it was more convincing to do something else to seem like an accident. That would have been in sync with all other murders - by the devil - in the movie. Amazingly the maid walked away and no one figured out the crime!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carbon Copy Of The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a very rare venture into the cinema,I sat through this film due to the fact that I am a fan of the original Omen trilogy.I was expecting something a little different but this film was almost identical to the original. Apart from a few differences in the details, for example, when Damien was getting on his mum's nerves with the snooker balls in the original, - in this version, he was getting on her nerves with an electronic game. The scene when Damien's mum fell off the landing after the goldfish bowl had come crashing down; - this time the goldfish bowl was replaced by a pot plant and Damien was riding a micro-scooter instead of the kiddie's bike he was riding in the original.I'm not a fan of remakes, so I shouldn't be surprised that this film failed to impress me.I thought the decapitation scene was very well done though, but it did make me question the 12A certificate rating as it was rather gruesome.The Damien child didn't look half as evil as the kid in the original either and Mia Farrow was terrible as Damien's Satanic nanny, Mrs Baylock.I'm pleased I have seen this film but a bit upset over losing ?5.50 to watch this poor relation of the original.I definitely will not be buying the DVD and will stick with the much more superior original.Poor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely unnecessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not a bad movie in itself, The Omen 666 has really no right to exist. Being a remake of the 70's classic, the movie does not add anything new to the myth. In fact, recreating a movie that relied on suspense and shock scene by scene is a really bad idea, just like that "faithful" Psycho remake they did a while ago. The actors walk through this more or less stony faced, with the exception of Mia Farrow whose mouth once twitches on the verge of a smile, and I have seen creepier children in kindergarten. I feel sorry for a good team to have wasted resources on a project that was doomed to fail before it even started.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So before seeing this remake, I saw the original The Omen. And out of all the seventies horror films out there, the original Omen was the only one to actually creep me out. Not even The Exorcist spooked me. And I had high hopes for the remake because all of my friends said that it would be oh so good, but they were oh so wrong!Most remakes incorporate different elements from the original into the film; the 2006 The Omen was basically exactly like the original except with different actors. I personally thought this role for Julia Stiles was completely out of character for her. Going from teen flicks like Save the Last Dance to a remake of The Omen is a pretty big jump. Examples as to how the original was better: Mrs. Baylock was creepier looking and swore to "protect thee", adding to the ominous Satanic nanny aspect. The whole death being apparent in the picture thing was more blatantly obvious in the newer one, and the subtlety in the picture made it more out of the ordinary. The suicidal nanny didn't crash through a window like in the original, and breaking a window just made it more interesting. Katherine Thorne's death looked equally fake in both films. Damien actually having lines in the remake took away from his creepiness. And, of course, the microphones bouncing in and out of various frames in the film took away from the potential horrificness of the movie.Don't waste your twelve dollars, just rent the original for about $3. You will get way more for your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was hoping for good things with the remake of The Omen. I was hoping for an extension of the Omen story with some new fangled effects.What we ended up with was a condensed remake, doing nothing more than re-running the exact same story. Though the difference is they have removed most of the character building, and just added a montage of the best bits from the original. While the sets and photography are fantastic, the acting seemed quite dull from most actors. The highlight would have to be Mia Farrow who plays the evil Nanny, and evil she is.Overall this was nothing more than a lacklustre rehash of a classic movie. Do yourself a favour and hire out the remastered original from your local video store.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally! A FUN horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen/2006/***Main Stars: Liev Schreiber Julia Stiles Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick David Thewlis Mia FarrowJohn Moore's The Omen is not like the typical horror film. The typical horror film has no wit and a bunch of scary images and BUM's from the music when someone/thing jumps out of nowhere to scare you or kill you or do something stupid. And most of the TYPICAL horror flicks will have a considerable amount of special effects just to make the fans of them be impressed. It is not impressive; it's old! It's stupid and boring! But this film has more to it than special effects and BUM's and people or things jumping out of nowhere? Okay so it has all of those things but it has a GOOD STORY to go along with all the extra goodies inside. So it fits together to make a good film! Most of the killings are cleverly planned out; however they are rather gruesome so I wouldn't recommend the film for anyone under thirteen. The film is rated R but I wouldn't agree. The film should have been rated PG-13 because there was only one killing that may have been really disturbing: a beheading in a different way that usual beheadings are. I would have to admit, it was clever and gruesome all the same. The story is a famous one. It's obviously about a kid that is the devil's child even though some inept people in the movie think he's innocent even though it was proved about a million times that he was the Antichrist. Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber), the father of Damien (Seamus Davey Fitzpatrick), is made the Ambassador of Great Britain after the one prior him dies from a clever killing. This is obviously the devil's plan to make him ambassador. So they move to a ridiculously enormous home where Robert Thorn complains to his wife, Katherine Thorn (Julia Stiles) that the house is a bit too big but soon accustoms to it. Katherine obviously does not know the secret of her REAL child and that he's dead which is what leads to Robert getting the Antichrist as a child. It is all planned out cleverly by the devil. Then things start to get out of hand. When the nanny gets out of control in her own mind and does the devil's bidding and hangs herself after repeating in a sweet manner, "Damien, it's all for you" things start to get suspicious. Then the photographer (David Thewlis) comes along and points out suspicious symbols that resemble spears in certain photographs. Robert is not convinced that Damien is EVIL! yet. He meets up with an elderly man (Michael Gambon) that gives him a pack of knives that he should kill Damien with. He needs to put the knives in a certain order for not only to kill Damien himself but his soul. But Robert STILL needs more proof but how much more proof do you need. And after another clever and the most gruesome killing, finally he's convinced. And the NEW nanny (Mia Farrow) who replaces that old nanny who hung herself resembles a person with a sweet disposition when first shown but if you get on her bad side or mess with her in any way to get her to go ballistic, believe me, she gets ugly and it's awesome (my opinion) what happens to her later in the film because she really deserves it! The movie was fun. The music and the very nice cinematography on a few scenes made it even more worth while so I would have to recommend it to anyone that can stand gruesome killings and still have fun with the movie. I will not recommend this film to someone who is a bit squeamish to gruesome killings and pays their attention only to the killings they just saw and keeps envisioning it over and over again in their head and doesn't pay the slightest bit of attention to the movie itself which I think is fun. So make your decision. Movie directed by John Moore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this expecting another average 21st century rehash of an older film. It delivered.While the acting and the effects were fine, this film relied way too much on today's horror film standby gimmicks. How many more films will be saturated with loud, jolting sounds coupled with things jumping out at you? This is the cheapest way to scare people. If moviegoers like it, that's fine. But it's still cheap.Without going into detail, the bathroom mirror "shock" in this film is at least 20 years old. The film is adequately entertaining, but far from genuinely scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to understand why Hollywood insists on re-making the old classics. Apart from the obvious, we gladly hand over our money in the vague hope of reliving a classic movie for the first time. Sadly this movie disappoints.Don't get me wrong, i wasn't expecting the new classic 'thriller' movie of our time. I was expecting an update, a fresh look at a great story.I didn't find the actors particularly engaging. I found the reproduced scenes consistently failed to impress compared to the original. I found the few diversions from the original didn't add anything but rather detracted from the classic.With the price of a movie ticket so high, keep your money or buy the original on DVD. The original is by far the superior film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this remake given the quality of the cast but this is a disappointment. I don't have a problems with remakes of classic films per se (The remake of The Thomas Crown Affair was better than the original, which was pretty good in its own right, and director John Moore's remake of The Flight of the Phoenix was as equally enjoyable as its 1965 predecessor). The good news with the remake of The Omen is the story is the same as the 1976 version. But the bad news is that the story is the same as the 1976 version. So while it remains faithful to the original, if you've seen the 1976 version, you don't need to see this one. And I would recommend the 1976 version over this remake in almost every respect.Whilst this version bears a script by David Seltzer (who wrote the previous version), the story seems much less persuasive this time round. Whilst the story is far-fetched, the 1976 version made it seem believable whilst this version seems to almost highlight the plot's flaws and lack of believability. Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles are okay but the usually reliable Michael Gambon and Pete Postlethwaite chew the scenery. Mia Farrow, however, is a great replacement for Billie Whitelaw and both she and David Thewlis win any of the acting honours going (Thewlis' death scene is the one moment that is a big improvement over the previous version). And while the music score for the new version references a few moments from Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar-winning original score, it just simply isn't in the same league. The sadly-missed Jerry Goldsmith was always a class act even in some of his lesser scores: At the time he composed The Omen, however, he was at the top of his game and the score that resulted was one of his absolute best and one of the many reasons why the original was that so much more effective than its recent remake (The Ave Satanis theme in the original was particularly effective and added immeasurably to the mood that the original evoked that is sorely lacking from the new film). However, it is in the last scene that this new version really drops the ball. In the 1976 version, Gregory Peck's Thorn carries Damien into the church to kill him on the altar with the seven knives. Just as Thorn is about to use the first knife, Damien, who has barely spoken a word throughout the whole film, calls out to him, begging him to stop "No Daddy No". At the moment when it matters, this hitherto sullen (and silent) little boy who has been responsible for the deaths of all those who threatened to expose him, suddenly seems to be nothing more than a normal child begging his father not to hurt him. You can see Peck hesitate for a moment. Is his son really the spawn of evil that he has come to believe or has he been driven to the edge of insanity by the death of his wife? Then the police marksman tell him to put the knife down. He hesitates, then decides, raises his knife and the police marksman fires. In this new version, Damien talks all the way through the film so there is no surprise when he suddenly speaks at the end to beg for his life. As a result, the scene has been robbed of all its impact. Plus the boy playing Damien this time round (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) just doesn't seem as evil as Harvey Stephen's Damien from the 1976 version.Ultimately, despite the improved special effects, this was just not a remake that needed to be made. Better to remake a film that tanked the first time and put right those features of the old film that needed improvement. But who in Hollywood has the guts to do that? (apart from Steven Soderbergh and "Ocean's Eleven")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland remake offers some visual experimentation. (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a remake of the 1976 movie, "The Omen" is nearly as long and as boring, with the only creepy thing really being (as expected) the child who provides very little dialog and laughable pouting. The value of the film, itself, however, is within its visuals and narrative construction. With the kind of budget the first movie never really had, the filmmakers tried their hand with some very interesting and sometimes, innovative, scene construction that appeared to be almost carefully crafted upon foreign cinema and classic American cinema out of the 1930s and 1940s, mixed with some of the avant garde of fashion and art films of today. There is such a careful and esthetic quality that seems stupidly wasted in such a poor vehicle: an American remake of a b-grade horror film. This one, however, at least was a timely whereas the theme equates politics with Devil's wrath and destruction of Man, but couldn't this have been expressed in a horror film that was of a whole new undertaking?The idea of remaking The Omen in the first place seemed immediately ludicrous, but it is no surprise that Hollywood continues to fail to offer anything original anymore. The summer blockbusters (at least, in their budget, not always their earnings) are chock full of tired sequels and even more tired blatant remakes or simple derivatives of other films. What is more sad is, that despite the filmmakers playing with these visuals, these esthetics of scene construction and execution, they still continued to revert to the standardization of the surreal dream experiences and quick "Boo" moments which really are unnecessary, except as a last ditch effort to acquiesce to the expectations of at least the easily-scared horror fans who give a scream when it happens (we had one of those in the theater). It is just a shame that, to at least present something with such a pleasing visual quality, it had to be done through something as utterly needless as a remake of The Omen.</fullReview>

Think my favorite scene and most sinister was at the funeral when Damien had his back towards the audience, then turned and smiled. Sent chills down my spine. The beginning of the movie with the Priest seeing the comet and the presentation made to the Pope with current events as point makers, really set the tone for the evilness of the movie. Has anyone heard if they are making plans to re-release the other movies? I have seen all of the originals, and agree with the posts that say this was extremely well made. I hope that if they do go forward with the remakes that the producers/directors will hold on to some of the character of the older versions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly i would like to state that i have never seen the original Omen, and therefore my comments on the remake should be taken with a pinch of salt! I sat down in the theater with a basic understanding of the general premise of the story: Young child is possessed by the devil and slowly kills all those around him through spooky and imaginative ways! If you are a fan of what i call a BOO movie, which is comprised of several moments that make you jump out of your skin, then you will not be disappointed in this film.David Thewlis is exceptional as the inquisitive reporter and Schreiber is careful to put his own twist on the troubled father. Julia Stiles does a solid job as a tormented mother. I genuinely believed she feared for her life in Damien's presence.A word to the wise. Be sure never to allow your kid to have a vicious dog for a pet!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very faithful reenactment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nowadays remakes run rampant, quietly stealing their way towards the big screen, to the point they have become a sub-genre of its own: one that spawns movies across most styles, from sugary romances to crude horror flicks. In this latter category seems to be especially partial to the remake tendency: perhaps fear is a timeless phenomenon and, as such, ever capable of reinventing itself according to the specific demands of the age. Whether remakes are a redundant exercise or important re-interpretations of great classics is yet to be decided and may be a question that cannot be settled unilaterally but be a matter of individual worth. The Omen (2006) is as faithful as a remake could ever hope to be. It is true that it is not a frame-by-frame carbon copy, but it retains the same narrative structure, virtually unscathed and delivers an imagetic scheme that is highly reminiscent of the original. Anyone familiar with the first Omen will be immediately reminded of some of the most impacting scenes, that have been translated to this new effort with little or not alternation in terms of form. What does change is the approach. This production is glossy and clearly stylish, the setting is explored through a multi-layered offer of different angles. Closeups introduce occasional detailed renderings of the characters, a bit like short lived character studies. In a pleasant surprise, the Omen does almost away with the nagging habit of extreme editing that seems to cripple so many contemporary fiction. ***Spoiler***It is particularly praise-worthy the scene in which a nurse, surrounded in light, holds the baby Damien, while his father-to-be looks at him from the shadows behind a glass wall. It was almost choreographed to capture and retain the viewer's attention. ***Spoiler***In terms of acting, it was competent and sober. Characters' profiles deviate slightly from the original, enough to allow us to glimpse the actor behind. This is notorious in the case of Damien himself: in this movie he is much more distant than in the former effort, to the point he seems to border on autism.The movie does manage to create a certain brooding atmosphere that lurks just beyond what is seen, this owing some to the dream sequences that far from original are still interesting enough. But overall, it is the contrast of dark, moody settings interspersed with cold and aesthetic shots that creates the tension necessary to unroll the scrolls of a horror story. Like the first, The Omen (2006) is more interested in suspense that in supernatural manifestations. Yet the death scenes that were the hallmark of the great original have not omitted, in fact they remain very similar: only updated to fit the 21st century. Which might have done more harm than good, these shocking events are too much like what one expect from the semi-serious Final Destination series to reap any admiration.But overall, there is a feeling of lingering disquiet, of general awkwardness, something too vague to be properly defined. A movie like this cannot help but be compared, its existence seems to demand such a comparison, to be almost part of its deeper meaning. The 2006 production does not top the original, in fact, one wonders if it ever tried to. While the credibility of remakes is at stake and still an issue of much debate, this particular movie seems to be a work of emulation. Clearly, the director admired and studied the Omen universe, adapting it to his personal view, while quoting many of the elements that make this one of the greatest horror movies ever done. It's more a work of skillful invocation than original creation. For those familiar with the first movie, this newer version might create a feeling of watered down intentions, an all too clear token of all that cannot be recreated. Yet it may also remind the same viewers of how much actually can be recaptured and delivered, according to a spirit of admiration nothing short of reverence.Perhaps not an icon for times to be, The Omen (2006) is a reminder that horror can still exist on its own, without falling prey to the ever growing trends of shallow minded productions that, unfortunately, abound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie puzzles me a bit. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Omen", in its first "incarnation" (1976 or so) has been a great noise for the entire world of cinema. With "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Exorcist" has been the ideal "trinity" of pure evil oriented movies. As every other great movie, it had its sequel, each as worst as the other (seen "The Omen 4"? No? Lucky Guys!!). Now we've got this remake. Clearly, it should add something of its own, just like a cover of a good rock band. Well, this is actually "The Omen" in the 21st century(sort of 2010/2011, if I made my homework). As the beginning of the movie would explain, the 11st September, the atmospheric anomalies, the sea quake in Indonesia, the tragedies of the war, seem to announce the incarnation of the devil, for all of these events fit the description found in the Book of Revelation. The chosen one is the Assistant of the American Ambassador in Italy, and his nice wife. When they'll have their baby (well, not exactly THEIR, but that's the point of the movie), their lives will change . . . totally. The cast is just great. Liev Schreiber just works out greatly his mission to play a "man on the edge" for the entire movie (and that's definitely something!), and also Julia Stiles portrays very well a wife whose life is falling down . . . literally. Mia Farrow has been just creepy. She does her "dirty job" with the sweetest smile on her face, and makes you wonder "why in the hell she hasn't an Academy Award Nomination?". I mean, watch the movie, and make an idea of what she does. Secondary Roles for David Thewlis and Micheal Gambon (directly from Harry Potter 5 set), and I have to say that their job on this movie has been really credible. Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick is the real thing. Cold, towel-like white, has less lines to say than Schwarzenegger in the first Terminator, but he plays with his ocean deep blue eyes. His gaze of corruption (used to suggest people to do thing they wouldn't)is just astounding. The music, by Marco Beltrami, works perfectly. I mean, it's really magniloquent and deep. Scenography: Summa cum Laude!! Nothing else to say. But . . . The Directing Work has some highs and lows that I didn't like. Some moments are really made to let you jump from the chair, but there is, in the central part of the movie, this huge interlude that isn't the most exciting/horrifying/entertaining thing I've seen in years. This hole of 40 minutes makes me give a 7 rather than 8. And there's this huge mistake. In Vatican City, priests are talking about the Revelation. In Italian, that book is known as John's Apocalypse ("Apocalisse di Giovanni"), so, there's this cultural misunderstanding. After all, a good movie. As every other remake, it isn't critical for your DVD collection, but it's worth a watch or two</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>its OK if...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually the movie is not that bad (esp. if you haven't seen the original 'Omen'). A young couple with hope for the future, a tragedy that happens to their son, the boy adopted as their own child that turns out to be Devil's son etc. We all know this story. So the main intrigue of the film was in the atmosphere, in subtle details, suspense... The first thing that draws your attention is the absence of that magnificent music (chorals in Latin) that makes the picture more Gothic. The new music was OK, but... On the whole the new Omen is more 'picturesque' (cannot find the word) (remember the episode with the reporter when he falls on the stairs without his head). The sp.effects are really good. The kid was OK too (he actually has nothing to play, i believe he didn't know he was Devil's son) BTW u no they had the kid from the original Omen there as one of the reporters probably used him as some kind of a talisman. Well on the whole it's good if u didn't see the original as i said. And the problem is not in the movie, it's about the atmosphere of the first Omen. It just cannot be reproduced! U c The Omen 666 had to be more modern 4 us to believe, it has smth from modern thrillers but the original movie was shot at older times and that makes it much better, over time it was mytholized (if such a word exists). Yeah, its just about the time: 1970s were great for such movies (The Exorcist for ex) and if we shoot the movie at this time it just has to be different. P.S. Sorry if i had any mistakes i'm Russian</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple spine chiller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of the people here compared this movie to the original(which I haven't seen), but I feel this movie should be looked at individually. The movie has met my expectations except for the climax. If you need a movie that don't have all the heavy special effects and still scares you off your seat , this one is for you. The audience jumps off their seats at least 4 times in the movie.The Director has done his job really well by creating the cold spine chilling environment throughout the movie.If you really are a Non-Special effects horror movie lover, go watch it in the theater and you'll not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great re-make!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a fan of re-makes as a whole, but I was really happy about this one. As I've said before, I am a horror movie buff, and so, of course, the first Omen is one of my favorites. I loved Liev Shreiber as Robert Thorn, and the little kid was even creepier than the first. Now don't shoot me down over that one too much, the first Nanny was definitely much scarier. Mia Farrow just did not cut it as an evil henchman for the devil. And Julia Styles as the mom? Could have done better with a more angelic newcomer. What I did like about the movie was that it didn't ruin the first one. It built on it, and maybe even explained a few things better. Most importantly, though, it remembers that movies are the scariest when there is a build-up of suspense, not body parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An average, badly miscast remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that if I were a director I would hate to remake a movie, especially one that is as well known as The Omen. I wanted to give this movie a chance, it seemed that this time, there was some actual talent involved in a remake. I have to say that the original is a movie that has always scared me. I first saw it as a kid and I saw it on DVD just a couple of days ago, and it always manages to creep me out. The original was done really well, it was more creepy than scary, but it stays with you after you watch it. And what can I say about the music, no other film score that I have heard can compare to this one for sheer terror. I can't listen to Jerry Goldsmith's score, especially the piece "Ave Satani" without getting the chills! It made the film.Now to the new one. It suffers from what any remake suffers from, a constant comparison to the original by the viewer. The movie uses the original screenplay by David Seltzer, with only a few tweaks, it is almost a shot by shot remake. The script was so good, that I can see why they wanted to use it again. The biggest problem here is the casting. It is all wrong. When I saw the trailer months ago I suspected that Liev Schreiber and Julia Styles were miscast, and I feel I was right. They are competent actors, but THEY ARE TOO YOUNG!!!! Especially Schreiber, he is too young and dull to come close to the elegance and pathos that Gregory Peck brought to the role of Robert Thorne. Styles just seems to be going through the motions here. The nanny Mrs. Baylock is played by Mia Farrow, she is fine, but is not nearly as creepy as the original lady that played her Billie Whitelaw. I could go on, the only role that stands out is Father Brennan played by Pete Postlethwaite.But the absolute biggest casting mistake is Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick as Damien. In the original, the kid played Damien was very creepy, even though he was shown really as a normal kid, unaware of who he was. His look was creepy, his stare was creepy. The new Damien, is not scary or creepy, he appears more in the film and as one of the tweaks in the script has more lines. He seems to be aware of who he is, and that takes away from the films effectiveness. He really comes off as annoying. Saying that there are some things in the film that work to make it at least an average viewing. This film has some pretty effective "jump out at you scares", and the action sequences, especially at the end of the film are done well. This film will definitely be better to someone who hasn't seen the 1976 version. The story is still good, so it is never boring. As a whole, I can only say that it is an average film. It proves that the right casting and a good director is as important as a script, Richard Donner made a great horror classic with the same script, John Moore is no Richard Donner, and it shows.I can definitely say that I enjoyed it more than Da Vinci Code.Grade: C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inconsistencies in the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>before of anything, sorry for my bad English. I'm learning and practicing.In this movie as in the original, there are some inconsistencies:1.- If Brenan's destiny is become dead (we know that for the photographs of the photographer), why the devil don't kill he before he advice to Robert Thorn and talk about Buguenhagen? 2.- Why a professional photographer take a self photograph? A professional photographer shouldn't have that mistake. 3.- If the church door is blocked for Father Brenan, Why the door is opened for Robert Thorn when he go to kill his son? 4.- Why the Devil don't kill Father Spileto, Bugenhaguen and all of the people who knows how vanquish his son?I think that the original movie was written thinking in a sequel and this is the reason of the inconsistencies. If child die in the first movie, they can't do a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uninspired, Unnecessary, and Completely Forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You'd have to be living under a rock for the past three years to figure out that Hollywood is running out of ideas for movies, horror films in particular. And typically, these remakes fail to emerge as quality films or bring anything new to the table. The Omen is no exception to this rule, with its dreadful script, disappointing cast, and uninspired direction. and the way it sticks so close the original Omen film that it is a near shot-by-shot remake.Liev Schreiber practically sleep-walks through the whole movie and has some sort of perpetually confused expression on his face. Terrible casting choice. And the little boy who plays Damien just looks evil. Clearly, subtlety went went out the window when they casted this kid. He just looks too evil and creepy, not surprising the audience one bit when they realize that he actually is, well, evil. In my opinion, they should have got a kid who had a bit more range of emotion and maybe one who was actually kinda cute. The cast does have one saving grace, though. Mia Farrow is extremely creepy and fun to watch as the nanny. It's a blast to see her in all her psychotic glory, and it's probably when the movie reaches its peak.And I just couldn't stand the script. I for one thought it was really unclassy when they kind of exploited images from 9-11 and the tsunami to tie in to the apocalyptic theme. I also literally scoffed in the theater at some of the dialog. It was all pretty bad stuff, even for a remake. "Drink his blood!", indeed.The way that John Moore directed this film was pretty bland. Yes, it occasionally had some great atmosphere, but I could pretty much point out when a jump scene would occur. And his attempt at some sort of "stylish" visuals fall flat, with the whole sharp red color in every scene. It's been done before in the Sixth Sense, and it was done with subtlety and ingenuity.As I see it, The Omen all comes down to this: some Hollywood execs were looking for a quick buck, but didn't feeling like writing anything new. So, they used a classic film, used no class in adapting it to fit with current catastrophes, hired a dull yes-man director, and decided that it would be cool to release a movie on 6-6-06. The end result is a forgettable and uninteresting mess saved only by Mia Farrow and a good decapitation scene. I wouldn't even watch this on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very bland, nothing special and unique</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen (2006) is a classic example of what can go wrong with remakes in spite of all possible efforts in the right directions. Any movie has to be judged based on its basic elements such as the cast, acting, screenplay, musical score, cinematography and editing. For those who have seen the original, it's common knowledge that the horror effect was heightened by the musical score and the incredible lighting and color effects in every scene.Let me start with the many bad aspects of the movie and later move on to the few positive aspects.While making this remake, the director definitely updated various aspects of the story but, a good movie is not made by use of the latest technology alone. The cast consisted of promising actors for a change but not the ones that can deal with random emotions with ease. The only right thing about the casting was Mia Farrow. She was the saving grace of the movie and was the perfect choice to play Damien's nanny. The musical score of the original movie was very haunting and it would have been a better idea for the remake to have retained the same score. The score for the remake lacked any sort of eeriness, coolness and spookiness of the original and would be defined as bland if it were a meal.I must admit though that the remake had its moments. I guess a little something had to work for the remake for trying way too hard. While creating this movie, the director made it a point to retain couple of sequences scene by scene which in a way did good for him. A certain cemetery sequence and the couple of scenes preceding it were the highlights of this movie. On the whole, this remake didn't completely fall flat like many recent remakes but at the same time couldn't stay true to the original and in any way match its standards.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OMEN- left me a bit... disappointed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I was prejudiced to be disappointed by this movie because I'd seen the original as a child. I was excited to see the new version especially because it was rumored to be very true to the first. On that regard I must admit it has scenes which are faithful to the original... but there was something missing.It seemed this movie was more of a rushed attempt to retell the first script. There were new actors, new special effects- all without the absolutely terrifying build of horror that made the original so successful. I just didn't get the same thrill. Actually, I wasn't thrilled at all, and petulantly sad that my favorite character (Thewlis) was killed off, though I expected it. This isn't to say that the movie isn't worth a viewing, but if one is more interested in suspense, do yourself a favor and rent the 1976 Omen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty much the same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a well made film with one or two "jump out of your seat" scenes. It is a remake, however, and you can't help but compare with the original. It's pretty much a scene for scene remake; the death of the nanny, Damien knocking his mother over the balcony and the killing of the priest are virtually identical. It's a lot gorier, however, and the decapitation scene is the one bit that is superior to the original.The lead roles are well acted, although a contrived scene had to be put into place to explain the youthful ambassador. Presumably by doing this the makers were trying to attract a younger audience.My biggest gripe is the score. Jerry Goldsmith's music helped give the original its atmosphere. Sadly, the music to this one is just plain ordinary.If you haven't seen the original, you will enjoy this film. If you have then you will probably still like this version but will want to rewatch the original just to confirm that it is the better film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was it just for 6/6/06?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On going to see the release of the new Omen I knew that it would not compare close to the original as many others would. If you have seen the original and are a fan then this is basically just the same film with more jump out your seat moments some slightly changed death scenes and different actors for the modern generation.When watching the film I could tell each line that was about to come but maybe in all the films main goal was just to release the omen one the 6/6/06. The shots of the twin towers collapsing, the tsunami wave did however give the film a more realistic approach of the birth of the Antichrist; and there were a few more "scares" placed in dealing with the breakdown of Julia Stiles' character (Katherine Thorne).As far as the acting goes there isn't any exceptional performances from the cast compared to the original. Julia Stiles doesn't deliver any great performance as well as Liev Schreiber's. But I do have to hand some credit to Mia Farrow's performance as Mrs. Baylock the replacement nanny also an apostle of hell, despite the critics remarks; sure it was not as good in comparison to Billie Whitelaw's in the original but still added to the mood of the film to make it seem more chilling with her crazed rage into protecting Damien. Also Jerry Goldsmith's score in the original which won the film Oscar for best original music score gave the film it's Gothic and suspenseful mood.The death scenes them selves were not less thrilling as the originals but no more either. You have to praise the original for it's time 1976 where as today in film they can do almost anything. They all imitate those of the original but don't have that "wow" affect that was gained from the original. The decapitation scene differed slightly but wasn't anything great as it is common these days where as back in 1976 it was one of the very first. A let down to the film was the remake of the famous tricycle scene of the original, even today with the modern technology it wasn't half as good as that of the originally you don't actually see her fall over where as you get a glimpse originally and as she falls the effect isn't of any brilliance of the original's. The angle shots as well which add effect to the 1976 were almost imitated in the new release.Overall though the film really is just another horror remake to attract the modern audience of cinema and to over exaggerate the release date 6/6/06; in which felt as if the film was rushed to meet this deadline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would be fantastic except it's a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there was ever an example of cinema as product then this is it. I doubt this film would have ever been made except to cash in on the date 06/06/06. When I first heard about this effort, I had some slight hope that a whole new story would be constructed around the basic premise of the original (like what happened with the remake of 'Planet of the Apes' a few years back). Not a chance. Instead, this is basically a reshoot of the 1976 horror epic that starred Gregory Peck and Lee Remick as an affluent couple who unknowingly adopt the son of the Devil. This time around it's Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles who are the unfortunate parents of demonic brat Damien.There are some new elements added to the plot: the boy Damien seems to be playing an active part in the mayhem that is unleashed on his behalf (a fact that adds a chill to the final scene), there is a prologue in the Vatican observatory indicating that the Catholic hierarchy are aware of the coming of the AntiChrist (a genuinely thought-provoking and eerie scene to be fair), and some wicked dream sequences get thrown into the mix for good measure.Otherwise, screenwriter David Seltzer pretty much regurgitates the script he wrote for the original film (I wonder what he got paid for this, talk about money for nothing!). This destroys much of the suspense and foreboding that a story like this really needs. SPOILER: Anyone who's seen the 1976 version will find themselves experiencing a severe case of deja vu- the entire plot unfolds in exactly the same way and big chunks of dialogue appear to have been unaltered also.However there are some positive points, the soundtrack is very effective and underlines the gloomy, doom-laden atmosphere that prevails. There are about five or six really top-notch shock moments scattered throughout the movie. In addition, the film is visually stunning with striking photography, outstanding production design, and gorgeous and effectively used locations. I loved the film's use of vivid color to set the emotional tone. I was engrossed by this movie even though I was irritated at how predictable it was.The cast really make their best effort with the material they've been given. Pete Postelthwaite and David Thewlis are scene stealers, and Mia Farrow is wonderful as Damien's Nanny- imagine a Satanic Mary Poppins and you're kind of on the right track. Both Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles offer effective portrayals of Damien's ever-more beleaguered parents, and Schrieber does a good job of making his character's motivations more ambiguous than Gregory Peck's were in the original. The viewer is left wondering whether he takes action against Damien to save humanity from the AntiChrist, or merely to save his own skin. The death scenes are luridly well-executed, and the Rottweillers from Hell are amazing.If I had never seen the original, I would probably say that this was one of the best horror movies that I have seen in years. Instead it's like hearing a cover version of a favorite song- there's no freshness but it's reassuringly familiar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, but the original is better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to the movies to see this film, i had already watched the original of 1976 and thought it was going to be good but not as scary as the old one. I got more than I expected but still not as good or scary as the original.First the pros: the scenes at the beginning of the twin towers and the Asia tsunami and all the wars going on were great, perfect for the horror part of the film. another good thing is that they used technology perfectly well for the film specially in the decapitation part (which in the old film is practically funny) and in the part where Mrs thorn falls from the balcony. they included the dreams of Mrs thorn which are the most frightening parts of the film in jump-up kind of way. Finally the outstanding performances by Julia Stiles(which i did not expect so much from) and Liev Schreiber. Julia Stiles blew me away as Damien's tormented and anxious mother. I really felt sorry for her.Liev Schreiber does an excellent job as Damien's confused father and does the last scene in the church exceptionally well. Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick gives an outstanding performance as Damien Thorn, he does just as scary and intimidating as Harvey Stephens from the original. Also liked David Thewlis as Jennings and Micheal Gambon as Bugenhagen. I'm glad Harvey Stephens came back from the original even if it is just for a minor part.The cons: I expected Mia farrow to be the best one in the film as Mrs. Baylock, however I was really disappointed, she didn't do a horrible job, and if I hadn't seen the original I probably would have liked her, but after seeing Billie Whitelaw as Mrs. Baylock in the original, which frightened me so much I couldn't sleep the night I saw it, Mia Farrow was a big let-down. The music was really good, but jerry goldsmith music is way better than in this new version, especially in the last part when Mr. Thorn gets chased by the dog and traps in the basement room; in the original this part was mysterious with whispers saying "anticristo" as the background chorus and you don't what to expect, in the new one however, this scene happens way too fast and is not frightening at all.In conclusion this is a good film, well made and with great performances, but it is not as frightening as the old one even if the old one didn't have all this technology, it is definitely scarier and for this I give more credit to the original version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Omen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Armageddon lore through Christian mythology is alive and well. Robert Thorn a prominent U.S. ambassador to Great Britain becomes the step father to the son of the devil through a crazy mix-up at the hospital. Fun times follow when the Thorn family moves to London including a nanny's suicide, monkey's rampaging at the zoo, and the mother falling over a banister in their own home. The son of the devil gives new meaning to the phrase problem child.The Omen becomes a prime example of how suspense is dead. It has been replaced by flashy jump cuts and intense sound design. Triggering the epileptics in audiences appears to be the films goal with random montages, reminiscent of any Michael Bay movie. The audience might walk out of The Omen frightened but not of the end of the world but of loud noises such as car horns or slamming doors.Though The Omen is not as scary as it could be it is certainly one of the more worthy remakes to come out of Hollywood. Liev Schreiber does well as the conflicted father of the devil and gives an enjoyable performance. All in all if you haven't seen the original and feel like a night out at the theaters see The Omen.www.salutetocinema.com</fullReview>

But if details are what you want, details are what you'll get.Scrieber and Stiles are terrible. They lack charisma and chemistry and are not only totally unbelievable as a young married couple, but as characters. There's no character development, no background, no context, no depth. Just two bland cardboard cutouts speaking their lines. Stiles goes one step further to deliver a performance that is outright bad. Several lines were delivered so unconvincingly that the audience, myself included, laughed out loud.Davey-Fitzpatrick is fine as Damien, but the kid never smiles; never speaks. Is it normal for the 6-year old children of American Ambassadors to live their lives in frowning silence? Such a child would be in therapy long before he displayed any overt signs of being the spawn of Satan.The look of the movie is just so lazy and generic. Even a scene that involves digging up a corpse by moonlight in an abandoned, fog enshrouded cemetery has all the suspense of watching paint dry - a spectacular feat of non-direction if ever there was one.The entire movie, though having the glossy and superficial sheen of quality that a large budget lends a production, fails on almost every level. It's not a spectacular failure. You don't walk out shaking your head in disbelief that it ever got a theatrical release. But you do wonder how so many people, earning such large salaries, can happily produce a movie so bland.Not a terrible film...just, well, DULL.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've never heard of the film or not seen the original then this will be an enjoyable horror film, different to most horrors. If you have seen the Original and Liked it then you will most likely enjoy your time spent watching this film as it stays very true to the original and in some cases the cinematography and mise-en-scene are identical. The film is a basic carbon copy of the original but obviously updating a classic to appeal to a new generation of movie goers, it even includes references to certain modern day disasters such as 9/11 and the 2004 Tsunami to show the coming of Armageddom brought upon us as part of the cycle ending in Damiens birth onto this earth.I felt the biggest floor in the film was the casting.I felt the child cast as Damien, a very simple role reliant on looks more than anything, didn't look menacing enough and at times i felt he'd be better in a Home Alone style of film. Mia Farrow was excellent as the Nanny as i felt she had quite an artificial, sickly and sometimes sadistic manor and suited the role perfectly. But thats my opinion. Stiles and Schraeber do competent jobs as the parents but I don't feel either stole the show or acted superbly.Visually i loved this film, and a few sequences in particular were very very well done. As for the scares, there aren't many at all, and a few could be seen coming a mile away (dream sequence/mirror open then shuts to see apparition in rear,etc..) I did jump physically in one sequence where i wasn't expecting it (which i won't mention specifically so it may surprise you too). There is a distinct feel of Final Destination to certain moments in this movie as you will see, but the average gore fan out there shouldn't be disappointed with the moments of blood here.So, it was an entertaining 2 hours. Nothing terribly new, and not as creepy or Gothic as the first one. In a way, i was hoping it might go in a different direction, but perhaps, it's the producers' ultimate compliment to the original - keep it very similar,just updating it for a new generation of horror fans. Recommended but don't expect fireworks.</fullReview>

Lackluster performances we've seen in other similar movies, along with bad casting of Damian's mother-- way too young, even with a nod from Mia Farrow...who had the best scene in the movie when she got in front of Thorne's Lexus. Maybe if I had never seen the original, which had it's weaknesses, too, this might have been entertaining.

		<shortDescription>better that I expected, but still a pointless remake (plot details mentioned)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Hollywood obsession with remaking horror movies from the past continues with The Omen. Coming to cinemas after the releases this year of The Fog (awful) and When A Stranger Calls (even worse), I wasn't expecting much. Also, Hollywood has a very poor record recently of making good and scary horror movies. So with low expectations I went to see this........and in truth it's not bad. But it's not good either. The plus signs, are that the plot is the same with no new twists or spins on it that I can remember. The death scenes are very well done, especially the decapitation scene. While watching it, I kept thinking about the deaths in the Final Destination series, as they were done in similar ways (although I did wonder if the makers of the Final Destination movies, stole the 'accidental' death idea from the deaths in the original Omen trilogy). The actors are pretty good too.However...The original did not need to be remade. I also feel that if you are remaking, re-imagining, or updating, or whatever you call it, you need to do something to engage modern viewers. The Dawn Of The Dead update showed you can take the same plot and change it enough to be different, while retaining the key elements of the original. For The Omen remake, as I understand it, they simply took the original screenplay and pretty much stuck with it, without changes. If you are going to do that, then what's the point of remaking it? I want to see that script, I'll watch the original thank you.The actors, as I said are good, but the cast simply can't compete with the original actors. Gregory Peck v Liev Schrieber? Lee Remick v Julia Stiles? David Warner v David Thewlis? No contest. And then there was the child playing Damien... The scowl on his face all movie just made him look like a spool brat, not the anti-Christ! The child in the original was much better.A couple of bizarre, and frankly pointless dream sequences didn't really add anything either, so I'm not sure why they were there.The original Omen is a good horror movie (not a classic in my view). This remake will probably make more money, possibly mean the sequel Damien: Omen II will be remade soon, but it won't linger in the minds of horror fans like the original does.Despite all this however, I feel as a Friday night movie, it works. Just don't expect to spend Saturday and onwards thinking about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not up to par with the original..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I went into this with much too high expectations. Even though this added some nice touches to the original, it just cannot compare with it. The acting wasn't great, it was OK. The score wasn't that good, like every other modern horror movie score, loud noise. This movie relied much more on special effects than the original did and this movie just wasn't that scary.I don't think I need to go into any plot detail. Robert Thorn (Liev Schrieber) has found out his newborn son is dead. He can't tell his wife Kate (Julia Stiles) because she would be devastated. By chance, they can adopt a another newborn whose mother died, they name him Damien....There were a couple of things that I liked a lot about this movie. The start, where the modern disasters were compared to The Book of Revelation, was quite effective and a good opening scene. The dream sequences were also quite good and added another nice touch. The last thing is that the look of the movie was outstanding. The use of colours and lighting were used to great effect.I'm not going to go on for ages complaining. I'll list a few things I disliked. The casting was OK, the leads actually do the best in the movie. Mia Farrow as the nanny was not a good choice and the little kid they chose for Damien was not creepy at all. The score is nothing to the originals. It's pretty much just loud music. The last thing I will comment on is the change of the deaths. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, they just weren't as terrifying as they were in the original.2?/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was hoping for a good update of a decent classic horror film. Instead I got a pointless remake ala Gus Vanzant's "Psycho" (1998). I longed for the fast forward button so that I could skip the expository dialogue scenes in which I already knew what was to be said because I had seen the 1976 version. The only interesting thing was to see how famous scenes would be updated. The zoo scene with the monkeys was actually less effective than in the original. The original's claustrophobic effect of being in a car surrounded by raging animals is lost perhaps for the better because it would now seem like a retread of "Jurassic Park" (1993). There are a few more inserted shots of frighteningly made up people, similar to what was introduced by "The Exorcist" (1973) and perfected by Japanese horror films, but these inserts do not add a whole lot. The death "accidents" have been updated with more post processing flash and explosions, but it seems to take away from their power. Overall nothing is added (the internet is now used a little) and I see no real reason for remaking a 30 year old film in this way. If you have seen the original, you may as well re-watch it or wait for this film to come to DVD. If you have never seen the original, you may still find this enjoyable, but you may be better off renting the DVD of the 1976 version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not you're average horror guy. Actually, I rarely watch horror movies. But my friend invited me to see it so i accepted, looked cool on commercials. The movie was INSANE!(For me) It scared the crap out of me, after the first jump I could barely watch without my hair covering my face and making my vision blurry and looking at the seat in front of me. It's hard to avoid them to because they literally SCREAM at you. But it was fun and I talked and laughed about it afterwards. I HAVE NOT seen the first one, but my friend told me it was very similar to the original. The way deaths are predicted is trippy (watch it to find out) and the few deaths disappointed me. Personally, I want them to remake the other three. If not I'll just watch the old ones, which is weird coming from me.Well over all, the movie was pretty good. I really did enjoy it(and i usually crap myself when I watch horror movies). This movie makes me want too watch more horror movies. I didn't watch these kinds of movies because I hated to be scared, but now it's fun.SPOILER WARNING: After the wife dies the dad has one dream. I didn't get the bald devil guy behind the bars in his dream, 'twas weird. Maybe you guys can help me out on that one. Also, I didn't get why they needed like, what... five holy knife things?

		<fullReview>I was really open to this film. Read all the bad reviews but was willing to enjoy it for what it was, unfortunately what it is - is a badly structured film that was rushed by the director. Although I understand that he had an 8 month deadline to get the film out by 6/6/06 and it shows! I'm not sure how much of the original script was changed. I saw the original in 1976 and haven't seen it since but remember it being a lot tighter.I think the blame lies with the director. A screenwriter's adage is: come in to a scene late - leave early. A number of scenes came in at the end and left in the middle of the next scene. Scene set ups were predictable and plot points were badly structured - this may have been a time constriction rather than just plain laziness.Too much suspension of belief, a US Ambassador walking about London, and elsewhere, without any armed guard or FBI/CIA.I saw this film as I'm in the process of co-writing my first horror film. I watched for inspiration - it has only inspired me to do better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie expecting an Exorcism-like scare, yet came out laughing and wishing I had my $6.00 back. They were going for the right look with Damien, yet his character was ruined when he had no more than 5 lines. I did not mind Liev Schreiber, yet Julia Stiles' acting made me want to puke. She did a horrible performance and this was not the part for her. The only scary parts were the horror stereotypical loud-noise-make-you-jump scenes. I expected a genuinely creepy, scary movie and came out completely unfulfilled. It deserves the 5.8 rating it got, if that. If I were you, contemplating on whether to see it or not, be wise and use that money to see X-Men 3 again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was watchable and surprisingly good.- I liked the fiendish atmospherics and foreboding, this was portrayed by some (cheap) BOO scares... and even visuals that are not for the faint-of heart.- Beltrami's score is excellent. I really like the way he composes ominous melodies that suggest a frantic temperament, the presence of evil, or outright urgency for suspense.- Shcrieber was intense in his role as an unbelieving yet scrupled man... you will see his character arc back and forth as he wishes the demon child dead... and when he is told to do so, hesitates. And in a very graphic scene, takes all back assumes responsibility at which point there is a thrilling final scene where the audience ain the cinema applauded and cheered for Schrieber.- Mia Farrow and Julia Stiles were also very good players.What's interesting is that the screen play was written by the same scribe as the 76 original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Omen has a very fond spot in my memory from childhood. I remember seeing the poster at the video store and the simple chilling power it had over me as I was asked by my folks to hurry up and select a film. I think it was the crow on the poster that did it. Followed by the tormented faces of Gregory Peck and Lee Remick leering back at me. It reminded me so much of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds (we'll to an eight year old it did) and that thought terrified me. It also excited me.I was not allowed to choose The Omen according to the video clerk (due to it in its day being quite controversial and the South African censors so narrow minded that they slapped it with an age restriction of no persons under 21). How was a eight year old going to get to see this obviously very scary movie that had adults only written all over it? Well thank goodness I never had narrow minded parents (that only happened later on when Basic Instinct finally arrived, also set at 21 age restriction, and not being able to watch it because it had orgasms in it( I was 15 then)). Parents are funny things! Well anyway (back to childhood), a few weeks later Dad had brought it home and I was allowed to watch if I promised not to take it all seriously (I know this is asking a lot from such a young child most psychologists would say) but I loved them more for it. They trusted me that I was old enough and big enough to handle what was only a film and we discussed it religiously afterwards to debunk any fears I may have formed regarding the film and our faith (we are devoted Christians). It struck chords of delightful terror in me and when I think back I smile with pure cinematic joy at the three of us huddled together being scared out of our wits.So of course I was one of the first to rush out to see the remake. I wanted to relive that moment so many years before, so I tried to drag Mom and Dad with me to see it. They had since moved on (horror no longer did it for them but Mrs. Henderson Presents...yes dear any day) so I took a friend who'd never seen the original. The premise of the rise of the anti-Christ from the vocal point of his childhood did nothing for my friend who pushed it aside as pure Hollywood sensationalism (due to it being released on 06.06.2006). For me, it was like being transported back fifteen or so years. As I watched the film certain scenes from the remake sparked of synapses in memory of the original an all I could do was smile. But time has moved on and at age 28 the original storyline no longer has the power or grip it once held over me in childhood. I actually found myself chuckling at some of the absurdities that had clearly passed me bye originally. That is not to say I did not enjoy it. As far as remakes go this was a commendable job and as far as memory serves me, very faithful to its source (the one death scene involving the beheading of one of the characters has changed dramatically). Perhaps horror no longer has its sway on my imagination like it once did but if for only a few hours, this new remake did allow me to relive a part of childhood I cherish.6/10 Rated no persons under 16 for Violence in South Africa</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good remake but where's the point in remaking it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, this is one of the better remakes. It's quite entertaining and creepy, has a great cast and one of the most eye popping beheadings I have ever seen. Beside that, where's the point in remaking a classic like Richard Donner's 1976 version. Apart from the visual effects, there is nothing the remake can improve on. Instead of this, you realize what an important part of the first one Jerry Goldsmith's music plays in setting up mood and suspense. Marco Beltrami's score may be good for those who don't know the original, but it is nowhere near the impact of the first. The cast ranges from effective to good and Mia Farrow is great in the Billie Whitelaw role of Mrs. Baylock. Production values are good and the camera-work is fine (Only one of those dumb jittery hand-held sequences which I hate from the bottom of my heart!) and overall it's a great looking film. All in all, there's nothing to be ashamed of but there is also nothing to congratulate to. Maybe Hollywood should better concentrate on remaking bad or mediocre originals like Amityville Horror, The hills have eyes or Texas Chainsaw Massacre instead of films that still deliver the goods, even after 30 years. Or what about some original ideas....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The child was scary, but Mia Farrow was not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake of this David Seltzer classic was good at times, and irritating in others. The acting was fair, but Julia Stiles was too young to be convincing as Katherine Thorn. Liev Schreiber does a decent Gregory Peck imitation, but Mia Farrow as the evil Mrs Blaylock- truly a mismatch. Her acting was terrible, her makeup overdone and the scene in the hospital room was totally amateurish. The boy was convincing, as was the dog, although the Scooby Doo like trapping of the dog was also ridiculous. The dream sequences added nothing except shock value, and the travel scenes were misleading- when drinking the coffee while going to the cemetery it was snowing, yet no cold air came from the actors mouths, but in Jerusalem, with the heat and muggy temperatures there was breath coming from them. ??? Also, please, when editing a film, make sure all boom mikes are removed from the final cut, as there were more than 1 scenes where you could see the boom. All in all, not a great remake, but it did make me want to re watch the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all must have suffered, at least once, in our lives, this I call peaks and troughs, will The Omen (2006) suffer at the hands of its Cinema elite or will it be forgiven? For me, The Omen has well and truly been forgiven, forgiven for its sin of being reborn in the hands of Director John Moore, of Behind Enemy Lines (2001) and Flight of the Phoenix (2004) fame. He has nurtured his newly adopted child and given us a holy new movie that can stand on his own two feet, with a very reassuring British cast driving this movie forward with dexterity and personality, such as David Thewlis, Pete Postlethwaite and Michael Gambon. These greats have over shadowed the mildly amusing and wooden American cast, Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles, which have fallen to their knees, who can only deliver, at best, a rather flat and lacklustre performance. With the exception of Ms Mia Farrow, in comparison to the two lead roles, the only high-octane US' counterpart who has excelled herself as the nanny from hell, literally.The Omen, the peaks here, is a very good movie, with its own surprises and individuality to boot. But as with the troughs, we have a very one-dimensional lead role and his non-existent wife, these being the weakest link and with some of the dullest character development since Bill Pullman and his Presidential days in Independence Day (1996), truly dire and lifeless. With this calibre of English actors, why have the American market let this movie down? Is there not a single actor and actress of this calibre that, ironically, Hollywood can claim to have brought forward? No doubt Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles were not the first choice?The cinematography, done by Jonathan Sela, has delivered us from a seemingly slow start, to a pace that has all the trademarks of a very dark and frightening world that is the fight between good and evil, with its forbidden pastures, and the consequence of trespass that this revelation brings. The Omen will have us believe that the Worlds past, and future, disasters are not merely man made, but driven by a Higher force, such an easy excuse to even blame both Good and Evil. With this predicament in mind, The Omen delivers itself, kicking and screaming, into a New World of impending doom and chaos, with the pace slowly building up to a fine mixture of paranoia, death and bleak fatefulness.Yes, this was a great little movie, a modern day horror with Historical overtones. I really did enjoy it, with its moments of fright, shock and mild horror, with a little bit of Soul searching; this latest edition to the Omen family should thrill and entertain.</fullReview>

The new scenes added are important enough to make the new OMEN timely to be seen today due to all that's been happening in our world today.The Bottomline i think religious thrillers such as Da Vinci Code are now the trend films of the year. With all the horror, gore and ghouls that's been on the big screen lately it's smart to release this good remake of the film. The difference of the two films is that the old one relies the terror with Jerry Golsmith's score and the pace of the story these two elements are the factors while the remake relies on the fast pace of the plot and it's shocksI still like the old Omen but this is a worthy remake for the new generations of fans.</fullReview>

The blame for the problems of the film should be aimed at the director.The introduction is has the film linked to the present day in an interesting fashion, but any good originality ends there. However in addition, the director has forcefully added some cheap scares done with sudden sounds/images, which do not really fit to the mood of the film. The original movie's more subtle portrayal worked better compared to the more straight forward remake.Overall I think the original mastered suspension and story telling better, leaving me ask what was the point of the remake?</fullReview>

The movie was okay in that it provided the suspense needed to carry you through the film dying (no pun intended) to find out what is happening next. There are some dragging moments where you snap back to reality and get antsy but towards the end you get so caught up in the drama I was practically screaming "KILL EM!" Now I am a big Julia Stiles fan, and I though I was not overly fascinated with her performance, the one scene with her and the nanny in the hospital I wanted to jump into the screen and save her. I really felt for her character and I think that's what made it work for me. I felt for the characters I had to, and hated the ones that deserved it. Now I've never seen the original, but I enjoyed this movie enough to write a review about it and that is saying something. Overall, I give it a 7 out of 10, just because I didn't like the ending though I knew going in that's how it was gonna end up...hell, I'm an optimist, give me popcorn and a happy ending and I'm pleased. p.s.

It was only when Thorn and Jennings collaborated to begin investigating that the film came into its own. From this point on, I thought it was great, possible better, more gripping even, than the original. Good performances from Schrieber, Thewlis and Pete Postlethwaite (as usual) were the standouts.

Sorry, but this remake is not as good as the original! I prefer watching the Original version than this remake! I personally like watching Horror films,but this thing simply can't be called a Horror film ! I've seen so nice and worthy Horrors and this is simply nothing compared to them !!! So if you want to watch a really interesting and worthy Horror film , then go to the nearest video rental store and rent yourself "The Omen" - 1976 version. You will be left pleasantly surprised by this piece of classic in the horror genre!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's the point of a remake if it's MUCH WORSE than the original, and there's NOTHING new added to the movie? I don't automatically slate every remake, just because it's a remake. For example, when "Lotita" was remade, I thought it was much better than the original -- a lot was added to it, the remake had more 'substance', the actors were much better, the soundtrack was improved significantly, etc....but this? If it ain't broke, why fix it? Seriously, the original is a lot scarier, more believable, and MUCH better cast. It's a classic, and should've been left alone. If you wanted to remake it, should've done so with an agenda to improve it, not ruin it! There's actually nothing to improve anyway, so they should've just left it alone. Period.This remake is boring, forgettable, and quite badly acted. The original was very atmospheric and creepy, but this is just ridiculous.No one can compare to Lee Remick, that's obvious, and even though Julia Stiles is an O.K. actress, she is TOTALLY unsuitable for this particular role (not to mention too young). Her performance is pathetically weak compared to that of Lee Remick in the original. Liev Schreiber, however, is half-decent.The little boy, who plays Damien, is also horribly miscast. And Mia Farrow as Mrs. Baylock? Are you kidding me? Mrs. Baylock is supposed to be the scariest character in the movie, but in this remake... they have got to be taking the p***.Was the whole purpose of this remake, so they could play around with numbers (06.06.2006)?? I'm pretty sure this was the case, because I see no other reason why anyone would waste time making this piece of junk.It was totally uncalled for.I don't know how this movie was perceived by those, who never saw the original; but those, who have, were definitely not impressed, I'm sure.The original still creeps me out (and I've seen it countless times).

		<shortDescription>I might be biased, but this remake is so much better than the original that it simply saved the Omen experience for me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a person born in 1985, I find it very difficult to enjoy most films from the 70's and 80's (besides Disney's animated features). Yet, as a devout Horror fan, I realize that many of the classics are from that time, and have taken it upon myself to familiarize myself with at least some of them. I'd like to open this review with a special thanks to director John Moore, who has salvaged The Omen experience for me. It might be my fault for not liking 70's acting and cinematography, but I simply didn't like the way the original 1976 film was made. This 2006 remake has taken the fine (if slightly too religious, and affiliated with Christianity in specific rather than religion in general) story and script and has fixed anything and everything that needed fixing!The acting was so much better than in the original. Having great actors like Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles (both whom I happen to like from their prior films) was just a bonus I guess, as acting better than the original cast would be easy for you and me as well. The face expressions, the "struggle" scenes, the dialogues, everything was so much more realistic and believable. Even more importantly - little Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick was a far better Damien. With barely having 3 lines in the entire film, his penetrating blue eyes, his mature and almost old expression and his body language were all just perfect for the part. He wasn't scary or creepy, he was dark and gloomy.The screenplay and script were hardly touched, though some of the scenes were altered a little (and each time for the better!), and some of the shots became a lot clearer making it easier to understand the events. So anyone who isn't much of 70's cinema fan could watch this one instead of the original, though I'd still recommend watching all Omen films by chronological order.All in all - I can't emphasize enough how much this production shined compared to the original. The Omen of 2006 is a fine film, but compared to The Omen of 1976 it's simply fantastic. Very happy I decided to watch it despite not enjoying the original! Rated 6 as a film and 9 in comparison with the original, final average rating 7. The Omen has been redeemed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-Done And Creepy Remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people probably wouldn't give this film a try just because it's a remake of a film that people think couldn't be remade. Well, they're wrong. This is a very fitting and well-done remake with quite a few creepy moments that just made me shudder. It's about a couples child who turns out to be the son of the devil and utterly creepy and eerie things start happening that make them realize the truth. The acting is pretty well done, and the creepiness is pretty high, too! The story is very good, and also pretty complicated, too. All in all, this movie is pretty good and should be given a try! Rated R for Violence, Gore and Language.Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this yesterday with my wife after I was tired of watching my movies. I forgot we even had this one. So we threw it in and we both enjoyed it. I slightly remember the first Omen...only the one fact I knew there was a part two so I had an idea how it was going to end and they did a great job with that.I thought some parts were over acted and the kid did a "so,so" job with the very few lines he had. I like how the slight events ended with an amazing deaths of several characters.I hope they make a part two and continue on the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>as a fan of the original, i was very skeptical at first about this movie, this is actually one of the few movies that i actually got off of my ass and went to the theaters to see with my wife and oldest step-son. to my surprise, i was pleasantly surprised. i did like the fact that the film opened with scenes from the Vatican, that was neat, and the dogs in the movie were cujoesque to say the least, liev schrieber i thought did fairly well in his performance, julia styles did a good job,, and mia farrow was just down right creepy. this one goes more into the history of the beginnings of damien, but not quite as good as the original, but it did modernize the story very well i thought. overall i would watch this again,, and one day i will watch the original one on TV screen with the remake next to it and make a comparison between the two,, that should lead to a very interesting re-review,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly unnecessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should have seen it coming. I have tried to stay away from this kind of remakes of 1970's horror. I guess the problem was that "Dawn of the Dead" was so good that it lowered my guard. But now the guard is up again firmer than ever.I'm no fan of the original Omen-movie. Granted it was a bit original (i guess, i didn't see it until decades after it's release) and the actors were not bad. But the whole premise of Satan fighting the forces of good have never held any real appeal to me. I guess that's the result of an upbringing more or less completely devoid of religion.Anyway, while the original movie at least held some qualities, this piece of garbage doesn't. Don't get me wrong, Liev Schreiber is a pretty decent actor and so is Julia Stiles. And the movie in itself is not all crap when it comes to pure film-making craftsmanship. The problem, the one and only huge problem, is that this is a scene-by-scene remake (or reiteration might be more suitable) of the original movie. There is nothing new here, not one piece of originality in the whole production. And that, of course, sucks. I can't stress enough how much i hate movies that lack all kinds of originality. It is as if the film-makers have just abandoned all pretensions at originality and forward-thinking at the door. This movie lacks ambition so much that it's awful.And above all, this movie is completely and utterly unnecessary. This is crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually don't watch scary movies with the intention of getting scared. Frankly scary movies just don't scare me. When I walked into the theater with my mom I figured I was going to sit through a film, roll my eyes, and sigh a couple times. Nope not the case. From the opening scene I had my head in my hoodie. The little boy who plays Damien is pretty convincing with those eyes. Certain scenes I remember to this day being very graphic and having a lasting impact on me. I would definitely recommend this movie if you are tired of scary movies that just don't scare you. I wasn't able to sleep for a week. I would stay on the phone all hours of the night just to make sure I didn't die throughout the night. I've only seen it once but I will definitely see it again in the near future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost exactly the same movie as the original, but not as good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was there anyone that was actually surprised when it was announced that there would be an Omen remake released on 6/6/06? Perhaps the greatest ploy of all time, The Omen remake could not have been released at a better time. Not only did it have the 6/6/06 release date to its advantage, but in a time when 70s classics are being remade into gorefests (Hills Have Eyes, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Black Christmas), it was time for a remake that relied on more than shock value. Under normal circumstances, I'd whine about how The Omen being remade is pointless, how it's all about money, etc. though ultimately when the film it theaters, I was tired of every R-rated horror flick being about blood and sadism than genuine scares. To my surprise, I enjoyed this remake, even more so the second time around. It's almost scene for scene the same picture as the original, only not as good. Although director John Moore is no Richard Donner, he still impresses with plenty of slick shots, effective shaky cam moments, and when he wants, a style other than Donner's. If only he went with his own style more, this remake could have been a classic in its own right. As it stands, it's a well done horror remake, and one of the best horror pictures of 2006. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now this is what you call a horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are interested in movies about possessed children, devilish nightmares, unfortunate parents and demonic numbers then The Omen will appeal to you.The Omen is a remake of the 1976 horror movie about Satan's son who was switched at birth and placed in the care of two unfortunate guardians. Damien was born on June 06 at 6am, 666 being the sign of the devil.Damien has evil powers, which he uses to create havoc and death amongst the people around him. It is up to his adoptive father to try and prevent the prophecy of 06/06/06 from happening.The Omen is certainly a frightening film. I have not seen a film that kept me on the edge of my seat and biting my nails in a long time. Just the evil look on Damien's face is enough to frighten anyone. I have not seen the original film but this is a film that deserves a lot of credit.The release date which was 06/06/06 was filled with a few coincidences for example my ticket was booked on 06/06/06 at 16.16 as well as the South Africa currency, the rand was R6.66 to the American dollar at 6.06am. No devil seemed to come to our humble abode on 06/06/06 but this great movie did and you should go and see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The end of the world...Once again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without having seen the original version of "The Omen", I can probably assure two things: it was a good idea to do it again and the time (some months ago, the 6/6/6) of release was commercially perfect, kind of like the last film you would see before you died.The hands of director John Moore, who has done forgettable films ("Behind Enemy Lines"), take on another remake (he directed the new version of "The Flight of the Phoenix") and this time, on one that will be remembered. A movie like "The Omen", with all its plot lines and sceneries around the world, is perfect to exploit cinematographic resources, and Moore does such thing.The talented and every-genre writer David Seltzer also puts his hands in the screenplay, in the task not of rewriting it, but of updating it. This update is very well achieved and it can be seen clearly during the first scenes, while the Church goes through a series of events that are leading to the end of the world. Moore and Seltzer become a very effective team when it comes to surprise the viewer."The Omen" is one of those horror films like "The Others" where you know when something horrible is gonna come, but it still makes you jump of your seat; and the explanation for that is the work of a good director. And it's not only Moore and Seltzer around the world. It's Marco Beltrami's experience in the genre, and the ability of capturing the moments with his score; it's Dan Zimmerman's first and well accomplished editing work.But there are other things that cause more impression to us in pictures where the son of the Devil will destroy us all. I'm betting my money on the theory that the casting directors called 20 or more kids per day for an audition and told each and every one of them: "Please put the meanest and weirdest looking face you can get". Luckily, a Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick was the contest winner and got the role of Damien. However, his work is remarkable in all aspects; and makes him an interesting target to watch among the child actors.The choice for the main couple was odd; two incredible actors that seem to fit anywhere but here. Anyway, they are working and they end up doing their jobs. Live Schreiber is always competent but I'm not a big fan, except for his performance in "Jakob The Liar", when I was about becoming one. I also heard he is a fine director.About Julia Stiles; this is not her best performance and she could have chosen something else to return, but is just good to have her back. Consequently, the ones who steal the show are the supporting actors with their intriguing roles: Mia Farrow is scary as a peculiar Nanny; the ever (I've said it) Pete Postlethwaite as a man full of predictions; and the best role in the film, David Thewlis' very good and 'more superior than others in the genre' portrayal as a nosy journalist who reminds me a lot of how Alan Rickman plays characters.The new "Omen" is worth it completely, and so is everything that comes with it. But the message in the end, as a friend of mine said; what is it? "The Devil is among us"? You figure it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>www.kajatm.com The Omen Surprise, Surprise no new ideas out of Hollywood. In the last recycled storyline out of Hollywood, The Omen is a remake of the 1976 classic horror flick based on Damien whom is the Son of Satan. Even though it is a remake and to my disappointment because I was really looking forward to blasting this movie The Omen was actually pretty good.The only characters that everyone will recognize in this film are Julia Stiles, Pete Postlethwaite aka Koybyashi (The Usual Suspects) and Liev Schreiber (The Manchurian Candidate). I would mention the child actor that played Damien but I believe he had about 2 lines of dialog in the entire movie.The film begins with the audience discovering that all the signs that the Son of Satan is coming to earth are being tracked by the Catholic Church and such events as 9/11 and all the fighting in the world shows that the time of Satan's son return is upon us. What I really want to know is if there is a Catholic division that tracks all of the priests that are molesting little boys? Sure the return of Satan is a big deal, but molesting little kids is no little item but that is neither here nor there.Next we discover that up and coming political leader Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber) and his wife Kate Thorn (Julia Stiles) are expecting the birth of their first child. However, the child "supposedly" dies in child birth which could be potentially crushing for both parents. But just like Monte Hall, a priest shows up and wants to make a deal. Lucky for both Kate and Robert the priest has an extra baby just waiting for them however he forgets to disclose that this baby is the Son of Satan and one would think that this would be a detail that you might want to mention.After this we go into Robert's and Kate's life over the next couple of years in a made for the movies slide show. This takes us to present time and how the baby they have adopted is truly evil and how they are going to handle this situation. From here we have a lot of killing, traveling to find out about Damien, killing, more plotting to kill, planning and eventually the open door ending.The only thing that really disappointed me about this movie was the sound track. Unlike the original there wasn't the chanting music in the background. This was highly disappointing because that music is about the only thing that stands out in my head about the original. How is a guy supposed to know that something bad is going to happen without the chanting music in the background? How I ask you, How! One thing that I think is worth mentioning is the release date of this movie. While a little bit corny you have to give it to 20th Century Fox for coming up with the brilliant marketing scheme to release this movie on 6/6/06. But this kind of marketing makes me wonder which came first, the idea of remaking the movie or the fact that some big wig at 20th Century Fox is patting himself (or herself) on the back for noticing that 6/6/06 was coming up and that it would be a good idea to make a movie that would take full advantage of that day.I really did like this movie. There are a lot of good jump out of your seat moments and overall the storyline flows together very well. The kid that they picked to play Damien did an excellent job of looking creepy throughout the entire film however his acting ability is still unknown as his lines of dialog were limited. If you are a fan of horror movies or you are looking to scare your date into your arms I would recommend taking the time to go see this movie. But then again, what do I know?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen tells the story of a politician and his wife, who gives birth to a stillborn child. In an effort to cover it up, the politician unwittingly adopts the Antichrist and gives it to his wife to raise as their own. When their son turns 5, strange things begin to happen, and the politician teams up with a photographer to uncover the truth about his son. This remake is very faithful to the original, which makes it a better remake than most, but because it's the same, it lacks some of the creepiness.In a time when remaking 70's horror films seems like the cool thing to do, it was only a matter of time before someone decided to remake The Omen, and what better date to release it than 6/6/06? The Omen did what most horror remakes do not, and that's stick close to the original story and not go overboard trying to add new things. I can't really say anything in this movie is better than the original, because it's the same. The deaths are slightly more gory than the original, but they lose the shock factor they had before because you know they're coming. That's the biggest problem with this new remake. It stays so close to the original story that anyone who's seen the original knows everything that's going to happen. Even though the remake is a very well made film, it lacks the same eerie feeling.I really enjoyed the acting in this movie. They picked actors that could really do a 2006 mirror image of the 1976 characters. I didn't really think Julia Stiles was that amazing, but Liev Shreiber as Robert Thorne was very good, and I'm sorry to say I enjoyed his performance more than Gregory Peck. Pete Postlethwaite was very good as the scared Father Brennan. The portrayal closest to the original was David Thewlis as the photographer, who did just as well in the role as David Warner 30 years earlier.Overall, I liked this movie just as much as the original, except it lacked some of the same creepiness and (forgive the term) oomph! of the original.7/10</fullReview>

I really enjoyed that film! But in the case someone went to see a horror film, then there would be a problem and the only solution is renting the old DVD. The actors were all terrible with the only exception of Mia Farrow. And I am sure the producers spent most of the time searching for the kid. It's a miracle they found some kid playing that bad. In the first movie, Harvey Stephens (Damien) made you chill. In that one, kid looked like suffering from constipation. Maybe that sounds bad for a little boy but i don't see why any little boy must play in movies. Since none spent time or money trying to make something new out of the old script, couldn't they spend some time trying to make a film?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, The Omen (the original with Gregory Peck, Lee Remick) is one of my all time favs. Great acting. Great soundtrack. Great concept. This one, the remake, will now be one of my all time disappointments. Who cast this film? A freshman NYU film student could have done better. Lets start at the top of the food chain. Casting Julia Stiles as Mrs. Thorne (Lee Remicks role in the original) and Mia Farrow in the role of the Nanny is like casting Benji to play the Hound of Baskerville. Just does not fit. If you are expecting to see great acting, rent the original and skip this one. Who did the score for this film? Over the top, not memorable and cliché dramatic and just plain flat. The original, by Jerry Goldsmith, had soul, meaning and depth. This soundtrack lacks all three. No soul, no meaning and no depth at all. If you are expecting to hear a great soundtrack, rent the original and skip this one.Well i could go on but i won't. My suggestion is to just rent or buy the original Omen, invite your girlfriend or boyfriend over, make some nice hot tomato soup and enjoy a quality film that set a mark for horror films in its day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant in Spite of Itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has plot holes you could drive a truck through, and the downer ending was not necessary, but there are several brilliant moments throughout and Liev Schreiber's performance is fantastic.The audience laughed at all of the Julia Stiles character's dream sequences. Halfway through the film I was unimpressed. Damien was just spazzing out occasionally and a lot of it was just lame. But the scene where the Priest tries to run to the church, only to have its doors shut was my first sign that there was some brilliance in it. This is a film whose second half is much better than the first. Unfortunately, that's where the plot holes start.Why doesn't the man at Mediggo just kill Damien himself? Why does Robert speed and get cops following him instead of going slowly? Why must he recite "The Lord's Prayer?" Why not just kill the bastard? At the beginning, Father Spiletto seems to be responsible for the situation. Why does he then inform Robert where to find the jackal's remains? Maybe I need to see it again, but after one viewing these plot holes were vexing to say the least.I saw this shortly after seeing Silent Hill (spoilers for that one follow as well!), going with the same person both times. The movies are similar in that both are generally epic battles between good and evil. Both my friend and I agreed that Silent Hill was the better film, partly because in Silent Hill good triumphs. My audience (a 10:40 screening) was very rowdy and we were all rooting for Damien to die. When he doesn't, it's a let down. It would have been the movie's logical ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the things I remember most from the original is the music. It was way better than most of the acting, story, and overall movie. This time the music is truly outstanding; however, there are other elements that complement the effective use of sound and visuals by the director. The performances are much better, from the diabolical turn by a very manic Mia Farrow, as the nanny from hell, Julia Stiles as the distressed mother, and Liev Schrieber as the torn father. Yet the best performance is by the find of the century, a child actor whose gaze will chill a few bones. He barely utters a dozen words throughout the whole film because he doesn't have to. He manages to convince us that he is a malevolent entity just by directing his intense blue eyes at us.Most people are familiar with the original, so there won't be many surprises along the way, but the execution of the remake has been fine tuned and will offer more than a few spooky jolts. The preview was cheesy, in comparison to the complete scenes. There are moments in this film when all falls in the hands of the director, and he has somehow given us a film that makes your skin crawl. There are intense moments when we can almost feel the impending threats and is unmistakable that our character might meet their doomed fates at any moment. The gore factor might have been increased a little bit, yet it is the execution and the development of suspense that makes this a thrilling film. The camera focuses on inanimate objects that seem to take on a life of their own. There is danger everywhere around us is what the message seems to be.Get ready to enjoy the dark ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As far as remakes go, it's not that bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had two reasons for seeing The Omen: 1) I love horror movies and 2) morbid curiosity. As a rule, I am staunchly against the idea of remakes but every so often, like every rule, there are exceptions. This is one of them.The acting ranges from barely mediocre to very decent. I'm not sure why but as a general I have a fondness for Liev Shreiber. He's honest, charming, confident, likable and he doesn't disappoint here. He portrays Robert Thorn with such quiet intensity that if anyone could replace the immortal Gregory Peck, it's him.Let me be blunt: Julia Stiles is miscast as Katherine Thorn and I knew it from the second I first saw her in the trailer. Her character is supposed to be in her mid-forties and not so much a young trophy wife. The part is altered to fit Stiles' age but somehow, it still doesn't work. Her and Robert are now about ten years apart and there's no real chemistry between them, no spark. All that aside, Stiles can't be blamed for these issues. She plays the hand she's been dealt and does well with what she's been given. She goes from cheerful and proud new mother, to suspicious, to downright bitchy, to frightened and pulls it all off believably. Furthermore, it was rather refreshing to see her tackle a role that's remarkably different than what she's played in the past.Mia Farrow is a fabulous Mrs. Baylock, hitting the opposite end of the spectrum of the role (the "desperate housewife" Rosemary) that launched her into fame. Her role is all about irony what with her kind, assuring face, silky, soothing voice and a sort of elderly innocence that all hide something much more sinister.David Thewlis is pitch perfect as the ambitious photographer. His performance is not particularly award worthy but everything about it is spot on and believable.Unfortunately, Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick is not very good as Damien and the film suffers because of it. This not so promising child actor tries much too hard to appear menacing and demonic. Not once does he smile in the film (except in the last shot) and all he does is scowl and glower. It was much more frightening in the original when Harvey Stephens portrayed Damien as a fairly normal child: cheerful, playful, carefree, innocent. Here, we are bludgeoned with the fact that this child is evil and I grew weary of it. After a while, I didn't even buy Davey-Fitzpatrick as the anti-Christ but just as a snotty little brat that was in desperate need of a slap.John Moore's direction is slick and competent; he is able to effectively establish the mood and general feeling of tension and dread. At times, however, he resorts to hitting the audience with cheap shot jump scenes accompanied by jolts in music and amplified sound effects--predictable ones I might add. There were too many moments when I was thinking, "Uh oh, it's really quiet right now, something's going to pop out. Yup, there it is." I rolled my eyes, but the kids in my audience bought into it. What I find scary is when I am expecting something to jump out when the scene dead silent and there's a lot of build but it never amounts to anything. Moore never does that here.Technically speaking, everything seems to be top-notch: editing, sound, sets, costumes, and especially the camera-work which I found was done particularly well. It's frenzied and claustrophobic when it needs to be as well as slow-moving and deliberate when it needs to be. The musical score is not as nerve-jangling as Jerry Goldsmith's overbearing compositions (and "Ave Satani" is notably absent throughout the film but makes an audible appearance in the closing credits) but is still effective, creepy and sometimes understated enough to compliment what we see on the screen.Screenwriter David Seltzer (who also wrote the original 1976 screenplay) updates the story into modern times and certain world events of the past few years have been incorporated into the plot as prophecies told in the Book of Revelations appear to be coming true; it is rather unsettling, no matter what your religious views. This is a somewhat different take on a story that draws influence from its source. Characters, scenes, situations, and methods of demise (Lee Remick plummeting to her death was gruesome but watching a bubble of air slowly work its way through Julia Stiles' IV and into her bloodstream was enough to make me squirm) are altered so that the result is something other than a simply updated version of an older story (like Gus Van Sant's puzzling shot-for-shot remake of Psycho). This new version is able to exist as a fairly independent entity but still remains faithful and Seltzer treats his own material with respect.The film stuck with me for a bit afterward and I realized how much I actually liked it the more I brooded on it. I paid full price to see it (ten bucks) and I did feel like I got my money's worth. I even thought it was worth viewing a second time and that right there is a good sign. It is definitely not a half-assed remake; it looks as though a lot of serious work went into this picture in front of and behind the camera and the result is something worth a recommendation.While the film does get knocked down a few pegs just for being a remake, it also suffers from some preventable flaws. It is inevitably inferior to its thirty-year-old predecessor but it does not disappoint as much as I expected it to.I give The Omen a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Omen? Oh, man!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this flick. I went to see it last night (6/6/06... I'm a sucker for clever marketing) and while I will say that the film was not better than the original, it was still enjoyable and actually did some things better than its predecessor, even if it did get some things wrong in the process.I loved the way this film was shot, for one. It definitely helped the mood of the film, especially for the last half, when the two protagonists are looking for clues of Damien's origins. It's so dark and gloomy that you can practically feel the weight of doom as you watch it. The death scenes are pretty horrific and are basically the same deal as the original, maybe just a bit more gruesome this time around. David Thewlis's decapitation scene was really well done and is at least on par with David Warner's horrific death form the original. Speaking of Thewlis, I thought he was fun to watch. He almost has that David Warner charm. Mia Farrow was great as the nanny from hell. They made some interesting changes to the storyline like adding scenes of destruction from recent headlines, most notably the attack on the World Trade Center. The movie is almost exactly the same as the original, just a little more spiffed up. Oh and before I forget, I jumped twice while watching this. The original never actually did that for me.Problems I had with the film start with the casting. Julia Stiles was, in my opinion, way too young looking for the role. They needed someone with a little more age to play the part. That's not to say she was bad, she was just not convincing in the part. Liev Schreiber didn't bring me into the film the way Gregory Peck did and there were only few moments where he managed to shine. The kid who played Damien... he was good but I think one of the problems with the film is that from the start, this kid is an evil little bastard. Yeah, he's the Anti-Christ and all that jazz but part of what made the original so creepy was that the kid really had no idea who he was and was seemingly innocent and ambiguous. The Damien of the remake gives dirty looks to everyone, shows up in people's nightmares and participates even more in his mother's demise this time around. I don't know why but I just preferred it when the kid wasn't outright evil like this kid was. The music in this film is sadly, nonexistent. Considering that Jerry Goldsmith won an Oscar for the original's score, they should have given the score a little more heft. Last but not least, the ending, while just about the same as the original, was not done right. All I can say is that they edited the scene wrong. It's not like the original, where you don't know exactly what happened to Thorn and his son until the very last shot. A little weak, in my opinion.This was a decent remake and I liked the fact that they had respect for the original because it definitely shows. They stuck with what worked and tweaked some things here and there, even if they goofed with some considerably important elements. Worth a watch but it's nothing you have to run to the theater to see.RATING: *** out of *****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unwarranted and unnecessary updated version of a much loved classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't seen the original Omen film it is well worth checking out as a benchmark of horror excellence. Unfortunately, as with most modern remakes, they fail to live up to expectation or quality control and The Omen, although better than most, is still an unwarranted and unnecessary updated version of a much loved classic.In place of an atmospheric and chilling set-up, the remake relies on cheap horror tricks such as creepy dream sequences ending with a loud noise to make the audience jump which I find obtrusive and ill-fitting. The acting is also below par with Liev Schrieber cruising through the film unconvincing in his slow realisation that his son is devil incarnate and must be destroyed. Julia Stiles acting is also sub-standard and occasionally smirk-worthy especially in her confrontations with Damien but it is Damien himself that pulls in laughs when he should be portraying the exact opposite. When he glowers at those he is manipulating it looks more like a child who has just dropped his ice-cream and is silently demanding an immediate replacement before the crying and stamping of feet begins.So, what is meant to be a serious horror becomes farcical tirade and the film is essentially a shot for shot remake of the original without passion or tenacity begging the question of why bother remaking it? The answer is of course money. So save yourself the price of a cinema ticket and rent the original if you haven't seen it or go and see something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is THAT all about? No matter. I'll just heave my own two cents worth onto the pile, since I've already heaved my $6.50 into the coffers of the entertainment industry. Why the theater didn't charge $6.66 is beyond me, though.Sure, this remake of a decades-old film was "pointless." Sure, it doesn't sport the "star power" of a Gregory Peck or a Lee Remick. Sure, it hits almost (but not quite) all the same notes as the original.So what? Is it well done on a technical level? Yes. Are Schreiber and Stiles convincing as a young political couple thrust prematurely into the high-pressure lives of a U.S. Ambassador and his wife? Yes. Is the kid creepy? Yes. Are there enough differences and yet enough similarities to make it an interesting retelling of the story? Yes.Let us bear in mind that the same guy who wrote the original screenplay wrote this one, based on his own book. Don't blame the director for whatever it was you thought was different, or should have been. Blame David Seltzer, or perhaps the suits who greenlighted the project.Me, I had a fine time watching this film. I liked its being dragged into the new millennium (same as the old millennium). I liked the subtle alterations within a favorite story. I enjoyed listening to Schrieber occasionally channel Gregory Peck's voice. I liked the improved decapitation of the photographer (played well by David Thewlis), along with the nastier hanging of the nanny (an effective Amy Huck), and I especially liked the new death for Stiles' Katherine Thorn, although it makes no more sense than in the original that Mrs. Baylock gets away with it.It's not an overly memorable film, no more so than the original was. It's a product of a different time, a different sensibility, but still works as well as the original.This whole thing reminds me of the bleating nostalgics who slapped down this summer's other remake, "Poseidon," in favor of the cheesy Irwin Allen production from the early 70s. Please. I saw both, and with minor quibbles, the remake was easily superior to the original.Get a grip, you self-righteous romantics, you! Modern audiences have no chance to see the original in the theater. Most of them have the cultural attention span of a flea anyway, and don't even remember the original if they ever saw it. At least they know who Julia Stiles is, maybe, and Liev Schrieber, possibly.If nothing else, a few of the younger crowd will be motivated to see "Rosemary's Baby" because of Mia Farrow playing Mrs. Baylock.Now there's an old classic horror film I'd like to see remade! Hollywood, are you paying attention? Of course you are, you old whore, you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its worth your curiosity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, i just got back from the movies and i thought i'd comment on it while having it fresh in mind. All scenes -in order of appearance- and most dialogs are surprisingly the same with the original Omen but there are a few made-up parts as well that will scare the hell out of you.It's the whole scenery and atmosphere, colors and a few special effects that make the remake more enjoyable and exciting than the original one. As for the actors, Mia Farrow is great and you will surely be craving for more of her talented (secondary here, though) acting role. The protagonists have done their job quite well but its the lack of originality and mostly persuasiveness that make this one easily beatable when compared to Gregory Peck's role-playing. The first nanny appears to be quite funny here and not at all evil. Her figure and face don't match with the classic nanny's vicious characteristics and this is one thing that comes highly noticeable in a negative way. The dog they picked up for that scene is totally out of touch and too kind and cute for this role! On the whole, this remake is worth watching at cinema than renting the DVD(when it comes out) cause else you won't experience the 3 or 4 scares you'll surely get in there. However, i can assume that the fans of the original Omen will walk out of the room quite disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have just come back from seeing 'The Omen' on 06/06/06! Apart from the massive queues at the cinema, enjoyed the whole experience very much. I have not seen the original, so I am able to comment on this movie without any bias. The whole mood of the movie was excellent. I was particularly impressed by the cinematography. The main characters were great and believable. The chemistry between Liev Schreiber (as Robert Thorn) and David Thewlis (as Keith Jennings) was excellent. Pete Postlethwaite was great as usual. Was scared witless several times by the 'make you jump' moments, and came out the theatre feeling suitably freaked out and also quite moved. This is very much a thinking person's movie - amazing story and scary without being cheesy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So, so remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today. 6-6-06, I found myself sitting in a theater at lunchtime munching on a McDonald's Spicy Chicken sandwich (I sneaked it in) while watching this glossy remake of a rather boring devil/monster film from 1976. Why? I trusted Ebert and Roeper who both gave it thumbs up and there are such slim pickings these days.Hollywood loves Satan because he works without a union card and unlike God he intervenes in our daily lives, causing all kinds of exciting, photogenic mayhem. Here he is again, right out of Zoroaster circa 500 BCE (the dude first credited with inventing his unholy lowness in Persia, now, curiously, Iran).Within the laundry list of satanic killings we see some subtle witticism; like Kevin McCarthy who could still be seen running around the streets warning people in the 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers some 22 years later here we see, of all people, Mia Farrow some 38 years after she mothered a little baby devil in Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby (1968) playing the devil's nanny, still trying to protect the little devil-child. However, here she finally gets hers, but good, you betcha. What little suspension of disbelief that I could muster up was smashed to pieces in this screening as various types of boom microphones kept showing up at the top of the screen frame and I mean really showing up, big time. This happened in more than a dozen scenes, more than in any other film I've ever seen. I suppose the camera operator will say to the entire above the line staff that will have to cover the cost of optically (or digitally) reframing those scenes, "The devil made me do it."On the other hand the very last scene is a winner. We see that the little devil has been adopted by none other than the president of the United States. The scene is shot from behind the president and child. Camera goes close-up and the little devil turns around and smiles, an ever-so-familiar smile.At the bottom line, however, I can probably think of some 10,000 other, better places to enjoy my next McDonald's Spicy Chicken sandwich.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand why people compare this movie with the 1976 version. The present one is an excellent film and there is no reason why we should compare it with a movie that was made thirty years ago. Brilliant photography, visual effects, sound, coupled with first rate performance by all actors make The Omen (2006) a treat to watch.Before watching this movie, I read a number of reviews lamenting the present version for its supposedly weak overall filmography. I am really surprised. There isn't a dull moment throughout and the production is simply flawless.I am a horror/mystery fan and have watched a large number of movies including The Omen (1976) and I would highly recommend The Omen (2006) to those looking for suspense/mystery/horror.My vote: 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I'm not much of a fan of the original, which is slow and turgid and often teeters on the edge of boredom. There's not enough wrong with it for me to dislike it, but there's not enough good about it to make me like it either. It stands in no-man's land. The remake is much more fun, though it suffers from some of the same concerns, such as uneven pacing and a basic plot that just isn't that hot. How, you might rightly ask, does the remake manage to be much more entertaining than the original despite following it incredibly closely? Well... it's tough to say. The budget plays a big part in it, honestly. Watching people sit around, or wander around to different locales is a lot more appealing when you can make it look really good in the process. It's also helped, somewhat, by the performances. Mia Farrow is fun and over the top as the creepy nanny. The colder performance in the original was fine in and of itself, but this goofier turn adds a bit of life to the film. Furthermore, the central character of Robert Thorn is much better this time around. This isn't to say Schreiber gives a great performance; he's merely okay, a little dull, frankly. But his turn worked much better than Peck's original did, as Peck made Thorn into a pompous buffoon whom I actively disliked. (Peck also managed to overact without actually conveying any emotion. That's quite a feat.) I don't feel an overwhelming amount of sympathy for this Thorn, but not hating him does help the film, as he is the protagonist and all. (And, as the film goes along and things get worse and worse I did start to sympathize with him a bit.) Some Seamus kid plays Damien, and he's been much criticized, and not without some reason. One of the relative strengths of the original was that it didn't try and make Damien be all scary and evil, what with that being a pretty tall order for a little kid. Here Seamus mostly just glowers, umm, evilly, and he is something less than terrifying. It coulda been worse, though, and he doesn't get too much screen time. Julia Stiles takes over the role of Kate Thorn, and she has an extraordinarily round and squishy looking face. I didn't notice too much else about her. (I must say, however, that her performance was not conspicuously bad, as I anticipated it might be.) Also of note is Pete Postelthwaite as one of the various crazy priests, Father Brennan. It's the standard Postelthwaite role, twitchy and creepy and overdone, but I've always liked it before, and he continues to entertain me now. Lastly, though he doesn't do much, I couldn't help but mention the appearance of Italian horror veteran Giovanni Lombardo Radice as another priest. I hate to be the guy who gets interested when some smalltime actor from obscure, forgotten film randomly shows up in something big unexpectedly, but his appearance did amuse me. This time around Radice gets his face melted, though we don't actually see it happen on screen...Again, this is a big-budget affair, particularly for a horror film, coming in with a budget 30 times greater than that of the original. It's all up their on the screen, and the film looks great. Sorry folks, but the money does help a lot. Take, for example, the graveyard scene. The scene is pretty much the same in both versions in terms of content, but the new one is still multitudes better because it actually looks good, as they had the time and money to find an appropriately ominous setting. This could be said of most of the film, as a matter of fact. It's an odd combination really, the somewhat silly plot and often wacky performances combine with an ultra-sharp look, making this film classy and hokey at the same time. Also reducing the hokiness factor somewhat is the absence of the lame Gothic sounding music of the original. What they replaced it with is undistinguished, but at least it doesn't hurt the film.The various death scenes, like most of the rest of the film, are largely the same, aside from the sharper visual style. This isn't uniformly true however, as their is a bit of not so great CGI work, but there ain't much of it overall. Most notably, the decapitation scene has been reworked to some degree. Nowadays a decap isn't liable to impress anyone too much, but it is pretty well done, anyway. The impalation was the best death the first time around, I thought, and it's pretty cool here too. Probably the best one. It does have a bit of the aforementioned unfortunate CGI, but it makes up for it in other ways.All that said, I'm not really sure who the audience for this film is. Horror aficionados will, for the most part, dislike it for the modern aspects, and hate it for being a remake. And I dunno if it'll appeal to stupid teenagers too much either, probably finding it too slow (as I did, frankly) and moody. (It does make some concessions to the newer style of horror, but I don't think enough to win most of them over.) Nevertheless, I thought it was fun, if far from remarkable. So I guess you gotta be like me, having a taste for both modern and 70's style horror (the golden age of horror films, if ever there was one), and a sufficient affection for the genre to take the good aspects of the film while not being especially bothered by the bad parts. If you can do that, you'll probably have a good time.</fullReview>

It was a total let down, and everyone agreed with me. It had maybe two or three scenes that made me jump, but nothing else. It was slow and boring. There was a huge build up to the last scene, then.... total let down. I love horror films, but this was just sad.For example, the nanny fight. She was the one watching over Dameon. When the father tried to take the boy, it was the weakest fight I have ever seen. Before that scene in the old graveyard the music build up was bad to. They were simply driving and the music was pounding. I thought something big was going to happen. But then it just stopped and the characters we just standing around outside the car.In my personal opinion, this movie did not meet my expectations at all.

		<shortDescription>Entertaining remake with more scares than the first.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of remakes, especially horror films, but this definitely had its good moments, mainly due to a strong cast. Liev Schreiber steps in to Gregory Peck's shoes to play the role of Robert Thorn, unfortunate ambassador who finds out that his cute little 5 year old boy is actually the anti-Christ. Its never easy to take a role which has already won an actor critical acclaim, but I thought Schreiber did an admirable job. His disbelief, grief and, in the end, utter horror are credible. Support roles by David Thewlis, Pete Poslethwaite and Michael Gambon were just as convincing. The only person I thought didn't have the chance to do more with her role was Julia Stiles as Damien's mother as the script didn't afford her the time. In the original Lee Remick's slow descent into terror and fear of her son is more drawn out and integral to the plot. All thats left to say is keep tight hold of your popcorn, because there are far more jumps and gore than the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually dug this movie. I was worried walking into the theater because the original was SO GOOD. And then there was all the hype building up to it's release, it's hard to live up to that much hype... and then the obvious cash crop of the date for the release... I was expecting to walking into a total piece of crap, but I did it anyway because... well, I'm not gonna be alive the next 6/6/06. I was surprised by a couple things from the movie that helped me enjoy the movie and really get into it like the first time all over again. It stayed very true to the original, which was great, and how they set the movie up at the beginning drew me in. Of course, being a remake, it was incredibly predictable... but at this point, Hollywood very rarely delivers new scares anymore... and it was the exact same script writer (which was a smart move I think). The nanny is AWESOME. Seeing her for the first time and not realizing she was going to be in the movie, I had a sudden flash of Rosemary's Baby... great tie in. My personal opinion... go in with an open mind and expect it to parallel the original fairly close and you'll have a good time. I'll be getting it for my home collection.</fullReview>

I have seen the original and can comment that the remake is almost exactly identical in terms of story and characters. Which is not a bad thing. All the nasty death scenes are back and revamped with modern computer effects which makes them 10X more gruesome and satisfying. Also the music by Marco Beltrami is awesome, scary, and just sends chills up your spin. Sean Davey-Fitzpatrick was excellent is the child Satan. And all of the actors did decent job especially Liev Schreiber, Pete Postlethwaite, Julia Stiles,and very especially Mia Farrow who is super creepy is the nanny Mrs. Baylock.

		<fullReview>I'm trying to pinpoint which element is missing from this film and why it falls flat on almost every level. The sorriest part is that the cast, while exceptional actors in their own right are given a lumbering, dull script that feels the need to show and tell the audience in no uncertain terms that the creepy little kid is the Antichrist. Moore believes that filming everything in grey, lightless atmosphere will generate tension (as well as disguise the fact it's almost entirely shot in the Czech Republic no matter how many London taxis you add) and relies purely on cheap tricks to generate any tension, the cinematic equivalent of the web pages where you turn the volume high and stare at a web page for ten minutes before Linda Blair pops up.The film is worthy but dull; I don't dare compare it to the original which still terrifies even today. At one point I even found myself feeling sorry for this kid, seeing him as a misunderstood Harry Potter. Having two of the best cast members from that series doesn't serve to dispel the image either. As usual the British contingent is excellent, and Beltrami's score helps the otherwise lifeless film move along. While no Goldsmith, he's quite adept at stealing bits from other good films; the drive to the cemetery is almost identical to the opening score of Batman Begins and had me sorely wishing for an appearance of the Batmobile to take on the servitors of evil. Which in Donner's film could have been hidden anywhere but in this film amount to a pair of hungry dogs and a scrawny housekeeper with bad teeth.Mercifully the cinema I saw this in sells DVDs in the lobby so I bagged the original and settled in for a night of true horror. Personally I would have paid the same money for a sharpened re-release of the original and judging by frequent glances at watches during the film, the majority of the audience would agree with me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Omen looked promising in the previews and commercials on TV but that's where the promise ends. It starts off very slow and, despite brief better moments, remains slow throughout. One success in the movie was that Damien was definitely a creepy looking little kid. If you are considering seeing it be ready to shell out 10 bucks for 2 hours of slow moving storyline. By the end I had wished I had spent the money to go see Over the Hedge instead. At least Over the Hedge would allow for some cheap laughs. The few laughs that came from The Omen occurred in situations that were clearly not meant to be funny, but rather were dumb enough for anyone with basic intelligence to warrant a chuckle. If you are prepared to sit through the two hours of nothing then go ahead, otherwise don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off: yes, it's a faithful remake. A lot of elements that were in the original movie are in here. I had quite a good time, but the acting by Julia Stiles (thoroughly unconvincing performance) and Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick (who only has one line) were sub-par and quite distracting to me. The only outstanding actor I could see in this feature was David Thewlis. Even Mia Farrow wasn't very convincing in her role as the nanny. The mood and pace of the movie are quite enjoyable though. Not much else to say about this movie except: I liked the original much better and with stronger actors, this feature could've been good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heed The Omen, Indeed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, i've never seen the original omen, so i couldn't personally tell which one is better, but i did indeed like this one a lot. There were very good moments made you jump, and the death scenes were very well done and very creative. I thought they also did a good job casting Damien. He really did look pretty damn evil. I really like they way it was shot. all of the scenes were so eerie, it was unsettling. the only flaw in this movie is the ending( you'll see what i mean) but it still didn't ruin the movie 4 me, so it's all good. So whether it's better than the o.g. version or not, i still recommend, because it was a great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>whatever happened to classic horror?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just went out to see this movie with my friends last night after spending an insane amount of time trying to book the tickets online to make it for the very "special" release date. Despite the ominous reviews I read on IMDb, I decided to give it a shot anyway, turned out I should have taken the advice I read. I can't believe that the people who made this movie waited all this time for the 6/6/6 date to release the movie and then messed it up so badly.I'd rather take the 1976 original over this any day, hard to believe that movies have come forward so much over the last 30 years and you can still come up with a remake thats worse than the original. There was absolutely no scare element in the movie, nothing to imply how catastrophic the initial concept was. To add to the misery, the only jumpy moments in the movie was created using underhanded shock tactics that (in my opinion) only horror movies without much of a script go for. And I wasn't the only one who thought so, because the entire cinema hall was roaring with laughter after each and every one of those scenes!!! I honestly think Richard Donner would disapprove of the way his movie has been remade. Apart from being a total waste of time and money for me, in my book, the movie was put together in a really bad way. I honestly expected to come back from the movie feeling a little scared at least, turns out disgust was more what I was feeling. The only reason I'm rating it a 2 is because it still had the original theme. There are many more things I could on and on about but I think I'll stop here for now and advise everyone I can to not go for the movie. You'd be better off renting the 1976 DVD and watching it at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS!!! The John (BEHIND ENEMY LINES) Moore-lensed remake of David Seltzer's THE OMEN is a slam-bang update of the original, a super-classy, A-production horror flick with a first-rate cast, excellent cinematography, terrific score, solid writing and deliberate pacing. Liev Schreiber may never be Gregory Peck, but he is a terrific actor in his own right and here plays a U.S. ambassador who inadvertently sets Armageddon in motion by allowing an orphaned infant to be substituted for his stillborn son. The substitute kid is actually part of a scheme to bring The Devil Himself back to Earth. Truth is, I thought Gregory Peck was too old for the role when the original was made back in the early 1970s, although he certainly gave a dignified if somewhat wooden performance. Schreiber seems more age-appropriate and animated to me. In the Lee Remick role, Julia Stiles holds her own as the ambassador's increasingly disturbed wife, and it is a pleasure to see her playing a mature adult. Considering the various abrupt and sometimes gruesome deaths, Stiles' death scene is sorrowful and horrifying, and almost impossible to watch. The kid playing Damien is almost identical to the original, and he is quite convincing as a devilish tyke. The race-to-the-finish ending is a little hard to swallow. Other than that, this remake of THE OMEN turns out to be a major and pleasant surprise considering all the other recent horror film remakes that have been dogs (THE FOG, anyone?). I predict strong box office for this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As most know horror movies aren't near as good as they used to be. But the psychological scares in this movie were amazing. There were a few scenes that made me jump but nothing too scary. It makes the one watching think. It almost made me believe in God again but alas I will remain atheist. But this movie was a good thriller and it captivates your attention so well. It was graphic and dark, not to mention filmed beautifully. I think the acting was superb, and David Thewlis who has impressed me time and time again did not disappoint. I also think Julia Stiles, new to the horror genre, did a pretty good job as well. Liev Shrieber really shocked me at how well he acted in the film, he was completely believable. I rate this movie an 8 out of 10 definitely a must see for fans of the original or the horror genre in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I beg to differ on the review below!!! That person obviously hasn't even seen the first Omen. I, however, have seen the original over 30 times and the remake is a great compliment to the original. It is much scarier in many DIFFERENT places and is just as scary in the same places as before. There are many parts of this movie that have been revised and they did a great job of doing so. Some parts of the movie that weren't explained in the first movie are explained in this one. This film was brilliantly redone with a modern touch and the events are NOT carbon copies of the events in the first movie, something that I was afraid of before I watched it. I was afraid that this movie would fall right into line with all of the crummy remakes that are being released nowadays, and I was pleasantly surprised that it most certainly did not. This is a great remake of the original and certainly did not disappoint!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't Replace the Original, but Pretty Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They brought the original "Omen" screenwriter on to rewrite his own script. Ambassador Robert Thorn and his wife Katherine had a still birth years ago. Thinking that she couldn't handle the emotional pain, Robert agrees to "switch" babies. He takes an abandoned baby and makes it look as though it is Katherine and his. Little did they know, the child they brought home is not only not human, he is the spawn of Satan.The biggest problem I have with this movie was that they shouldn't have brought on the original screenwriter. You can hear lots of the same lines in the 1976 version of the film with Gregory Peck. Overall, the movie is watchable. It actually has a plot. Liev Schreiber does a wonderful job as Robert. I wasn't crazy about Julia Stiles's performance. The child who played Damien gave unintentionally funny expressions. He didn't match the creepiness of the original Damien.My favorite character, though, was David Thewlis as Jennings, the reporter who tries to unravel the mystery with Robert. He is a wonderful actor.This movie deserves an 8/10. Good, but it can't take the place of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avoid this Omen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen is the reason remakes get such a bad reputation, because it is one of the worst movies of recent memory to make it to a major multiplex. Not mediocre, not middling, but downright, out and out bad. The film has almost nothing to recommend it and everything to reward you for avoiding it at all costs.The Omen begins in Rome, where Vatican astronomers have seen ominous comets in the sky, and along with various other events (such as the World Trade Center bombing and massive hurricanes), have determined that Armageddon is just around the corner. It is at this time, on June 6 to be precise, that Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber), deputy U.S. Ambassador to Italy, discovers that his wife, Katherine (Julia Stiles) has had a stillborn child. A priest in the hospital offers Robert a shred of hope: another child has been born to a mother who died during childbirth, and the babies are switched without anyone knowing. So, the Thorns begin raising Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) and then tragedy strikes: the Ambassador to Italy is promoted to Ambassador to Great Britain, but is then killed in a freak accident and Robert takes over as his duties.Shortly after the move to London, more strange things begin happening: Damien's nanny hangs herself at Damien's birthday party and a crazed priest (Pete Postlethwaite) tells Robert that his son is the son of the Devil and that he will kill the entire family to ensure his ascension to power. The priest shortly meets with a rather grisly fate. Robert doesn't believe the priest at first, but a photographer (David Thewlis) who has taken pictures of both the nanny and the priest notices strange artifacts in the photos: shadows of images that suggest violence occurring to the individuals in the same way they died. Into the fold arrives Damien's new nanny, Mrs. Baylock (Mia Farrow), who is almost obsessive in her protection of Damien, going so far as to bring an attack dog into the house. When more strange events begin happening around Damien, Katherine is certain there is something wrong with her child, and Robert decides to take action.On the face of it, The Omen would seem to be competently made: the cinematography is attractive, even stylish at moments and it's obvious some money was spent on the production. However, this is offset by almost every other element of the film; The Omen unfolds in a long, dreary slog to anti-climax.For those who would argue that remakes on their very face are unnecessary, The Omen gives plenty of fuel to the fire of that point of view. There are no major differences between this version and the original, it is an almost exact replica of the 1976 film, and therefore if you have seen that entry already, there is nothing unique here, and you have seen it all done immensely better.Director John Moore has made The Omen serious to the point of ridiculous; everything is served up without a moment of levity. The film's stolid tone is supposed to lead you to believe that we are watching "important" events unfold when in fact we are viewing some rather cheesy stuff. Add to that the fact that Marco Beltrami's score is dramatic in the extreme, pushing every key moment over the top. There is no subtlety to The Omen, no sense of creepy foreboding. Moore does craft some slightly effective dream sequences and a few decent shock scares, but they are few and far between, and every other moment generates not an iota of suspense. What you are left with is a film that never seems to end, but merely moves forward by sheer momentum alone and you find yourself wondering when it is all going to be over.The leads, Schrieber and Stiles, are stiff and wooden; their emotions and reactions are mostly one note, and their dialogue delivery is generally poor. There is no empathy for these people, they are so without energy or basic acting skill, it would seem, so as to lead you to think you are watching amateurs in a high school play. It is impossible to believe these two as real, living beings and not actors reading from a script. The capper is reserved for Davey-Fitzpatrick as Damien. He is easily the worst child actor in a major film production in some time, because this role requires from him some serious facial emoting, but the best he can come up with is a rather ridiculous, pouty face that is not the least bit menacing, but in fact overly humorous. The only good elements in the film are Mia Farrow and Pete Postlethwaite. They are both effective in their respective roles, although they have limited screen time to make much of an impression, but at least they are diverting to watch. Thewlis is adequate but unspectacular and Michael Gambon manages to use his two minutes of screen time to chew scenery with abandon, since there are no "small" moments to The Omen.An important footnote is that in the theater where this film unspooled, the projector was obviously misadjusted to allow the viewing of boom microphones and set lights, and even a scene with a camera matte box top visible in the frame. The audience had a grand old time with this, laughing at the film throughout. Unfortunately, if the film had been properly projected, it wouldn't have made a difference, because it is such as loss as to not matter. The Omen is one long exercise in tedium, and those who sit through this film will find themselves wondering if the filmmakers are the sons of the Devil for putting the audience through it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remake That's Worth Viewing !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unless a movie is being remade because the original was made before sound, or was made so long ago that the acting has become antiquated, I usually don't see the point in 'remakes'. The majority are not as good as the originals. Not so with this 2006 version of THE OMEN. It is as good, and in some ways better than the 1976 one.Beautiful cinematography of overly dramatic background settings with lots &amp; lots of thunderous downpours, there is also the subtle but effective music supplied by Marco Beltrami on Jerry Goldsmith's scoring. The by now familiar storyline of a politically prominent couple who unbeknown to them are raising the anti-Christ grabs the viewer's attention from the beginning and keeps you entertained throughout.One of the things that I found preferable to the original was casting the more age appropriate JULIA STILES and LIEV SCHREIBER as the parents. STILES particularly. She gives the role of 'Katherine Thorn' both a likability as well as fragile vulnerability. SCHREIBER doesn't possess the command of role predecessor GREGORY PECK, but does well enough. I hadn't seen MIA FARROW in a film in some time and she is excellent as the specious new nanny, 'Mrs. Baylock'. Actor David THEWLIS is good as the photographer 'Keith Jennings' who finds that some of the pictures he takes are predictions of the impending deaths to some of those in Damian's way or need for sacrifice. SEAMUS DAVEY-FITZPATRICK is not as effective as HARVEY STEPHENS was in the original. DAVEY-FITZPATRICK looks grumpy rather than menacingly evil. The film though moves consistently and with continuity. Worth watching and every bit as good as the original !</fullReview>

Maybe it was just a wake up call for the young of today. Great extras on the DVD and well worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated effort with some great moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After several years of raising his son, a US diplomat comes to believe that he's adopted the son of the Antichrist and must try to stop those who are intent on letting his demonic legacy come to fruition.Overall this may be a pointless but surprisingly watchable effort. The fact that this is a remake of the original and doesn't do anything drastically new to the proceedings is definitely the biggest flaw, since this one practically copies the original's plot as well as whole scenes straight from there. This gives the film the feeling of redundancy as it once again shows the couple's son dying in birth, the secretive adoption and the ensuring career change all coming from the original's plot verbatim. As well, the fact that this one features scenes like the arrival at the church, the disastrous birthday party, the tricycle attack and even the scenes of the two retracing the clues of the apocalypse get carried over from the original and manages to feature them shot-for-shot in the new version without deviation, furthering the ties of familiarity here between the two versions. More to the point, both of these issues combine together against this one being so predicable and unnecessary that really hold this one down and make it quite a troublesome effort here when on a fundamental level the effort is challenging to get through. That does make for enough here to hold off the few positives on display which are quite surprising throughout here. The one thing this one gets right is the build-up between the religious prophecies and the actual evil within here, as the opening montage of real-world tragedies leads nicely into the sequences in the first half which signify something is happening. As the coincidences begin piling up and painting a darker picture it becomes all the more obvious and that's quite an enjoyable feat. Likewise, the frantic finale packs a lot of action into this one by really amping up the pacing of events which is much higher at this point despite showcasing the film's fast-paced action at its best, much like it accomplished throughout the rest of this in order to really make for a watchable effort with the pacing in here. Otherwise, it's not all that bad of an effort.Rated R: Graphic Violence, some Language and intense demonic themes.</fullReview>

It's annoying at best, and sacrilege at worst.Liev Schreiber, Julia Stiles, and David Thewlis are all great actors. And it's incredible that Mia Farrow played Mrs. Baylock. It's a well made movie. The problem is we've seen this movie before. We've seen these images before. We've seen the nanny jump off the roof before. We've seen the priest spiked through the chest before.

		<fullReview>Before I begin, let me state for the record I have not seen the original, so cannot make any judgment of this as a remake!As a stand alone film, however, this leaves a lot to be desired, especially considering the pretty capable cast that was lined up. The problem is there is no strong performance from any of the actors, so the result is a pretty turgid film that lacks depth and subtlety. There is no build up in tension, no welling up of foreboding and very little fear induced. The overwhelming feeling is one of predictability, mixed with pointless and unoriginal gore. A man gets his head cut off by a sign and a priest is stabbed by a falling railing, but so mechanical is the build up that the actual instants are cold and almost medical. Was I scared at any point? well no not really. Did I jump? once, but only mildly? Was I immersed into the story? undeniably no.There are occasional good parts - the nanny has some good scenes and watching Pete Postlethwaite is always a pleasure - but aside from these, it's a pretty tepid affair. The kid creates a feeling of mild discomfort, but so much of it is borrowed cliché that it is nothing more than that.All in all, it's a pretty tedious and lacklustre way to spend an evening. Do yourself a favour and learn to knit instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Droll, hollow and mostly uninteresting; there are some jumps and some smirks, as we recall the original, but so what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen is probably a bit better than the average horror film update; remake and reboots that we've had to endure in recent times, but this is as far as praise can realistically go when speaking of it. Penned by the very man who was responsible for the previous three (as well as a 1990's direct to TV special) in David Seltzer, although directed by someone with a rooted interest in updating; remaking and adapting in John Moore, this 2006 revisiting to a pretty spooky 1976 Richard Donner thriller ticks boxes, goes through motions and carries with it a shinier surface - a mixture of exactly what we remember form before (via Seltzer) but with that distinct, polished "bringing it all into the 21st Century" feel of one of Moore's pieces. The question is, as it always is, is: was there really ever any need? No, of course there wasn't; but a marketers dream is to go through all the PR paraphernalia over a film about the coming of The Devil that's due to be released on the sixth day of the sixth month, two-thousand and six. It's superfluous; a tad dull and sexes up some of the more underplayed moments of the '76 original, but is workmanlike.First and foremost, the opening credits are straight out of David Fincher's 1995 masterpiece "Se7en". Painfully so, in fact and that sense of things being rebranded; updated - that whole sense of seeing things in a film you've already encountered, but done better back in the day, hits us this soon. During these credits, a Vatican priest does some serious reading up on the early chapters of his field of expertise: biblical talk of the coming of The Devil; the apocalypse, the rise of evil and the clues it's all going to arrive. Satisfied, he outlines via a lecture for the benefit of his peers, as well as our own, in what is one of the more guilt-edged scenes of exposition teeing things up: that things such as 9/11 and the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami allude to the end of the world.Not so far away in Italy, a certain top-end American politician named Richard Thorn (Schreiber) is arriving at a hospital on account of the fact his wife is about to give birth. She does so, but with an irk of fate that sees the child die and Thorn offered, by a shady looking religious man we know better than to trust in films such as these, an immediate replacement in the form of another new-born whose scenario was inverted in that HIS mother died during the birth. Without wife Katherine (Stiles) knowing, and in a snap moral decision, Thorn accepts the proposal thus allowing everybody to go home happy - so to speak. Alas, it is the spawn of The Devil that the Thorns have taken away with them and he has an agenda: an agenda which begins with a post-Final Destination death sequence allowing for Richard to garner status as America's ambassador to Great Britain before going on to end with the taking over of the world after growing into his inherited position of power.Cue a lot of strangeness, shenanigans and running around trying to work out just what on Earth is going on. Most of the better scenes from before are once again depicted, they've just had a slight rejigging to come across as more.... I'm not sure of the word. The kids would probably use the term "epic". Trips to the zoo no longer consist of animals sensing the evil and charging off. Now, we need scenes wherein these huge gorillas, upon witnessing the kid, attempt to bash the life out of the transparent observation panels around them as everyone else screams and run for cover. When Katherine comes to have THAT little accident involving a stepladder and a potted plant, the film feels the need to draw blood from her face, but we've already sort of been taken out of the moment anyway on account of the fact the tricycle has gone and has been replaced by one of those toy scooters that were popular with kids for all of about two months in 2000.On the issue of having the impact dented, anonymity in the casting process has been replaced with familiarity. I'm reminded of the tag line for Lethal Weapon 4: "The gang's all here!" We get Pete Postlethwaite turning up as the English priest who first contacts Thorn over his son's true nature but the audience let off a smile at the fact we identify him rather than become more engrossed at the horror unfolding. We observe Michael Gambon playing a sprawling, semi-mad priest based where Europe meets Asia and nothing quite seems right anyway, and it's enough to take us out of the moment. We get English actor David Thewlis playing the photojournalist cottoning on to what's happening, but because it's the 21st Century he needs to uncover those famous blemishes on his photographs in those famous scenes via an iMac screen. To be fair, the film does maintain that creepy scene from the original wherein a photo, in a darkroom already bathed in red light, gradually comes to life revealing the truth ? only, it's not creepy here. Mia Farrow pops up as the nanny and the film, to its credit, actually makes better use of her than before. Where the abuse of this quasi star system doesn't rear up, however, is in the lead and his wife: two people I'd never before come across and whose plight I almost got caught up in on the BASIS of anonymity. The film is probably the best of what I've seen of Moore's work, and probably better than either of the original's two sequels, but this is somewhat desperate stuff in the long run.</fullReview>

He just lacks the sense of menace of his 1976 counterpart. Also, honestly, while Satan was all the rage in the 1970's, he became kind of a clownish villain by the oughts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film a few days ago and found the remake Of The Omen to be as good as the original. The film starts off the Vatican observatory priest sees the appearance of a comet, in the sky this makes the Church sure that it confirms the eve of the Armageddon. Meanwhile, whilst this is happening the USA President's godson Robert Thorn is told that his wife Katherine has just lost her baby in the maternity ward in Rome by Father Spiletto. Katherine would not have another pregnancy. Father Spiletto suggests to Robert that another just born child which had lost his mother could take the place for his son, Robert accepts the child and gives him the name of Damien. Robert is promoted to ambassador in London. Soon after there is a tragic accident where Damien's nanny commits suicide at his birthday party. Mrs. Baylock a substitute nanny comes to work and live with the family. As time passes Katherine realises that Damien is evil,and her husband Robert is contacted by Father Brennan, who tells him that Damien is the son of the devil. evidence shows Robert that the boy is the Antichrist. I thought that this was a very good remake of the 1976 film, and had some terrifying senses in it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could've been REALLY bad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK why re-make the 1976 classic-probably one of the most clever, shocking and strangely plausible horrors ever made? It must have been some easy cash, given that it was released on 6/06/06! Having said that, it is quite good and has some genuinely chilling moments. The effects are very good and we get to see some state of the art deaths that seriously update in authenticity from the original. Where the movie falls down, is in the extremely wooden acting from everybody. Reliable British actors, David Thewlis, Michael Gambon and Pete Postlethwaite sleepwalk through the film. Damien comes across as a spoilt brat with a sly wink and a smile at the audience, indicating that he's fully aware of who/what he is. Harvey Stephens who played Damien in the original, seemed innocent and normal which was at odds with all the mayhem that was going on-this made it frightening. The other missing ingredient was the score, Jerry Goldsmithith's original Ave Stani is genuinely terrifying. Watch it and enjoy it and then watch the original. Liev Shrieber, Julia Stiles and Mia Farrow are no match for the brilliant Gregory Peck, Lee Remick and Billie Whitelaw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly inferior, &amp; totally pointless remake of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even if the original film, "The Omen" didn't exist, this sub-par horror effort would be forgettable at best. But because this is a remake of one of the most beautiful, beloved horror classics of all time, the 2006 "Omen" becomes a real chore to sit through. The filmmakers here have managed, while ripping off/paying tribute to a great film, to do just about everything wrong. Starting with the wretched casting. The 1976 film featured Lee Remmick as the wife of the British Ambassader, played to the hilt by Gregory Peck. Remmick and Peck were in their forties, which made sense. But for this brighter, MTV style remake, we have the utterly forgettable Liev Schreiber, and his seemingly "child-bride", Julia Stiles! Preposterous. People in the audience were laughing whenever she was on screen. Yes, Stiles is in her twenties, but she looks like a teenager. In the famous scene where the couple drives to church with Damian, she looks like a little girl playing dress-up in the way too sophisticated outfit, complete with pillbox style hat. It is a mystery why she was cast, as she is also a terrible actress. The rest of the cast was utterly forgettable, delivering their lines, (which were for the most part lifted, word for word from the original), like they were talking in their sleep. With the exception of Mia Farrow as the Nanny, who did manage a strange creepiness. I suppose the makers of this rubbish thought that her name in the credits would lend some much needed legitimacy to this miscarriage of a film. The boy who played Damian was fairly ordinary as well. As for the music? Well, who could forget the chilling Jerry Goldsmith score that graced all three films in the "Omen" trilogy? Powerhouse scores that dripped with evil and religious mystery? What of the score for this remake? I don't know, as I cannot remember it. Whatever music was there was so utterly forgettable, I'm not sure there was any music at all. And the look of the film? Was it a "made for TV" effort? There is not one scene that possesses any atmosphere whatsoever. I waited for my personal favorite scene from the original: the'graveyard scene.' That scene in the ancient, mist-shrouded graveyard, protected by the Rottweillers from hell is one of the most amazingly terrifying scenes in horror film history. The remake managed to ruin this as well. Of course the violence factor is turned up a bit, in an effort to compensate for the countless shortcomings. Yet still, the death scenes in the original were far more effective. The scene where the nanny hangs herself, splatting dully against the wall, rather than crashing through the window, was underwhelming. And the scene that has the priest impaled in the church yard tried so hard to be shocking, but this is a case where less is really more. Although the scene where Miss Baylock, played by Mia Farrow, murders the 'teeny-bopper' mom by injecting an air bubble into her blood tube, topped the original, and was decidedly more sinister than simply having her thrown out of the window. But that was the only scene in the whole film that worked. I implore fans of good cinema, especially quality horror films, to avoid this one and check out the original 1976 film, looking even more majestic in it's 2.35:1 widescreen version, currently available on DVD. I must say I feel a bit sorry for this generation of moviegoers, as what is on offer today is so inferior to the films of the last three decades. Being a fan of the original, i was curious to see this remake, and i went into it with an open mind, after reading many inexplicably good reviews here on IMDb.But I can honestly say, it is not even good enough as a curiosity piece. Stick with the original. And while you are at it, try to hunt down the original DVD of "The Exorcist". Not the amped up "new version," but the original theatrical version, which is hard to find these days. Why can't Hollywood just leave the classic films alone, and come up with something fresh for this generation of movie fans?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a patch on the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not very impressed with this remake, for a start it was very obvious that none of the London scenes were filmed in London, and it was very obvious it was Prague. Putting the London Eye in the background of the US embassy and the house was laughable. In one of the final scenes you see signs on buildings that or not even in English.If you are setting a film in London you should at least attempt to make it look like London, there are more or less no Gothic buildings in London, but plenty in the film, at least in the original they actually used the US Embassy in Soho, I appreciate that would no longer be an option with security these days.The original is one of my favourite films as its dark and creepy.Don't waste your time with this film, re-watch the original its much better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw and loved the original. I saw the trailers for this movie and thought, "Oh crap, another remake!" But then the trailers began to look good. They seemed very much like the original. Of course, I didn't think it possible for this movie to be a lot like the original -- and yet how wrong I was! It was a fantastic movie, almost scene-by-scene like the original Omen. The boy playing Damian was fabulous -- creepy and quiet, just like you'd expect the son of the devil. There was not a bad actor in this movie. There is some gore, but not so much that it could make anyone sick. There was a single curse word in this movie. Unless someone is totally offended by the idea of the son of Satan coming to Earth (and thus hates the plot) then this movie is for everyone over the age of thirteen! Five stars!!! You don't need to see the original to see this, but you MUST see one of them. I will be watching it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy remake. Nothing new, but not bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Somewhat unnecessary, but overall enjoyable and rather effective. This is just one of the first horror movies I saw in the big-screen, and it was good. Although not as great as the original, this remake is well crafted. It has a fine atmosphere, great at producing a scare or two. The film is very similar to the original, since writer David Seltzer recycled much of the script and elements from the first hit film. But he does create a thrilling start, about the prophecy, the coming of the Antichrist. It was really interesting and almost as frightening as they wanted it to be. The cast was okay. Julia Stiles was no match for Lee Remick who landed the role of Kathryn Thorn of the original film, but tackles the role finely. It actually was spooky when she told her husband, Robert (Liev Schreiber), in the hospital the lines "don't let him kill." Sure it was said in the original, but it's fun seeing it again and still get a real kick out of it. Then of course, the main course in THE OMEN table is always the death scenes, and while you already had the chance to see (and took it) in the original, the deaths are still gruesomely remade. Although you saw it in the original, it was a bit scarier now with better special-effects. The performances are decent, with Schreiber in fine form in the Gregory Peck role (honestly, a good replacement). Director John Moore stages it much close to the 1976 thriller, but moves in brisk pace and with never lack of thrills and quality suspense. It's a good throwback to an old-fashioned thriller where plot and characters are far more important than setting up a blood bath. This film is indeed gory, but not without being finely plotted, even if does copy everything the original had already done. This remake was really entertaining, despite some bad criticism. It isn't as original as the original horror cult classic, but just to be fair, why compare? Rating: **** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit I really enjoyed this remake of the original 'Omen' for numerous reasons. Primarily this is one of those films that really works where the majority of remakes of prior films are ultimately dreadful, as has been evident with so many movies. We pretty much would all agree that remakes rarely even equal the original. In the case of 'The Omen 6.6.06', the result is truly unique. The film works well on virtually every level even though this remake rarely dwells far from the material of the original script. One would think that this very fact might have well doomed this remake to a complete waste of time, money, and celluloid. But here are just few reasons I think this film works and works well.The sets are always impressive as is the art direction through out this movie. The supporting musical score is rich with texture and mood through the entire movie without ever going in the direction of predictable or cheesy. The score is also never over bearing for even a second. I also found it interesting to see that scenes when violent moments take place, the film makers chose to take the direction of down playing the gore and possibly topping the original with predictable and silly over the top blood and carnage. As well as these observations, I felt the film was surprisingly well cast and acted. When first being introduced to the various characters my first feeling was- "Oh boy- here we go. This guy just doesn't fit this role". Well as character development continued I am happy to say I was wrong about this perception, especially in the case of Pete Postlewaite's interpretation of the tormented priest. A superb and better than average actor nicely fit into this role. As did Mia Farrow in her part. I was happy to see a classic veteran actor like Farrow finally having the chance to play an evil character. The only side note about her part is not so much the part it's self but realizing that she is still breathtakingly beautiful despite her elder age, and even the less than appealing makeup, clothing, and hair design couldn't hide that fact. There are some superbly shot dream sequences that add a little more scare factor to the film that were not present in the original movie. All in all I felt that there were moments of the original that make it somehow better than this version, and at the same time there was plenty here in this outing that I frankely felt topped the original. And let's face it, the original isn't always perfect either, especially in the earlier character setups of the film. There is an almost "aw-shucks" kind of mood to some of the early portions of the original and I found myself saying "God how cheesy". Moments such as the interrelative sequences between Gregory Peck and lee Remmick after they move into their new English home. It does get a bit hokey at times- let's face it. And the supporting lighter spirited music at times almost gives those scenes an 'As the world turns' sort of flavor. Another example of this is when Damien is wandering outside with his parents and he disappears. When they find him and realize he's OK the music nearly ruins that scene, it's downright silly. Beyond this though the original is a superb horror classic, and after all it was made a pretty long time ago, so it get's a pass for the few and far between weaker moments. So basically I feel that this remake is a solid movie with a great deal of detail, creepiness, and style. it's worth seeing and I think it's much better than many horror movies made over the past 20 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, this is it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never saw the original. As many of you are saying that there is not much difference between the original and the remake. How anyone could ever call this pile of garbage a "classic" or "an intelligent movie" is beyond me. This movie was an embarrassment; and I think the director, actors and producers who made this piece of junk available to consumers should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for being involved. I haven't seen a movie this bad since the remake of "Shaft".OK, so first off, we open with the Pope's "underground secret hi-tech spy room" which we all know does NOT EXIST and the idea of it beyond retarded and seems like something out "Austin Powers". Then we somehow see the writer try to tie in recent events by throwing in the lame and tired correlations of 9/11 and the Tsunami with "what some guy in the bible said". Thats beyond idiotic and stupid and know whats EVEN STUPIDER? How about this initial plot setup NEVER PLAYING ITSELF OUT or ever being mentioned EVER AGAIN. Wow, that was so pointless. Good job! Way to "tie in" the audience.There is zero character development for anyone in the entire movie and I still don't know who/what/where that nanny came from or if she was some demon or some Satan worshiper or what. All of the acting is beyond bad, especially Julia Stiles and that chump lead guy who cant even annunciate his lines audibly so I can understand what the heck he is saying. The kid says like three words and is not scary at all. Oh what, Im supposed to be scared cause his eyes are BRIGHT BLUE?? AHH! SO scary! Oh yeah, and for a movie that was supposed to be about something as scary as umm...the end of the world? This was about as scary as the mascot for the Cincinatti Reds. So what, throw in some angry dogs and a bird skull and I am supposed to lose sleep over that? I see angry dogs every day in New York dog runs, why would one on the screen scare me more? Oh and give me a break with the "our father" and the whole stupid climatic "holy sacrifice in the church" ending. I wanted to throw my Stonyfield Farm frozen yogurt through my new TV. Oh yeah, and why was the swat team chasing the "dad" at the end? Oh, and why is the president at the end? whats the point of that? Why did the dad ditch his wife and son to run around Italy and Palestine to meet with characters who were NEVER INTRODUCED????? Who were these people? what possible proof did the dad have that the skeleton he found in the grave was his real son's??? NONE! What was the point of the pope dying? How did the Nanny possibly kill the mom without ANYONE in the hospital noticing? Why did they get out of the car and walk up to that house rather than drive? and finally, NO ONE lives in a house like that and makes a living as an ambassador!! That house looked like freakin' Versailles! He cant AFFORD VERSAILLES! This was by far (and dumber than "shaft") the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. It has ruined my day today just thinking about it. Completely unrealistic and unbelievable. Take this from the shelves and use it for firewood, the smell it emits when burning is more scary than the movie.</fullReview>

The only exception being the super imposed back drop of the palace of Westminster, which has now moved and is clearly visible from the invented steps of grey(as apposed to white)American embassy. This film does not(like some)have a few simply give aways it is blatantly not London. There are no tramlines in London, no masses of telephone cables strung between lamposts. The shops are not covered in Czech writing, and London has never been full of eastern European Gothic arcitechture. Unbelievably bad. Imagine King King shot in 1930's Berlin.

		<shortDescription>This unnecessary remake adds nothing new.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst not an exact carbon-copy, this remake of the classic 70s horror plays it safe, preferring to stay very faithful to the original plot, rather than to attempt anything radically different. For those familiar with Richard Donner's superb '76 movie, this updated version (release date 6/6/06?very clever!) probably seems like an unnecessary endeavour. Those new to the tale will undoubtedly find much to enjoy, such is the strength of the story, but they would be well advised to seek out the far superior original.This time around, Liev Schrieber takes the role of Robert Thorne (played in the original by Gregory Peck), the American politician who unwittingly adopts Damien, the son of the Devil, and Julia Stiles plays Katherine, his wife, who gradually suspects that the child isn't quite who he seems. And, unfortunately, I lay a large portion of the blame for this film's lack of potency squarely at the feet of Mr. Schrieber and Ms. Stiles. Both lack the necessary acting chops to provide the conviction that the roles require; rather than conveying absolute terror at their predicament, they only ever manage to look 'very concerned'.Director John Moore and writer David Seltzer must share the rest of the blame. The few tweaks that Seltzer has made to the original story are mostly unnecessary padding and Moore weakens the film by replacing the original's foreboding sense of menace with cheap scares.On the plus side, the celebrated death scenes from Donner's movie are convincingly recreated, and the most famous (the gory decapitation) is given a nice new twist. The supporting cast, which comprises of much better actors than the two leads, give great performances; Mia Farrow is wonderfully menacing as Damien's nanny Mrs. Baylock, David Thewlis gives a nice turn as doomed photographer Jennings and Pete Postlethwaite is impressive as Father Brennan.After viewing the movie, I was left asking myself two questions: a) why would anyone choose to watch this over the original (other than out of curiosity)? and b) is it common practice in Rome to brake fuel tankers parked on hills using only a wooden block pushed behind a wheel?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would take great difficulty to express how unbelievably BAD of a movie the Omen is. The acting was utterly ridiculous in every shape and form. As my brother says, there are plot holes big enough to drive Mac trucks through. Ironically, despite the horror genre, the movie wasn't even really scary -- there were two-three moments that made you jump in your seat for pure shock value, but there wasn't anything suspenseful to keep the plot propelled forward. Some very "important" questions about everything -- is the boy's mother actually a dog? how did the nanny become a psycho-killer? -- are simply never addressed. Save yourself your money, your time, and your conscience -- don't see this film.</fullReview>

If the dad did not say Gods prayer Damien could have been done. I also think that some of the shots were a little weird. Why did the mom have to water the plants for ever. Why did the dad have to die. Now the president is stuck with Damien and the script says, the devil will go after politics. How come Damien was not evil when he was a Little baby. I thought Damien could have talked a lot more. He said a bout 4 lines. The mom should have lasted longer. and a air bubble would have done nothing because it would not have gone through with the technology they had. After all it was an excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kym Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh American official Robert Thorne (Liev Schreiber) becomes the proud father of a beautiful boy and is a devoted parent, along with his wife Katherine (Julia Stiles) for the first few years of his life. Then, later in his childhood years, Damien starts to display a worrying tendency for trouble. He doesn't get colds or viruses like other kids, he doesn't seem to mix with the other kids and bizarre, troubling events seem to happen around him. Then Robert is visited by Father Brennan (Pete Postlethwaite) who informs him Damien is not in fact his son but that of the devil's. Initially brushing him off as a crack-pot, Robert soon becomes more suspicious of the increasingly devastating events that are unfolding around him.Regarded by many as a horror classic, the original 1976 version of The Omen, like many that were a bit before my time, is one I never saw (but am tempted to now.) But the trailer did a good job of making it look appealing enough and, ipso facto, I went to see it. Funnily enough, I do remember watching a bit of the original film when it was on the TV in the background one Boxing Day, and the scene where the girl hangs herself by jumping out of the window is one bit I remember seeing from it that was repeated in this one. I'm told by other reviewers that this plays like a scene for scene remake of the last film. 30 years later, though, made to coincide with the sixth day of the sixth month of the sixth year that this year had (when the world did not come to a halt), this is the film I watched from beginning to end. And this one at least was quite a struggle.There's too many long boring bits, as well as a distinct lack of humour and too much of a religious, preachy feel to it. Credit where credit's due though, there's some great jump scenes (one even woke me up and got me back in the story when one of the long boring bits was just about to make me fall asleep), a good (but wasted) supporting cast including Postlethwaite, David Thwelis and Michael Gambon and an appropriately cold and humourless Damien. Mostly, though, re-making this horror classic was more of a bad omen than a good one, the commercial value aside. **</fullReview>

Considering that it is based on a book, one might say the director can't move too far, but it's a godless shame to not move at all. This movie is a disgrace to the art of film making and a marketing success. Bleah!Even the dogs are bad, I tell you. The Rotweiler dogs in the original were more menacing, more purpose bearing. At least in this one they didn't use animatronics or CGI dogs.If you watch it for the first time, you might enjoy it. The mark I gave completely ignores the fact that there was an original.

		<shortDescription>should have titled it "The Oh-Man"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As in, "Oh man, here's yet ANOTHER horror remake..." (Well, I paid for the ticket, so the least I can do is write a review in penance for my misguided selection.) It seemed like a really good idea--take the somewhat dated (yet mostly well-regarded) horror film "The Omen" and make it relevant to a 21st-Century audience. Then again, I suppose that uninspired line is what all big-studio execs use to justify what is really, in the end, simply a ploy to milk dollars from a household name. Like "The Exorcist," "The Omen" is a road-tested horror title that blends Catholicism with life in the public sector and devilish mischief. From what I can remember, the original film combined an intriguing plot with some uneven pacing and indifferent acting (mostly from Gregory Peck, who makes Keanu Reeves look like Olivier), plus a few fine kills. Therefore, I imagined the potential for improvement that could come from this effort.Unfortunately, the success rate of horror remakes within the last five years has been none-too-surprisingly low...if it ain't broke (and it usually ain't), then why go to the trouble? Well, if nothing else, there is a market of uninformed cineasts and curiosity seekers (-raises one guilty hand-) chomping at the bit for the latest slice of gore-greased titillation. In the case of "The Omen," this immense group provides a chance to run off with a bandit's ransom before negative word-of-mouth poisons the box office.This year's remake of "The Hills Have Eyes" did the genre proper--with a director who had proved his horror mettle (with "High Tension"), the template of Wes Craven's original was given not only a superficial modern face-lift, but the film itself crept along with a genuine sense of dread and suspense, tweaking the original story into an innovative new tale. The remake of "The Omen" is a film with similar potential, but becomes increasingly lopsided the further it progresses as the result of some of the central ingredients crucial to any good film.Top-billed Julia Stiles, known primarily for "A Million Other Teen Movies," has the most difficulty with the material--as Catherine Thorn, she emotes and speaks so self-consciously that it transforms her character into an automaton for whom we feel nihil. Liev Schreiber ("The Manchurian Candidate") fares better in the role of Ambassador Robert Thorn, and seems to be channeling the indifference of Gregory Peck, 20 years younger; surprisingly, his detachment works so well that his brief attempts at showing emotion wreck the characterization. In a bit of stunt casting, Mia Farrow plays the nanny, Mrs. Baylock, in such an overtly sinister manner that she invokes Jack Nicholson's out-the-gate insanity in "The Shining." Italian horror fave Giovanni Lombardo Radice ("The Gates of Hell"; "Cannibal Ferox") has a dialog-free scene as a severely scarred priest, and conveys more horror than anything else in the film. David Thewlis takes over the David Warner role, and brings a distinct "Island of Dr. Moreau" sensibility to his performance.Come to think of it, "The Omen"'s central problem may be the way each of its actors seems to be performing in a completely different film. The interactions and dialog scenes are always uncharacteristically off-center, to the point of distraction. John Moore, who directed the film under the duress of meeting its gimmicky release date (6/6/06, isn't that a scream?), seems to have marginalized the actors (who still had the original film as a reference) in favor of recycled technical conventions intended to provoke that effect known as...(yawn)..."shock." Unfortunately, another important area where the film fails is in creating suspense. Save for one or two out-of-left-field "jump" scenes, the horror of this "Omen" is always telegraphed well in advance, to the point where one can sharpshoot a scare from a mile away (the balcony scene is a prime example of this). The film is adrift in too many instances of terror-orgasm-diffusion. There is a frustrating lack of risk in the production as a whole that makes the experience maddening; too afraid of doing something new, we're left with the continual reminder of how good yesteryear's leftovers tasted.I recalled Gus Van Sant's "Psycho" remake with unsurprising frequency during my viewing of "The Omen." In that 1998 stunt (which others have claimed started this whole wave of rotten remakes), a director with marginal talent (at best) tried to outdo (or at least equal) Hitchcock's original with a shot-for-shot retelling. Granted, we got some arbitrary flash-cuts of macabre images during the murders and lonely Norman Bates pounding one out to Marion Crane, in addition to some amped-up gore. Even though I didn't loathe the film as much as the world at large, it did little except draw attention to Van Sant's glaring limitations as a filmmaker. Really, what is the point in remaking something if you're going to leave it relatively unchanged? "The Omen" is a similar stunt that carries a draining, time-wasting effect. Augmenting the timely release date, the film's prologue includes a Vatican-sponsored montage of current disasters (9/11, Hurricane Katrina, etc.) that do, for the sake of this movie, point to the Antichrist's imminent arrival! Save for this bit of armchair prophecy, the film feels relatively unchanged from its source--sure, it looks more slick and employs modern technology (digital cameras! guns with laser-sights!), but that's no excuse for sinking $60 million into something like this. Nor is the promise of murders so shallowly extravagant they inspire bad laughs (watch for the photographer's 'break dance' down some stairs--you won't miss it) and make one long for the days when fear wasn't measured by buckets of Karo Syrup and red dye.If "The Omen" signals the end times for anything, let's hope it's this rash of needless remakes. Damien, you've infiltrated Hollywood with this dire flick...it's time to finish the job!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All in all....not so bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to start by saying that when I saw the first teaser several months ago, and saw that a remake of what I consider one of the 70's most classic horror films was being made, I was highly upset and had actually considered actively boycotting the film (even to go so far as to be a one man protest march complete with picket sign!). Eventually as trailers became available, and I started finding out who would be in the film, a finally decided "Why Not". I'm glad I gave it a try. All in all, it is I believe a very commendable &amp; faithful remake.I was pleased to see the story line really was not toyed with, and even though some changes were made in some of the classic "accident" scenes, it wasn't enough to ruin the film (I actually like that Mrs. Baylock gets mowed down....I always felt she deserved a more brutal death!).I give kudos to Liev &amp; Julia for stepping into the shoes of Gregory Peck &amp; Lee Remick, but let's face it, those are some pretty big shoes to fill.Having several decades of Horror film watching under my belt, and now witnessing remake after relentless remake (are there no original writers left?), the idea of an Omen remake did have me roiling in my skin but I have to say....Someone Finally Did One Right! PS: this is not a license to try remaking further classics. Please, DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT attempt this with The Exorcist! Please leave well enough alone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the original movie in '76, and it still haunts me to this day. The scene where Thorne has to ritually stab the boy, even though he is the Antichrist, still looks like a little boy, saying "Daddy please- No!" really gets me. Also frightening to me was the graveyard scene and the dogs, as well as the scene where Mrs. Baylock tries to stop Thorne. Incedently, I thought casting Mia Farrow in this role was pure genius!! I think the entire cast was magnificent, as well as the special effects and the special effects make-up. Although I pretty much knew what was coming, I still found myself squirming in my seat a few times. All in all, a good way to spend a couple hours. Go see the movie if you dare, but don't see it alone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good horror remake is probably going to be enjoyed more if you haven't seen the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the better recent retreads of 1970's horror films.Okay you know the drill The Thorn baby dies in child birth so in order to protect the mother's feelings the father agrees to substitute another newborn, little knowing that the child is literally hell-spawn and will leave a trail of death in his wake.Well made and mostly well acted this is remake of one of the touch stones of 1970's film. Not wanting to mess with the original too much this is at times a close sibling of the first film and for the most part the film works well and it has some nice chills (the opening explanation of the bible prophecy is great).Regrettably there are problems which keep this from being the outstanding film it should have been.First off the film is at times very cold. There is something distancing about the film. I could watch it as a very scary story being portrayed before me, but the chills didn't last. Out in the sunshine the films power withered.Part of this is the result of Liev Schrieber who is a bit too internal for my tastes. Yes he's good but he's awfully remote. Since you can't connect to him you don't fully buy into the story.Since we never buy into whats going on completely you see all of the flaws and ridiculousness in the story. These flaws were in the original but Gregory Peck sucked you in and you never noticed how stupid it all was. It doesn't help that it may be a bit too close to the original for its own good. Its been awhile but it seems that they may have cribbed a bit too much from the original. With out enough surprises we're left to compare and really think about what you are seeing, which is not a good thing in a horror movie.Making everything worse is the brat playing Damien is too demonic from the get go. He's just a hellish child and its hard to believe that anyone couldn't see he's the devil incarnate. In the original there was a tiny bit of doubt, here there is not, this kid is bad, which makes you wonder how long he's last among real kids. It doesn't help that he just glares at everyone and everything (something he did even in interviews creeping out journalists) and never generates any sympathy (which the devil would have to do).I liked this film a great deal, actually more than I thought but in the end I was disappointed because it wasn't better than it was.6.5 or 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre celebration of the Anti-Christ's birth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to start? I have to admit that "Omen 666" or "Omen remake" is visually stunning. The cinematography is perfect and the combination of dark and light fits with the movie's macabre tone. Technology really helped for the movie's atmosphere... and that's the only positive thing about the movie.The original movie is macabre, perfectly written, it has excellent acting, direction, and a sinister score. It crafts a sentimental relationship between the couple and how they suffer because of their son (the son of the Devil). In this movie there's little emotion between the main characters and Damien shows minimal (if any) emotions. I mean, the original Damien really looks like the Devil himself! that was one creepy kid with an attitude. 2006's Damien looks uncomfortable with the role and looks as looks like he didn't know what the movie was about.Anyways, this new version doesn't offers anything new besides the 911 footage and the horrors of the Tsunami. Those scenes in my opinion were used just to cause polemic but are sadly wasted. The use of CGI didn't hurt this movie like many others from the new millennium. The death scenes are excellent and that may be the strongest thing about the movie. Not to mention the acting with has perfect by Liev Schreiber who demonstrates that he's a mature, solid actor. Julia Stiles in my opinion is miscast. She doesn't looks terrified or disturbed when necessary. Go back to the dance floor girl! Mia Farrow delivers a creepy performance as the devil's assistant. She did look creepy by the way. I didn't like how she looked like a creature from "Army Of Darkness" in her final scene. Also, the nightmare sequences were very well done. The director really knows what a nightmare is. Those 2 scenes were the best in the movie. But two scenes aren't enough to carry the whole movie.Omen 666 is a poor excuse to "celebrate" the supposedly birth of the anti-Christ (how many times have we heard about it?). The result is a millionaire publicity campaign that captivated consumers of Hollywood. Go watch this movie only for pop-corn purposes; I mean, waste almost two hours of your life.Instead of this, watch the original "Omen" or "El Dia de la Bestia". Now, that's real Anti-Christ fun.</fullReview>

The original was by far not stellar at all, even though it had the amazing "Gregory Peck". I must say I was impressed by this re-make, the atmosphere was extremely spooky right from the start. Liev Schreiber was amazing in the role of Damien's father, and the mother played by Julia Stiles was perfect for the part. The story had a few flaws but not enough to notice unless you were flipping through your bible while watching the movie. There were many times I found myself jumping at some of the 'scarier' parts of the movie, but thankfully they weren't obvious like most typical movies of the genre. I think 'the Omen' is the perfect blend of horror and drama, and is definitely worth checking out in theatres..:cHeFZ:.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good remake! **** out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen has always been one of my favorite horror films so of course I'm going to be somewhat hesitant on seeing a remake of such. Secretly though for years I had always fantasized about how I would remake the film and add little touches here and there. Nothing that would improve upon the original but just things I felt would go well with a retelling.Thankfully this film is pretty much the route I would have gone with. Many people have complained about how it is so much like the original. Personally, I felt even though the story structure and most of the death scenes were alike, it wasn't shot by shot the same film (like the Psycho remake). It went in it's own direction.I'm glad David Seltzer, writer of the original, came back to spruce up things.The kid who plays Damien is absolutely fantastic. Cold and emotionless he had an aura about him that certainly felt evil. Liev Schreiber is great as always. By far one of the greatest and most underrated actors today in movies. And I loved the appearances by Pete Postlethwaite, Michael Gambon, and Mia Farrow.I was bowled over with excitement that Marco Beltrami was on board to score the film. To me he has been the Jerry Goldmsith of the 21st Century and it was only appropriate that he score the remake of a film Goldsmith had scored years ago. He does a great job at doing his own thing and only hints at the themes that were used in the original. It's not a landmark score and of course doesn't surpass the classic original, but it's still a non-conventional, appropriate and effective score.There are nuances and subliminalities here and there which I appreciated. A key moment I loved was when Stiles is in the bathtub and sees her 'son' watching her. What happens during this scene will really disturb you. The scenes that were best recreated in my opinion were the 'falling over the balcony' scene where Stiles is pushed over by Damien and the cemetery scene where the dogs attack. There was an unexpected moment of humor before the infamous 'nanny hanging' scene where not just everyone is staring but also two Punch and Judy puppets.It's directed well, atmospheric, and even emotional. It may not be a classic, but no one should have ever expected that. This is one of the remakes that succeeds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He's a Devil of Son !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen has been dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century, and the remake is not bad considering everything. There is a clever move to lock it into the 6/6/06 date, with a new prologue, and a general modernization of the story accordingly. The ingenious plot concerns a US Ambassador Robert Thorn whose "son" seems to cause some horrific deaths, and may be a Satanist child, the Antichrist as prophesied in Revelations.It remains faithful by and large to the novel and the first movie that starred Gregory Peck. If it is less sharp in its pace, it adds a couple of shock cuts that work well. So while we might miss the tighter direction of Richard Donner, the effects are very good and the photography and editing also of a high standard with some suitably exotic locations.Though Leiv Schrieber lacks the gravitas of Gregory Peck, who was older in the part at the end of his distinguished career, (though not his finest performance) Schrieber manages to deliver his lines with something of a resonance of Peck. Less satisfactory is Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick as Damien, who lacks the evil eye of the original's Harvey Stephens. While it was neat idea to have Mia Farrow as the malevolent governess Mrs. Baylock, (a reference to Rosemary's Baby which covered similar ground), her first appearance rather suggests Mary Poppins, and it seems hard for her to then make the role as threatening as did Billie Whitelaw.Neither do Julia Stiles as Karen (the long suffering wife) nor David Thewlis as the photographer Keith Jennings improve on the performances of Lee Remick and David Warner. However both Postlethwaite and Gamon provide some strong characterization. You may well wonder why it took so long for Thorn to wake up about his daemonic son, you'd only have to look at the drawings by the kid pasted on the nursery walls of all places, to realize the lad has some serious problems.In the early 1970s there was a sudden interest in the Devil and all his works, with films like Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, The Omen, etc. mostly they were well made and with good casts and directors, its hard to improve on the originals even with today's film technology. So why do we bother remaking big features from the past, perhaps so a new generation can see them, but usually the revival is lacking the spark that set off the original idea, and sometimes the story has simply become old hat - just as Poseidon really sank itself the second time round. However in fairness The Omen 2006 is well worth a viewing, if you haven't seen the first version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fabulously scary remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had trepidation about seeing a modern remake of such a masterpiece of horror as the original 1976 The Omen, directed by Dick Donner, especially when the new version was cast with much younger actors. I have to say, however, that the end result was not only chillingly scary but even more believable, especially for a modern audience.For example, Mia Farrow offered a less cliché minion-of-Hell-in-nanny's-clothing than the original Mrs. Baylock. As a result, with a couple of subtle scene adjustments such as a résumé and a ringing phone, I was much more willing to believe the parents' willingness to trust this unknown woman who mysteriously appeared to care for their son.Also, by adding an extra death in the beginning (that of the original Ambassador to Great Britain) the pattern became clearer earlier on in the movie - that Damien was born with a specific mission and was going to eliminate whatever and whoever stood in his way.I was baffled at the mismatched dogs, however. Did anyone else notice that the black dog in the beginning (when the original nanny hung herself) was not the Rottweiler used later in the movie? My memory of the original isn't perfect but I always thought it was the same dog throughout.All told, The Omen 2006, has stayed true and done justice to the original, and thanks to great direction and acting, has the legs to stand on its own as a classic of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror symbolism 101 - another lazy cover version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Liev Schreiber was part of a very important horror movie. Ten years ago, he was in "Scream", a movie that made horror funny. And now, today, he's done it again. The Omen is a movie that takes itself SO seriously, it becomes a parody of itself halfway through. Disastrously po-faced, John Moore is so amazed at how awesome his director of photography is, he jump cuts, steadicams and desaturates as fast as he can. But while the original movie built up a claustrophobic dread - a slow build to the awful truths that lay along the way, the 2006 cover version does away with that - that might require talent. Instead, it takes the main set pieces and links them together with lumpen dialogue, sledgehammer symbolism and dreadful music. The uneasiness you feel in the modern Omen is down to not knowing when the next cheap scare will be - a music sting from nowhere, or a flash of an image that has no relevance to the movie, but, y'know - LOOKS EVIL.If Hollywood insists on continually remaking good movies, can you at least do it properly? I mean, how hard is it to do the Omen well? this film is yet another example of how mentally bankrupt some studios have become.It gets two stars for making me laugh out loud in several places. Can someone PLEASE give Liev Schreiber a better movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Better Remakes I've Seen Recently.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I'm sorry to have to admit this but this movie wasn't actually that bad. Granted, it's about an 85% carbon copy of the original that didn't need to be remade in the first place but it was and now it's out there so I am just going to judge it for what it turned out to be.Let's start with the good: The performances are great, especially Liev Schreiber. He is the glue that holds this film together. Julia Stiles gives a decent performance too and that kills me to say that because normally I don't care for her. Great supporting cast as well. Mia Farrow looks like she is having a lot of fun in the role of Mrs. Baylock and the very underrated David Thewlis steps into the role of the ill fated photographer. And then of course there is the brilliant Pete Postlethwaite as the priest who is facing a ticking time clock on the eternal damnation of his soul. The only casting choice that didn't work for me was Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick in the iconic role of Damien Thorn. Is he cute? Sure. But Damien isn't suppose to be cute. He's suppose to be cold and emotionless. Any attempt that is made by Seamus to be scary merely comes off as being hilarious.The cinematography is beautiful and the imagery is freaky as hell. Though the plot is predictable due to how straightforward this adaption follows the original, there are still scares a plenty. Some moments are incredibly disturbing so think twice before you take 5 year old Johnny to see this.Speaking of disturbing, let's get to those death scenes.I thought the beheading of the photographer in the first one was impressive but in this one it is just downright spectacular!!! It almost made me leap out of my seat and shout out such ghetto soaked phrases as "AW, SNAP!!!" and "NO THEY DIDDDDDDNNNNNN'TTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!" Mia Farrow's send off is priceless as well! Now, let's get to the bad: There is a loooooooonnnnnngggggggg slow spot in the middle. Try to hang in there though because the last half hour is worth the wait! Now, I know there are very few people on this Earth who are not aware of the contents of the book of revelations. The makers of "The Omen' remake do not share this confidence in the audience. They feel the need to explain it about 15 or 16 times during the course of the film. It kinda of makes you want to rip your hair out and scream "WE GET IT!!!!! BIG BEN, PARLIMENT!!!!! LET'S MOVE ON NOW!!!!! Okay, you get the chance to remake "The Omen". Here's a thought: WHY NOT SHOW THE SCENE WHERE THE JACKAL GIVES BIRTH TO DAMIEN?!!! You know everybody wants to see that!!!! That's how I would have done it! That's how I roll! But all in all, this is one of the better remakes I've seen recently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the most horrible productions I have ever seen in my entire life. It was pure torture but only if you thought of it as a horror film. It was more like a comedy. This movie was filled with hilarious moments as well as clichés and obvious twists and turns which would only scare someone who previously had never been introduced to any form of cinema. The best actor in the movie was Julia Stiles which is so sad.The little boy was gross. I really wanted him to die. Mia Farrow feeds him strawberries in one scene and the sexual tension was palpable. It was really disturbing and not in a good way.BUT IT HAD ITS GOOD POINTS! The scene where Mia Farrow dies is priceless! She is the nanny of the disgusting little kid and "Satan's Little Helper". The dad goes in to cut Damien's hair to see the birth mark and she ATTACKS HIM! It was amazing because he beats her and then kicks her in the face. After he grabs Damien and takes him into the car, Mia proceeds to smash the windshield with a sledge hammer. Then the dad hits her with the car and she just flies over the top of it. God it was gross; I stood up and clapped. It almost made the movie worth while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit it, I haven't seen the original one, but the remake was mighty good! all right, so I can't compare them. But I think most of the actors did really good in their respective roles (especially Mia Farrow as Mrs. Baylock - she had this sadistic psycho thing hidden beneath a Mary Poppins - and David Thewlis as Keith Jennings - because Thewlis is simply a magnificent actor) and the effects were awesome as well.Scary? Hell yes. Dream sequences, as clichéd as they may be, always, ALWAYS, scare the hell out of you. People in the theater actually laughed after them - but not because they weren't scary. More like people laughing at themselves for jumping to the roof, people asking their friends if they were OK, people swearing, etc. I, for one, recited my entire swearword repertory after the first dream sequence, and the one from Robert Thorne - not quite sure which one was it - I didn't watch it. Feel free to think of me whatever you want. I saw the priest and the boy and when it dawned on me that this was another dream, yes, I covered my eyes. For the same reason I missed half the fight with the nanny and robert thorne - quite short, by the way, what's up with that?There were some things that were pretty unreal - like the rain. And I'm sorry, but what are the odds of having those downpours every single day? Also father Spiletto was...i don't know another word to say this... Voldemort. Or a Lord of the ring's orc that had been exposed to some form of radiation. It was too fake! I mean what would the poor guy have been through to end up like that?Geez I could go on and on but it's late and now I'm going to sleep and have a lot of nightmares about the bathtub scene (honest)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In all honesty, I was never a fan of the original Omen movies. I found them generally boring, ineffective, and flat all the way around. Still, when I started seeing ads for the remake I though that maybe ? just maybe ? with all the new technology available and a little re-writing, this could have been turned into something worth seeing.It wasn't. Oh, how it wasn't.As for the ads, those flashes you see in the trailers and TV commercials are all that you'll see of those images in the movie. In fact, all of those scary moments are inserted into the story as dream sequences. The rest of the film plods along so lamely that by the time something marginally exciting happens, you'll be too deeply asleep to care.Lead actor Liev Schreiber managed to get through almost the entire film without displaying a trace of emotion. He spends most of his on-screen time staring straight ahead and reciting his lines in a monotone sure to induce drowsiness in even the most caffeine-sodden insomniac. Still, his performance is better than that of child actor Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick who barely has any lines at all and generally mugs and looks pouty for the camera. Julia Stiles is a bit better and Mia Farrow actually manages to be simultaneously frail and menacing in spots. The rest of the cast is just window dressing, really, and their roles are formulaic.There is one realistic-looking beheading, three or four dog attacks, and a priest-kabob that isn't nearly as effective as director John Moore apparently thinks it is (and when did newspapers start running gory images of accident victims on page 1, anyhow?) The camera work itself alternates between a seemingly endless fixed shot and sudden nauseating vibrations that take place presumably to try and insert feeling into scenes that threaten to develop frostbite under Liev Schreiber's icy, lifeless stare.All in all, this is pretty weak stuff. If this is the best the son of the devil can do, we don't have much to worry about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only thing this movie had going for it, was the 6-6-06 hype. Seriously. I've never seen a longer, more dragged out, more BORING movie since, well EVER!The only scary thing about the movie was that they actually had enough script to pull off over 2 hours worth of film.Usually, the slowest part of the movie is the character development. then it gradually gets better from there. Well, in this movie there really is no character development, and yet it still surprisingly is able to maintain that slow boredom inducing rhythm that sadly lasts throughout the film. Even the "Scary" scenes are so dragged out and extremely predictable that it has you making sighing noises rather than gasping ones. Some scenes were So dragged out you wanted to go "Damien". Like the scene with the priest who had no face... when the guy is begging him to talk. you want to scream"TALK FOR GOD'S SAKE JUST SAY SOMETHING! ANYTHING! JUST MOVE THIS SCENE ALONG! DO SOMETHING INTERESTING PLEASE!"after about just under 2 hours, and no end in sight, I decided if I had to sit through 15 more minutes I was going go evil on the movie screen. So my friends and I packed up and left.The only regret is not finding out what happens to the photographer. He was the only likable character in the movie.so all in all1. just because it comes out on 6-6-06 does not make it scary 2. boring movie 3. very boring movie 4. VERY boring movie.I do not recommend this one. Usually I'm the one who says "its up to you. go see it and see what you think." but in this case. Save yourself the cash. The tag line instead of "his day will come" should be "his day will come. most people won't notice, and the rest will be too bored to care."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>actually i was somewhat frightened that they would totally screw it up, but they didn't. The casting was well done. The child they cast to play Damien was creepy but not as creepy as the kid in the 1976 version. Yes once again the dogs scared me to the same level even thou I knew what was going to happen. John Moore directed this film well and the way he "modernized" the film so that it reflected the present time was the correct thing to do. By doing that Moore was able to keep to the main plot while adding in smaller things like a Scooter instead of a tricycle, or rifle guns with laser sights. I am a huge fan of the original and glad to see that there was some new scenes that were not in the first one so it is worthy of being called a well done remake but still not better than the original.</fullReview>

The only part of the movie that made me jump was when the two dogs came bolting out at the father and the photographer in the graveyard. The acting was poor, the lines felt like they were read and sounded unnatural. Many of the scenes that should have been scary and/or exciting were anticlimactic, such as the scene where the nanny hung herself, the scene could have been shot and done a lot better, it just seemed something was missing. The Music was bad all around, and the scenes where Father Brennan and the photographer die are lame, they made it painfully obvious what was going to happen about a full minute before it happened. The kid was awesome though, pretty creepy and his face throughout would haunt many people's dreams. This could have been an amazing movie but it fell well short of my high expectations, sub par at best</fullReview>

Since this is the first time I saw this storyline, I thought it was very well done and unique. Though it lapsed in certain details and the performances of Julia Stiles and Leiv Schreiber were kind of weak it was all made up for by the actor who plays Damien. That kid is just creepy and his nanny did a great job too. I wont spoil anything, but all I can say was when I got back home from this film it was thundering, all the lights in my house were off, everyone was asleep, and I was scared SH*TLESS. I kept dreading the appearance of that kid...looking in the mirror...thinking he'd just appear behind me or something. It had that affect on me and any scary movie that affects me after the actual viewing experience I consider to have been well made.Now I shall await the nightmares.Also, I usually don't get this readily scared from movies so either I am just especially wussy tonight or this movie rocked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Omen was one of the greatest horror films of its time, and it's hard to compare it to its contemporary. I watched the original about one week before seeing the new one, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought it was a great story and a great example of good film making. I was excited to see the new version, and was satisfied after seeing it. Personally I enjoyed the newer version more. I think Liev Schreiber did an incredible job and fit his role well. Julia Stiles did well, but she was not who I would have picked to play the role. The child who played Damien did well, although he seemed too cute for the role. I think the director was wise as to not give him too many lines. I believe a majority of the acting was superior to the '76 version. I find the acting in the original to be somewhat overdone and cheesy. Another bright spot in the film was the additions. I think all of the additional scenes helped clarify the story. The signs of the coming of the anti-Christ set the mood of the film. Kathy's dreams helped raise the suspense and also show the audience why she was in such distress over Damien. Although the additions were small in number, I think they helped the film. Overall, they stuck to the original film and did very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There should have been more description on the significance of "666". Barely any horror scenes. Some scenes with the cast speaking in Italian has no subtitles?!The only scene which you should look out for is at the hospital.The movie seems to be made up of bits and pieces of different scene. You don't see a linkage between the scenes. The story line is also definitely not clear as well. All you know is that 666 means Damien is an evil child. Movie is based on the assumption that audience knows what 666 is about and all the destruction must have been done by the "devil".Compared to the old movie back in 1976, there is much more to be improved upon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the movie itself is build up by an older one so i didn't expected anything from this movie and even so i got disappointed it was bad as in very bad and if u don't agree then u shouldn't read on. reason why this movie was bad: 1 the scene in the bath room where Katherine Thorn sundently bleeds and sees the son Damien with that mask on. (u can also see Damien in the commercials wearing the mask)That is the only part of the movie where u see him with the mask and it is only for a half sec with a "scary noise" in the background... Well this scene has no other F(_)CKI|\|G (sory the language) reason to be there than to give u a chock. it has no real part of the story! This is clearly just to keep u awake in the movie. 2 there is a one more scene in the bathroom it is the same story as the first reason well i know that without these scenes it wouldn't bee the same but if they wanna give people a chock they have to do it RIGHT! 3 the story itself is just too boring (i know that it is a matter of taste) and that is why i give it a 5 because it wasn't my cop of tea</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing that gets me here is the hype. 6/6/06 release date supposed to be the new great horror remake. blah blah blah. The movie just falls flat out short of these expectations. I gave it a five for the 5 good scenes. This hardly justifies a good movie however. The plot deviated very little from the first, matter a fact it was nearly the exact same just with added spices of gore that the original lacked. The acting was half hearted, especially Liev Schrieber. The kid that played Damien however was quite creepy and kept the movie at least honest in an attempt to be classified as a horror film. Personally I laughed at the supposed scary parts as did much of the theater i was in. Too predictable and the scenes had just been done before making them lose the suspenseful edge. I left thinking well it wasn't bad but sure as hell wasn't good, not a bad way to pass a Tuesday night if your bored or curious about the film but certainly not worth your time if u want to see a good horror flick. For a real good remake watch the Hills Have Eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Worth It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original OMEN is one of my favorite horror films and I have to admit I was pretty excited to see the remake. In retrospect, this was a bit foolish of me considering practically every remake Hollywood's perpetrated in the last 10 years has been god-awful (with the possible exception of Manchurian Candidate). This one is equally unfortunate, blending unnecessarily flashy camera-work, an over-the-top soundtrack, mediocre acting, and just plain lazy storytelling. Liev Schreiber is a fine actor and does his best here, but you can't help but feel he's "phoning it in", especially during his repeated episodes of blubbering; one longs for the gravitas of Gregory Peck. I've never been a fan of Julia Stiles and she is woefully miscast here, lending more of an amateurish quality to the film. The supporting cast fares better with Mia Farrow (in a bit of stunt casting that actually works) as the creepy nanny, and reliable British actors David Thewlis, Pete Postlethwaite, and Michael Gambon chewing the scenery. I couldn't quite figure out why elements that worked so well in the original film played out so ineffectively here, almost laughable. I think that a lot of it actually had to do with young Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick, who plays the little devil child. In the original film, Harvey Stephens was creepy without even trying. This performance tries very hard to affect us and fails. There are a few unfortunate shots of Damien where it looks like the actor's been directed to look really constipated. I didn't buy it for a second and I think it added to the film's overall schlockiness. The original OMEN is an effective thriller and succeeded in telling this story perfectly. I guess I've learned my lessons for future remakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than the crude marketing gimmick suggested</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll say that I went to see this film purely because of the 06/06/06 marketing gimmick. I've not seen the original, I taped it off TV once, but when I played it back there was no sound so... yeah anyway, The Omen 666 then... Initial impressions started quite low, despite having been bombarded with a very impressive cast in the opening credits, I thought I was in for just another one of those horror films with a "scary" kid character, and after my last experience with one of those - "Hide and Seek", I wasn't keen on watching another one. My low expectations (it is a "hollywood remake" after all, two words that would send any elitist art-house type film lover running for the hills to gauge their eyes out) were shortly dashed when the film really got going and I really enjoyed it. I won't go into too much plot detail, as surely everyone knows what this film is about, but I will say that it mixes mild horror with mystery and thriller very well, with part of the film sending two characters on a Da Vinci Code-esquire, country hopping trail. As far as elements you'd expect to see in a decent film, there's some quite good acting (a little bad acting), but Liev Schreiber in particular, given a decent lead role grabs it both hands and really delivered. Score and cinematography were both of a high standard, and more so the production design, who looks like he watched David Fincher's Seven at breakfast everyday before he went to work. So was it scary? Well... I don't think I can be a reasonable judge of horror films in general. Being exposed to too many as a kid has rendered me desensitised, but there were a few moments I did find genuinely disturbing despite the low 15 certificate. The Omen remake is a fairly well made horror film, so as with most horror films, if you don't take it too seriously, you should enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My review (warning: minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly not the best movie ever made, but definitively one of the best remakes ever made. Wow, this movie rocks, completely loyal to the original story, this film never stops scaring you. I saw it, a few hours ago and although today audiences don't take this kind of movies seriously there were quite a few moviegoers literally jumping off their seats, there is never a dull moment. If you have seen the original, the sequence of deaths takes place the same way we saw it in the original film, but the circumstances surrounding some of the deaths are a little bit different yet that does not hurt the film since the audience I saw it with was thrilled and amazed during the opening screening in my country (Guatemala). While watching this movie I realize I am getting old (32) since most of the audience was younger people (18-25). I realized that this youngsters (or most of them) have never seen the original cause they were shocked with many of the disturbing scenes, and the ending (the same ending than the original) was unexpected to them. So, if you haven't seen it, go, take my advice, this is one of the best movies of the year, a definitive DVD own when released, it doesn't matter if you have seen the original, it doesn't matter if you have NOT seen the original, the remake is a solid film worth watching. You will enjoy it, I guarantee it. Thank you for your attention.Sincerely: Orjg2 Oscar</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True to the original with some surprises of its own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie opening night, because I'm such a big fan of the original. The story-line was true to the original movie, and in fact this remake uses the same scriptwriter as the first. The cast is great--Mia Farrow (Rosemary's Baby) plays the demonic nanny, Michael Gambon (Dumbledore in the newer Harry Potter movies) reprises his role as Bugenhagen, David Thewlis (Professor Lupin in Harry Potter) plays the prophetic photographer--and these are all secondary roles! As for the movie itself, it was beautifully shot. The use of color to set mood is even more pronounced than in the original version. The movie's timing was spot on, and even though I've seen The Omen countless times before, I still found myself jumping in my seat at times. Unlike many movies today, the shock of being taken by surprise is very well done here. I also enjoyed the special effects, especially surrounding the death scenes.All in all, I was so taken by this remake that I'm planning to see it again very soon. I was absolutely delighted by this movie, because it succeeds where so many other horror/suspense movies fail--it's clever, cinematographically beautiful, has brilliant timing, thoughtful acting, and doesn't rely on too much blood or cheap tricks to carry the story. Any fan of the first movie will be a fan of the remake, as will any film geek, and many more people who are seeing the movie for the first time. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Omen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always loved the original so I didn't set my expectations too high for this film. Inspired merely by a spur of the moment thing (it was the 6th of the 6th of the 6th after all so what better thing to do than watch The Omen) I can say that I was very pleasantly surprised...The acting, the atmosphere, the chills, the thrills and the outstanding effects were spot on and I don't think I could really find a fault in any it (or if there is then I was so engrossed by the whole thing that it passed me by)... The whole story, whether the original or, now, the remake is very tightly packaged. And what of the actors? Well Liev Schreiber has a major problem in that Robert Thorn, in the original, was played by the much loved actor Gregory Peck. And because of this Schreiber will always be compared to the legendary actor. But Schreiber manages to act up a little storm all of his very own. I found him convincing enough to pull off the role.Mia Farrow is superbly cast as nanny, Mrs Baylock. She plays the role a little nicer than her predecessor which makes the role that much more unsettling for us as an audience when she... Well, I'll leave you to see the film. Together she and Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick (Damien) build up an excellent screen rapport and create a somewhat unsettling chemistry.David Thewlis was one of my highlights though as he provides excellent support to Liev Schreiber and managed to convince me in his role.I'm not saying the original isn't better because it is. But this film has a ballsy try at approaching a much loved classic horror from a new angle and makes it much more contemporary so as to fit in with todays audiences.The deaths are far more graphic and, in my opinion, work a lot better. There are also plenty of "jump-out-of-your-skin" moments none of which I will mention here.Although the original is a better film on the whole there is still in places with the remake a greater feeling of dread and the whole thing just seems much more plausible and much closer to hand thanks to the use of linking key news events to passages in the Bible. In short, I found the remake considerably more unsettling and scary than its original predecessor.The general feel from the audience was that it was a very enjoyable film (and the morning after I can still feel the palpitations my heart were making last night watching the film)...I would greatly recommend this film for lovers of the original and for people new to The Omen films (although, is there anyone out there who's never seen The Omen - I mean, come on! It's a classic!)...I can quite honestly say that I have never been so thrilled or close to the point of terror as I felt when watching this film - maybe that's just me, though.However, when it comes to films, and especially horror films, I'm usually VERY difficult to please (being more of a theatrical person). But The Omen manages to hit all the right notes for me. It is just so incredible how Moore has managed to bring to the screen this new take on a much loved and respected classic bringing many new additions to it whilst at the same time managing to be very faithful to the original.The only thing that I would suggest is to go and see it with an open mind. In other words don't be thinking it's going to be as good as the original because it simply isn't. There are too many die hard fans of the original commenting on this film saying that it's not that good - well, it was never intended to surpass the original, was it? Surely it was meant as a means to introduce this film to a new audience.However, in it's own right this is a very good try at recreating a film that will haunt you for days and maybe weeks afterwards. And in an age of film where remakes just aren't hitting the spot this is a welcome addition proving that a remake doesn't have to mean an inferior film. It is pretty much on the same par as the original so GO AND SEE IT!!! And let's just hope that they remake the other two, and far inferior, chapters. If they do then I'll be first in line.</fullReview>

The Omen scared the HELLLLLL outta me as a kid and I guess this one might scare some new kids, but let's make some new nightmares rather than rehashing old ones. Anyway,the best part of the WHOLE movie was where they tried to show some scenes foretelling that the apocalypse was soon at hand and they showed the World Trade Center bombing.

		<shortDescription>OMENous re-do almost on the money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of the original, I went into the screening today anticipating being sadly disappointed.Here, in black and white for all to see, I admit it: I was wrong.My original thoughts about this project were that it was almost sacrilege; how could ANYONE remake that film?! How could ANYONE presume to step into a role made famous by Gregory Peck?!Some of my misgivings about the casting were borne out, unfortunately. Julia Stiles, although competent, just isn't mature enough for the role (Katherine). Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick (Damien), though he has a glare that makes your blood cold at times, isn't the best child actor i've seen, and the character comes across as knowing a little TOO well that he knows what he's doing, and what's going on around him. Liev Schreiber (Robert Thorne) appears a little stiff in places, but in others displays a surprising array of emotional depth.Although so much of the film was shot as thought they used the original for storyboards, there were still enough differences and modern upgrades to keep me interested, and a few 'jump in my seat' spots to keep the blood pumping, too! I also have to applaud Mr. Moore for keeping the majority of the out-and-out gore to the necessary minimum (just a few quick dream sequences, plus the all-to-realistic decapitation of Jennings near the end). A good suspense film doesn't have to drip blood off the screen to be scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got done watching the movie, and to tell you the truth, i wasn't expecting much. I know very well what Hollywood tends to do when they attempt to remake a movie. Though I have not seen the original, I would still recommend this movie to anybody as long as they don't scare easily. In my opinion, the best thing about this movie is that it contains many scenes where you know something scary is going to happen and you try to prepare yourself for it, but when it finally does happen, you end up jumping out of your seat. Those scenes were awesome and the scary images only remain on the screen for split seconds so they are not overdone. From what I have read, the plot is almost exactly the same as the original so anybody who has seen it should already know what happens. P.S. - Fans of the "Final Destination" series might want to check this movie out if you know what i mean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit I went into this movie with low expectations, I had heard some bad things about it. There are some good things and bad things about it.Firstly, with all the debates about the casting, I didn't find it too horrible. Julia Stiles seemed out of sorts in the role of Katherine but Liev Schrieber did alright as Robert. Mia Farrow was a bit too sweet as Mrs. Baylock but she pulled it off OK. The rest of the cast was also not bad, nothing special but not horrible.The music was not as good as Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar-winning soundtrack, but then again his soundtrack probably wouldn't have fit this style of filming. I didn't think too much of the jumpy scenes, they seemed designed to do just that and not really add anything to the plot. The dream sequences were just out there.Overall, if this film was judged just on its own it would be a decent change to the type of horror movies we're getting these days, but compared to the original it is inferior in almost every way. Still enjoyed it though, go see it if you get the opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey honey, how does the name Damien sound??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm afraid to say it but here goes ? the horror genre has seen its day. There was a time when films like "Halloween" and "The Exorcist" were taken seriously, before Hollywood threw mindless sequel after sequel at us. One of these movies that helped define the genre was "The Omen", a movie about a child who is the son of the Devil, sent to Earth to start the apocalypse. Released in 1976 "Omen" ranks up there with the best of them as a gripping, unforgettable thriller.Thirty years later (and on June 6th, 2006 I might add) director John Moore (Behind Enemy Lines, Flight of the Phoenix) brings us a remake of said film in an attempt to breath some life back into the genre. This time around we have Leiv Schreiber (The Manchurian Candidate) and Julia Stiles (The Bourne Identity) playing Robert and Katherine Thorn, the loving parents of Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) who may or may not be the son of the Devil. If you're a fan of the original you will be glad to hear that this "Omen" is a very faithful remake, treating the source material with respect and dignity. In fact, if you've seen the original, you'll pretty much know what will happen in every single scene of this film. Still, Moore is able to throw in a good thrill every once in a while to keep you on your toes.The cast and crew have done a respectable job with the film this time around. Leiv does a great job and carries his role well while Seamus is just downright creepy as Damien. The only one that stumbles is Stiles whose acting is a little stiff in some scenes. It was neat to see Mia Farrow ("Rosemary's Baby") in the role of Mrs. Baylock, Damien's creepy nanny. Seeing her was a nice touch and a throwback to the better days of horror.Despite being faithful there are still some differences. The remake modernizes the original, which changes absolutely nothing in regards to plot. Now everyone has a cell phone, digital camera, and a computer instead of a newspaper and one of those ancient land line telephones. This gives it a different feel but it definitely doesn't feel out of place. The story seems to fit in rather well in today's world (as did the original for that matter). The remake does cut down of some of the "cheese factor" that plagued horror films of the 70s but it comes at a price in the form of the pacing. It's not terrible but it does drag in some spots. What make the pacing problems easier to get around are the set designs and the cinematography. The sets are neat and simple without being too bare, the colors are vivid, and the actors fit right in with their surroundings. "Omen" definitely looks nice which is a big improvement over the sometimes drab original.I can say with certainty that you will like this version just as much as you liked the one thirty years ago. But I can't help but wonder if this remake was needed at all. With so little changed it is essentially the same story told thirty years ago but in today's world. "Omen" is very faithful, for better or worse.Bottom Line: Only die-hard fans of the original or those who've never seen it will appreciate this remake.Final Score: 7 out of 10</fullReview>

The cast does a good job but the main thrills come from the cinematography and especially the music. The cast does a good job and casting Schrieber for Thorne makes it a little more believable that he could father the child; Gregory Peck did an excellent job, to be sure, but he always struck me as too old to be a first time father in the original film. That said, I will still recommend the original before this one, but if you're in the mood for a good horror flick in the theatres, this is your best bet.</fullReview>

There was excellent use of cinematography, much better than the old movie, and I actually felt that the music was better in this version than in the first. For example, during the first death in the old movie, there was basically no music present and in the new movie, it was much better. I liked the music and felt it did get an impact. Also, this Omen did a lot better job with the scary points of the movie, as I actually jumped a few times. The deaths were more realistic, though I didn't particularly like one death that the director completely changed from the old movie. Overall, it was an excellent movie and adapted to the modern times quite well, the cinematography was great as was the added score, and it was much more scarier than the original. A good movie for the theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary, but not abominable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As has been said many times, the original Omen relied on being a complete shock and surprise to the audience. We questioned everything we saw and could never predict the next frame. It constantly kept you on edge. This film never achieves the same level of tension because it is essentially a shot by shot remake of the first Omen. We're ten steps ahead of the actors every step of the way. Every time I saw David Thewlis, all I could think was "You're going to be short a head by the end of this film." The new Thorne's are adequate but greatly suffer by comparison to Gregory Peck and Lee Remick. They're too young and just don't have the gravitas of their predecessors. The new Damien is comically evil, which completely eliminates the shock and ambivalence we felt in the original when Thorn actually took steps towards killing him. There's no interior struggle in the audience whatsoever because this kid is obviously evil and needs to die. Mrs. Baylock is played rather hammily by Mia Farrow and becomes an audience favorite instead of the leering, frightening mad dog she was in the original. Her death in the new film is one of the few things that is actually less gory than the original. Which brings me to what this film does right. Unfortunately, all that justifies this film is two deaths: Father Brennan's death is actually a lot more effective in this one than it was in the original and Jennings beheading, though not quite as iconic as it was in the original due in large part to its being expected, is very well done. The film is also very visually lush: there's definitely a far larger budget at work than that of the original. But it's missing the music (which was half of what made the original frightening) and just the overall spirit of the 1978 version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie probably didn't need to be remade, but I did not see the original 1976 Omen. I have, however, seen some of the more recent classic-horror remakes such as Psycho, House of Wax and Dawn of the Dead. With the exception of House of Wax, I thought the others stood up to the originals pretty well - this gave me hope going into the Omen.Robert Thorn (Schreiber) and his wife Kathy (Stiles) lose their baby due to complications at birth. Unbeknownst to Kathy and with the persuasion of a priest, Thorn takes on another child who lost his mother at birth. The Thorns raise Damien as their own (with Kathy believing it is in fact her child). All hell breaks loose at Damien's 5th birthday party and it is eventually revealed to Robert that his child is the anti-Christ! The cast was excellent, with the exception of Damien. He WAS extremely creepy, but director John Moore didn't exploit his eeriness enough as the most frightening parts of the movie come from cheap scares. Schreiber, Stiles and especially Farrow did fantastic jobs. The direction was good as well with the exception of Moore's "signature" shaky camera sequence which are just irritating. I understand the score from the 1976 version won an Academy Award. No such talent here. The score was cliché and mostly forgettable.I left the theater more or less satisfied as it did make me jump a few times (I don't do well at horror movies). Compared to horror movies of late, Emily Rose was much better but The Omen is light years away from the House of Wax.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't really move me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From moving on with the original release 30 years ago I was expecting more from this remake. I was quite disappointed after seeing some of the trailers before seeing the movie that some of trailer scenes weren't included in the final release. ie. 1) The US Ambassador being graphically burnt alive in the back seat of the Iimo 2) Some of Dream Scenes weren't included where by the 1st nanny was screaming in a bright lit room sitting down with a noose around her neck. 3) The High Priest holding Damien up above his head .. The list goes on.I don't understand as to why it was given a MA+15 rating where by it was quite suttle.The acting wasn't bad either, Playing the character of Robert Thorn was pretty big shoes to fill with Gregory Peck playing this role but Levi did it pretty well.My advice, watch it when it is released on DVD</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as i thought it would be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this film was going to be as dreadful as last years horror classic remake "Amityville Horror" but it wasn't. Sometimes Liev Schreiber sounded like Gregory Peck but that's all, i don't think he had the intensity of the mighty Peck but he gave it a good shot. I think the real stars of the movie were Julia Stiles as Kate (i have a soft spot for her so nothing she does disappoints me) and also David Thewlis as David Warners photographer Keith Jennings ( if there ever is a remake of Straw Dogs he would be perfect as Niles) Sadly Mia Farrow didn't do anything for me, she lacked the menace and pure evil of Billie Whitelaw and speaking of evil how could we forget the star of the show Damien, unfortunately i think the director made little Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick try to look the baddest little boy in the world and it never worked for me, bold and evil are two completely different things, Harvey Stephens didn't even try, he was the baddest little boy in the world and that smile at the pre-credits is cinema at its best, something the camera captures and never does again. The ultimate question is why make this, why not just remaster the original, spend millions on it, release it, i like so many would love to have seen this on the silver screen, but sadly i was as young as Harvey was when this was showing across the globe. The thing's i missed the most in this remake were Jerry Goldsmith, the goldfish, Leo Mckern,The Baboons and Giraffes (love the shot of them freaked out by damien) and finally Billie Whitelaw, who scared the hell out of me in the original. So what if the 1976 Omen is dated with flares and 70's haircuts, thats the thing that makes a classic (captures the time), the sheer face of terror on Lee Remick and the score by the wonderful Jerry Goldsmith. So studios more remastering of classics and less with the remakes. I am just going to wrap up now by saying it was not as bad as i thought it would be but will never threaten the classic status of The Omen (1976)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth a remake!?!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very faithful to the original 1976 version, almost to the point of total scenes being exactly the same, just 30 years on. Some good scares, a little slow at times and not the best acting team ever assembled, but overall it was pretty reasonable. The inclusion of modern disasters etc in the real world made the story more cohesive and realistic for todays audience, but the religious significance wasn't as heavily emphasised as the original. Maybe the church isn't cool in the 21st century? Excellent special effects in parts, and Gothic scenery with evil dogs are always a winner. 7/10, lets hope the sequels casting is better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They say that things come along in threes. In the film world, I think that is true. Let's take, for example, three films that created the modern era of the horror genre.Rosemary's Baby The Exorcist The OmenThese films can be viewed today and so much can be said about them, so much that is good, but also, so much that is bad. Let's not forget though just how old these films are.Rosemary's Baby - 37 years old The Exorcist - 33 years old The Omen - 30 years oldThe Omen holds a special place in my heart. It was the first horror film that I watched, I was seven at the time, and it moulded me into the horror watcher and maker that I am today. Of course, it didn't help that I started reading Edgar Allen Poe as a child and my story writing in primary school caused me to pay weekly visit to an educational psychologist.Watching The Omen scared the hell out of me, but it was 1978/79 and there wasn't anything like that on TV, unlike today.I wanted to watch the remake on this special day, the sixth day of the sixth month of the sixth year and I was looking forward to it. I didn't read any of the critics writeups about it, mainly because i rarely agree with what they have to say.I decided that I would write this review with the original film in mind, so this evening, before watching the remake, I sat down and watched the original again, something that I haven't done for well over ten years.There are three things that I look at when making my first decisions about a film:How long before I start thinking about having a fag How long before I notice the aching arse How many people walk out and whether they returnWell, what can i say about the new version? Not much really. It didn't grip me in the same way that the original did this evening. I started thinking about smoking after about twenty minutes, the arse ache took about an hour, even in the luxury seats and people were walking out throughout the entire film, though they did return.It wasn't exactly scary, which is quite important with a horror film, and the main 'jump moments' were dream sequences that weren't in the original and seemed to only be there to be 'jump momemts'. There were moments that gripped you, for a short time, but generally it was just a run-of-the-mill horror.The best actor in the film was Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick, who played Damien aged five, but the rest of the cast were pretty ordinary, no Oscar nominations I'm afraid.To be fair, if this was seen without the original in mind, then it would be quite a good film, but still run-of-the-mill. Also in its favour is having one of the best death scenes that i've seen, nothing fancy, just a great look and feel, though the deaths did seem to have the feel of Final Destination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A marvellous remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I just got back from seeing the new version of The Omen and I can happily say that it is actually just as good as the original.The story is true to the original and knowing what was going to happen next in no way spoilt my enjoyment of the film. There are some great seat jumpers in it and one of them even made me jump from surprise.The movie has a great feel to it, with some fantastic colour and texturing that is brilliantly accentuated by the cinematography. The flow of a distinct colour theme, used to give a prominence of mood and event is masterfully executed, even if it is a bit unsubtle at times.The soundtrack to the movie is very good and further use of sound at key points provides the typical seat jumper moments one should expect. This added to some keenly timed visuals produces optimum effect.The acting was incredibly good, though in some places Julia Stiles seems to be forcing her role a little. But these few moments are easily overlooked by the fact she perfectly recreates the sense of creeping hysteria that her predecessor, Lee Remick, captured magnificently in 1976. The best performance in this film definitely goes to Liev Schreiber in the lead role, with David Thewlis providing excellent support.I had fears Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick, who played the new Damien, wouldn't do well in the role. To be honest, in the trailers he had left something to be desired. But this could have been just the poor shooting of the trailer. I am happy to say, however, that when it came to the actual performance, he didn't disappoint. He maintains a good creepiness, though not so well as the Damien of '76. But with his surrounding cast, he swept through fairly well.A special nod has to be given to Mia Farrow who's return to scary movies is very well received. Her performance is par excellenté and succeeds in summing up her character very nicely. I look forward to seeing more of her again in the future.The plot remains unchanged, though it is interesting to see the prophetical changes that have been made to translate it better to a modern audience. This also provides an interesting undertone between this and the original, regarding the mutability of interpreting prophecy.I feel this film has done well to revive the Omen for those who missed it the first time around. As we all know, the movies of yesteryear aren't as well received my todays movie goers, but The Omen had everyone in the audience jumping.This movie is just as recommend for new comers as it is for fans of the original. A good watch all round.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day Even Damien Cried</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The series that started with the Omen in 1976, is now tarnished yet again by the remake of the namesake film, the Omen( 2006)Much of the same story is here, the child being dead when he is born, the father and mother receiving Damien, the mysterious happenings around his birth, if you want a review of that you can look at my review for the Omen (1976), this however is a far cry from the original, something that I was disappointed by and something that I only own because it came with the first three films.My reasons for disliking this film, as with many who would agree with me are because it is a virtual shot for shot remake, with a few extra scenes shown to clear up some of the story, there is no extra the film is basically the same story with the worst choices for the cast aside from Mia Farrow and Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick who play Damien and Miss Baylock respectively, those two I can say were cast perfectly, Julia Stiles should of never been cast as Mrs Thorn, nor Liev Schreiber never should of played Mr Thorn, these two do not have what it takes to hold with the originals portrayed by Gregory Peck and Lee RemickI was glad to see a remake was done especially when you consider a lot of what has been coming out can be categorized as a gore fest, I mean I don't mind gore but as the original Omen shows you can do a horror film without grotesque amounts of blood, and this movie has that same concept but stumbles upon the acting, most of it feels forced if not dry, Stiles can't even pull off crying that well when she tells him that she needs help that she is starting to fear that Damien is evil. I will give the production value a plus, even the color palliate was a good choice the reds and whites, but all in all because of the acting this film is just not as good or even near the original, nor can I think of any actors that can go toe to toe with the original cast, it was a flawed attempt to bring something that needs to be brought back, back. I can't even finish the movie without wanting to claw my eyes out in shame</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Omen 2006-Enough With the Brat Already *1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1976 film was enough for me. "The Omen" has had several sequels. Why did they bother to make this film over again?At least, the original had Gregory Peck and Lee Remick who brought some radiance to their doomed roles. In this version, Liev Schrieber and Julia Stiles are terribly miscast. Their chemistry is non-existent even before that little monster shows up to ruin their lives.Mia Farrow, as that evil nanny, has some good moments but even she is no match to Billie Whitelaw who starred in the original. Whatever became of Whitelaw? She was the embodiment of evil with those large eyes. Farrow, on the other hand, acts like she is in "Rosemary's Baby" and is trying to emulate co-star, the Oscar winner, Ruth Gordon. Ms. Farrow, a Minnie Castevet, you're not!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. I have no idea why people hate it that much. In the old one (spoiler) when the priest is about to be stabbed by the pole, he goes "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH" for like 10 seconds. In the new one (I'm a high tech lover)the priest looks up, and in that second, he gets stabbed. Much more realistic. And in the old one, the priest limps unrealistically to one side. In the new one,the body goes straight down with the pole. Also, there is a problem with the hanging, because in one scene, the kids are just staring at Chesa's body. In the new one, there is mass confusion. The only darn reason I am giving this a nine is that Damien doesn't (kind of) talk at all. I know the filmmakers wanted to do that, but I still think he should talk a bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This surprisingly updated remake is good but doesn't beat the original 1976 classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Diplomat Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber) finds out that his child died at birth. But his wife (Julia Stiles) doesn't know about her recently deceased baby. When an mysterious priest (Giovanni Lombardo Radice) advices Robert to adopt a new born baby, instead of telling the truth to his wife. When he decides to adopt the baby, it brings joy to his wife. But when Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) turns six on his birthday. His nanny committed suicide, then a series of grotesque murders and accidents happens. Robert decides to investigate trying to find Damien's parents with the help of a photographer (David Thewlis). But the two find things that are inexplicable and Damien isn't what he seems to be.Directed by John Moore (Behind Enemy Lines, Flight of the Phoenix "2004") made an reasonable remake on the 1976 classic. Which this remake is certainly unnecessary but it's made for finding a new generations of movie audiences today. The remake is fairly faithful with good performances, especially by Thewlis and Mia Farrow as the Sinister New Nanny. There's some changes to the story-line like making Robert and his wife an younger couple comparing to the middle age couple in the original, the death sequences are somewhat different and some key moments are changed as well.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes an interesting commentary track by the filmmakers, deleted gory key sequences that should have been stayed in the final cut, a documentary and two featurettes. This remake received mixed reviews, it was modest hit at the box office and Die Hard fans of the original has mixed feelings of the remake. It is flawed, it lacks scares and Fitzpatrick isn't effective as Damien. Which the original "Damien", Harvey Stephens appears briefly as a photographer. This new version has some (unintentionally ?) hilarious dialogue too. Still, the remake is a nice try and it is certainly better than recent horror remakes like "The Hitcher" and "When a Stranger Calls". Although David Seltzer, who credited with the remake. Seltzer had nothing to do with the new take, since he wrote the original. (*** 1/2 out of *****).</fullReview>

You don't know anything about her2. You see she gets along very well with you mentally twisted sun3. She makes you a surprise and brings a dog inside the house without notifying you- What was the use of all the trip to Italy? ... in the end he needed to do just what the priest from under the bridge in London told him to to- Why hurrying and breaking your own gate when everything could have been done smoothly. Get out slowly with the car from your yard without getting followed by cops.- Getting killed by cops in the end? How lame is that? ... Making a movie about Satan and make the main character die shot by cops in the church.- Since when are presidents nannies for a lonely ambassador child?Cheap thought scenario, a little amateur style too.

Once it started however I was in for an exciting edge of my seat thriller. What is crazy is the fact that you know all the big events that are going to happen, but there are many scenes that still grab you and won't let go. This movie also did for me what a horror movie or suspense movie has not done in years. It took me by surprise. I must admit it got at least one jump out of me perhaps two. With it's wonderful acting, eerie cinematography and brilliant musical score I will say this is a light at the end of the so far blasé summer movie tunnel. If they keep on with the series I only hope they are as good as this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, when it comes to remakes, directors just can't win. When the change one little thing, fans of the original go nuts. Yet when they fail to make those changes, fans still go nuts and state there wasn't a reason to make a remake, because they didn't change anything. Honestly, in the venue of contemporary remakes, Hollywood just can't win. But let me tell you now...This IS a faithful and effective remake.As far as this movie goes, it was far above par and highly exceeded my personal expectations where it was concerned. I have to say that Liev Shreiber is no Robert Mitchem, but he was well above adequate as Damien's Father. Mia Farrow is a darkling joy, and Sir Michael Gambon turns in a brilliant performance. Frankly, Mia and Gambon were the only reasons I bothered with seeing a remake of this worn out old gas station dog of a franchise in the theaters. Otherwise, I would have waited for the extended edition DVD release. This line (if you don't already know, crawl out from beneath your rock!) is based on the Mark of the Beast of biblical myth. I am genuinely tired of the Christian heresy angle. I would much rather see something based on the older systems. But that is neither here, nor there.If you're a fan of the franchise, you won't be disappointed. The action is well paced, the effects are NEVER over the top, and the performances are astounding. That's all I have to say.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend:.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First things first, i'm a huge fan of the horror genre. I love these kind of movies from Predator to Ringu, from The eye to Alien. I've seen the original Omen. And I know that the original considered as a classic horror picture, for me it was a mediocre movie. I liked the story and i felt that it has a potential to be a better movie.Last week my girlfriend, she's family and I bought tickets to the new Omen. My expectations were not too high, because I've seen the trailer and that made me think that the new is just another remake with nothing really revolutionary. And I was right.I mean the crowd screamed three times, that's all. But I'm nervous about these clichés. Today's horrors (the bad ones) are full of scary moments but I think it's tiring to watch over and over again.The one of the most annoying things for me was Liev Schreiber's character. He plays an ambassador in this and he is so stupid. He doesn't get the picture - besides the lot of proof which he knows and reveals - till the very end of the movie. He just asks "what, who???" all the time. The photographer's and the priest's character was good.At the end of my comment I suppose to say that if you've already seen the original, then there's no reason to pay for this. If you know the story and want to know how to ruin it, then watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of celluloid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1976 The Omen was released. In this film a couple of events heralded the birth of the anti-Christ. A humanoid looking kid that would be the son of the Devil. The kid would bear the number of the beast, a birthmark in the shape of three sixes, somewhere on the body. The kid would have to be killed, or great Evil would be set free on this Earth once again.The original Omen film was good for its time - the story was the start for what turned out to be a threesome of films - one featuring evil as a young kid, the second one featuring him as an adolescent, the third one with him as a grown up man. Each film hence representing a part out of the life of the Antichrist, on the rise to power. The series started good with part 1 and gradually grew worse: the second being OK, the third being bad. But.. Back to current time.The Omen (2006) is an almost shot-for-shot remake of the original one. Featuring a lot of the events as they happened in the original, having only a few minor changes. Sadly, none of the shots were better than the original. On the contrary, the most of them were worse. A lot worse. This film seems to be not quite finished, or rush-finished to meet a deadline. It just isn't complete.Not good at all. This remake has nothing that speaks for it. It's a complete waste of perfectly good celluloid and I'd urge anyone remotely interested in seeing this one to skip it and rent the original one from the videostore instead.1 out of 10 bad omens.</fullReview>

And according to minimum wage, i'm going to say this movie takes up about 3 and half hours of your existence. Maybe you want to add in the time it took you to get to the theatre, the time it took you to put on your clothes, your shoes, to look up the show times, we should probably throw in gas price too.This is the longest, slowest movie i've ever seen, once it started i started asking myself when it would be over. were i having sex with the movie, i would have faked it just to get it off me. Actually, i take that back, i don't have enough compassion for this movie to even spare it the shame of having not pleasured me at all. AT ALL, in actuality, i would have kicked it out of bed, and taken 30 bucks for wasting my time.Watching this movie was like watching a magic show where someone cuts a woman in half, in a glass box. Not to compare this movie to any sort of magic, unless its really crappy magic like that geek with the glasses over on Robson trying to do street magic i've seen out of those svengali boxes you get from the mall. There are no surprises, no build up, the only anticipation i had was for this god forsaken movie to end.And it made no sense. *SPOILER. just a fair warning* At one point, the priest, running away from the devil, tried to get himself into the church, and the door inside the church locked from the inside? wtf. thats not Satan's home. Why would he be seeking refuge inside god's crib if the devil had the keys? MAKE NO SENSE.It is a horrible movie where you just wished everyone died. and that that comet would come back and hit the earth and get Armageddon over with. asap.My brain has already started to purge the contents of this movie... IT is now gone. Thank God. Don't WATCH IT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>do you really want to know why the movie was terrible?to me it had no point towards the moral of the story.wow! the dad was trying to kill his son and he was stupid too he should've just stabbed the son when he had the chance to but no he let the cop shoot him and th mom had said in the beginning that the interviews for a new nanny were over n another lady was there for one she should've said sorry but i'm very tired and interviews are already over but no she wants to be the idiot and go to let her in.the ending was sort of funny because of the way the little boy was looking at the screen that's why and everuone started to laugh.but i can't see why people enjoyed the movie so much i'm sorry but to me if you watched that movie you can't call yourself a Christian which i don't know just forget it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>666 the dark day. Once a century do those number appear as a date on the calender. yes! and what do we get for all that dark energy? The Omen Remake-- a new dreadful type of evil that strikes the horror fan at his weakness, His/Her love and respect of the influential groundbreaking horror movies.This movie provides two hours of mediocre entertainment of supernatural blah blah blah. It is not scary. Better horror has come out in the last few years people. Go see Hostel, or High Tension, or take a chance on an older horror movie like Session 9, or Ginger Snaps if you want character driven horror. As far as remakes go, not one in the last 15 years has matched the entertainment of the original, even though one or two of them may have been scary. The Night Of The Dead Remake was the last horror remake to take an old screenplay and really breathe some creativity into it.TOR is not so much a remake, but a polished copy with the same screenplay! Gregory Peck is still the man, and Leiv Schrieber cries too much! It is all how you remember it but all with a weird cast of more familiar faces from recent movies. Kind of like asking your girlfriend to try on an outfit of your ex-girlfriends; its never a good fit and it is likely to cost you a good relationship. I'm sorry, (Insert name of Remake here) but it's not working out, so I am not going to see you anymore.All you zombies do not show your faces and spawn of Satan celebrate in hell (where the party's at anyway) because if you go see The Omen Remake than the Exorcist remake with Dakota Fanning as Regan is not far behind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>a good-hearted comedy that includes some minor family problems. but by the end, they get passed their minor Shenanigans and everything goes back the way it was.oh yeah. i almost forgot. this movie was terrible. it was not scary at all. some parts made you jump yeah but after you jumped you'd say to yourself something like "god that was stupid". i heard a lot of laughter and chuckles in parts where they were "fake crying" and going through emotional anguish.. i like hearing about heaven, hell, the anti-Christ and all that religious damnation stuff. but in this movie it just wasn't attached to the movie that well. i did like watching the air bubble going into the I.V. though. that part creeped me out a bit... you can like the movie if you want, its up to you. but i just didn't like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>repeated boom in the shot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fire the boom operators...fire the editors. This film was an absolute farce. The reason people were laughing during otherwise "serious" scenes was that the boom was very visible in almost every indoor scene including some of the closeups.In one scene, not only was the tip of the microphone visible but the entire boom and wiring was at the top of the shot. It's the scene where Mom reprimands the nanny for not having Damien dressed and ready. The boom is above Mia Farrow's head as she looks over the railing.People were mocking this repeated mistake as it occurred more often. The best "boom mock" line was spoken by a fellow theater patron just as Mom fell over the railing. He yelled "Grab onto the boom Julia!" That's not really a spoiler because it happened in the first film as well but I checked the spoiler box anyway.Wait for the DVD. Maybe they'll edit it out or something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not up to the level of the original one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to make a few comments only since a lot of viewers have been very informative about this film.This re-make falls short of my expectations since I'm an avid horror film fan and in particular of the excellent original one with Gregory Peck ,who also happens to be one of my most favourite actors of all time.To begin with,the cast are not very much into their roles.Perhaps because they aren't the right choice.Their expressions of their feelings were shallow and unconvincing.Only Stiles went near,but still I think she is miscast for her role,talented though she may be.Her looks,her face,her style,are just not compatible for a woman who would be the wife of the ambassador of the United States.She is too youngish and sweet,not sophisticated,not the ambitious type she should look.Liev Schreiber is too unemotional,he tries but seems somehow he can't put himself deep into this role.His most interesting scenes are when there is some action.Unfortunately he also doesn't fit the profile of an American ambassador.A politician is more complex,more elaborate,more stylish if you want.Just like Gregory Peck was when he played the part.Apart from talent,you also have to look the part.And these people didn't.Mia Farrow is a top notch ,very experienced performer who was very good in her role,and although I admire her a lot,I think Mrs.Baylock of the old gem,was far more frightening and convincing as a sinister nanny,an apostate of the devil,than Mia.Mia is too sweet and a very aristocratic and beautiful woman to be cast in this kind of role.To make a final comment.If you want to see this film at the best it has to offer because it is a powerful film with a very interesting and popular theme find and rent the old one made I think in 1978.Not only Gregory Peck but all the rest of the cast were excellent in their roles,and the original film is a gem. But if you can't find it near you or are bored to search or just want to kill a boring night with a few friends,go see it.It's not a bad film,and it has a strong plot.It only happens to be a little more than average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth Watching, for All the Wrong Reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought into the hype, and went and saw this on 6-06-06. I have to admit, I really enjoyed it, but that's only because it was HILARIOUS. If it'd had some references to bodily functions it would've been Scary Movie 5. The acting was two-dimensional, the flashes of 'scary' imagery were more comedic than startling (be sure and keep an eye out for the costume I could swear the pilfered from M. Night Shyamalan's prop closet), and the gore that I assume was supposed to be disturbing was so exaggerated and ridiculous I couldn't help but laugh. I have _never_ seen a horror movie this unintentionally funny that wasn't some crappy B movie (a la "Cheerleader Massacre"). If you haven't seen it yet, and missed getting your 6/06/06 ticket stub, I wouldn't bother paying $30 for tickets and popcorn to go see it - but when it's on pay-per-view for $3.95 and you need a good laugh - The Omen, all the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We are horror movie fans and love the original The Omen. I'd read some bad reviews and was a little wary going in, but we loved the remake! There was so much more plot and character development in the remake, and it filled in many gaps that the original had. I loved that it kept with the plot/characters of the original, and many of the camera angles and shots. But the best part is, director John Moore uses updated camera technology to really get in close to the characters and scenes. Moore creates beautifully composed shots of Rome and Great Britain, incredible sets, and greatly improves on original shots such as the "impalement" scene. The methods of death changed, but only for the better. Great acting by Julia Stiles, Liev Schrieber, and Mia Farrow. The casting director should be congratulated for recruiting Farrow, but Stiles, on the other hand, shouldn't have been chosen to play Damien's mother. She did well, but looks way too young for this part, originally played by Lee Remick, who was in her 40s when she acted as Katherine Thorn. I think traditionalists will enjoy the expanded plot and additions and new viewers will be just plain scared. Go see this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barely a summary - just a few thoughts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never in life can a bad word be said about Liev Schreiber's acting. To tell you the truth, the film has often been on cable the past few months and tonight was actually the first night that I was in bed being able to enjoy the movie in its entirety. However, I must say that I do not know much about Julia Styles, either on a personal or professional level. I think this was the one movie that I've actually seen her act! (Sorry Julia) The pairing of the two as a loving couple was more horrifying than some of the scenes! In my opinion, the movies seemed to be in halves. Something with the coloration. I guess High Definition TVs do make a difference. After his wife died, I saw Robert in a different light---both metaphorically, as well as, literally. Once he arrives in Rome, the darkness and beyond comes into play. I saw his facial angles in such a way where he was a timeless classic. Even charming at some points of a thriller! The bond between he and his son, Seamus Davey Fitzpatrick, was somewhat touching more so tonight possibly since he has just been given a son. Holding Damian, in the film, brought a quick pic of his character in A Walk on the Moon where he grabs his son, lifts him up, and hugs him. What a wonder! oh- absolutely can not forget to give recognition for the well-spoken Italian in that voice so many admire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the acting was great on all parts and the directing was awesome. I don't think they could have done a better job remaking this film. I actually like the new version better than the old witch is usually not the "norm." I agree as well about there not being any graphically altered scenes. That, to me, ruins the moment because it is not a realistic view. I think this is why the older horror movies always seem much creepier and scary, they had to keep it real without the new technology we have today. I really hope they do all the sequels with this movie, of course with the same directors. I will defiantly add this to my movie collection. ;}</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK,this is my honest take having seen all of the original omen's and yes I did love all of them.I just barely saw this version,even though I do love the originals and always will.I can't help but say the new Omen is just as good as the original if not better.The actors do a very good job of portraying their character,which is exactly what an actor is supposed to be able to do.The special affects are amazing,which is what they are supposed to be these days.And the plot makes a good couple of hours of horror enjoyment.I think too many people are worried about preserving the original,which I have always loved and will continue to.But I know people who never saw the original,but saw the new one and absolutely loved it.It is an extremely good horror movie compared to most of the crap they put out these days.And personally as for me,right now I am heading out to purchase a copy of this movie.And by the way I was skeptical of this movie at first,but said the heck with it and rented it,so anyone doubting this movie,believe me it's worth your money.No matter what any die hard original omen fan tries to tell you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Effective, creepy, stressful and atmospheric remake of Richard Donner's classic of 1976. Most of the age know the storyline as a young child (feature debut for Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick as Damien) is really the son of Satan, born not of a woman but of a jackal. An American official (Liev Schreiber) takes the child in as his own (never telling wife Julia Stiles the boy is not their true birth-child) after his real son dies at birth. Something seems off as the child ages and slowly strange occurrences and deaths take place. Mia Farrow (looking as good as ever) is well-placed as Damien's protector and established character actors Pete Postlethwaite, David Thewlis and Michael Gambon are perfectly cast as individuals who begin to learn what is really going on as the film advances to its staggering finale. Undertones aplenty here in the remake as we have an effective translation into present-day times with natural disasters and clear explanations of the Book of Revelations via the Vatican and the Catholic faith. Though a slight rethinking of the original, there are plenty of variations found within to make the feature fresh and innovative. Surprisingly successful. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>even though I'm only 15, i am a fan of the 76 Omen. i had been waiting to see this version since last year. Don't believe all the people on this website because they hate everything and make people hate everything with them. in this movie the Damien kid is a cute little boy with some scary looks to him also. there were a few scream/jump up in chair scenes and even 30old men freaked out in thoese scenes. also the casting of the nanny was really good. she freaks me out and this why I'm not getting a nanny for kids when i have them. i also the how they added real life events again from the last 5yrs. the added 9/11 stuff,Katrina stuff,tsunami(sp?)stuff,and things like the war and things. also i don't know when this was made but the pope in the beginning looked like pope john Paul the 2ed and that the end they saw the pope dying. the part that scared me the most in the original was the smile at the very end. it gave me nightmares when i watch it. so when i watch this one the smile still freaked me out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Worthy Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a movie that is met with mixed opinions all ranging from, "Why remake a classic?" to "Modernizing it will make it scarier." I myself had doubts about a remake but after viewing the movie and giving it a fair chance I have come to terms with it. The Omen is a faithful remake that packs more scares than the original. The remake however lacks the haunting score that made the original all most unbearable to view. The acting in The Omen (2006) is superb. Julie Stiles gives a mature performance that will no doubt open doors for her. Newcomer Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick is creepy as Damien and follows in the footsteps of original Damien, Stephen Harvey,all most to the T. But the stand out is Liev Schreiber who portrays Robert Thorn perfectly without mirroring Gregory Pecks performance in the original. So if your looking for a movie that is bound to make you jump and sometimes yell out then you need look no further than The Omen, I guarantee you'll leave satisfied and, dare I say, a little more hesitant to brush your teeth or take a bath. You'll see what I mean. Enjoy!</fullReview>

There are some really good parts where the whole theater was jumping out of their seats.

		<fullReview>1. Money does not buy happiness, particularly when you are raising the Devil's son.2. Do not take a random child from someone who is trying to replace your dead son.3. Julia Stiles does not gain weight when she is pregnant.4. Watch out for Final Destination 4: The Omen. Seriously... could it be more similar? 5. Gorillas hate the devil.6. Having The Devil Wears Prada as a movie preview to The Omen is not really thought out well.7. Make sure you call Rome, Italy to see if your destination still exists before you fly out there on government money to find the hospital you are looking for burned down.8. Apparently, all black dogs are evil.9. Buying a giant, creepy house in a movie is never a good idea.10. Decapitation deserves an applause from the general public movie-goers.11. There is no appropriate response to finding out your child's mother was a jackal.12. Make sure to interview your nanny very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent but somewhat inferior remake of a classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen starts in Rome as Katherine Thorn (Julia Stiles) the wife of Deputy US Ambassador Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber) gives birth, however Robert is informed that the newborn baby has died &amp; that they are willing to substitute another baby whose mother has died which Robert agrees to. Several years later &amp; Robert's boss the US Ambassador Steven Haines dies in a tragic accident &amp; Robert inherits his job, Robert is then placed as the US Ambassdor to Britain &amp; moves there with his wife Katherine &amp; young son Damien. At first all goes well but after their nanny hangs herself things go from bad to worse as an old priest (Pete Postlethwaite) warns Robert that Damien is the son of the Devil &amp; that he is in danger, as more people die under mysterious circumstances &amp; the things the priest said start to make more &amp; more sense Robert has to accept that he must kill his own son but the forces of darkness are at work &amp; it won't be as easy as that...Directed by John Moore this Hollywood remake of the classic demonic horror film The Omen (1976) follows a long line of recent horror remakes including The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), The Fog (2005), The Hills Have Eyes (2006) &amp; Halloween (2007) to name but four &amp; while some may have an intense dislike of remake by their very nature I don't have a problem with them as the original films still exist anyway. Here with The Omen the makers have hired David Seltzer to write the script who actually wrote the original way back in the 70's although the original director Richard Donner wasn't invited back, to be honest Seltzer doesn't stray too far away from his original script &amp; this remake follows the original very closely &amp; sometimes even word for word. All of the major incidents &amp; plot points are here, from the death's to Damien's birthmark to the priest who tries to warn Robert to Katherines fall to the switching of babies to the evil dogs to the sinister nanny to the exact same ending as Damien appears to have been adopted by the US President. To be fair The Omen makes for a decent enough horror thriller with political overtones (it's implied that politicians are the real Satan &amp; that they are the real evil in our society rather than ancient belief's) that isn't too deep but does have enough dramatic moments to lift it above the usual one tone teen slashers. At almost two hours long it does drag a little at times but there's just about enough going on to sustain ones attention &amp; interest, overall &amp; good effort that isn't amazing or even as good as the original but worth watching especially if you haven't seen the original &amp; don't fancy watching a film 25 years old (which I know some don't).In a neat publicity move the film was released on 06/06/06 &amp; one has to wonder whether part of the reason this was ever made was for that unique marketing gimmick. Apparently director Moore used the colour red to signify danger although I must admit I didn't really notice it myself. There's a few gory moments, someone is impaled &amp; there's a really cool decapitation &amp; the set-pieces are predictably bigger than the originals with CGI &amp; more scale. There's a nice visual style here too, there's some stylish &amp; striking sets &amp; the film looks nice throughout but that can lead to it looking a bit staged at times.With a supposed budget of about $25,000,000 this wasn't a mega budget production, I think it could be described as modest. Shot largely in Prague in the Czech Republic with some filming in Dublin &amp; Italy &amp; even though this is set in Britain you can see the odd sign written in Czech. Apparently Pierce Brosnan &amp; Jim Carey were considered for the role of Robert while Rachel Weisz turned the part of Katherine down because she was pregnant. Harvey Stephens who played Damien in the 1976 original has a small cameo as a newspaper reporter while the atmospheric teaser trailer was actually Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick's screen test.The Omen is a fine remake of a classic horror film, it follows the original very closely &amp; anyone familiar with the original will have a strong feeling of déj? vu, for those of you that haven't seen the original this is worth a watch as it's slightly better than average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie really is awesome. It had me on the edge of my seat and I didn't want it to end! Normally I critic movies very harshly and this was just incredible! It followed the story of the 70s Omen very closely but it was very interesting. As a horror/thriller buff I don't normally jump out of my seat, I laugh. But this one had me jump a foot in the air! Very very interesting. I loved this movie. 10 out of 10!! &lt;3 This movie had to do a lot with the Vatican and about the Roman Empire. I feel that when they mentioned the Roman Empire and the birth of the Anti-Christ, I believed that they were going to mention Emperor Nero, who was in fact the first Anti-Christ as believed by the Vatican. During a scene in the beginning of the movie, a gas truck crashed in Rome and covered the street with gas. A cigarette was thrown out and a fire started. Emperor Nero started a fire in Rome in 64 AD in the Circus Maximus which is very close to the Colesium (which was not up in the time that the fire that Nero started burned Rome) which is where the gas fire started in the movie. I hope you find this review useful in your choice of viewing The Omen (2006)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad At All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not every day when one man tries to save the world by stabbing the son of the devil with a sacred dagger on an altar of God, even if he is the U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain. Especially when he agrees to substitute this child with his own that gets murdered in a conspiracy of devils, and doesn't even try to get help from his wealthy family or anyone official. He knows he screwed up, and he takes the burden of trying to save mankind from the folly of his own ways.What bothered me is the many many people who kept claiming that this was a shot for shot remake, and it was a lie. While some elements of the 1976 original remain intact to pay homage to the writer and the work of those involved, it is not the same movie. There are changes to the story to make it more like today, and you get the sense that if you didn't know any better you would swear that it was actually real and not a movie. Horror movies are usually all fantasy, blood, guts, and gore. This one reels you in, makes you think and feel, and it won't let you go.Unfortunately, the Thorns had zero chemistry. No question. They are married but they act like old pals who have lost that special magic, and that doesn't hold a candle to Gregory Peck and Lee Remick. Neither one of them have any chemistry to Damien either. It's like the lights were on, but no one is home. It reminds me of one of those mediocre school plays from yesteryear where everyone does their part perfectly, but there is no passion and no feeling. In the movie, a lot of bad things are happening but no one cares. This from the one man who thinks he is going to save us all from little Damien and his real Daddy.Besides the poor acting from the main characters, I did enjoy Mia Farrow who played Mrs. Baylock. She stood way out, and looked like she had fun doing it.The rest of the movie was outstanding. If you are looking for a great story and you need a good scare at the same time, this one is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Worthy Remake- Casual Horror Fans Won't Be Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just went to go see this movie, and being a fan of the original, I didn't have high expectations. It seems that Hollywood has been spewing out nothing but bogus remakes and sequels as of late, which is really disappointing.But by the time I had walked out, I was pleasantly surprised, as were many of the other audience members. While I still liked the old one better, this one was very powerful. The acting was good, the audio was great, and the atmosphere was very foreboding and excellent. Some of the death scenes were even redone (for example, the death of Mrs. Baylock is simply genius now, and I can't tell you how many oohs and ahs, as well as "Oh my God"'s, there were at her death). The graphics and acting don't feel over-the-top at all, and they suit the movie very well.Overall, I would suggest this movie to any casual movie-goer, whether or not you saw the original. It is well worth the $5.95 that I paid to go see it, and the chills you get from this movie will stay with you for a while.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Got to see the Omen at a free preview last night at midnight, the dawn of 06/06/06. The key word is FREE, I am very glad I didn't have to spend my own money to see it. I'm hoping that our reel was a fluke but I'd have expected more from a major production, but I'm afraid it's the one they'll be showing beginning today. There were boom mikes visible in many scenes (the entire theater erupted in laughter every time they dropped into the shot), studio lighting was visible, and there were some continuity/location issues. It was impossible to maintain willing suspension of disbelief with so many distractions. Again I hope the preview I saw last night was a fluke reel, I just expected better production value for a major film, especially a remake that should be slicker than the original. The acting was fine, Mia Farrow was probably the most effective in her role, and most of the actors did a decent job. The deaths though feeling heavily foreshadowed and staged were probably one of the highlights of the movie. The part the audience enjoyed the most was Mia Farrow's nanny getting kicked in the chops and then hit with the car, one of the few parts where everyone finally got into the movie. Again, I hope ours was a fluke, but beware the boom mikes of death from above!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't awful in the production style and was to be expected for a Hollywood type movie. BUT, what was horrifically bad about it was that it completely frustrated the audience. The boy needed to get a swift kick in the pants and a lot of it was over-done and cliché. The characters and plot device was over-glorified and not needed. I hated it and left me with and empty and unjust feeling. I am reminded to not see the sequels when they are released. POOR. I give it an F+, only for the creepy and gore factor. Otherwise it deserved and F-. I advise that it shouldn't be watched, UNLESS you want to kick children in the nuts after leaving the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally A Remake Worth Watching.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two inherent problems with most remakes nowadays. They are either unnecessary as the original is a classic that stands out on it's own merit and/or the remake is so bad it makes you wonder why they bothered remaking it in the first place. Although I would characterize "The Omen" as a classic that didn't need to be remade the remake of this classic horror movie is surprisingly well done. It stays true enough to the original film so the die-hards really don't have anything to complain about and adds enough tweaks to bring the story up to date with current times. The new opening sequence was a nice addition and some of the "accidents" are gorier than in the original film. Unlike the recent "Amityville Horror" remake this film stays true to the original. I can honestly say that I am looking forward to the eventual remakes of Damien: Omen II (1978) and The Final Conflict (1981) I just hope that someone has the sense to remake the ending of The Final Conflict a lot better than the original which was a disappointing dud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nifty Horror Remake of the 1976 Richard Donner Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen is the most faithful recreation of a horror film since Gus Van Sant's much maligned Psycho back in 1998. And like Van Sant's film, it received a surprising percentage of bad reviews for what is essentially the same great movie Donner made 30 years earlier. There is a double standard here I do not understand. The son of the devil is adopted into the lives of a power-couple and soon anyone who suspects his demonic nature dies horribly as dark forces gather and conspire to ensure the child inherits the Thorn empire. Mia Farrow who as Rosemary had a child you wouldn't want to invite over for play dates co-stars as Damien's sinister nanny; Mrs. Blaylock. The Omen succeeds because it's a terrific story and the cast is up to the challenge. It doesn't depend on roller-coaster paced special visual effects or graphic gore for scares. It's not as fine a film as the original but it's pretty good and well worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Erratic and Derivative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There really isn't nothing really new in this updated version of the original movie released twenty years earlier and it doesn't seem much as changed in that time except perhaps for cell phones. Mia Farrow as the nanny is under-utilized and both Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles are somewhat restrained by a more unbelievable script. The editing, especially in the beginning makes for an uneven and sometimes erratic presentation. Damien himself isn't offered much in the way of lines that exude either fear or tender love (particularly as it might have been important in the ending scenes). The movie is derivative and doesn't really add much to the original movie, raising the question why having shot in the first place and just allow those who have never seen the original, just to experience a re-release and save the cost of the updated version. There is a few scenes between Schrieber and Stiles early on that attempt to portray some death of character and relational substance, but it doesn't go on for long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some movies should be left untouched. This isn't a terrible movie but isn't as good as the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake to the 1976 film The omen, isn't as good. You know why? Because, like the Psycho remkae,there is only one or two differences in the remake than the original. In a remake, I know you have to stay true to the roiginal film, but I want some differences. At least in Rob Zombie's Halloween(Which really blew)there was something different. In The Omen, there isn't much.We have seen this film before. Literally, back in 1976. The remake stars Liev Schrieber and Julia Stiles as The Thorns, the couple who adopts that evil bastard Damien. The main problem I had with the remake is that I knew what was coming. I loved the original film but this movie I didn't. It's not a total disaster but it's not a success. I don't understand myself sometimes. I give a remake without much originality a thumbs down. In a remake I want something new. But I gave another remake with some originality a thumbs down also. Do you know what this means? They should stop remaking great horror film. Thumbs down for The Omen. Occasionally made me jump but not all that much there.The Omen:**1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needless, but surprisingly solid update of the classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nowadays it seems like every film that left a mark on the world and was a hit at the time it was released is being remade for the current generation. The problem is that in some cases the sole purpose for doing so seems to be making lots of money. The first, though not the first period, major remake was 1998s new version of 'Psycho.' But instead of an interesting new spin on the original story, what we got was a shot-for-shot, word-for-word retread of the classic set in the present. What is the point of that I ask? Fortunately director Gus Van Sant has proved his worth since then with films like 'Elephant' and 'Milk.' The ones that have come since turned out to be less a remake and more a reinvention of the original stories. 30 years after the original's release, 20th Century Fox unleashed a modern version of their hit 'The Omen' and unfortunately like that remake of Alfred Hitchcock's film there wasn't much different between this film and it's original. However, some of the differences there are and the talent in front of and behind the camera mostly make up for that and make this new 'Omen' film much better than some other horror remakes and than it deserves to be.Pros: Good work by Liev Schrieber and the supporting cast. Beautifully photographed. After a slow start this film moves at an effortless pace. A good score, which includes a decent new version of the original theme. Exquisite architecture. Awesome death scenes/set pieces. Some of the changes and new additions to the script are welcome. Like the original, this film has a dread-filled gloomy tone. Some good scares.Cons: If you've seen the original you'll find few surprises here. The talented Julia Stiles is woefully miscast here. I'll give her this though, she does get better as the film goes along. The dream sequences, which I'm sure were meant to be scary, are silly and stick out like a sore thumb. The actor playing the new Damien does fine, but unlike the original's young star he's too obviously evil.Final thoughts: Granted this update of 'The Omen' isn't as effective as the original and it really doesn't add much new to the proceedings, it's still a very well done film on most fronts. Just don't compare it to the original, which it pales in comparison to. On it's own it is quite good and definitely far better than the ill-conceived 'Omen IV: The Awakening.' My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this update. I could barely get through the original, as I despise the 70's and don't like any of the actors in that version, and that almost made me not watch this one. However, as the cast had plenty of actors that I've enjoyed in other things, I decided to give it a chance and was pleasantly surprised.If you loved the original, there's probably not much reason for you to see this one. It's almost a shot-for-shot remake, though it does have some variations here and there.If you're like me and you can't stand the original because of the setting in the 70's or the cast, you might want to give this one a try. And it's worth watching if you're a fan of Liev Schreiber, David Thewlis, Pete Postlethwaite, Julia Stiles or Mia Farrow.</fullReview>

The only thing I don't like about the movie is a few sounds and music which is the reason for my nightmares. I watched the movie over five times and I never stop watching it. My favorite part in the movie is when Robert Thorn had to battle Mrs Baylock. Because Mrs Baylock make a lot funny noises when she and Robert Thorn fought. My least favorite part in the movie is when Robert Thorn got shot by secret service agents in the church for trying to stab Damian Thorn. But the good part of that was that the omen trilogy did not end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>--&gt; MINOR SPOILERS The only good things about this film were: Liev Schreiber, David Thewlis and Pete Postlethwaite. Fine actors.Bad things: Julia Stiles is a beautiful and talented actress, but her acting was stiff and her lines were as if she read them straight from the script. This might also be the director's fault.What also bothered me was the fact that Damien was constantly mysterious and demonic. At least the original and the sequel had 'normal' moments. Damien was a normal young kid with friends which made the scary moments more exciting and unpredictable.The story went to fast. No build up. Stiles immediately suggested that Damien was evil. Any normal person would have thought her son was 'special' or 'emotionally handicapped' but not in this film.Overall bad acting, bad build up, bad directing, bad story. As if the makers only took a few good moments from the original and left the rest empty.Thankfully Schreiber and Thewlis are 2 very charismatic actors and they saved this movie with some very convincing and credible moments from receiving a lower rating than 4.</fullReview>

Julia Stiles and Liev Schrieber ( who are not parents ) acted very well. They had a lot of depth to both of their characters and both characters share the lead role.Damien is their adopted son but Kate ( Stiles) doesn't know that. AS he grows he starts to become a concern as everything bizarre starts to happen. Robert ( schrieber) is an ambassador who lives in The Uk with his wife and damien. When they hire a nanny things go haywire. Damien plans to kill them both but its too late.He pushes Kate three stories down causing her to break her neck and suffer a misscarriage. She gets lethally poisoned at the hospital by the nanny and both of them died.I thought this movie had a mean twist to it. It was good but certainly wasn't a hit and they most likely wont make a sequel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A prime example of Anti-Christ movie-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I call this movie "a prime example of Anti-Christ movie-making", I mean that capitalism is the Anti-Christ, and this movie was made purely to cash in on poor saps like us who vainly go to see it, hoping there's any shred of quality in it.It was a dull movie throughout, on a level that might justify a "3" or a "4" rating. What clinches it as awful enough to be a "1" is the offensively bad ending. Of course, it was clear that they were never going to show the ritualistic killing of a child, so it was no surprise that Damien lived. But I was hoping for an ending that jumped ahead in time to show us what would then happen to the world. What a fool I was for expecting the faintest glimmer of intelligence or excitement in this lifeless, toothless non-entity of a movie. It simply doesn't deserve to exist.The reason I went to see it (not being a horror fan, and not having seen the original) was the actors. Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles, who are usually in good movies, giving good performances. Well, not so here. What a complete waste. And the kid had no personality and hardly any lines, so he, too, was a non-entity. Pfah, I say! Bleurgh!1 out of 10.</fullReview>

Liev Schrieber does well, as always, and Julia Stiles plays a great desperate mother. And then there is Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick. He is probably the creepiest kid I have ever seen. For a first movie, he did excellently. Also, I thought that Mia Farrow was really good as a demonic nanny.2. It made me jump. A lot. In The Omen, there are some scenes that you automatically know will make you jump, but, there are also some that you don't expect. This movie made me jump more than The Exorcist.3. First rate suspense sequences. During the most on-edge parts, everything (including soundtrack, set and lighting) seem to come together and make everything perfect and give the viewer the ultimate ride.The Verdict:Was it the best movie I've seen: No Was it enjoyable: Yes Was it scary: Yes Should everyone else see it: Yes</fullReview>

I honestly don't understand the low rating this film has received; it blends all the aspects of the original, which made it great, with new and updated events and camera use. The acting is wonderfully done, especially Damien, and the actors easily fit the mold of the characters they are to portray.

		<shortDescription>A good remake of a wonderful classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This new Omen is a quite good, entertaining and very well made remake. There are several scenes that don't appear in the original, but are also good, like the first scene in which some priests are in the Vatican speaking about the End of the World. That was an excellent scene, I loved it. This new version is not as good as Richard Donner's, but it follows its tradition and it fulfills all the requirements of the original one. Robert Thorn is an American ambassador who works in London, where his wife, Katherine, has given birth, but the boy born died. Katherine didn't find out, so a priest proposes Robert to change the baby by another who has born at he the same moment and whose mother has died in the childbirth. Thorn accepts. Five years later, Damien, the boy, begins to behave of strange way and soon Robert and Katherine realize that his son is the Antichrist.The cast is great, with excellent Liev Schreiber as Robert Thorn and Julia Stiles as Katherine.Damien's babysitter, Mrs. Baylock, is performed this time by Mia Farrow, who is not as scary as the original Baylock, but she continues being a really memorable babysitter. Good remake, no doubt. Go to watch it, if you liked the original Omen. You're not going to lament.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what a remake is supposed to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me say that I'm a fan of the original, and, apparently, so are the folks behind this remake, because, for once, Hollywood didn't manage to screw it up. (See my review of "The Fog" remake for an example of "screwing it up") I think what I liked most was that they treated the original with respect and they took the story seriously. I'm so sick of these tongue-in-cheek, nudge-nudge wink-wink, self-referential horror movies. ("Scream" is a great film, but it's got a lot to answer for). The cast played it straight, and I appreciated that.The script follows the original story pretty closely, with a few minor changes and some nicely done "jump" scares. (I'll admit, they got me a couple of times) True, the score isn't exactly Jerry Goldsmith's classic "Ave Satana", but I thought Marco Beltrami did a decent, if slightly conventional, job.As for the cast : Liev Shrieber is perfect. I thought he brought a much more human, much more emotional Robert Thorne to the screen. Nothing against Gregory Peck, mind you. I actually preferred Julia Stiles' Katherine Thorne to Lee Remick's. She seemed a little more innocent and less of a, well, a bitch, frankly.Awesome supporting cast. Mia Farrow obviously took a completely different take on the Nanny role than Billie Whitelaw. Not better necessarily, just different. David Thewlis was terrific in the Photographer role. Neat accent, too.Do I detect North country? Yorkshire, perhaps? Michael Gambon is pretty much wasted as "Bugenhagen", but then, so was Leo McKern in the original. Pete Postlethwaite's "Father Brennan" is pretty much a carbon copy of Patrick Troughton in the original, and all the better for it. Finally, it's nice to see Italian genre fave Giovanni Lombardo Radice (aka John Morghen)back on screen as "Father Spiletto". (Fantastic burn make-up on him as well. Totally creepy.) Anyways, all in all I thought this was a very well-done remake that should please fans of the original as well as newcomers. Nice job, guys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Attention to detail in The Omen goes under the radar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll warn before the spoilers come:The 2006 "The Omen" has generally disappointed critics around the world. However, every review I've seen makes no mention of the attention to detail and organized symbolism. The Omen is an underrated movie, and it seems that almost no one quite understands it. If you haven't seen it yet, watch it, bring your brain, and you'll enjoy yourself. It isn't important to see the 1976 version, this movie is good enough to stand alone (I didn't even know it was a remake until after I watched the 2006 version).The mother wears white for the entire movie, and not surprisingly, she represents goodness and purity. The son, Damien (a name rooted in the word "Devil", but you knew that) almost always is wearing some sort of red on his body, and represents evil. And the father, always seen in black, represents the middle ground between the two. HERE COME SPOILERS: In this movie, red equals evil. Dogs are also a motif, usually representing evil as well. Damien's birthday party is littered with red balloons, and a calm doberman inhabits the background. The evil nanny has red hair, and Damien's room is not only completely drenched in red, but there are sixes all over the wallpaper. In the most dramatic scene of the movie, the nanny is seen gorging Damien with (the reddest of) strawberries. Then, with the red juice all over his face, Damien scooters through the whitest of hallways and bumps his white-clad mother (reaching to water some red roses) off the balcony. In another dramatic scene, the white-clad mother lies in a hospital bed, but is surrounded by red objects, the starkest being the red blanket at her feet, which almost seems to slowly climb over her body as the scene progresses. Then, of course, the nanny comes in and kills her.In the end, the father if forced to choose between supporting the mother or the son. The father is slowly won over by the good, and chooses to kill the evil son. But, as is expected, the son survives, the father dies, and all that is left is the evil, unchecked to ravage the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really didn't go into this movie with high hopes because I love - LOVE - the originally. I was pleasantly surprised that this film managed (dispite an annoying amount of product placement - motorola, how much money did you get off of this???) to preserve some of the classic beauty and intrigue of the original. I even enjoyed some of the changes. For example, when Mrs. Baylock comes to kill Katherine, she does it in a much more suttle and believable way. I always wondered in the original how she got out of the hospital after sending someone crashing through a window. And, even though I loved Remick's original Katherine, I think that Stiles perfected the role. (I wish I could say the say for Robert Thorn's character, but I'm afraid that's a role that only Peck can play in my mind.) Some things in the original, though, were absolute perfection and shouldn't have been tinkered with. When Mrs. Baylock first meets Damien, I waited for the, "I am hear to protect thee," but what I got was a watered-down nursery-school version of it. All in all, though, it was a great remake of an amazing film. Definitely something to see in the theatre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon seeing all of the trailers and listening to interviews with the actors I was really excited to see this movie. However, I left the theater today disappointed. Julia Stiles said in her interview on Regis and Kelly that this was a psychological thriller. I looked up the definition of psychological and thriller and I put the two definitions together to get this: An exciting, suspenseful movie that affects the mind. This movie was predictable at times with no sense of emotion except for the tears shed by Julia Stiles or the mean looks we get from the child. Silent Hill,for example, affected my mind and made me think of the what if's, however this movie did not. If you have seen all of the trailers for this movie...you have in essence seen the movie. For a 2 hour movie not too much happened that we already did not see in the trailers. There were times while watching the movie that I just sat there and was antsy because there was so much dead time and I was almost bored. There was hardly no character development, so we never really get to connect with the characters. I believe that sometimes we need to leave well enough alone when remaking older films. Wait for this to be aired on TV, so you don't waste your money at the box office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Respectfully done with a few minor changes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I think most "Omen" fans knew going in that they weren't going to see anything transcending or equaling the original. That would be a bit unrealistic. Julia Stiles is no Lee Remick, and Schreiber is certainly no Gregory Peck. Mia Farrow's role as Ms. Baylock does not come close that boorish original actress, whatever her name was. And finally, David Thewlis is no David Warner, at least not in this one. We do get some treats, actually more than a few; some of the stylistic additives the director decided to make work spectacularly, and I myself jumped at certain scenes as the other reviewer did. I liked seeing a different take on Damien as a little more threatening than Harvey Bernhard, although in the end I find this ineffectual. The scene in this film where Damien knocks Mrs. Thorn off the balcony with his bicycle is more maliciously done than in the first version. (Here Damien displays telepathic powers occasionally, too--that is how he and Ms. Baylock communicate and one of the ways that his mother ends up quite dead.Whether you have seen the original film or not, some of this will be genuinely frightening--possibility for nightmare frightening. The ending was done beautifully and some of the classic scenes from the 76 versions were creatively enhanced. Not really remade, just enhanced.The director wants the horror genre to survive, I think, and probably saw all the ridiculous remakes of decent ("When A Stranger Calls", etc) horror films and was unwilling to do that with "The Omen". God Bless him, no pun intended! Worth buying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I get into my review of this movie, let's talk a bit about remakes. This movie automatically has the odds stacked against it because it is, in fact, a remake. Everybody seems to be complaining that there is a current trend in Hollywood with remaking old movies and TV shows. But think about it, this is not a trend at all. Remakes have been around since the dawn of time. Did you know that The Wizard of Oz and the quote/unquote "original" Frankenstein were both remakes? Hell, The Blue Lagoon starring Brooke Shields was not only a remake, but it was actually the second time that it was remade (see: 1923 and 1949). The bottom line? Remakes have always been around and always will be. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Get over it.Now let's address the biggest complaint that you usually hear about remakes. "It isn't faithful to the original." Boo hoo. It's new. Enjoy it for what it is. If you want the original, go watch the original. The remake did not "ruin" the original, as people love to say. The original is still the same movie it always was and always will be.The Omen dares to be different. It actually is faithful to the original. But now, everyone is complaining about that! "It's too much like the original." "It's predictable." "WAAAH WAAAAH." That's right. The same people that complain about remakes being different are now complaining about this being too similar. No matter what you give them they are going to cry and complain. Yet they can't seem to stop themselves from shelling out exorbitant amounts of money to go see these movies that they wish had not been made. Makes sense.But I digress. I believe I was supposed to actually talk about the movie here. This is a good movie, people. Yes, it was predictable because I've seen the original and had a pretty good idea what was going to happen. There were some welcome changes. There were many more "jump-out-of-your-seat" scary moments in this movie. Just when I would find myself absorbed in the story something completely unexpected would happen and scare me nearly to death. This made the movie fun. God forbid you should have fun while watching a movie! The cast in the remake was definitely a good thing. Liev Schreiber delivers his usual solid performance as Robert Thorn. I had my reservations about Julia Styles being cast in a movie of this nature. But, she was surprisingly good. She is quite convincing as a distraught young mother who knows there is something not quite right about her child. Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick is the perfect Damien. I like him better than the original. He manages to be cute as a button and scary as hell at the same time. Mia Farrow's Mrs. Baylock is quite different from the original. This is another welcome change. This Mrs. Baylock is actually likable. She is friendly, lighthearted and pure evil. Her performance is reminiscent of the devil himself. He is not going to show up looking all creepy and scary. He approaches you with a smile and tricks you into trusting him. That's Mia Farrow's Mrs. Baylock. I have to add that Mia Farrow is one lady who has definitely aged gracefully. When she was young she was kind of skinny, gaunt and sickly looking. She is absolutely beautiful as an older woman.But anyway, The Omen is definitely a good movie worth seeing. It is very faithful to the original while adding a few minor and welcome changes. Forget whatever you might think about it being a remake. Just go see it and enjoy yourself for two hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Remake, and Faithful To The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING AGAIN. THIS COMMENT WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS.It's funny. I just put a comment on the original movie, THE OMEN this morning. Tonight, I had the pleasure of seeing the new updated version. I wasn't disappointed, for the most part.We have the same story, same characters, and the same wild death scenes. Add in some scares that will make you jump out of your seat, and a great movie is born.I won't make this long. I just want to say, if you're like me, a die-hard fan of the original, you will most likely enjoy this film. The actors play their roles, and they play them well. The style, atmosphere, and cinematography are all well done, also. Overall, I really enjoyed it. I will definitely get it for my collection, when it comes out on DVD.I had only a few minor complaints, that lead me to knock one point off my vote. Otherwise, I would have given it a 10, like I did for the original.Problem #1. The music was good, but doesn't come close to packing the creepy punch that Jerry Goldsmith's score did in the first film.Problem #2. The fight between Robert and Mrs. Baylock at the end was too short. In the original, the fight was much more intense.Problem #3. The death of Kathy. I don't know why they changed it, when the other deaths were so faithful to the first film. An air bubble in her IV, is much less devastating than being pushed through a window and falling several stories, before smashing through the top of an ambulance. I don't get it...Other than those pet peeves, I found the movie to be pretty damn great. I think fans of the original, will too.I give this movie a 9/10.VM "You'll see me in Hell, Mr. Thorn." -Priest On Morphine...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In my opinion better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see the omen on my sixteenth (6 of June) at 1:06 on screen 6, who said humour was dead. Like I have done so many times before I'm going to go against the tied and say I really liked the new omen movie.It had a lot of work to do to over come the original. One reason for this was that the original omen had the shock value that this film just couldn't get, because everyone already knows what happens, I mean no one knew what was going on when the original came out so this new film had a mountain to climb, plus it had to win over all the old fans, tough seeing as everyone seemed to love the original so much. Personally I think the boy who played Damien was better than the original much more malevolent. And it was on the whole a lot more dramatic, plus I'm not a great fan of the Technicolor age. I do have three problems: 1.I do think it could have had more scenes where the mother came around the corner and in the blurred background you saw Damien, just for a second so you see him but the mother doesn't, you know what I mean 2.they cut too much out of the zoo scene when I watched it I wondered were the drive though zoo had gone 3.were did the theme tune go I don't remember it at all, you know "Ave Santani".But over all I thought it was quite entertaining, it kept me interested and overall I actually thought it was better than the original especially when I watched the 76 version again, just like to say its like star wars (you spend fifteen years of your life loving the original then you watch it again after seeing the new one and its rubbish).It was dramatic it thrilled but it didn't quite horrify but what did you expect devil films usually aren't. P.S. if you want to see some thing scary see lady in black had me afraid of the dark again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first and obvious question has to be - Why? The original film has been a cross-generational favourite thanks to its easy accessibility via cable and home video.Almost anyone who is even remotely interested in the horror genre would be more than familiar with the source material.Having said that,I must admit that as a stand-alone film,this is a reasonably solid piece of entertainment.Sure,we've all become more de-sensitised and cynical since 1976 - the year of release of the first film - but a cracking good yarn always remains a cracking good yarn.Whereas the underlying feeling of doom that pervaded the first film is sadly absent in this version,the lush visuals and the inherent sense of foreboding in the tale somewhat make up.Liev Schreiber lends a quiet dignity to his part and its good to see the under-rated Julia Stiles in a role that gives her something to chew on.Mia Farrow as the evil Mrs.Baylock borders on hamming while Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick as the Anti-Christ glowers a lot but is effective nevertheless.Director John Moore serves up many more boo-moments than in the original,and while his reasons for attempting the film may be questioned,his commitment to the material certainly can't be faulted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What An Update Should Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this exactly as much as I like the original, but for different reasons. Throughout the entire film, my girlfriend and I were leaning back and forth whispering too each other, "I like how the original did that better!" "Oooh, I like that better than the original!" The overall story and script are almost verbatim. It's a different cast, a different director, and updated to include things like cell phones and digital cameras.This is what a remake should be. It's not Psycho...it's not the same movie with a different cast. It's more like what the original would have been if it had been nowadays.There were some things that were cheesy, true, but there was a major cheese-factor to the original film. The ending isn't nearly as climactic, Liev Schreiber is no Gregory Peck, and Mia Farrow isn't nearly as creepy enough, but on the other hand all the things in the original that I thought didn't work (like Damien, who I think is unbelievably creepier in this film than in the original) was done much better than I expected.If you're a hardcore fan of the original, maybe you should pass on this, but if you want to enjoy a good film that pays respect to it's predecessor, I'd recommend this whole-heartedly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw the Greg Peck version aeons ago. Liked it, tho found the final third a little unfathomable. This one, on the other hand, is tighter, more lucid and wonderfully photographed. It's worth watching in the cinema, too, as the leap-out-of-your-seat shock moments are enhanced by the shrieks and squeals of a willing audience. Hats off to Schrieber, Postlethwaite and particularly Thewlis (or should that be heads off?) for top drawer performances. And on the religion-tinged blockbuster front, this is infinitely better than the execrable Da Vinci Code. Only shame is, why aren't they writing horror flicks as good as the Omen these days? Must be time for someone to get their hands on ... ah, but that would be telling. Think I'll write it myself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i was very excited to see a remake of the original movie that i liked a lot, bought my ticket for the 715pm showing on 6/6/6 (which seemed like a lot of fun!) prepared for the movie and sat through the dreadful "20" info-mercial they force you to watch!!! I enjoyed the movie, but it was very predictable in the sense i felt like i had just seen all this before, same order, same scenes, but that wasn't why i rated it a 5, Julia Stiles has to be the CARDBOARDIEST actress ever to come out of Hollywood! any long scene with her in it was a SNOOZE! even her first line when her husband bring her "her" baby. She looks up at him and says, "Hello" - almost robotic. She seemed way too young to play the part. I tried to like her, but i just couldn't! Other than that, i liked this movie, the gore / kill scenes were fantastic. I was hoping to see how they would do the kill of the photographer in this one and it doesn't disappoint! I was happy when Damien knocked his "mother" over the edge - that looked painful! Give this movie a try if you can stand 2 D acting from the leads! DJ Eric Austin TX</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total, Utter Garbage...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just about everything was horrible about this movie. First off, Julia Stiles does not belong in any kind of movie that is intended to inspire fear in the viewer. She belongs in movies like 10 Things I Hate About You, not The Omen. I don't care if she's grown up, she still looks like she's 15. Not only that, but she's ridiculously horrible in this film. The acting was so mediocre, I can't even tell you.Mia Farrow, who I think was casted as kind of a hats off for her role in another Satan- oriented movie from the 70's, Rosemary's Baby, was probably one of the biggest mistakes of the movie. She was basically cute little Mia Farrow, not the evil Governess - there was no acting involved, whatsoever. She could be really scary if she decided to actually act - I think the director was scared to tell Mia that she was coming across as a soccer mom, not an evil henchman of hell on earth. In the original, when she first meets the boy, the original governess says (in a thick Scottish accent, no less) . . "Fear not, little one . . I am here to protect thee." . . in the new one, "Hello Damian, my name is Ms. Baylock! Don't be scared, I'm here to protect you!" . . . boooorrriiinnnggg!They screwed up the story line royally. In the original, everything made so much more sense in parts. For instance, the CHURCH scene was 10 times more scarier in the original film. And the exchange between the governess and the mother actually made sense in the original as well. What mother would insist that her son go to church even though he's sick? In the original the governess actually makes a comment that he's too young to understand church, thus warranting the reply "Have Damian dressed and downstairs in 5 minutes" by the mother.I'll give it one thing, I did jump a couple of times in the movie. But that didn't make the movie great. The deaths were also a bit more colorful in the film, but the only one I'll give kudos to is the death of Father Brennan in front of the church because he had shards of stained glass in his face. AND the burned priest part was scary as hell, leading into the crazy graveyard scene. Other than that, forget this remake . . Whats sad is that I would bet MAYBE only 25% of the people in the theater saw the original, let alone knew that there WAS an original . . . remakes like this and Amityville Horror are ruining the legacy of the originals totally. If there is someone smart enough to maybe go back and try to see the original, then great, but I dunno.Okay . . end rant.</fullReview>

Please some one give use real tension and real horror.Did anyone else notice the boom mics in shot during the kitchen conversation? Please polish up your film before you release it!! maybe it would have come out on the 7/6/06 not the same effect huh? Ah well someone please look at some Japanese horror!! The Ring, Dark water anything they just ooze Tension Two sisters was the best I have seen in a long time.Every scene dragged on and on each word an eternity from the last. The director tried to and tension to the film but added boredom instead.

The plot is basically the same but this movie is more graphic with more shock value scenes than the original. The crowd at the theater jumped at least 3 times and I did as well even though I basically knew what was coming. None of my friends had seen the original but they all enjoyed this film.

		<shortDescription>Why make it again?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One word to sum it - Stale.To begin with, though I managed to watch it on The Day 6-6-06, I missed the 06:06 pm show. Not much there to miss as i found out, except for the Number of the Beast.The question to be answered is - WHY? Why make it again? The new version does absolutely nothing new. It is almost a shot-for-shot remake. The atmosphere is identical, the camera angles are identical, even many of the dialogues sound the same. Added to that, the the actors are low profile and so is the music, which is far from Jerry Goldsmith's scary rendition in the 1976 original. And the lead actor is no match for Gregory Peck's impeccable performance as a man fighting his own beliefs in the battle against evil.Of course, the deaths are more gruesome, a trend that seems to have been started by the Final Destination movies. The sound effects are good but they still cannot make up for the fact that there is absolutely no suspense that we don't already expect.If you haven't seen the original version yet, go watch that first. This one can wait.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just like the original, but without (most) of the good bits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a huge fan of the original, I took the first available opportunity to see The Omen yesterday. I went to the cinema in hope, rather than expectation of seeing an inspired remake, and my caution proved well justified.Now to me the original film had three great strengths; memorable performances from the key actors, fantastic death sequences and the fantastic Jerry Goldsmith score. The new movie undermines all three; Firstly, to me, the key roles in the movie are those of the priest, Father Brennan, and the nanny, Mrs Baylock. It is the conviction and intensity of the performances of Patrick Troughton and Billie Whitelaw that give the story credence. To be fair to Pete Postlelthwaite, his performance is creditable, but I don't think anyone could've looked as haunted and damned as Troughton did. However, Mia Farrow as Mrs Baylock!!! WHY! WHY! WHY! The satanic uber-psycho bitch of the original has been replaced by somebody who looks as they should be working in a tea shop.Now with regard to the death sequences, I was fine with Father Brennan's demise, and I'm even willing to let the decapitation go, but to who thought "let's not throw Mrs Thorn out of the hospital window, lets give her a lethal injection!?" God, even the moment of ambiguity at the end of the film, where it is not initially clear whether Damien survived has been removed.Finally. IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO A REMAKE THAT IS FAITHFUL TO THE POINT OF INCLUDING USING LARGE PASSAGES OF DIALOGUE FROM THE ORIGINAL WORD, FOR WORD. HOW CAN YOU JUSTIFY OMMITING WHAT WAS ARGUABLY THE CORNERSTONE OF THE ENTIRE TRILOGY'S SUCCESS ? THE ORIGINAL SCORE.Without the original score, any sense of impending dread has been completely lost. The all new, wholly nondescript score just compounds a hugely flawed remake to the point of just being beyond redemption! PS. If the film crew are going to shoot a film in Eastern Europe, and then hope to pass it off as London, THEN AT LEAST BOTHER TO COVER UP THE SIGNS ON THE STREETS THAT YOU ARE FILMING ON! Just noticed a trailer go online for the Texas Chainsaw Massacre prequel, and seen that Rob Zombie is shooting a new Halloween film. Can all this PLEASE stop now??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Most Impressive Remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, today June 6, 2006 or 6/6/06 marked the opening of "The Omen" remake. I saw it earlier this afternoon and I must say, I was quite impressed. Now, we're all aware of Hollywood's obsession to remake everything these days. Most are trite, unremarkable, or simply unnecessary. Some are just plain awful, especially when it comes to modern redos of the classic horror movies (like "The Amityville Horror" remake in 2005) and of course movies based on old TV shows. I have been begging Hollywood for something new and original for almost a decade, but it seems that for now, its just going to be remake after remake. "The Omen" however surprised me. I'm a fan of the original film and its sequels. I had seen remake previews on entertainment shows like "Access Hollywood" and "Extra," so from what I had seen I knew it followed the original film to some extent. However, upon seeing the movie today, it proved to be one of the better remake films I had seen in quite some time. For the most part, the 2006 remake stays true to the original film exactly, simply revitalizing it with a modern take. And for once, it actually worked, so apparently the story is timeless, unlike many films which are so dated they can't be retold in another era accurately. Let's take a look at the actors. First billed was Julia Stiles. Like another reviewer, I felt that she was a bit too young to be playing the part of Damien's mother, since the actress in the original was a much older, more mature woman. However, she played the part well. Next, there was Liev Schrieber as Robert Thorn. Now, no offense, but that was quite a step down from the great Gregory Peck. Peck was a legend and an esteemed actor from the old days of Hollywood. But personally, I love Liev Schieber. I think he's been great in everything he's done and I thought he did an excellent job in this film. At times, his voice even sounded like Peck's, as did the photographer sound much like the English actor from the original. Next was Pete Postlethwaite as the priest who got speared. Another actor I love in every film I've seen him in, a terrific Shakespearean actor and a consummate professional. Believe it or not, I thought this part was a bit two dimensional and did not allow him to show the extent of his abilities, but for that simple reason, he did a great job with the role. Being someone who is tired with all the remakes today, and who has been generally disappointed with what Hollywood and the movie industry has become today, "The Omen" was a pleasant surprise. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, certainly more than I thought I would going into the theater. It stayed true to the original while adding a few new elements, some of which worked, others didn't, but neither altered or detracted from the film at all. It was serious enough, but didn't make the mistake of taking itself too seriously as so many movies do these days. It never felt over the top, even when considering the fact that it was indeed a big budget Hollywood production. The actors and their performances were on par, very believable and very effective. Overall, the entire production was very well done. My only gripes with the remake were firstly Marco Beltrami's score. The original, classic theme by Jerry Goldsmith as well as its entire influence on the movie were gone, replaced by another of Beltrami's bland works. I have never been impressed with his scores, from Scream to Resident Evil to Terminator 3, his music serves, but never paints a portrait, creates a mood, compliments the picture or captures the audience. In the case of The Omen, music was there when it needed to be, but nothing intriguing or remarkable and very forgettable. Secondly, this new movie followed the original so closely, it almost begged the question, "Why remake the film at all?" Why not simply leave the classic story allow. I think a friend of mine answered that best. This remake is a modern retelling for a new generation. It brings the story back for those who remember the original, never saw it, or were too young to understand it. And it does just that, and almost flawlessly if I might add. Now a whole generation who missed the original can experience this new film for themselves. That, and of course, the studio was able to capitalize of the significance of 666 and the release the date 6/6/06, which won't happen again for a thousand years. Again, not a perfect 10, but if you can watch it for what it is, a modern Hollywood remake, and accept it as such, I think you will enjoy this film. I did. Definitely a cut above the rest. If you liked the first Omen, go see this movie. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All in all The Omen(2006) was a good movie. The reason I'm not giving it a 10 is due to the scare factor, I just wasn't scared enough. But like most other movies i have to hand it to Fox, i jumped out of my seat about 4 or 5 times. I was somewhat disappointed because there wasn't as many killings/deaths as i expected but the few that took place were perfectly done. That little boy has such an evil smile, the casting directors did a good job in finding the right actors for each character. The ending seems to leave me wanting for more but at the same time I wish the dad would have killed little Damien at the church. You get bloodthirsty with these kinds of films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthwhile to see in the theater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was fairly scary, although it wouldn't have had as much of an effect if I was watching it on DVD in my living room. I definitely recommend watching it at a theater, with the loud music and storm sound effects etc. The acting really didn't seem as bad as people say, although Julia Stiles does seem really young to be a mother. But all in all it was pretty good. The demonic visuals were pretty much the scariest part about this movie, they caught me off guard. The deaths, however, were very predictable. I haven't even seen the original and I knew exactly when each person was going to die. Definitely not as scary as I would have expected, but a good jump none-the-less. I won't be having nightmares tonight though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought The Omen was a good movie. i jumped a couple of times. apparently it reminded a couple of my friends a bit of the shining. That kid who played Damien was perfect for the part. The amount of blood and gore was balanced with romance and action. This could possibly go along with the Da Vinci code, using the bible against "christian" beliefs. What I thought was amazing about it, was when the credits started rolling it was 6:06 (not sure on the seconds, but we'll just say it was 6.) The story line was easy to follow, and though i have not seen the first movie, I thought it was good. I'd watch it again. on that note, I'll leave you with this, Merry 666. Go see it, this is one movie actually worth the money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasonably good, but could be so much better...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard that the 1976 classic movie directed by Richard Donner was in the for the remake treatment, I was very excited. Due the the expanded technology and today's style of film-making I thought the new film would do very well.I just come back after seeing the first showing at my local and I don't know what to say about this version. It has its high and low points...The photography was not glossy in the slightest. It was shaky and poorly lit in places...OK, here we go...***BEGINNING OF SPOILER ALERT*** The titles reminded me of "Omen III - The Final Conflict" for some reason due to the observatory scene looking very similar to "The Holy Trinity" scene in the 1981 sequel.I thought Liev Schrieber did a very good job as Robert, but seemed a bit wooden in performance. Gregory Peck showed emotion in the original, especially when he hears about the death of his wife Katherine, played by Lee Remick. Now, Julia Stiles didn't hit it on the spot with me. I thought Lee was far better in the part. Julia just looked uncomfortable and seemed to be casted at the last moment! A very nice comeback for Mia Farrow, but just wasn't evil enough compared to Billie Whitelaw's terrifying performance as Mrs. Baylock. I expected Mia to turn nasty in terms of character but she usually sounded nice and calm, even when she killed Julia's character. David Thewlis was perfect for the role of Jennings as he sounded and looked similar to David Warner's interpretation of the original character. Lastly, Damien Thorn played by Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick was OK but not a patch on little Harvey Stephens from the original. He just looked bored, kinda what Dr. Evil said - He's is the Diet Coke of evil: One calorie, not evil enough!!! I liked the little subtle changes in the version which had made me smile, such as the use of "Digital" photos which showed the premonition marks and the way Robert traps the dog near the end. I, being a major fan of the original and reading the original novel, knew how the movie would end so hopefully must of the moviegoers will know what's coming who have seen the 1976 version.Much of the movie, it's dialogue, camera shots are nearly the same so I did get a bit bored in parts. The decapitation was very well done but the new deaths such as Kate's and Mrs. Baylocks were very disappointing. I won't reveal too much but I left with mid-satisfaction. John Moore, the new director resorted to a few loud scares, which never work with me. A lot of strange flashes including Damien wearing a mask, very similar to Jim Carrey's "wooden" Mask of the same name! I don't know, like I said it had its good and bad points. The people around me groaned when they left the Cinema, first time I seen a reaction like that since Batman Begins! ***END OF SPOILER ALERT*** Overall, it was OK but could be so much better. Go and rent the classic on 06.06.06 instead for the real experience!!!! I wish they re-released the original on the release date in theatres, it would've been a winner!!! (But it was better than Omen IV: The Awakening!) PS - WHY OH WHY didn't John Moore use Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar-winning score for the film? Marco Beltrami's composition was dreadful, not memorable and very dull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Today's horror movies vs. horror movies 30 years ago</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching many horror remakes of some of my favorite classic horror movies (not to be confused with the 'old original' horror classics such as the original Dracula, Phantom of the Opera, etc) as well as horror movies made today and even the past 10 years, I've come to realize why many people are disappointed with today's horror/slasher movies (sans the remakes): It's the storytelling.The low-budget indie slasher flicks that have become cult favorites such as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, and even the original Friday the 13th, to name a few, while shot on extremely low budgets and poor effects that would seem amateur by today's standards did excel in one area and that was in its storytelling.Not just the plot, but the directing. The director's of these old slasher movies did a great job of drawing you into the story. Then there are the classic horror movies that stand out as incredible stories include the original Exorcist, Omen, and even the Prince of Darkness. These three movies I would categorize as horror/suspense whereas Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th, and similar movies would fall into the horror/slasher. There are several more to name off but the difference is the type of storytelling/directing.The movies of today and the past 10 years - most of them starting after the first Scream movie (which I still consider a horror/satire), are missing this art of storytelling. Even the horror/slasher films of today have very shallow plots. You can almost tell when a horror movie is going to have a shallow plot by the studio behind it and the excessive marketing (almost).Aside from the "Scream" carbon-copy movies in the late 90's, the movies in the past couple years such as Saw, Hostel, and See No Evil - while the latter is at least entertaining, they fail to draw the audience in with a great and original story.The realization came after watching See No Evil last week and The Omen remake tonight. The Omen remake maintains most of the style of the original, including the story element. It's hard to even categorize the both as horror movies because of the vast differences in storytelling.I suppose to conclude, I would have to say that it is the story or lack thereof that separates a horror/suspense from a horror/slasher movie.I liked all the movies I mentioned here, except Hostel which I found to be almost nothing but a studio promo. They hyped up the movie SO much and 'promised' some of the most shocking and horrifying cinema made yet, that when I finally saw it, I felt let down. Saving Private Ryan had more shockingly horrifying moments than Hostel.I also salute Rob Zombie for paying homage to the classic 70's horror/slasher genre yet maintaining originality in his storytelling, in his movie House of 1000 Corpses. This movie reminded me of a cross between Texas Chainsaw Massacre and 2000 Maniacs.I enjoyed the modernization of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, however I've yet to see the 2000 Maniacs remake.The Omen remake did a great job of combining modern cinema-effects while preserving the art of the story. While some may consider the movie "slow", I attribute that to the A.D.D. that society has developed. I also enjoyed the modernization of this movie and the inclusion of footage of several recent catastrophic events used in the story. While I was a little surprised by this, I found it a clever way to use such tragic events respectfully, yet successfully in a horror movie.I give The Omen remake an 8 out of 10. And I plan to go see it again in the theater.-Silver Bullet P.S. Speaking of theaters, the opening night of The Omen, our theater's projector was running at a slightly slower speed causing the sound in the movie to be at a noticeably lower pitch. While this irritated me at first, I actually considered this may have been done on purpose on opening night (6/6/6) to add a creepy effect. I'm curious if anyone else in the country experienced the same effect?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Better Than The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well... there's not much to say... except that this is almost better than the original! When i heard about this remake sometime last year... I have to admit i was actually like "Oh crap another re-make!" But actually i was really happy and surprised with this film. Director John Moore really captured the original power of the child of Satan. He made some of the best casting i have seen in re-makes i have seen in a long time. I first thought that Julia Stiles would do a bad job at this movie but she did such a good job at the character of Katherine Thorn. The character of Robert Thorn played by Liev Schreiber did a fantastic job as his character. He was almost exactly like the character in the original. I would like to also give a special shout out to Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick who played the character of Damien. He did a tremendous job considering it was only his second movie. Also this movie was mostly good because Director John Moore stayed so close to the original movie with only making small changes that made no difference to anything the movie had to do with, putting more detail and fantasy which helped to understand the movie more, and adding in better computer generations which helped the movie look more visually appealing to people. Now... Every good movie has some mistakes that made it not be such a good movie, but this movie had very little. Some of the things i found out was that in the beginning where the nanny kills herself... The dog she looks at is a different dog than the rotwiler the rest of the movie uses. And another thing that somewhat annoyed me was the shaky camera they used when bad was happening, i know it was used for dramatic effect but it made it hard to visualize the characters at that point of the movie and was very hard to watch. The production studio also deserves some respect for coming up with the idea of releasing it on June 6, 2006. 6:6:06. Considering the movie has a lot to do with the number 666, it was a very creative idea for them to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Release date is gimmicky but so what? This is pure entertainment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to opening night and the theater was PACKED. I could not see one empty seat and the first showing I tried to go to was sold out. Anyway, the movie kept the whole theater riveted (even with Julia Stile's unforgivable performance). It is a VERY scary movie, mixing just the right amounts of suspense, disturbing imagery, and plain old horror. It's not flawless, however. There are definitely some moments where the tempo of the movie flags and some poor cinematography choices but I would still say that it is first-rate entertainment. And since everyone in the theater applauded at the end, I guess a lot of other moviegoers would agree with me.Now I realize that this movie has received some poor reviews and the ones that are skewering Ms. Stiles' performance are legit but I have a feeling that people are offended that this movie was essentially remade for the explicit purpose of releasing it on 6/6/6. That is true but who cares?!? If John Moore wants to spend $60 million (ha! another 6!) to amuse me with an improvement on a classic film (and it is an improvement, as much as I love the original), then let John Moore have his way. The release date is gimmicky but it's fun and it certainly doesn't mean the final product isn't worth seeing. And personally, I'm psyched to see that the 70's religious horror genre making a full circle comeback that is symbolized by Mia Farrow's casting. This is an excellent addition to this tried-and-true genre; don't let the haters get you down and go out and see it as soon as you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Art Direction/Poor Casting-Scoring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the remake of The Omen today. The first thing I noticed was that Jerry Goldsmith's acclaimed score was replaced. Why? His score for Basic Instinct was reworked and sounded great in that remake. The second thing I noticed was how nice the cinematography looked compared to the 1976 original. The colors were richer and the art direction was well done. Having the priest meet Thorn under a Gothic bridge in the pouring rain was very effective.I thought the casting didn't work compared to the original. Lee Remick came across as a more believable ambassador's wife. The kid who played Damien, in this version, was not creepy or convincing at all. Mia Farrow was very bland. She was not right for the part. Mrs. Baylock is supposed to be a smile-in-your-face/stab-you-in-the-back nanny. Mia only got the "smiling" part down.If you liked the original, you'll still enjoy this one. All but one of the "death" scenes have been altered and they did a pretty good job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very creepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not see the original which probably made this film better for me, I've heard it wasn't as good. But this film literally scared me, the people saying the film sucked are wrong, it was quite good. The little kid was a great actor. The one casting mistake i noticed was Julia Stiles as the mother Katherine Thorn. The images of 9/1/1 and hurricane katrina were disturbing and scary to see, but the images fit the prophecy. Julia stiles did not really show the fear she had of her child or in the bathroom scene or the zoo scene which shocked the hell out of me. The film started creepy then showed very disturbing images of current world disasters, it became very creepy during a scene on the highway. Then there were the scenes of Kate Thorn becoming frightened of her kid and suddenly it got a little boring and the creepiness that was supposed to be there, was not. THen suddenly, it got really suspenseful to the point i was shivering. The end was really norhing special, it wasn't exactly a surprise since five minutes before it happened, you know something was going to go wrong. I still enjoyed the film but there were some flaws, not perfect but an enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't it call the best movie, but it had its parts. It wasn't scary and i'm sure that even little kids can see it. i don't understand why they give it an R rating. The beginning was slow and boring near the end is where it gets good. There's about 3 deaths and if you don't like that kinda stuff than don't watch. I'd say its more of a religious beliefs movie and i'm not religious at all. David Thewlis and Michael Gambon were in it and sadly one of them dies, a most tragic death. I thought it would be creepy and i was sadly disappointed. 3 stars. Watch it if you want but its not worth you're money. It has a series of twists to the plot and sometimes i was left confused. Leiv Screiber was good as the political dad who was tricked to take in the Devil baby and Julia Stiles worked as the mother, she was believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New remake is better all around.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm doing all I can to celebrate 06/06/06 and honor The Number of The Beast. With that in mind, I went to see the remake of "The Omen" today. It's the same script but I think this new version is better all around. They've added some special effects that are frightening, such as the mother having horrifying visions. The set design and location shooting are very good, especially the scene of an eerie monastery that is accessible only by rowboat. The music and photography are excellent. Damien is more obviously evil in this new movie, with no hint of innocence and Mia Farrow as the evil nanny is inspired casting. There has been some criticism of the acting by the principal characters, but I thought everyone did as well, if not better, in their roles than the original cast. The decapitation scene toward the end is the best I've ever seen in the movies. There was a middle-aged couple sitting near me in the theater and when the guy gets his head cut off, the woman squealed loudly with a mixture of shock and pure delight. I wanted to applaud and vomit at the same time. Absolutely the finest "head getting completely whacked off" I've ever seen in the cinema. I give the movie an "8".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was I expecting? Something good?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know its a little to ask for, but I thought that with the arrival of new technology and so many global incidents occurring, the time was right for the Antichrist to walk the earth once more. This is the first of 2 Dick Donner films that are to be covered this year.The Cons (to name but a few): Using younger actors to fill the boots of Peck and Remick was a mistake from the start. The film is a straight remake, taking chunks of dialogue straight from the original. The score is completely inferior to the original. Another case in Hollywood of talented actors (Gambon, Thewlis, Postlewaite) paying the bills. The dream sequences are cheap shock tactics - Dick Donner's version didn't need it The Pros: Newcomer Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick is better than his predecessor (probably because he has more dialogue). The death scenes are, on the whole, better (the head-chopping is more inventive but will not be as classic as the original). As you can guess, I love the '76 version and it is a shame when remakes are done at all. Mr. Bryan Singer has gained a lot of respect from me with his X-Men films. Let's hope his version of a Donner classic is not as bad as this was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest I wasn't expecting much from this film. However I went along with an open mind. While it is competently done,It certainly lacks the depth of the original. For a start Liev and Julia are good, but are missing the same chemistry Remick and Peck had. After all the film is really about the Thorn's and how much they love each other. With the remake because this chemistry is lacking, it's difficult to care about the the leads , despite all the horrible things going on. I remember watching the original and thinking how sad it was when Thorn found out his wife was dead,and when his car came up to the dark house and you see her picture on the locker, Vey simple , but effective. The remake is fast paced, but lacks any personal touches like these. Similarly the conversation with the doctor in the original is cut to a few seconds. Liev doesn't seem at all emotional considering his wife has nearly died and is in intensive care.That said, the death scenes are very impressive, and I really felt sick when Stiles is murdered by Mrs Baylock.The scene was very disturbing.Mia Farrow was a revelation. She made the part her own. At first as sweet as Mary Poppins then she shows her true intentions. I was very impressed with her as she had a lot to live to what with Billy Whitlaw being soooooo scary.The rest all play their parts well. I certainly couldn't complain about the casting. The new Damien isn't as sinister and that was a huge drawback.The director just seemed to be in such a hurry to get the story told with all the impressive special effects that he forgot the personal element needed to make the film work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant!! Another hit horror remake!! Clever and intelligent!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been years since I've seen the original Omen series. It is a classic and it only made sense that Hollywood would remake the classic horror film. As of late I seem to be one of few that really, really enjoy these horror remakes. The brilliant The Hills Have Eyes, When A Stranger Calls and even last years The Fog was pretty well made. I have no issue with Hollywood creating a classic story for a new generation and even putting their own spin to it. Young director John Moore even goes out of his way to set the film up with some clever imagery, and hidden surprises for people. He doesn't tone the film down to keep in tough with the original but actually comes out of the gate all guns blazing.Liev Schreiber plays Robert Thorn, the Ambassador to Italy at the time of his wife's birth. In order to spare her pain he agrees to take a child that is not theirs and raise him as his own. I've seen Schreiber in a fair amount of things and he's always done okay. I've never really seen anything from him that would show me he could be a leading man in a film. Well The Omen did it!! He shows some real acting chops and showed that he could carry the film flawlessly. His intensity, his diplomacy in his political character really showed some maturity in his ability. He was great!! Julia Stiles plays Damien's mother Katherine Thorn. I like Stiles, I really do. She has done some great work in the Bourne films, 10 Things I Hate About You, and Save The Last Dance but I think she might have been miscast for this role. She doesn't come across as mature enough to be an Ambassador's wife and even when she begins to realize the truth about Damien she comes across as not being the good person. You don't feel sorry for her, and she just seems to be completely inferior to everyone else's character in the film. Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick is the infamous Damien, the child of Satan. Seamus is adequate. The story doesn't actually hinge on his performance but rather more the character and that's a good thing because he's not quite as creepy as the young child could be. I can think of many other child actors who could really send chills down your spine, although most of them are grown now. Still Seamus does a good enough job for the part and for being so young I'm sure he has a big career ahead of me. There were times he looked goofy more than scary. Pete Postlethwaite plays Father Brennan, and although his part is small he performance is quite significance. He has great screen presence and always adds something interesting to his character roles. He meets a brutal ending in the film. Mia Farrow is deliciously evil as the new nanny Mrs. Baylock, determined to protect Damien against anything or anyone including his own parents. Her soft spoken voice but glaring evil eyes make her a terrific villain and the battle between her and Liev Schrieber at the end is edge of your seat terrifying.It really isn't the characters that truly make this film really, really well done but rather the story and the equal balance between gore horror and psychological horror. The film is absolutely gory with some truly unique, and disgusting kills but it also adds in that creepy, skin crawling aspect of Julia Stiles' dreams, and visions. The film is intelligent enough to have certain aspects of imagery such as the deep red on white background shown repeatedly and the certain flashes of 6.6.6. The setting for this film is brilliant, from Italy, to England, to Israel...the architecture for every building no matter how mundane is breath taking. Each scene is dark, gritty, ancient, beautifully shot. Schrieber absolutely holds together the story and is definitely watchable. If you loved the original, if you love a good horror/thriller you will thoroughly enjoy The Omen. On top of it being gory, captivating, thrilling they even have plenty of what I always call "cheap scares" where you will literally jump in the air at the sound of something jumping out, crashing down, being where it shouldn't be...always a lot of fun and The Omen is worth seeing. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoyed this a lot. There are two effective jump scenes. Mia Farrow is good, playing a sweetly creepy nanny. The kid does fine. Once the hero becomes convinced of his mission in the Etruscan graveyard the pace doesn't let up. Delicious decapitation. The weakest thing about it is the husband-wife relationship - either the dialogue is undercooked (too many longueurs) or the actress didn't get in to it. The touch I liked best was during the garden party: when the first nanny steps up with the noose around her neck she attracts the attention of everyone, including the two puppets in the Punch &amp; Judy show. Postlethwaite is difficult to understand when the rain is lashing down. Don't understand why the bristling alsatian was replaced with rottweilers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a completely cynical hollow exercise by Fox, remounting more or less exactly the same script as before and making it cheaply in Prague. By this time you would have thought it was incumbent on anyone remaking a movie to add something to it or offer something new. Here nobody has bothered to do so. In fact what few changes there are make for less suspense and some laughs. The boy is fine, the actors average, though David Thewliss gives all he can in the part of the photographer. The effects are in many ways little different from the first one, nothing has been added. Ultimately all this amounts to is a lame plagiarism of Richard Donner's original which badly misses his style and skill. It deserves to fail or we will get more unimaginative copies like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Portent of Good Things to Come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the only aspect of this remake altered significantly from the original motion picture was the international release date, specifically chosen by the studio to play on number of the beast associations. Thirty years ago it the world was different, with no such thing as a universal release (The Omen 2006 came out everywhere on the same fateful day), and perhaps a mite more sensitivity to issues satanic, hence the caution evident back then.But aside from release dates as marketing ploys, scant has changed. Characters and events follow the 1976 edition almost to a tee, and even names haven't been tampered with as often happens with remakes. Some might claim this indicates a lack of innovation, since connecting the dots doesn't entirely amount to pristine movie making at its pinnacle. After all, three decades are quite the interim, and there was much producers could have done to keep current aside from incorporating cell phones and LCD monitors.This reviewer begs to differ. Young director John Moore, who previously made only a handful of movies like Behind Enemy Lines and Flight of the Phoenix, has steered this release safely onto the calm waters of distinct flavor, helping bestow on the newer picture a mood peculiar to it, delineating the tendency to attempt and recapture the vibe of an older release (a venture frequently doomed to failure), and erecting a structure able to withstand the vagaries of a summer season bristling with high-profile remakes (see Miami Vice).So while similarities essentially amount to story ingredients, 2006 sees a drastically different movie than the one shown audiences back in the 70's. Additionally, because the story's so well known and established, there's very little to surprise viewers in that regard. Ergo, Moore's decision to focus on stylistic modification paid off, with The Omen coming across a compelling watch despite harboring no major twists, and being shown to people the world over who've been jaded clean by scores of conspiracy stories packing much more shock value than The Omen franchise. Having the movie still end up enjoyable in light of all this is testament to its success.Likely the biggest difference one notes upon seeing the remake is the bigger deal they make of the whole 666 thing, although it was also present in the 1976 iteration to some extent. Here it's seen as a birthmark denoting Damien Thorn (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) as a hell-spawn little brat unknowingly visited on aristocrats the Thorns, a family of well-to-do upper-crustaceans with strong ties to the American political machine.Father Robert (Liev Schreiber) chooses to feign ignorance for as long as possible as a benefit to his fragile wife Katherine (Julia Stiles). The illusion comes to a grinding halt when signs of imminent Armageddon are observed by Vatican officials, prompting an attempt to locate Damien and pre-empt evil's amassed onslaught on humanity. One clergyman, Father Brennan (Pete Postelthwaite) tries harder than most to contact the family and warn them, but meets with yet another grisly horror-movie demise.Another story-arc revolves around Robert joining forces with intrepid paparazzi reporter Keith Jennings (David Thewlis from Naked and Kingdom of Heaven), hoping to identify the true nature of Damien's evil and his origins as the son of Satan. This takes them to various locations in Italy and the Middle East, of course putting them in harm's way.It's funny so much of the story can be given away without risking overexposure and spoilage, but then it's a much-retold horror standard and most people are familiar with it one way or another. The Omen 2006 bypasses this handicap when it provides solid entertainment comprising manifold, diverse parts while never becoming bogged down or even near the point of boredom. It's evident careful consideration was allotted each segment, and the movie moves along effortlessly. It's also OK to look at artistically, featuring gore in keeping with its genre, but also convincing locales and effects.Acting's not as tight as might have been hoped for, particularly the interaction between Schreiber and the oft excellently-detached Stiles felt too mechanical and forced, while young Davey-Fitzpatrick's cover of Damien seemed perfunctorily economical, imbuing no real sensation either way. We knew what he was all about by virtue of the well-traversed story, not more.On the other hand, Thewlis and Schreiber communicated beautifully, giving off a very workable relationship, making us believe they really were working against the clock and had something common of great value at stake here. Another highlight came from Mia Farrow, rendering wicked Nanny Baylock (before done by Billie Whitelaw) as the conduit by which evil's maintained a safe haven in the Thorn household. It's good to see the veteran actress in the limelight again, although few performances can come close to dizzying heights she's achieved with Rosemary's Baby, arguably one of the classics that inspired the look and feel of 1976 The Omen.This incarnation also ends obviously on a sequelish note, so expect remakes of several other Omen story lines in the near future. Put together with other points made above, this qualified Omen '06 as a competent work of interpretive cinema and an affable summer treat. It has more to do with gore than horror, and seasoned viewers have nothing to fear within. Mainstream or lay audiences were probably more of a target for 20th Century Fox, providing screams and gasps as the movie dishes out one of several ghoulish moments courtesy of hell hounds, beheadings and implements of impalement.A good reprise, The Omen returns to satisfy with the series' trademark wink. Not to be taken too seriously, it opens up possibilities for resurgent enfranchisement, and hope for horror-leaning movie buffs everywhere.Rating: * * * *</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst films i ever saw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of films, generally, any film that has a little spark captures me and impresses me, but this movie was just AWFUL... Besides that Julia Stiles played one of her worst roles (if anybody saw Save the last dance, would agree with me, she acted much better in that film), the film has only about 5 scary scenes. I admit that the scene with the death of father spiletto was very good realized, but it seemed to me that i was watching Final destination, not a movie about the end of the world, the Antichrist, plus that the end let's you expect part 2 of omen, which proves that the movie is a kitch, because the sign of the Beast - 666 is available only that day 06.06.06... In that day should be the end of days. But of course i'm just a viewer not a critic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horrible home video.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from the shallow acting, loose script, and horrible special effects...there are no redeeming factors for this film. To begin, anyone who has no knowledge of biblical text, or has not seen the original film, will be somewhat lost. Throughout this film, the characters consistently know and understand the plot, while the audience is left guessing. Also, the Jason XXXI type gore was bland. Damien, who is supposed to be the Anti-Christ, plays a smaller role than the boom mics. Yes, you heard me, the boom mics. You know, those long microphones that are usually attached to long arms, which are often raised above actors in order to catch their vocals? Well, those oh so beloved boom mics were visible in nearly ever single shot that was indoors after the first 20 minutes of the film. Is this some horrible new method of film making, or are the editors of this film blind? It was completely unbelievable, I have seen better cinematography in a 90 minute soft-core porno on Showtime. Stage lights in the corners of sets, and mirrors painted black to avoid reflection editing. WONDERFUL. So, in my opinion, this film was lacking is so many needed areas. I seriously considered demanding my money back, though the thought of going home excited me more than having to submit myself to that film, or anything associated with it any longer. Unless you want a few cheap laughs, or if you want to see the horrid film making with your own eyes, don't go see this high school short film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well I gave it a try . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read many comments posted here before writing this and found that the people who saw the 1976 version were disappointed so and those who didn't were at least happy. So here's what I think. Number 1 see the original. At it's time it was far scarier than this one. Now the favorite "devil" appearance in a movie as voted on IMDb was in the South Park movie.What a joke! Ha ha ha.When the original version came out the devil was far more obscure. There weren't 10,000 specials about the devil on cable and Arnie wasn't fighting the devil. When the original movie came out no one knew what kind of dog that was and the speculations on it's lineage were amazing . No one. No one knew it was a Rottweiler. When that dog made his terrifying appearance there was no history of a really menacing dog in cinema except for TheHound of the Baskervilles. Dogs were our friends. They were Lassie and Rin-tin-tin. If anyone says they did they are liars. Oh yeah, they also changed dogs from the first dog you see( A black Shepard) to the aforementioned Rotty for who knows what reason. The Devil was one very scary son of a bitch. The Devil still is. This movie does suffer in comparison. Liev Schreiber is a fine actor. Julia Stiles did a passable job for a woman of less than classic appearance. Peck and Remick however were GREAT actors. They were able to bring the patrician presence necessary to a couple who are portraying an Ambassador and his wife to Throne of England. This new pairing could be ambassadors to say, Weehawken New Jersey. Plus the 76 version was filmed in - guess where? Well that would be England. Duuuh! England has a particular look and it doesn't look like Prague. I hate it when I see a movie that is supposed to be in New York City and is filmed in Toronto and this movie accomplished that by obviously not being filmed in England. The Omen kid in this movie wasn't even close as far as being scary as Harvey Stevens and for some reason we have to get his annoying middle name zzzzzzz. If you are going to stay this close to the original you might as go the whole way.Examples I can give are when the first attractive woman, Holly Palance) nanny jumps off the building the rope snaps her up and she crashes through a window. This poor woman just sort of lumps out "between" the widows and thumps up against the wall. The 76 version is shown from several angles this is an image that I clearly picture 30 years later and is truly and adds the horrible sound effects and slow motion photography filmed from multiple angles to create a very disturbing image. Another moment was the appearance of Mrs Baylock. If I ever saw Billie Whitelaw the original Mrs. B I would immediately become incontinent. This woman's first appearance in screen was one of the scariest moments in movie history. Her eyes positively glow with fanaticism and it is obvious she almost hypnotizes the parents of young Damien. The scene where she bond with young Damien is super creepy. Mia Farrow is so tiny and delicate and has such a pleasant face she just doesn't come close. The topper is that when Whitelaw as Mrs. Baylock encounters Ambassador Thorn in the final moments of the movie their fight to the death had me jumping out of my seat and it still has that effect even though I've seen it several times. And now we come to the most glaring omission of all. The original score by the genius Jerry Goldsmith. To enumerate his musical achievements would be a separate book.. Every once In a while you get a few teases of the Oscar winning score. That score with it's heartbeat driven theme and the screaming choral crescendos completely makes this movie the classic that it has become. Look up his name and if you are on this site and somehow not aware of his musical contributions please look him up. I have many of his albums and his music can be incredibly beautiful and soaring, super mysterious(Chinatown) and in the case of the Omen and other sci-fi/horror classics totally terrifying. Patton, Poltergeist, Alien, The Blue Max, L.A. Confidential, Star Trek, Hoosiers, Basic Instinct, Mulan, The Sand Pebbles. A Patch of Blue are included among his over three hundred film scores which demonstrated his amazing versatility. Oh yeah - he also wrote some music for the Twilight Zone in the original series and did the movie thirty years later. Batten down the hatches and see the "old one" then see this movie, on video. I wish they would restore and reissue the old one and re-release it.Some of the supporting roles were excellent especially David Thewlis as the photographer and the actor that played Bugenhagen were very fine and must have seen the original and realized that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. The two cursed priests and the original nanny's were not so lucky as they suffered greatly in comparison.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course, i couldn't let myself pass up the opportunity to see this movie on 06 06 06, and wow, i was Definitely not disappointed. To be honest i didn't expect much from this movie, being that it was a remake, i saw the original though and liked it a lot, so i thought what the hey. The movie was VERY faithful to the original, the omen was in its own way beautiful, the lighting and colors and repetition of the same scarlet red made the movie even more of a thrill to watch, the storyline was great, the acting was superb, no cheesy lines in this movie (cough cough Silent Hill). I must admit a little slow at first but it picks up quickly and stays suspenseful until the end. The gore in the omen was incredible, so realistic and there is no such thing as camera turning in this movie, believe me, they show it all. Lots of scary parts and yeah, you will jump, i don't care who you are YOU WILL JUMP and or SCREAM at least once. It is definitely the best scary movie i have seen in a while, and also by far one of my very favorites.If you like horror, gore, cult and suspense.... GO SEE THE OMEN!!! you will not regret it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the WORST movies I ever saw. I am a huge movie fan of any and every genre and this was a pathetic piece of crap. I was ready to leave the movie theater while watching this, the only reason I didn't was because I finally caught up on some sleep. The script was terrible, the acting was the same, the basic story plot was a good idea but everything else ruined it. The deaths (which there were like 2 of them) were extremely fake, every move was predictable. This was a real disappointment, the only good thing about this movie was the day it came out and nothing else. I did not see the original, but i have a feeling that it might be about a thousand times better than this movie. For modern technology, and better blood/gore/graphics, this movie could've been a lot better. I'm not saying it wasn't violent enough, I'm just saying that it could've been a MUCH better job. Save your money, do not go see it!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tonight I saw this movie with quite an expectation of a new an fine horror movie, that will not only let my blood stuck but also reveal some more than only the usual shockers. But, as I had to admit to myself, this movie is nothing than the usual horror trip into loud bangs and flashy lights that shock you for 2 sec and than all is as peaceful as it was. This genre has far more potential than displaying a head as it flies from a throat. Also there is to mention that the acting is very disappointing. SChreiber has only some good moments, although the movie gives a lot a chances to show some talent. But one will not arrive to get into this man properly, the figure remains flat and indistinct. Only the little Davey-Fitzpatrick can give us an impression of his evilness and nastiness, but, there is to say that this role was not very difficult to play, as this child is a good part of the movie just sitting around and looking unhappy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A not so good remake of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say from the beginning: the original is far better. In the original the cast was much more believable, and the atmosphere... well, it really gives you the shivers.In a nutshell, this remake does not stand up to the original. In this remake, you'll find nothing really new in the story, only a few changes here and there. The only scary things are the 3 "quiet and then bang" scenes intended to scare you.People who haven't seen the original may like this movie though. It is somehow adapted to our times. But it is boring! Unfortunately, because one would think that with a remake, you might see something new, something added, something interesting. Well, you won't see it here.So, if you want a very light "horror"-"thriller" go watch this movie. A much better choice would be rental of "The exorcism of Emily Rose".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood and their blasted remakes.. See the original please! Of course I was disappointed because the original "The Omen" I believe that came out in 1976 was much more real and more intense.. I thought this one seemed fake. I also feel that the actors in the original film, such as Gregory Peck, were ripped off and forgotten on their brilliant work. Though "The Omen" that came out today was chilling in some scenes and they tried to bring back the terror from the original. It didn't please me, I didn't like how they changed the Tricycle scene with Damien and put him on a scooter. It also didn't amuse me how they changed the priests death to glass other than when he got pinned with the pole. Why is Hollywood remaking every film? Don't they have any original ideas? I bet the next film they will remake is The Godfather.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this in Brighton, UK today - 06/06/06 no less.So - as good as the original? No. Close? No. Scary? Creepy in parts, but the "shocks" are badly edited, and only one (out of 4 or 5) actually work. Even the infamous death scenes are pale compared to the original (although the beheading is well made). Also, it's virtually a shot-for-shot remake so it feels boring if you've already seen the original.It fails due to 3 (important) factors: the lead casting is unsympathetic; the score is nowhere near as effective as the original, and the direction and pace are just WRONG - has the director even SEEN a thriller/horror film? Anyway, that's just my view (along with the rest of the audience at this particular screening) - see it for yourself if you must - but I'm going to watch the original tonight to see how a REAL classic should be made (something the director of the remake should have done)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>outstanding horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this last night. I'm very surprised this film only has a 5.5 rating on the IMDb. I thought it was just terrific...and I tend to be a pretty harsh critic of horror movies in general (reference my recent review for "An American Haunting").Must confess, I never saw the original of The Omen. Maybe that is why the remake us not rated more highly -- people are comparing it to their memories of an original I have not seen. But I found the 2006 version to be a really terrific film. Excellent and intelligent script, great acting from a top-notch cast, a film that never cops out with the cheap and easy kind of scare. Intelligent scares are much creepier...and boy does this movie deliver! One caution: this is not a "feel good" kind of movie. If you only like that sort of production, then avoid The Omen at all costs. But this movie is very good at being creepy and disturbing and raising some genuine gooseflesh.Here is somewhat of a rarity in horror films: a movie that is beautifully shot, with an interesting and intelligent script, and a top-notch cast who plays it straight and never once feels the need to "wink" knowingly at the audience.The Omen offers a dark, disturbing, gripping two hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, I was extremely nervous about this remake, because The Omen didn't need to be remade, it was a great film. But my friends and I were still interested to see what they changed or destroyed. You know what? It was actually a good film. First with the casting, Julia Styles? I was in deep question because she is still very young and this seemed like a stretch from her teen flick days. She did a great job as a mother and the victim of the story. Her nightmare sequences were terrifying. Liev also did not as well, but a decent performance, especially at the end of the film. Damien, that kid has two lines in the film, but what a presence! You know what? He was scarier than the original Damien. Mia Farrow played an awesome nanny from Hell, she was so disturbingly sweet.Although there were a few things I would have done a little different still, I think this was a decent remake. Some sequences that were a little more intense than the original, which I enjoyed. But also some characters seemed to quickly jump out. The deaths were also a little more elaborate than the original, which I disagreed with because I think if this was true, come on. The Devil could have been a little more subtle with his presence. But still give this flick a chance, it's a good movie.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a return to old fashion horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Vatican has just interpreted the last sign of the impending apocalypse; a comet falling from the sky. On this night, the son of the anti-Christ is born. In Rome, Robert Thorn's wife Katherine has just given birth. During the delivery complication arose and unbeknown to Katherine that she lost the baby. In the same hour another baby was born, with the mother dying during the delivery. Robert takes this baby and raises it as his own; keeping the paternity from Katherine. Five years later, Robert is ambassador for Britain and the family is at its happiest. At Damien's fifth birthday party, the current nanny hangs herself from the roof; screaming her death is for Damien. Soon strange things start happening around Damien. Robert is approached by Father Brennan, claiming that Robert's son is the anti-Christ and has to be killed. Robert doesn't believe this to be true, though as time passes and the strange coincidences stack up, Robert believes that he and Katherine are in danger from their son.Once again, the screens are graced by yet another remake of a classic horror film. Though the pressing question is does this remake fall into the pit of despair that so many of the other remakes have fallen in to? Surprisingly The Omen just survives this fate. With all the current disaster's of recent time; 9/11, earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, etc, writer David Seltzer has cleverly used these as a means of the plots device claiming the Apocalypse is nigh; especially on it's release date 6/6/06; coincidence or clever marketing.This version of The Omen is a trek back to basic horror, implementing mood, tension and foreboding atmosphere. The recent trend of many horror films has been on the amount of violence you can through at your audience, so it's refreshing and gratifying that director John Moore has returned to this style. Disappointing this tension isn't kept at the same level for the entirety of the film. The beginning is choppy with some awkward directing and editing, which lessening the first lot of scares. The Omen takes it's time to build, trying to find its footings, but really comes together mid point onwards.The amount of violence and noise scares are used quite minimally, though very effective when used. What made the original Omen so interesting is that director Richard Donner took away the safety net of the three second look away. He found that during the scare, people would look away for three seconds, to find the dead body to be gone when they look back at the screen. Brilliantly Richard extended the scare time, so when people's eyes returned to the screen, they were surprised to see the decapitated head still rolling in the air. John Moore has taken this approach in this version, but it's not as effective, though it's pleasant that he takes a subtle approach to the violence, instead of throwing it everywhere.Liev Schreiber is strong as Robert Thorn, yet doesn't have that commanding presence as Gregory Peck. Julia Stiles didn't seem that convincing as Katherine, with a sub standard performance. Pete Postlethwaite comes off pedantic as Father Brennan. David Thewlis is strong, keeping his role simple and not over acting. The real surprise is from Mia Farrow. It's such a delight watching her; since she knows what it's like to raise the son of the devil.The Omen has it's problems and flaws, but it's so much better than a lot of the other horror remakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Devil You Say! Better than expected remake of a true occult cult classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE OMEN (2006) *** Liev Schreiber, Julia Stiles, Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick, Mia Farrow, David Thewlis, Pete Postlethwaite, Michael Gambon, Amy Huck, Giovanni Lombardo Radice. Better-than-anticipated remake of the cult occult horror classic about the birth of the Anti-Christ, Damien Thorn (creepy little Davey-Fitzpatrick sportin' a mean scowl and a neo-Moe Howard bowl cut; talk about creepy!), unbeknownst to his loving parents (Schreiber who teeters- towards-irritated brow-kneading until the final act and delivers the anti-hero goods and a wan Stiles), an American diplomat and his wife in Great Britain. More-or-less an amped up sequence-by-sequence reshoot largely due to original film's scribe David Seltzer (adding a few goose-bumps here and there) and director John Moore's lavish production design making up for the all-too familiar for those who've seen it; for those experiencing the ultimate evil consider it in the vein of "Final Destination" meets The Devil. Some jolts thanks to the razor-sharp editing by Dan Zimmerman in spite of the headache-inducing score by Marco Beltrami. Nice touch of red sprinkled crimson throughout by production designer Patrick Lumb and stunt-casting of Farrow - the real mother of another Satanic off-spring in "Rosemary's Baby" - as the sweetly sinister nanny from Hell makes things lively giddy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just came home after seeing this abomination called a movie and frankly it didn't even come near it's predecessor...*Technical Aspect*The camera was absolutely horrible! I haven't seen such shitty camera works in a very long time! While standing still, it was obvious that a hand was shaking, while running it was shaking as well but this time like an earthquake... Totally inappropriate for any movie... 3/10*Script Aspect*The script was awful... Just looking at the dialogue made me sick to my stomach... It actually was boring to listen to the dialogue! 4/10*Acting Aspect*Wow, I didn't realize anyone could act like wooden dolls... It was like watching a puppet show, by far sad to be called! Example on how it would have looked if this would have been a dialogue: Man: Madame, your husband has a deadly disease Ms Pontiac: Oh no... *sniffing for 3 seconds and done move on...* It was just terrible to watch, no feelings, no emotions, nothing! 1/10*Casting*Julia Stiles and Liev Schreiber, I already had my doubts about it but this was far worse! Actually to be honest except for Giovanni Lombardo Radice and David Thewlis no one else did really show the essence of any character... 2/10*Storyboard Aspect*It was almost the same storyboard as the original but they had changed a few things, this was what the director told everyone... Well let me clear things up. First of all this was not looking or feeling anything like the original... The only thing that was the same, was the plot... But how they managed to almost destroy an awesome concept with such power, is still a miracle.... It was boring and never did you get frightened at any point. Just 2 points where you would get scared for no reason at all... 2/10*Soundtrack Aspect*I'm amazed! They used great symphony's on such WRONG moments! Like using scary music for a car that drives by, which is totally irrelevant... Using an awfully sad melody for something not sad at all... This did not help the movie anyway, it actually disturbed me after a while! 1/10*Final Thoughts* If you liked the original, stay far away from this movie. This movie does not come near the original, it only implies to do so... Sad but true even people that haven't seen the original or don't like it, still stay away the movie sucks... You think you'll see excitement no, you will get bored to death and then it ends... Just keep your money and when the movie finally comes on TV, watch it so you won't be sorry!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Critics usually complain about a remake if it's too different from the original or if it's too similar. It's hard to please such high expectations, but I think The Omen succeeded in taking the old while adding some new stuff to keep the fans of the original happy. No one can complain about the script, because the same person that wrote the original wrote this one, which is a plus. And director John Moore left nothing to be questioned, left no doubts as to how someone got here or there or why they would be there in the first place. Instead, it makes you genuinely feel for this family, and the acting (mostly Liev Schreiber's) makes the story feel as realistic as it can possibly be.</fullReview>

And the movie seemed to use Final destination kill tactics which made the movie even more laughable. The movie only makes you jump a few times at best due to tradition pop out of no where with loud noise tactics. I felt it was very under developed story wise just didn't feel enough was there and the kid should have been much more scarier . I recommend saving this for a rental if that.

		<shortDescription>stands well on its own merit ,nearly as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>after finally seeing the Omen(2006 version)i have to say it is not as bad as i had thought it would be.as the two leads ambassador thorn and his wife,Liev Schrieber and Julia Styles are cast well.however,the child cast as Damien is not so well cast.he is more annoying than terrifying.Mia Farrow is brilliantly cast as the sinister nanny.Pete Postlewaite does quite well as the anguished Father Brennan,and David Thewlis is adequate as reporter Keith Jennings.now to the plot of the film.the movie follows the plot of the 1976 original structurally,with a few minor alteration within its composition.I won't go into all of these differences,but there is one noteworthy change i must mention.the death of Mrs Thorn is done in a much more subtle way than the original.this scene may be the one aspect of the remake that is superior to the original.it does retain much of the original Jerry Goldsmith music,which of course elevates its fright factor. as a stand alone movie,it is at times very effective and quite well done.as a remake it is nearly equal to the original. 8* out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror mixed with nostalgia?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FIRST IMPRESSIONS:I saw the original Omen when I was about 10. Being over 30, I still remember it!!! The funny thing is that this remake made me suffer? I was even under the grip of it all the way! OK, I get scared with horror movies. And I did my "homework": watched it alone, on a foggy BA night, sat at the loneliest place of the cinema and went in an awkward time so that NOBODY would spoil me the fun of ? getting scared to death :)!!Let's start by the beginning: this is the best "religious horror" film I've ever seen! I also liked Stigmata (knowing it was far more commercial) and the famous "The exorcist", which even in its revamped version didn't get much of me. Exorcist: The Beginning was OK but... just incomparable to this MASTERPIECE. The Omen is as central to this genre of films as? The Godfather to films in general!!ACTING:Lieb Schreiber is a great actor, he doesn't overdo any single scene; the film is basically carried by him. Visually, there's an air of his directorial debut "Everything is illuminated" (2005) when they tour Italy in search of the truth, but the tone is definitely more sombre! Julia Stiles has the kind of sexless, "noseless" and elegant beauty becoming for a diplomat of high rank (and a president's daughter, to boot!). My favourite is Mia FARROW as the unpretentious Mrs. Baylock. How not to be taken in by such motherly love and selfless duty? OK, her character could be a bit more developed, but she is genuinely FEARSOME? I think I'm gonna have nightmares with her as a nanny : )!"Amy Huck", their first nanny, is a hidden gem of "character composition". Just two sentences and one lost regard let us anticipate? The casting is perfect (Susie Figgis)! And the unlikely director of this orchestra is Moore.I think that the original Damien, "Harvey Stephens" has a meaner look in his green eyes that makes him far better than his replacement. More nuanced, "British", and perverse. I've just read on IMDb that he had a small role in this sequel, cool!"Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick"? I could even agree with the extremist view of MICHAEL ACUNA (Glendale, California): "woefully miscast anti-Christ Damien of Fitzpatrick. And when the child of the Devil is boring in a film about itself, what have we got?" Also agree with Culbertson from Osaka: "looks more like he is spoiled than scary".OTHER REVIEWERS: Amazon's Jeff Shannon says it better than me: "At a time when graphic gore had yet to dominate the horror genre, this film used its violence discreetly and to great effect, and the mood of dread and potential death is masterfully maintained" (he writes about the original version). IMDb reviewer David Duncan from Australia says that it lacks? "sense of foreboding". Not only I DO find it, I think it's the key of the film! NOT "the scares", specially the effective nightmares. For that there are many more "specialized" films, most of them nameless gore alla Tarantino. MY TAKE:On a personal level, this film meant a lot to me. Maybe because I looked alike the original Damien (1976 version) when I was a child. So it was told by my cousins! I haven't checked under my hair for "666" birthmarks :)!I feel there must be something in that well told tale of Catholicism that makes ground for such creepy horror films, but I won't explore that idea for many reasons!!The pivotal moment is in Italy, when Robert screams "There's nothing, only here, and life" and then?How could we even compare all the current manufactured "blood spitting films" with this deeply moving human account of a man who had it all, and then it had nothing less that the most gruesome task ahead? Maybe it's a generational thing, I felt horror physically when I saw the original movie (kids were much more innocent in the mid 80s). And 15 years is enough time to have forgotten basically all about the film (hey, I didn't even remembered how it ended!).But, somehow, the creepy eerie foreboding remains. Concretely, when I saw the beginning of the "big scenes", I couldn't help but recognize them. Even probably know how they would scare me? and I enjoyed every moment of it!!Many scenes are classics, and music (M. Beltrami) does its job very well. I'll never see this kind of flat bikes children use without remorse, the same goes for rottweilers and black dogs in general. And I wouldn't mind not stepping into churches or getting in contact with priests for a while either :) !The scene at the cemetery exposes ourselves with our basic fear of death; the one of the zoo, fear of beasts (but the original was better); the party in the beginning, how bad can things get in a public place. (I don't incur into SPOILERS, like many others reviewers do? (ie F. Nores in the original)). Cinematography (J. Sela) and editing are what makes this film stand the test of time. Details are of the essence: I'll just mention the warning skull when Robert enters the hospital, and the bathroom scene with Katherine looking like, yes, Christ over a minimalist cross. Speaking of minimalism, the shrink's consulting room is church-like and dreamy! I want to do therapy with this room :)!CONCLUSION: I LOVED this film, but understand that other people may watch this "rationally" and feel it's below par. How many films of the hundreds one watches stay in our memory for 15 years? This one worked for me! Were 1/5 of the films I watch so moving, I would try to spend the rest of my life watching films and writing reviews like this one, listening to baroque music of course :) !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good remake, strange locations......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the original Omen trilogy and read the six Omen books as the story carried on with Damien's offspring, so i was intrigued to watch the new film. I decided to see this film and was surprised by how good i thought it was. Sure its the same story but it has been updated and obviously more special effects have been used.My only complaint was some of the locations, as most of the filming was completed in Prague, the filmmakers tried to pass this off as London which was wrong by the architecture of the buildings etc.Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles who played the Thorn couple were more plausible than the older Lee Remick and Gregory Peck from the original. The young actor who played Damien was more convincing considering this was his first major film. The best performance was Pete Postlethwaite as Father Brennan, it would have been good to see more of Michael Gambon as Bugenhagen as his screen time was far too brief.Purists will always compare this to the original, as to whether Omen 2 gets remade will depend on the success of this film for Fox studios.Worst horror remakes have been made in the past few years than this, all in all a good effort which Omen and suspense fans should enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mea culpa. I may be one of the few people on the planet who hasn't seen the original film, though that won't remain the case for long. Because the comparisons are inevitable, I'll have to make mine in reverse order, but for now I'll have to say that "The Omen" succeeds as a patently scary film, and decidedly superior to a lot of what passes for over the top in horror today.The part of Mrs. Baylock was a casting coup for the film, Mia Farrow handled it with such delicious intent. I would have gotten a bigger kick however if the name of Rosemary had come out of her resume. The hospital scene featured her in full malevolent glory, earning her the title of apostate from hell. I also found it intriguing the way she fed young Damien his dessert, sort of a strawberry communion; did anyone else make that connection?I generally don't fall for the jump scenes but this one had me going a few times. It helped that the attendant volume often approached blast level, thereby adding to the effect, but I would have liked to give it a try a little more subdued at times.Hey, did you think "The Shining" when little Damien made his appearance on the tricycle on the hard wood hallways? It seems to me that Kate Thorn (Julia Stiles) could have found a safer way to water that plant.I caught a mini TV documentary on the casting of the movie and found it interesting that Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick literally beat out a field of a couple thousand to earn the Damien role. Down to the final two he nailed it in a screen test with that dourly menacing look throughout the story, capping it off with the smile to the viewer at the very end. But for my money, the most demonic look of all seemed to be the one on Liev Schreiber's face throughout the picture.One last note, a number of reviewers on this site mention Hurricane Katrina as one of the modern disasters shown as a precursor to the arrival of the anti-Christ. Sorry folks, that was the tsunami tidal wave that hit Sri Lanka.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the remake of the Omen last night and wasn't sure what to expect after reading mixed reviews.I usually judge a movie by what I see and not what others say about it. I watched the original a few nights before viewing this new one and have to say(this may annoy die hard fans of the original)that I loved the remake.I thought it was equally as good as the original. I am planning on seeing it again soon. The dark atmosphere throughout the film was nice and chilling and the rainstorms were great.A lot of the scenes were similar to the original but updated, and the performances very realistic.The death scenes like the nanny hanging herself,Jennings decapitation,and Father Brennnan feeling the power of Damien's evil right through his chest was brilliant.Even though I knew what to expect,it was done so real looking that it must have spooked newcomer's who hadn't seen the original. The only problems I had with the film were the character Bugenhagen(i think that was his name)towards the end.The man who gave Robert Thorne the weapons to stab and kill Damien.The actor who played him was good but the portrayal was too comical.People in the audience laughed and that annoyed me.This could have been done better like in the original.And the other thing I didn't care for(although not too important) were the phony sounding English accent by some of the actors playing characters like the psychiatrist,and Kathy's nurse for example. I read that the producer was wanting to make the accent in some of the characters sound authentic English since the movie wasn't shot in London but based in it.However,this is minor and doesn't ruin the movie.On that note,what a beautiful place Prague is.A great spot to film the movie. There were some missing scenes that I remember from the trailer.I hope they will be in the DVD if there is a director's cut.Or added as deleted scenes. All in all,I was very impressed how well the production turned out considering how rushed it was to be done in time for the June 6th release date.I have been following the interesting story since I first read about a remake of it.John Moore had a vision about this remake,and hats off to him for successfully making a very decent remake of a classic. I recommend this film.I think most horror fans will enjoy it.The experience has to be in the theater to get the most out of the special effects and sound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you totally ignore the fact that this movie is a remake or if you've never seen the original, this is a pretty good movie. It isn't overly scary however there are a few points that get the crowd to jump, but at the same time, they are cheap scares like you see in some many of the movies today. These are well placed jump outs that fit the movie well. If you are a big fan of death scenes, this movie is awesome. Every time someone is killed or injured in the movie, they show the whole thing. The never cut a away during a decapitation or a goring, and yet it still looks real. That in itself is unbelievable. The story line for the movie works very well, granted it is the writer's second shot at it and it should be flawless. The acting in it isn't the greatest as the character development and chemistry isn't all the way there, but if you think about it, the acting in the movie 'Saw' was utterly terrible and that can be said to be one of the best horror/suspense movies in the last 10 years. And for those people that didn't like the movie because of the end, all I have to say is every movie can't end how you want it and I think it is better when the good don't always win. It is more realistic that way than if the good guys always succeed. Not to mention changing the ending would change the whole movie. I believe this is how remakes should be made. Don't change a whole lot (especially to the classics). Just use the updated technology that we have today to make the scenes look better and more realistic but leave the story lines, which made the movie what it was, the same. If you are considering watching this movie, I highly would recommend you go see it. If you have any interest, I would say it's worth it. Ignore all the people that gave this movie a '1' because those ratings are ridiculous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most shocking remake this year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About 2 hour ago I watched this movie and I be schoked. I never been saw this movie original version, but remake makes me pop-eyed. Actors do a great job making this movie, because time is running faster and we can't feel entertained with old versions, so remake makes ideas be brand new. Damien acting good, but not that great, than he's father and mother. About 70% movie time was not with Damien, but this is a good choice, because when you show one person in all movie, you will get bored. Priests make up's was very detailed and original. Makes you feel like in the movie and it's very good movies side. I went to this film, because I thought it is scarier, but it's not. It is more than scarier. Now I actually understand what is A REAL horror movie.My rating of this movie - 8/10"The Omen 666" is most shocking remake this year!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is rare for a remake to be better than the original but the shiny new version of The Omen is superior. I loved the 1976 Richard Donner film but John Moore has crafted a superb chiller with a great new cast led by Liev Schreiber as Robert Thorn and a stunning debut by Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick as Damien. Me and my friends were on the edge of our seats throughout and 10/10 is a worthy score, as was the musical score, 1st Class. The rest of the cast which includes David Thewlis as Photographer Jennings and Mia Farrow as Mrs Baylock, Julie Stiles as Kathy Thorn all give excellent performances. Go see this if you haven't already. There will not be a better chiller thriller this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I briefly browsed through the postings for The Omen on the IMDb and noticed that someone had started a line of postings about strange occurrences on 6/6/06. I have one for you, although mine is more disappointing than strange. I go to the Marina Cinema in Marina del Rey, right by where I live, and I arrive minutes before screen time, walk around the corner and find a massive line for the ticket booth. Seconds from giving up and going home, I decide to stay in line because the whole reason I came to the movies on a Tuesday by myself after work was because I wanted the ticket stub for The Omen dated 6/6/06, so I stay in line. The line goes fast enough so that I get through in time enough even to stop and buy popcorn and a coke, the dietary supplement that I am by now convinced will eventually kill me, and walk into the theater. The lady tears my ticket, says "The Omen, Theater 2," and I'm on my way. I thoroughly enjoy the movie, and as I leave the theater with a smile on my face, I take my ticket out of my pocket, having not even looked at it since I purchased it, and as I look down to see how prominent the movie title and the date are displayed, I stop in shock as I read:Marina Unit 2418PresentingBREAK-UP-THE4:10PM TUE 6/6/06Aud #1I stop in my tracks in dismay, unfortunately in the middle of the street, and get honked at by the passing car that almost hits me. At least they got the date right?Getting to the movie, I was surprised at how good it was, because it could so easily have been watered down, or have had the satanic element wildly exaggerated to appease the goofy teenage goth crowd that surrounded and horrendously irritated me throughout the film (I was lucky enough to sit right in front of the one jerkoff who burst out into hysterical laughter every time Damien was on screen, an excellent way to summarily ruin the movie). Live Schreiber gives an outstanding performance as Robert Thorn, an up and coming young American Ambassador, surpassed perhaps only by Julia Stiles, whose portrayal of his increasingly disturbed wife is at once maternally comforting, subsequently unsettling and astonishingly accurate throughout. Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick delivers an incredible performance as the satanic title character. In some scenes he is nothing short of frightening, such as when he is making a sandwich in the middle of the night and stares motionless at his awoken and inquisitive mother. At other times, however, the grimaces that he gives bring to my mind the image of the director behind the camera telling him to make a real, real mean face. Then again, that impression could very well have been inspired by that idiot behind me, laughing in my ear. I found some of the film to be a bit talky and slow, but it maintains a creepiness throughout and has some outstanding shocks, which is one of the areas that a movie like this is most likely to screw up, because the audience walks into the auditorium expecting and watching for them, and it is so hard to come up with something original. Remember the girl getting hit by the bus in Final Destination? That is an example of originality. If there was a screeching cat in this movie it would have been a struggle for me to resist walking out of the theater, but the scares were plenty and they were effective. I have to say that I found it a bit odd to see the Italian priest at the beginning of the film giving a lecture about what he believed signaled the coming of the Antichrist, since it was inter cut with a lot of American tragedies. But no matter, the film was well made, the performances were spot on, and it was faithful to the original without being a simple re- shooting, as was famously the case with the Psycho re-make.. It's easy to immediately condemn a re-make of any kind as teetering on the verge of insulting the integrity and sanctity of the original, but given the sheer onslaught of remakes that are pouring out of Hollywood these days, I find myself pretty thankful to see one as faithful, yet original, as this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The primary reason being the boom Mic... it was in almost every shot. The Mic should have its' own credit. I also believe I saw a fill light in the corner one of the scenes. Also the pathetic attempt to create drama with the sad little actor never speaking and being all fake creepy was just sad. I do not see how they could have got this movie out. It is sickening what passes for even studio garbage these days. I also do not like Julia Stiles, but that was the least of my worries. If you haven't seen it yet do not give them any money for this. I saw it as a favor to my sister and she apologized. I think we deserve an apology or at least some explanation on why so many mistakes were left into this poorly edited garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was among those who watched The Omen (2006) on 6/6/06. Firstly, I must say that I have not seen the entire film of the original, but the person I went with had seen it at least a dozen times (she assured me). According to her, the script was practically word for word, but the visual aspects of the film did not illicit a reaction as they do in the newest edition of The Omen. Secondly, I, unlike some other reviewers, did not leave the theater, but was riveted. I was stuck to my seat...until it came to a point to jump. They throw something at you when you're least expecting it with this film, and I enjoyed it immensely... especially because I haven't jumped during a movie since Arachniphobia (when I was 10 years old). The little boy who played Damien didn't look demonic all on his own, that is true, but he definitely looked like a normal little boy. I mean really, if Satan is the Prince of Darkness and of Lies, shouldn't his spawn be able to aptly appear "normal"... as the movie goes on, he does get creepier and creepier, not in appearance, but in actions. Such as it is, I can understand how the parents of this particular little boy would be confused as to the goings on around them. Lastly, it's a freakin' movie. This is not a profound, soul-searching tear-jerker. If that is what you are looking for, be prepared to walk out. The Omen was, however, intense, and really did it's job, which was scaring the audience. (The audience I viewed the movie with were all happy with it from what I gathered when walking out.) Go see this, or if you do not like the theater's prices, rent this beast and watch it in the dark with someone who likes scary movies as much as you do!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has all the ingredients for a successful horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen (2006) is a horror film that stands out among the rest. It's not perfect - it's slow in points, sometimes laughable, and Julia Stiles is not the best actress.I've seen the original, but it was such a long time ago that all I remember are the violent scenes. I don't remember particularly liking it, in fact, I may have fallen asleep (this was around 3 a.m., however).Before this movie and certain others I've watched recently I despised "jump" scares. I thought they required no skill in scaring the viewer. But in fact they can be used very effectively, it's just that most horror movies perform them miserably. They're used to give you a taste of the shock that the character is going through. It works in The Omen because it has a good, involving story. You get sucked in, thus the startling scenes are all the more effective. This movie has by far the two best jump scares I've ever seen. I almost never fall for them - I've been startled a couple times, but in this movie I actually felt terror. I literally jumped in my seat and yelled. I haven't had that good of an adrenaline rush in a long time - very satisfying. In another scene involving a bathroom mirror the theater literally shook with all the people leaping in their chairs and shrieking.The things that made this movie scary are these: -The use of nightmares. The only other movies I can think of that realistically portray nightmares are The Exorcist, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and Jacob's Ladder.-Restraint. One scene takes place in a zoo. The apes go bananas when they see Damien, pounding the glass until it cracks. Schoolchildren run and scream in fear. The scene ends, leaving you to imagine what hell would've broken loose had the apes escaped.-I've always thought hangings are disturbing. There's a good one in here.-Freak accidents ala Final Destination. These are scary because they happen in real life. The idea that something intangible is at work trying to kill you and there is no escape is unsettling. In one scene a man is decapitated and his headless corpse is left standing for a few seconds before tumbling headless over heels down a set of stairs. These scenes are even more shocking when they happen in broad daylight in front of large groups of people (perhaps a football arena that catches fire?) Plus the cinematography is good. I can't believe this only has a 5.3 on IMDb and also bad reviews on rotten tomatoes. See it wanting to have a good time and get scared.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film more than any I've seen this year. This film is certainly superior to the original, albeit highly derivative in script and dialogue. What this film has the original didn't is a great sense of style. The use of the color red. The overall pacing of the film. The suspension of villains until the very last possible instant (dogs in graveyard, Mrs. Baylock). This film grabs the viewer like the original could have only dreamed. Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles are strong performers in this film, however, the supporting actors (David Thewlis, Michael Gambon, Pete Posthelwaite, Mia Farrow) deliver the performances that sell the film. The filmmakers made some excellent in choices in the use of sweeping boom shots and a certain darkness that gives the impression that something in the world isn't right. Go see it, see it ten times. I think this film should be nominated for best picture. Dig it.</fullReview>

It is not like I am trashing the original. I respect it and people involved, but the fact is the remake is more exciting and well paced. It also has exceptional cinematography and art direction. I applaud everyone who worked on the technical side of the movie.Talking about the cast, what's the big deal about Julia Styles? Hate towards her reminds me of Michael Bay situation that I can't understand also. Anyway, all the actors are solid. Esp, David Tewlis and Mia Farrow.And no, it is not a shot-by-shot remake. The concept is, the director shot a certain scene as if he was told: "Here you'll have Kate Torn knocked down by Damien and falling" or "Here you'll have the photographer being decapitated". It feels like Moore didn't watch the original (he saw it, of course) and that kind of approach I just dig.Overall, the movie exceeded my expectations and goes #1 on my "favourite movies of 2006" list. 10/10</fullReview>

The acting is terrific, especially of the main character. I guess the only thing that could have been made better about the movie ? is the plot: the movie lasts little under two hours, yet another 30 minutes of pure cinematic pleasure would not have hurt the public's pure feelings and will to see more of the typical Hitchhock's approach to making a good horror movie! A must see. Really! Even those who do not appreciate horror movies, yet are in love with top-notch sceneries and well set-up scenes will love some scenes for the pick of colors, clothing, music and careful acting.</fullReview>

The most sinister of all was Damien's mother's death, it was really chilling and did make me squirm, as did the death of the photographer, that really shocked me and i wasn't expecting that one bit! It was cleverly shot, and felt very, very real. However i have not seen the original Omen, so i can't compare, but i really, really loved this movie, and you should all go and see it!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had recently watched The Omen and I must say it is really quite an enjoyable spook fest.Acting was done pretty well by the main leads.Mia Farrow did awesome.The kid whom played Damien was pretty effective in looking creepy (though not all the time).This movie was indeed quite creepy and keeps the viewer interested throughout.I must say that this was one of the few movies that made audience scream instead of laugh in the cinemas!Overall,i think those who haven't watched the original Omen will probably enjoy this more than those who have....But even those who have watched the original will probably be pleased about this remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Omen is a thriller more than a horror, but it certainly makes you jump at times. I saw it last week at a 20th Century Fox press preview in London. My official published version is appearing around the city as I write. I really wasn't very impressed with Julia Stiles, but the rest of the cast equipped themselves well. What I do find frustrating is the way filmmakers play hard and fast with geographical realism. It was quite obvious very early on that we weren't watching London, even though the London Eye and Big Ben had been CGIed in here and there. What disappointed me the most on this front was no effort being made to cover up Czech shop signs in the closing scenes. If this was filmed completely on a lot, then there would have been more realism. The general street scenes passed for Britain, but come on.. it's not that difficult to change a few signs. It spoilt it for me.I've never seen the original so had nothing to compare it with. It's run of the mill stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film fails miserably in evoking the emotions and fears of the original and the fault for this lies everywhere, in nearly every frame of the film...and squarely on the shoulders of an inept director who, it seems, has never watched a horror film in his life.It gets an extra star from me because Liev Schreiber was really quite good as Robert Thorn. Otherwise, the film felt overwrought with extremely tired horror film clichés and a score that certainly left something to be desired in spite of my opinion that Marco Beltrami is normally a better composer than this...if not entirely original either.I think that's the fault of remakes...they're not original and yet audiences pay for insipid messes like this therefore more insipid messes are made and whoever gave the green light on these ill-conceived projects gets a pat on the back.Do yourself a favour: go watch the original again. This film isn't fit to share the name of the first three...in point of fact, this film might rank right down on the list with the fourth Omen movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Omen remake better than the original???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish we lived in a world where HOLLY WOOD still had some original ideas instead of a constant flow of remakes.But, alas we do not live in that world.With almost every single moving coming out these days being a remake, we do have to remember, we are catering to a new generation of movie goers.YES it's hard to remake a classic that can impress the older fans or new found fans of the original. Such as, THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, PSYCHO, AMITYVILLE HORROR etc.. ( I could go on since the list is unending) but you get the picture.You have to remember there are those who don't even realize that these movie are remakes. I realized this when I recently watched THE OMEN and at the end heard at leas three people say to their dates "THERE'S GONNA BE ANOTHER ONE!" THE OMEN is one of those classics that shouldn't have been redone (or that was my opinion when I went into the theater).This remake was done so closely to the original it seemed more like a TRIBUTE to me than a remake. The PLUS to this movie was that it moved a lot faster. This is a definite improvement. I loved the original, but I think I like this one much better.It's definitely the better version for the modern movie goer to go watch.. and if you're a fan of the original please keep an open mind. All the scenes you loved from the original are still in this one and equally as interesting. Dare I say done even better.You won't be disappointed.What I did find disturbing was the fact that before the movie there was a TRAILER for THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE THE BEGINNING a SEQUEL/PREQUEL to the REMAKE of the original Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE. It's sad that the remakes are requiring SEQUELS these days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a novelty - a remake that actually surpassed the original! This film pulls no tricks with the audience and builds a genuine ominous tension from the opening scenes. It also utilizes some magnificent imagery, and a stellar cast. Unfortunately, it is not without mistakes.Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber) does not seem to be upset for himself that his infant son dies. So when he cries over his grave, I have very little sympathy for him. So shame on the director for accepting it! The character undertakes a truly extra-ordinary act by switching the infants. But the only reason we are given is that, "This child meant everything..." to his wife. WHY? In the original, we did not have to be told. It was a much older couple and the biological clock was ticking. The original also clearly pointed out that the Thorns had discussed adoption, and the wife was adamant against it. This was also left out of the remake, so we also do not understand why he can never tell his wife, or even ask her in the first place. I blame the screenwriter for this one. And it should not have been that difficult since at least 85% of the script is the original script.What IS a vast improvement is the very short but powerful additional scenes helping the audience understand why Kathy Thorn is becoming unhinged. (Mia Farrow as the second nanny is much more intriguing!) But both versions drop the ball by NOT depicting anything unusual before Damien's fifth birthday.What a shame these mistakes were made. Without them, this would have been the definitive version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler!!I rented the original first, before I watched the remake. I suggest not doing this! The story is so good the makers could not change too much, and I would say watching one spoils the other. The directing and camera equipment are far superior to the 1976 version. The atmosphere was great. The icy ground at the coffee shop before the protagonist finds the truth at the cemetery resonates the harsh atmosphere of evil! No one can out preform Gregory Peck for acting, but Liev Scrieber plays a good role of any character in a suit. One question why did the makers use a black German shepherd instead of a rottie for the one scene? The young Damian is better than the original for the remake shows Damian causing fear amongst his fellow man, and the tormenting of his step mother. I just wish, I did not rent the original first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Omen was a very good movie. The only sort of disappointing thing is that they didn't show Damien as much as they should have. He didn't talk much, but then again he didn't in the original either. The only differences are small ones, such as deaths. The first nanny that hung herself. She, in the original fell, snapped her neck, then hit a window. There was no window in this one. Then when it comes to the mother, Katherine. she fell from a window in the original but died from Mrs. Baylock injecting the tube with air in the new one. Still though, minus the small details it is almost the exact same movie, just better effects. But it is still a movie that is guaranteed to frighten, and keep you guessing and wanting more, and has, in my opinion, one of the best endings to any movie, and I have seen a lot of them. All in all, it is a great movie.</fullReview>

In those two deaths you could hear "OH MY god" and gasps throughout the theater. No wine involved for blood in this movie! 2) No one was expecting Mia to pop up after Thorn cuts off Damien's hair... everyone was jumping.. Then they laughed because they felt stupid. After that when she gets hit by the car everyone was clapping because they felt that she deserved to die. 3) Did you see Harvey's small but tasteful line.. it went to quickly to get what he was saying... but I was a good line.. That thorn didn't answer. 4) For all the people who didn't see the original... you get a better explanation than they did in the original. 5) Many may argue but the kids smile at the end was priceless... it was great. 6) Tons of the parts of movie was well directed and produced... they thought of may ways to make the camera jiggle to make it even scarier.I can't believe I'm saying this... but it is better than the original. It never leaves you unexcited... ... don't bring anyone under 8 to this movie... ha ha I was sitting next to this 7 year old and he was screaming is head out when the pole went through Brennan's body.

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was going to be bad.Like really bad. Nothing can beat the original. But... to tell you the truth... I felt like it was almost to the point of doing so. This was more of a thriller/suspense movie than horror.The only problem with this movie was that it stayed to loyal to the original and didn't add in much of its own touch. It wasn't bad, but what made people scared in the original doesn't have the same effect on us today. It did do its job and it did the original much justice. Liev Schreiber does a good job. He shows a more sentimental side.I was on the edge of my seat the whole time even though I've seen the original but I'd forgotten a lot of little things. Julia Stiles starts off a little stale but she soon starts to take a serious toll and proves she can act very well. Damien (seamus) is pretty good. He got on my nerves a little, but he's one scary little bastard. All in all, I enjoyed this movie. It's stylish, loyal to the remake (too loyal ),gets intense, and the death scenes were very well done. I do suggest it more to people who haven't seen the original, because since it stays so close, it's pretty much the same. Religious people beware!Remember this, it's much more of an effective thriller than horror. And it's a lot more graphic than the original. Sit tight, grab on, and enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original OMEN, so I can't say whether the remake was better than it, but I think the remake is purely excellent. The whole movie is just terrifying - and it has an excellent plot. I truly enjoyed this movie and is one of my favorite horror movies ever.The characters were great - especially Damien - the actor who played his role did an excellent job.The Omen (2006) is about a boy who is possessed. He starts to do evil things and the parents start to realize this. The father (a rich diplomat) ends up working with this photographer to try and find out more. It ends up with the possessed child "Damien" still being possessed and the father being captured by the police for attempting to kill the son. Then the president decides to adopt the son (who is still possessed - though the president doesn't know that).The ending is great because it leaves you in suspense and mystery - wondering what is going to happen to the president.A truly excellent movie that I certainly recommend to horror movie fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A not-so-interesting clone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a movie buff, I can say that my greatest pet peeve is people who talk through movies. But, holy cow, I was so bored during this movie that I started cracking jokes and cheering when someone died. Save yourself some money, go to Blockbuster, rent the original, and congratulate yourself on your fiscal responsibility.I had anticipated that this movie was not being remade simply because the date they could release it on was 6/6/06, however, that was apparently an erroneous assumption.The story of "The Omen" is an interesting one, but this version retells the story the same as the '76 version. From what I can remember of the original (it's been 20 years), there's nothing new. There's not even any sexual tension between Julia Stiles and Leiv Schreiber. No pseudo-sex scenes like rolling around half-nude in the bed or watching them bathe each other through the opaque shower doors. That would have been worth something. No one but my 11th grade English teacher would have wanted to see sexual tension between Peck and Remick (she thought Peck was hot).Even when people died in the movie, it wasn't because Damien stared at them until their heads exploded or anything, it was very similar to watching one of the "Final Destination" movies. A seemingly series of innocuous events lead to the shocking death of someone. Of course, the trailers have pretty much removed the shock of one of deaths.Ultimately, this movie is a clone of the original without any real effort put forth to bring a new scare to audiences. Rent the original and then you can be a snob about seeing the original, therefore you snobbishly say, "I don't need to see an unworthy remake."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was invited by Fox Germany to a preview in a cinema in Essen last night, in connection with the annual meeting of the German skeptics society GWUP (some members of which were also included in a panel discussion after the screening). "The Omen" is a remake of the 1976 classic, following practically the same script but with certain updates in details. E.g. major news events of the past few years have been integrated into the pretty gripping opening scenes in 'the Vatican' as evidence for the upcoming apocalypse, and characters, esp. the female lead, have been developed forward into the 21st century. The overall feel of the movie, however, is much like your typical religious horror flick of decades past, with lots of rain, horror effects that are sometimes stark and at times just funny, and a very dark and unreal atmosphere. I must say that I didn't expect much but was positively surprised - my favorite 'paranormal' movie is still 'The Medusa Touch', but this one is well worth your attention. It also provoked me to do some detective work on the location where the very first scene (with a 'Vatican astronomer' at an old-fashioned telescope) was shot: Since the press material said that nearly everything was filmed in or around Prague, I checked out pictures of the astronomical institutions there and found the double refractor of Stefanik Observatory above the city a perfect match ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just like putting a shine on the perfect apple. John Moore directs this remake of the 1976 classic starring Gregory Peck and Lee Remick. Same situations with maybe more profound violence. Godson of the President and a recently appointed U.S. foreign diplomat, Robert Thorn(Liev Schreiber), exchanges an orphan for his stillborn baby. Mrs. Thorn(Julia Stiles)gradually begins to notice things are just not right with the young Damien(Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick). Things become a bit grotesque as the nanny commits suicide and is replaced with a mysterious caregiver(Mia Farrow). An observant photographer(David Thewis)convinces Thorn that his child is the son of Satan! My favorite scene is when Thorn meets a priest(Pete Postlethwaite)under a bridge in the rain...right before the later is impaled. Watching the photographer meet his fate is also very graphic. I wish Stiles had more screen time. This remake is really one worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(r#34)This is not so much a movie as it is two hours of boredom spliced with electric shocks to make sure the audience doesn't fall asleep. When an ordinary horror movie is as bland as 2006's "Omen", it's not that much of a disaster. But this is based on what I consider one of the greatest American horrors of all time. A remake this forgettable is insulting to the original movie's legacy.Liev Schreiber isn't necessarily an awful actor, but let's face it, he has NOTHING on Gregory Peck. The casting of Julia Stiles as the wife is just idiotic. Her performance rings false whenever she's supposed to emote, and she, like Liev, comes off as a bore during most of their scenes. Pete Postlethwaite and Michael Gambon ham it up as the wacky priests who are hard to take seriously, while Mia Farrow overacts like hell as the evil nurse. As for Damien himself, well, let's hope Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick never gets another role. He's absolutely awful and his forced attempts at being creepy are just ridiculous. If you think I'm being too hard on the kid, I suggest you check out movies like The Sixth Sense, The Shining, or, hell, even the original "Omen". Now THAT'S good child acting! Moving on: when the hell did "horror" become synonymous with "things that jump at you from behind"? Seriously, this sort of thing isn't scary. Anyone can film a vaguely frightening object, add a deafening noise and cut away quickly. It's not exactly the sort of thing that you'll lose sleep over. I mean, if you've seen that "creepy car commercial", then you've seen this. A very weak film with no atmosphere to speak of, and the fact that it is a remake of one of my favourite films of all time only makes it worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Omen, The (2006) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Decent remake of the classic Gregory Peck film has new parents (Liev Schreiber/Julia Stiles) getting a new son who just happens to be the son of Satan. I think the original film is one of the most chilling ever made with a strange religious nature as well as some unsettling death scenes. This new version is certainly watered down in some aspects but it works quite well up until the ending, which just had to go for a political punch. Why is it Hollywood can't come up with original ideas yet they think they can make the world a better place? Anyways, I've never been a fan of the two leads but they actually deliver fine performances as does David Thewlis and Pete Postlethwaite. Mia Farrow is wasted in a rather silly performance. This certainly doesn't touch the original film but it's better than the sequels and makes for an entertaining 90-minutes.</fullReview>

To find the answer all you have to do is go back to the original movie that started Gregory Peck and Lee Grant. Also the accidents not only on the set for the movie, but in the making of the movie itself. This showed that the Anti-Christ is among us this day, NO I AM NOT A ZEALOT.I am a Christian, and I would not have it in my right mind go to see again the "Accident's" that appear again in this movie. Not only that, I happen to have to mention that when this movie was being filmed, again there were "accidents" both on the making of Omen and on the people of whom were making this movie.So, in the name of the Lord Jesus, please do not let people be overtaken by the same grip of fear that the original Omen did back in 1976.</fullReview>

The rest of the movie is chock full of the jumpy camera work that seems to ruin all horror movies these days, and the relationship between the leads is stiff and formal. Damien at least looks creepy, but really, he doesn't do much. The only actor to stand out is Mia Farrow as the creepy nanny, her acting and the strength of the original concept are the only things that really keep this film going. Other than that, Liev Schrieber's chase for answers is really more "Indiana Jones" than it is scary. It's still not a bad film, just a disappointing one. So if you want to see it, rent it or go to a dollar theater. A cineplex and it's costs are not befitting of this additional unnecessary remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen the original so I have nothing to compare it to. However, I did think that this movie was visually appealing. The thing I liked the most is that the death scenes on this one are all done pretty well.The acting was not all that great. I think it was mediocre. Julia Stiles was not as credible as I liked her to be. The nanny was pretty creepy. The boy that played Damien seemed credible, however, I was not happy with the actor that played as Damien's father, I did not think he was effective at doing his part. The best actor on this film was Damien's first nanny, I thought she played her part really well (but then that part is barely anything).I guess it's because I've seen a lot of horror movies, but I did not think this movie was scary. The mirror scene in Julia's nightmare, I thought was very trite, however, the guy beside me almost fell from his chair! There were two scenes where I was taken by surprise. So besides being startling, I thought that this movie was not scary. I thought mom's and dad's three nightmare scenes were the scariest parts of the movie, the rest (which is a good 90% of the movie) is pretty ordinary.I wish the movie were a little bit scarier in order to go with its release date. I did not think that this movie lived up to its hype, but then again, it might be because I've never seen the original.I wish you all a merry 6/6/06.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>06/06/06 and "The Omen" has been remade. Watching seemed, at the time, the right thing to do. How could they possibly screw this up? Not only do you have a classic horror film that has already proved itself a worthwhile watch but a fairly solid novel as well. But they did friends! And how! Julia Stiles and Liev Schreiber move around the screen with energy of meat marionettes and manage to portray a couple so wooden and unsympathetic that after ten minutes of stifled laughter from myself, all I wanted to see was that little bastard chew their jugulars out and maybe urinate on them a bit. Truth be told, I walked out, bored and irritated. I think if you are casting the "son of Satan" pick a kid who looks a little demonic, not a little sleepy or at worst a little downs syndrome. On top of that, get a scary dog and not a beast that would have looked more at home asleep in it's basket by the fire, and if you must have stunted wooden performances than at least cater to our lust for violence and gore, my case and point, the amazing "maid hanging herself" scene. She bellows from the rooftop "Its all for you Damien" or something like that, she then launches herself off the roof with a noose around her neck and dies. One pregnant pause later and a woman screams. Now stop me if I am wrong but shouldn't something have happened here to keep us interested. My suggestion, streak the walls with the contents of her bowels or perhaps the bowels themselves. No doubt I would have been stunned enough to stay in my seat. I wasn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First thing I should mention about watching this is that I saw on a plane travelling 11 hours to America for what was a brilliant college trip. Second, I knew that this film was never going to beat the original 1976 version, and I was right. When this was released it was not just the 30th Anniversary of the original, but it was out on the 6th of June (6th month) of 2006! Anyway, the story has not made any changes, you still have Robert Thorn (Scream's Liev Schreiber) taking a lone baby, after his own dies. This kid grows into Damien (Seamus Davey-Kirkpatrick), son of the devil, and many bizarre things happen around and during his time, including the hanging babysitter, the protection evil Mrs. Baylock (Rosemary's Baby's Mia Farrow), deadly dogs, raging monkeys (now gorillas behind glass), the death of crazy Father Brennan (Brassed Off's Pete Postlethwaite), and of course, the famous beheading scene for Jennings (Harry Potter's David Thewlis). There are moments where it can be creepy, including the good opening of distinctive moments mentioned in the bible coming true, and using real footage, but ultimately, it is just another typical "not as good as the original" remake. Also starring a brief Sir Michael Gambon as Bugenhagen. Worth watching!</fullReview>
