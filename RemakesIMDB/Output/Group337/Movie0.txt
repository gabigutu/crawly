		<shortDescription>One of the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie plays with the intellect. It is frightening for what is not seen. From the grey overcast that blurs the skies of London and the dead stillness of the great Pereford mansion that houses the ill-fated Thorn family to the deepest recesses of civilization in the hollow underground of an ancient excavation site, the film effectively captures the viewer's interest and draws them into a world that is on the verge of the ultimate disaster - the birth of the anti-Christ.Born into the world of politics and wealth, little Damien Thorn is the darling of the beautiful and privileged Robert and Katherine Thorn. Mysterious accidents and the overall feeling of death begin to shadow their lives until the horrifying truth of Damien's birth is uncovered millions of miles away in a grave in a decaying pagan cemetery in Italy. Gregory Peck gives a fine performance as ambitious politico Robert Thorn, a man who slowly discovers that his fate is interlinked in ancient biblical prophecy. With escalating horror, he uncovers a grand design that's unfolding under the unsuspecting eyes of the entire world - and he and his perfect family are at the centre of it. His search for the truth is one of the best in films, taking him to the farthest reaches of the globe and climaxing in an exciting and bizarre confrontation between himself and the face of evil.Lee Remick is ethereal as his beautiful and tragic wife. The rest of the cast - Billie Whitelaw as the creepy Mrs. Baylock, David Warner as the doomed Jennings and Leo McKern as the mysterious archaeologist Bugenhagen - give the movie its singular dark and moody quality. THE OMEN has a few disturbing moments that shock rather than disgust, but the film is loaded with memorable scenes that are ingenious. It's the 'feeling' that the film incites that makes this movie unique. The haunted performances of the actors, the creepy-crawly musical score, the insinuation that doom is slowly creeping into the world with the birth of one lone child, all succeed in making THE OMEN one of the truest horror films.Sometimes it's the knowing that something is going to happen that is more frightening than actually seeing it happen ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of Scariest Movies Of The Modern Era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie scared the heck out of me when I saw it in the theaters in 1976, and it's still creepy today. It was almost 30 years later when I finally saw it for the second time and I thoroughly enjoyed it again, although it wasn't terrifying to me anymore. The DVD version is excellent because it presents the movie in the 2.35 widescreen mode, which is essential to the viewing of this film if you are a fan of cinematography. A VHS formatted-to-TV picture would lose too much of the great camera-work done in this film. I was amazed how beautifully filmed this movie is, so if you love this film and don't have the DVD, please consider getting it.The story was a bit slower than I remembered it back in '76 but still provides enough action and plenty of chills. This time around, I found the nanny (Billie Whitelaw as "Mrs. Baylock") to be more scary than the devil/kid! I didn't even remember her from 30 years ago but she got my attention on the DVD. It was a very effective job of acting by that woman.In the meantime, I always enjoy looking at Lee Remick's gorgeous face with her magnetic eyes and Gregory Peck is usually rock-solid in roles he plays. This is no exception.Although I question some of the supposed quotes from the Book Of Revelation from the Bible (there is no "s" in Revelation, the screenwriters showing their biblical ignorance.), the movie is still a good witness to people who don't believe in Satan. They might after viewing this movie. This is one of the classics of the '70s and often underrated. The sequels to this were simply not memorable and not worth your time. I don't know about the re- make that just came out, but it would be tough to top this film. I think I'll stick with this one and I won't wait another 30 years to see it again. Maybe tonight!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Thorn the American ambassador to Great Britain watches his wife's pregnancy when a priest tells him that his newborn has died, but he convinces him to substitute the baby (the wife not knowing) with another child that lost its mother in labour at the same time. Watching their young child growing up, he starts show unnerving signs, which the parents slowly start picking up on and also bizarre tragedies start occurring. This leads Robert on a whirlwind investigation that all points to his son being the Anti-Christ.Right off the heals of 'The Exorcist' successful stint with moviegoers comes another one of those endless 70s religious themed horror flicks involving Satanism. 'The Omen', I'd definitely say is one of the better horror films in the shadow of "The Exorcist', but I'll even go to say its an vast improvement over it's influencer. That might be a surprise for some, but I found this film superior as it was more entertaining, fascinating and truly creepy in its context and shocks. Everything about it has a knack for falling into place. From the impending doom that's achieved by its coldly layered atmosphere to a premise that teases the viewer on how it's all going to play out. I won't deny that it seems silly enough when you pay close attention to it all, but with such conviction in the performances and that off confident direction, these factors makes sure that it doesn't slip overboard into cheesy daftness. Another stroke of brilliance would be Jerry Goldsmith's memorably, nerve-wrecking score with those explosive chants scattered throughout.On a grand scale the film was efficiently catered with well established cinematography and polished set-pieces that had penetrating might, which director Richard Donner handled with precise skill. Even when there wasn't much happening he knew how to keep things compellingly tight with good pacing and impressible imagery. Though, when it came to the essential thrills, he caps off some remotely tense (dogs' attack) and macabre moments (infamous decapitation) that display bite and flair. The climax is great and the ending is a fitting imprint too. The plot is filled with shocking revelations, interesting characters and it emits a glorious amount of excitement and dread from it mysterious outset.The performances are that of top quality by a stellar cast. Gregory Peck and Lee Remick are convincingly excellent as Mr and Mrs Thorn. David Warner turns in a marvellous performance as the photographer Keith Jennings. Then Billie Whitelaw is genuinely creepy as Damien's nanny Mrs. Baylock. Patrick Troughton is superb as the withering Father Brennan. But my applause goes to Harvey Stephens' who's the epitome of evil? well; he definitely looked the part and had a memorizing awe as Damien. Although, Peck deserves more credit really, as he brought such devotion to his character that we honestly feel the pain and confusion that hits home.One of the true benchmarks of horror, along the same lines of 'The Exorcist', but for me it beats that film all ends up. Expect a devilishly good time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Satanic schlock.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Omen' scared the bejesus out of me as a kid. Watching it again all these years later much of its impact has worn off, and yes, it has dated quite badly, but it's still a wonderfully entertaining movie, probably second only to Polanski's 'Rosemary's Baby' in the Satanic/apocalyptic genre. It definitely wipes the floor with recent pretenders like 'Lost Souls' and 'End Of Days'.One of the reasons it still works is that the actors take the (sometimes silly) material so seriously. And when you have actors of the calibre of Gregory Peck and David Warner it certainly helps. Peck is utterly convincing as the Ambassador who doesn't want to believe the shocking facts staring him in the face, and Warner, who often found himself in second rate b-grade rubbish, obviously relished his role as the inquisitive reporter who helps convince Peck that things are not as normal as they seem. Along with Peckinpah's 'Cross Of Iron', one of his best roles. Lee Remick is strong as Damien's worried mother, Billie Whitelaw chilling as the mysterious governess, and Patrick Troughton ('Dr Who' #2) is very good as a dying priest who knows the truth about the Thorn's son.Forget the sequels, 'The Omen' is classic Satanic schlock, and still has more than a few scares left in it. Essential viewing for fans of 70s horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kids Can Be Hell.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rightfully tense and spooky thriller from director Richard Donner that grabs its audience and does not let go until the shocking finale. American Ambassador Gregory Peck has come up with an idea after his new-born son dies at birth: he decides to pass another child off to wife Lee Remick as their own. Life in England seems grand for a few years, but as the child becomes a toddler (in the form of the young Harvey Stephens) strange murders start to occur. The child is really the son of Satan, born of a goat, and his only goal is to grow up and take over the world for his unearthly father. As the truth slowly unfolds, the film twists into disturbing murders and highly unholy situations. Not a film for the faint of heart and certainly not a perfect film, but still one of the stronger films of the usually luke-warm genre. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Always avoid people born on the 6th June ? especially if they are called Damien and bizarre violent accidents seem to happen to those around them! Since this film has recently been remade, I thought it would be a good time to look back at the original ? a horror classic!In 1973, 'The Exorcist' broke all boundaries; previously, horror movies had only concentrated on the dark side, there were hardly any references to main stream religions. The basic rule was if the Devil was in it, God wasn't. Even Rosemary's Baby released five years before has hardly any reference to God or a more heavenly supreme being. The reaction that followed the release of The Exorcist was that the public loved it but the censors didn't and it was banned in the UK for twenty five years. The Exorcist may have fallen foul of the censors but it opened the flood gates for this sort of movie and three years later The Omen was released on 06/06/1976.What do you think a good horror movie should have? Is it a superb cast, a brilliant score, a battle of good versus evil artfully portrayed on screen, or maybe a sinister and ambiguous open ending? No matter which of these sways your opinion 'The Omen' has all these and much, much more!!!Firstly, let's look at the cast, Lee Remick and Gregory Peck are the leads, these two names are nothing short of Hollywood elite. Lee Remick is perfect as the mother who as the movie progresses realises there is something very wrong with her child. (I'm not sure what tipped her off ? was it the baboons attacking her car or her son's feral reaction at the thought of entering a church?) Gregory Peck again is perfectly cast, as no one does noble and principled like Mr Peck. However, it is not only the leads that are terrific, the supporting cast includes David Warner and Tommy Duggan who both put in notable performances but it is Billie Whitelaw that eclipses them all as Damien's overly polite yet sinister nanny. The score of a horror movie is very important, it has to chill to the bone and help create and maintain a feeling of an ever present danger. Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack is probably one of the best scores ever written for a horror movie. It is perfect for The Omen, gloomy, disturbing, chilling music, interlaced with what sounds like religious choirs portending the end of the world. It really is that good and if you don't believe me, consider the fact that it won Jerry Goldsmith an Oscar the following year.By this stage, I know that most of you who were considering going to see the new Omen film at the cinema are now thinking to yourselves 'maybe I will rent the old one instead!' but for the few that are still on the fence here are a few other points to convince you. The 1976 version had a great plot, a child adopted into the corridors of power, whose destiny is to destroy the world, this is a simple and perhaps unoriginal premise however David Seltzer quotes Revelations at every turn and comes up with very original ideas to kill people off. Today, we are used to seeing a lot of blood and gore when people get killed in this genre but this is one thing that the omen lacks. Gore is pre-empted by well choreographed violent outbursts, each one being more frightening and compelling than the last, from a priest being impaled by a church spire to a reporter being decapitated by a pane of glass. These events all build to the foreboding finale. In the last scene we see a little boy, holding the hand of the President of the United States, turning around and smiling at his father's funeral. What greater ending could there be!?!The Omen stands out in this genre and has stood up to the test of time. To-day horror movies are packed with the latest teenage idols and gratuitous violence has replaced good plots and imaginative thinking. (There are exceptions to this of course, Dog Soldiers, The Ring etc.) The Omen combines, a great cast, a great score, and brilliant storytelling without a teenage idol in sight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great supernatural thriller, undeservedly bashed over the years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Omen" was included in a recent book I read of THE 1000 MOVIES YOU MUST SEE BEFORE YOU DIE! - ironic since fellow IMDb user Theo Robertson claims it was included as an entry in a similar book titled THE 50 WORST FILMS OF ALL TIME.I've always really liked "The Omen" and, like Theo, think it is superior to "The Exorcist." It's more chilling and freaky and subtle. There isn't any fake pea soup here, either. Which isn't to say that "The Exorcist" isn't any good - but it hasn't fared as well over the years."The Omen" is just really good. It was released the same year as Exorcist if I'm not mistaken and Gregory Peck gives a fine performance. The part where a character's head is lopped off and rolls across a street in slow-motion, and then director Richard Donner cuts to a whole new sequence, is really chilling and bizarre.It's that sort of eerie unexplained stuff that makes this, in my opinion, superior to a lot of the other stuff out there - i.e. many other trashy supernatural flicks that don't hold anything against this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Devil Made Him Do It!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the heels of the success of The Exorcist, The Omen tells the story of the son of Satan being born from a mysterious pregnancy and given to a U.S. ambassador and his wife in Italy. The couple raise the young child, but things begin to happen to the couple as the boy matures. A governess hangs herself. The child acts wildly when brought near a Church. A spooky governess appears from nowhere to take care of the child. A black evil dog takes up residence at the child's bedroom. To complicate matters, a priest gets in touch with the father and tells him to beware his son and that he is the spawn of evil. The Omen works very well due to several factors. The script is generally well-written. The story is very implausable in some places, but it works on the whole. The use of powerhouse stars like Gregory Peck and Lee Remick in the leads help to give the film the royal treatment, making sure no one mistakes the budget, level of ability, and time put into this production. Peck is very good in his role as a man convinced(finally) of horrifying news. The rest of the cast does equally well with some fine performances by Billie Whitelaw as the crazed, manical governess, Patrick Troughton as the conscience-torn priest, David Warner as a helpful photographer, and Harvey Stephens as the young, sweet-yet evil looking Damien. Most of the film's success can be attributed to director Richard Donner. Donner keeps the pacing of the film tight, uses some first-rate pan shots, and creates a mood and suspense that build climatically throughout the film. Some of the scenes that are most memorable include Damien on a tricycle, Peck and Warner in a cemetery, and most famous of all is the priest's demise. A wonderfully shot sequence. The music in the film is a great asset to the overall mood. A very good film....not nearly as gory or shocking as The Exorcist but still as powerful in its own right for its seemingly somewhat realistic adaptation of scripture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Better Than THE EXORCIST</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie appears in the book 50 Worst Movies Of All Time alongside such fare as ROBOT MONSTER . This is completely undeserved because i rate THE OMEN as one of the best horror movies from the 1970s , if not all time . The book in question makes a big deal of how young Damien's parents experience some ghastly going ons without realising something is seriously wrong , but this is churlish since the audience ( like in most horror movies ) are one step in front of the protagonists , we instantly know what's going on even if the characters on screen don't and this is what makes the narrative so suspenseful , we're waiting for Ambassador Robert Thorn to put two and two together . It should also be pointed out that these types of tradgedies do happen in life and there's a rational explanation with no supernatural causes involvedComparisons with both THE OMEN and THE EXORCIST will be made but this is by much the better film I think . Both films deal with satanic powers and both are very dead pan but unlike THE EXORCIST the serious tone of this movie doesn't go against it , THE EXORCIST goes out of its way to shock the audience while THE OMEN keeps its discipline and is all the better for it . Richard Donner brings shock moments where it's needed like the revelation of the priest after the fire , the scene in the cemetery and the lorry accident at Megiddo and unlike the shock scenes in THE EXORCIST they're never unintentionally funny . Giving roles to well known Brit character actors like Patrick Troughton , Billie Whitelaw , Leo McKern and David Warner also helps the movie a lot The only real criticism I have is that it's not as good as I originally remembered after seeing it for the first time , but that's a problem with a great number of movies I've seen , or that the biblical city of Megiddo is nowhere near the location described in the screenplay ( It is in fact a few short miles west of the border of the West Bank on the route to Jenin ) but that won't matter to 99.9% of the rest of the audience . If I ever write a book called 50 Best Horror Movies Of All Time THE OMEN will definitely feature in it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrifying and genuinely frightening movie that really impacted during the seventies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well made horror movie where numerous people meet horrible deaths by terrible demonic forces . This terror movie fundamentally centers on the rebirth of the anti-Christ, it's a creepy story where occur gruesome and bizarre deaths concerning Satan's son . American diplomat's family ( Gregory Peck and Lee Remick) adopts a baby , he's named Damien and has the devil mark : 666 . One time grown-up , young boy possessed with mysterious demonic powers causing wreak havoc and bizarre killings wherever he goes . The parents hire a nanny (Billie Whitelaw) and she schemes that delightful child anti-Christ can carry out all the evil plans . The little boy seems to be around when inexplicable deaths happen including rid of several interfering adults with the aim for world domination . Damien is poised for ruling devil over earth . Meanwhile the father is warned by a priest named Brennan (Patrick Thoughton) and a photographer( David Warner) and going on inexplicable deaths , as numerous of the roles come to a sticky final . At the ending the film puts a Biblic phrase : ¨Here is wisdom, let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast : for it is the number of a man , and is number is 666¨. Book of Revelation Chapter 13 verse 18 .After the ¨Exorcist¨ , ¨Richard Donner's Omen¨ was one of the most famous films of all time and the major possession movie of the 70s and created an authentic sensation , originating various sequels: ¨Damien, Omen 2 ¨ with William Holden and Lee Grant ,in which Damien is again adopted by a basic couple and proceeds to wreak havoc wherever he goes ; ¨The final conflict¨ with Sam Neill and ¨Omen 4, the awakening ¨ with Faye Grant and Michael Woods ; furthermore a modern remake . The chief excitement lies in seeing what new and amazing victim can be dreamt by the believable effects . Meantime Damien seems to dispatch new bizarre killing every few minutes of the movie . Charismatic performance of excellent protagonists , Peck and Remick , and all around with special mention to Patrick Thougthon as unfortunate priest and Billie Whitelaw as nasty servant . Impressive score by Jerry Goldsmith , deservedly winner one Oscar and colorful cinematography by Gilbert Taylor . The motion picture is originally written by David Seltzer an compellingly directed by Richard Donner .Followed in 2006 by a remake by John Moore starred by Liev Schreiver and Julia Styles , the inevitable comparison between Schreiber and Gregory Peck reveals that Liev is just too cool for this role and though redundant to original film is a fitting description of the director John Moore ,however is sometimes a shot-for-shot recreation but it doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence. ¨ The Omen¨, the story about a little boy possessed with mysterious demonic powers who murders those persons who anger him was a phenomenon and remains one of the highest horror pictures of all time. The movie's intelligence , believable Fx , breathtaking score, luxurious photography all combined to make it a classic and its influence cannot be overstated . Along with ¨The exorcist¨spawned a wave of demonic possession movies that goes on unabated nowadays .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen is one of the best horror films to have come out in the 70's. It isn't gory, it doesn't have sex, it is just plain terrifying. Everything about the movie contributes to feel of the movie. Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar winning score, the great acting, the cinematography and the scary as hell ending.It's the 6th hour on the 6th day of the 6th month. Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) has just found out his newborn son is dead. He can't let his wife Katherine (Lee Remick) know though, since it would devastate her. But when a priest offers him another newborn whose mother died, all problems are solved, they name him Damien.....The Omen is one of my favourite horror films. When I first saw it, it scared the living hell out of me. The score, done by Jerry Goldsmith is now one of the most famous horror movie scores. It sets the mood and sends a chill up your spine. The acting is outstanding (especially Billie Whitelaw as Mrs. Baylock). Gregory Peck and Lee Remick are, as usual, fantastic. Billie Whitelaw is pretty much flawless as the evil nanny and Harvey Stephens, although he doesn't say much, is very good as little Damien.The last thing that makes the movie scary are some of the most bizarre deaths. The most known of them is a decapitation which is one of the scariest deaths in horror history.5/5.</fullReview>

This is the first of 4 films (well 3 because 4 was a terrible TV movie) there was originally going to be 7 movies but it was cut down to 3, I have the pentology which includes the first 3 the terrible TV movie i.e Omen 4 and the 2006 remake and the first like most often is the best.

		<fullReview>Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) is the American ambassador to England. His wife Katharine (Lee Remick) gives birth to a baby who is born dead. Without letting her know Thorn switches her baby with another whose mother died while giving birth. Things are fine until Damien (Harvey Stephens) turns five. Then people start dying and Peck realizes that little Damien may be the Antichrist.HUGE hit in 1976. I saw it when I was 14 at a theatre. I remember liking it but being disappointed. It had an R rating so I expected a much bloodier picture than what I saw. Seeing it again my feelings have changed a little. It still is a very good film and it really doesn't need blood and gore to tell it's story...but I now find it slow and uninvolving. Everyone knows the ending by now and for a film that runs almost two hours that's not good. Still it is worth seeing.The direction by Richard Donner is great (he really knows how to use a widescreen); Remick and Peck are excellent (although I do wonder how they got them to agree to do a horror film); the deserved Oscar-winning score by Jerry Goldsmith helps the film immensely; the script is good and Billie Whitlaw is downright terrifying as Mrs. Baylock--the scene where she goes after Remick in the hospital has always scared me silly.The deaths are inventive (to put it mildly) but very bloodless. Even when Jennings (David Warner) gets his head cut off there's next to no blood. Also that's the best part of the picture--the effect is convincing, the music is pounding and Peck's reaction is realistic.So this is a little slow but the writing, acting, direction and music more than make up for that. I give it an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand why "The Omen", one of the greatest films of the genre, has such a low rate. This is a true masterpiece for many reasons: unforgettable and terrific moments as the scene in the cemetery, a wonderful score by Jerry Goldsmith, very good performances of all the cast... But it wouldn't be so great without it's perfect ending: that boy is certainly more than you can imagine... and he already knows this when he smiles to the camera. Slowly we enter into the nightmare, step by step, death by death, and at last we have no doubt of what's going on; so does Gregory Peck, but his enemy seems to be stronger than anyone all the times, and maybe that's the most frightening thing about "The Omen". Easily the best film of Richard Donner and surely one of the scariest movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The devil went down to London</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film that polarises opinion irrespective of its religious incantations, some unimpressed by its comic-book style hokum, others like myself willing to be immersed in the tale of the anti-Christ (Stephens) born into a wealthy American family living abroad, setting a course for Satan's second coming. Peck, playing American Ambassador to the UK and his wife Lee Remick lose their child during birth, but with the assistance of corrupt clergyman Martin Benson, Peck manages to procure a replacement child of shady origins. In the history of bad decisions, this is right up there with the most catastrophic, as the baby Damien wields his unassuming temperament against those conspiring to subdue the rise of the devil on earth.David Warner co-stars as the intrepid photo journalist who's bitten off more than he can chew investigating a series of strange events surrounding the family, former "Doctor Who" incarnation Patrick Troughton has a memorable supporting role as a doom-saying priest, and other notable roles are played with aplomb by Martin Benson, Leo McKern, Bruce Boa, John Stride and Anthony Nicholls to name a few. Jack's daughter, Holly Palance has a great cameo in one of the film's many penultimate moments, early on at the birthday party.Billie Whitelaw's inspired performance as the sinister house-keeper is perhaps the template that would be emulated many times over (e.g. Dimitra Arliss in "Bless the Child" for example), and in my opinion, the real sleeper in this film. Her measured performance is one of the key aspects that elevates this tale beyond the comic-book hokum for which some reviewers hold contempt, notwithstanding the fuzzy logic on the religious overtures, which to be honest, who really cares. It's only a movie, and a chilling one at that, director Richard Donner immortalising himself with this effort, which in my opinion is easily in the top ten horror films ever made for its imagery, atmosphere, visual effects and of course, "Ave Satani" soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gregory Peck looks suitably concerned as it turns out that the baby he hastily adopted on the night of his own baby's death may be the son of the devil. Turns out the book of revelations details the second coming of the Antichrist or something, so it's an all out adventure for Peck and sidekick David Warner as they try to get to the bottom of the conspiracy. Good old Christian doctrine comes into play here as we've got the doubting (at first) Peck, who writes off Damien's behaviour as that of a normal five-year-old. As the proud father of my own little Damien, I have spent many an hour checking my kid's scalp for three sixes, especially after he's tried to put our budgie in a blender or destroyed a piece of furniture, but at least I haven't had a priest turning up at my door pleading for me to kill my own child. Also, I'm sure that when our babysitter killed herself it was just due to the brimstone tinged contents of our kid's nappy, rather than being compelled to swing from a rope by a persuasive dog. The first Omen film is rather good. It's filled with dread and there's some pretty good set pieces in there, plus when you've got decent actors like Peck and Warner playing it pretty straight that helps things too. It's still worth a watch after all these years, but sad to say any of the sequels don't really stand up to the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this was a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i thought this was one of the best movies i have seen. it was one out of about two movies that actually scared me. Gregory pecks acting was great and damn always had a creepy little grin on his face that you could tell was evil. the last scene was one of the best i would say this is a must see for any horror film enthusiast. This is not your average horror film, it has to do with real life things and was a movie that wouldn't just scare you right away it would get into your head. if i had to say this would be in my top three movies I've ever seen. i have not yet seen the new movie but i doubt that it will be even comparable to what this movie accomplished.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite simply, a frightening horror classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen is one of those films that gets better and better with each viewing. As its coming up for Halloween, i watched my DVD widescreen copy last night.First up, the opening titles in white lettering on a black background is simple and straight forward, with a slowly revealing shadow of a young child standing over the reflective shadow of a cross to symbolise something evil is coming, plus Jerry Goldsmith's fantastic score simply grabs you by the throat and is responsible for 50% of The Omen's success.When watching the scene where Robert Thorn first sees Damien being held by the Nun through the Hospital glass partition, i noticed that the director Richard Donner takes full advantage of 'framing' a picture superbly with the Priest watching Thorn in the background reflected in the glass saying 'It would be a blessing to her...and to the child.' I saw this a lot in The Omen. Praise must go to Gilbert Taylor for excellent photography, a man who would later camera Star Wars: A New Hope.The Omen is full of great scares and creepy atmospheres without relying on buckets of blood and gore to freak us all out. The key here is all in the mind. How could an innocent child be touted as the son of the devil? All the cast: Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, David Warner, Billie Whitelaw, Patrick Troughton and Leo McKern play their roles as serious and straight as possible without even a hint of camp or tongue in cheek and it works brilliantly.Every horror film has its 'shocker' moment to send the audience into a frenzy: Alien has its 'chest burster' moment, Scanners has its 'exploding head' moment etc. etc. But The Omen has the most memorable and shocking death scene that intensifies Gregory Peck's mission to destroy Damien. If you have not seen this film, then i won't say...but you will be shocked...or you'll laugh! The emotions portrayed by Peck towards the end of the film are of a man who knows what needs to be done, but still cannot bring himself to comprehend the situation he has found himself in and all the horrible deaths that have happened. It is one of his most memorable and successful film roles. Lee Remick is excellent as Kathy, her performance is very vulnerable which only enhances her character's role as a tragic victim.Special mention must go to Patrick Troughton as Father Brennan, a truly remarkable performance as the despairing priest who seems as if hes on the brink of madness, his quiet scene by the canal with Gregory Peck is one of the film's highlights. David Warner is really good as well as is Billie Whitelaw who is really chilling as Mrs Baylock, even when shes all smiles in her introduction to the Thorn family you sense something really cold about her.Hollywood should hang its head in shame for daring to produce a remake, (which i haven't and do not want to see) a remake that a whole generation will see and think its amazing because they never bothered to view the classic original...it baffles me why they thought they could make one better for a film that was very successful first time around.See the original Omen...it is a Horror Classic and a lot more thrilling and entertaining than The Exorcist. Ten out of Ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The date is June 6th. The city is Rome. Ambassador Robert Thorn's wife Katherine has just given birth to a stillborn son. Rather than devastate her with the news, Robert agrees to take in another baby born on the same night, in the same hospital, and whose mother died giving him birth. No one but Robert and the hospital priest will ever know that the baby isn't theirs. Six years later, terrible events begin to occur and all of them seem to be centered around the Thorn's son, Damien. A nanny hangs herself at a birthday party, a grim priest tells Robert that he knows who the boy's mother really is, and a news reporter named Jennings is finding alarming omens in the photographs he takes, omens which foretell a violent death for anyone who gets too close to the truth. When Katherine suffers a suspicious miscarriage, Thorn and Jennings head for Rome to find out if it's true: is Damien the Anti-Christ, son of Satan? And if he is, will Robert be able to destroy him?This movie followed in the wake of The Exorcist, and was immensely popular. Movies about apocalyptic disasters and demonic children were hot box office commodities in the 70s, and The Omen had both topics covered. However, The Omen was also an intelligently scripted, beautifully filmed and very suspenseful thriller to boot. It wasn't just a rip off of The Exorcist; it had its own story to tell, one taken from the Book Of Revelation, the most grim and frightening book in the Bible.The characters played by Gregory Peck and Lee Remick may be the "beautiful people" - rich, powerful and privileged - but they are still real people, and quite accessible. Kathy is a strong but emotionally fragile woman who seeks help from a psychiatrist. Robert will do anything to protect her from heartbreak and pain. It is their devotion to each other that makes this film so tense as we watch their lives unravel. Robert thought that by taking Damien in, he would simultaneously save his wife from grief and give an orphan a home, but the road to Hell is paved with good intentions, and in this case, that road is very real. David Warner as Jennings and Patrick Troughton as the cursed Father Brennan also win our sympathy as the ill-fated men who try their best to help Robert. Billie Whitelaw as Mrs. Blaylock is evil personified. We like her even though she's Satan's minion - it's her wicked, secretive smile and the fact that she'll do anything to protect Damien. Even Damien himself has our sympathy, even though little kids in tiny little suits are just really upsettingly scary. It's not Damien's fault that he is what he is - he didn't ask for this dubious honor, after all - and when he begs Robert not to kill him at film's end, it's hard not to feel sorry for both of them. This is a great film, filled with vicious Rottweilers, nasty deaths, powerful music and great performances by the entire cast. Should not be missed by film buffs in general and horror fans in particular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie I just could not believe how well it had been put together by director Richard Donnor. Harvey Stephens was the perfect choice to play Damien "cute but evil". The Scene where he looks at the dog and waves is just a classic! and then there is the score...Jerry Goldsmith won a well deserved Oscar for this movie in which he created two excellent themes "Ave Satani" and "Piper Dreams" which carry this movie along with brilliance.People seem to always compare this movie to "The Exorcist"....why???, The Exorcist is a classic all on it's own. The Omen deals with a completely different subject to The Exorcist, while The Exorcist deals with possession, The Omen deals with the child of the devil 'the antichrist'.The Omen has one thing The Exorcist does not have "a classic score". The Exorcist used Tubular Bells with great effect which actually was never written for the movie. The Score written for The Exorcist is still vertically unknown to this day.The movie opens with the silhouette of a young boy, the shadow of which gradually turns into a cross. It's simple, yet very chilling, and sets the tone. We then meet Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck). It's Rome, and it's 6am, on the 6th day on the 6th month. His wife Kathy (Lee Remick) has just given birth to a child, which died almost immediately. At the hospital a priest named Spiletto convinces him to secretly adopt a child, whose mother died during childbirth. Thorn agrees and keeps it a secret from his wife. They name the child Damien. Thorn is then promoted, from American Ambassador to Italy to Ambassador to Great Britain. We see the happy family in London, the perfect life. It however all starts to go wrong at Damien's fifth birthday party and to make matters worse Damien's adopted father Robert Thorn eventually learns that he is actually the devil's son (The Antichrist).This movie is a horror classic and will remain a classic for many year to come.***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the films ever made, this is easily one of the most notorious. If for no other reason than all the freak accidents that occurred during the film's production; cast and crew members fell in danger, and a few passed away, from plane crashes and car accidents throughout the production period. It makes one wonder whether there was a curse of some kind surrounding the film.Regardless, it was a success in its day, and continues to resonate. It is most memorable for the freaky deaths it shows on screen (something of a progenitor to the Final Destination films; there are a few scenes in The Omen where some small or freakish thing causes another thing to maim, impale, or decapitate the hapless characters). In between these scenes, the film takes on a slow pace, and uses all its breathing room to let the story and narrative flow.Despite its pace, the film manages to maintain interest (and maintain tension) through its story. It does a phenomenal job at taking the core theological concept and weaving a tale out of it: a tale that feels plausible and realistic. In spite of that, it really instills the fear in the viewer; the on-screen deaths and the off-screen implications help build the tension and dread in the audience on a psychological level, and that makes it very effective as a horror story. It helps that the story and characters are thoughtfully developed.This film looks really classy, with decent photography and editing. Acting is great; Gregory Peck is impeccable, and everybody fulfills their roles well. Writing is strong. This production has adequate and real-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales. Music is epic! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Perfect | Film: Very Good)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Seventies brought both devil worship and Bible prophecy as subjects for the cinema and the two best known examples of the genre were The Omen and The Exorcist.Gregory Peck is a rich American industrialist whose wife, Lee Remick, has just lost her child at birth. In a moment of vulnerability he makes a deal with some rather strange people who provide him with a newborn as a substitute. Lee and Greg leave the hospital in Rome with Lee none the wiser. Shortly after that Peck is appointed the American Amabassador to the United Kingdom.When people start meeting all kinds of strange and bizarre ends around young Harvey Stephens as Damien, a few bells do start going off. But the film ends with most of the cast dispatched by satanic forces looking to protect the devil's own.Peck and Remick do fine in the leads, they both realize that the roles and the film will indeed be subjects for satire later on, but perform without any tongue in cheek at all. My favorite in the supporting cast is Patrick Troughton, best known as the second of the Doctor Whos, and he plays a corrupt Roman Catholic priest. In bizarre endings he meets one of the most bizarre. Ditto to Holly Palance, Jack's daughter who plays young Damien's first governess.These films aren't exactly my cup of tea. But The Omen made a mint back in the day and who can argue with that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Weird Little Boy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror took an extreme left turn after ROSEMARY'S BABY. Where in that film, the 'horror' in itself was never seen except through dreamy suggestions, another film came and took center stage to claim its own niche in the list of "scariest movies of all time." THE EXORCIST was at its core a battle between good and evil to ensure the innocence of a little girl possessed by the insane spirit of a demon.That film broke all the barriers as to how horror could be filmed, what could be seen and what envelopes could be pushed. With groundbreaking use of music, sound effects, subliminal images and a genuine sense of extreme dread, director William Friedkin created a powerful, unforgettable film that until this day sends chills down anyone's spine.So it was natural with the advent of THE EXORCIST that films would capitalize on its success and horror would be expressed in even more graphic ways. Since it dealt with the conflict of Good vs. Evil at a religious level, why not bring that into the cryptic End of Days theme where Evil as an Entity would rise one last time and defy the Lord? Brilliant idea.Hence the plot of THE OMEN, which combined elements from these previous two films in the form of a conspiracy, not of Satanists but of evil priests longing to bring forth their own Antichrist, and what a better way than to give him a privileged birth where he could rise against mankind himself? This little boy would carry the symbolic name Damien -- daemon, demon -- and would wreck havoc against those perceived as threats.So into the Thorn household Damien comes and immediately, gruesome incidents begin happening. Not surprisingly, no one catches on until it is too late and the damage has been done -- a ploy made to ensure sequels, more than likely. How evil can be so powerful is beyond me, but apparently, it does know no boundaries. At least it showcases a slew of spectacular deaths, and poor Lee Remick has the unfortunate position of falling not once, but twice. (I think three would have been excessive.) This is the sort of film that is made for one purpose only: money. Laughable dialogue, moments that instead of scaring are irritating or plain flat, a conclusion anyone can see miles away, THE OMEN would indeed spawn two sequels and a made for TV movie, each worse than the previous. Sad to see actors the stature of Gregory Peck and Billie Whitelaw wasted in roles that are meaningless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Horror Movies Lack Today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a perfect example of how far the horror movie genre has fallen. In a world of instant gratification and an ever-shrinking attention span, filmmakers have to resort to intense gore and cheap jump scares to scare an audience, with a few notable exceptions (Conjuring, Oculus, etc). This movie is an example of how fresh and innovative a horror movie could be, as well as how moving it could be.(I find it highly unlikely that anyone doesn't know the big surprise in this film, but just in case, "spoilers" ahead)What's so intensely scary about this movie is what so many modern horror filmmakers have lost sight of. It isn't so much WHAT IS that's scary as the prospect of WHAT COULD BE. The idea that this child you've reared, loved, and embraced for five years is actually the devil incarnate - the idea is simply terrifying. The idea of having to slay your own child - horrific. The thought that your house has been overrun by demonic forces, and it is up to you alone to try and remove them - wonderfully scary.Now, don't get me wrong - ideas are not the only scary thing in this film. This film offers plenty of good scares, but the typical jump scare is rare here. The building tensions, the chill-inducing chorus and their never-ending mantra - what happens in the film is scarier than any jump scare the movie does have.Also, the use of gore - there is blood, and when it happens, it's substantial. But the use of gore sparingly is light years more effecting than pervasive balls-out, in-your-face gore. It's used sparingly so that when it does happen, it's more jarring.All this to say, see this film. Don't fall for the cheap cinematic thrills put before you today. See this film, and see what horror used to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More tragic than scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when The Omen premiered back in 1976. It made a pretty big splash due to intrigue with the Horror genre involving the diabolic. Television trailers featured the action parts such as the Safari drive with hissing baboons. The movie mavens did a good job marketing this as a horror vehicle and there is no doubt this movie made a big profit.The Omen opens on a very strange and tragic tone. The rest of the film is pretty grim throughout, and up until the climax. There aren't any scenes or nuances of comic relief. It is just a somber exercise in fear and dread deeply seating itself in the morass of Biblical prophecy and symbolism.Our protagonist, Robert Thorn, a wealthy American magnate of some vague political stature, drives frantically through the streets of Rome as we hear the Voice-over of the priest, Fr.Spiletto, sadly informing him of his stillborn child. Expressing to the priest his wife's desire to have her own child, he agrees to adopt a child born at the same time whose mother died while giving birth to him. The exchange is made and Mr. Thorn's somber expression cannot be hidden. He basically deceives his wife who unknowingly has a strange child. This child as we all know is the Son of Satan. Images of happy family outings and picture collages flash on the screen, but we cannot share their joy knowing that this kid is destined for bad news. The heart of the story doesn't develop until the Devil Boy, Damien, reaches the age of five. Then everything starts to change from his temperament, his personality, their luck and the new staff of assistants. And it's not for the better. We all know what's going down as this story unravels. Disturbing scenes of people who are privy to the impending Evil get killed off. So we want to see what happens. But Good doesn't prevail in this movie like it did in The Exorcist or The Shining. This is a grim and depressing film. It is effective in making us queasy and upsetting us, but it is certainly not without its flaws.I like the atmospheric quality of the movie and there are some stunning camera angles. Effective usage of dim lighting and Old-mansion sets are used very well. The background score is my least favorite aspect of the film. The chanting and symphonic music feels too corny and grandiose. Not very good choice for unnerving music, although it won an Academy Award for best Musical Score. My biggest peeve about The Omen is a peeve I have with most Horror movies; the characters are too thickheaded and dense to understand what's going on. Gregory Peck, a great guy and actor, looks so out of place with his stagy presence and stentorian voice. Being the most clueless of all the characters in the movie, one wonders why a man of his station can be so stupid. And he is. It takes him too long to realize his son is not just weird, but a malevolent being. Lee Remick is pretty wooden as an actress until she gets afraid and dawns that frozen petrified look of terror with her Icy gaze and panic stricken countenance. The boy is too young to really show any acting chops so the director cops out by having him flash creepy grins over his pale skin and eyebrow-less face. The crazy priest seems too over the top initially, but when we learn he is a troubled soul with mental issues, the actor is justified in his approach. "My character is crazy so I can act as crazy as I want" theory.The Omen keeps us in suspense while there are a few scenes that lag, they are used appropriately to further the plot.So many questions bother me about this film and films like it. Why does the Devil want to kill off family members? Does the little boy know he is Evil? Is the Devil an actual being that can take on many forms, or is The Devil the evil in mankind? What is the significance of the Jackal? And why a Jackal and not a pig, a moose or a leopard? Do we take it literally that a human fetus can gestate in the body of another species? Is this a supernatural element similar to The Virgin Birth of Christ? Why did Kathy's last pregnancy trouble her to want an abortion? Why did the crazy priest implore Mr. Thorn to have the baby killed? It was the 5 year old Damien who was the bad seed, not the unborn fetus.These are the questions that go unanswered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic in every sense of the word</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the birth of his son, a US diplomat in London gradually begins to suspect something is wrong with him and when the demonic truth is thrust upon him he resolves to put an end to it to save the world.This here is an unmitigated classic that still holds up well to this day. A lot of this is due to the fact that the film manages to mix the classy approach with far more appropriate horror dealings, and that leaves this one very nicely in combining those two within this. The general air to this one, from its grandiose atmosphere to the star-power and it's respectability all manage to scream out about its origins and big-budget background, and they do tend to help this out in terms of building the horror. The travel to the church and the rather chilling encounter in the cemetery does manage to incorporate a rather suspenseful air to this while still employing a far classier edge that doesn't betray those horror angles since this one is firmly in the belief that this is still a horror film. That keeps this one building a rather tense tone throughout this by continuing to keep it's scenes rooted quite firmly in the genre so scenes like the cemetery attack, reputable not only for truly revealing the story but also the savage action of the dog attacks jumping all over them while savagely barking and yelling the whole time in a truly masterful scene and echoes the baboon attack earlier which is just as much fun. There's a lot of these types of scenes throughout the film, from the chase in the park to the church ambush following that as well as the birthday party scene which is all sorts of chilling here in front of the kids present as well as the finale where he has to come face-to-face with all the evil forces finally at full-force against him which is all sorts of fun while mixing in some chilling elements to this. That's where this one really gets a lot of positive points and might actually be the best part of this one where all the actions within this one feel creepier than they really should due to the fact that it's a horror effort, from the gradual dawning of his status to the camera play showcasing their future fates as well as the ruse about the adoption all creating a sinister air here. While this one does take a little too long to get going and spell itself out, it's not enough of a detriment with the positives here.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Language, children in danger and mild, off- screen animal violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best films of 70s, as well as one of the best horror films ever made.A landmark of satanic cinema.A truly frightening chiller. A definite classic of the horror genre.In 1976 The Omen was a hit among critics and audiences hungry for more after The Exorcist with its mixture of Gothic horror and mystery and its plot about a young boy suspected of being the personification of the Antichrist. Directed by Richard Donner best known later for his Superman and Lethal Weapon films, The Omen gained a lot of credibility from the casting of Gregory Peck and Lee Remick as a distinguished American couple living in England, whose young son Damien bears "the mark of the beast". At a time when graphic gore had yet to dominate the horror genre, this film used its violence discreetly and to great effect, and the mood of dread and potential death is masterfully maintained. it's highly entertaining. Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar-winning score works wonders to enhance the movie's creepy atmosphere.It was the performance of Harvey Stephens as the young Damien that invested the film with the chill of genuine credibility. Richard Donner's direction is taut. Every actor are all are strong. Goldsmith's score took the film to a level horror films generally never attained in the 1970s. Viewed thirty years on, Richard Donner's demonic classic remains one of the finest horror movies to have been put out by a mainstream studio.The movie boasted a particularly disturbing scene, in which a character willingly and joyfully hangs herself at a birthday party attended by young children. It also features a violent decapitation scene (caused by a horizontal sheet of plate glass), one of mainstream Hollywood's first: "If there were a special Madame Defarge Humanitarian Award for best decapitation," wrote Kim Newman in Nightmare Movies (1988), "this lingering, slow-motion sequence would get my vote." fares a whole lot better than its 2006 remake.Influenced by the success of The Exorcist, this film takes the horror genre one step further and instead of a girl being possessed by the Devil, we have a boy who's the Antichrist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Let Him Kill Me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood has this annoying tendency to remake films that don't need to be remade! Alfred Hitchcock's genre-defining 'Psycho' (1960) got a shot-by-shot remake, so did 'The Producers' (1968), and so did this film. What next, a remake of 'Jaws' (1975), 'The Sting' (1973) or even 'Citizen Kane' (1941) or 'Casablanca' (1942)?!If nothing else, the remake proved that you cannot improve on the casting of the original. Gregory Peck and Lee Remick are such a convincing screen couple that you could even believe that they were not acting!! Their respective ages at the time of filming are even consistent with those of a couple desperate to have their own child before it is too late, which lends credence to the plot, unlike the remake. David Warner actually developed the character of Jennings from a one-dimensional character into someone with a bit more seediness and sudden tragedy, so to praise David Thewlis in the remake is to praise him for usurping another's performance! And Billie Whitelaw, though literally the nanny from Hell, is such a fun and malicious character that you don't mind the nagging feeling that people as wealthy and renowned as the Thorns would never allow her near their child! Even Jack Palance's daughter, Holly, gets a very memorable role as the Thorns' original nanny, whilst Leo McKern gives a fanatical performance as archaeologist and exorcist, Carl Bugenhagen, which he would continue into 'Damien: Omen II' (1978).The plot itself focuses on the lie that Peck's character, Robert Thorn tells his wife, Kathy (Remick) to conceal the fact that their child was apparently stillborn and that, in desperation, he secretly adopted a child to replace it so as to spare her the overwhelming grief. It's a classic horror/thriller set-up that you continue to see in original films today.Director, Richard Donner insisted on stripping the script of all glaring Satanic references so as to focus on the inner plight of both Thorn and his wife as they come to suspect that their 'son', Damien (Harvey Stephens - in a role that redefined creepy/evil children in films and culture, generally) is, shall we say, not quite right. After all, wasn't it the blissfully ignorant Del Boy who took Rodney's advice in naming his own son Damien? Damien lives a happy five years with his adoptive parents before all hell breaks loose and both Robert and Kathy are driven to breaking point.The point of this film (unlike the sequels) is that it is all about interpretation. Is Robert Thorn's lie getting to him? Or is little Damien really a devil incarnate? Most think the latter, but Donner wanted to leave the audience guessing and, in many ways, 'The Omen' is best seen as a standalone film, even though the sequels are certainly worth a look.A key point of this film is the fantastically eerie and bone-chilling musical score by the legendary Jerry Goldsmith, who earned an Academy Award for his work on this film. And rightly so! It is just a shame that Goldsmith, the musical talent behind such films as 'The Planet of The Apes' (1968), 'Chinatown' (1974) and 'Alien' (1979) didn't win one more often!! Go ahead, check your film collection - Goldsmith quite possibly figures in it!And, even though both the fashions and the special effects seem a bit dated, they are part of the charm of the film. Damien inspired a whole (black) mass of imitators and sequels and remakes, but the original truly shines above all of them. Quite clearly inspired by both 'Rosemary's Baby' (1968) and 'The Exorcist' (1973), 'The Omen' delivered at a time when horror films were all the rage. It was very, very lucky to lure in such stars as it did (particularly in terms of securing such classic American actors as Peck and Remick), as horror was something of a dirty word in cinema at the time and, rather than being another American horror film, the politics- heavy plot is set primarily in the UK, with both Italy and Israel providing a further backdrop to the devilish proceedings.The death scenes are great but, unlike the sequels, the focus is not on them. A lot of odd happenings transpire that drive Robert and Kathy literally out of their minds whereas, in the sequels, every odd occurrence is literally a death of some sort.Plus, an interesting point that has not been lost on reviewers is that the fictional Thorn family throughout this and the sequels seems to reflect the real-life Kennedy family. Robert Thorn, alike Joe Kennedy, is American Ambassador to the Court of St. James and the Thorns continue to suffer a succession of tragedies throughout the 'Omen' series until Damien Thorn himself is compared to JFK in the 'Omen III: The Final Conflict' (1981).Literally the best in the series, this makes fine Halloween viewing or, if you're like me, you may find this to be a rollicking good psychological thriller for any time of the year -- perhaps one that bears the most re-watching!The only reason that I have not given it 10/10 is that the technical specifications of the time are not always great. Picture and sound aren't perfect, but aren't even half as flawed as they are in a film like 'Charade' (1966). Really, it's a small complaint for such an entertaining film and I feel overly picky just writing this! So, there seems little more to say, except "Ave Satani!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining little horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one real reason I wanted to watch this is because I saw the fourth movie due to a debate on message boards and after that movie left a bad taste in my mouth I wanted to watch the original just so I can't associate "The Omen" with bad acting, laugh-out-loud hilarity and absent suspense. I honestly though it was decent.I'm sure people may know of this plot. An ambassador finds out his adopted child is really the offspring of Satan (or the Antichrist - however you want to word it - both have a nice ring to it). People around are dying in freak accidents. A photographer who helps this ambassador helps him because photographs have predicted both the freak accidents and he took a picture of himself that shows him getting decapitated.This movie is pretty good. I don't really care much for the concept though (it's because I'm an atheist - I haven't been a Christian for about 5 years). The directing is very suspenseful, but a complaint about that is that the suspenseful scenes are a little too few, but it was enough to keep me watching until the very end. I might watch the other 2, but if I can watch the fourth one then I'm pretty sure I've watched the worst Omen movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that put 666 on the map</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who would have thought that an occult film based on the story of anti-Christ would be so good ? Damian Thorn who is born from a Jackal was switched at birth with son of an ambassador. He's the anti-Christ, and has the mark of 666 on his head. The story unfolds as his father gradually finds out what his son really is.Not only was the theme sensational, so was the intricacies of the plot, and the story itself. Not to mention the very stylish and gory ways people gets killed. The only movie I can think of that comes close is "Eyes Wide Shut". First class acting by the stars also adds to the quality of the movie. One of the best horror movies to be made. This one is definitely worth the watch.</fullReview>

I'm not sure if it was the movie itself or the wonderful music score that added the final touch to each scene. The choice of stars for this movie was the best at the time. Gregory Peck as the father was a perfect choice. And whoever decided to added Harvey Stephens as Damien should be awarded an Oscar just for that choice. I would not watch this movie alone now even though I'm pushing forty year old. I think if someone was to watch this movie now, they would laugh it off, but then this was an awesome movie. Just think this was back in the 70's when the worst thing on television was the evening news.</fullReview>

He was destined to destroy them to move closer to his ultimate goal of world control.As the sinister governess, Billie Whitelaw is excellent is conveying the emotion of an evil woman.The ending is quite predictable. Nobody allows a child to get stabbed to death under Hollywood standards.While adequate for the part, Peck seems uncomfortable when not acting in films of social consciousness.

		<shortDescription>Better than most of the "Exorcist" rip-offs...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wealthy Ambassador is told the baby his wife was carrying was delivered stillborn, and that yet another infant in the ward was born healthy but the mother died; he agrees to a secretive switch, but lives to regret it. Once "The Exorcist" took off, every studio in Hollywood had to cash in on the devil-cycle with stories of the occult. This one has a large budget (which accounts for its handsome, chilly-gray look) and a good cast, but it continually warns of frightening prophecies and then proceeds to throw outlandish killings at us. Poor Lee Remick suffers two different falls in a disgraceful bit of bad screen writing; Gregory Peck and David Warner fend off a pack of devil dogs at a cemetery in a battle which would've left them dead (here, they stagger away). The film clobbers the viewer with distress, with bodies piling up as if from a slasher movie (this film is really no different, it just has a slicker look). Gripping and occasionally suspenseful, but always in an unpleasant, distasteful way. Followed by an extremely woebegone batch of bad sequels. ** from ****</fullReview>

What really is chilling is that Damian in this movie is a little kid. A little kid! He is being protected by those around him against people exposing his dark secret. Obviously this is not real, but the film sets a tone that little kids may not be as innocent as they seem. Excellent film. Dark and scary. Really atmospheric and haunting. Everything in this film is unpredictable which makes it scary as hell. Is that person going to die? Is that person bad? What's going to happen here???

		<fullReview>You pretty much are guaranteed a home run when Gregory Peck is first up to bat. Then add in the wonderful Lee Remick, the intriguing David Warner, and a dose of Leo McKern, and you've got a ball game! This first film is the Omen trilogy has it all. A superb cast, a good plot that restricts itself to a limited time period, top notch special effects (at least for the time; although the beheading scene is till terrific), and an age old prophecy turned into a modern-day story. My only complaint is that it's too bad there wasn't someone like Peter Jackson around to supervise the two sequels...because that's where this tale of 3 films falls apart...no uniform guiding hand to keep the sequels up to the level of the original.Of course I saw this film at the theater back in 1976, but I hadn't seen it since until 2014. I had forgotten just how good it was. Let me restate that. I had forgotten just how great it was.And I think here is the key that made "chapter 1" so good -- superb acting crafted by Gregory Peck and Lee Remick that made us want to like those lead characters. It was ever hard to resist resist Damien! Compare this to the first sequel where William Holden and Lee Grant seem cold and don't make us want to like them at all. I'd almost have to say that Peck is masterful here...although I wonder how much he liked tackling this kind of project.For those of us who enjoy "quality" horror films, this one fits the bill! Savor it, because the taste of the sequels is a bit bitter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ave Satani!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One amongst the cycle of "demonic child" films which started with Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby &amp; scaled new heights with William Friedkin's The Exorcist, The Omen may not be as great as those two horror classics but it's still one of the most memorable chillers to come out from the 1970s &amp; even today, its sinister atmosphere manages to work remarkably well for the most part when compared to its counterparts.The story of The Omen concerns Robert &amp; Katherine Thorn whose first child turns out to be a stillborn &amp; in order to conceal the tragic news from her, he adopts a newborn whose mother died in childbirth, and raises him as his own. But when the boy turns five, strange inexplicable events starts taking place &amp; after the ominous warnings of a priest, Robert decides to uncover the true identity of his adopted child.Brilliantly directed by Richard Donner &amp; deftly scripted by David Seltzer, the one thing I really like about this film is that it is very much aware of its strength &amp; weaknesses and does a fascinating job in working on the former. Despite being a supernatural horror, it never explicitly depicts what's typical in those category of films which provides it a certain layer of realism &amp; further amplifies the eerie mood it manages to sustain throughout its runtime.Also, it's not afraid to take its time for setting up the events, its characters &amp; its ambiance and still manages to provide a smooth flow to everything. The camera-work is nicely carried out, editing is cleverly done &amp; Jerry Goldsmith's score masterfully infuses a sense of uneasiness into the plot. Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, David Warner &amp; others chip in with excellent performances and the final shot is one creepy image audience won't be forgetting soon.On an overall scale, The Omen may not have set any new standard in horror filmmaking although it does feature one of mainstream cinema's first on-screen decapitations but it still remains a spooky but entertaining cinematic ride that uses its resources pretty well. The unnecessary sequels &amp; one remake it spawned might have dented its legacy a little but if you're looking for a finely crafted chiller that's neither too extreme nor too heavy, then look no further than The Omen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The real horror lies in what we don't see and what we fear about the future.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the abundance of fear-pounding movies about demons, satanic creatures and theories of the world's ending (and Satan's take-over of it), classic movies like this sometimes are looked upon as pre-historic in comparison. The real issue is today that it seems that more than 50 percent of the movies coming out and T.V. series going on (and quickly off) the air are all about the fear that is the future of society as we would not like to know it.When "The Omen" first came out, it was unjustly compared to "The Exorcist" simply because of its sinister supernatural nature and the fact that it involved a child (Harvey Stevens). The two movies couldn't be any more different. In reflection, "The Omen" is a much better movie because its chills are real and the fear comes out of the unknown rather than silly gimmicks like throwing up pea soup. Here, priests are speared, nosy reporters slaughtered, and an innocent nanny is possessed by something which leads her to commit suicide in a ghastly manner. Wild animals in a wildlife park go ballistic just by the presence of an innocent child, and the mother, unaware that the child she has in her arms isn't hers, undergoes a series of horrors that are certainly a fate worse than death. Evil comes in the presence of the new nanny (Billie Whitelaw), one of the scariest looking servants since "Rebecca's" Mrs. Danvers.Damien's "parents" are the prominent Gregory Peck (an American ambassador overseas) and his gorgeous wife Lee Remick. They are happily married with the exception of the fact that she has been unable to have a child-until now. The well-meaning Peck doesn't want to break his wife's heart when their child is stillborn and takes in a child whose mother he has been told has died in childbirth. With piercing blue eyes, this baby boy is gorgeous, and grows into a beautiful child. But his destiny has been foretold and by the time Peck learns the truth, it is way too late and real horrors never heard of in a Grimm fairy tale begin to take over their lives.This is a suspenseful and horrific tale of what the book of Revelations has been warning us about for centuries. This is the beginnings of the life of who became world leader Carpathia in the best-selling "Left Behind" series, only told through a non-Christian perspective. The world has not yet gone through the rapture or any of the tribulations predicted by the book of Revelations. This is simply the story of a family whose structure is destroyed because of the element of evil accidentally dropped into its lap. An invisible evil presence is felt through Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar winning score, one of the spookiest in film history, and definitely appropriate to the sinister mood. It reminded me of the atmospheric middle-ages score by John Barry written for "The Lion in Winter".Of the sequels and remakes, only the second (and minimally, the third) really hold any interest when compared to this. While almost 40 years have gone by without any definitive sign of a possible anti-Christ living in our world, hints are always subtly revealed, leaving spooky parallels in world history. Today's films seem to be overstuffed with the glorification of this coming of evil, making the warnings of the initial "Omen" films easier to take on the souls because their message and motives were clear rather than indications that the writers of the newer films are welcoming this change in history with open hearts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MY REVIEW: The Omen of Horrors!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And I thought Rosemary's Baby (my personal favourite) is the most scary movie on the God's rival Satan's child entry into the world of ours. I was proved wrong when I saw The Omen. The Omen takes the idea of Rosemary's Baby forward and tells you the story of a family who finds that their son can be the son of Satan. The atmosphere is enhanced by haunting back ground score, water tight screenplay, sincere acting, taught direction and a lot of scary moments making this horror experience a masterpiece. There are many scenes that stand out like a group of Baboons attacking the car carrying Satan's son, father and the photographer finding the dead mother of Satan's son, father reciting a verse from bible after finding the news of death of his beloved, the killing of photographer and many more. It might be hard to go and re- watch the movie because of its genuine scare moments but it stands at very top in my list of best horrors because as they say "horror lies in knowing something bad is about to happen". All horror lovers, don't miss it and all people who get scared easily, please stay away from it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid bit of big budget 70's religious-themed horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Rome, an American diplomat's wife has a stillborn baby. He secretly swaps another from a woman who died in birth. Unfortunately for him, this child is the spawn of Satan.This was the third in the big three satanic themed horror movies released by the Hollywood studios; The Omen falls somewhere between the other two, Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist. It doesn't have the subtlety of the former but is a lot more restrained than the latter. It's probably the most obviously mainstream of the three, although in fairness all three were smash hits at the box office. They all share the scary idea of the ultimate evil being channelled through the vessel of a child. This one, alongside Rosemary's Baby, is more specifically about the birth of the Antichrist but where Rosemary's Baby ends with the birth of the child, The Omen begins with this event. In doing so, we focus our attention on the impact of the child as opposed to the mother's pregnancy as we did in Roman Polanski's film. This change basically opens the door for a less restrained film, with the depiction of a variety of violent supernatural events that follows in the wake of the Antichrist on Earth. In this sense, it's a film where inventive macabre set-pieces play an important role. In particular, the death scenes stay firmly in the mind. We have a particularly haunting scene where the boy's first nanny hangs herself in front of the guests at a large garden party, later on there are a couple of elaborate death scenes where a man is impaled by a falling church spire during a storm and another where a photographer is decapitated by a sheet of glass. These latter two sequences typify the kind of inventively violent deaths that would make up the large part of the subsequent sequels. In this first instalment they are integrated into a plot with a greater emphasis on story development. A lot of the focus is on the boy's 'father' and his initial reluctance to believe the truth and his subsequent return to Italy to discover the horrific facts behind Damien's birth. This results in some interesting, sinister moments such as the scene in the ancient Etruscan graveyard where the body of the boy's mother is found. So The Omen is a good mix of the atmospheric and violent horror strands.The high production values in this one are fairly obvious. There's location shooting in Italy, Britain and Israel. A cast led by the A-Lister Gregory Peck and with fine support work from several others including ex Doctor Who actor Patrick Troughton as a troubled priest, David Warner as a photographer whose pictures reveal strange and ominous hidden supernatural imagery and, best of all, Billie Whitelaw as the very sinister nanny Mrs Baylock. Additionally, child actor Harvey Stephens is suitably creepy as young Damien. While it would be seriously remiss to not mention composer Jerry Goldsmith's sterling contribution, seeing as his score is one of the best things about the movie - its sinister choirs all the way in a very dramatic soundtrack. The focused direction from Richard Donner holds everything together resulting in a very solid film indeed. It was followed by a couple of entertaining sequels that carried on the story in a pretty satisfactory fashion.</fullReview>

Strange things start to happen when Damien is around.Rarely has a child look more menacing but they have made Harvey Stephens truly creepy. It's a slow moving film. There isn't many big action or thrilling scenes. There are some iconic visuals like the women jumping off the roof to hang herself, the priest spiked to the ground, or maybe the most iconic of all Damien on a tricycle. These are images that will be remember long after we're all gone. For that I would recommend this movie. It also doesn't hurt to have Gregory Peck.</fullReview>

Others try to warn Mr. Thorn about the danger, until Robert is confronted by irrefutable proof of Damien's origins, but by then it could be too late...Intriguing but overheated thriller certainly is slickly made and watchable, but credibility is low, and story relies far too much on melodrama and shock value, rather than thoughtful horror drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sublime Occult Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Omen" of 1976 is a true classic of occult Horror that is capable of mesmerizing and giving the viewer the creeps even after repeated viewings. Richard Donner's film was doubtlessly inspired by William Friedkin's earlier classic "The Exorcist", and, along with Friedkin's film, one of the absolute must-sees involving satanic kids. This simply is a film that works perfectly on all levels: The most intriguing Horror topic is illustrated with a spine-chilling and fascinating premise, and executed brilliantly on all levels. The film is an incredibly atmospheric, persistently suspenseful and genuinely creepy Horror Thriller and an intelligent Drama at the same time. The fascinating story is brought to screen with greatness in all aspects, be it the ingenious settings and cinematography, the constantly high suspense-level, the great acting or the tense atmosphere which is underlined by a simply unforgettable score.Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) is the American Ambassador in Rome. When his unconscious wife Catherine (Lee Remick) gives birth to a stillborn baby boy, Thorn can't bring himself to tell her. At the suggestion of a priest, he exchanges his dead son with another newborn boy, whose mother has died in childbirth, making his wife believe the healthy boy is hers. Both his real son, who died, and the the other boy whom he accepts as his son were born under a bad Omen: it is the sixth hour of the sixth day of the sixth month; the year is 1966. The couple name the boy Damien... Five years later, the Thorns have moved to London, where Robert has become the U.S. Ambassador to England. With Damien's fifth birthday party, mysterious things begin to happen around the boy..."The Omen" is one of several 'demonic child' films from the 70s, but, in my humble opinion it is definitely one of the best ones. Personally, I would even say it surpasses both previous films that it is most often compared to: Roman Polanski's "Rosemary's Baby" (1968) and Willaim Friedkin's "The Exorcist" (1973). These two films are both classics, no doubt, but while "Rosemary's Baby" has dated a bit, and also has its lengths, and the "Exorcist" has many unforgettably creepy moments but sometimes lacks cohesion, "The Omen" is incredibly suspenseful from the beginning to the end, and its coherent and extremely creepy script is brought to screen in a brilliant manner in all parts of the film, forming a stunningly uncanny and tense wholesome. The film has an intensely creepy atmosphere and a constantly gloomy feeling of doom from the beginning. The story simply is very creepy as such, and director Donner brings it to screen in a manner that is truly magnificent. The photography, choreography and settings, and, maybe most memorably, the brilliant, spine-chilling score - this film's atmosphere is rich in all aspects. At the same time, "The Omen" is also a compelling and highly intelligent film with complex characters. The acting is superb. Gregory Peck's reputation as one of the greatest actors ever in cinema is no coincidence, and he is once again brilliant here. Great performances also come from the other cast members, such as Lee Remick who plays the wife, David Warner, or Patrick Troughton, who plays a great little role and whom fellow Horror fans will also know for his roles in Hammer's films such as "Scars of Dracula". Utmost praise has to be given to then-six-year-old Harvey Stephens, who once again proves that children can be the creepiest of all Horror creatures. His performance is scary and very powerful, one of the truly memorable child-performances in Horror cinema. The film mainly builds up suspense through plot and atmosphere and isn't very action-packed. Yet it includes several highly memorable disturbing and gory moments. The ingenious decapitation sequence is only one of them. "The Omen" is an absolute must-see for all Horror-fans and film- lovers in general. A remake was done in 2006, but I will probably never watch it (recent Horror remakes tend to make me angry). This original is a spine-chilling occult masterpiece that must not be missed... by anyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another 1970s horror masterpiece, undiminished by it's sequels and imitations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1970s was a big year for Satan. For some reason he seemed to be the hot ticket for Hollywood horror. Often times this was successful, others not so much. 'The Exorcist' terrified moviegoers in 1973, so much so that many were said to have gone straight to a church from the movie theatre. It's as if people were afraid that by watching the film, Satan could take their soul. But for Hollywood this was like a gift from God, and in subsequent years other studios and countries tried to cash in. Films like 'Beyond the Door,' 'Devil Dog: House of Hell,' and 'Satan's School For Girls' didn't exactly rake in the dough or high ratings, but not every film that dealt with the subject was a failure. On the 6th day, of the 6th month, of the 6th year of the decade the world was introduced to the person who was second in command after the Devil: his son.Pros: Excellent work by a first rate cast. Awesome score by Jerry Goldsmith. A smart script by David Seltzer. Crisp, stunning cinematography. Moves at a good steady pace. Has a feeling of dread about it. Director Donner and writer Seltzer do a fantastic job of creating suspense and keeping things from getting too predictable. Some fabulous architecture and beautiful scenery. Some really terrifying sequences and images.Cons: One earlier sequence involving an indoor fall is poorly executed and looks cheap when it should have been more visceral and realistic. Not that his performance is bad, far from it, but Gregory Peck is upstaged by some of his co-stars and it should be the other way around since he's the male lead and protagonist.Final thoughts: Though not nearly as frightening or exhausting as 'The Exorcist,' 'The Omen' ranks up there as one of the great horror films of it's decade and of all time. People have tried to imitate it as well, but none can compare. Even the sequels, two of which are good, and the decent remake can't match it's brilliance or intensity.My rating: 4.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ambitious American ambassador Robert Thorn (an outstanding and dignified performance by the inestimable Gregory Peck) begins to suspect that something is amiss with his adopted son Damien (well played by gifted child thespian Harvey Stephens) following a troubling series of odd and fatal "accidents." Thorn and cynical photographer Keith Jennings (the always excellent David Warner) embark on an investigation which takes them all over Europe in order to uncover the truth about Damien's possibly satanic origins.Director Robert Donner and screenwriter David Seltzer give the fantastic supernatural premise a semblance of plausibility by firmly grounding said story in a believable everyday world. Moreover, Donner maintains a steady pace throughout, keeps the tone resolutely creepy and serious (there's a welcome absence of any dumb and obtrusive humor), and stages a few elaborate murder set pieces with breathtaking go-for-it verve (an impalement on a huge spike and a stunning decapitation by a large runaway pane of glass are especially effective while a cheery young nanny happily hanging herself at a birthday party proves to be genuinely shocking and disturbing). Better still, the special effects are used in an admirably judicious manner and the picture overall primarily relies on developing and sustaining a potently unsettling gloom-doom mood to get under the viewer's skin. The tension gradually builds to a nerve-wracking fever pitch and culminates in a truly harrowing last third. The uniformly sterling acting by a first-rate cast qualifies as another major asset: Peck and Lee Remick as Torn's sweet, yet frail wife Katherine bring a tremendous amount of class to the film, Billie Whitelaw gives a positively chilling portrayal of sinister governess Ms. Baylock, Patrick Troughton excels as intense priest Father Brennan, and Leo McKern contributes a neat cameo as occult expert Carl Bugenhagen. Kudos are also in order for Gilbert Taylor's glossy cinematography and Jerry Goldsmith's supremely shivery'n'spooky Oscar-winning score. A superior mainstream horror hit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damian pt. 1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the scariest of alltime of the horror movies period. it has some of the most horrifying death scenes i think of all time,, I thought this was one of Gregory Peck's better roles that he has done,, Lee Remmick did a fine job as well, loved the child who played Damian also,, but the show goes to the dogs,, those demonic devil dogs gotta love em. i thought that the explanation about Rome and the comet and the Jews was almost believable, although a stretch for me. The scene where Damian has to go to church is classic,, gotta love that one,, also where Damian runs over his mom is good to. it's unfortunate that the new Omen is basiscally a shot for shot remake, with just a few tweaks from the old one, the original Omen has a great musical score that should not be missed, it has some of the most haunting music that i've ever heard for a horror movie,, overall i give it a great thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Preaching To The Choir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At this point I feel that I might be the only person in North America who had not seen "The Omen"...until last night, that is. (Well, OK, maybe my Aunt Frici in the nursing home hasn't seen it yet either.) So permit me a moment or two while I "preach to the choir." Far from being just another "Exorcist" rip-off, "The Omen" is a literate, handsomely mounted horror picture that shows us what happens when American ambassador Gregory Peck discovers that his cute little boy is no less a personage than the Antichrist. (And you thought you had problems with YOUR 5-year-old!) Peck's presence, as well as Lee Remick's, add immeasurable class and dignity to the proceedings. The picture would have been far less an achievement without their presences, but Richard Donner's imaginative direction and Jerry Goldsmith's creepy score (incorporating what sounds like Gregorian chants) help put it over the top. Billie Whitelaw should be singled out as well, for her turn as the (literal) nanny from hell. Leo McKern, strangely uncredited, is also fine in his small but crucial role. The film contains at least half a dozen classic and violent set pieces, culminating with what might be the most suspenseful haircut in film history. But then again, the entire film is extremely suspenseful and believable, and not a little scary. My stomach was in knots by the final credits, but I'm so glad that I FINALLY got to see this modern-era horror classic. Oh, by the way, the extensive extras on this commemorative DVD are fascinating to watch, as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After This Movie, How About A Choir Concert?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this movie doesn't scare you, the music will. Is it just me, or was the music louder than the dialog in this movie? That was the biggest knock I had on this film. The dialog was so quiet, one had to strain to hear it. Then all of a sudden, we get blasted out of our seats with that choral music. The first time I heard this, it was as if someone had poured a bucket of ice water down my back.As for the movie itself, as I said, it's hard to keep track of what's going on because you can barely hear anything but Jerry Goldsmith's great, but just a little bit too loud music. I do like movies with a Biblical theme, and basing a movie on the Book of Revelations was a bold move. Not many people have the courage to even read that Book in the Bible, let alone make a movie of it. This was an admirable effort in that direction.Damien was just downright scary. (How many people since this movie came out has named their child Damien? I don't know of anybody.) That smile he has is as chilling as Jerry Goldsmith's music. That kid must have been one hell of an actor (pun definitely intended.) Many people like to compare this movie to THE EXORCIST. Please! THE EXORCIST, while having a good idea, went overboard in trying to get their point across and turned into a parody of itself. There is no comparison. This is a great thriller and even scarier than THE EXORCIST. And it tells the story better as well. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*The Omen SPOILERS* Rome, June 6, 6:00 AM: American Ambassador Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck), after finding out that his wife Kathy (Lee Remick) gave birth to a stillborn child and doesn't know it, accepts to adopt an orphan newborn boy, whose mother died while giving birth to him.Everything goes well, until the boy, who has been called Damien (Harvey Stephens)'s fifth birthday party, when Damien's nanny (Holly Palance) joyfully hangs herself in front of all the children there.From then on, things begin to get weirder and more dangerous as more accidents happen around Damien, and a photographer, Keith Jennings (David Warner) finds out that the photos he took of the people who died have clues on it as to how the pictured person will die (e.g. a diagonal line extending from the nanny's neck in a photo where she is tending to Damien).Keith and Robert, who has also noticed the weirdnesses happening, investigate about Damien's real mother and find out a shocking truth, one that the new babysitter Mrs. Baylock (Billie Whitelaw) is part of...'The Omen', in my opinion, is one of the best satanic horror movies of all time; the actors are all in part, the script works perfectly, the music is scary as hell and the direction is top-notch, and it still holds up today, unlike 'The Exorcist' which looks pretty dated and has also lost its edge of terror.It's the first of a well-thought out trilogy, even if the second and third movies are pretty weak, and has had an unnecessary third sequel (Omen IV).As it's custom nowadays, this classic too has unnecessarily been remade, but there is no way it's superior or even as good as this classic.The Omen: 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all those who wish to know more about the birth of Damien: Everything was ready, timed to perfection, the child would be born of the 6th of June at 6am. They knew Thorn would except the child, he do anything for his wife, to keep her happy and content. all they needed was a man who would kill without mercy, without thinking twice. Brennen, the priest who had come to them so long ago in his time of need, they had given him freedom, and life without sorrow. His time had come to prove himself to the dark lord. Spiletto told him of the message that had been sent from Satan. A child, his only son, would be born of a jackal on the date of 6th of June at 6am. it was their responsibility to put the boy in good hands and keep him there til such a time when he would rise to take what his father would give to him. Thorn's wife, she had wanted a child more then anything, and Thorn knew it. They had had two of their hopes gone, and now she was pregnant again and it had lasted the full nine months. She was ready for a child and would be shattered if this one left her also. B'aalock, a fellow satanist, would take care of the jackal through pregnancy and would present the child to Thorn as they had planned. Baylock, B'aalock's sister. would take care of the child when they felt his powers were starting to show. As for Brennan, he would have the hardest job of all. The killing of The boys mother and Thorn's child. Spiletto was sure he would do it, Brennan had proved that many times. The unholy night finally came and the Jackel's howls were unheard from the basement of the hospital, while Thorn's wife cried out with pain above. They called Thorn half way through the birth, to be sure he would reach them at the right moment. The children were born at the same time, both healthy. Thorn's wife, exhausted form the ordeal, fell into a deep sleep before she knew if he son was alive. she would never see her son again, at least to her knowledge. B'aalock took the child silently from the room and down to the basement, handing it to Brennan. Brennan slowly placed the child of the table beside the jackal, who was resting. Then, taking up a sharp, heavy rock, he struck at the jackal to the head, killing it. Then, one again raising the rock, aimed it at Thorns son. He struck the boy to the head, it cried out then moved no more. Brennan quickly dumped the jackals corpse in a crate, nailing it shut. Then did the same with Thorn's son, he hadn't even be named yet. Above, Thorn was jogging down a corridor to find a lone priest waiting for him, grief in his eyes. The priest told Thorn that his son was dead, his wife well, but had no knowledge of the death. He convinced Thorn, that if he loved his wife, he would take a false as his own. Thorn requested to see the boy. B'aalock was carefully preparing the boy, cleaning him, wrapping him in a blanket, checking under his jet black hair for the birthmark. She left the basement as Brennan moved the crate containing the boy's corpse towards the back door. Suddenly, he heard a cry from inside the crate. Opening it, he saw the child, still alive, crying in pain. He quickly took up the Rock again and hit the child again. After a moment, he quickly closed the crate, breathing heavily. it was over. the child was dead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some spellbinding moments but not totally credible...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For an effective chiller that has several well-executed scenes of horror, THE OMEN moves at too leisurely a pace under Richard Donner's direction. GREGORY PECK and LEE REMICK are a good pair as the parents of a little boy who turns out to be the Anti-Christ, a fact they slowly become aware of after a number of strange things start happening. The sequences where he raises the Devil, so to speak, are the most harrowing in the whole tale--but happen after too many talky moments take away some of the interest.HARVEY STEPHENS plays the malicious youngster (his blond hair dyed black) and his efforts resulted in a Golden Globe nomination as Best Actor in a Debut Role. But oddly enough, he soon disappeared from the screen and today is a successful businessman in London. However, Jerry Goldsmith's fascinating background score did win him a well-deserved Oscar for Best Scoring of a Dramatic Film.BILLIE WHITELAW is also effective as the boy's nanny, who is anything but a Mary Poppins type. She too was highly acclaimed for her sinister interpretation of a woman who has already made her own pact with the Devil.None of it is altogether convincing, but it sustains interest with its interesting camera-work and location filming. Peck is rather low-key and somber in the lead, but David WARNER as a photographer friend does nicely in a thankless supporting role and LEE REMICK does her usual fine work.Chilling stuff, perhaps a bit tame by today's standards, but worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the possessed child round 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a lot of cine buffs, the masquerade of "the Exorcist" (1973) was deemed ground-breaking enough to consider this enticing fantastic film to be a benchmark in the horror/fantasy genre but I'm not one of them. Three years later, "the Omen" steps into the breach William Friedkin's standard (for the ones who are fans of it) opened and the detractors of the film will surely qualify it as a pale mimicry of Friedkin's film, I will definitely choose Richard Donner's work which is perhaps the finest of all his career. A filmography often characterized by action-packed stories, the likes of the "Lethal Weapon" saga.So, Donner uses again some ingredients which made the success of "the Exorcist" like the child possessed by Satan who worries his surroundings and turns them to his advantage. First, it was a shrewd idea to have located the story in the American political milieu because it prepares the final sequence and the most famous one of the whole movie with sardonic humor: Damien holding the hand of the American president and grinning at him. Evil entering the White House and as the USA is the most powerful country in the world, the latter is in jeopardy. Apocalypse now indeed...As for the story, it is shot in a thrifty style. Would-be chilling special effects which plagued Friedkin's film and made it farcical weren't among Donner's priorities when he shot his film. So, special effects are kept to the minimum. It doesn't mean that "the Omen" is a total masterwork. Donner has a conspicuous taste for easy effects like the death of Damien's mother and his conventional directing sometimes stops the viewer from feeling shivers in some spooky sequences. Conventional could also be the most adequate epithet to deem the storyline as a whole. But these weaknesses don't handicap too much the thrill of the vision and as I said before: a ton of special effects wasn't Donner's priority and in spite of the scheduled dramatic progression, the film is eminently watchable.So "the Omen" is a more than valuable effort than its elder brother about the child haunted by Satan. If "the Exorcist" hadn't been created, maybe Donner's film could have had the stance of yardstick. And like its elder brother, this variation of the possessed child made crowds flock to it and caused a chain of cheesy sequels and even a remake which opened on the 06th June 2006 in the world. The choice of the date is evident. What about its quality? I will talk about it in my review devoted to it on this site.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American ambassador Robert Thorn ( Gregory Peck) and his wife (Lee Remick)adapts a baby boy named Damien whom becomes their son. Over the years as he as reached his 5th year, strange accidents start happening especially to her previous nanny which now has a new one (Billie Whitelaw) whom is getting quite use to Damien as there is a secret behind the boy that is extremely shocking! he is really the son of the devil and will set up Armageddon when he grows up.A startling, dark and Gothic horror thriller that has became one of the most popular horror movies of the 70's spawned two sequels, a recent remake and a few imitations, Damien became a recognized horror character along with Regan from "The Exorcist" back then. It's a biblical horror epic that has frightened audiences for years since then! The acting in this movie is very good even by Peck, Jerry Goldsmith's score is pure classic and some creative shocking kills like the unforgettable death of the priest makes some of today's CGI kills look like a walk in the park.Also recommended: "Rosemary's Baby", "Damien: Omen II", "The Final Conflict", "The Exorcist", "End of Days", "Constantine", "The Antichrist", "Final Destination Trilogy", "The Grudge" (American and Japanese), "Evil Dead II", "The Sentinel", "The Sixth Sense", "The Others", "Stir of Echoes", "Stigmata", "The Ninth Gate", "Seventh Sign", "Hellraiser", "Hellbound: Hellraiser II", "Angel Heart", "The Beyond", "Exorcist: The Beginning", " The Stand", "The Amityville Horror ( 1979)", "Fallen", "Making Contact ( a.k.a.

		<shortDescription>Even Better than The Exorcist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those few horror movies that you can watch repeatedly even if you are not a horror junkie. Gregory Peck was not known for doing horror films and I think that is why he was so good for the part. Too bad for Charlton Heston he didn't grab this role when it was offered to him he certainly missed the train on this one. Robert Thorn (Peck) is a U.S. Ambassador whose wife (Remick) loses her child at birth in Rome and at the suggestion of a local priest switches his dead child with a live one without his wife's knowledge. He moves his family to London and five years later his counterfeit son Damien is thrown a birthday party and all Hell brakes loose. It sets off a countdown to ultimate destruction as Thorn starts to suspect his small child Damien is evil incarnate and unveils an unholy conspiracy which may bury them all. Lee Remick is simply gorgeous and was one of the prettiest women in Hollywood. And that kid Harvey Stephens is stupendously great. I saw a trivia clip on AMC DVD/TV that said in real life he was very badly behaved while shooting the film which means he was a really good pick for Damien. This film conveys horror by inference, suggestion, and impending doom instead of cheap special effects and pea soup. It is much more scary to sense and anticipate evil rather than to just see it. As Hitchcock said nothing can create more terror than the human mind and this principle is put to full effect in The Omen. This may have been the first movie where a little kid is the antagonist and the audience is rooting against him like mad. This movie was part of the cinematic revolution where the forces of darkness are shown to have much more force and sway than their counterpart (along with The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, and The Shining) and features one Devil of a surprise ending. The Omen is the cornerstone of the horror genre and was followed by three sequels. The first is always the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Devil went down to Italy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By now, it should be clear to movie fans that the really good trifecta of Devil-themed movies are "Rosemary's Baby", "The Exorcist" and "The Omen". An obvious point is that all three deal with children, but "The Omen" takes an interesting approach. Gregory Peck and Lee Remick play Robert and Katharine Thorn, American ambassadors to Italy. Their son, Damien, was born under unusual circumstances, but they still love him. Then, the bad news comes: Damien is literally the Antichrist. Not only is this boy pure evil, but he's not afraid to get rid of anyone whom he considers a threat, namely a pesky nanny.Okay, so maybe the whole movie is sort of improbable, but after you watch it, you likely won't look at little children as totally "innocent" anymore. Whereas "The Exorcist" drew most of its terror from the really gross scenes, "The Omen" draws its terror from what we don't know, from what may be creeping beneath the surface. Among other things, it was interesting to see Gregory Peck and Lee Remick, who were usually known for more "serious" roles, star in a horror movie. Chilling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Preachy classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a classic in the horror genre. But it is also a two hour sermon touting the mainstream bible and the dogma found therein.The catholic church has amended its interpretation of the biblical book of Revelations to say that it is no longer considered a prophecy but, like much of the bible, a parable. That declaration rendered this franchise rather moot, but if you are not watching this line for the ethical and biblical implications, it is still an entertaining two hours.It is rather dated and slightly contrived, but those contrivances are easily forgiven against a backdrop canvas of excellent camera work and a musical score that will really get your heart pumping. Also present are some great performances, particularly that of little Harvey Stephens, who really hasn't done much else in the way of acting since. Greggory Peck offers up his usual professionalism as the little bugger's father and Lee Remick delivers what is probably one of her best performances.Gather all that together and you've got one well done horror flick. Completely wrapped around the monotheistic mainstream religion, this is merely a movie for the sake of entertainment. There is nothing here which is thought-provoking or enlightening. I can't help but wonder what the populace of the rest of the world (which is NOT as wholly anti-open-mindedness as is the USA) thinks of American movie makers' obsession with the neochristian devil. America seems to think it is the sole owner of that religion.How ignorant.On a brighter note, this movie spawned a good line of self-serving horror. Each installment growing more and more entrenched with the dogmatic ramblings of the bastardized Hebrew religion; each chapter decidedly more...catholic...than those before it.It may not sound like it, but I honestly enjoyed this line of movies. I just took them with a grain of salt. This particular springboard into horror rates a 7/10 on the "B" scale. That's a 5.2/10 on the "A" scale from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The funny thing about a good movie is how it can overcome its own stupidity. With CASABLANCA, it's the "letters of transit which can't be...questioned." With THE OMEN, it's the whole "666" thing. The idea that the "number of the beast" consists of three Arabic numeral sixes is extremely silly. In fact, the number expressed in modern decimal notation as 666 can be just as reasonably represented as 1010011010 or DCLXVI, depending upon which numbering system one is using.Of course, THE OMEN, unlike the superior THE EXORCIST, uses (and occasionally abuses) Christianity merely for atmosphere. The plot itself has nothing to do with actual Christian theology or Biblical eschatology (whether you accept the Evangelical "Left Behind" interpretation or not). But that's OK. Although it lacks THE EXORCIST'S intellectual and philosophical seriousness, it's still a good atmospheric horror flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>?The Omen' stars Gregory Peck as Robert Thorn, an ambassador to the United States, who substitutes his wife's stillborn baby for another without her knowledge. Although the baby, named Damien, appears to be a normal, healthy child he seems to be the centre of many strange and grisly occurrences including the death of a Priest who previously warned Robert about Damien. Robert tries to reason the situation but is finally convinced when confronted by photographer Jennings (David Warner) who has pictures with some shocking indications of the truth on them. Like the other great religious horror of the 1970's, ?The Exorcist', this movie incorporates a supposedly innocent child as a symbol of evil and succeeds almost faultlessly. A superb performance by Gregory Peck is the highlight of this movie which also features a solid storyline, a strong supporting cast (including Lee Remick) and exceptional direction from Richard Donner who makes this a shining example of how to create a slick and highly enjoyable horror/thriller. The story moves at exactly the right pace and although while watching the movie some may think it will continue forever, ?The Omen' remains entertaining and gripping throughout. What I really loved about ?The Omen' is how the story was based perfectly around actual Christian beliefs about the antichrist. Rather than make up the rules as it went along like so many other religious or demon based movies ?The Omen' stayed very close to the genuine prophecies that it seeks to portray which adds to the effect for those who have studied religion, at least that is what I would presume. ?The Omen' is much less graphic than ?The Exorcist' but is still shocking on many levels. ?The Omen' is more of a psychological horror than 'The Exorcist' (which itself succeeded in creating terror on a psychological level) which works by instructing the viewer that certain events will happen but leaving the viewer in a state of uncertainty as to whether they will happen. Although ?The Omen' has some rather grisly scenes the gore never distracts from the story and instead compliments the film beautifully. ?The Omen' is not afraid to break all the conventional horror movie rules about survival and timing so the shock-factor is increased for certain scenes while it becomes hard to tell how this film could possibly end? There we have another awe-inspiring part of the film ? the end. Gripping and intense! The final ten minutes offer one of the most powerful performances in a horror movie as well as some outstanding scripting and direction which allowed the scenes to build up and leave the viewer with a chilling closing image. Often imitated but never rivalled ?The Omen' is one of the 1970's best movies which paved the way for the big-budget flicks of the 80's such as ?Poltergeist'. Phenomenally successful at the time it seems strange that this movie has not really achieved the cult status of many lesser-films and though retaining some popularity is often neglected when talking about the great movies of horror. For those people who enjoy well acted, shocking, slick and highly artistic movies or religious-horror I heartily recommend this movie. I certainly believe this is a must-see for horror fans. My rating for ?The Omen' - 8.5/10.</fullReview>

And it is a very horrific movie to boot.Patrick Troughton is great as Father Brennan, the doomed priest who tries to convince Peck of the evil in Damien, and his death was one of the better deaths in the genre. The revelations of Damien's true "mother" and Peck's real son are probably the most horrific moments in the film...there is a subtlety to the terror that just connects with you.David Warner is also outstanding as the photographer who tries to help Peck, and Leo McKern is great, as always, in the small role he has in the film.</fullReview>

Skinny and bearded, the young rock singer looked like a befuddled, blue-collar Christ, yearning and confused at the same time. "There's got to be something I'm not saying, man. Some basic human truth I'm not telling. All these people I sing about, they're not real. They're not tragic. They're just poor and desperate."The big black man chuckled. "Maybe they're not poor and desperate enough."Just then a silver-haired stranger walked into the bar. His tailored raincoat and Oxford suit marked him as the Manhattan type. But the look in his eyes showed he had gone way past the place where the light of hope shines into the Jersey Tunnel."Buy you a drink, man?" The Boss didn't smoke or drink himself, but he collected stories the way Six-fingered Sally collected bottle caps. This guy? An epic in the making. "I'm Ambassador Robert Thorn," the man said stiffly. He took off his raincoat and sat down on a bar stool. "And you are?""They call me the Boss, man. Don't you read magazines? I was just on the cover of Time and Newsweek.""I've been away for the last six months," the stranger said, his voice somber. He knocked back a shot of whiskey like a factory worker who'd just lost his job after twenty five years. "I've been living in London, at the Court of St. James. My wife and I were happy there. We had everything we wanted. And then I found out my son was really the son of the devil.""Man, that's tough." The Boss knew all about fathers and sons. "Did he hit you? Did he leave home?"Sadly, Ambassador Thorn shook his head. "No, he's only six. But horrible accidents started happening as soon as he was old enough to walk. First his nanny hung herself. Then a priest who tried to warn me about him got impaled by a lightning rod in the middle of a thunderstorm. And then Jennings . . . then this photographer was beheaded in a freak glass-truck accident just after we uncovered proof that Damien . . . that my son . . . was the Beast of Revelations.""Oh, man." Deep inside the Boss felt an incredible stirring. "Those bad breaks, man, they can really make you lose your faith. So what does your old lady think about all this? My old man would have killed me a million times if my old lady hadn't stepped in.""My wife is dead," Thorn said bluntly. "First Damien ran her over with a tricycle. Then his new nanny pushed her out the hospital window. I think I'm going to have to kill her too." "Kill her too?" The Boss put his hand on the older man's arm. "Hold on now, Robert. I've seen guys from the neighborhood go to Vietnam, and they did not all come back. And the ones that did come back were never the same. Hey, where did you get those knives?" Thorn's suit coat had fallen open. "Those are sacred knives. I must go now. I must rid the world of this incredible evil called . . . my son.""No, man, don't do it! It doesn't have to be that way!" The older man shambled off alone into the night, ignoring the Boss' pleas. "Hey, man! I know it seems like you're going down a long dark tunnel, that nobody's hurting but you. But if you could just believe, mister, believe in the faith that save us all from the darkness on the edge of town, then you might . . . we might . . . aw, man. He's gone."A few years later, in front a gigantic stadium full of screaming people, the caring blue-collar Messiah made a hoarse, heartfelt tribute to the fallen Ambassador. Well they told the Ambassador he'd have to kill his son,And they stuck him with knives, said he couldn't use a gun,He got too drunk mixing prophecies and Vatican wine, Pulled a knife, stabbed his boy, now they call him Thorny 99Down in the part of town, where when you hit an angel you don't stop,Thorny's waving his knives around, threatening to blow his top,When an off-duty Nanny crept up on him from behind, Outside of the Club Pitchfork she tried to mess with Thorny 99.Well, the devil came to earth to do evil, But he came with an innocent face, Thorny knew it was right to kill him, He had to find a holy place,Well he went to the church, and he laid his son down,When the cops started shooting ? he died without a sound.And a little boy was smiling, when they put his daddy in the ground,Thorny died doing evil, but it was goodness that let him down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Quintessential Horror Film With Atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An American ambassador (Gregory Peck) learns to his horror that his son (Harvey Stephens) is actually the literal Antichrist.Some people have compared this film to "The Exorcist", another Satanic film released around the same time. Others have compared it to the remake (which, good or bad, owes its existence to this film). I have no interest in doing either.The film stands on its own merits, with the solid cast of Gregory Peck (a legend) and Lee Remick. David Warner, perhaps the last great horror actor, plays a significantly large role in the second half. And even the minor characters -- especially Father Brennan -- carry the picture. This is not to mention the director, Mr. Donner, whose carry only went up from here.What sells this film is the atmosphere. Jerry Goldsmith has an incredible score (those Latin chants are key). And even after going more than a decade without seeing the picture, the death scenes stood starkly in my mind as fresh as if they had just happened. This is one of the horror greats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It should rather be called The Omens as there are plenty of them leading up to the birth and accession to power of anti-Christ. The atmosphere and setup comes in on the same lines as The Exorcist though it is just dealt from the opposite perspective. It is quite audacious for its time to have the main antagonist of the movie to be a 8 year old kid.Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) is a diplomat assuming the role of an Ambassador to different countries on behalf of the U.S. government. When he was assigned in Italy, his wife Katherine (Lee Remick) delivers a stillborn, the head priest of the hospital offers a just born whose mother dies at child birth and keeps this truth from Katherine. After some strange events and his talk with a persistent priest about their child being an Antichrist, he tries to get to the bottom of this with the help of a photographer who seemed to have recorded some of these strange events.When I first saw a snippet of this movie on TV, I was thrilled; especially the scene where the nanny commits suicide during a birthday party. It felt raw and intriguing at the same time. Gregory Peck does an excellent job as a practical person unable to make sense to the accusations on his child, either by his wife or the priest. The writers include some thrilling moments like the attack by dogs at the cemetery to go along with the investigative mode the story takes upon. The background score is intense though a bit loud. Billie Whitelaw plays the role of a nanny who is like an apostle to help the Antichrist gives a stage like performance which could have been a lot better without her closeup weird looks. Screenplay and editing is neat but the end felt a bit too hasty to wrap things up. The kid though actually doesn't do any acting has the perfect look of both sweet and mischief.More a good thriller movie than a horror one. Fun to watch nevertheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Creepy: "When the Jews return to Zion / And a comet rips the sky / And the Holy Roman Empire rises, / Then You and I must die. / From the eternal sea he rises, / Creating armies on either shore, / Turning man against his brother / 'Till man exists no more." Fake quotation from the Bible of some Yeats-like poem, hardly supported by the Book of Revelation. Apart from that bigot filiation to texts that are absolutely transcending in their inspiration and here reduced to some superstitious unfounded belief. We have to go over this vision and the unacceptable use of dogs to protect the son of Satan, the Antichrist, a direct allusion to the dogs of Allah, to the Moslem creed actually more rather than less hinted at with Jerusalem and the discovery of the roots of Christianity on a background voice-over of a Muezzin calling for prayer. Then the film is an archetypical matrix for so many films to come that will describe the coming of the Antichrist. Yet no film will ever be as short and as powerful as Yeats' "The Second Coming". The film is a masterpiece in cinematographic form, though it is rather easy and uses some techniques (hiatus and ellipse) that are so common that they need some renewing to be as effective as they could be. That is to say that this film has aged because it uses techniques of cinematographic story telling that have been so much improved and multiplied over the last three decades that they seem slightly weak in this film. In a way that's a shame because it remains a matrix of that type of horror stories but it has lost a lot of its bleakness and terrifying effect. I even find it weak in some sections, like the killing of the devilish son. Weak and tamed and softened and many other things. Thirty years ago killing a child of five could seem horrible. Today, I just wonder if it is not something we are born with. After all the genocides of the last twenty years and all the suicide bombers, even at times women with child, we have the right to wonder if that insanity is not in-grown in our memory from beyond birth and death, like some genetic inheritance, some genetic re-incarnation. I was expecting something a lot more powerful because I will definitely consider that the religious gibberish in the film is just what it is "gibberish". John did a lot better in his days, even if he was not the only one to hold the pen that wrote the Book of Revelation.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

True terror is personal; you have to care about the characters to feel the fear. With the exception of Gregory Peck, the actors were given too little to work with to convey any kind of emotional depth. Lee Remick's character is particularly thin.

The music by Jerry Goldsmith might very well be one of the best horror scores till date.

		<shortDescription>Classic in Gothic Horror Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1976 horror film scored a hit with both critics and cinema-goers alike who had embraced a deep interest in Gothic horror and its history. It has a first-rate cast, superb acting, brilliant shock tactics and a soundtrack to send shivers down your spine whatever your state of mind! The cast is great, especially Gregory Peck, who is just a brilliant actor, and also Patrick Troughton (Klove from Scars Of Dracula) who brilliantly plays Father Brennan or the especially creepy nanny Mrs. Baylock (played by Billie Whitelaw). We also get to see a young David Warner and Lee Remick. Also remarkable: Harvey Stephens who plays Damien. Charlton Heston, Roy Scheider, Dick Van Dyke and William Holden were considered for the lead role of American ambassador Robert Thorn, but turned down the role. Also, Jerry Goldsmith won an Oscar for best original score and the demonic singing adds a lot of atmosphere to the story. It sounds impressive on the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track, as do some of the more subtle sounds such as gravel crunching underfoot. The track is front-heavy and a little quiet, but it does the job.The original part of the trilogy remains one of the best horror movies ever made, but it won't appeal to everyone. The pacing will seem slow by today's standards and the story relies on suspense, characterization and acting ability, rather than gore and special effects. Well worth seeing if you want to see how the genre has developed over the past four decades.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

If you a fan of horror films and have not seen the original Omen (1976) then by all means find a copy of it to watch - you will not be disappointed. I highly recommend this movie.The casting in incredible - everyone is believable. Harvey Stephens as Damien is just amazing... most child actors are not that grand but Harvey is simply fantastic.The musical scoring by Jerry Goldsmith is just as haunting as the film itself. The directing and the story - the story - will leave chills within you for days after watching this one.What I like best about this film is the fact there is little gore in it. It's just a darn good story - lots of psychological thrills and horrors with just a handful on camera graphic scenes - just enough to keep it terrifying without over doing it. A class act horror film.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Omen (1976): Dir: Richard Donner / Cast: Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, David Warner, Billie Whitelaw, Harvey Stephens: Chilling horror film that references events to come. Gregory Peck and Lee Remick plays Robert and Katherine Thorn, Ambassadors to Great Britain. After his son is pronounced dead he is convinced to adopt a boy named Damien. Strange occurrences follow including the hanging death of the nanny and the impalement of a priest who attempted to warn Thorn that his son is really the Anti-Christ. Grand first feature by Richard Donner with a screenplay full of Biblical lore. Peck is a strong presence as Thorn, attempting to understand what he is dealing with while everything falls apart. He is soon presented with several daggers to seal the deal. Remick's emotional state shatters until her unborn child dies in a innovative fall from a railing. David Warner plays a photographer caught up in the search for answers when strange marking appear on photos. Harvey Stephens plays the weak yet menacing child Anti-Christ. The one flaw would be the awkward behavior of Billie Whitelaw as the replacement nanny. Actions such as bringing in a dog unannounced or questioning the authority of the Thorns should have warranted her termination. Tremendous special effects and glorious locations highlight a theme that reveals the reality of evil but the reminder of the good to come. Score: 9 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a teenager growing up in the 21st century, I have been witness to horror films after horror films that consistently, for the most part, are very cheesy, unoriginal, and downright stupid. In the modern age of special effects being more important than the actual acting, more and more unknown actors are being placed in horror films and given credit where credit is not due.Contrary to all of these films, The Omen truly shocked the hell out of me. Very few films have been able to do this. Most of the other horror films that have genuinely scared me rely on gimmicky jumping- out scenes. The Omen is one of those films that may not have many jumping-out scenes, the twisted, Satanic plot itself is enough to scare the pants off of you.So, if you're into a jaw-dropping plot, stellar acting performances, and frights leaving you checking behind your shower curtain every time you go to the bathroom (I'm guilty of this), The Omen is most certainly for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mysterious deaths surround an American ambassador. Could the child that he is raising actually be the anti-Christ? The devil's own son? Robert and Katherine Thorn seem to have it all. They are happily married and he is the US Ambassador to Great Britain, but they want more than to have children. When Katharine has a stillborn child, Robert is approached by a priest at the hospital who suggests that they take a healthy newborn whose mother has just died in childbirth. Without telling his wife he agrees. After relocating to London, strange events - and the ominous warnings of a priest - lead him to believe that the child he took from that Italian hospital is evil incarnate. Roger Ebert wrote "As long as movies like "The Omen" are merely scaring us, they're fun in a portentous sort of way. But when they get thoughtful . . . well, how about the movie's interpretation of the Biblical prophecy that the son of Satan will return when the Jews return to Zion, a comet is seen in the sky, and the Roman Empire rises again. Right enough with the first two, the characters agree. But -- the Roman Empire? Peck nods solemnly: "That would be the European Common Market." The Omen is one of the classics of the '70s and often underrated. It is the definition of pure evil in its simplest form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The devil is in the form of child</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen is a film that has won over the years the cult classic status.It is a well cast film with excellent actors, and filmed in a very sober and professional by Richard Donner.But above all is the original and terrifying story. In a first moment may seem topical, the eternal struggle between good and evil, but in this case the evil is represented in the figure of a child, Damien, who happens to be none other than the Antichrist, but the concept which is given here is fascinating.For evil appears as an invisible, pervasive and lethal element in the form of accidents in appearance may be the result of chance and luck. These accidents have yet appear to affect only certain chosen victims that may hamper the rise of the son of Satan. Sure, the child itself is harmless, but those dark forces who monitor it a mortal being to those around him, a being whose only goal will be the maximum possible personal power to dominate the world, in this case the president of the United States, bringing the Apocalypse.The performances scratch at a high level. Especially the kid, whose dark and deep look combined with white and angelic face, commands respect and fear, barely utter more than two words, it seems, yet does not seem human, Gregory Peck, as usual, recreates a character with seriousness and firmness and a point of desperation that increasingly emphasizes the film, the beautiful Lee Remick, who suffers with seeing the calamities that are happening to him, and David Warner, convenient and ally photographer as you go Peck, and a brutal end in every way.Special effects, despite having many years, still resulting great and realistic. They look better and more frightening than those generated by computer. Scenes such as the beheading of poor Warner by a sheet of glass keeps impressing authentic. I really do not know because the cinema today is increasingly leaving aside what ¨ artisan, when it is clear, that often achieves an equal or even better effect. And here's the proof, since the photographer's death Remake not even half hits. There must be someSpecial mention Jerry Goldsmith, composing a successful and thrilling music. Keeps well the bewildering atmosphereThe story also achieves something difficult it is to keep the intrigue and tension for almost the whole film, culminating in a climax that is frontally against the concept happy ending. Donner showed great ability to shoot Jan this genre and it's a shame not to do more similar work.This is definitely the Omen, a powerful film that skillfully blend, suspense, intrigue and supernatural horror, and even adventure could also say, by the two forced companions, visiting several places in the world, with a concept and novel approach to the devil and evil itself, and although it has aged enough, has not ceased to be a source of inspiration, or rather exploited for hundreds of films, such as the idea of an evil invisible and catastrophic adopted in the highly entertaining and famous ¨ Final Destination.Do not miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember first seeing this as a kid. What a great story line and plot. The remake was good too, but not as good as this version. Truly the best horror film depicting the anti Christ. The Omen even tops over Rosemary's Baby. Exciting from the beginning till the very end. Damien (the anti Christ), was born from a demonic jackal, and adopted by the U.S. ambassador to England, Robert Thorn. Although Thorn doesn't realize that he adopts the devil's child, he chose to adopt one (whom he thinks is just a human infant), because he was told that his biological son dies as a stillborn child. He also kept this adoption business a secret from his wife so that she wouldn't be disappointed. Later on during the film, he soon discovers the horrifying truth about the death of his biological son. His biological son was killed by demons. Truly convinced by a photographer, a priest, and some other guy who lives in the very spot where Christianity first started, it's up to Robert Thorn to do what is nessacery. Kill the anti Christ child before he rises to power and fulfills the Book of Revelation.</fullReview>

It borrows from The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby but offers enough on its own to overlook that. Richard Donner's direction is very good and a cast led by vets Gregory Peck and Lee Remick does a fine job with sometimes schlocky material. Some of the impact and shock of certain scenes has been lessened by time, as one might expect. But the overall intensity of the film holds up well I think. There are some points where the film drags and the overall resolution to the story is a tad predictable. Not the specifics exactly but the tone; I knew halfway through it would be one of those movies that ends "that way." I think you'll realize what I mean as you watch it. Still, it's one of the biggest horror staples from the 70s and one of those films you just have to see at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Birth of The Antichrist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How will the end of the world come about? If Christ is lord then who is his enemy? What or who would give birth to such a thing?This is something that Director Richard Donner and Writer David Seltzer tried to convey in one of horrors most astonishing and shocking movies The Omen, a movie about the child Antichrist and his family, the " prophecies" surrounding said child and who if at all can stop him.Robert Thorn(Gegory Peck) and his wife Katherine Thorn(Lee Remick), have a child, on the morning of June 6th at 6 AM, the child is not alive, he only breathes only once, Robert Thorn is told this by the kindly Father Spiletto(Martin Benson), but he is told there is another child whose mother died in child birth at the same time. The child has no family to go to and the hospital is willing to let the Thorns go home with it and the mother need never know. The child's name is Damien (Harvey Stphens, his only role until the 2006 remake in which he makes a small cameo), the thorns adopt him as their ownFast forward five years, strange things have been happening with Damien all his life, he is no normal child, and he is about to celebrate his fifth birthday, the young Nanny(Holly Palance, whom they give no actual name to the role for) is attached to Damien so much so that she will not give him to his mother when she is asked, reluctantly she does, and this sets off events in the movie that are highly disturbingA lot of people complain about the movie not being horror, to me it is horror but not gory, as were many that came out during the seventies and early eighties an era of horror that I think is the Golden age of it or the resurgence of it, because these years gave rise to many franchises that are known today, including The Omen, The Exorcist, and the list goes on. These were the years that horror really shined before a lot of the bad acting gore and sex interrupted it. The Omen is an example of psychological horror at its best, from its cast which includes Grgory Peck, whom is best known for his role in this film and the TV miniseries The Blue and the Grey as President Lincoln which chronicles the US Civil war. The only sad thing about this aside from a lot of the bad things that happened on set is that Harvey Stephens never went on to really shine and I'm sorry but the kid had a career before him.I like this movie because of the fact that it has no blood or gore, all of the scares are in the mind, and yes I will admit I will watch a gory film just look at the Saw series one of my personal favorites! This is the way that horror should be done, and had been done; this movie alone is a shining example of a mind freaking film. I highly recommend the original Omen for anybody who loves good psychological horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel that The Omen is one of the best horrors ever made. Robert and Katherine Thorn seem to have it everything. He is the US Ambassador to Italy except for one thing, they do not have children. When Katharine has a stillborn child. The day is the 6th of June and it is 6.00am. Robert is approached by a priest at the hospital to adopt a baby boy who has no parents.Without telling his wife he agrees to to so, Without her knowledge, he adopt another baby. The boy is called Damien and they relocate to London, A few years later, deaths begin to happen. The child's nanny hangs herself and a priest is speared to death in a freak accident. It turns out the child is the son of Satan. The warnings that the a priest told him, lead him to believe that the child he took from that Italian hospital is evil. I feel that it is one of the greatest horrors that was ever made, and is still as creepy to this day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very chilling tale of the Antichrist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read another comment on this movie saying that it is in a book of the 50 worst films ever...how is that possible? This movie is very well done and one of the better horror movies of the 1970's in that it has a rather interesting story and a really good evil little child. The story has a husband and wife experiencing the loss of their child, I think it was during pregnancy or shortly thereafter. Thankfully (well not really thankfully) a man comes and lets the man have a child that is apparently an orphan or something. Well they take the kid and raise him as their own...not sure, but the mother may have been unaware that her child died, but do not quote me on that. Well during a birthday party there nanny quits in very extreme fashion, but she still shows a soft side for Damien (the little boy now about four) and they have to hire a new nanny and they get a great new dog too. Well before you know it strange things begin to happen as a reporter and a priest begin to realize something is wrong and it is not to long before the father suspects something is up with his son as well. Nice movie, a couple of good kills and that creepy music that accompanies all satanic horror movies to really make for a good atmosphere and mood. The sequels would not be nearly as good or effective, however they are both much better than the Exorcist sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Smartly Written Horror Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I like about The Omen is that instead of relying on gore and jump scares. It is more of a psychological thriller than anything else and all of the scares work because of that. Richard Donner's direction is very good considering that this was his first major film, the angles are inventive and one of the things I really liked about the direction was that he focused on the eyes a lot. For a horror film this film attracted a lot of brilliant actors and actresses and I think that this is one of Gregory Peck's most honest and memorable performances, I also like Lee Remeck's vulnerability. The kid they cast as Damien was very creepy and the character of the nanny was enough to keep me up the first time I saw it. There are some plot holes that I have never really understood, for instance I don't get how a human boy can come from a Jackal but that's really my only complaint about the film. The ending is brilliant and I really like the fact that the producer's decided to keep the kid alive. Definitely rent this or even buy it but be sure to get the two disc edition that has a very informative commentary and very entertaining documentary about the making of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If one's fond of a film providing straight answers don't watch the original Omen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer's the tip of the iceberg start of the head trip I go through every time watch the Omen. I'm very certain others will undergo degree of rethinking, whether a first or not first time watching this movie.If Donner was attempting to deliberately mislead and/or confuse his audience he succeeded with me. It's a very complicated tale calling one to dig deeper in terms of events, motivations--Uhhh...who is calling the shots with the deaths? Either first introduced to a character or at some point later on, I found my perceptions going all over the place; he or she was crazy, evil--scheming--Everyone except Damien. If the adage "look out for the quiet ones", was placed in dictionary and I had control of how the meaning is defined I'd select the original Damien as one of movie history's finest examples. Way I see it real outwardly scary thing from Damien's way surface wise is his resemblance to both parents. "Eyes around the color of Katherine's"; Hair shade, eyebrows like Robert's" proceed on.The power of the original film and what the remake sorely lacks--this husband and wife love each other and adore their "son". Robert and Kathering are not a stupid couple; they are naive and loving as they're wealthy and other than the photographer, the researcher guy and the 1st nanny it's revealed they've been betrayed at nearly every turn. Donner appeared to me keeping the shift from happy to tragic for Damien's parents so vague, I'm not sure at what point their downfall begins. And his handling Damien is nothing sort of ground breaking. There's nothing this boy does that can't be pointed elsewhere or dismissed as he's just a kid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psychological horror at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic horror film is always defined as the one that leaves a trademark on viewers' minds. But you also need lots of ingredients to make it work: a clever plot, good acting, chilly music, spectacular special effects and, of course, a great villain. And I must say The Omen is my favorite dish in the psychological horror menu. The first time I saw it (it was a Friday night) I didn't think it was a great deal, but when I went to bed, I still had "Ave Stani" in my head and my eyes wide open. Then I decided to watch it once more, but after that time, I couldn't stop watching. Of all the ingredients I listed at the beginning, the most notorious and wonderful of the movie was Goldsmith's Oscar-winning score. But of course, it doesn't steals credit from Peck and Stephens' ever-lasting performances, the well-crafted thrills and the surprising finale. Even though it is considered the less valued of the 70's Horror Holy Trinity (The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby are the other 2), I think is the most enjoyable of those 3.***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Omenious!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really like the sober style of this movie, and how it tells a pretty garish and over-the-top story with a minimum of special effects. It is also very convincing in how it paints a cute child as the incarnation of evil which has to be slaughtered to save the world -- and is therefore not exactly recommended viewing for paranoid schizophrenics. The child's evilness is related convincingly without resorting to gimmicks such as glowing eyes-SFX or stuff flying through the air. Last but not least, the Omen is a classic which ought to be seen just because of the large impact it has had on popular culture. The acting is also very good.Unfortunately the story-telling isn't all that great, and especially in the segment when the ambassador is trying to get to the bottom of his son's origin I couldn't make sense of what was going on -- who is that photographer, why did the hospital burn down, etc. And it never comes out why the movie is called "The Omen" in the first place.But still, it's the rare example of a scary movie which is enjoyable, intelligent -- and really scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very atmospheric with a great chilling score makes the Original Omen a must for horror fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one spooky movie. It is filled with great atmosphere and dread. The musical score is one of the best with chants included that just add to the oncoming horror. The Omen is not a gory film, even though there are a few shocking scenes, but more of a mood piece that lets the horror build from the beginning, until escalating into one of the most chilling endings ever.Robert Thorne (Gregory Peck) has just discovered that his child has died at birth. A priest at the hospital talks him into accepting another baby who was born at the same time whose mother died at childbirth. He never tells his wife Katherine (Lee Remick) of the switch, and together they raise the child as their own.Strange ominous things start happening, and on Damien's fifth birthday they come to the front with the death of Damien's nanny in one of the most shocking scenes in horror movie history. Things start escalating as more strange deaths occur to those people who are a threat to the boy. A priest named Father Brennan (Patrick Troughton) warns Thorne of the danger. Thorne's response is to ignore him at first, but as things become weirder, he finally decides to listen to what the priest has to say.On top of all this, a sinister nanny named Mrs. Baylock (Billie Whitelaw in a terrific performance) replaces the old nanny, and you know almost right away that there's something not right with this woman. At around the same time, a photographer named Keith Jennings (David Wariner) notices that his pictures are showing ominous shadows of what appear to be a foreshadowing of certain character's deaths. He approaches Thorne with this news, and together they try to get to the bottom of the mystery of Damien. I need not say anymore.This was Richard Donner's directorial debut, and it shows, even at an early stage in his career, that he was going to be a great one. The mood, atmosphere, the haunting score which won an academy award, were all great. The pacing is phenomenal, and his use of using wind to punctuate the score in many scenes only makes the movie that much more sinister and creepy.The acting for the most part was rather good, though Peck and Remick show no real chemistry as a married couple. Harvey Stephens as the young Damien was the perfect choice for this movie, with his haunting eyes and sinister smiles. David Wariner as the photographer and Patrick Troughton as Father Brennan were both good choices as well.The Omen is not the perfect movie. The scenes with Peck and Remick seemed forced as if the two really didn't like each other and were just playing a part, and I kinda didn't like how the movie made the devil seem more powerful than God, but I guess with being a horror movie, you have to take what you can.There are a few gruesome scenes for gore hounds (including a shocking decapitation), but nothing that can compare to today's horror films. This movie relies more on mood and atmosphere, unlike those many gore movies I just talked about which offer no real suspense whatsoever. The Omen is one of the best known movies dealing with the devil. It is also considered a classic by many. I wouldn't quite put it in the classic stage, but it is ten times better than most of the drivel we get today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gregory Peck, What Hath Thou Wrought?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually prefer my horror to be of the psychological, creepy variety, but even though the approach taken in "The Omen" is to bludgeon you with shock effects, it's still one damn scary movie.Gregory Peck classes up this movie mightily just by being in it, and he does tremendous work as Roger Thornhill, a U.S. senator who becomes the unwitting father to Damien, aka the AntiChrist. Most of the movie is focused on Thornhill's reluctance to accept the overwhelming case laid out against his son, and then the hair-raising finale finds him dragging Damien to a church to do away with him before the authorities, who of course don't know the true nature of the circumstances, can stop him."The Omen" is staged as a series of outrageous scare scenes, many of them revolving around the death of someone it's more convenient to Damien not to have around. Thus his nanny hangs herself at his birthday party, leaving the door open for a mysterious and much more sinister nanny to appear and take care of him. A priest who's on to some of what's going on gets skewered by a church steeple. Damien's own mother (Lee Remick) takes a tumble, first off a second story balcony and then out of a hospital window. And in the film's most famous scene, a photographer who has been unraveling the mystery of who Damien is is beheaded by a sheet of glass.But the film's not all schlock effects. It's well written and paced, and the screenwriters take a wise approach to the material -- it's as much mystery as it is horror film. And there's something hugely creepy about the fact that Damien isn't directly responsible for any of the film's black magic. He's too young yet to know what he is or what power he has, and there are demonic forces around him that are making sure he stays protected, but which we the audience never see. In this way, "The Omen" is far scarier to me than "The Exorcist," which treats the subject of demonic possession so literally.I'd put this in my list of top ten scariest films.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent tale of horror and suspense!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the dominant faiths of the Western hemisphere, the Abrahamic religions (mainly Christianity and Judaism) have played an important role as source of inspiration for many art forms through the centuries. In the narrative arts, they have inspired all kinds of stories, as their cosmology is so complex that can be used in almost everything, from moral fables to epic tales. Obviously, they have also inspired many horror stories, mainly because the three have a definitive personification of evil in the figure of the Devil, which makes an excellent villainous character due to its many different traits. Naturally, the Devil and its followers have been villains in horror films since almost the beginnings of cinema, however, it was during the decades of the 60s and 70s when three of the most influential horror movies about the Devil were made: "Rosemary's Baby", "The Exorcist", and "The Omen"."The Omen" begins in Rome on June 6, 1966, when American ambassador Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) receives the news that his new son has been stillborn. Devastated by the news, Thorn worries about how will this affect his wife Katherine (Lee Remick), so when he is offered the chance to adopt a newborn baby whose mother died giving birth to him, he accepts and decides not to tell a word to his wife. Years go by and everything seems happy for the Thorn family, with Robert quickly ascending in the political arena while his son, named Damien (Harvey Stephens) grows up apparently normally. However, on Damien's fifth birthday, his young Nanny (Holly Palance) hangs herself mysteriously in front of everyone. This will be only the first of many strange events surrounding Damien, making Robert begin to suspect that there's something unnatural in his son.Written by David Seltzer, "The Omen" mixes drama, horror and suspense by mixing cleverly an apocalyptic theme with a concept that was very popular in horror stories during the 60s and the 70s: the "evil child". While obviously inspired by the success of "The Exorcist" and "Rosemary's Baby", Seltzer gives to his story a new angle closer in spirit to movies like "Village of the Damned", as in "The Omen", the kid is not a victim or a tool of the supernatural evil, but truly the embodiment of evil. Due to this, Seltzer wisely bases most of the movie's drama around the dilemma that consumes Damien's father, who can't help but see innocence in his beloved son, as well as in the consequences of his doubts and his search for answers. This serious approach, together with strong character development, give the film a powerful sense of realism, which in turn truly makes it a haunting experience.With "The Omen", director Richard Donner had the first major success of his career, and it's not difficult to see why, as while Seltzer's script is truly inspired, credit should go to Donner as the man responsible for "The Omen"'s overall style. Knowing that the strength of the script lays in the realism of its human drama, Donner keeps a restrained style in "The Omen", and handles the supernatural themes with a subtle elegance that helps to create a haunting atmosphere of dread that fits nicely within the apocalyptic theme of the film. While all we see is a little child, Donner skillful use of Gilbert Taylor's cinematography and the eerie score by Jerry Goldsmith, makes it seem as if it was truly the beginning of the end of the world. Donner's directing of his cast also plays an instrumental role in this, as he brings out strong and realistic performances out of them.Leading the cast is Gregory Peck, delivering a terrific performance as U.S. ambassador Robert Thorn, the unsuspecting adoptive father of the Antichrist. As usual, Peck gives his character a lot of humanity, as well as his commanding presence. While Peck is initially a bit wooden in his performance, this kind of fits nicely in his role as an upcoming politician who must take the most difficult decision a father has to face. As Thorne's wife Katherine, Lee Remick is equally as effective as Peck, playing Damien's troubled mother with great realism. However, it is Billie Whitelaw who steals the movie as the sinister Mrs. Baylock, Damien's new nanny who is completely willing to do whatever is necessary to help Damien to rule the world. Whitelaw's performance is truly haunting, and while a bit over-the-top at times, she portrays one of the best horror villains of the 70s.It's pretty easy to criticize the many inconsistencies between the movie and the biblical sources that inspired its main plot, however, to label the film as pretentious or inaccurate in its portrayal of Christian imagery would be pretty ignorant and ultimately pointless, as "The Omen" never intends to be a representation of any biblical story or theological prophecy, as it's only a fictional tale of horror and suspense inspired by them. What truly can be criticized about the film are the small but numerous plot holes that appear from time to time through the film, certainly minor yet noticeable problems that could had been easily avoided with a bit more of care in the development of the script. The movie's extremely slow pace doesn't help in this, as while it allows Donner more development for his characters, it also makes the movie be a bit boring at times.It's difficult not to compare this movie to "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Exorcist", as the fact that "The Omen" was obviously inspired by those two masterpieces of horror is hard to ignore. But even when it may come as inferior when compared to those classics, "The Omen" still is one of the best horror films produced by a major studio during the 70s, thanks in part to the classy style Donner added to the film. It's true that "The Omen" hasn't aged well, but more than 30 years after its release, it remains a powerful and haunting experience. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satanic Horror at it's purest form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great addition to the Satan / Religious Horror frenzy of the 70's, The Omen sets around Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) who adopts a little boy. He takes the baby to his wife - Kathy (Lee Remick) who doesn't know of her son's death and they name him - Damien. When the boy completes 6 years old, his nanny commits suicide by hanging herself from the roof of the Thorn's country manor, during Damien's birthday party. A priest from Rome knows the truth and tries to warn the now, Embassador Thorn from the evil, but shortly after, gets killed in front of the house of God. Hell breaks loose and now, along with a photographer, Robert must dig into the past to find out the truth behind Damien's mysterious birth and if he is really the Antichrist. With great acting, lots of atmosphere, nice cinematography and an intelligent screenplay, The Omen is a film that holds up all these years, still remaining as shocking and as terrifying as it was back in the day. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Have no fear, little one... I am here to protect thee."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The extraordinary success of William Friedkin's 'The Exorcist' in 1973 triggered a surge of (usually cheaply-made) horror films centering on Satanic possession or demonic children. Of these films, the best of the bunch is surely Richard Donner's 'The Omen,' which took a very simple horror concept and gave it an air of respectability through an experienced cast, excellent writing and a terrifyingly apocalyptic soundtrack from Jerry Goldsmith.When the only son of Richard and Katherine Thorn (acting veteran Gregory Peck and Lee Remick) dies within moments of his birth, Richard makes the difficult decision of secretly switching his child with that of a newly-arrived orphan. Young Damien (Harvey Stephens) grows into a quiet and adorable five-year-old, the only child in a powerful American political family. However, it is at this point that Richard notices some mystifying oddities about his young son. People around him begin to die in horrible ways: a young nanny hangs herself, a cautionary old priest is impaled by a long metal rod blown from the roof of a church. Richard Thorn, with the help of photographer Keith Jennings (David Warner), slowly begins to suspect the horrible truth ? that his adopted son is the offspring of Satan, the literal Antichrist, destined to doom every last human being on the planet.Coming into this film, it seemed odd that an actor as famous and respected as Gregory Peck had chosen to star in what looked to be a pretty average horror fare. However, there is certainly more to 'The Omen' than initially meets the eye, and Peck's acting is integral to this. Perhaps because his performance as Atticus Finch in 'To Kill A Mockingbird' is so strongly ingrained in cinematic culture, Peck's character exudes such earnestness and integrity that we can only sympathise with his impossible plight, and are wholeheartedly convinced that the killing of a young child is the only way to reach a happy conclusion. After all, young Damien is not even human, is he? Young Harvey Stephens is excellent as the devilish youngster, switching effortlessly between his violent fits of satanic anger and the quiet, innocent pleading of a terrified child. Lee Remick, the delightfully-evil Billie Whitelaw, David Warner and Patrick Troughton also give very solid performances that help make the film as good as it is.Seventeen-time nominee Jerry Goldsmith won his only Oscar for 'The Omen,' a accolade that was certainly not undeserved. The intensity of the film's dramatic scenes is essentially doubled with the addition of Goldsmith's score, which features a strong choral segment, with a memorably foreboding Latin chant. The refrain of the chant goes as follows: "Sanguis bibimus, corpus edimus, tolle corpus Satani {We drink the blood, we eat the flesh, raise the body of Satan}," interspersed with cries of "Ave Satani!" and "Ave versus Christus" (Latin, "Hail, Satan!" and "Hail, Antichrist!").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't like any of the horror movies simply because its violence, blood, and that loving of killing any thing with material beauty and that is the kind of horror which I really really hate.. But when we are talking about a movie like (The Omen - 1976) it is not the same..Here we have great stars : (Gregory Peck) is the best star you can get for the role of (Robert Thorn), and (Lee Remick) is magnificent just like her beauty. There is also (Jerry Goldsmith) himself and MR. Superman, Lethal Weapon, Assassins's (Richard Donner), he is one of my favorite directors.You will find too smooth but deep cinematography by (Gilbert Taylor), there are lots of good scenes like the cemetery scene as one example.I think it was the time that big producers in Hollywood wanted horror movies for family without any nudity, sexual violence, nor bad language. I have just a little thing to say : The kid (Harvey Stephens) as Damien (6 years at the time) was anything but scary !, and the last scene which the devil's son is standing between a man and a woman.. I've had a long time to understand that the man was the president of U.S.A with the first lady !! (I read it from a book by a great cinema critic from the U.K named Peter Nichols)Finally, it is a movie where evil is the conqueror at the end.. That is an important as well as rare thing in 1976, and as for me it is a very very rare to say "I love this" about a horror movie !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the opening scene and the first note of the Goldsmith theme, through to final climactic moment, this film is a satanic thrill ride. Between the nanny from hell, and the dark, foreboding priest, with outstanding performances by Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, David Warner, Billy Whitelaw, and Harvey Stephens this has to be one of the greatest horror shockers of all time. The scenes in the zoo brought me out of my seat, and the terrifying forewarnings of the photographs that Jennings takes prepares you but does not lessen the shock of the many deaths in the film. This is the scariest Omen of them all, although the sequels followed through well. To total volume of the three Goldsmith Scores achieve a frisson of evil that has never been matched.</fullReview>

This memorable horror film is followed by two sequels, a ridiculous T.V. sequel that never should have existed and an uninspired but somewhat effective remake. Sharply written by David Seltzer (Lucas, Punchline, Shining Through). Seltzer also wrote a familiar thriller titled "The 13th Angel". Panavision. (**** 1/2 out of *****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even if it won't be considered a classic in the future, THE OMEN is still a superior mystery thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: An effectively creepy thriller with convincing performances and memorably gruesome murders.I picked up the copy of "The Omen" when I was looking for a decent horror movie to watch. I didn't know much about the story when I bought it, all I know is that it was about a devil child and his plot to wreck havoc upon the Earth. I didn't expect much when I first saw it, I wouldn't even think I would understand the story. But when I finally watched it, I no doubt enjoyed it a lot. "The Omen" was such a great horror story, that I watched it countless times."The Omen" goes beyond the expected story. American ambassador of Britain (played excellently by Gregory Peck) adopts a seemingly simple child in order to replace the stillborn baby. Lee Remick gives a great performance as the unknowing wife Kathryn, Billie Whitelaw is eerie as the Thorns' governess. And David Warner is fine as the doomed Keith Jennings. Oh! And the performance by Patrick Troughton, as the damned Father Brennan, deserves some credit.But much of the credit goes to child star Harvey Stephens in the role of Damien, the adopted son of the Thorns', who is prophesied to be the Antichrist, the son of Satan. Stephens gives enough chills as Damien. Unlike the others who played Damien in the sequel and the kid who played him in the 2006 remake, Stephens looks more like a normal-looking boy, which makes it the more chilling and mysterious. On the other hand, the other Damiens look immediately like strange-looking boys, which makes it much easier to tell who's who.Other credits goes to Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar-winning score which really goes with the film's disturbing atmosphere, Gilbert Taylor's magnificent work behind camera and Richard Donner's superb direction.This suspenseful horror tale really kicks. The sequels lack the kick of the original but still watchable. But still, the original is still the very best.A real classic. Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this i think is the best horror film ever made the actual horror of having your child replaced with the spawn of the devil as all parents do when their child throws a tantrum and refuses to go to school then we all sympathise with Gregory peck but as i say this will always be my favourite horror of all time as being quite old i was able to see not once but a few times in the cinema and i do not think any remake would come close because the cast i think was first class and cannot be surpassed. Furthermore i think that the scene with when Billie Whitelaw attacked him in the kitchen was the best horror scene ever staged an the use of the dogs was superb especially the scene in the graveyard which is infamous</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick Horror Flick! (Please Avoid The Awful 2006 Remake)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite horror movies, and with good reasons. The acting is top-notch, the character development is an excellent blend of dramatic suspense and shock, while at the same time, offering very little blood or gore. The Omen is a movie that makes you think and maintains interest throughout.Credit must be given to many masters of acting in this movie. Gregory Peck and Lee Remick are wonderful as the parents of satanic child Damian, played to perfection by young Harvey Stevens. Billie Whitelaw is absolutely chilling as the sinister housekeeper who will stop at nothing to protect Damian.Cinematography is also very effective. This is because The Omen builds off of situational suspense and an excellent music score rather than going for a cheap bloody gross-out, which seems to be the main ingredient of most horror films today that are too long on effects but short on substance, The Omen has just the right amount of quality effects and suspense to make it a classic to remember for the ages.The only downfall (and it is mild) is that sometimes the actors talk very quietly and it isn't always easy to hear what they are saying. But the overall package of this film is excellent. Please do not waste your time or money with the God-awful remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brilliant score, tight direction, dead on performances, and a genius script keeps this horror thriller in the highest echelons in the history of cinema. Adapted from David Seltzer's novel, Richard Donner went first class with this timeless production. The pacing is breathless, and the suspense keeps viewers riveted through out. So many films have borrowed so much from this movie, it's almost absurd. One comment mentioned this as being SCHLOCK? Um - firstly, it's important to know what schlock means. Secondly, kind of important you know who um, Gregory peck is? Who Lee Remick is? Um, who Jerry Goldsmith is? This film still holds up - dim the lights and lock the doors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will never forget this film. I will never forget how Mrs. Baylock pushes Katherine Thorn through the window. I will never forget the photographer's horrifying death, and I will never forget Damien Thorn's malevolent face.This film is really scary, dark, sinister and, of course, unforgettable. All the actors are brilliant. Gregory Peck and Lee Remick as Robert and Katherine Thorn.Harvey Stephens as the profligate Damien and Billie Whitelaw as evil Mrs. Baylock.Robert Thorn is going to visit her wife Katherine to the hospital, because she's giving birth. But the baby is born dead. Katherine doesn't knows it, so a priest proposes Robert to change the baby who was born at the same time and whose mother died in the childbirth; Thorn accepts and, five years later, the boy, Damien, begins to behave strangely and soon his parents discover that he is the Antichrist.This is sincerely a wonderful and unforgettable film that will never get me bored. A classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie deals with the subject of the devil returning to earth for end of days. It covers the Birth of Damien, who wears the mark of the beast (666) as a birthmark hidden in his scalp. Currently (in 2011), the movie is rated #66 among horror movies of all time! Still creepy after all these years ...I saw this movie when I was about 18 years old, and quite frankly, i did not sleep very well for 3 or 4 days afterwards. Since I'm 44 years old now, I cannot give a good description of the movie, however, the only difference between the leading character, Damien, and other historic 'devils' such as Hitler or Stalin, doing in their enemies was a lot more difficult and bureaucratic, but the results were basically the same.be prepared for some pretty gory and unsightly deaths for some of the characters who oppose Damien ...As a horror film, this movie is only eclipsed by "Halloween" - since that movie was 100% believable as something that could easily happen in real life ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the creepiest horror movies out there.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen tells the story of a politician and his wife, who gives birth to a stillborn child. In an effort to cover it up, he adopts a child named Damien whose mother has died and gives it to his wife. Unfortunately, the child he adopted is the Antichrist. When his adopted son turns five, strange things begin to happen, and people connected to Damien begin to die. Soon, the politician teams up with a photographer to uncover the truth and put an end to the satanic killing. The Omen is a very creepy film that still chills me every time I watch it because of its creepy plot and chilling score.From the very beginning of the film you get chills, because in the opening credits you are treated to a Satanic score that sets the total tone for the film. Then you see the date at the bottom of the screen during the opening scene, June 6th, 6 am. That let's you know right away what the movie is going to be all about. Through the first half of the film, it is a regular creepy horror film with freaky and cool deaths. The second half of the movie is like a mystery, and the scenes where the photographer and Thorne are putting together that Damien is indeed the son of the Devil still gives me goosebumps. And not only does this movie contain the coolest beheading of all time, but the very first in Hollywood as well. Right up until the last creepy second of the film, you'll be on the edge of your seat.As for acting, I enjoyed all of the performances except for Gregory Peck, who is very wooden in some scenes, but I have to look past that because of how great the rest of the movie is. This is truly one of the best psychological horror films around.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard about this film for ages, and when I heard of "The Omen" remake that is being released June 6, 2006, it inspired me to go get over with it and rent the original film, before I see the remake."The Omen" is about an ambassador, Robert and his wife, Katharine Thorn, a wealthy couple in London. Katharine gives birth to a stillborn, and Robert, who can't tell her the devastating news, adopts an orphan infant to replace the baby, hoping Katharine will never know of her miscarriage. They name the boy Damian, and on his 5th birthday, his nanny commits suicide by hanging herself off of the house in front of the entire party. As Robert is contacted by a Roman Catholic priest, strange events begin to take place, including more mysterious deaths and a strange replacement nanny who seems a little odd. Robert then teams up with a reporter who is also experiencing strange phenomenon, and they both must then uncover the mystery behind Damian's origins, for they believe that little Damian may be the Anti-Christ himself.I found this to actually better than "The Exorcist", it was better-told and more believable in my opinion. "The Exorcist" was far too corny, but I found this to be much more realistic. This film was genuinely creepy, and had some great moments throughout. Gregory Peck and Lee Remick both gave excellent performances, and little Damian was one creepy little kid. The story was excellent, and pretty scary. I'm looking forward to the remake of this, but I'm not sure if it can quite live up to this original. We'll see. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Omen. I have seen this whole movie on TV one weekend and expected it to be a non-scary outdated horror movie. i guess I was wrong. The story itself is basically about the anti-Christ and his birth. This film had an awesome cast, including Gregory Peck. I didn't really expect him to be in such a scary film.The movie's entire mood is dark and the oldness of the movie actually helps. No, it is not cheesy like all the other horror movies out in the theaters these days. Rather than showing disgusting images and chase scenes of one monster like all the modern horror movies, this one leaves you disturbed and terrified at the most. I felt so disturbed by this movie, I couldn't sleep for a day. The plot of this movie and the horrid idea that Peck's son is indeed anti-Christ himself just leaves you gripping and horrified. The clues and the disturbing presence just builds up and supernatural occurrences just scare the hell out of you. I felt goosebumps watching this movie. This movie indeed tops as the scariest movie I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thirty years later, it's still creepy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1968, an innocent woman gave birth to the Antichrist (Rosemary's Baby). In 1973, Satan himself took control of a teenage girl, scaring people witless for ages (The Exorcist). In 1976, his son came back, this time under the appearance of a five-year old boy...Thirty years on, The Omen remains one of the best horror films of all time. I saw it for the first time a few days ago, and I had trouble falling asleep the following night. Like in Halloween, there's almost no gore at all, but that doesn't weaken its ability to shock. If you want real horror but can't stand blood, The Omen is perfect.The movie begins in Rome, where American diplomat Robert Thorne (Gregory Peck) is told his son died just after birth. Since his wife (Lee Remick) doesn't know about it, he accepts father Spiletto's offer: to take care of an orphan and raise him as his own child. Five years pass, and Damien (Harvey Stephens) seems to have a great time living in London with the Thornes. If it weren't for that priest, Father Brennan (Patrick Troughton) who starts telling Robert the kid must die. And that inexplicable suicide at the birthday party. And that photographer, with whom Robert begins to realize the truth: what if sweet little Damien was actually the (literal) Antichrist?The Omen's power doesn't lie in the atrocious deaths or other "typical" shock factors. It's the subject itself that's unsettling. Consider the scene where Thorne (brilliantly played by Peck) starts having doubts about his son: should he kill him or not? That's a thought which is supposed never to even be joked about. It's the prospect of murdering a child that upsets the most, or at least that's what happened to me (I actually felt sorry for Damien, even though I knew I was making a mistake). And the whole thing is made more chilling by Jerry Goldsmith, whose score is arguably the best (read: scariest) horror soundtrack ever, bar John Carpenter's Halloween theme. Those tunes, alongside the last shot in the film (trust, you'll have a hard time forgetting that one) make The Omen unmissable for those who love the genre. Rosemary's Baby aside, it's the best film ever made about the Antichrist. That Harvey Stephens really scared me...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best horror movie I have ever seen, no doubt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am only 16 years old. In my life I haven't seen so much horror movies, but this one "The Omen", was discovered by a friend of mine. He saw the movie, and immediately told us it is an excellent movie. We came to see the movie without many expectations, but we were so wrong. The movie starts very good, it tells us precisely the facts about the father and the mother. Robert Thorn, an American ambassador who wants a child more than anything. His true child dies on birth, and he takes another kid instead of his true kid. Later, we understand that, this thing he has just done, will be the worst mistake in his life.The whole movie is thrilling, exciting, the acting is perfect, and the movie itself doesn't frightens like "Friday the 13th" for example, but it is more interesting and the acting is just wonderful. The end in "The Omen" is one of the fantastical ends I have ever seen and will see. The sudden thing that happened just made me scream so hard, I did not think the movie would end like this, but finally I realized that this is the best end of all. The second movie of the series "Damien: Omen II" is crap. Boring, not good acting, not scary, not recommended at all.The 3rd movie "The Final Conflict" is for me, a great movie. The way the Damien manages the things in the movie is good, and the 3rd movie is really good in my opinion.The 1st movie, "The Omen" is the best horror film I have ever seen, and it is recommended for every horror film fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Omen' is a popular horror film about a little boy who is Satan. Freak accidents keep happening to people surrounding this little boy, and everyone who may harm the boy are killed in some creative manner. This film is pretty good at portraying the horror associated with this little innocent-looking boy. The suspense is also played up through a good story and imagery and music, and the film has plenty of memorable moments. Most of the success of this film plays on creating the suspense and then letting the viewer use his or her imagination. It's also the best film in the genre, and the other 'Omen' films do not even come close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scaring The Hell Into You...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the stratospheric success of THE EXORCIST at the box office, it was only a matter of time before Hollywood got a case of the Imitation Blues, and everybody started cranking out pictures about Mr. Scratch, a.k.a. The Evil One, Lucifer, Satan, etc. Leave it to two television vets - writer David Seltzer and director Richard Donner - to come up with the best of the lot.Like its pea-soup stained predecessor, THE OMEN has become so ingrained into the lexicon of pop culture, that it's almost inconceivable for someone not to know anything about it. But just in case you don't: Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) and his beautiful wife Kathy (Lee Remick) have always wanted a child, but have had a previously unsuccessful attempt at conception. Anguished by the latest miscarriage, Robert is desperate to go to any lengths to avoid the complete emotional destruction of his beloved spouse by this latest tragedy. When someone makes him an offer that is outlandish yet irresistible, and that someone is a priest, Robert in his desperation decides to make a deal with the devil. Literally.And what he and Kathy thought was a healthy, bouncing baby boy, turns out to be the human manifestation of The Anti-Christ. Which becomes more apparent as warnings, signs and some pretty spectacular deaths pile up around the Thorn family, as those invested in the rise of the Devil's son to power will stop at nothing to ensure that the prophecy is fulfilled at any cost.Gee, and Rosemary Woodehouse thought SHE had problems! Basically, you've got your B-movie plot line with a lot of pseudo-religious hoo-ha mixed in, and the results could've been laughable. But the main three points that give this movie the gravitas and believability that make it so frightening, are the straight-faced, no-nonsense performances of Peck and Remick, and Jerry Goldsmith's ominous, Oscar-winning score.Because the leads are so strong in their roles, every single cast member follows suit, and the result is one goosebump-raising time at the movies. What could've seemed like rank overacting suddenly becomes very engaging and terrifying, with special kudos to David Warner, Billie Whitelaw, Patrick Troughton, little Harvey Stephens, of course, (who evokes chilling memories of a certain little Miss McCormack) and a terrific yet uncredited Leo McKern (the BBC's RUMPOLE OF THE BAILEY) as demon hunter Bugenhagen.Donner, with ample help from cinematographer Gil Taylor, invests nearly the entire film with an impending sense of dread and doom, especially as the forces of good battle against seemingly insurmountable odds to tackle their Satanic opponents. But add Goldsmith's malevolently majestic soundtrack, and it clinches the deal for the nightmares that so many people had well after this movie had stretched into three (!!!) more sequels. There were folks I spoke to who were more terrified of this film than THE EXORCIST and ROSEMARY'S BABY put together.By investing in a solid cast, a tightly constructed script and doing whatever it took to make a limited budget look like a mega-blockbuster on screen, Donner and Company took what could have been a camp-fest and turned it into a creepy classic for the ages. SO classic, as a matter of fact, that now it has actually spawned a new (and probably unnecessary) remake.I don't envy the producers of the new version one little bit. Gentlemen, you have a big, red-hot pair of pointy shoes to fill....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For all the fans of suspenseful, but not gory horror movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with horror movies is that there are always two camps of fans. Those who prefer movies full of gore, zombies,... (for instance "The Evil Dead) and those who like horror movies full of suspense like for instance "The Others" and this one. Personally I'm not a fan of gore, but I certainly can appreciate this kind of horror movies.Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) is the American ambassador in Rome who's wife has a stillborn child. Because he can't tell her the awful news, he decides to adopt another child, whose mother died shortly after giving birth, and not to tell her the truth about her own son. The child who he adopts on recommendation of a priest, was born on the 6th of June at 6 o'clock in the morning (so at 6 on 6/6). Five years later the Thorns have moved to London, where they live as a happy family. Because of Damien's fifth birthday, they have organized a big reception and everything goes smoothly until his nanny throws herself of the roof with a rope around her neck. She's killed instantly in front of the eyes of the guests. But this isn't just a coincidence, many more people will follow her in death and all have something to do with Damien in one way or another. The child appears to be the son of Satan...As I already said, I'm a fan of horror movies that are full of suspense and this movie has plenty of it to offer. This entire movie is full of tension and thrills and offers exactly what I hoped for. And even though this movie is already about 30 years old, it still hasn't lost any of its power. Perhaps the main reason why this is, is because of the actor's performances. They all did a good job, but it is the little Harvey Stephens as Damien who steals the show. That little boy was just incredible. I really loved him in his role of Damien, the son of Satan. If you are a fan of horror movies that aren't full of gore, than I suggest you give this one a try. Don't mind about its age, it's a good movie and I reward it with at least a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is actually one that still scares me. The idea of the unknown, Hell, and The AntiChrist is brought to life here perfectly. The movie is original and at times, painfully sad and gruesomely violent.The acting is great. Gregory Peck is convincing as Thorn. Lee Remick is good as the frightened Mrs. Thorn. Billie Whitelaw is fantastic as the crazy, psychotic, devil-worshipping Mrs. Baylock. Even Damien himself is unsettling. But the best performance comes from David Warner who, as Keith Jennings, is fantastic.The deaths in the movie are very creative. They are similar to the deaths in Final Destination, but three times as effective. A hanging, an impaling, a decapitation, etc. While these are not in any way bloody or gory, they are still immensely shocking and very frightening.How everything was deciphered from the Book of Revelation into modern day context was very clever. Saying how the devil will rise in the "sea of humanity" (I'm not sure if that's entirely correct) was equivalent to Damien coming to power in the world of politics only made everything seem more realistic. Absolutely excellent.The ending is perfect and I'm glad it leaves you feeling uneasy. If you watch this, watch it at night in complete darkness. I guarantee you will be creeped out.</fullReview>

I don't think that he was ever really aware of who or what he really was. This movie grips you into it's world and makes you think about the characters involved and helps you to follow into the story.

Without relying on lavish special effects or a giant budget, The Omen still manages to be one of the scariest and intense horror films of its era. Personally I enjoyed this film more than I did The Exorcist, but that's just me. Still, I would recommend The Omen to anyone that enjoys a truly scary and thought provoking horror film.

		<shortDescription>An intelligent, thought-provoking horror/thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE OMEN (1976)THE GOOD:--I was genuinely intrigued by the story. The story of the devil child only got more interesting as it unravelled and the circumstances were explained to the audience. Although I am an atheist, I enjoyed the Christian elements in the story and found them to be entertaining and thought provoking.--That this a child and not the full-on devil (ALA "End of Days") makes the story more intriguing as Gregory Peck's character must wrestle with the wrongs of killing a child and the rights of offing Satan's spouse.--The direction was so good that the audience could be creeped out with a simple stare or gesture. --I appreciated that the film was both a psychological thriller and a heart-pumping horror, and that it takes time to develop these different genres and balance them out. The story in itself made for a horrifying psychological thriller and some of the neat deaths (it's all about the death-by-decapitation scene, one of my favourite death scenes in a film) qualified the film into the horror genre.THE BAD:--The movie does drag at times and takes too much time with some plot points that could've been cut down a lot, for instance the stuff in Jerusalem and the monks.--Though I loved his performance in "To Kill a Mockingbird", Gregory Peck's performance here is quite the opposite of that. In that fabulous 1962 film he was humane, subtle and quietly slipped into character, but here he forces his lines and it sounds very over-the-top. He isn't a complete disaster but I expect more from this great actor.RATING:8/10 - Though not quite up there with the similarly themed "The Exorcist", "The Omen" holds it own as a scary, intelligent horror/thriller.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND:Candyman (6/10) Carrie (9/10) End of Days (6/10) The Exorcist (9/10) Stigmata (6/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this a film that can stand the test of time? Well, that was my big question after having experienced it with frightened eyes as a kid I was glad to see it back and perhaps it wasn't the kind of movie that freaked me to death men can say it was perhaps one of the motherfilms of all the usual horrorsages that would be thrown at us years later and what is more, this movie has great cinematographic stands (just rewatch the scene at where Gregory Peck meets the priest near the Thames). The story of the movie is a classic : a British ambassador has to choose between telling his wife that she just gave birth to a dead son or just exchanging it with an other lost baby who is given by a nun...the rest is history as they say : they adopted Damien, the child with 666 as birthmark... In some ways you can say "The omen" is the cheaper version of "The exorcist" (even if it are two different movies) but it's definitely worth seeing and some scenes belong to the immortal history of horrorsuspense. As usual some sequels (two I think) were made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In between the age of the B-movie and the era of the teen-slasher, horror films had a brief golden age in the early to mid 70s. The success of the best pictures of this time was there understanding that the genre is fundamentally about fear and madness, not about monsters, although there must be something beneath the surface too, to put the audience on edge. My own favourite is 'Don't Look Now', but 'The Omen' is genuinely chilling, with an excellent performance from Gregory Peck as the man who adopts the devil for a son. Less pretentious, and overheated, than 'The Exorcist', the film's strength lies in its relative restraint. The surprise ending is good, as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A largely impressive horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist laid the formula for horror movies featuring deadly children, and The Omen goes down a similar route. This commercial blockbuster from 1976 remains one of the most successful and popular horror movies ever made, despite the fact that script writer David Seltzer felt it was a worthless work ("I did it strictly for the money" was his verdict on the film). Gregory Peck plays the US Ambassador in Rome. At the start of the film, he arrives at an Italian hospital to discover that his wife has just lost her baby during child-birth. Unable to think of a way to break the tragic news to her, a priest offers him a chance to dodge the issue. Another baby has been born that same night, only for its mother to die in labour. If Peck were to adopt that baby, and tell his wife that it's her's, everyone would be happy. Right? Not if you've just adopted the Anti-Christ, which is what Peck gradually comes to learn (but not until much death and destruction has elapsed). There's something fundamentally sick about a film in which a young boy kills people. However, the tastelessness of The Omen is skillfully disguised. Seltzer is wrong to criticise his script, as it contains some excellent dialogue and powerful shock scenes, including filmdom's most memorable decapitation scene. Peck gives his most enjoyable performance in a decade as the loving father who realises too late that he is nurturing a monster. The difficult task of incorporating biblical prophecies into a modern day chiller is effectively handled, with David Warner doing a particularly noteworthy job of delivering the lines which tie all the loose ends together. On the whole, The Omen is a well crafted and entertaining bloodcurdler.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One day closer to the end of the world...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I was only a kid when The Omen was released, I can still remember those creepy, gothic-looking posters the distributors plastered everywhere, bearing cheery slogans along the lines of "Today is one day closer to the end of the world". This film was launched with one of the most effective ad campaigns in cinema history, and the publicity blitz served its purpose brilliantly. Unfortunately, the hype (along with the Medved brothers and their endless series of turkey-bashing books) has rather obscured the fact that The Omen is actually a very good film.David Seltzer's much-criticized screenplay is one of the film's strongest assets - the plotting, dialogue and pacing are stripped down to their bare bones, with barely an ounce of waffle or tedium, and the shocks are as strong today as they were nearly thirty years ago. Richard Donner's direction is tight and quietly impressive, whilst Gilbert Taylor's gloomy photography and washed-out colours create an atmosphere of impending doom without recourse to the bells and whistles beloved of modern horror directors. The performances are all fine (but why is Leo McKern absent from the credits?) and the special effects - especially the intricately-staged decapitation - knock spots off any amount of computer-generated rubbish you might care to parade before me. (Having said that, the scene in the graveyard where Gregory Peck and David Warner discover the truth about Damien's heritage is a little too obviously a studio set.) Another honourable mention must go to the score, often wrongly believed to be Karl Orff's 'Carmina Burana'(ie the music from the Old Spice aftershave commercials), but actually the work of Jerry Goldsmith.Ignore the numerous spoofs and the rotten sequels and enjoy The Omen for what it is - a spooky, engaging and completely humourless tale from the heart of darkness itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Donner is one of the most diverse directors I have ever seen. While he seems to have his head stuck in many veins of comedy (Maverick, the Lethal Weapon movies, Scrooged), he can't resist the various changes in gear. I will excuse the ultra-ridiculous Superman movies from my comment altogether.The Omen is Donner's only mainstream horror attempt and I must say I am surely surprised by his lack of a television influence. Donner worked on the Twilight Zone and I think he took a few cues from Rod Serling as towards pacing and what to (not) reveal to the audience. While Omen is conservative enough by today's standards, it is superior to both The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby because Donner understands the audience better than Friedkin and Polanski.Gregory Peck has never been diverse in his acting appearance, certainly by comparison to someone like Nicolas Cage. He is wooden, I will admit that, but there is an air of authority that rubs off in many of his roles whether it's Captain Ahab, Lt. Clemens, or Atticus Finch. Here his stoicism doesn't help because a character in his position needs to be flexible. Donner understands this shortcoming and more than makes up for it with his interaction of the various characters.Of course, the real highlight is not visible. Jerry Goldsmith provides some of the best pompous horror music ever created that exceeds what John Carpentar has composed. It is so vibrant, and more than a little spooky, that the film itself cannot hold a candle to the power he unleashes with his notes.Donner's camera is very loose for a 70s movie, that was a bit of a surprise. He isn't interested in "money shots", just creating a mood. David Warner complements that mood as the quirky photographer who never learned basic do's and don'ts of automobile safety. See it, you'll understand.Unfortunately, the basic story is what takes the worst fall. Many of the elements, the priest in particular, are mere parodies and the numerous sequels and spin-offs of the story have given rise to the cockamamie "anti-Christ" genre that is deader than Madeline Murray O'Hare. (brief spoiler) While I knew that Peck would never complete his mission--who would ceremonially slaughter a child in a movie like this?--I was rather surprised as to how he failed. The epilogue alone flaunts Donner's directorial skills.Overall, a slightly better-than-average horror movie to pass the time. While it is aged, the movie is not about shocks (although there are quite a few) and defines the genre. End of debate. Donner's work is never deep, but he knows the audience and has a much better knowledge of the film process than someone like Michael Bay. We'll see how his rendition of Timeline comes out, certain to be a misfire. 3 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some bits are silly, some good, and some downright brilliant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to rent this after the (sob) death of Gregory Peck. First, I viewed the trailer on the DVD and even that was kind of funny. Direct quote: "American Ambassador Robert Thorn and his wife Katharine are very happy about the birth of their son, Damien." My brother and I cracked up at that. Amazing, how much a few movies can affect people's association with Satan. Okay, that aside, here's the gist:Robert Thorn (the amazingly talented and handsome Gregory Peck) is an American ambassador who lives in Rome with his wife Kathy (the amazingly talented and beautiful Lee Remick). He learns, before she, that their new and first child is stillborn. Robert goes to a church where some nuns show him a live baby that was also born at that time (June 6th at 6 AM, by the way), and offers him to Robert, as he could pass as their son. This puts Robert in the lose-lose situation of either telling Kathy the baby she had is dead or lying to her and saying that this baby is theirs. You can probably guess which one he chooses, since it's a matter of whether or not this movie would have been made. Anyway, they take home the cute little devil named Damien, and soon they have to move to London. Now, before I describe the first silly (supposed to be creepy) part, I'll explain that I understand Kathy and Robert are very much in love. I mean, she's absolutely gorgeous, and he's Gregory Peck, for crying out loud, but that's no excuse to be so fascinated with each other as they go for a walk that they briefly lose sight of Damien, now a toddler. And then after that there's a hanging scene (not gory, just kind of spooky), a scene where a spear stabs through an important someone (not gory or spooky; you can see it coming a mile away), two scenes where the same person falls from a high point (painful to watch, but that's good), an attack in a graveyard by about ten rottweilers (pretty bloody and subsequently followed by a sharp peak on a fence stabbing through someone's arm), and a REALLY AWESOME decapitation scene (a little blood). I normally hate gore, but c'mon, you have to praise the sfx people of 1976 to do that scene so well. Basically, Robert learns that Damien is the son of Satan. Now, although the first third of the film is unintentionally silly and sometimes over-acted, the rest is quite good, with some bits shot quite brilliantly. For instance, anyone who's seen a single Peck film has to know that he can save a movie most of the time. Anyway, Peck is brilliant as usual, as is Remick. The kid was SOOOO adorable, but did have a little devilishness about him. Billie Whitelaw (the creepy nanny) had me hating her from the second she walked into their house, especially after what she does later on (more about that later). And the score scared the hell out of me (no pun intended). When Peck walks into his house for the last time and we hear a mixture of the dog panting and a choir whispering and chanting "Ave Satani," I had goosebumps. Some of the little bits I loved and/or that scared me (some spoilers): Robert's frustration that he has to stab Damien, when he and the photographer unearth the skeletons of both Damien's mother and Robert's real son with a hole in its skull, and Kathy's blue eyes widening under that veil-like cover-up as she sees the creepy nanny approaching with that sick smile (even though it was an awful part, I have to say that was when Remick looked the most beautiful, almost like an angel, therefore the nanny had to kill her). Also (BIG SPOILER), I felt Robert's pain when he was about to stab Damien as he said, "No, Daddy, no." And you have to love Damien's smile at the end....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coming Of The Antichrist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following on the heels of such films as ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN became one of the most commercially and artistically successful horror movies of all times. Even today, after myriads of imitators and increasingly outrageous sequels, it stands as a masterful Satanic thriller.Under the excellent direction of Richard Donner, who later made SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE and the LETHAL WEAPON films, THE OMEN boasts a chilling storyline about the much-feared coming of the Antichrist, or Devil's Child. That child is Damien, who has unwittingly been adapted by the U.S. ambassador (Gregory Peck) to England and his wife (Lee Remick). When horrible things start happening, a priest (Patrick Troughton) tries to give Peck a warning about the child, a warning he disbelieves. Not long after that, the priest is impaled during a freak storm. Only after Remick ends up in the hospital in a suspicious accident at home engineered by Damien's nanny (Billie Whitelaw) does Peck start to investigate. Along with a sympathetic journalist (David Warner), he makes inquiries to the priests and the nurses who engineered the adoption and comes to realize that Damien is, in fact, the Son of the Devil with a birthmark of "666"--the Mark of the Beast--on his scalp.But even when told by a priest (Leo McKern) is Israel that the killing must be done on hallowed ground, he refuses vehemently. Only after Warner is gruesomely decapitated does he go back to London for the ultimate confrontation between Good and Evil that could spell the end of the world.Despite a slight hectoring tone in its recitation of Biblical prophecies, David Seltzer's screenplay for THE OMEN is a benchmark of narrative invention, something that sets it apart from a lot of horror films, even THE EXORCIST. The film is propelled by the actions of the characters and the excellent Oscar-winning orchestral/choral score by Jerry Goldsmith. And with the one spectacular exception of the decapitation scene, the film's best-remembered set piece and still one of the most gruesome of its type, THE OMEN doesn't rely on gory special effects. Peck, Remick, and Warner are extremely good and professional in their roles, and Whitelaw makes for a disturbing nanny. Harvey Stephens plays Damien quite well...frighteningly well.Like THE EXORCIST and ROSEMARY'S BABY, THE OMEN was the subject of a great deal of controversy in religious circles, something that only helped to boost its box office; it eventually grossed $50 million, a not inconsiderable sum for 1976. Horror film fans must get their hands on this movie, though children under seventeen must not be allowed to see the film unsupervised; it is rightly rated 'R' for explicit adult content and sometimes graphic violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always say that if you're still thinking about a movie hours, or even days after seeing it and the effect still hasn't worn off, no matter how bad it was, it is a respectable movie. Any movie that can make you feel so strongly and give you such emotions for longer than its running time did a good job. When watching The Omen, I can't say I was very interested in what was going on. For the most part, I was bored. But as I began to dig into the themes playing in the movie, that's when I began to feel afraid. Not of what was on the screen, I could handle that, but of the unknown. The fear that maybe, just maybe, this movie is more real than you think. I have never been very religious, but the only religion I have known is Christianity. Therefore, thinking about the coming of the anti-christ and the countdown to armageddon filled me with the impending doom that maybe in my lifetime, this could really happen. But it's unlikely. This movie is chilling for what it's about, not because of what it does. Some of it is hokey, and feels hammed up and cheesy. A lot of biblical babble. The music is great, though, and so is the acting. Some scenes were pretty memorable, the decapitation to be exact. But unless you are willing to think and dig beneath the surface of this movie, you probably will be bored. For the actual movie itself, I would give it *** stars out of *****. Not bad. But for what the movie gives to the viewer as a result of watching, I give ***** stars out of *****. This movie will get under your skin, no matter what religion you follow. It's like it gives you a gift you don't really want, the thought that maybe, somewhere out there, these events are already under way. This is psychological horror better than it has ever been. This film is not scary unless you think. From the mysterious accidents, the haunting score, the impending doom, and the tragic fate that befalls the Thorn family, this movie will reach you on levels you never thought a horror picture could. It is very well made. This movie will make you think long after it is over. You may even have nightmares. It is all the more frightening when you consider the "curse" the film has hanging over it during production. Just like in The Exorcist. Very creepy. One of the most mature, and well crafted horror tales of our time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Omen is a psychological thriller rather horror, this is the film that made Donner! You know the story, it's very simple, some people think it's absurd, and would've been a total disaster if the cast didn't believe in it. The film does have plot holes, but it works because the film is grounded in reality, using the Bible as a source of information, which could be true!The film doesn't rely on gore, but threat, there's a unique atomosphere to the entire picture.Gregory Peck adds verisimilitude to the picture, you believe what's happening because Peck is in the picture. Lee Remick is very good, too, she adds a lot to the film. David Warner is brilliant, as is Billie Whitelaw, who adds a certain unique uneasiness to the proceedings! The kid is also very good, especially in the finale!The direction is excellent, Donner makes good use of the panavision frame, make no mistake, this is a film which can be only seen in wide-screen!The score is superb, the use of the chorus is chilling! Goldsmith won the oscar, he deserved it.This is a film you want to watch on your own because it does scare you, especially if it's your first time!Omen 2 came next!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Terrific Horror Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen is one of my favorite films of all time. You cannot have a better cast than Lee Remick, Gregory Peck, Billie Whitelaw CBE in her best role as the hellish nanny, and David Warner. Harvey Stephens gives a terrifying performance as the young boy, Damien. IT's worth viewing, it's a must see for anybody who believes in the paranormal like myself. Although the story behind the film offers quite a fascinating look at the possibility that it may have been cursed in the first. You know the saying that art replicates life. Now that they have remade it with Liev Schrieber and Julia Stiles for the 30th anniversary of the first film, nothing comes close or better to the original. It's still one of my favorite horror films of all time. They replaced Whitelaw's Mrs. Baylock with Mia Farrow which is kind of a genius casting call since she was Rosemary in Rosemary's Baby, another classic thriller. The original beats any remake because the cast is just excellent, Lee Remick and Gregory Peck are truly believable as an older couple in love and wanting a family. Harvey Stephens is just perfect as Damien. And of course, the other cast members, the wonder Billie Whitelaw best known for her performances in Samuel Beckett plays, David Warner as the photographer, and Rumpole's own Leo McKern as the archaeologist in Israel. I just wished that I saw what the original mother looked like even toward the end of the film.</fullReview>

Richard Donner's direction is very self-confident with hardly any flaws, and the film is visually quite appealing.As a pure shocker, it's a tremendously effective product--mostly thanks to Jerry Goldsmith's irreplaceable background score.

The Omen is most memorable for 3 things in my opinion. 1. the death scene very frightening. they are filmed so so well that they make you jump even if you know they are going to happen. 2.The casting of the child that played Damien.

		<fullReview>There seem to be two distinct camps where this film is concerned. Those who believe it to be a classic horror movie, and those who consider it to be a load of cobblers. Then there's the subdivision of people who say that one needs to be religious in order to get the best experience of the film. I think the exact opposite is true. One needs to have a mind completely free of the religious cancer in order to truly appreciate this film.After all, why is it that the Christian-run United States Of America feels the need to build up arsenals against all sorts of imagined enemies? Now they seem to want to rope other, more enlightened civilisations such as England into building a networked SDI. The last time America had a Christian president who was in favour of SDI, it went from the world's largest creditor to the world's largest debtor. Facts like this are important to keep in mind when watching The Omen, as they allow the viewer to understand the kind of market that allowed it to achieve the thousand-odd percent return it got.[These next paragraphs might spoil the film if you haven't seen it before, so be warned.]The film is basically about a conspiracy of Satanists who con a powerful political figure into adopting a child who was born of a jackal, after murdering his true son. That's really all there is to it, unless you count the numerous incidental death scenes that accompany this politician's attempts to discover the truth. What makes this premise rather laughable is the number of times I have been harassed in the streets of my home city by Christian bible-pushers who seem to only take fists for an answer. I have not ever been harassed by Satanists who meet this description, so the idea that they lurk around every corner, waiting to do some harm to some poor Christian man and his family has me in laughter every time I watch this film.Patrick Troughton practically steals the show in the limited screen time that he has. Like his predecessor on the Doctor Who series, he makes me wonder what sort of performance element he could bring to modern films. David Warner also steals the show once his character becomes more of a fixture in the story, by giving a scientific sort of feel to something that is really based on the writings of people who were obviously insane (I of all people should know). It is these actors and their performances that save the film from becoming an Ed Wood-style write-off. Come to think of it, I would have liked to have seen what he'd do with an idea like this one.All in all, I'd give The Omen seven points. Evenly divided between Patrick Troughton and David Warner for their performances. Nothing else in the film is really worthy of mention except the decapitation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who remembers early eighties television series "Jigsaw"? Truly a children's programme of disturbing content. There was co-presenter Adrian who never spoke ? was he telepathic, or a Michael Myers-style psychopathic killer? There was a yellow-headed man, years before The Simpsons, with a large nose and an evil stare. A real Hieronymus Bosch monstrosity, he used to give me nightmares for years. But perhaps most terrifying of all were the dwarf and the Scotsman (David Rappaport and Sylvester McCoy) who used to appear dressed as superheroes whenever anyone used to say a succession of eight words with a "double o" in the middle. They were the "O Men", and they were, to young minds, unsettling. Conversely, The Omen, while a finely made film, lacks this one vital spark ? the ability to scare or unnerve.Despite what you may have heard, it's a surprise to find that the film's basis, Damien, doesn't actually appear that much at all, perhaps just around fifteen minutes in total. This takes away the need for a strong child actor, and tells the story through the eyes of the adults. Central character then is Gregory Peck, who brings a strong performance to the role of ineffectual Ambassador who has little control over the events around him. He's backed up by a superb cast all the way, especially notable for the triumvirate of Billie Whitelaw (who played a similar character, if diametrically opposed, in The Water Babies), Patrick Troughton and Leo McKern.The crafting of the story, and the direction, is virtually faultless. Indeed, it's hard to believe that the director of this one went on to make mainstream, though still notable, films such as the first Superman and the quartet of Lethal Weapon movies. So successful was the movie (Over a $100 million profit from $8.8 million budget - including $6 million on the publicity campaign) that two reasonable sequels were released within five years. The second in particular was an adequate view, with more than a passing debt to Hitchcock and a genuinely surprising twist. We really don't have to mention the TV movie Omen IV here do we? Yet what all three films have in common is that the central character of Damien just isn't that scary as portrayed. Indeed, he doesn't even acknowledge his own nature until it's pointed out to him in the second, so the rather podgy little boy fails to generate fear. When he knocks his mother over a stair rail, it's less like the demonic work of the antichrist, more the clumsy-footed antics of a token fat kid. Also defying the myth built around the series is the incidental music. While strong, and often over the top, it lacks a clear theme and does not, as spoofs would have it, feature a particular passage of music that was used to advertise aftershave.The film is excellently acted, well written and strongly directed. Almost outstanding on every level, it's just a shame it doesn't deliver on the one that matters most ? the ability to scare. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two ways to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the few movies that truly has two completely different but equally enjoyable ways to watch. (Off-hand, the only others I can think of are 'The Princess Bride,' serious romance vs. tongue-in-cheek fairy tale, and the original 'Evil Dead,' too-cheap horror vs. knowing horror spoof.) You can watch it alone, late at night, with all the lights off, and be genuinely too scared to sleep that night; or you can watch it one day with all your best movie pals and laugh your head off at the over-the-top acts of satanism, way-too-serious plotline and the idea that large, easily confused Rottweilers are the harbingers of impending doom. It's to this movie's credit that it manages to pull off an idea as hard to swallow as the literal birth of the Antichrist with a completely straight face, and still manages not to scream 'B-movie badness' with every line. Though almost every element of the movie on its own seems ridiculous (Gregory Peck as the father of the Antichrist!?), it all somehow comes together in a solid, above-average horror flick that everyone ought to see just to realize that it can be done-- that there is a decent, and very enjoyable, middle ground between your laugh-a-minute 'crawling horror' flop and the all-out grotesquerie of 'The Exorcist.'</fullReview>

Also features one of the best decaptions ever and features one memorable shock scene after another. Very, very scary. Followed by many sequels and big box office success. 9.5 out of 10.Also, Billie Whitelaw is very, very good and nearly steals the whole show as the child's caretaker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film That Withstands the Test of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Technically, in the horror genre, this film is the "thinking man's" thriller. The film rarely crosses the line into the more common shock elements for the sake of "shock" to scare the viewerA film that has with stood the test of time, and would still be "fresh" if released today. With the elements of moral dilemmas and the horrendous realizations/revelations, this film is quite multi-dimensional.This film is best viewed in it's entirety, on video or premium channels, rather then the chopped up version for commercial television.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a pity to say that but this is true. Not very scary (I've seen a lot more creepier flicks) with laughable special effects. However the cast is great and there are still some nifty sequences. I agree with some reviewers who consider "Omen" as a classic. This is a real genre builder. All sequels in comparison are rather lame. So this is simply a must-see for all of you horror-fans. I will give "Omen" 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want a film that gives you an ominous feel of evil watch The Omen. Richard Donner's imagery is blended with Jerry Goldsmith's score to create a film that creeps you out with atmosphere and the occasional shock. To actually think that there is a force out there that is pure evil will send shivers down your spine. Someone who will make you jump off a roof with a rope around your neck, or one who commands the very forces of nature and has no remorse toward anyone is a vision that many can not shake. The final image of Damien staring back at you is one that will linger in your dreams for days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biblical Horror !!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I generally like horror films which deal with psychological issues and other themes which relate to the general lives of people. Hence I am a huge admirer of The Shining, The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, Repulsion, The Babadook,etc. The Omen starts with the premise of Robert(Gregory Peck) completely heartbroken after hearing that his baby has died just after birth at the hospital. He thinks he can't inform his wife Kathy(Lee Remick) about this death. The head priest of the catholic hospital reveals that another baby was born at that very day whose mother died during birth. So Peck decides to introduce this stranger to his wife as their son without telling her the truth. Slowly it gets revealed that this baby who grows into the boy named Daniel may be the Antichrist.The problem I have with this movie is the fact that it is too preoccupied with religious symbolism and biblical consequences. The problem is that there is no theme to this movie except the biblical one. A similar movie could have been made with implicit themes about how the father could never accept the kid completely and all that is happening could be pigments of his prejudiced imagination like "We Need to Talk About Kevin". But that is not the case here. What you see is what you get in The Omen. It is still a reasonably engaging watch and I can understand how some scenes could have been scary to viewers in the 70s, but now they look like clichés. The acting by Gregory Peck and Lee Remick is good. But Billie Whitelaw as Mrs. Baylock is the most memorable and extremely scary.The film is competently directed. The soundtrack is fascinatingly disturbing and creepy.I would have liked it more had I not watched it in 2014 after being familiar with all the clichéd tropes. The lack of any relatable theme also didn't help. But The Omen is still a relatively entertaining film worth watching once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damien!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen 1976 is a classic example of scaring the jimmies off of someone, making their bones jump right out of their skin! This film creep-ed the hell out of me when I first watched it, I mean who isn't afraid of someone who they think is just innocent. Who thinks that a little boy is bound to be the one causing the deaths of innocent people? Well it's little five year old Damien Thorn! I won't go too much into this since everyone has had to see this. The film starts off with an ambassador's wife getting pregnant but she loses the child and is replaced with a new child. This new child starts showing different signs and later on (after been persuaded heaps), the ambassador, Robert Thorn believes his son is the anti-Christ.Really excellent story which really kicks "The Exorcist" right out the window. This story keeps you wondering what's happening, pandering on how it's all going to ravel up and what mysterious lie within that cute, innocent cherub Damien.I'm not giving any scenes or nothing away, nothing, GO and watch it if you haven't seen it.All I will say is that it's suspenseful, it keeps you on the edge like other old horror classics have and the score by Jerry GoldSmith is created beautifully in this film. First he builds up with emotion and some happiness, and that he goes deep making is booming and loud as hell! I also think the direction of this film was taken really well.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teaming up to take on The Devil, no less; a more than competent thriller about the gradual uncovering of something estranged and unpleasant, which works well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the more telling moments of Richard Donner's original The Omen unfolds nearer the end, much nearer the end, during which a composition of the lead character's face fills the screen as he lies down whilst on board an overnight flight to the territory of Palestine. The film changes its scenery, a much longer shot of the locale at which he was just travelling to and has now arrived at; but Donner cross-dissolves from our lead's face and into the establishing composition of an array of centuries old ruins lying there in the beating sun rather than merely cutting to it, a highlighting of how far along he's come in the Hellish quest of realisation that he's had to undertake and a reiterating of how everything, at least inside of his life or mind, has quite literally gone to near-wreckage. But that comes later on down the line; Donner's film about the impending doom of a situation should a more than apt-lead fail, and a somewhat exquisitely made piece which makes great use of its premise in order to unearth some genuinely exciting thrills, spills and shocks. It totals up into an exciting, what I like to refer to as a satanic thriller more-so a horror, which succeeds in involving us as much as we are when the above edit unfolds.Robert Thorn, played by Gregory Peck, is an American senator. The man is quite clearly in a state of distress when we first see him; his charging through the Italian streets of Rome, whilst sat in the back of a taxi, as a voice-over of what we perceive to be a recent telephone conversation telling us of how a baby has just died at birth, fills our ears and gets across an unnerving sense about proceedings from the off. Arriving at a nunnery-come-hospital, he sits outside in a waiting area ? the man cutting a distraught figure as we appear to glance down at him from the first floor through some banister bollards somewhat eerily resembling a child's point of view as they glance down at the ground floor from up on high. It is Thorn's child and wife of whom the voice previously spoke, and his arriving at the building sees him get there in the nick of time to make a drastic decision over whether to adopt a previously born child whose mother eerily died in tandem with that of the Thorn's own. Known to Robert, but not to his wife Katherine (Remik), whose grief and natural reactions to such a tragedy are denied, he agrees and makes the switch with those running the monastery - the Thorn's leaving with a newborn after all.That child is Damien (Stephens), someone of whom grows up in affluent and loving family conditions until he becomes a young boy of about five years old when all manner of sordid activity begins to happen. But again, that comes later ? much later. In the mean time, we get the sense that Robert is a guy with a fair old ability to get things done. His career within the field of politics sees him with a deal of charisma and carry a general sense of profundity; a man whom, by his wife's own admission, humorously or otherwise, could very well be one the "future presidents" of The United States. The Thorns move from Italy to England's capital city, London, upon Damien's "birth"; their wealthiness and this general sense of the family being better off in life than most others is here put across via the fact they are chauffeur driven around a series of London streets rife with other vehicles looking less than glamorous, and probably housing people of a less wealthy disposition, in comparison.Then comes the grief and the strife; a series of episodes highlighting how seemingly disturbed the boy is coming along and then passing by, in the process piling it onto us that trouble is afoot but done so through means subtly conveyed rather than bombardment: when a trip to an open plan zoo goes awry, we question as to whether the animals might just have genuinely been more aggressive that day. When he gets distressed at going to church, maybe he's just nervous or mildly autistic enough not to like large crowds at this early stage in life; perhaps, when a maid commits suicide in the manner she does, she was just suffering internally herself and loved the boy too much to be dismissed from her duties. One of the perks for Harvey Stephens, Damien's actor, is that the more downplayed his performance, the more effective he is; that is to say, the less he reacts to all of this terrible, awful and quite disturbing content the better ? the worse the actor, the more damn affecting the whole thing is.Thrown in for good measure is David Warner's photojournalist Keith Jennings, a man who, through the medium of photography (a relatively recent, in comparison, man-made invention which I'm sure Satan himself, whose existed from the dawn of time, didn't account on having his plans thwarted by) realises there are meanings behind certain blemishes in certain photographs he takes. There is method to these sequences; when one picture reveals Jennings to be as doomed as everyone that has preceded him, we sense the terror and the fear imbued within later scenes when Jennings puts himself on the front-line in the battle against evil which later makes itself known - such scenes build tension and draw on effect through the anticipation of the character's grizzly demise, a far cry from all the effect and all the 'substance' lumped onto that of what might pass as more recent horror fare when the mere presentation of the gory demises seemingly suffices. The film is a devilish mystery, a morbid detective thriller; a film able to etch out a general sense of unease just by having a photograph fill the frame ? it is a worthy piece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some may agree this film is a continuation to 1968's "Rosemary's Baby", since there the son of the devil is born, and here he grows up in the (wrong) family. I remember back when I was in my 12, I watched this with a friend in a Sunday morning. I remember how scared we were and how this film frightened us. I thought that seeing this now, after seeing lots of suspense films I would find this weak, but I still find it a little creepy. The scene that the dad was in Damien's room and began shaving his head has got to be one of the most suspenseful scenes in movies. The director dropped the background sound and we had no idea of what evil could happen.. Fortunately, nothing much really happened and we breath again only when the scene is over.The fact that it's a religious film makes me be less scared, since I'm an atheist and don't believe in these things. Still, the film is creepy enough to tense and entertain the spectator. An indeed classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My all time favorite horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen is a brilliantly made movie about the Antichrist coming to earth in the form of a little boy and his father trying to figure out the mystery behind his son. The film has a great cast of characters led by the always excellent Gregory Peck who plays Robert Thorn the adopted father of the Antichrist named Damien.At first Damien seems to be a normal boy, but by his fifth birthday strange things begin to happen to the people around him. It first happens when the nanny hangs herself at Damien's birthday party. This sets the stage for a new nanny, Mrs. Baylock(chillingly played by Billie Whitelaw) who has been sent to protect Damien. A priest tries to inform Mr. Thorn of his son's true identity but Robert doesn't believe him. But when Katherin Thorn(his wife played by Lee Remick) is injured and the priest suspiciously dies his suspicions begin to grow. He is approached by a photographer named Keith Jennings(played by David Warner) who has been studying the photos of the nanny and the priest before they died and has discovered that strange blurs in the photos predict how that person is going to die. Now Mr. Thron and Jennings travel to Italy where Damien was born to find out if his son really is the Devil's child.The Omen is a brilliant psychological thriller that has stood the test of time and is still just as scary now as it was back then. The soundtrack in particular is the scariest part of the movie and Jerry Goldsmith definitely deserved that Oscar. If you haven't seen The Omen(or if you were forced to watch the remake) then I would suggest you check it out. It's not a movie that everyone will love, but it is worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so excellent, it was the first that gave me goosebumps and made me sweat as well! The music is terrific throughout, and the editing and the closeups are perfect too. The most creepy about this film is that the little boy seems so cute and lovely, and seemingly there is nothing wrong about him. The dialogs are interesting and keep you on the edge of your seat. I really liked the idea of foretelling the deaths of characters by the means of photographs. The ending is quite bad, and the most annoying thing is that nobody has the faintest idea about the kid, because everyone is dead who knew who he really is. And that smile on Damien's face at the end as he looks us in the eye...and we DO know, that he is in fact the Antichrist...and everything goes on as it did...and you just want to stab him to death! But you cannot kill the Devil, 'cause it will be always around. This film grabbed me and never let go off me until the end. I only recommend it for those who have the nerves for it, but if you have, believe me, it will be well worth watching it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some kids aren't that cute...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a Mummy and a Daddy love each other very much, and they unfortunately have a baby who does not survive the birth, the Daddy shouldn't agree to take a newly orphaned baby without telling Mummy first.That's the first few minutes of The Omen, it opens in Rome and pretty much runs as described above. The father is Gregory Peck as Robert, a prominent politician (who has a great "I AM ACTING!" voice), and the mother is Lee Remick as Kathy. Faced with the choice of telling Kathy that the baby did not survive, or taking the opportunity handed when another mother dies during her own son's birth, Robert takes the latter way out.At the time the local priest says "God has given you a son."?? yeah, right. Let me know how that works out for ya.Cut to about 3 years later, Robert is promoted to be the US ambassador to the United Kingdom, resulting in an immediate move for the family and the young Damien.When Damien turns 5 they throw a big party at their home, this is where it gets messy. The family nanny sees a dog lurking nearby, a pitch black dog (a rottweiller?), for whatever reason the nanny seems impelled to take dramatic action, she goes to the first floor and wraps a noose around her neck and throws herself off the edge. But not before screaming something to the effect of "This is all for you Damien!" In the resultant chaos Damien spies the dog, still lurking, and gives him a friendly wave.At the party - and at most major events that occur to the family over the next cinematic hour - a photographer is snapping away all the while.A few days later in rolls Father Brennan to the embassy who asks to speak to Robert, who initially agrees. After he goes off on a bit of a tirade rabbitting on all sorts of ominous doomsday stuff, he is turfed.Enter the SuperNanny Mrs Baylock, she arrives unintroduced and unrequested at the home, and while she appears quite nice and professional you can tell immediately something ain't quite right with her (especially when she goes into Damien's room and it appears that she doesn't have any white parts in her eyes!) Evidence keeps building up against the poor little tacker, obviously the nanny suicide being exhibit A - for now...Over the ensuing few days: - A trip to church sends Damien into a cuckoo-bananas frenzy, forcing them to abandon the sermon and; - A day out at the local drive-through safari park shows Kathy that even animals have fear and hatred for Damien, especially the baboons who go (wait for it) apesh**.Initially Kathy blames herself for Damien and actually asks for psychological help for herself, where she claims that Damien is not her child, and that he is evil. You'd think that at this point the right thing to do would be for Robert to 'fess up but in his mind the lie got him this far, what more could go wrong? Father Brennan shows again at a local rugby match, telling Robert to meet him the following day for 5 minutes only as his wife is in danger. When Robert meets him Brennan spouts a lot of nonsensical sounding gibberish and tells him he must visit some guy to "Tell him how to kill the child". Upon parting ways, a storm flares up from nowhere and "follows" Father Brennan who seeks solace at a church, though things don't go so well for him when there? The straw that breaks the camel's back is when Damien is fanging around the first floor on his tricycle and seemingly makes a beeline for Kathy as she stands on a table watering houseplants. This scene is quite famous and has been parodied a few times, there are many quick cuts between Damien, Mrs Baylock and an oblivious Kathy, and when she falls off the balcony the camera follows her to the floor.I don't feel that I'm giving too much away to this point when the poster has a picture of the boy with glowing red eyes. Damien is Satan's spawn.There I said it.Anyway once the photographer gets involved and contacts Robert things heat up, Robert decides to investigate for his family's sake and this takes him on a long quest first to a hospital in Rome, then a monastery, then an abandoned cemetery, and finally a city near Jerusalem. He must have racked up some frequent flyer miles! The climax is slightly tacky after such a prolonged deliberate build up and almost felt like a let down, but the final scene was effective and set up the sequel which was apparently inevitable even though this film was made in 1978, and sequelitis wasn't yet rampant in Hollywood.Even after a movie which dealt with the son of Satan and his attempt to take over the world by using a small boy, I was never actually scared or even nervous watching the movie. I might remind you that The Exorcist came out before this film and it was very edgy and way more scary than this, but The Omen was well acted and for some reason I like movies that pose theological questions or theories.Final Rating ? 7 / 10. Perhaps hasn't aged that well and gore hounds look elsewhere, but a well made film and worth a look to escape the usual "High School Cannibal Cheerleaders 11 - IN 3D!!".If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is equal to or better than "Rosemary's Baby," depending on your tastes. It certainly is one of the great Hollywood horror movies. Don't waste your time on the three sequels. "The Omen" is the only Damien film that is worth seeing, unless you have nothing better to do. It has the scariest graveyard scene on film. Those rottweilers still give me the willies each time I watch the flick. And unless you've read the book already the surprise of what Robert Thorn and Keith Jennings find when they open the mother's grave is horrendous. There are several other almost equally frightening parts. Watch out for the baboons.The movie plays like a Greek tragedy. The Book of Revelations states what is to happen. The Greeks called it fate. Christians call it prophesy. Doris Day called it "Que sera, sera." There is no cop out at the end. Director Richard Donner sticks to his guns and delivers shock after shock.Who could ask for a better cast? Gregory Peck plays his character to perfection. He could very well be the U.S. ambassador to the Court of St. James. The standout performance is given by Billie Whitelaw in the meaty role of Mrs. Baylock, the devil's own. She has to compete with the devil dog who almost steals the show. This movie is not for the squeamish. If you like edge of the seat terror and suspense, get ready for a winner. The eerie music by Jerry Goldsmith, third to Bernard Herrman's "Psycho" score and John Carpenter's "Halloween" music, only adds to the chills. And Whatever happened to young Harvey Stephens who plays Damien? Look closely at your Presidential ballot in 2008.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Omen... it's a great film, and one of the best of the horror genre. It still remains atmospheric and genuinely frightening after all this time, and no matter how many times I've watched it the impact is still there. One or two parts may have dated slightly, other than that, and knowing me it's me being picky, there's little to complain about. the Omen is especially held together by a truly unsettling atmosphere and some imaginative death scenes. Jerry Goldsmith's score is also fantastic, and the film looks very nice. Richard Donner's direction is excellent, the pacing is just about right and the cast is distinguished, not only from Gregory Peck but also from David Warner, Leo McKern and especially Lee Remick as well as a genuinely terrifying Billie Whitelaw. In conclusion, just great and highly recommended. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Omen starts in 'Rome June 6th - 6AM' where the rich &amp; powerful Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) is told by Father Spiletto (Martin Benson) that his recently born son is dead, that his wife Katherine (Lee Remick) is not aware of it yet &amp; that a replacement new born baby is ready if he wants it. Thorn accepts the offer &amp; brings the boy Damien (Harvey Stephens) up as if he was his own, shortly after Thorn is appointed the American ambassador of England where he &amp; his family move. However, when Damien turns the age of five things start to turn somewhat nasty. Holly (Holly Palance), Damien's nanny, decides to commit suicide by hanging herself in front of Thorn &amp; his guests. A vicious Rottweiler starts hanging around the Thorn estate, Father Brennan (Patrick Troughton) pays Thorn a visit &amp; desperately tries to warn him of his son, Damien freaks out whenever he goes anywhere near a church, Katherine becomes pregnant but loses the baby in an 'accident' &amp; they hire the nanny from hell Mrs. Baylock (Billie Whitelaw). A nosey photographer named Keith Jennings (David Warner) starts to dig a little &amp; becomes aware of the strange goings-on, he contacts Thorn &amp; as they investigate they slowly arrive at a theory that they may be dealing with the Antichrist himself...Directed by Richard Donner The Omen is a classic horror that plays well even today, two decades after it's initial release. The script by David Seltzer is a little slow in places but still managed to engage &amp; interest me throughout, the character's are strong &amp; as a whole the story &amp; plotting are solid. The little kid Damien looks real evil but is barely in the film &amp; most of the running time is spent on Thorn trying to figure out what's going on. The Omen was made in 1976 &amp; has dated extremely well, both in terms of story &amp; it's overall look without many hideous 70's hairdo's &amp; clothes to date it. Director Donner does a good job at building the tension &amp; considering the small sounding $2,800,000 budget The Omen is remarkably well made. The fantastic decapitation scene is one of the best ever committed to film although the rest of the violence in The Omen is disappointingly tame by comparison. The cinematography is great, very classy &amp; stylish. Jerry Goldsmith won an Oscar for his brilliant music &amp; as a whole The Omen has very nice production values &amp; a polished feel throughout. The acting is strong by a good cast, apparently Charlton Heston, Roy Scheider &amp; William Holden all turned down the leading role eventually taken by veteran actor Gregory Peck who hadn't worked prior to The Omen for five years &amp; took a cut in salary, make of that what you want... Overall I liked The Omen, it makes for good entertainment &amp; it has a certain greatness about it. Worth watching just for that cool decapitation scene &amp; Jerry Goldsmith's score alone...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In what was an obvious attempt to ride the coattails of The Exorcist from Hell &amp; back and all the way to the bank, Richard Donner's The Omen, with a few rare exceptions, is an out-and-out predictable snoozefest. Gregory Peck &amp; Lee Remick play the stupidest parents in the world, as the plot blatantly &amp; purposefully unfolds to reveal their mysteriously adopted son as the son of the Devil (gasp!). The audience is let in on this nefarious fact about 15 minutes into the film, yet Peck doesn't fully admit this obvious fact to himself until the final reel. The rest of the film is knee deep in plot contrivance, murky religious symbolism, nonsensical logic &amp; lots and lots of Latin, crucifixes, impalings &amp; hounds from Hell.Peck's right eyebrow remains raised for nearly the entire movie, which I suppose is his way of conveying emotion. Otherwise, he makes for a fine robot. Remick fares no better as the bewildered in-denial Mom. David Warner (nice scarf) is decent as a doomed photographer who "helps" Peck unravel the "mystery" of his son's origin.Points to Jerry Goldsmith for a memorably creepy score &amp; for the effective casting of a cherubic child actor as Damien. If you're looking for scares &amp; logic, watch The Exorcist twice. Hell, watch The Exorcist 3 twice. 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror masterclass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following on from The Exorcist, The Omen is a horror film that gained itself instant notoriety for it's dissection of Christian theology to create a horror movie. However, despite it's many macabre incidents and dark mythology, The Omen is actually a family drama. The focus is always kept on the family at the centre of the story, and fatherly love makes up the backbone of the story, while also creating much of the horror. That's what puts this film above many other horror films of a similar nature; it creates it's scenario first, completes it with interesting characters that you can relate to and care for, and then it adds the horror; by which point it is all the more powerful, owing to the fact that the audience has some feeling for the characters. Horror works much better when it has backbone and emotion behind it, and The Omen proves that. Of course, the fact that The Omen is more than technically sound isn't exactly incidental to the film's success with horror and art fans alike, as this film features fabulous directing, some great acting and an intelligent, mature script. And, despite the fact that movie is largely story based, we are still treated to some glorious gory highlights, which include a spire being flung through a priest, and what is maybe the best decapitation ever filmed.Gregory Peck, who gives one of his all time best performances, stars as Robert Thorn; the American ambassador in Britain whose wife had a still born baby. Unbeknown to her, Thorn decides, on the recommendation of a priest that is present, to take the child of another family as his own. However, things go awry for the family when it turns out that this child is the Antichrist. The name 'Damien' is more famous than the movie itself. Damien is absolutely perfect name for this movie as despite being an everyday, ordinary name; it has a true horror ring to it. Owing to this film, if there really was an Antichrist; I would expect him to be called Damien. The film is topped off by a great score, which is very over the top, but it works magnificently nonetheless. The theme song that plays over the opening credits is incredible and belongs right near the summit of the list of best themes ever composed for a movie. Religion has proved itself on many occasions to make a great subject for a horror movie, and it has more than done it in this film. It takes obvious influence from earlier seventies horrors, such as The Exorcist, but it does it in an original way and the result is one of the greatest horror movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just one of the best 1970s horror films - one of the best horror films full stop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic religious horror film about the Antichrist, enlivened by fine performances from a distinguished cast, inventive and outrageous special effects, superior Oscar-winning music from Jerry Goldsmith, and excellent production values. This and THE EXORCIST remain the best religious-themed horror films of the 1970s. For once, we get an original tale for this film. As an added bonus, it was filmed in Britain, which adds authenticity for me as a viewer. Gregory Peck is perfectly cast as the father who is forced to realise that his son is evil. The film manages to be genuinely chilling, helped somewhat by the classic music which many films have used since. The best example of this is the build up to Troughton's death, where a storm blows hundreds of leaves around and the music plays loudly, alerting us to the fact that another impending death is due.Speaking of deaths, this film has lots of them, and they're all fantastic: hanging, impaling, falling, stabbing, shooting, and finally decapitation, which is the most spectacular of them all, and much remembered by those who have seen the film. They're meaningful and exciting, for a change, unlike those in most slasher flicks I can think of. Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, Patrick Troughton and especially David Warner are all good actors and actresses and it shows. Warner in particular plays a sympathetic but doomed character. The film was hugely successful and has spawned three sequels so far, two of which continue the same formula with Damien, but the last one decided that the evil one was a girl and is best forgotten. Inventive, chilling, and totally convincing, THE OMEN is a must for every movie fan. A classic, what more can I say?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for the sake of strange amusing interest alone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw 1976s "the omen" after my parents raved about how good it was. I had heard decent things about it previously and the Rotten tomatoes score was good, so I went OK. After I've seen it, I have no idea why its held up as as a great example of horror. Because one thing a good horror movie should do is actually SCARE me. Did this thing scare me? Not in the slightest. Do you no why? Because for a majority of this film It was Hilarious. At first the opening is so ridiculously cheesy that a mouse would be in paradise, and then it expects us to take seriously a suicide that is shot and framed so poorly that I wanted to burst out laughing. The choice of score is so over the top at this scene that It only contributes to this feel. I assume that I'm supposed to take this seriously yet its almost shot like a comedy. this one scene is the OMEN for what come throughout the rest of the film. camera-work that do'sent command a horrific presence contributing to a films atmosphere that feels so internally awkward that the whole production suffers due to it. The shots are handled in a position that feels unfitting for the genre. Some characters don't really speak right so its hard to personally relate to them when something bad happens. Not to mention the use of musical score here is horrendous. At time its understated and playing in the back of scenes that don't need it, and at others its so melodramatic that i could feel the quality drop instantly. That isn't to say I didn't enjoy watching the film. All of these factors blend together to make the film so bad that its good, a hilariocity, if I may borrow a term from critic Chris Stuckmann. Though at the same time I don't feel overly comfortable branding it as bluntly as that; there is good material present. The cast is actually quite good, and however much some dialogue feels clunky or unrealistic, they're almost able to deliver their lines competently. Not to mention that the second act is really good. The tone is shifted to where the movie turns into a cool thriller in which the characters are looking for answers. In many ways the Camera-work fits this idea for the story much better. this portion of the plot only shows that the overarching premise is really good and that the execution is whats sub par. Though at the same time, however good this is, talking about it does bring up tonal inconsistencies. The last good thing is that the plot is able to flow together consistently irregardless of the seconds acts departure in story type. Sadly the third act falls back into the trappings of the first act but with some different problems. I can actually determine the split second where it suddenly CUT(hint to where it was) and I was like "oh! its back.". The actions of the main character feel rather careless and also dumb in the third act, along with rather poor lighting in the darker shot scenes and a really awkward fading edit at one point in the finale. So overall the omen is a weird thing that's hard to describe as a movie I could recommend. But it may be good for the sake of strange amusing interest alone. 3.666/10.I guess I just don't like this movie while others do. thats fine I guess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose that for its time maybe it was a better movie, but I have to admit that by today's standards this movie is below average. You could tell what was going to happen from the very start to the end, it was not scary at all and the performances besides Gregory Peck's were not anything special. It did contain one or two creepy scenes just for you not to fall asleep. In my opinion, it is nowhere near the level of originality and creepeness of the exorcist. Who doesn't remember the intro music of that old gem without getting the chills? Overall, I think that the 7.6 is very generous if we consider that some of the best horror movies of 90s and 00s do no even get past 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the movie regardless if it was gruesome, scary or full of deaths. It does make you feel like you are cursed in a way, it's not real but you do feel that someone is watching you lol. The Omen does remind you a lot of "The Shining" except the child was already the son of Lucifer. I would've loved to have seen the dark God in this actually! I never knew there was an actual novel of the movie, it probably did get it all but again, no film ever does. When you look at even a Harry Potter book, you would realise that there are important story points missing in the film series!I think if Damien was already killed off, then it wouldn't need to have sequels. It was really a bad idea as well to make "The Omen" a remake. I never would be a fan of remakes or sequels, Hollywood just ruins the title! If anyone is planning to watch this movie, watch it in the daytime but night, you get a better sleep and you would easily forget about it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Evil In A Small Package</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen is a 1976 supernatural horror film directed by Richard Donner. This film was released to wide criticism due to it's intense subject matter. The film stars Gregory Peck and Lee Remick as Robert and Kathy Thorn, a wealthy couple who are raising a son named Damien, played by Harvey Stephens. At Damien's fifth birthday party a strange and shocking incident perpetrated by his babysitter sets off a set of terrifying events that shape the entire premise of the film. Soon both parents begin to suspect that their son is not who he appears to be. Confirmation comes in the form of the constant warnings from a local priest named Father Brennan. On several occasions he warns Robert of his son's malicious intentions. He sends him to Megiddo, a city in Israel. It's here that Robert learns the true nature of his son's conception and how he must stop him. With equally stunning performances from Billie Whitelaw and David Warner, this film progresses smoothly and the viewer is never bored. It wraps up beautifully with a climactic battle between good and evil. I recommend The Omen for anyone who is a fan of psychological/supernatural horror. It's a must-see classic from a decade where film was at an all time high.</fullReview>

Of course the acting is on top level as well and the plot is picked on a long shot.Little Damien was remarkable during his scenes and the scary parts are still scary after 37 years. I just regret that i couldn't watch it earlier because i think it would have even better effect on me than now.If you are looking for a movie that scares you, this is what you need to see.

		<fullReview>Who would call a film about supernatural forces "inconceivable"? Well, me!It is not about the existence of the devil or that it might have a son, we already accepted this as the core of the film. But does it mean that everything else in the movie should be illogical too? How could two people survive an attack by several Rottweilers with minor injuries? How could the nanny get into the ambassador's wife hospital room, throw her out of the window then leave peacefully? And the biggest problem of all, did it look as if he was the American ambassador in London at all? I mean his first nanny kills herself, he meets a priest who dies few minutes later, then he takes a friend to Israel, have a public fight with him ending in knives being thrown and the friend getting killed.... Wouldn't you think someone would have noticed that the most important American ambassador is acting weird? That was the 1970s, but media, Israeli police, and The State Department were existent then for heaven's sake!! And in that last scene, there is a huge plot hole; the Police in the UK do not carry firearms. They have something called "Armed Response Unit" which they call for when they think they are facing an armed criminal. But for a regular officer to be carrying a gun like this is just unreal.That is a very good film, but the flaws are so immense they make my 7 seem very gratuitous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The peak of Satanic Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen is a truly accomplished work, brilliantly conceptualised and delivered and, in 1976, released to a world that was still susceptible to all things Satanic, coming on the back of such epics as Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist. Indeed, The Omen represents the peak of this thematic era and has never been bettered. It is a film that works well on so many levels, taking a fantastical storyline - based around the child of a woman impregnated by a jackal - and yet somehow making it seem plausible. This is achieved through a combination of dynamics, foremost among which is the homework carried out by the writer, David Seltzer, in seeking to fulfil the apocalyptic prophecies of the New Testament Book of Revelations (principally the emergence of the Anti-Christ) through a twentieth century cinematic medium. Added to this, is the wonderful cast drafted in to imbue the scenario with credence. The film makers could scarcely believe their luck in securing the services of Gregory Peck in the lead role of Ambassador Robert Thorn, one of the most iconic stars of mainstream cinema, known for being choosy about the roles in which he would deign to appear, yet consenting to completely depart from the mainstream in this capacity, presumably because he too was inspired by the script and its potential. Marlon Brando once famously described Peck as 'wooden'. Reserved, perhaps, certainly steadfast and un-excitable, but either way - ideal for this part, serving as a well-balanced, level-headed, sensible diplomat, not at all disposed to the realms of fantasy, yet who is progressively forced to accept that he is nurturing the son of Satan due to the compelling sequence of events that unhappily befall him. Then there are the wonderful supporting acting abilities of Lee Remick - the woman he loves and so passionately strives to protect; David Warner - the photographer who pieces the mystery together, helping to persuade Thorn of the reality of his situation by coolly and clinically presenting the evidence; Patrick Troughton, who delivers possibly his greatest performance as the guilt-ridden priest; Billie Whitelaw as the truly creepy nanny - 'an apostate of Satan'; and - of course - the young Harvey Stephens, as the child, Damien, famously smiling among the tombstones at the end of the film, as all around him who have tried to thwart his diabolical destiny have been returned to dust. But above all, the film works simply because it grips the viewer on a psychological level, the intrigue maintained by excellent plot development and pacing, beautiful camera work and an unforgettable musical score throughout by Jerry Goldsmith.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie on TV when I was 14. At the time I found it so disturbing I couldn't sleep for days! However, having now viewed this a number of times I think one of the key elements of this movie's success is the fantastic chilling soundtrack, which only enhances the feeling of suspense and evil which is a bubbling undercurrent throughout the film.There is an edge of constant paranoia with a mix of inevitability throughout the movie. Although you know certain characters will come to a sticky end way before it happens you are kept in a certain amount of suspense (which will keep you on the edge of your seat) until it does.This movie is a definite classic in my books, and even now, many years after my first viewing I still feel slightly edgy after watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't watch the remake see this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>some of you might recognize this title as it was remade in 2006. Let me just say that the 2006 remake is a pointless and useless movie. The remake did not elaborate on anything that The Omen (1976) didn't all ready do. In fact, it is almost a shot for shot remake. So what the hell was the point in remaking this f*cking movie!? I understand if you watch a movie and think, "Hey I can do this better" and then you attempt to do so, but the remake was the same movie with nothing new to offer at all. So save yourself the trouble and see the original so you don't have to watch Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles try to act.The original Omen also had a huge impact on horror film making. It is one of the first movies to have outlandish death scenes. Like the famous decapitation, which ,to this day, still is one of the best decapitations ever filmed. Future horror films would follow The Omen's lead, especially during the slasher craze of the 80s, and have violent, bloody, and original death scenes.Do yourself a favor and see this classic movie and skip the weak remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Omen is a 1976 suspense/horror film directed by Richard Donner and starring Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, David Warner, Harvey Stephens, Billie Whitelaw, Patrick Troughton, Martin Benson, and Leo McKern. It is the first film in the Omen series and it is based on a horror novel by David Seltzer.Though part of a cycle of similarly-themed movies, The Omen has gained prestige over time for a number of reasons: its respectability (as a profitable major-studio film with renowned actors), its seriousness (it plays as a contemporary thriller, rather than with the knowing excesses of certain aspects of the horror genre), and the originality of the movie's Jerry Goldsmith score.The movie followed at the tail end of a cycle of 'demonic child' movies: Village of the Damned, Rosemary's Baby, and most notably The Exorcist, and was itself followed by sequels (see below) and a number of copycat films such as the Italian-made Kirk Douglas movie Holocaust 2000. As a general rule, the children concerned get older as the cycle continues, from the newborn of Rosemary's Baby to the teens of such films as Carrie, The Fury and Halloween.A new version, The Omen, was released on June 6, 2006 (06/06/06).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Omen" is certainly unique in that it revolves around religious views and the views of the coming horror on the world, known as the "Anti-Christ" or "Armagedon" or the "End of the World". However, this film is no different from "Rosemary's Baby", which is why I've given it 8 as opposed to ten- the idea is rather unoriginal."The Omen", I WILL admit, has some INCREDIBLY scary moments, such as the opening hanging of the old nanny. (Personally, I can't tolerate seeing hangings of people- that gets to me.) It's idea biblically and the way that the creators organized their ideas were quite admirable as well.I would say that this, like "The Exorcist" and "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" challenges your faith, and tests it, but if it were just more original, I'd be perfectly, 100% content with giving it ten stars. (Or nine, as of course, it's not an absolutely perfect movie.) But, I'd recommend it. I own it- (all three sequels as well...) and I'd say it's well worth the view.</fullReview>

Other than a few grim death scenes, which are rather cheesy looking by today's standards, there is nothing that would really want to make you close your eyes and mute the TV. However, it's the after-effects of watching the movie that really get to you. As soon as it is over, you want to hide, or run to the nearest church. I would definitely consider this a psychological thriller. The acting is all top notch, (suprising for a horror movie), the dialouge is not dumbed down, and the music (it's called "Ave Satani", for anyone who wants to listen) is absolutely one of the best scores ever written. After seeing the movie, it will make your blood run cold when you hear it. So grab some popcorn, turn out the lights, and get ready for a scare.</fullReview>

I preferred this version to the new one and it still stands the test of time.It's amazing that by letting you see the deaths by photograph's of Jennings (david warner), before they happen like, the nanny, the priest and Jennings himself. It's very well done in this way, and although you see the photo's before the deaths the deaths are still shocking.The only deaths that you don't know of are of course damien's mum and dad, that would be spoiling the film a bit.The most horrible death scene is the decapitation of Jennings, it is shocking and has got to be the first of it's kind. Deaths/injury's in order: The Nanny - Hangs herself The Priest - Gets impaled Damien's Mum - Fall's from the stair rail - injured Jennings's/Photographer - Get's decapitated Damien's mum - Get's thrown out of hospital window 7eral floors up.

		<fullReview>WARNING AGAIN: THIS COMMENT WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS.Hey, folks. With the release of the remake of THE OMEN, 30 years later, I thought I should make some comments on the original. I can't remark on the 2006 remake, haven't seen it yet. But I do know, critics are bashing it, but audiences think it's a great tribute to the original. So much for critics. How do they get those jobs, anyway? Telling me what movie, I'm gonna like. If a film critic can write, direct, and act in a film like I have, then they can speak. If not, they should shut up.OK. Enough said on my hatred for movie critics, on to the original, THE OMEN. I saw this movie when I was about 14. Loved it then, love it now. A classic, to say the least.Here we have Robert Thorn, played greatly by Gregory Peck. He's been elected U.S. Embassedor to England. Also, a good candidate to be the next president of the United States. With a great wife, Kathy (played by Remick) it looks like their dreams are coming true. But these dreams will soon become one big nightmare...Robert never told Kathy that their child died during the birth, and he adopted a baby never telling her, to spare her the trauma. So, the child they're raising is THE ANTICHRIST.There are no dull moments in the film. It grabs you from the beginning, as we watch the people we care about die, one at a time. It does have a sad/tragic side to it, which other horror films do not. With several warnings and events, Robert soon learns he's raising the son of the Devil.The music by Jerry Goldsmith is the scariest in any film I've ever seen. Other characters who were outstanding include, The Priest who Robert thinks is nuts, the photographer, the first nanny (what a sore throat) the new nanny who will protect thee, and many more.I highly suggest you check out the original. It's a little dated, but still holds up as an excellent horror film. Director, Richard Donner, knew what he was doing.I give this classic a 10/10.V.M." I saw it's mother, Mr. Thorne." - Priest on Morphine. LOL....</fullReview>

The Omen is a fantastic horror film, no doubt about it. Lee Remick wears the look of terror well and Billie Whitlelaw's performance of Mrs. Baylock is truly terrifying.The musical Composition by Jerry Goldsmith was eerie and effective as Rottweilers Eyes Glow Red and Damien Smiles to their spirits. The images in the photography were creepy and actually become fun riddles for first time viewers. What does that white line going through his neck mean? The poor Priest.

		<fullReview>There's no doubt that 'The Omen' was one of the scariest movies in the 1970s, second to that of 'The Exorcist'. Both these deal with enemies of God; in 'The Exorcist', it's a girl who's possessed by a devil,and in 'The Omen', there's a child who is the Antichrist himself!! It's perhaps strange to have the central antihero not physically killing those around him, but whose evil energy is doing the deed!! The scenes in the movie where a photographer takes pictures of those who later died under strange circumstances, and the photographs revealing uncanny marks running diagonally across the person exhibited in the photographs, which seems to foreshadow what was going to happen, is quite frightening! Even more frightening is when the photographer shows a photo of himself to Robert Thorn (played by the late Gregory Peck) which shows a mark running through the photographer in the picture, which seems to foreshadow that he's going to die too like the others!! And sure enough it happens when the photographer is horribly decapitated later in the movie!!! Gregory Peck displays great intensity in this film and this is the second time I have watched his performance (the first time I saw of him was as Captain Ahab in the film, 'Moby Dick' (1956)). The film, though it doesn't have great special effects as would please a modern audience of the horror genre, it's nevertheless really scary than the movies of nowadays which seem to have stepped a little away from the real essence that provides great scares and chills!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lets go round again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The bi-annual showing of The Omen on BBC1 is upon us again, and as usual starts around midnight on a week-night. Late for work the following day, then.....I first saw The Omen when I was twelve, and although I was unable to sleep with the door closed for two years after, I have become a lifelong fan.Director Richard Donner perfectly captures the imposing gloom of England in the Autumn, which sets the tone for all that follows. I love the early scene on the Thames embankment when the priest meets Gregory Peck to tell him about his son - the sense of foreboding is most striking. Also, the graveyard scene in Italy where they travel to find the tomb of Damien's natural mother is feverishly disturbing - I still have palpitations whenever I hear the dogs....... There are some great frights throughout, but it's the subtlety elsewhere that delights the most. For example, the usage of slow-mo camera when Peck checks Damiens scalp for 'the number' generates an effect that is extremely unsettling, especially when the frame pans and you see the nanny watching from the doorway. I can't think of a more creepy scene in any other film.Roll on Wednesday night......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is a very, very, shocking movie!! imagine that you have a child. he is 4 or 5 years old. you go to church and you are taking your child with you. then you arrive at the church and your poor little baby-boy starts to scream and begins to hit you!! who would not be surprised?! then you are going to a zoo and all the animals are frightened when they see your child!! this movie is making me thinking about what should happen, when such an evil child will be born!!! this movie is an older one and it is a really good one!! I recently bought the trilogy-box and I haven,t seen the other two yet. suppose if,just suppose if, what should you do?! Miss.Baylock was perfect. such an evil spirit in her eyes!!the scene with the priest at the church. the door is locked and it is storming and then the lightning strikes and kills the priest!!! this movie is far better then the exorcist!!! and it makes me really afraid about what could happen!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This classy shocker was included in a book "The Fifty Worst Movies Of All Time" and got a complete roasting from the authors.Why? I haven't got a clue.It doesn't seem to take itself all that seriously anyway and what it does offer is a thrilling couple of hours entertainment.It is daft(David Seltzer-the author of the novel,claimed he did it strictly for the money),but it is carried off with sheer professionalism,that you don't really care.Gregory Peck gives one of his best performances of his later career, and when the death scenes appear on the screen-they are brilliantly staged.A throughly enjoyable piece of horror hokum which did really well at the box office,so it couldn't of been that bad eh? Apart from "The Exorcist" one of the best of the Seventies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Horror Collection par excellence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unless you're a Hammer Horror Fan, this is THE Horror Collection you were waiting for.Good acting, mixed with good and chilling stories make these the one to own.This is a TRILOGY. Unfortunately Fox Studios tried to rehash it for TV a fourth time without even coming near to the first and only three original ones. It is divided like an opera in three acts.Remember that the caliber of cast members in the first three ranges from Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, David Warner to William Holden, Lee Grant and finally Sam Neill.A cast who could never be assembled for a TV movie.The first act, "The Omen", is perhaps the best of the trilogy because it introduces us to the Evil one. The protagonists are as shocked and horrified when they learn, step by step as we do, who and what the Evil one is and is planning to do. &gt;From there on we are involved in an intensive investigation and a race against time to save the world from what is to come, if at all possible...The second act, "Damien - Omen II", is the natural evolution of the first one, in which we follow the growth in strength and power of Lucifer (or Satan if you prefer, although his name is never openly pronounced in all three movies). The interesting part is when the Evil one gets confirmation of who He really is and suddenly has a "panic attack" followed by sheer despair!Act three, "Omen III - The Final Conflict", is the Apotheosis of the Trilogy in which Damien is at the top of the world, literally. He is finally ready to take possession of his Kingdom on Earth. People are ready, conditions are ready and it seems there's nothing able to stop him. Nothing, except...Less gory than the Exorcist, The Omen Trilogy still has vicious and very graphic death scenes. The beauty of them is that there is no direct murder involved, at least not in the first two. They all happen by accident and very conveniently...The Horror doesn't come in the form of monsters or decaying flesh, but is brought to us by angelic beings and "natural" coincidences, which make this even more controversial and eerie than any other Horror movie ever made.Also consider the haunting Evil Messianic Chants for Choir and Full Symphonic Orchestra composed by Jerry Goldsmith for all three movies. They all are masterpieces in musical composition and if the movies won't scare you, then the music will.Everything is well balanced. The acting, the stories, the effects and the music, they all promise you a true ride through Hell on Earth.Truly not for the faint-hearted. If you're easily scared by a door squeaking or a window lashing then forget all about it. This trilogy can truly cause you nightmares without end.Moreover, if you're the religious believer, be advised, this is nothing for you, even though references are just very loosely based on the Scriptures it still might cause you some problems.For all the others, go ahead, make the Devil's Day!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't scare easily,, but this movie gave me the heebie jeebies bigtime!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies that involve the devil and satan are the only ones that really bug me,, and the Omen is one of the scariest movies of all time, next to the Excorcist.Great performances by acting legends Gregory Peck and Lee Remick make the movie all the more real. The fact that it takes place in England for some reason makes the movie even spookier. The part that gave me the willies was when the Photographer was developing pictures of the people who had died, and they had red lines through them. The script, the fine acting, the dialogue, everything seemed true to life, and all of these ingredients mixed together made a highly effective horror movie- they really don't make horror movies like this anymore. Unfortunately, the sequels weren't as good. The Omen deserves 9*** out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am aware that most movie fans favorite 70's horror film is probably "The Exorcist" but mine is this film. I also like the two sequels as well. This "Damien" series to me is a classic of the genre.Gregory Peck and David Warner (a very underrated actor) give simply great performances. The music score won an Oscar and deservedly so. I suggest every fan of classic horror films buy "The Omen Collection" on DVD. You won't regret it.Does anybody know where the actor who played Damien is today?

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you were to find out that the reason your child had been acting funny was that because not only was he the epitome of all evil, but also the son of Satan, what would YOU do?That is the dilemma faced by Gregory Peck's character in this film, in a very suspenseful, eerie tale of diabolical nightmares.The acting in this film is terrific, and Gregory Peck's performance is impeccable, which really takes the film to another level. The pacing of the film works very well, with many suspenseful buildups of impending horror, including some of the most classic scenes of all time.The decapitation, Priest impaling, Damien's famous "tricycle ride", Damien's first signs of trouble at the church at a wedding, and the gravesite dig's revelation that Damien's mother was a jackal are all fantastic scenes, classics.The film paces itself so well so that up until the very end you can feel the hairs stand on the back of your neck.The second film was good, but didn't touch this one, and the third suffered from inconsistencies and continuity problems within the series. But this one is almost flawless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They don't make them like this any more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this film for the third time, and I must say I enjoyed it more than my first two times.The Omen is very similar to the Exorcist in the way children are portrayed as evil. In some way this film even betters the far more infamous Exorcist with several memorable cinema moments, most notably the priest being impaled and the decapitation scene. These are scenes which you won't forget your whole life. The storyline is excellently driven by religion and the book of revelations, the whole story falls into place until the father gradually learns the real truth. Characters that are built up the whole way through are dispatched by the devils disciples or invisible forces, very unsettling indeed. The characters absence actually means something and you really begin to feel for the family of Robert and Kathy Thorn.Bereft of bad language, sex, or drugs, this movie is straight to the point and never lets up for a minute to break the evil atmosphere. This is gruesome cinema at its best.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the greatest horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people (some here apparently not among them) would put The Omen in the horror top ten. I think it is better than that. I think it is the best horror movie of all time. Incredibly tense and frightening throughout, with a very serious theme, great acting, and outstanding technical work, this one just surpasses them all. Satan as a purely evil, murderous, wealthy child--"Damian", religious characters, imagery and subject-matter, suspense, crazed, murderous dogs and servants, style, even sex appeal, etc., etc. This goes beyond the Exorcist because it is a bigger, more complete movie, and it beats Rosemary's Baby because it is more entertaining. Granted, those movies are great and top 5, but this is better. One of the two roles for which more modern audiences will remember Gregory Peck, the other being the timeless classic, To Kill A Mockingbird. Peck's stature and dignity are equally great in both roles.</fullReview>

And the acting was very good, and convincing. And the part when the priest get's killed was very cool and well done. Overall I give the omen a very well deserving 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary, and lots of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen is a ludicrous, but very entertaining horror movie, saved by the performances of Gregory Peck and Lee Remick as the parents of the little devil, who turns out to be the Antichrist himself. It was released about the same time as a whole spate of movies concerning the devil and possession of children, most notably The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby. The movie does provide some genuine scares though, and it is a lot of fun for fans of the genre. It is a great movie to watch if you don't take it too seriously. The kind of movie you should just watch for a good time with some friends. As long as you can stand a lot of gore and some obvious foolishness, it's great fun</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far more deserving than 'Exorcist' of "scariest movie" bragging rights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The night before I watched 'The Omen,' I'd headed off to bed early because, as usual, I needed more sleep. My brother was still up watching it though, and from my room, adjacent to the living room, I could hear bits and pieces of the dialogue and soundtrack, and it spooked me quite a bit.The next day, in broad daylight, I popped it in. And let me tell you, getting scared by a movie in broad daylight is no small task.Granted, there's really no one scene - except maybe for the very last - that's particularly frightening. The movie as a whole, though, is probably the most unsettling story ever committed to film. I could count off all the freakishly spine-tingling scenes that compose 'The Omen,' but as I'm sitting here typing this, it would probably take too much time to do so.Having rented it just once, I immediately set about procuring my own copy of 'The Omen.' It's gotten plenty of use since then.On a final note - this movie is scary. 'The Exorcist' isn't. It doesn't matter how religious you are - I consider myself somewhat borderline personally - 'Exorcist' just isn't that frightening. 'Omen' is.That said, regardless of what you're looking for in a movie when you rent it, 'Omen' is sure to please no matter what. Watch 'The Exorcist' before this though; that way your disappointment in the first can be turned into glee at what a great film 'Omen' is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a very religious man. I'm a Catholic, and although I don't really believe in good and evil but in power, this movie made me think about the Book of Revelations. It is scary to think that out there, the devil is waiting to come back to Earth and takes us all to hell or something like it. But this movie is scary mostly for that; for what you think is happening. I scared the hell out when Damien is playing around in his tricycle and knocks her mother down. The way he smiles, the way she reacts, the music. Good God, the music. I had downloaded is before watching it an d I was already scares. It a black mass and if you don't understand what they're saying I do: Ave Satani (Hail Satan.) It's very good, and it really makes you think about your soul, the future of humanity and all that stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a brilliant chilling masterpiece with letter-perfect performances by a great cast. Everything about this movie, from the Gregorian chanting to the monstrous nanny to the creepy child to the dogs of hell, evokes a sense of suffocating, ominous, impending doom. This tension and horror ratchet up step by step until the viewer is overwhelmed by the unknown approaching apocalypse. Every death is accompanied by slow-mo shattering glass (first time that was done), shocking mechanics, and strong premonitions. Even the slo-mo bullet was real- the novel and clever cinematography, like the tyke's bike view, puts you into the skin of the characters. The reluctant Peck, the dawning Remick, the persuasive Warner are dragged progressively into the hideous center of an eternal mystery that they are powerless to resist. The most terrifying scene ever filmed is the attack of the monstrous demonic nanny and I still, when people talk of their mother, have to suppress a yell, "I saw his mother: his mother was a jackal!"I saw this movie at it's world premiere my second day in LA, after a legendary cross country odyssey, I picked up some hitchhikers in New Mexico, and they put me up. The next day we picked up some Swedish girls in a park and the hitcher kids got us all in free into the world premiere showing in Westwood of this movie, which I knew nothing about. It rattled and shocked me deeply, more than any other movie, but incredibly the Swedish girls were laughing throughout, till I was ready to strangle them ("what's the matter- it's just a movie?"). Blondes apparently do have more fun.------Michael Hammerschlag</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** MINOR SPOILER ***Yep, that's true. The Omen left me shaking in my bed just after I saw it. I saw it last night on DVD, lights out, volume really loud, just me, myself and I. The movie seems slow at the beginning, you even start to like Damien, he's cute, adorable, but with a strange, eerie glow in his eyes (a scene is still caught in my mind, when Damien and his mother are in the zoo, watching the giraffees, then they run away, the mother comes from behind, in that moment the kid glimpses to his back, with a curious way of looking, I don't what that really means, either Damien was trying to subliminally say to his mother "Look what I just did, how they fear me", or it was just a goof where the kid was waiting for Lee Remick to hug her...). But all of a sudden you get involved with Gregory Peck's character, Robert Thorn, who finds out his kid is the Antichrist itself. There's where the movie starts playing with our minds, putting fear in our brain, by letting us know that something is about to happen, something horrible will come in the next scene, so when it happens we're scared to death.I dare to say The Omen is way much better that The Exorcist, 'cause what the audience (myself included) really like is to feel terror, not to see it, and this movie gives you that horrifying feeling, feeling that maybe will go to bed with you, the way it did with me.</fullReview>

Say what you'd like about this horror item, it's a hefty slice of what nosey photographers, archaeologists... and just about any other professional, should be hard pressed to do: Mind your own business and allow the prophesied almighty evil forces to play themselves completely out. The Omen Franchise (including "Omen IV--The Awakening," made-for-television) offers occasional stunning photography--their is no defense against violence in these films; just sit back, enjoy the devastation of humanity, and pray that 5 year old Damien (the budding Antichrist) doesn't come knocking on your front door and asks you to come out and play.

		<fullReview>I remember when I was just a little kid. It was an evening when I sat alone in our livingroom. My mom had gone to sleep and my older sister was in her room reading some magazines. So there I was, all alone... watching The Omen...At first glance, I thought it was pretty boring, but as the events started to happen and the plot revealed itself, I was like paralyzed. I simply HAD to watch this movie. There were so many impressions throughout the movie and so many images started to come to my mind. Though I was almost scared to death, I just sat there and watched the mmovie from the beginning to the end. Of course I suffered from the obvious nightmares that followed, and that left a fear in me, a fear of watching this movie again. This fear has accompanied me in my adult life, 20 years later.Some days ago, I had the opportunity to watch the movie again. The scenario was almost the same; I was completely alone! I'm so glad that I overcame the fear (believe me, I'm not easily frightened), because I got the exact same adrenaline-pumping experience. This movie has left a great impression on me that I really can't explain, and to cut it short; This movie is still scary as hell!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Classic Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although many people no doubt consider The Exorcist to be the best horror film of the 1970s, I would cast my vote for The Omen. It is a very atmospheric film, eerie and spooky -- even the soundtrack is really, really creepy -- with a few hair-raising scenes to jolt you out of your seat (the body count in this movie is not actually very high, but when Satan decides it's time for someone to die, it will definitely grab your attention).One of the great strengths of The Omen is its cast, which is really superb. Gregory Peck is perfect as the American Ambassador to England, and his distinguished portrayal lends a touch of class to the whole production. The rest of the cast is also excellent -- Billie Whitelaw is flat-out frightening as the nanny from Hell, David Warner is great as the photographer who helps Peck unravel the mystery of his adopted son, and Lee Remick is effective as the frightened and troubled "mother" of Damien. Even the actors with very limited screen time turn in terrific performances, particularly Patrick Troughton as the seemingly insane priest and Leo McKern as the all-knowing archaeologist/exorcist.One of the spookiest aspects of this movie is that the ultimate villain here is not only extraordinarily formidable but totally unseen, which really adds to the ominous, doomsday-is-around-the-corner atmosphere. When the camera casually closes in on a truck parked on a hill, and the emergency brake mysteriously releases itself, you know something bad is about to happen but you don't know what it will be. And when it does happen, it's worse than anything you expected.</fullReview>

When I first saw it, it kept me awake at night, and I will never be able to watch it again because it is just too much! So shocking, creepy, and disturbing, a genuinely great British horror film-they sure know how to do horror films there! If you are looking for the ultimate scare, I would definitely recommend this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a flat out hilarious comedy (e.g. "The Excorcist")</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was about twelve when I saw this movie for the first time--and man did it freak me out. Unlike The Excorcist, there was no pea soup or head spinning to keep me in tears of laughter...this was just scary...something that the excorcist never really accomplished. It happened one night when the Thorn couple was expecting their baby. Instead they wound up with an adopted infant who's real mother was an animal. They named the new born boy, Damien (which probably was a really innocent name until this movie came out) and he eventually grew into a kindergarten aged murderer with the ability to communicate with rottweilers and order them to do his nasty willing. After his nanny hangs herself (she became possesed) a new satan worshipping woman comes to take her place...she is a follower of the devil and caters to his every need, also telling him what to do.By the movie's end he has killed everyone in his immediate family despite efforts by Gregory Peck to kill the little sucker. This was wicked cool, litterally!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1976 Omen is a great piece of story telling and not knowing too much about the bible it held my interest through out the film. I found myself picking up a copy of the bible for back ground and a little better understanding. I recommend seeing this film for as today it seems like the prophecy is coming true. As usual Jerry Goldsmith music is so haunting through out the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>scariest movie i have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i was 11, there was an Omen marathon on the television with episodes 1 through 4 on back to back, and i decided to watch the first. After been more scared than i have ever been up to that point in my life, and still to this day, i was in no condition to watch the last 3 episodes. In fact it was a good 3 months before i was able to sleep properly again.Its now been a few years since i last watched it so im going on memory here, but the scene with the rotwheilers in the cemetary is the scariest in any movie.The plot is very good, very original for its time, and i thought one of the best things about this movie is that, despite all our urges that tell us a child should be a good guy in a movie, you just wish that you could just see Peck stab Damien in the final scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Still one of the most engrossing horrors of modern cinema. The story of a well to do American ambassador and his wife adopting a child only to find that he is the Antichrist is a great story. Although many films have tried to emulate the story none have quite matched the pace of this film. Bille Whitelaw as the nanny encapsulates the performances and delivers the true atmosphere of the movie. If you haven't seen this film or just not seen it for a while watch it now and be knocked over by its power to impress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my all time favourite movies was "The Exorcist", much because the girl ended up doing so many unnatural moves (like the stairs...)The Omen, however, did not really impress me.The most scary element of the film, may be the dogs. Some people may have a more difficult relationship with Rotweilers, but having had one, I feel they are adorable, and thus the "angry dog effect" of this film did not scare me allot.There are few screy scenes where you walk in dark buildings, few places somebody jumps at you, and little that comes as suprise. In general, the most scary part may be the religious backbone. This is actually the son of the devil himself.Not being afarid of Rotweilers, nor a religions person. Thus, I do not realy feel this movie is very scary. Compared to "The Exorcist", I didn't really like it.However, it is a good film, just not very scary to me (=</fullReview>

It was only scary at some points and the ending made you like this movie because it's not at all a happy hollywood ending. Though it did leave the door open to 3 inferior sequels. The score was brilliant and the dog scenes were weird. But this film drags a bit and tries too hard at some death scenes especially the priest.

		<fullReview>?a charming tale of fate and faith. "The Omen" may not the scariest movie of all time, however it is certainly one of the most enjoyable. It is certainly worth your time to rent. By today's standards it ranks as being quite tame; one can only compare it with it `The Exorcist', however the charm of Damien, Rome, and the perfect family life only help to implore the viewer's attachment. The film looks beautiful and flows nicely. The acting is decent, however not one of Gregory Peck's finest moments. Do not bother watching this on cable, pick up the uncut version ? you'll thank me later. Simply put this an enjoyable movie that scares and humors the viewer. Pay attention to details, enjoy the music, bring your bible, and pray.If you like this movie: Devil's Advocate, The Shining, The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, Village of The Damned (original! b&amp;w)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently rented this film to try and relive the abject terror this film conjured in my memory when I was a kid.Although the element of suspense was alleviated (knowing how it ends), nonetheless, the screenplay continues to thrill.As the horrific truth unfolds, you're totally caught in thestory. The scenes with the "new nanny", the bizarre, shocking and seemingly unexplained suicides...the Rottweilers...the priests, the graveyard scene...how can you help but be kept on the edge of your seat?!Omen II continued with the sinking feeling that evil might actually triumph over good. Omen III I'll have to see again. But, if you've never seen Omen I and II, you're missing out on one of the defining films of the horror genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've recently undertaken a quest to see the "classic" movies that i've heard are classics, but never been particularly interested in.The Omen is one such movie. Everybody knows the "Damien" jokes and stuff, Southpark recently spoofed the theme, but i'd never seen the movie, and it didn't disappoint.The story begins with the birth of a child, not the parent's own, but given to them as it were. Little did they know it was the son of the devil. Time passes and things seem fine until a truely shocking scene involving the death of the families nanny. This movie was made years ago, and i'm not stranger to violence and suspence in film, but this was completely unexpected and genuinely shocking (bare in mind it was late and i was pretty tired).The rest of the movie followed some lines would be considered cliche, but at the time it would have been a pretty big movie, and doesn't at all disappoint in the current environment.Gregory Peck does a fine job as the father despirate to save his family and the photographer roped into the investigation does a good job at keeping it reasonably believeable.Overall a great film, check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An absolute monster of a movie, made all the more creepy and disturbing when you consider the plot is actually quite plausible. Preferring slow-burning chills to out-and-out terror, the Satanic imagery and Biblical references conspire to create an ominous atmosphere throughout. Gregory Peck is immense as the American diplomat who learns his adopted son harbors a terrible secret. Tremendous performances and perhaps the greatest score in modern cinema history make this the best of the Antichrist movies by some way.</fullReview>

I especially like the now infamous decapitation scene and the part where the priest gets impaled by the pole. The effects are pretty cheesy but the part at the cemetary is very intense and scary. The overall look of the film has not withstood the test of time but still it has very good cinematography. This movie is well worth a viewing for fans of the horror genre.

		<shortDescription>The antichrist convinces his parents that he is just that!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie it was in its initial release in 1976. It came on the heels of a true classic in horror; The Exorcist. It dealt with many of the same themes. The eternal combat between good and evil, the place the Catholic Church has in all of that, and the possability that the human beings are nothing more than just chess pieces in this eternal struggle. The Exorcist was a classic; but the Omen was truly a very scary movie. I saw the movie again recently, with my wife who had not previously seen it. I realized why the movie had scared me so many years ago. The same scenes that had such an effect on me scared my wife. The cemetery, the dogs, two strange priests and of course the rolling head. Some cutting edge horror for it's time. And of course the film deals with the eternal battle with the only son of a powerful American ambassador as the ultimate weapon of evil, now incarnate here amongst us. Gregory Peck and Lee Remick are well.....Gregory Peck and Lee Remick: strong, handsome, gracious, wealthy, perfect. Exactly what you would want a first family to be. How ironic just a few years before the release of this movie we had a first family that fit this image so perfectly. And they too left behind the perfect, handsome, well connected, gracious prince. Here of course it falls apart because by all accounts he truly was a good,gracious, righteous prince. But the irony cannot be missed given the release date of this film. I found however that the film now worked on me on a level that it had not back in 1976. As a parent of three the concept that I might be asked to kill one of my children is now a far more terrifing concept than the dogs in a cemetery. To convince me that one of those children was the antichrist would be inconcievable. That is why the final scene is now the scariest for me. Dragging the child through the holy confines of the church to impale him on the alter is beyond comprehension for any parent. And that is the main weakness in the film. We know early that the child is pure evil. If the script had kept us guessing, along with his parents it might have worked better.Not all of us might have been hoping Greory Peck saved the world. Some of us might have been saying" For God's sake your wrong. The boy is just a little strange. Leave him alone". Maybe it would have been better to be left with the question " Is the boy the antichrist and deserves to die, or are the parents just paranoid and committing murder?" It probably would have made for a better sequel. Even so a very scary movie that deserves an EIGHT.</fullReview>

Lee Remick's two "falling scenes" were horrifying, especially the second one. The fact that this family is pretty much just ripped apart from the inside out makes it even creepier. The first step is the disposal of the first nanny and the introduction of a new one. The second step is the death of the new baby which is handled pretty swiftly.

One of my favorite scenes of "The Omen" is at the drive-in zoo, the baboons start attacking the car while Damien and his mom are in it.

I can´t imagine the horror of truly witnessing something like that. What impressed me, was the casual tone of voice -almost tender- that the nanny uses to announce her dismiss. The look of devotion on her face is absolutely frightening.

It seems so real, you almost believe it's totally possible.There are many freaky and scary scenes in this movie from the nanny's suicide to the dogs in the graveyard.

		<shortDescription>A decent horror movie but dated and silly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen starts out boring and slow and has a lot of intrusive, off- putting music. I like the dark choral chant parts but a lot of the rest sounds loud and distracting. It's actually really annoying. Jerry Goldsmith may be a respected and prolific composer but he's never been one of my favourites and I think there are flawed music choices in this movie and much of it is forgettable. It fails to add to the tension but instead makes the viewing experience unpleasant. Dissonance can sometimes just cause headaches rather than suspense.The Omen looks very dated to me. The fashion, cars and directing style all scream 70s in a way that good films from the era do not. Spielberg and Coppola had their own style. The Omen has few cinematic touches that impress me. The child's acting is also quite mediocre. You can almost hear the director yelling things off-screen to get him to react the right way.That was my main problem with this movie. It was hard to get in to. It feels amateurish and slow. I didn't really like Lee Remick's acting although she does transition from happy to fearful and concerned. Gregory Peck is okay but has a strange way of talking that drags things out unnecessarily. His love for his wife and child seems stilted and forced. Maybe that's what upper-class families are like. Their romance feels rushed and fake. Peck must be quite a bit older as well.The movie does get more interesting and the story plays out quite well. As a horror, it's fairly satisfying - you're intrigued by a mystery which the film treats seriously. If you go along for the ride, it's a little scary and fun. You can see the influence this movie has had on many later horror movies. However, most of those movies are terrible and this one has similar flaws. There are strange precursory marks which turn up in photographs, a pattern of strange deaths, references to (made-up) bible passages and the number pattern 666 comes up a few times.None of it holds up though to scrutiny though. Perhaps you have to believe in the Devil or God. What happens is so arbitrary and it's not clear where powers and forces begin and end. Even Dracula has a more consistent set of rules and logic. If you have a brain which you regularly use, you'll see right through the stupidity of these details.In particular, many death scenes are reminiscent of those in the Final Destination series of films. Maybe you're cooking, slip on a puddle of split milk and accidentally fall on your knife and die. And as the audience sees the danger, scary music plays. This stuff doesn't work on me. It's ridiculous and just completely silly. It's disturbing that some people seem to believe in this kind of karma, as if your number's up and an accident is destined to take your life. I'm afraid every effect must have a cause and the spooky "inevitability of fate itself" doesn't count.Some frustrating points now.Why does the priest babble like an insane person? Why can't people calmly communicate and work together in horror films? Hear each-other out and focus on the solid evidence and explore their options? Why can't they test their theories instead of blindly opting one way or the other? Why not show Damien a cross and see how he reacts? Get a priest to talk with him. Read the bible to him. Then you might get somewhere, you'd know either way.Why let a creepy nanny into your house? She doesn't follow instructions, so why would you keep her? Why not look behind you if you hear your son riding his tricycle where he shouldn't be? Why speed, drawing the attention of the police unnecessarily?In summary, The Omen was disappointing. It's an okay horror film compared to the huge mass of awful ones that exist. But it's deeply stupid with countless frustrating plot deficiencies. And it looks and feels old. But it's made reasonably well, takes its subject matter seriously and has a story that does become engaging. Perhaps it's best asset is its psychological boldness. It's pretty dark and it's a tough experience for the main characters. In that way, it is scary and memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Performances make this Movie seem Scarier than it is,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and a great cast. The film is considered a classic and a landmark of the horror genre, to me the thing that makes this is the acting, the performances offer the most thrills, you can really see and feel the fear from the actors, particularly Gregory Peck, one of the most talented actors who ever lived, here he delivers some stellar acting as a concerned and frightened father, and he stays as that throughout. To be entirely honest, the film never really does it for me as a horror, it really dosen't try to be as consistently scary as many people may think, there are long periods of time where the characters are simply talking, and once we do get to some exciting moments I simply feel let down from all the build up. The movie is also very far fetched which is why I wasn't particularly frightened, the idea of Satan coming to Earth and taking over the body of a child is bizarre, and it never tries to make this story seem real, there is no indication of the filmmakers trying to make its audience think they're watching something that could happen, and because of that I simply didn't feel scared. I'm sure many people think differently, but I find the Omen to be a boring, overrated horror that's big on acting but small on thrills, and I wouldn't recommend it. The Devil returns to Earth in the form of Damien, the son of an American diplomat. Best Performance: Gregory Peck</fullReview>

Plus, the remake doesn't bring any new cool stuff to the table, and while that was enough in the 70's, it's not any longer.When I see these old movies, I always partly try to imagine how it must have been to see them for the first time when they actually came out. The Omen was probably scary as all hell, back then. And while it definitely has some cool stuff in it, scared I was not. I'm sure it was also quite controversial, considering the subject matter and the young child playing Damien.I am always somewhat skeptical when I sit down to watch old "classics", because frankly, they tend to be a little boring. The Omen did entertain me, though. (I am on a quest to see all horror movies, so just wanting to have seen it, also comes into play)Anyway! The Omen is well made, has some effective scenes, a little bit of a creepy atmosphere (at least at times), the acting is good, and the story is pretty good. Personally I would like to see a lot more "action", as in more of Damiens doings. It would also have been a better experience had I not already seen the remake, because the story, and some of the plot points are pretty cool.Now I really want to see the sequels!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good morning. You are one day closer to the end of the world?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>?so went the end-times paranoia marketing campaign for 'The Omen'. Evidently the campaign, initiated months before the film's release, was a success as Warner Brothers' tale of an impeding apocalypse wrought upon the earth by the birth of The Antichrist as foretold in the Book of Revelations was a huge commercial hit and can still raise a shiver even today.In the movie Gregory Peck plays Robert Thorn, an American ambassador who is approached by a mysterious priest who offers him a baby boy when his pregnant wife suffers a stillborn delivery. Thorn accepts the boy and the family are then transferred to England where things are fine until five years later when disturbing events begin to occur which suggest that the ambassador's "son", Damien, is a chip off a much more sinister block. The ambassador is then tracked down by an eccentric priest blabbering about the end-of-the-world and Damien's role as The Antichrist. Initially dismissive, Thorn gradually comes to believe the priest's eschatological spiel when more people die and he discovers a birthmark on Damien's head in the shape of 666, the number of the beast, and decides to do what he can to avert the coming apocalypse.Following on from the Big Budget clout of earlier demonic problem-child horror 'The Exorcist' (1973), 'The Omen' seemed to take the lifeblood of its success from the deeply buried fear that there may actually be something in all of those un-listened to Sunday-school sermons drowning in the public's unconscious. With this lingering religious fear in the background, and accentuated by the ominous and Oscar winning score by Jerry Goldsmith, the hysterical atmosphere created by the film is enough to suspend even the most atheistic viewer's disbelief and remains my abiding impression of the film beyond any of the particularities of the plot. However, in saying this there is an implied criticism which makes the film merely "watchable" to "good" and nowhere near "great"; namely, while the film has atmosphere in spades and the kills are imaginative, the script hangs lifelessly off these good points and makes the film feel flabby and even dull at points.Perhaps, the reason for this is that whereas the two other films in the unholy trinity of demon-child horrors 'Rosemary's Baby' (1968) and 'The Exorcist' were both adapted from source novels, the genesis (pun intended) of 'The Omen' came from a realisation producer Harvey Bernhard had that the fundamentalist prophecies his born-again Christian friend would spout during conversations were in fact paranoid horror fantasies ideal for a movie. He then enlisted the help of screenwriter David Seltzer to flesh out the idea. However, in later years, Seltzer has been open about taking on the project solely due to needing money and maybe this absence of artistic commitment (so abundant in the other two films) is what explains the flabby through-line. As such, 'The Omen' lacks the Luciferian splendour of the 'Rosemary's Baby', and lacks the subtext of theological doubt that 'The Exorcist' author William Peter Blatty was wrestling with (although it shares the charge of Christian propaganda).So, while Damien would surely get a B- in his Satanic seminary, with his teacher despairing that he has potential but just isn't applying himself, it's still a pass grade higher than many others in the class.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good horror movie given that it's 38 years old. But there are plot-holes that does'nt make sense. There are six deaths in the movie. Two of them makes no sense. Mrs Baylock kills Thorns wife by throwing her out of a window at the hospital. How does Baylock get into her room unnoticed? How can she be strong enough to push another women through a window? How can she just leave the hospital after killing the wife? Where are the witnesses? When the priest is perforated on an iron pole, he has plenty of time to get out of harms way. Instead he just stands there and screams no until he is killed?? When Mrs Baylock disobeys to get Damian dressed for church, why is she not fired? When she does'nt get rid of the dog as she has been told to, why is she not fired? They clearly can't trust this woman who on top of that seems unstable and dangerous and yet they keep her around as a nanny. Why does'nt Thorn kill Damian at the house? Why take him to a church to kill him? Who or what was the woman that gave birth to Damian? This is never explained. Why does'nt Thorn ask to see his son who he is told was still born? Why does he just take the doctors word for it that his son is still born? In spite of good special effects for a movie this old these plot holes ruins the movie for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gregory Peck won't listen, and he pays the price</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As horror movies go, "The Omen" is one of the more meaningless ones with almost no intellectual or thematic appeal. Peck's character is so inclined not to heed what is told him that he virtually seals his fate and that of his wife, Lee Remick. He has been told to be saved by Christ. He doesn't listen the first time. All right. Write that off as being stubborn and haughty. But after learning about Damien, he still doesn't take this advice. Instead he wanders off doing needless detective work when he already has substantial information that warrants calling on the Holy Spirit.The plot has too many holes, such as Billie Whitelaw waltzing in to his house and taking over. Given the dark power's force that he has seen work against the first governess and his wife, you would think he might arm himself against contingencies, but he does not.Why, I'd like to know, were police so anxious to stop him at the end? I must have missed some critical plot point, or did I? There are some excellent horror movies out there, such as "Curse of the Demon", some of the Hammers, the old Universals, "White Zombie", Dr. X, and so on. In my opinion, "The Omen" is just average and doesn't come up to them. I think that it's missing some critical elements in the story. The acting, settings and direction here are adequate enough. I think it's the story where the weakness is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not at all horror movie, more on Family Drama genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Completed watching this much-acclaimed horror blockbuster yesterday night.It never looked to me as a horror movie. Instead of putting more horror element or gore/scary moments, this movie mostly dealt on Peck's emotional hesitance. The entire movie was kind of showcase of Peck's acting power and whoa! What a super actor he is!! But apart from his good acting, there is nothing in this movie which can glue the audience to the screen. The so-called scary moments are not at all scary. The dog was cute and the several dogs scene in old graveyard was pathetic. The killing moments were funny and ending was, well, kind of expected.So as a fan for horror genre, I am quite disappointed, but still it is not a trash for some good drama and acting.My rating 7 is mostly dedicated to Gregory Peck. Without him, I would give 2. At max.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm scared! The Devil will destroy the world!....err, 40 years from now.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine a flick with scientists &amp; military men running like headless chickens in their labs, bunkers, because an asteroid is coming our way and will strike us...in 2050. It that sends shivers down your spine, then TO may be the movie for you. There's one unwritten rule in film making--specially when it comes to horror or suspense flicks--concerning immediacy. It means you don't get in a fuss because of something that may happen or not 30, 40, years down the road. Fear, terror, anguish are things that only work short term. If we were told that somewhere in the world there is one 5-year old brat who'll destroy it, some day far in the future, we'd just roll in our beds and go back to sleep. Lack of urgency, I say. That's why TO doesn't work for me, why I watched it with complete detachment, from beginning to end. Not to mention all the pseudo-religious mumbo-jumbo of course.I gather TO was a product of the success of The Exorcist, as much as of its shortcomings?-by which I mean what others have argued before about why its monster would bother torturing a girl when he got the whole world at his disposal. So I guess, TO tries to make up for that; it tries to fill up the hole by going global. But in the process it loses the urgency that's crucial in an horror or suspense movie, which means that at the end it is about a couple and their child instead of a single mom and her kid. Big deal for a change.The best thing that can be said of TO is that it respects the viewer. This is a well done flick in many respects but not a great one in any. The cinematography's good, reaching heights of excellence in sequences such as the killing of F. Brennan &amp; the visit to the cemetery but with the decapitation providing rather for a cheap, voyeuristic low. The pace is sustained; it keeps you focused, except for a few dragged out scenes in the mansion. Soundtrack is appropriate, except for the male chorus, which I found out of place in an horror flick. Some say the atmosphere here is great but I can't relate to that. If you don't swallow the religious babble most likely you'll watch all with detachment. The acting is another weak point: Peck seems to be always playing the same somber, humorless, dutiful but utterly dull, man; one good for all seasons anyway. He looks the same before Kathy is killed and after that. As for Reemick, she plays here more a damsel in distress than a Mrs. Ambassador--Rose Kennedy would be the last name coming to you when seeing her. Whitelaw didn't impress me: all she did was to grimace and do evil stares. The dogs were Okay. But the best one is Warner, even if he constantly distracted me with his eerie resemblance to Gilligan?OK, maybe it's just me. But I had an even bigger problem trying to take the Forces of Evil (FOE) seriously.I disagree with the POV of these FOE being scary. They don't even rate high in my Smarts Scale, as they are sorely in need of putting their act together if they really want to destroy the world. The only reason why they prevail at the end is because the Thorns are even dumber. See, after the FOE make the nanny hang herself in such a shocking way, the couple should have been very careful at hiring her replacement. They should have interviewed dozens of applicants, inquired on every piece of information concerning weird habits, drug abuse, etc, which would have ruined the chances of FOE for "planting" an agent there. But what do they do instead? They accept without hesitation a total stranger, one who challenges their authority from the start, who even demands to be left alone with the kid! Wouldn't you say they had it coming? But the FOE don't fare better: they show their abysmal ignorance of even the basics, of something that even Argento knew and included in his clunkers: you kill those with important information BEFORE they open their mouths, no after. See for ex. how they kill Brennan AFTER he tells Thorn about Meggido and Bugenhagen. Later, why didn't they kill this last BEFORE he could give Thorn the knifes &amp; inform him of the ritual to kill Damien? Instead they kill Jennings, with the result of convincing a wavering Thorn that Damien was truly evil.But the whole FOE plan smacks of amateurism. They plant the Devil's son in an affluent family so he could use that power and influence to become a U.S. President and blow up the world. Well, I have news for you, FOE: the little guy won't find it easy to get up there. He'll have to work A LOT; he'll have to make campaigns, win primaries, raise funds, woo voters, and so on. So, at the end the whole thing looks just like a waste of time, when all what FOE had to do was to use the power it has, controlling the forces of Nature, to send us all to oblivion in a global fire, a monster tornado, whatever. That's why I don't find the flick a bit scary: its resident Devil are so dumb, they wouldn't know their way out of a kiddie's sandbox, Duh.So, just good enough to view once, for entertainment, which means 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror At Its Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ahh The Omen.. I have to say there are few horror movies that make me look over my shoulder while out on a dark night but this is one of them. It's just so damn creepy! How is it that a Hollywood movie directed by the same guy who brought us Superman can touch such a raw nerve? Having given this a lot of thought I have come to the conclusion that it's the overall feeling of impending doom that really chills us to the bone. We the audience are in on the plot. We know who Damien is. We also know that anyone who discovers the little cherub's secret is in serious trouble. From the moment they suspect something is up they are doomed to a grizzly random death.All we can do is sit and helplessly watch as they meet their hapless end? Add to this the utterly evil portrayal of the Nanny by Billie Whitelaw which is excellent. Polite but obstructive, protective to the point of sinister and ultimately a maniac with a kitchen knife she's utterly convincing. Towards the end of the film you get the impression that the nursery has become a sort of inner sanctum which Damien rarely leaves. Just crossing into the room feels threatening.The other thing that makes The Omen so much fun is the adventure of discovery that Gregory Peck and David Warner go on. Having set up the "once you know you're dead" premise we then are kept on the edge of our seats as the guys travel to Italy and Israel to discover each element of Damien's heritage. We feel that evil is snapping at their heels every step of the way (literally in the grave yard scene)! Having teetered on the edge of your seat for the last hour and a half, Donner and crew take us to breaking point as Peck returns to his home, hell bent on killing the impostor child that's destroyed his family. Jerry Goldsmiths score pounds your ears as Peck drags Damien up the church aisle toward the alter intending to send him back to the hell from which he came? and you're rooting for him all the way! Will he succeed? Won't he? Come on! Come on! It's a fantastic movie experience and if you haven't seen it you've sorely missed out on a movie classic...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Number of the Beast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The number 666 (the so-called "Number of the Beast") has traditionally been associated with all things diabolical, so I thought this film would be a suitable subject for my 666th review for IMDb.At one time supernatural horror films normally dealt with assorted monsters, vampires, ghosts and things that go bump in the night, but in the sixties and seventies the fashion arose for what might be called the theological horror film, dealing with such matters as Satanism, demonic possession and the end of the world. "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Exorcist" are films of this type, and "The Omen" is another in the same tradition.The central character, Robert Thorn, is very much a part of the American establishment- scion of a wealthy old-money family, a close friend of the President and his country's Ambassador to Italy. While they are living in Rome, Robert's wife Katherine gives birth to a stillborn child, and he is persuaded to adopt a baby born on the same night in the same hospital, and whose mother died in childbirth. They name the child Damien, a name presumably chosen because of its closeness to "demon". Soon afterwards Thorn is appointed US Ambassador to Great Britain- Italian viewers may not be pleased to note that in the movie this is regarded as a promotion- and moves with Katherine and young Damien to London.As Damien grows up, however, he becomes the focus of a series of strange and unsettling events, including the suicide of his nanny at his fifth birthday party. Thorn is warned by a priest that his adopted son is in fact the Antichrist, the son of Satan himself. At first he dismisses the man's warnings as the ravings of a lunatic, but later begins to suspect that there may be some truth in them, especially after the priest dies in a bizarre accident. Desperate to find out the truth, Thorn visits Rome and Israel with a photographer named Keith Jennings and realises that Damien is indeed the Antichrist.From a technical point of view, the film is well-made. This was Richard Donner's first major film and he showed the abilities he was later to bring to other action films such as "Superman" and the "Lethal Weapon" series. The action sequences are well handled and contribute to a growing sense of tension; only occasionally, as in the scene where Jennings is decapitated in a freak accident, do the rather primitive seventies special effects show through. This scene was clearly intended to be horrific, but today it comes across as inadvertently comic. The look of the film is dull and autumnal, regardless of the ostensible time of year, with a muted colour scheme, and this adds to its sinister atmosphere, as does Jerry Goldsmith's musical score.Gregory Peck was not the first choice to play Thorn- the producers originally wanted Charlton Heston in the role- but he plays it so well that one cannot imagine any other actor in the part. Thorn is similar to some other Peck characters, such as Atticus Finch in "To Kill a Mockingbird" and Sam Bowden in "Cape Fear" in that he is a decent, liberal man suddenly confronted with the problem of evil, except that Thorn is confronted with evil in its purest form and with a dilemma- whether or not to kill his adopted son- even more stark than anything which confronted Finch or Bowden. There is another very good performance from Billie Whitelaw as the sinister Mrs Blaylock, who becomes Damien's new nanny after the suicide of her predecessor and quickly becomes his guardian angel. Or rather his guardian devil, as she is a servant of Satan sent to protect the boy form harm.My reservations about this film are largely theological. My own religious position is a liberal one, and although I believe in the existence of God I do not believe in the literal existence of the Devil who is, at most, a representation in symbolic form of man's capacity for evil, not some sort of rival god. I am normally prepared to suspend my scepticism about supernatural phenomena in the interests of good entertainment; I have never, for example, allowed the fact that I do not believe in witchcraft to spoil my enjoyment of the Harry Potter films. I tend, however, to make an exception in the case of films which ask me to accept the literal existence of Satan, or which preach that the end of the world is nigh, and there is a reason for this.A literalistic interpretation of the Book of Revelation as a prophecy of a coming Armageddon has always struck me as a hallmark of the most reactionary and intolerant sort of Christianity, the sort which is always more ready to hate one's enemies than to forgive them and which finds it easy to identify the Antichrist with whichever enemy (the Pope, Muslims, the United Nations, whoever) is at the top of that particular sect's hate-list. I doubt if the makers of this film made it with the explicit purpose of furthering a Christian fundamentalist agenda; a much more likely motive was to emulate the financial success of "The Exorcist", which had been one of the biggest films of 1973. Nevertheless, I feel that that is the sort of agenda which this film, and others like it, may well inadvertently further. 6/10</fullReview>

Don't get me wrong, it definitely wasn't a bad movie. I just felt it was hard to follow the storyline. The storyline was great however. All the actors were good as well. The only one I wasn't too fond of was Ms. Baylock. But thats just my opinion. There were some very unique kills as well. Ones you won't find in any old basic slasher movie. Also, Robert THorn and Keith Jennings were 2 very convincing characters. Father Brennan was also genuinely creepy and a little shady, but it all worked well with the actors who played the parts. I give this a 6(66)/10. Didn't overly thrill me, but was original and still a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Donner directed a great-- why am I not surprised? The man behind "Superman," "Ladyhawke," and "Scrooged" earlier brought his genius into play with this satanic and bone-chilling horror film, the granddaddy of them all.Harvey Stephens gives a terrifying and nearly silent performance as Damien, a little boy with piercing eyes adopted by an ambitious American ambassador (Gregory Peck). Is little Damien the Antichrist? Join Peck on a journey to discover just that-- a journey that includes fantastic performances from Lee Remick, David Warner, and, in the eeriest role in the whole movie, Billie Whitelaw (Aughra from "The Dark Crystal").But the performances aren't the half of it. That bloodcurdling "Ave Satani" shows up frequently during the movie (it is the film's most shocking feature), complementing Jerry Goldsmith's instrumental score. Cinematographer Gilbert Taylor ("Dr. Strangelove," "Star Wars") doesn't dare disappoint. And the film's grisly death scenes are not of the low quality you'd expect-- there's actually reasoning behind each one of them.If you're looking for the best religious horror film ever made, you can go wrong with neither this nor "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" (which, I suppose, is a little more of a courtroom drama). And its number? 666.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After an American diplomat's son dies shortly after birth, he agrees to adopt an orphaned child, leaving his wife to believe that the substitute boy, Damien, is really her own. In reality, Damien is the AntiChrist, born of a jackal and deliberately placed with an influential family by Satan's acolytes in order for him to eventually become a powerful world leader.Richard Donner's superb Satanic horror classic is a thrilling, suspenseful and thoroughly absorbing tale, based on the end times prophecies of Christianity, as found in the Book of Revelation. A major studio film, with a brilliant cast, marvellous script, and an amazing Oscar-winning score by Jerry Goldsmith, The Omen is a movie that demands to be seen by all fans of the horror genre.Gregory Peck plays Robert Thorn, the poor sucker who is tricked into taking Damien into his home; Lee Remick is his wife who begins to suspect that the boy is not really hers. After Damien's nanny commits suicide (to be conveniently replaced by nasty Satanist, Mrs. Baylock, played perfectly by Billie Whitelaw), and Father Brennan (Patrick Troughton), a priest who tries to warn the diplomat that his son is the devil's offspring, dies in a gruesome freak accident, Thorn is contacted by Keith Jennings (David Warner), a photographer who has been investigating the bizarre events that have been occurring.Together, Thorn and Jennings delve deeper into the mystery and discover the shocking truth, and realise that the only way to end the horror is to ritually kill the evil child using seven special ceremonial daggers.With a subject matter that could easily have ended up as unintentionally funny in the hands of a lesser director, The Omen manages to be extremely creepy, very atmospheric and often very shocking. There are many standout macabre moments in the film, including Damien's refusal to enter a cathedral, a baboon attack at Windsor Safari Park and the oft-mentioned slow motion beheading scene, but it is Thorn and Jenning's visit to an ancient Etruscan cemetery that is the highpoint of the movie for me: after the heartbreaking discovery that Thorn's real son was actually murdered, we are treated to a great scene in which several dogs launch a vicious attack on the two men.Turn off the lights, light a few candles, crank up the sound (to make the most of the foreboding choral score), and have a devil of a time watching one of the best horror movies of all time.</fullReview>

One of the scariest and most unnerving occult horror films ever made about Satan.

Director Richard Donner layers the moments of truly gnarly gruesome killings (Warner's doomed photographer is destined as one of the best on screen offings and thanks to the miracle of stop-frame &amp; rewind you'll be thrilled to know it's really gross and truly unsettling) and the bone-chilling score by composing vet Jerry Goldsmith copped a richly deserved Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining horror movie, albeit somewhat dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard ("Lethal Weapon"/"Superman") Donner's THE OMEN is one of the most literate horror movies ever made, and to its credit the recent remake was an equally classy affair, an almost scene-for-scene replay that used large dollops of David Seltzer's original dialog. In the original, Gregory Peck and Lee Remick play an ambassdor and his wife living abroad who have a child who turns out to be not all that he's cracked up to be. People start dying around the tyke, and it slowly dawns on Peck and Remick that the kid is not exactly human. This unusually intelligent son-of-Satan potboiler has all the requisites of a '70s horror flick, including a plethora of violent deaths and several ominous moments. It also has, in Peck and Remick, along with David Warner as a suspicious photographer and Billie Whitelaw as the kid's sinister nanny, the best cast ever to grace a horror flick. This elevated THE OMEN to "A" status. Now, as to the film's faults: satanic plots are not to everyone's taste, and they can quickly get boring, so the audience for this will be limited. It's not like watching JAWS or Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE or NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD or HALLOWEEN. The '70s photography. film stock and certain uncorrected sound sequences are badly dated by today's standards. And I hate to say it, but Peck and Remick are way too old to be the parents of this infernal baby. Fact is, they were old enough to play the kid's grandparents. This unfortunate situation was corrected in the remake with the casting of the much more youthful Liev Schreiber and Julia Styles in the Peck and Remick roles. I also must admit I have never been a big fan of satanic movies, so kudos to master director Donner for keeping me awake through most of this mini-masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Devil's Apprentice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers) After the 1973 release of the devilishly inspired movie "The Exorcist" scores of films about the Devil were cranked out of the movie studios in Hollywood and overseas to take advantage, in their box office sales, of that ground-breaking horror classic. It wasn't until three later in 1976 that a movie came along that not only matched "The Exorcist" in sheer Satanic inspired terror but actually eclipsed it in it's storyline The movie has the Devil comes back on earth to usher in the End of Times that would effect the entire human race not just the little 12 year-old girl that the Devil possessed and took control of in that 1973 block-buster.Rushing to a Catholic Church run hospital in Rome where his wife Katie, Lee Remick, was about to give birth US diplomat Robert Thorn, Gregory Peck, is told by one of the men involved in Katie's hospitalization and delivery Father Spiletto, Martin Benson, that his and Katie's son was born dead. A shocked and heart-broken Robert is then told that his and Katie's dead son was replaced with a newborn baby boy who was born with his mother dying in childbirth. Robert knowing that Katie always wanted to have a child and that the news that her baby was delivered stillborn, and that she'll never be able to have children again, would kill her goes along with Father Spiletto and keeps the truth from Katie. The time of the Thorns adopted sons birth was recorded in the hospital at exactly 6:06AM Rome time the date was June the sixth or 6/06 and the Thorns named their son Damien, Harvey Stephens,With Robert later appointed to be the Ambassador to the Court of Saint James, Great Britain, things couldn't have been better for him and his wife and young son. Suddenly at Damien's fifth birthday party strange things began to happen that lead Robert to later believe, as the evidence piled up to the point where he could no longer ignore it, that whoever his sons real parents were they weren't human and even more shocking not of this earth!All this weirdness starts with Damien's nanny, Holly Palance, jumping to her death at his fifth birthday party, with a rope tied around her neck. Strange tings continue to happen with Damien exhibiting such subconscious terror that when taken to a local zoo with his mom the animals go completely berserk with fear at the very sight of the young boy. Robert is later contacted by a catholic priest Father Brenner, Patrick Thoughton, who claimed that he was at the hospital the night that Damien was born. Robert is told that Damien's birth mother was not a human being and his father was non-other then the Devil himself! In short Damien is the Beast predicted in the Bible to bring about the end of the world, and human race, in the climatic engagement between Good and Evil thats so frightfully described in the battle of Armageddon. What even more convinced Robert about Damien's dark background was when Father Brenner was killed, just after he got in contact with him about the truth of Damien's strange and demonic powers. Father Brenner's impending death was predicted by a number of photos of him taken by free-lance photographer Keith Jennings ,David Warner,that indicated,like they had with the deceased Damien's nanny, that he was somehow marked for death!Damien in the meantime was being protected from harm and exposer of his identity by his new nanny Mrs. Baylock, Billie Whitelaw, a fanatical crypto-Satanist and this vicious large and sentry-like Devil Dog that Robert, who was very intimidated by, seemed to have to way of keeping out of the house!Following up a number of clues to Damien's true identify both Robert and Jennings go to the cemetery where Damien's true mother is buried. The two are shocked to find, like what Father Brenner told Robert, that Damien's mother wasn't human! Just as Robert and Jennings are about to leave a number of wild Devil Dogs, much like the one protecting Damien, suddenly appear out of nowhere attacking and driving both of them out of the grave yard and surviving from being torn to pieces by climbing over the cemetery's iron fence.Robert and Jennins go to the Holy Land in Israel at an excavation site outside of Jerusalem's to see archaeologist Carl Bugenhagen, Leo McKern, about the true reason behind Damien's connection to the Thorns. Bugenhagen after confirming Roberts darkest fears gives him a number of knives that will put an end to Damien and the nightmare he's creating.Robert is again shocked down to his socks and soul when Jennings who tells him that he would eventually suffer an untimely and sudden death from a photo indicating it that he took of himself! Sure enough Jennings is later decapitated in a freak accident in the Holy City. Now almost a firm believer in that Damien is in fact the Antichrist of the book of Revelation Robert has one and only one doubt left to overcome and that's the Devil's mark, the number 666, that's to reveal Damien's true and horrifying identity. Coming home to the US Ambassadors residence outside of London Robert finds the "mark" secretly hidden under Damien's hair where he's suddenly and ferociously attacked from behind by Mrs. Baylock. The movie quickly moves to it's final and almost unwatchable and, in the case of whats expected of Robert Thorn to do, unbearable ending!Superior horror film that hasn't aged one bit since it's released thirty years ago with a really unique and unnerving soundtrack that's effectively used throughout the film, as well as in the opening and closing credits. A both original and eerie Latin Satanic Chant entitled "Hail Satan"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, but has many boring moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard of it, but was never really intrigued enough to go out and watch The Omen. But when the remake was announced, I became interested, and even more so as the mythical 6/6/06 day was arriving. So in special "celebration" (not the right word, I know) of that day, I purchased up the original and watched it. While I was not terribly disappointed, I was not entirely impressed either.Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) is an American Ambassador in Italy, whose wife Katherine (Lee Remick) has given birth to a stillborn baby, on June 6 at 6 A.M.. For the sake of his wife, Robert goes to an orphanage and adopts a new born child, who he brings to his wife, without ever telling her of the tragic death. They name him Damien, and soon after, the Thorns are moved to Britain. As Damien's fifth birthday comes though, a bizarre death occurs at his party, and even stranger things begin to happen soon afterwards, leading Robert to start believing that his son may be the Anti-Christ.While the film is not particularly scary, it is fairly tense. As the film goes along and the death toll rises, you cannot help but start believing what is going on is much more real than it may seem. Just the idea of the devil being born again in the body of a child is terrifying enough. And as a result, Richard Donner's production performs well, even thirty years later. David Seltzer's screenplay is well versed and well written. Even though you can predict what's coming, the writing is still very well done and well communicated. Jerry Goldsmith's score holds up well, if a little more dramatic than it should be.Peck is great as Robert, always questioning, and never truly knowing the truth. When emotional moments come however, his acting is not as reciprocal as it should be. But this is a great actor here, and he handles the material well, and never really messes it up. Remick is not bad, but falls to the wayside about halfway through, in order for Robert's investigation to really take hold of the film. David Warner does a great supporting turn as the photographer Keith Jennings, and for his short role, Patrick Troughton does great as Father Brennan.If I was disappointed at all with the cast, it would be the fact that Harvey Stephens' Damien and Billie Whitelaw's much discussed Mrs. Baylock are barely in the film. These are two of the creepiest characters in the horror/suspense genre, and they barely have any chances to show why. Of course, when they are on screen, they are fabulous, but those moments only come so few and far between the main story.If the film has anything wrong with it, it's the fact that there is so much in it, that it feels overly long (even at one hundred and eleven minutes). The film is totally interesting for the first half, but begins to get bogged down by a ton of exposition by the beginning of the second half. It drags out, and what should feel really shocking, really feels boring. Yes, the many moments that are supposed to strike us as horrific, do strike us that way. But the time that the film takes to get to it's eventual conclusion is really long. And even with the exposition, there are still way too questionable moments that are left unanswered.The film holds up and is very well made, but it could have used a bit of extra editing. The entire thing is very interesting, but some may get turned off by how strikingly boring the film becomes. I could only wish there was much more of Mrs. Baylock and Damien in the film too.7.5/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I really hope they don't mess this one up with the remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing that horror movies often lack is the "believe" factor. The Omen (1976) manages to embody a tone of believability while still submerging its audinece into a completely outlandish scenario. Capitalizing on its mainly Judeo-Christian audience's religious beliefs, the Omen does a wonderful job of terrifying its viewers with a subtle build to the most unimaginable and truly horrific outcomes. The most upsetting part of this movie not the moments that break into the extreme or absurd, but rather all the linking moments of normalcy that link them. For instance, the chilling common of a child's birthday interrupted by the sudden suicide of a possessed nanny. It makes for an unsteady ride on a sea of comfort with spurt of conflict. I loved it. We'll see if Julie Stiles can live up to Lee Remnick's amazing Katherine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scariest movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 21 when I first saw this movie 30 years ago. To this day, it is the most frightening movie I have ever seen. While there are a lot of gory movies out there, this was terrifying because it was based on Revelation from the the Bible. I had nightmares and couldn't sleep for WEEKS after seeing The Omen. I can't believe they have made a second one which I will NOT see.It starts out innocently enough with the father wanting to spare his wife pain after their newborn son dies. He substitutes a newborn baby in his child's place when a priest at the hospital suggests it. It is only later that Mr. Thorn find out the mother was a jackal and the father is Satan himself. Things get interesting as they search for the truth and downright petrifying as they find the truth. Although there were some very memorable death scenes, it wasn't gory, just unnerving.If you like edge of your seat type movies and aren't prone to nightmares or panic attacks, when you will enjoy this movie. Otherwise watch it during the day and then put on a good comedy afterward if you want to sleep that night..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know this movie is old and all but I love it. Damein is such an evil little cutie. You would never think that a sweet looking little boy would be the spawn of Satan. But hey looks are deceiving. Anyways this is how horror movies should be. Not the lame poor excuse ones like the newer Amittyville Horror, which personally I found very lame. I love this movie and all the other Omens. Also because of this movie and the much to me comedy "The Exorcist" many other people have tried making other Satanic related films, which turned out to be total flops. But if you looking for a mild fright "The Omen" is the movie for you. You should also try looking into the other films. Howerver I was disappointed with the third or was it the fourth one. Either way one of the two was highly disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about this classic movie that hasn't been said before? Well, in case you're a.too lazy to go to a plot summary and b.been living under a rock for 30 years, this movie is about a young boy named Damien who is suspected of being the Antichrist by several people, all of whom soon die in freakish accidents. One highlight would be the priest being impaled on a steeple during a storm. This scene has no gore, but is still effective. The gore in this movie is very little. About the goriest it gets is a photographer being decapitated and the mom being shoved out a window. The acting in this movie is superb. Gregory Peck is a very good actor. Sadly he and Lee Remick, a great actress and his costar, are now dead. The young boy playing Damien does a fair job in this movie. The actress playing Mrs. Baylock does a very good job of being psycho, no more and no less. This movie is one of the scariest movies I've seen. If you like horror movies, you simply cannot miss this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And he shall come as a little child</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let him who is wise discern the number of the beast it is a mans number The number is 666In case you have never seen the movie here is a brief summary. An American politician,Gregory Peck,adopts a child Damien, but as he grows up it becomes apparent that he is not all that he seems to be. in my opinion this movie ,even though 30 years old,is still one of the creepiest films i have ever seen. To begin with the eerie religious music gives the film a starting block as it helps to build the tension and strangely enough gives the viewer a sense of evil. Second of all you watch this film with the sense that the good guys just cannot win and that ultimately evil will triumph. The little boy is certainly very creepy but is supported by an outstanding cast.Gregory Peck and Lee Remick are excellent as Damiens foster parents who are drawn into something they cannot understand,David Warner is also good as a photographer who senses ,thru his photos,that evil is in the air, but the most chilling supporting character is the creepy nanny who has sworn to protect the child . She is played superbly by Billie Whitelaw and i think that she is probably the most chilling and disturbing character in the film. I cant see much wrong with this film.The direction is fast and basically non-stop,you really don't get a chance to breathe and the deaths are not overly graphic but just graphic enough to hold your interest. What makes this film verge on the border of sheer brilliance is during the funeral at the end when the final shot pans to the back of Damien's face and he turns and smiles.Even though i have seen this film many times i still get goose bumps at the end and i personally think it is the creepiest smile in the history of the cinema. My score for this horror masterpiece can only be 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The omen is a good movie, even today. Although I knew kind of what was going to happen(I've read the hilarious book "Good Omens") and the score of the film had been ripped off by a not-so-serious horror comedy, I still enjoyed the movie.There are many factors why. First of all, the child actor portraying Damien is excellent. He's much like a normal child, but with an edge. Some scenes are still shocking, even to a jaded viewer like me. The grown-ups do a good job as well, from Peck as the stiff, unbelieving ambassador to the worried mother who believes her child is evil.The plot is good, the death scenes are very imaginative, and Jerry Goldsmith's score is great. This is a great movie for a late night when you want to be just a little bit scared. Even if it has dated a bit, the mood in the movie is so far unrivaled by today's horror.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My dad told me that The Omen is to be remade, (it will be called The Omen 666). Why? It is a fantastic movie. It is because nobody can come up with any decent ideas nowadays so that have to rehash great films from the past. Everywhere you turn there is either a TV show being made into a movie, some rubbish sequel being churned out or a film just being remade entirely. (On IMDb.com I did notice there are 3 Omen sequels already). If they remake The Omen with heaps of blood and gore and stupid over the top deaths I will be so mad! I'll go on a grape squashing, tissue tearing frenzied rampage. They'll probably have some American kid in it too that talks a lot. Julia Stiles is to play Damien's mother - isn't she only about 24? Goodness! The Omen is fantastic - it has a good storyline, it is scary and creepy without the use of chainsaws, knives, blood or chase scenes. Damien is also great - the scene where he goes psycho in the car is very well done. I also love his clothes (being made in the seventies there are quite a few pairs of mini flares). Mrs Baylock, Damien's nanny is like a nightmarish Mary Poppins. It is a long film but there's a lot of story to fit in so it has to be. Another great scene is the tricycle scene. It is simple yet effective, what a horrible boy we all think, yet it also looks like an accident because he was just so into riding his trike. Is he really evil or was it just Mrs Baylock's fault? Ooooh! The goldfish falling is also a nice touch. (I read recently that Harvey Stephens who played Damien still has the tricycle.) I enjoy this film every time I see it, it is a classic with a capital C.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best devil movie ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget the overrated "Exorcist"...this movie takes the cake as far as demonic movies go. Almost 30 years later it still holds up.This movie has so many things elevating it above the typical genre fare. The acting is excellent by all, featuring some of the best performances ever in a film of this type. Richard Donner's direction is low key and subtle, which was the best way to go about a movie like this, because if you overdo it, it just comes off cheesy. And admittedly the plot DOES sound hokey...a couple finding out their son is the Antichrist could be the start of a really hokey picture, but Donner plays the material just right. Nothing is overblown and there are none of the corny contraptions you might expect in a movie like this, such as red eyes, demons, gross special effects, etc. Rather, the story plays out more like a psychological drama with a horror element. And perhaps that's why it works so well.Jerry Goldsmith's score for this film is legendary by now...simply one of the best horror film scores (or any film score, really) of all time. The score almost makes the movie itself, it's so effective and chilling. From the moment you hear "Ave Satani" over the opening credits, you know you're in for a ride.The death scenes are some of the most memorable ever to be captured on film. Not because of the gore element (there's actually very little) but for the bizarre situations surrounding all of them. One character, in one of the movie's most memorable scenes, gets decapitated by a sheet of glass that slides out the back of a runaway truck.I could gush about this movie for hours, but I'll keep it short and just say that if you haven't seen it, do yourself a big favor and pick this little classic up. It's too bad this little gem is overshadowed by the almighty "Exorcist" because it is, in my opinion, a much more effective and frightening film. Had it come out BEFORE "The Exorcist" I daresay things might have been different, but I guess we'll never know.If you want a truly scary movie that will stick with you for days, this is it. It raises questions about faith, life, and morality while still managing to get under your skin and creep the hell out of you. It also raises questions that don't go away after the film ends. It takes a special movie to do that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is amazing. Lee Remick was amazing and gorgeous as usual. This is different from all horror films. Greggory Peck was great but a bit too serious with his famous line, "Kathy I love you". Some parts make you laugh, some cry, some scream. It is one of those movies that don't try to scare you but just give you the creeps. I highly recommend to keep the lights on while watching this one. Damien is quite adorable but don't be fooled by him. The baboon scene is a classic for those of you who have seen it. This is supposed to be one of the scariest movies of all time. I like that nothing jumps out at you at all. Lee and Greggory are a very convincing couple. By wathcing them they make you believe what you are watching is very real and is happening. They are a match made in heaven. Mrs. Baylock (Billie Whitelaw) was outstanding and very chilling. She always gave me goosebumps when I saw her. All in all the movie is a great classic. If you love horror films then this is a must see!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Provides some chills and effects, but is pretty over-rated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard so much about this movie that it was scary, chilling. But when the credits rolled up, I sat there almost un-effected by anything that The Omen offered. I suddenly realised that although chilling in the littlest aspect, it is an old, over-rated horror flick. PLOT: Gregory Peck i a buisnessman who is being told that his young son Damien (acted well) may be the anti-christ. Peck doesn't buy it untill people around him begin to die strange deaths. Peck is not convincing in his role as a father who suspects absolutely NOTHING, even though there are all these things happening in his world. Like I mentioned arlier the kid who played Damien is probobly the highlight of this near two-hour ride that includes: sometimes cheesy and lousy acting acting (some of the lousiness coming from Peck), pretty good special effects, and unbelievable characters (especially Peck, mr. heart-of-gold-i-don't-suspect-a-thing). this isn't the greatest horror movie, if you're interested in supernatural horror instead of the psycho slasher types, rent The Exorsist.The Omen scores 5.5/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic horror film. That's The Omen. Starring Gregory Peck (what a great actor) you discover a sane and intelligent man who loves life and loves his family. You soon identify with him, and then is when the circumstances start to change the way he sees the world. Desperately slowly (we as the audience know the truth) he finds himself deeper and deeper into a hole from which there is no escape. Finally, he loses all the emotional links he had with life and escapes by the only exit available from his destiny pit: To eliminate the origin of all that horror that has destroyed his life. At the end of the film he is still a sceptic man, but he's no longer sane. As a final act, he won't kill his own son to save the world. It's just a personal revenge against the evil. And the evil is stronger. So the result was yet written from the beginning. That's the most shocking aspect I find in this film. No matter what the world would do the destiny would always be the same...Gregory Peck's performance is outstanding. He does a really good job. Without him this film wouldn't have been the same. The music is marvelous (did I say that John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith are my favorite ones?), and the cinematography and editing are simply perfect. I specially like that scene at the beginning after he reveals to his wife he's been nominated ambassador in London. Instantly it changes to a dynamic scene where they are crossing London's streets in a Rolls. That scene is cinematographic art by excellence. The wide angle images and the music are prodigiously melt.Also, the child is quite good. You see him learning from life, but from the dark side of life. You feel his innocence and, as his father, you feel sorry for him.All in all, this is one of the greatest horror films ever made.8-9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty silly but still watchable and high on the "cool factor"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is about a couple (Gregory Peck and Lee Remick) whose child dies at childbirth and is replaced by the son of Satan (wow, that's a bummer). As the little lad grows, weird things happen and a couple weird people come into his life that would indicate he isn't quite the sweet little angel he appears to be. But, naturally, his parents can't believe their child is THAT bad--after all, how many parents have been INCORRECTLY told that their children are sons of Satan? I'm a school teacher, so trust me that it does happen and happens quite a lot!! Well, because the child is Beelzebub, Jr., when Peck finally is forced to acknowledge that the kid is evil, it's not surprising that all hell breaks loose--leading to a thrilling finale.This film is featured in the wonderful book "The Fifty Worst Films of All Time" by Harry Medved. And while I generally agree with his picks, there were a few films listed that seemed more like "guilty pleasures" or "cult films" instead of truly bad films. Sure, this is NOT one of the better films of the 1970s, as in places it all seemed awfully silly and over-done, but STILL it is pretty watchable because on a superficial level it is pretty cool. Now a thinking and overly critical viewer will notice all the silly religious mumbo-jumbo, so I advise you to turn off your brain when you watch the film and just accept it for what it is--a relatively high-budget and silly horror film that won't change your life. Sure, at times it all seems very histrionic but do we always have to watch intelligent or thought-provoking films? So, the next time you want some silly eye candy, try this film--it's not all that bad and will most certainly keep your attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your average horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first popped this movie into my DVD player I was worried it would be one of those plot less, pointless horror flicks we've been seeing more and more of lately. You know, the movies where instead of putting any real scares in they just make it really gory and the only suspense is wondering which death will have the most blood. Believe me this is not the case.Let me begin by saying the plot in this story is solid and there are no plot holes (as far as I can see anyway).The pure concept of the movie is bone chilling. The devil is a concept that has scared even the most brave people for decades. Well, okay, that's all fine and dandy but how about we put the terrible power, and pure evil of the devil into a small and seemingly harmless child. Oy.The suspense at times (if you're in the right frame of mind anyway)will tear at your nerves and have you on the edge of your seat the whole movie.The music is just........... Unbelievable, and the acting is superb.Even though this movie isn't exactly scary (keep in mind that this is coming from a girl who has seen tons of horror flicks and hasn't been scared by a single one) it is most certainly my favorite movie of all time. I recommend this for any horror flick fan who likes to watch well thought out horror flicks instead of the plot less, pointless ones. However if you like the plot less, pointless gory movies you may like this but I highly doubt it.So rent (or better yet buy) this movie, pop it into your DVD player, dim the lights, and let the horror begin!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning : Some things written directly below this can be seen as SPOILERS !!!The Omen is a great movie about the best and scariest possible topic ever. This movie really proves that horror is the most powerful genre in cinema...it contains the creepiest thriller moments and a good amount of touching drama. A horror role model and one of the better efforts in the genre ever. Made in 1976, The Omen had several groundbreaking aspects and it still stands after more than 25 years. Like its even more famous "predecessor" ( sort of ),The Exorcist uses the Christian Religion as a basic plot. If you add a few sensitive side aspects to that like child death, armageddon and politics I assure you'll be pinned to your screen for a good 110 minutes. Gregory Peck, although normally not a routine horror actor, gives away a terrific performance as Robert Thorn. He's an American ambassador who can't manage to tell his wife ( a good Lee Remick ) that their son died while giving birth. He accepts to adopt an orphan that was born on the same day and he decides never to tell his wife. When the boy - Damien - turns five, he's going through some...euh...changes ! It seems that Damien is the unmitigated Antichrist. The son of Satan himself, sent to the earth on 6am on the 6th day of the 6th month, to take over the world and to annihilate every quoin of the Christian belief. When it comes to atmosphere and tension, The Omen satisfies the most critic horror fan. The story develops itself like a sort of mystery that needs to be revealed. It's filled with surprises since you get the idea that nobody is safe in The Omen...You fear that every character can die at every moment and that fascinates you so much...The film isn't very bloody but that certainly doesn't bother you. The tension of it overrules the most beautiful gory scenes. And I have to mention the great use of music. I admit I am a sucker for loud, biblical and opera-like sounding music but I can't believe that someone is left cold with this music. The score leads in some of the most breath-taking scenes I've ever seen. Overall, The Omen is a must see and not strictly for horror fans. The whole myth about the Antichrist and his birthmark - IF it is a myth of course...- is one of the best stories ever written. Favorite "rewind"-scenes : If can't decide between these two so I'll add them both to this review...The first one is at Damien's birthday party. The party gets brutally interrupted by the nanny.

		<shortDescription>It was better when I was sixteen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming on the heels of "The Exorcist" probably helped this movie get made. It made piles of money and spawned several unnecessary sequels. It was a classy production with reputable stars (Gregory Peck and Lee Remick), and dependable co-stars are a sinister Nanny (Billie Whitelaw), and the venerable David Warner. The movie is satisfyingly evil and scary but several scenes fall flat - Peck and Whitelaw's knockdown fight, in particular, should have been much better staged. The whole thing is wrapped in a loud but effective Oscar-winning score by Jerry Goldsmith, which is perhaps the most memorable thing here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It turns out that the child an American ambassador replaced his stillborn with is the Antichrist, complete with "666" stamped on his head. The filmmakers take this nonsense much too seriously. It may have worked better as a black comedy. The script follows no logic. Donner goes for cheap thrills at every opportunity, but what are supposed to be the big scary moments are poorly executed and not the least bit scary. Peck manages to keep a straight face through all the silliness, but at age 60, was a bit long in the tooth to be believable as a first-time father. Remick, 20 years younger than Peck but still old for a first-time mother, isn't given much to do except look helpless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Troughton's lunatic priest covers his walls in newspaper cuttings?Howe come? Surely even on a priests salary he could have afforded to buy new wallpaper like the rest of us. It is not THAT expensive.Was he a miser? It is never fully explained why he did not simply buy some new wallpaper.The guy wasn't very smart. Why did he make more work for himself by plastering newspaper CUTTINGS over his walls when using the whole sheet would have covered more space?This aside, the rest of the movie was reasonably entertaining.However, I do not understand why Gregory Peck's character does not help the photographer when he is decapitated. Peck just stands there watching. Selfish. He should have helped the photographer or at least called an ambulance instead of simply turning away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the scariest movie made before 1981. It has great acting. It also has a great story line. It also has great special effects. It one of the scariest movies from the 70's. 7.6 is overrating it just a little. It is good but it is not that good. I have it 5 out of 10. Omen III The final conflict is better. This movie is a must see. It is a true of classic there is a lot of hype about this movie. Exorcist II is better. But still this a great movie. Scarier then Silence of the lambs could ever be. It is very intense. Gregory Peck was a great actor. Harvey Stephens is a great actor. Richard Donner is a great film maker. This movie is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite scary movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of my favorite scary movies. I first saw it in 1997 when I acquired it on VHS. I now have it on DVD as well. In it Gregory Peck portrays an ambassador whose wife suffers a stillbirth. He agrees to claim a healthy newborn as the couple's own child. All seems normal until the child named Damien turns 5 and his first nanny hangs herself in the midst of the 5th birthday party for him. A priest warns the ambassador that young Damien is the Antichrist. Gregory Peck's performance as the ambassador had a gravitas that he brought to all his performances. Lee Remick was effective as his wife. Harvey Stephens is particularly creepy as Damien. The major supporting cast is excellent. If you're in the mood to be creeped out catch this movie.</fullReview>

It's simply psychological, which makes it great.Damien (Harvey Stephens) and Kathy Thorn (Lee Remick)are outstandingly played, as well as wonderfully written an performed supporting characters such as Mrs. Blaylock (Billie Whitelaw), Jennings (David Warner) and Father Brennan (Patrick Troughton). You can't not love this film Gregory Peck, AFI's most beloved hero, gives an awesome performance as Robert Thorn.Richard Donner, did not want this picture to be considered a horror movie, so he made it as believable as possible. Let me say mission accomplished, all deaths can be explained as perfectly circumstantial.</fullReview>

When Richard Donner was conducting the audition for the character to play Damien, he only asked all the boys to try to attack him the same way Damien attacked Lee Remick in the car outside the church. After three hundred and some little actors, Harvey Stephens flew out of the line and started punching the sh-- out of him, kicked him in the crotch, and pulled at his hair for almost twenty seconds. After which, Donner shoved Stephens off of him. He ordered the makeup crew to dye his blond hair black, and cast him as Damien.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly above average but not a classic by any means</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the impending arrival of the remake, some people out there are engaging in vivid, inexplicable fantasies about how this movie is some sort of classic. Tisn't the case. 'The Omen' is a a fairly decent horror movie, but it's needlessly slow and hasn't aged well. Now, I wasn't around at the time, but ample evidence suggests that the key to 'The Omen's popularity is rooted in the famed decapitation scene and the general creativity and outlandishness of the other death scenes. In short, it relied on shock value, and it's no longer shocking, so you haven't got too much left to work with. It isn't a bad movie, just a very average one, and certainly not one that should be mentioned alongside 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'The Exorcist', 'Night of the Living Dead', 'Dawn of the Dead' and so on.As if you didn't know, the plot's like this: There's this kid who is the Anti-Christ, and he starts killin' those who find out his true nature, as they generally tend not to be to pleased with this intel. That is, in all seriousness, the short and long of it. Now a lack of plot is fine in horror movies, often a good thing, but 'The Omen' drags us through what little plot there is very, very gradually. We basically just watch the characters figure all this out, which takes them a helluva long time as Thorn wanders from place to place, and are treated to the occasional death scene, which are, again, no longer truly remarkable and which are few and far between. The problem with this film, more than the general slowness and unimpressive plot, is that it can't really generate much atmosphere. I suppose it's impossible to say why a film *failed* to create an oppressive atmospher, beyond that most of the individual occurrences and elements, like the nasty dog and evil nanny, just aren't particularly interesting or unnerving. Contributing to this problem, Goldsmith's much lauded pseudo-Gothic score is cheesy and overwrought rather than ominous. Furthermore, Gregory Peck is dull and unsympathetic as the evil Damien's 'father'. He's mostly just miscast. This is Atticus Finch we're talking about here. He doesn't belong in a horror movie. None of the other performances are of any note at all.Now, I've done nothing but complain, so I must again reiterate that this isn't a bad movie. None of the flaws I've mentioned are fatally bad, but they're notable and, again, it doesn't have anything truly great about it to offset these concerns. Still, the death scenes, the heart of the movie,, are still sufficiently amusing. Again, nothing shocking or especially elaborate by modern day standards, but they're still fairly cool. Nothing you won't have seen before, but most of it is worth a second look.Though I can't know for sure yet, obviously, I can't help but suspect that for once a re-make will actually make the original obsolete this time. I see no evidence that the execution in the remake is anything more than average, but it was no more than average the first time around, and it has got 30 years worth of special effects development on its side as well as tens of millions of dollars. Still, it seems like a waste, since it looks like they've taken an average film, and then made another average, but more slick and expensive, film out of it. Whatever the case, 'The Omen' is now probably only of interest to horror buffs, and they'll almost certainly already have seen it. It's merely passable, but that, of course, means that it is still good enough, if just barely.Edit: I've since seen the remake, and it is indeed superior, though not a great film by any stretch of the imagination. Very much the same thing, but the vastly improved production values and generally livelier performances elevate it quite a bit. The remake is arguably more flatly silly at times, but that just ups the entertainment value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not A Good Sign</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**CHOCK FULL O' SPOILERS** If there was any doubt as to Gregory Peck's place in film history, his performance in "The Omen" should settle any arguments. Although he exhibits the exact same traits (dignity, patience, reserve) that won him an Oscar for playing Atticus Finch in "To Kill A Mockingbird," he is wholly inappropriate and entirely unsympathetic in this film. A great actor adjusts, a great actor remains open to different characters, different styles, different genres of film... did Greg not realize that this was a horror movie?Here he plays an American Ambassador who adopts an infant named Damien, whom we later learn is the spawn of Satan. Notice I say WE learn... Mr. Peck is skeptical, and even after being warned by a priest, witnessing his nanny's senseless suicide, visiting the grave of Damien's canine mother, and discovering the death of his own wife he still isn't sure he's dealing with the genuine article. In a bad device direct from bad horror films, Greg has to check for the "666" birthmark in his son's scalp. Of course, by then it's too late...See Peck stiffen, and contain all emotion... see Peck go twenty screen minutes without changing his facial expression... see Peck conveniently declare he does not believe, just long enough for a main character to be killed off. I was very disappointed in this picture. I expected a horror classic but what I got was a spooky story stretched skinny and a reluctant lead whose main personality trait was being so THICK that it took him two hours to accept what everyone knew walking into the theater. On a positive note, the sequel "Damien: Omen II" is a better, scarier movie, and certainly holds up much better than this dreary bad dream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was ok, but I was disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is worth seeing, but I had some problems with it.(Some spoilers...)1) I can't stand Gregory Peck. I am sorry, but he delivers each line exactly the same way. He is so wooden, and I feel he and Lee Remick are miscast. She is this beautiful young looking woman, and he is so much the "elder statesman." Gross.2) The first hour of the movie drags. I could have done without all the exterior shots in Rome and exposition of the Ambassador Thorne character. I really didn't care about him one lick, even from the first scene. It took too long to get down to the goods with Damien. And even when he is developed, we never get a full sense of his evil or what he is capable of. Call that "restraint" but I just call it a missed opportunity to spice up the film.And if this is the incarnation of the devil...all he gets in the house as protection is a dog and a nanny? This was a bit weak and didn't align with the creativity of the other deaths that occur exterior to the house.3) When we do get action, it is great - such as the photographer's run in with the plate glass...and the infamous tricycle scene that has an incredible build up...But beyond that, moments of good camera work (the tricycle scene again) were drowned out by lots of boring set ups and uninteresting camera angles. The film has gotten kind of dated - the film stock looks really grainy and the colors are muted (again, adding to the boredom effect).I was expecting alot from this movie, but having just watched "Suspiria," "Cat People," and "Dead Alive," "The Omen" totally pales in comparison...Maybe I am just not taken by the whole theme of the clash of cosmic forces of good and evil...the whole Christianity plot line was like a dead weight to me...I am glad I saw it, but I won't be watching it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-made trash.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it: this is trash. A very badly-written script gets made and expects us to believe in the existence of the Devil made flesh, and of supernatural acts making the Devil's wishes real. It also expects us to believe in these over-the-top hysterics of people who don't sound the least bit human. Really, it's trash. Now that that's out of the way, it's trash that's well-made. Some of it has to do with Richard Donner, who knows how to set things up, and a lot of it, I think, has to do with Lee Remick. She manages to make herself grounded in reality as an innocent who doesn't know what's going on around her--that's what makes her horror scenes so frightening, because we imagine ourselves behaving the same way. And where Gregory Peck seems so ridiculous on his own, his scenes with her make us feel sympathy for him, because he shows genuine love for his wife(considering how good Remick looks, who can blame him?). I wouldn't give the film as high a rating as IMDB has, but I give the movie its due for making people scared out of foreboding and a sense of powerlessness to stop what's happening. All the same, this is a REALLY trashy movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best of the Satanic subgenre of horror films. Made in 1976, the movie dates well for the most part, with few of the horrendous fashion mistakes that make so many 70s films unintentionally campy. It has all the trademarks of the genre: a pseudo-Gregorian chant score and lots of Catholic mysticism (why aren't the Southern Baptists or the Presbyterians ever the only thing standing between humanity and Satan? Maybe it's because they don't have the black clothes or suitably lavish places of worship).Still, the movie suffers from serious flaws that keep it from being entirely successful.What works is a nicely turned performance from Gregory Peck as the "father" of the child Damien, who turns out to be the embodiment of the antichrist. Following a few mysterious deaths and some warnings from a frankly creepy Catholic priest, he becomes aware that his five year old child may be more than he appears.Billie Whitelaw also seems creditably spooky as the nanny in the service of satan.The sets and cinematography are nice, although the soundtrack leaves much to be desired.What doesn't work is a phoned-in performance from Lee Remick, who in all fairness has absolutely nothing to do in this movie. She's missing all of the coquettishness that made her so attractive in her best work, and even in the early part of the movie acts like she'd rather be anywhere else.[Minor spoilers here.] The script, extensively rewritten by director Richard Donner, was probably improved over the original, however, there are some gaping plot holes that manage to rob the film of its believability. The chain of evidence that leads Peck to believe that his child may be the antichrist is particularly tenuous, considering the implications: it's hard to imagine anyone leaping to the conclusions that he does. In another example, when Peck is in Italy following the clues given him by the creepy priest, he gets the news by phone that his wife has died, however, rather than hop the next plane back to London, he jets off for Jeruslaem.Flaws aside, The Omen may not be a classic, but it's a watchable, and depending on your ability to believe in Biblical prophecies, pretty scary film.</fullReview>

Who was the priest, why did he had the mark, what was his relation with that archeologist guy and why didn't he told everything to Peck's character instead of sending him to Israel? And oh yeah that grave thing was simply idiot. The evil italian priest should have hided the bodies, not buried them with names and dates on an old cemetery where the graves would be immediately noticeable. stupid.- The music. It's great, chilly music. Alone. By itself. But in the picture it's just annoying. Too loud, too omnipresent, too much. You can tell what's going to happen because of it. A good film music is a music you don't notice. There were moments when I just wanted the music to shut up so I could focus on what was going on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although considered a horror classic, the Omen fails to compel the viewer in the same way as The Exorcist did andalthough it is quite scary, it never reaches the intense horror and perversion of Rosemary's Baby. The eternal subject of the Antichrist is an over- exploited one. The Omen focuses on the malevolent child whose destiny is supposedly the annihilation of the human race. The kid is the biggest flaw of the movie: it's not particularly flattering to think that the downfall of humanity will be caused by a brainless, hysterical wimp. After all, you would expect from the Devil's child a form of rudimentary intelligence.How could evil be there where there seems to be only mental retardation? In spite of this unfortunate fact, the movie is gorgeous (especially the scenes in Italy) and occasionally gives you the creeps. ** 1/2 out of 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a disappointment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many films have reputations for being very good for one reason or another. "The Omen" is famous for being a chiller about the coming of the Antichrist. It has an impressive cast including Gregory Peck. So I figured I would check it out because truly scary films are hard to find. Watching the film, I nearly fell asleep. There is some heavy subject matter here, but surprisingly, it is not handled well&gt; . The child, Damien, has virtually no speaking part. This could have made Damien more eerie, but here it just makes him a cardboard cut-out evil character. Peck keeps getting frightened by rottweilers who keep appearing, and while they are supposed to create a feeling of dread, it is laughable to watch Peck's character jump around like he's just seen a ghost. I don't mean to keep harping on the bad performances, but they are what doom the picture. The only actor who seems to put anything behind the character is Malcolm McDowall. Unfortunately, his photographer character is not enough to save this from being a great disappointment of a movie. It is quite interesting, but that's all. It is slow-moving and full of characters who are quite dull. Characters that I could care less about. Take my advice: Don't waste your time. Life is too short. Check out "The Exorcist" or something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A decade ago I may have rated The Omen at 8/10. At the time of its release this movie gave The Exorcist a run for its money as the big-budget box office devil-drama champ. I saw The Omen again recently and noticed that it's just not aging well.The principals of Gregory Peck and Lee Remick are still enjoyable, but two generations of Satan movies later, the whole thing seems stale.Gregory Peck plays the supposed father of the devil boy, Damien. After a series of malevolent occurrences he realizes who the boy really is and travels to Italy and the holy land to find help in destroying him.There are some famous scenes in this movie that have become icons in the horror movie business- most especially the maid hanging herself during a party and Damien knocking his mother off the second floor balcony, but other than that, there's really minimal shock value in the thing. The filmmakers feed you a fictional and contrived antichrist theology to sell the whole idea. It spawned two mediocre sequels.The Exorcist was better in concept and execution and even though Rosemary's Baby had already gone before it, it started off a whole horror genre in the '70s. The Omen was the next big thing a few years later but definitely hangs a few rungs lower on the ladder. it's better than Poltergeist though, I'll give it that.</fullReview>

Now, all I could see are "controversial" ideas used as a means of marketing the movie. Of course, you can't really call them clichés, as they were used for the first or second time, but now the plot seems "just another devil movie".Of course, back in 76 you had no real visual effects, you had to rely on actors really playing their part. I think Gregory Peck did a good job. I continue to dislike Lee Remick as I did in childhood, so I didn't really cry when she died. I even liked the dogs. I should check my hair these days.Anyway, the atmosphere is rather well created, mad priests screaming nonsense and all, but then you could sell something like this. I will watch parts 2 3 and 4 these days and come up with more comments on movies.Conclusion: it is rather difficult to watch these days, it certainly employs film methods that are now obsolete, but it is a good movie, a bit above average. It might be interesting to compare with the 2006 remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A commercial bullseye.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Exorcist" made an awful lot of money, so it was inevitable that there follow a spate of supernatural thrillers. This is one of the first, itself to be followed by I forget how many sequels and imitations.Suspenseful, gory, and thoroughly commercial, this slice of machine-processed turkey baloney was notable for a couple of reasons. Pretty stylish goings on, what with the Ambassador to the Court of St. James and all that. Well-known stars too, Peck and Lee Remick. And, finally, "The Exorcist" didn't have any violence to speak of but "The Omen" made up for it. Reviewers couldn't help commenting on the shocking violence. Poor David Warner. His head is not only lopped off by a sheet of glass but it rolls over and over like a bocce ball.It's hard to believe now that this was once considered a shockingly violent supernatural thriller. It's been overtaken by its own vulgarity. Subsequent film makers promptly deep sixed the supernatural element or minimized its importance. Since the point was to establish a cascade of gore -- period -- why shoot it in fancy, expensive locations? And let's get rid of the tiresome plot logic, which might cause someone to think? Let's just have evil incarnate. Give him fingers with scissors on the end and have him slice up nubile young girls on the screen. Or have a group of semi-naturals stumble into a farm run by a family of ghouls and maniacs. Nobody will notice the holes in the Swiss cheese plot because the entire plot will be one big hole. Nobody will care anyway.And nobody did.That said -- "that" being that commercial greed begets commercial greed -- this isn't bad as far as these things go. There are only four truly violent episodes and they're set up more carefully than we would now take for granted. The plot is still an attempt at a story. And the locations are neat and the acting not bad. David Warner is not too well cast. His angular, leptosomic form and horse face seem better suited to comedy or bitchery. The script doesn't help anyone. "Have no fear, Little One. I am here to protect thee." ("Thee"?) And the priest is afflicted with what might be called the gibberish syndrome. A person has some extremely important information to tell someone else and finally finds himself in a position to do it, within some tight time constraints. But instead of laying out the message linearly, he begins spouting gibberish. The priest doesn't say, "You've adopted the anti-Christ." His visage becomes that of a lunatic with red-rimmed eyes and he keeps chanting, "Eat the body and drink the blood of Christ," over and over.Nice, shivery scene though when Peck and some other Nosy Parker are chased through a cemetery by a pack of savage Rottweilers with the hydrophobia dripping out of their jaws. The score is by Jerry Goldsmith, who did the splendid "Chinatown." In this case he resorts to the generic -- pounding drums, shrieking strings, a male chorus chanting "Satanic" verses -- like Karl Orff on mushrooms. Nothing, though, can lift it out of its own sump. The producers clearly designed the climax in a way that could lead to a sequel or sequels if there still seemed another nickel might be made out of it. That happened, pari passu. The originality and craftsmanship behind "The Exorcist" was long forgotten. How about this? We get rid of the human writers entirely and just program a computer to grind out variations on themes?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good horror movie, but it feels a little outdated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omen is a fun horror movie, but there are better ones out there. The movie certainly pales in comparison to the Exorcist, and hasn't aged as well. The acting is very good, especially from Billy Whitelaw who gives an awesome performance as Mrs. Baylock. The use of music was good, and the atmosphere well done. Unfortunately, the movie moves at a rather slow pace, and doesn't seem to benefit from this pacing. The film could have been trimmed down a bit without affecting the story.Overall, I give The Omen a 7/10. Definitely worth seeing for horror fans. The remake is pretty good as well. The Exorcist is still the greatest of the 'possession' films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"First is usually best . . . "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember dinner at a restaurant with two friends, one a second-tier executive at 20th Century Fox, a few months before the premiere of "The Omen." "'The Omen' is gonna make 'The Exorcist' look like a tea party," he enthused.It didn't.Here's why."The Exorcist" had been a publishing phenomenon several years earlier, in 1971. William Peter Blatty's terrifying, believable and well-written novel had taken the country by storm -- like nothing, perhaps, since Margaret Mitchell's "Gone With the Wind." The film of "The Exorcist" two years later was an equal phenomenon. No one had ever seen images like these, heard lines like these, or so starkly faced a graphically horrific cinematic depiction of Evil like it before.Then, a few years later, along comes "The Omen." The entire project, from conception to realization to novelization felt like, and is, another in the long history of Hollywood cynically cannibalizing success.The book, written simultaneously with the script, by David Seltzer, is an evolving example of "synergistic marketing." But neither the book nor the film ever achieved the legendary status of "The Exorcist" novel and film.It DID make money, however. Particularly for Gregory Peck, whose deal gave him a percentage. It became his most financially successful endeavor.Aside from the "me too" cynicism underlying the creation of "The Omen" trying to capitalize on the worldwide success of "The Exorcist," other factors worked against it.First: the Stars. Lee Remick and Gregory Peck were terrific actors. They were also household names.NOBODY in "The Exorcist" was a household name at the time, with the possible exception of Lee J. Cobb. That lack of instantly recognizable actors helped anchor the "realism" of "The Exorcist." These people didn't look or act like movie stars: they looked like us.Gorgeous Lee Remick and handsome Gregory Peck, on the other hand, had been movie stars for decades. No matter how wonderful their performances (and "The Omen" was hardly the high-point of either career), they were still glamorous movie stars acting out lives of incredible wealth and prestige as the parents of Damien.Despite Ellen Burstyn's portraying a screen actress in "The Exorcist," we never get even a hint that she's particularly rich, or a glamor queen. She's a working actress, that's all.Basically, then, we've got old Satan at work in a supposedly real-life story of an exorcism which first became a massive best-selling novel and then a massively successful film, about "real" people being possessed by the Devil . . . versus a derivative film about incredibly rich and glamorous people (what was Gregory Peck? An Ambassador?) unknowingly raising the spawn of Satan -- in the form of a not-terribly-convincing child actor who subsequently went into real estate in real life. A wise consideration on his part, since what's the kid gonna do? Continue playing in ever-less-respectable sequels like, "Damien Hits Puberty," "Damien's First Date," "Damien Does 'The View'?"No. Real estate is the logical choice. Harvey Stephens is no Haley Joel Osment.Had "The Omen" come before "The Exorcist," either as a novel or film, it might have gleaned more respect than it does today.Even admiring comments here admit the film has not aged well.Its original release was considered "disappointing" compared to "The Exorcist." The fright value was less. The quality of everything from the script to the direction to the production was less. The acting in "The Omen" was fine. But, "if it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage." "The Omen" suffered, then, by comparison to "The Exorcist." It still does. It always will. It's second-rate.The original is always best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Main Story Line is Anything But Fantasy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Stephen Hanchett's book, Is George Bush the Antichrist?, is much more carefully reasoned and impressively researched than the movie, here; but, with a dangerously misleading limitation which ultimately and ironically serves to make it the fulfillment of II Thessalonians 2:11!!! Is George Bush the Antichrist? The answer is, paradoxically, both yes and no--but, more basically, the answer is no!--Just as the selfsame description applies to Hitler! Embodying the true configuration of Biblically Prophetic Patterning (but without being able to elaborate adequately, in this brief space, upon most of the finely and scripturally/historically demonstrable details) is a comprehensively paradigmatic unfolding of the story of Joseph (Genesis 37-50), from the time he was sold into slavery by his eleven brothers (the other sons of Jacob), until the time of the Exodus, subsequent to his death. His having been sold into slavery was a prophetic foreshadowing of Exodus 1:8-14. His having become a servant in the Egyptian house of Potiphar represents the physical nation of Israel under the Old Covenant Law. His removal, from there, to Pharaoh's prison (but, in his case, like unto Christ's, whom he foreshadows, on a false charge) represents the numerologically and historically decipherable (Leviticus 26) 2520-year period of national punishment inflicted, first, upon the even hitherto displaced, but not for much longer (Ezekiel 37:15-28), and "lost" ten tribes of Israel at Samaria (II Kings 18:9-12), and, then, over one-hundred years later, upon the Kingdom of Judah at Jerusalem (II Kings 25), for Israel's breach of the Covenant of Deuteronomy 28. The first half, or 1260 years, of these world-ruling empires, or seven heads, of Revelation 13:1, culminates with the wounding of Rome, the seventh head, or fourth beast (Daniel 7), in 476 A.D.; just as the second 1260 years, from 554 A.D., with the healing of Rome's mortal head wound, by Justinian, to 1814 A.D., with the fall of Napoleon, consist of the "Christianized" or "Holy" Roman Empire, an eighth beast (Revelation 17:11), which both is and is not of the seven, in that it is and is not Christian (Galatians 1:6-9), but fundamentally and ultimately is not (Matthew 6:24) (Mark 9:38-50) (Revelation 3:15-17; 18:4). . . . Moreover, this eighth beast is, not only on the seventh head, but is also an image or reflection of the original beast, with still another seven heads and ten horns. Charlemagne, for instance, is, as the third horn and first head on the resurrected or eighth beast, a mirror image of Nebuchadnezzar; while, at the other end, Napoleon is a mirror image of Alexander the Great, and Hitler is an image of Antiochus Epiphanes. Most intriguingly, though, just as there is no head like unto the seventh, there is no head like unto the seventh of the seventh (Daniel 7:7). With the fall of Napoleon, is to be found the benchmark date of the restoration of the birthright promise to Israel, originally bestowed, by God, through Jacob (Israel), to his two half-Egyptian grandsons (the sons of Joseph), Ephraim and Manasseh, the "Great Nation" and "Company of Nations" (British Commonwealth) existing today (Genesis 48). The concept of American Manifest Destiny is biblically-rooted, but also bitterly betrayed by those blessed and honored with the duty of fulfilling it, as a virtuously magnanimous example and inspiration to the world! Because of this tragically modern repetition of the ancient breaking of the Covenant by Israel, the Birthright Nations shall again be taken captive, but, this time, for 2520 days instead of years, divided, again, into two 1260-day intervals (Revelation 13:5), which structurally reflect the 2520-year intervals, but in reverse order. The "Man of Sin," in II Thessalonians 2:1-8, who was finally revealed, when the explicitly pagan Roman Empire had been moved out of the way, ruled for 1260 years. Currently, she (Rome) is a widow (Revelation 18:7), minus her "Holy Roman Emperor" upon whom to ride. However, She shall be uniquely, overshadowingly preeminent, once again, when the ancient beast rises, one last time, over the ashes of the Birthright Nations. . . . In that particular vein, here's just a small structural indication of how history repeats itself, but not exactly in the same ways, although unaccidentally close enough--here--to be Divinely-instructive, teleologically as well as axiologically! Compare Hitler's invasion and carving up of Czechoslovakia to the current occupation of Iraq; just as Iran shall be, for America, what Poland had been, for Hitler, and Germany--and the world! Obviously, then, Joseph's removal from prison in Egypt, and appointment by Pharaoh as the second most powerful man in Egypt, represents the crushing of the head of the eighth beast, in 1814, and the reinstatement of the ancient Birthright Promise to Ephraim and Manasseh, a material and national blessing, to be distinguished from the Scepter Promise to Judah (Genesis 49:8-10). And, of course, the shortly-upcoming dissolution of the Birthright Nations (Revelation 12) is anciently symbolized in the Pharaoh who "knew not Joseph," and the bitterly tragic consequences of that! The ancient "Apocalypse" which God, through Moses, had brought upon Egypt, was a type of what shall shortly occur on a global scale, when the seventh seal opens, as it does only once, at the beginning of the latter 1260-day interval shortly to come; while the first six seals open three times, with the last, or "Anti-Typal" opening shortly to occur, at the beginning of the first 1260-day interval. . . . For a continuation of this critique, go to the first sequel to this film, Damien: Omen II.</fullReview>

The new one simply had better effects and makes the deaths a bit more bloody, it didn't have any scenes that would make you jump in your seat.The original has an underlying chill sort of atmosphere and is simply better in its way to give a few scares.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must have been excellent in the late 70's, but in today's standards - lacking, to say the least.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a devout Horror fan who fancies himself a Horror freak, I've wanted to familiarize myself with some of the genre's classics. The process included watching the full series of Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th and Children of the Corn, and it was only a matter of time before my "travels" took me to The Omen.While watching the film (as well as writing this review) I've made sure to bear in mind that this was a film from the late 70's, when several aspects of the Cinema field have not yet developed, or at least not yet fully matured. For instance, what I've found to be most blunt, has been the acting. Throughout the film I haven't been able to not notice that the actors appear to be acting for the sake of acting, rather than to try and appear realistic and assist suspense of disbelief (very much like actors in musicals and plays in the theatre, who act like actors in a play or musical rather than like "real" characters). Furthermore, the "struggle" scenes (weather with other characters or beasts) all appear very unrealistic. And lastly, little Harvey Stephens, while adorable and precious, simply failed to frighten me in any way...Much of that criticism is probably due to the time the film was screened, when the a woman hanging herself, a man having his head chopped of and the very thought of children being possessed by the devil were enough to startle, unnerve and even shock an audience. Add to that the fact that I happen to be Jewish and not Christian, and you might understand why The Omen didn't really leave such an impression on me.However, having said that, if I do take consideration of the time the film was screened, I can very well understand how groundbreaking and innovative it must have been, and how many spectators have probably been really frightened by it. The story and script were good, the poor lighting and visual effects were probably (yet again) fine for the 70's, and the ending probably had people on the edges of their seats.All in all, I'm afraid I've been born too late and am too young to be able to fully appreciate The Omen, one of the masterpieces of the genre. I consider it my personal loss. However, I've had a great time watching it, and I recommend it to anyone who's a Horror fan and/or a fan of late 70's cinema.</fullReview>

The dark side is never shown, sent or even perceived. Only talking - not a single thrilling scene. The exorcist - this movie is being compared to it - is far better and much more complex. Not only a horror movie but a masterpiece which stays in my mind even a decade after watching it.The omen will be forgotten very soon. Even the soundtrack is repeating the same boring plot musically and it never reaches a "peak". Only the short scene with the biking killing is remarkable but Kubrick took it and made it far better in The shining!not worth at all to be watched</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good old fashioned horror movie, but nothing more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies dealing with religious and apocalyptic themes are "get under your skin and make you think" scary, and reflect the natures of good and evil represented in the Biblical accounts. Omen isn't one of those movies, but it sure *wants* to be. To be honest, I found the film's treatment of religious prophecies too laughably inaccurate to be as chilling as many people have said it was. If taken as seriously as its creators obviously intended it, then it would seem like extremist religious propaganda! I didn't find the characters to be intriguing, so their fates didn't upset me. The ending is predictable. It is a good example of 70s suspense and horror, but nothing deeper than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Donner's The Omen is said to be one of the best and scariest movies ever put on film by lots of people but many don't think so including me. The movie tells the lame story of Ambassador to Great Britain Robert Thorn and his wife Kathy Thorn (played by Gregory Peck and Lee Remick)who just gave birth to a still born and adopt the anti-Christ (aka the son of the devil) without even realizing it. There is a lot of huge mistakes within the course of the film which includes the acting, directing, poor writing, and story etc. And there are only about two things that I do like about the movie and they are the casting, and the terrifying score by the great Jerry Goldsmith. The scene that i hate most in this film is the ending and that was (SPOILER ALERT!) when Peck's character is going to kill the so called "adopted son of his" tries to kill his son Damian who is the anti-Christ (played by Harvey Stephens)and then the police kill him and the attempted murder victim survives the attack. What a very dumb, and stupid so called "Horror film".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty overrated horror movie .....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankly, THE OMEN is a bit overrated in my opinion. GREGORY PECK is too dour. There was no chemistry between him and LEE REMICK. And the photographer suspecting paranormal forces based on photographs was hard to digest. I couldn't believe that all these seemingly rational (albeit mildly religious) people were ready to believe in the influence of Satan. Unlike in THE EXORCIST, the parents being forced to believe in demonic influences were not convincing enough.Overall, the parts were better than the whole. Some of the frames looked like paintings and there are some interesting directorial flourishes. I bet they spent a bomb on this. But it really is not in the same league as say THE EXORCIST or THE SHINING. This was a re-watch and I was underwhelmed, I remember liking it a lot when I watched it as a teenager.(6.5/10)</fullReview>

I was high hoped, I guess, because of it's reputation and my grandmother told me it scared the hell out of her when she first saw it. When I watched it I found it more funny than scary. It's like everything about the movie is fine but flaw full: The plot's OK but it's been seen before, the actors are OK but not convincing, etc... That's basically it. It's an "Ok, but..." movie. I must say though, there were some interesting moments of the movie. But in overall, I was disappointed. If You find the son of the devil scary, I guess you'd find it scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember this movie being just the scariest movies ever; I actually recall reading the movie ads as a 7 year old (yes, even then!) and thinking Gregory Peck's first name was "Georgy." :)Anyway, I remember finally getting to see the Omen on cable and being quite impressed; however, I saw it recently and am sad to say that it does not hold up well at all.The whole "Child-as-Satan," "Dog-as-Satan,""Anything You Want as Satan" themed movies are now cliche almost 30 years after this film came out, so there's one reason why it looks so cheesy after so long. I noticed is alternately quiet (sometimes filled with overbearing dialogue)and terribly noisy (I hit the mute button during the scary dog attack..! Dogs barking, the 2 men yelling, and that horrid Satanic Mormon Tabernacle Choir going to town! My ears!!)I guess another thing I disliked was the altogether SERIOUSNESS of the movie....is there anyone who smiles in this movie just because they're happy?? Okay, maybe Lee Remick. Once. *SPOILER* I still recall the Mad Magazine parody where as Gregory Peck's character is about to kill Damien, he tells the cops, "But you don't understand, this child is the DEVIL!!" and the cop responds, "Eh, my kid's no angel, either, but I'm not gonna KILL him for it!" LOL I would've liked to had a couple jokes thrown in here and there...someone with a pitchfork, Damien learns his multiples of "6" very quickly...a cameo by Marilyn Manson...ANYthing to lighten the mood!Kinda funny that Holly Palance (Jack's daughter and used-to-be co-host of Ripley's Believe it or Not) plays Damien's dedicated, yet tragic first nanny.Anyway, a sad letdown...</fullReview>

However-I can't say that I like this movie very much. I am a big fan of pschological thrillers-this was a combo of that and a classic horror but as much as it scared the heck out of me it didn't do much else-Many of the scarier movies from that time period wove more then just a scary spell-they made me appreciate the great story telling and I developed a real fondness for the movies over the years.(Jaws, The exorcist for example.) Not so-The Omen. It was just fear for fear's sake-to much tension but no fascination with the overall storyline. I'm not a big fan of this movie though I DO give it a 10 of 10 in terms of the sheer fear factor-lastly, If anyone reading this has not seen "The Other" check it out-it's even scarier then this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Omen stars Gregory Peck as an ambassador who is told his son has died in childbirth and is offered another baby. He agrees and hides this fact from his wife, Lee Remick. Right off the bat, this film shows how stupid it is. What father in his right mind would accept the baby, not tell his wife, and not even want to see the real dead baby? This film goes downhill from this point, and this is only the start of the film. There is one stupid scene after another and each one is more ridiculous than the previous scene. It's one thing to ask the audience to suspend their disbelief, but the writing in this film is so dumb it's unbelievable. The plot is that Peck's adopted son, Damien, is Satan's child. Of course, you're never told where he came from or why Satan decided to have a child in the first place. Damien is just a little kid and he's not scary at all. Neither is anything in this film for that matter. The ending is what really annoyed me. Damien turns to the camera and smiles. Big deal. This was supposed to be scary? It's just funny.</fullReview>

I red it was a classic and it was a ''must watch''. I had high expectations, so I started watching the film. IN the first hour, I just really noticed that the film was lacking character development, the main character, he's name is named rarely, it does though mostly at the end. That new lady that comes in the house of Robert, who is she exactly? They should have put more background but of course in the end we get to know who she is, the little boy, not a lot of background. Same goes with each character..The story was okay though, no doubt about that, nothing special but nothing good. Robert played a good performance in the film, the other characters were horrible. I was disappointed with this film, the lack of character development and detail made the film bad but what made it more bad was the story. Yes i know, i said it was okay, it was but, they had to put more and focus more. It's hard to explain..but anyway. The ending was good but it still doesn't make sense..I don't recommend this film at all unless you really want to see it.3 out of 10 is my score for this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Omen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the terrifying story about a boy named Damien who had many evil powers. His parents, father Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) and mother Katherine Thorn (Lee Remick) assumed that things were happening by coincidence, but they weren't. For example, whenever the father drives Damien (Golden Globe nominated Harvey Stephens) past a church, Damien screams with fear (as the Devil would), so maybe Damien is a representation of the devil on earth, or his son. Keith Jennings (David Warner) is convinced that Damien is evil because of all the signs, or rather, all the "omens". The only way of stopping these things happening is to kill Damien, but obviously the father has loved him for too long he cannot find courage to do it. Also starring BAFTA nominated Billie Whitelaw as the evil Mrs. Baylock and Patrick Troughton as Father Brennan. A very terrifying film with some devilish parts, including Damien causing his mother to die, and of course, Warner's beheading scene with the sheet of glass, and a good ending. The moment where he sees the three 6's on Damien's head, representing the anti-Christ, is the true moment where Peck knows the evil son. There has been a legend since the film was made of a "curse" on many people involved in the making, e.g. the guy that helped make the beheading scene had a car crash approximately 6.66 miles from a town called Omene, was it coincidence, or was it the devil at work? It won the Oscar for Best Music for Jerry Goldsmith, and it was nominated for Best Song for Goldsmith's "Ave Satani". It was number 81 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 9 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, and it was number 25 on The 50 Greatest British Films. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Omen does NOT deserve its classic status, not in my opinion. It's no different than any other 70s exploitation flicks. Whereas rubbish like Last House on the Left and others were considered trashy and confined to grindhouse cinemas, The Omen (a really crap title when you think about it) undeservedly got a higher status because of the cast and studio.LHOTL was honest about being nonsense, but The Omen, desperate to be the next Exorcist, manipulated and preyed upon the naive public's fears of THE DEVIL (dun, dun DUUUUUUUN) with a load of gobbledygook hocus-pocus and characters so stupid you wish they'd just die horribly and get it over and done with.Gregory Peck (a highly respected actor) seems so stiff and bored in his role that every scene with him is difficult to watch. The only actor worth watching in this gibberish is the underrated David Warner.It's just garbage. Cheap, nasty, exploitative garbage and a classic in no way whatsoever. The 2006 remake achieved the impossible and actually made it worse.Oh, and by the way, 'O Fortuna' by Carl Orff has nothing, NOTHING to do with The Omen. Jerry Goldsmith wrote the score to this film (and won an Oscar) and never used this piece, which has bugger-all to do with the Devil, in a single cue. It's an urban legend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aenemic, boring thriller that isn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A strangely boring vehicle for carefully thought our gore rather than shocks, The Omen is a weak film made for poor reasons. Made surely with an eye on the success of The Exorcist, the film fetishizes the occult as a basis for inventive supernatural phenomenon, more often than not resulting in death. The script is thin and the acting unable to transcend it; only David Warner's savvy photographer is a fully fleshed out character.Little is explained or developed, dialogue being usurped by scriptural offcuts which sound portentous in context (like Jules from Pulp Fiction quoting Ezekiel to scare people). A late appearance by Leo McKern has the distant potential to pull the whole sorry mess together but this is quickly rendered a cul-de-sac as well.As a thriller it is a failure as we know the answers to the important questions from the start. As for tension, I can only imagine that Jerry Goldsmith (who I admire) won an Oscar for this score for its novelty (predominantly chanting male voices). Where the music does succeed in creating a scary atmosphere was in my own postmodern mind: the music, like the film seems to be in celebration of the demon's existence rather than in fear of it. 2/10 (I was watching the 25th anniversary edition DVD)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** This so-called "classic" is pathetic. The script is horribly flawed, and the film is directed poorly. The movie itself oozes stereotypical nonsense from spiritually naive people. Don't read on unless you want to be spoiled. The antichrist is afraid of coming with in 100 yards of an epicsopal church? Lol. He's trembling just by coming within view of the structure, then at the end of the movie he's lying on the floor of the church and his dad is trying to kill him, and he seems relatively calm. The inconsistency in this film is nauseating. What the heck did that first nanny have to do with Damien? What was she talking about before she hung herself? Why do Rottweilers have the power of telepathy and mind-control? Why does the second nanny visit the mom in the hospital, push her out the window in front of onlookers, yet 3 days later she's alone at home with Damien instead of in police custody? Why is Gregory Peck 18 years older than Lee Remick? Who in the world was the evil priest, how did he know everything, and why was he so vague with the Embassador if this was so important? Where did the photographer come from? Who was "Bugenhagen" and why did he know everything? Why was there so much non-Biblical fantasy invented for the script, such as having to kill "Damien" with a series of knife blows on hallowed ground? This movie was not believable for a second. The writers obviously had the Biblical knowledge of pissants. This is the king of all turkeys. Ovoid at all costs, unless you particularly enjoy making fun of stupid people. Kickboxer with Jean Claude Van Damme has more credibility than this. The only real question left to answer is this: why did Gregory Peck accept this horrible role? His acting was very good, as usual, but this lemon stained his career in the eyes of anyone who can see through this wafer-thin, logic-devoid cowdung. Avoid at all costs. 1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always enjoyed horror movies,so my dad recommended me to watch this movie. Said and done,i went to rent this movie and started watching. Twenty minutes passed,nothing happened. One hour passed,nothing. When the movie ended i was so disappointed and could not understand why i even bothered to finish the movie. The kid was so darn annoying,the acting was so bad that i almost lost my faith in humanity. The plot is terrible. How this is considered horror is beyond belief. I guess i just cant understand these old horror movies,as almost all of them that i have seen have sucked. This movie can be summarized like this: Family gets worried about their little boy. He has weird markings in his face,gets afraid of the church etc. They should have gotten him professional help for being a little attention wh*re,i hated him so much. Completely waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>stupid. Wake me up when I am supposed to feel scared... z z z z</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stupid movie that shows that Hollywood produced sh*t since the beginning.Let's see the plot. Satan send his child to the world to destroy it or something. Anyone that realizes the truth dies from a horrible death.f*ck me!!! they did 3 movies out of this!!!! and they did a remake from this????? oh, boy.If you want to scare your soul out, don't watch this one.... go and turn on the news. Or you can go and read Poe, or Lovecraft.This one is a fake classic, incredibly overrated movie that remind us that even good actors (C. Walkef, for example) made sh*tty movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hear middle-aged men spout their outdated, biased wisdom all the time. "Modern horror movies are just gory, not scary. The old movies, boy, now those were scary because you didn't always see the monster. If you want scary go watch . . ." And they always finish their statement with whichever popular 70s horror film they first watched in their pre-teens and peed their pants over. To them, there could never be anything scarier because that movie is so ground into their psyche. To the modern viewer, there could never be anything funnier because we've matured and realized the real world is infinitely more terrifying than creaky staircases. I view old horror movies in the same way I view cartoons. They're so over-the-top and ridicules that it's impossible to take them seriously, but they have some entertainment value when you have nothing better to do. There are a handful of exceptions to that last sentence?Alien ('79), The Shining ('80), Black Christmas ('74)?but for the most part, it's a fairly realistic view. While I hoped The Open could have been one of the few exceptions, it isn't. Doesn't even come close.I have a lot of appreciation for the slow opening that builds emotional impact and atmosphere. However, it seems that I can count the films that actually pulled off that style without just adding pointless scenes for the sake of pointless scenes on one hand. In The Omen, the slow build not only adds a lot of pointless scenes?running animals, OH MY!?but it makes the viewer fail to see the difference between this and a Lifetime move. The slow build never once emphasizes the imminent doom hanging over the family's heads; it just pumps the movie full of boredom and cheese. Unless you're frightened by running animals and a kid riding his tricycle, there is nothing subtly frightening here. And the slow build takes up 3/4ths of the entire movie. I'll give The Omen credit for having one well-done abrupt moment of shock near the beginning, but after that it goes back to cliché drama. Horror directors/writers have a false idea that if they immerse you in the daily life of the characters, you'll care about them when they're killed or are nearly killed. The reason that is untrue is because all the characters in The Omen are all flat clichés. Who would have guessed the husband doesn't believe in the supernatural, then by the end is converted into believing the absurd storyline? Who would have guessed the wife is a spineless women who just whines and acts dumb in every scene she has? Drama doesn't build an attachment to characters. It didn't in 1970, it doesn't today. What builds an emotional attachment to characters is characters that actually have CHARACTER. Characters that actually have a personality and aren't just walking horror clichés with legs.The other problem with The Omen is the absurdity of it all. A man's adopted son is really the antichrist?that I can take seriously. Everyone associated with the antichrist is marked with sacrilegious symbols and must be contended with in religious ways?that's just stupid. Being someone with a theological background, the stupidity of religious horror movies always makes me laugh. Instead of actually following scripture and creating a genuinely terrifying experience, there always has to be retarded gobbledygook thrown in to cheese everything up. Instead of accurately portraying a realistic Christian or non-Christian, every last person in these religious horror films have to be a religious extremist of a die-hard atheist. There is just no realism. People site The Omen as one of the movies that subtly frightens you to the point of terror, but that simply isn't true. The Omen bashes you over the head with cheesy, over-the-top Hollywood conventions. I find it ironic: modern horror films bash you with gore and it's not scary; older horror films bash you with cheese and it's REALLY not scary. When I wasn't bored, I was laughing.The Omen isn't a perfectly terrible movie, though. The directing is solid. The slow-mo close-ups of predictable plot points, however, got really stupid really fast. The acting from everyone but the wife is very solid. The wife is possibly the most over-the-top whiney female in any 70s horror film, period. The entire movie carries a very classic feel that most 70s horror movies carry, and that adds some entertainment value. The actual story, if they were to have taken out the gobbledygook, is fairly solid and interesting, even if it isn't anything new or original. And that's all the good I can say.As I said, I appreciate a lot of what made parts of The Omen a solid movie and gained it its classic status. That doesn't mean I can take it seriously, because I can't. It's too ridiculous and pumped with too much cheese. When I think of true terror, I most often think of something realistic. People say "torture porn" and gore isn't scary, but it hits far more raw nerves with me and other horror fans because it's something that could really happen. It's not campy or fun. It's real. It's disturbing. Isn't that what true horror is supposed to be? That doesn't mean I hate old horror movies. Straw Dogs ('71) was the forerunner for Saw ('04). Just because something's old doesn't mean it's good, and just because something's new doesn't mean it's bad. And vice versa. But it's impossible for me to give a high score to The Omen. A lot of my older horror movie reviews spark responses that absentmindedly claim: "You're not a true horror fan because you didn't like this. Go review comedies." To which I respond: I thought I was.1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a child, this was my favourite horror film. Back then, the Omen and the Exorcist were the most talked-about horror flicks that even kids had to see somehow!!! I was quite spooked by the scenes, the sounds, and ohhhhh that background music! However, as an adult, I cannot imagine how idiotic it is to call a child the Antichrist because bad things are happening around him or caused by him.We know nowadays that there are normal youngsters as well as those who are challenged, who are capable of bad things, even things so bad we may call them ''evil''. Now come on, if I saw a boy even commit murder, I would say that he's definitely in need of help. Something's going on for him not to have any empathy or remorse. He's either under tremendous amount of stress or need psychiatric intervention.Yes, I know that this is a supernatural film and has nothing to do with reality. Nevertheless, the viewer cannot really enjoy the film unless she or he finds the plot somehow plausible, at least a little. If you do not believe in a boy capable of being evil, you would never want a father (adoptive or biological) to kill him.The success of this film, the Exorcist and such feed on the ignorance of many, unfortunately. How do you know that after watching this film (which quotes the bible, BTW), is not going to look at his son's head looking for marks of the devil? Many films are based on similar situations in real life, except in horror movies many mundane issues are often given a supernatural explanation. I enjoy spooky films, even those which I know are unintelligent (like a curtain moving may be caused by some unseen hand!), but I cannot stand seeing a child being seen as evil. That makes me afraid for the consequences of watching this film.I'm not religiously affiliated, fortunately. I also understand that many people are not directly affected and will not make life choices based on a horror film. However, this film teaches that a child can be evil, rather than stressed, mentally ill, in need of help, or maybe simply innocent.Please do NOT watch it, don't let your kids watch it, and don't let any religious people watch it. All we need in this day and age is more people embarking on a crusade against children with problems.</fullReview>
