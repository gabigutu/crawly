		<shortDescription>A Mixed Bag</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many questions raised by this film that it is difficult to review it. The original screenplay by Douglas Morrow (1956) has been 'updated' by writer/director Peter Hyams, and while the concept of the plot is a strong one, it requires rather savvy actors to make it work. Aside from Michael Douglas as the DA of questionable ethics and court proceedings, the rest of the cast is a rather ill-prepared group of nascent actors in need of more experience than in the fluff films from which they came.C.J. Nicholas (Jesse Metcalfe) enters the Shreveport scene complete with a prize for reporting, eager to make it big and earn a Pulitzer: he seems to have an equal obsession with chasing young pretty women and finds one in the person of Ella Crystal (Amber Tamblyn) who happens to be the assistant to the DA. Nicholas, and his entertaining co-worker Corey (Joel David Moore), are on to something - they believe that the DA tampers with forensic evidence to win cases, focusing on phony DNA samples rather than thorough investigation. Out to debunk the DA, Nicholas plans to plant evidence at a crime scene, a stunt he will later use to expose the wannabe Governor DA, and in order to make this work, he places himself as the 'evidential perpetrator' of a crime. He manages to draw Ella into his circle of lust as well as his overall plan to unseat the DA. Things change and the ending could have been surprising in the hands of better actors.The film is heavily padded with the requisite car chases and explosions and derring-do of the good cop/bad cop type, but the real problem with the movie is the weak presence of Metcalfe and Tamblyn. If the viewer can tolerate the confusing aspects of mixing high humor in the first part with the supposed suspense in the second, then the film is worth the entertainment. It could have been a stronger film with a cast of professionals.Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating failure--great idea, poor execution, it's that simple.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (2009)Michael Douglas is impeccable whenever he has a role with brutal power, with cunning, with speechmaking the cuts through the listener, with selfish focus. And he is all these things here.But he is properly the third name on the credits, and the two leads, both little known to me, are young and capable and unexceptional actors. With the three of them, there might have been a decent movie possible.The hook here is an amazing, simple, audacious idea. A young reporter (Jesse Metcalf) is suspicious of a District Attorney (Douglas) who is faking evidence, so he sets himself up as the perp in a crime he didn't commit to trap the DA at his game. So it looks like a hero at work, an undercover reporter who is going to prove justice, Al Pacino style. And he has both a buddy (the not so handsome sidekick) and a girlfriend (Amber Tamblyn). The girlfriend, strategically, is on the staff of the DA.But things go wrong. Very wrong. The DA is more ruthless than they realized. The girlfriend ends up taking over the investigation of her own boss, and ends up uncovering, with some improbability, some flaws in the reporter's character, too. The movie ends with a terrific (not) two word send off, probably meant to appeal to young people who have wanted to say those two words to lots of their boyfriends and girlfriends themselves. Or have.Lots of crime thrillers have plots like this, good ones with twists that are calculated but great entertainment. This one is repeatedly hamstrung by bad writing, however. And this bad dialog is sometimes acted poorly, so that you almost groan out loud. It's especially painful because the plot is pretty intense if you give it a chance. In fact, sometimes it almost seems intentional the way a character acts a little flippant or silly, and yet it struck me as out of place. This might make it impossible to really get the depth of what was intended. Which is too bad. A remake done well would have the potential to really work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unconvincing and full of clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very unconvincing cast, including Douglas, delivers an extremely implausible story packed with clichés, with poor cinematography and old-fashioned music. I am usually OK with implausible stories and the original movie is probably good... but for heaven's sake, if you are going to do a remake, at least try to make it feel like the 21st century. The only thing the movie had going for it was a fairly good dialog (probably derived from the original manuscript to Fritz Langs original from 1956), but the lead actor and actress did a pretty poor job delivering them. I almost feel sorry for Douglas, remembering him in excellent movies like Fatal Attraction, Traffic and Falling Down, having to tarnish his good name with movies like this. I cannot for the life of me understand why he agreed to participate in such a B movie. Maybe he needed money (?) or maybe he cannot bear not being in the spotlight, but even so, he should try to make a reasonable effort. This was not up to his usual standards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond a reasonable script (or acting, or directing)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As many users have indicated before, this is not a good film. I would even go further: this is a disaster of a wanna-be-thriller.Michael Douglas stars in a supporting role and only appears in the few courtroom scenes and two other short sequences - I'd be surprised if his shooting time went beyond two days of (really not convincing) work. The lead role has, indeed, that soap opera guy - and as someone else has rightfully mentioned, it is hard to believe no producer vetoed such a miscast: any scene he is in is unintentionally funny (while at the same time you'll start wondering early on whether this bizarre scenario is worth two hours of your lifetime). I have no idea why anyone would call this a decent script, since this is where the whole shambles begins: it is badly written, doesn't make much sense on many occasions (including the - and this is no spoiler - "twist"), any attempt of being funny goes embarrassingly wrong, the dialogues are flat and uninspired, it's as suspenseful as opening your fridge, and beyond that: it is utterly predictable.The directing is equally disastrous: some of the car chasing scenes remind you of 'Simon &amp; Simon' and other unnecessary trips down Memory Lane of 1980s low-budget television. And the list goes on and on...If I hadn't checked out this reference page on IMDb I would have thought this to be the debut work of a producer's son, possibly made for TV. It is just unbelievably bad. Don't go there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre and disposable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing which stood out for me in the mediocre film Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (2009) was seeing the logo of the company RKO during the opening credits.Sure, it is a modernized digital version (I wish they had kept the "retro" look), but it was still nice to see that that legendary studio keeps being active (or maybe, a nostalgic investor simply bought the rights...I do not know).Unfortunately, that trivial detail was one of the best elements from this movie, because despite the main idea being slightly ingenious, the screenplay develops it on a boring and uninteresting way, at the same time the movie also has bad performances and bland direction from the mercenary Peter Hyams.The screenplay from Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (2009) discards any consistency, and it makes the characters to commit stupid mistakes which go against their character and the most basic common sense.We also feel the squeaks in the narrative gears when the screenplay tries to justify action scenes or moments of suspense in order to bring some life to the inert drama and also distract us from the multiple holes from the story.This film is the remake of a film which was directed in 1956 by the great Fritz Lang (1890-1976), and I suppose that many elements from the original film would feel anachronistic on a contemporary version, so Hyams (on his work as a screenwriter) faced the ungrateful homework of conciliating old concepts with modern technology.As a consequence, we have an erratic logic where the advanced digital analysis of a photograph is possible, but at the same time, the facility of duplicating the digital content of a DVD is ignored.So, the abundance of inconsistencies such as that one, hollow characters and hasty deductions are the main elements which make Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (2009) to be mediocre, boring and disposable.So, in conclusion I cannot recommend this movie.It may not be bad, but it is so mediocre and insipid that I feel I could have used the time I invested in watching it doing something more interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappointing Joke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really--I would be embarrassed to be associated with this movie! I was initially intrigued by the basic plot, but as the movie unfolded I found myself groaning over the poor dialog, disconnected character personalities and unconvincing acting. The premise of the movie was so good, but the details and execution, oh so poor. The soundtrack was laughable as the key subject in the film went from store to store finding the "evidence" that was to be used against him in court. The ending was painful to watch. The dramatic "twist" of the plot at the end was so ill conceived it came across not as an "ah-ha" moment, but a "you've got to be kidding me" moment. The overly dramatic "F-You" at the end was probably the worst ending moment of a film I've ever seen. Save the one dollar you'll spend at Redbox.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thankyou Michael Douglas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantastic story and plot, pathetic acting. What could have been was not and for me this just about achieves a TV afternoon thriller rating. Saved only by a sterling performance by Michael Douglas in portraying someone who could have counted Gordon Gecko as a friend.Sadly, Michael's efforts only serve to highlight lame attempts at action, drama and humor from the rest of the cast as they blunder through a great story, sorely wasted, even trivialized in places. And somehow, even the settings seem low budget and artificial although they obviously are not. Much blame must lie with the director, but the unconvincing portrayals of the other main characters must be due to the cast as well. Watch out for a tired late night policeman and an older, female bank official for some great lesser cameos however.The story is so good that I would gladly watch another remake although this version is in itself a "spoiler". Let the French do it next time!! Watch this movie, but don't pay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subpar thriller that looks straight out of the 80s...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a remake but will be judged on its own merit, especially since I did not see the original. On paper, things look good. You've got the seed of a promising story featuring several characters who could have been interesting, some courtroom drama which could have been intense, some plot twists which could have been shocking and a star lead actor in Michael Douglas who could have sold you this movie with his charisma. But none of it ever happens. And much of the fault lies with Hyams' terribly outdated direction. While he used to direct somewhat interesting films several decades ago, Hyams has long since lost any edge he might have had and every weakness in his style which we readily forgave back in the 80s are now terribly grating when seen in a 2009 movie. The photography is downright boring, the music is cheesy, pacing and editing awful. Everything seems to come out of a made-for-TV or direct-to-video movie featuring Cheryl Ladd or some other has been. Michael Douglas only has a few scenes and gives by far the best performance but that's not saying much in this present case, because everybody else is just terrible. Really awful. On top of that, several lines in the script are embarrassing, which makes the actors' job harder. Jesse Metcalfe and Amber Tamblyn are both the real co-leads of this flick and do absolutely nothing with their screen time. Orlando Jones is terribly miscast. While the premise and basic sketch of the whole plot could have been interesting, neither the writers or the director made it believable. The twists along the way of the story might have been surprising for an average moviegoer in 1984. A quarter of a century later, even a lobotomized hamster will see it from a mile (provided you don't fall asleep before that). There are so many negatives to this movie that usually it would be worth a 1. But I am raising it by one point for Michael Douglas giving a decent performance and by another point for the interesting seed of a story. 3/10 for the last movie by director Hyams I will ever watch</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the almost unanimous negative reviews by viewers and professional critics, I liked "Beyond a Reasonable Doubt". Why? This movie is a combination of an old-fashioned mystery story combined with an indie film style.I have been a longtime fan of old detective films and I also like modern low-budget independent movies like "Management" and "Little Miss Sunshine". This combination of styles; old-fashioned mystery and indie low-budget, didn't bother me.I accepted that many of the actors were not the greatest around today, or that the lighting and sound was almost never polished and was often primitive. And that the music soundtrack was just adequate.But what I very much enjoyed was the story itself. This is a great mystery plot which kept me guessing. And I like those kinds of stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just plain stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This ridiculous movie represent all that is wrong with the Hollywood film industry. You take the plot line of a completely outdated 50's flick, set the story in whatever city's tourist board, gives you the best deal, hire couple of tepid and incredible uncharismatic young half-stars, add in a top billing a major star , little over the hill, and you have a movie. And what an atrocity of a movie this is. I have no intention of wasting my or anybody else's time, so I'll keep it very short.It all happens in Shreveport, LA, but except couple of minor parts nobody has a minute trace of a Southern accent. The shear stupidity of the main character makes you wont to choke him to death. The plot line has more holes than a sieve. Suspending your logic isn't enough, you have to suspend your brain to go through this garbage. Just plain stupid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot full of holes, plus acting full of nothing equals bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gee, let's see... 1. Why didn't C.J.'s defense attorney subpoena C.J.'s boss at the TV station, who would have told the jury that C.J. had been pushing a story about the DA planting evidence? That would have at least put reasonable doubt in the jurors' minds. 2. Michael Douglas warns C.J. that prison phone calls are monitored (duh...). But apparently his flunky co-conspirator detective wasn't aware that parking garages serving the DA's office would probably be videotaped. Besides, the donut-creating "terror" scene was stupid. 3. C.J. was smart enough to develop a brilliant plot involving a fake interview that earned him a journalism award, but so dumb he gives his girlfriend a copy so that she could later make the connection between his fake story and the murder. Take these mistakes, throw in some poor acting and a totally unnecessary car chase and you have "Beyond a Reasonable Doubt." Better yet, don't watch the movie in the first place, and save yourself an hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor on Many Levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So having watched this I can't help but feel that this could have been so much more. The story is engaging enough (if a little obvious) and does offer some suspense. However it's badly let down by poor performances, poor production and some obvious plot twists. I was particularly let down by Michael Douglas' performance. It has him going through the motions for much of the film. Jesse Metcalf is completely unconvincing as the lead character. You don't feel his character is in any way authentic and simply don't care about him. Some of the other minor performances are heavily stereotyped and particularly bad to the point where they ruin important scenes (the overly camp witness who owns the Jack Russell, the anti social computer geeks who help uncover the doctored photographic evidence). If you were like me you were just waiting for Corey (Joel Moore) to be killed meaning the conviction of CJ would be inevitable (yaaawn). Lets not get into the poor camera work and appalling mucic score played throughout. The film even employs a poor "deus ex machina" to rescue the hapless Ella (Amber Tamblyn) from being killed, after she discovers the truth. While we are on that scene....... when she's hiding from the car behind the concrete pillar you just want to scream "RUN STRAIGHT AHEAD.....IDIOT".I don't want to sound too negative as the film is still watchable and the final plot twist does give some satisfaction. Keep your expectations low and try not to imagine how good this film could have been.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful and exciting judicial thriller full of twists and turns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a deep review of the justice system to reveal faults in its administration , in which a reporter allows himself to be incriminated in a killing . It is a remake of the 1956 film noir film "Beyond a Reasonable Doubt" in which a writer's plan to expose a corrupt district attorney takes an unexpected turn. It deals with a young journalist (Jesse Metcalf) aided by his colleague (Joel Moore) conspires to frame himself in the murder of a woman as part of a effort to uncover a corrupt prosecutor . Reporter sets himself up to take murder rap to show the errors of circumstantial evidence and discredit (D.A.) District Attorney (Michael Douglas who also starred other judicial thriller for Peter Hyams titled Star Chamber) . With a friend holding back evidence so he can prove his innocence at the last minute, he goes to trial . But during the trial , the one man who can exonerate him gets problems and things go awry . The journalist is unable to prove himself innocent later on .This interesting film contains judicial thriller , intrigue , plot twists , suspense and some far-fetched elements including plausible events . This is a real critical on the American justice system ; as this tale develops , a variety of submerged elements slowly surfaces to make this picture far more one of intrigue . The screenwriter has created a story that is thought-provoking and quite predictable and it works a treat in that it gets you thinking about the fact that with this kind of law ; someone really could be framed for something they didn't do . Intriguing idea sometimes doesn't hold up because of several twists and turns . The picture results to be a remake from classic film (1956) by Fritz Lang ¨Beyond a reasonable doubt¨, a brilliant and masterly exposition of American justice as part of an effort to ban capital punishment and in which Lang gets a first-hand view of Justice system , being starred by Dana Andrews , Joan Fontaine , Barbara Nichols and Sidney Blackmer . Acceptable acting from protagonist trio , as Jesse Metcalf as a young reporter who pretends to be guilty of a murder to get first-hand view of corruption , enjoyable Amber Tamblyn as his girlfriend as well as prosecutor assistant and Michael Douglas as a nasty D.A. Thrilling and atmospheric musical score by David Shire . Functional and dark cinematography by the same director , Peter Hyams , who usually is in charge of his owns photography labors . This thrilling motion picture was finely photographed and compellingly directed by Peter Hyams , though with no originality . However it results to be an inferior remake of its predecessor, a noir classic directed by Fritz Lang . Peter Hyams is an irregular director with hits (Relic, End of days, Outland, Capricorn one) and flops (Sound and thunder, The Muskeeter , Stay tuned) . Rating : acceptable and passable thriller . The flick will appeal to Michael Douglas fans .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pity - It Could Have Been So Much Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many little thing about this film just kept pulling it down into the "B" film category.The silly car chase where you knew exactly what was going to happen, the DA's policeman friend, Lieutenant Merchant, whose character was so totally over the top. And yet it had Michael Douglas in it, so you thought "Well, this has to be good, surely?".Unfortunately, not. The main character, C.J. Nicholas's, strange partner Corey Finley who drove too fast and said weird things, the silly old woman in the bank, the odd couple digital photography guys who were simply unreal. Who made up these characters? Such a shame - it should have been a good film. Michael Douglas was pretty scary and acted as well as the mediocre script allowed him to. But overall, it just missed it's mark. Even at the very end, the very last words spoken in the film by Ella Crystal were simply, silly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doubtful quality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once more,a remake of a Film Noir which was crying to be left alone."Beyond a reasonable doubt" which was Fritz Lang's final (and brilliant ) American movie has always been one of my favorites of the director ,perhaps my favorite of his American career along with "you only live once " and "fury".To write that I was eagerly waiting for Peter Hyams ' remake would be exaggerated .But I was curious enough to have a watch.It's moderately entertaining ,with full of filler (Russ Tamblyn's daughter chased by a car) ,bad acting (except for Michael Douglas who was given a role worthy of a cartoon villain) and little suspense ,particularly if you know the final unexpected twist.Lang's black and white gem was something like a Greek tragedy ,with immanent justice .We never feel that the hero is in jeopardy in the remake ,the scenes of the false clues seem like a game for big boys . Lang wanted to express his disgust for death penalty (reductio ad absurdum) and for the last time to show that any man is a potential criminal.Here ,we have the good guy ( good because he wants to hit the big time,to win the Pulitzer) fighting the evil prosecutor .And to crown it all, the journalist's girlfriend works for his enemy ;an enemy so powerful he does not shrink from crime .In Lang's screenplay ,Sidney Blackmer dies in a car accident, period.The Dana Andrews/Joan Fontaine relationship was much more complex than it appeared : she was devoid of sex appeal (or Lang showed her so),often all dressed in black ,displaying no passion ;in direct contrast to that ,the good time girls her fiancé met ;whereas Barbara Nichols was cupid and crude,Fontaine looked almost frigid.The new screenplay oversimplifies all that and opts for the young beautiful couple with good prospects .Lang's screenplay was sometimes criticized for its implausibilities ;but the remake is worse for that matter.Many scenes are pathetic : the "coffee test" ,the two unbearable soon-to-be-doctors-of -computing,Michael Douglas scoffing at the prisoner in chains ,the chase in the parking lot,not to mention the "first cousin" episode.The only real good idea is the journalist's video and the idea that that poor mother's life is as important as any of ours.Peter Hyams was responsible for "2010" a disastrous "2001" sequel;he's better at doing movies of his very own,like "the star chambers"(also starring Douglas).Please take my advice :do watch Lang's black and white gem ;80 min only,beginning with a man walking on the death row ,and ending with a sinister telephone ring :the bell is tolling again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average at best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a little concerned at the IMDb rating of 5.7 for Beyond a Reasonable Doubt so I kept my expectations pretty low.Unfortunately I still found it a disappointment. The first thing that struck me was how poor the casting was (except Douglas we will get to him later). Jesse Metcalfe overacted most of the time, and when he wasn't being frantic and over the top Amber Tamblyn would come in and deliver completely flat lines. I found Joel Moore to be an unusual choice, I think his awkwardness is best suited to comedies.It wasn't all their fault though, most of the dialogue was terrible; C.Js attempt at being funny felt forced and Ellas last line in the film made me cringe it was so pathetic. All of this was hinged on a very implausible plot that was crammed with the usual clichés. The twist at the end had the potential of surprising the audience and redeeming some of the lesser qualities of this film, but it ended up contributing to the implausibility even more.Michael Douglas was this films only redeeming feature and unfortunately he takes up very little screen time. The way he delivers his lines really shows how great an actor he is compared to the rest of the cast (Jesse Metcalfe in particular). As a viewer you identify more with Mark Hunter than you do with C.J or Ella. Their link is vital for the plot to work but there just isn't anything between them and instead of rooting for our underdog I actually wanted Mark Hunter to get away with it.My final gripe with this film is the editing and cinematography. There are some cuts when the characters are talking that really throws the viewer off. Lots of fast edits from wide shots to mid shots for no apparent reason, there were a couple of jump cuts when C.J was talking to Joel that just looked like mistakes. Then there is the lighting, something you shouldn't really notice because it should be part of the mood. But often characters faces or certain scenes would be in complete shadow. Apparently C.Js boss at the news station works in a dark room. It didn't feel like film noir, it just felt like badly lit subjects.If you do decide to watch this film be prepared to roll your eyes every 5 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only Douglas Worth a Look, Rest a Waste of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Hyams's 2009 remake of "Beyond a Reasonable Doubt" has a low-budget amateurish air, that is only underscored by the mediocre cinematography and the inept performances of the two leads. Restless from conducting coffee taste comparisons, an ambitious investigative reporter suspects that the District Attorney is planting last-minute DNA evidence to win an unbroken string of convictions. With information taken from the DA's office by a willing young assistant and the help of his buddy and co-worker, the reporter frames himself for a murder. He intends to reveal the corrupt District Attorney when the manufactured evidence is introduced into his trial. Jaws will drop at the ridiculous proposal, which is intended to win a Pulitzer, and at the ease of gaining access to confidential information. Heads will shake in disbelief as the reporter openly queries a police officer about the murderer's shoes, clothing, injuries, and weapon and then proceeds to purchase all the required circumstantial evidence to implicate himself. That the police, the judge, the jury, or the viewers are gullible enough to swallow this nonsense is pure fantasy.Fritz Lang directed the 1956 original of the same title with a cast that included Dana Andrews and Joan Fontaine; however, that earlier decade was a period when purely circumstantial evidence could convict the innocent. Today, modern forensics, DNA testing, and social media have reduced the odds of wrongful convictions, especially with evidence as trumped up as the remake suggests. While the murder trial was in progress, Facebook alone would have turned up witnesses to the reporter's purchases and whereabouts, and any episode of CSI shows what forensics can accomplish.Like a fresh-faced Boy Scout rather than an ambition-driven reporter, hunky Jesse Metcalfe is out of his depth in a shallow role. His unconvincing love interest, Amber Tamblyn, has a passing resemblance to the young Diane Keaton, but in looks only, not in talent. Only Michael Douglas retains his dignity; as the ruthless DA intent on a governorship, Douglas plays these smooth villains as though born to them. His effortless performance is all the more sterling in comparison to the non-support he receives from Metcalfe and Tamblyn. Joel David Moore as Metcalfe's sidekick brings some life and humor to a thankless role.In today's world of DNA testing, Photoshop manipulation, social media awareness, and police forensics, Peter Hyams's reworked script is incredulous and beyond absurd. To coin a phrase, the plot has more holes than Swiss cheese. Nothing and nobody is believable. A gratuitous, poorly filmed car chase does little but help extend the film's running time 25 minutes beyond that of the original and create a plot twist. Yet another "solitary woman alone in an empty parking garage" scene will elicit groans; DA assistants should see more movies to avoid these clichéd situations. Any defense attorney with a correspondence-school education could locate witnesses and evidence to prove his client was faking. Any judge worthy of sitting on the bench would wince at a lengthy string of last-minute DNA introductions. Any jury told to convict only if the evidence is "beyond a reasonable doubt" would throw up their hands. Any competent District Attorney worth his salary and certainly one as experienced and ruthless as Douglas would immediately see that he was being set up. Even a professional performance from Douglas fails to save this laughable misfire; viewers should save their time and check out the original instead; perhaps Lang, Andrews, and Fontaine made the unbelievable credible .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Remake Turned Into A Missed Opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beyond a Reasonable Doubt is a remake of the 1956 film of the same title by Fritz Lang. The new version features Jesse Metcalfe,Amber Tamblyn,Joel Moore,Orlando Jones and Michael Douglas.Written, directed and filmed by Peter Hyams,it is about a high-profile criminal lawyer finds his bid for the governorship in jeopardy when an ambitious rookie journalist begins suspecting him of tampering with evidence in order to secure his many convictions.Mark Hunter has a reputation for putting criminals behind bars, and with elections approaching he seems a shoo-in for governor. But just how clean is the district attorney's record when held up to scrutiny? When hungry reporter C.J. Nicholas frames himself as a murder suspect in hopes of catching Hunter in the act, the two fierce rivals become caught up in a treacherous game of cat and mouse. But Assistant DA Ella Crystal has no idea about her boyfriend C.J.'s latest assignment, and as the evidence against both men begins to pile up she starts to suspect that she's in mortal danger -- and she's right. Now, as Ella discovers irrefutable proof of both C.J.'s innocence and her boss' shady dealings, the fate of two men rests in the hands of one woman whose life could be taken at any second.It could have been a great movie with an interesting premise and great elements for a crime thriller as well as a brilliant cast.However,it suffers from poor writing as it fails the screenwriter fails to update the tension and suspense to present-day audience.What turns out to be a would-be classic finds itself into a disaster of being a missed opportunities as it finds itself into numerous clichés and predictable elements to the point that it would insult the intelligence of the viewer. In the end,this remake is a missed opportunity as compared to the 1956 version which was a classic during its period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So, so... and not believable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>********* SPOILERS **********I thought this film was acceptable. Since the date-time information that the DVD served as digital backup of was easy to procure by other means, what was the importance of the DVD? The receipts for the articles - the knife, mask, shoes, clothes, dog, etc., or testimony from any of the counter-persons involved could corroborate the times of purchase. But, even added to the the DVD, would this have been a legal defense? Even with the buddy's testimony that this was planned beforehand, wouldn't that have been insufficient evidence by evidentiary standards? Because in the end we know it wasn't enough for the truth. Substantial plot flaw, I thought. And in the end, the assistant D.A. was a better investigator than the investigative reporter.There were other parts of the movie involving the prison stay were a bit unbelievable and unnecessary, but the the DVD was the worst.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unreasonable doubt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a drab paint-by-numbers thriller. As other commenters have noted it's like a made for TV movie from the 80s. A TV reporter (Metcalf) is convinced that the local Louisiana DA has been planting evidence in order to win murder cases. So to expose the evil DA and have a great story to advance his career the reporter hatches a plan of such alarming stupidity that the audience can't possibly identify with him. Here it is: he'll wait for another unsolved murder to be committed and then he'll fake evidence that implicates himself, then, when he's put on trial for the murder he didn't commit, the crooked DA will fabricate evidence and he'll reveal how he implicated himself and show how the DA tried to frame him. Do you get it? He plans to frame himself in order to give the DA an opportunity to frame him. Then he'll expose the DA and have a super story for the TV news. Now in about 10 seconds any reasonable, intelligent person can think of 100 ways such a plan could go wrong. I won't tell you how the young man's scheme goes wrong except it's bound to be one of the ways you already thought of. But I don't advise you wait around to find out which one. The acting, the dialogue and the pacing are just so bad it's no fun to watch at all. Metcalf is wooden actor and he appears at least as dumb as the plot he concocts. You almost hope he gets executed just for trying to pull such a ridiculous stunt.He gets a girl involved (Amber Tamblyn) and though she's a better actor than Metcalf, you don't care for her either because she's dumb enough to stick by our mentally challenged hero. Only the most unlikely turns of fate and happy accidents save him from almost certain death. In one scene in order to recuse the poor sap his girlfriend has to get involved in the computer geek world. But the geeks she consults are such cartoonish stereotypes you don't believe them. They might work as super nerds in a slapstick comedy but not in a serious thriller. When I rented this movie I was hoping that there would be some tense courtroom drama, but I was disappointed. The courtroom scenes are brief and perfunctory. Raymond Chandler, who was hired to write a script for "Strangers on a Train," commented that the plot of "Strangers" is absurd and it takes tremendous skill for a writer/filmmaker to get the audience to believe it. Hitchcock had a way of making his audience believe some pretty absurd things. Director Hyams is no HItchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Beyond a Reasonable Doubt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had thought RKO Pictures was already defunct, but it's quite telling that a film from its archives got pulled out for a remake, and although not having seen the original film in the 50s directed by Fritz Lang no less, this remake had the that similar promising premise which soon gave way to ridiculousness. Suffice to say that without the twist element, it's no better than a standard, average courtroom drama cum investigative thriller that already laid out its cards and was just going through its motion to the finale. Assault on the justice system this is not to be.Since Michael Douglas' name got a bigger font size on the poster, let's start with his character, the District Attorney Mark Hunter who is one case away from sealing his man made destiny to become governor. He's quite the confident schmuck who can mesmerize any jury and his straight convictions of the accused through circumstantial and DNA evidence, raises the suspicion of investigative journalist C.J. Nicholas (Jesse Metcalfe of Desperate Housewives fame), whose research seem to point to Hunter artificially engineering evidence in his favour.An audacious plan gets concocted, and for the sake of a Pulitzer prize, C.J. and career pal Corey (Joel Moore) decide to entrap Hunter into using his deceiving tactics against them in a real murder which they will engineer the circumstantial evidence to point towards C.J., though I wonder if the quest to become famous and climb that corporate ladder would warrant something as risky as this, and what more, the lack of purposeful planning, which allows you the audience to stay one step ahead into just what would happen next.The second half of the movie then shifts its attention to Amber Tamblyn's Ella, while being the assistant to Mark Hunter, gets romantically involved with C.J. and decides to do a little probing herself, which of course led to her being a target. The rest I'm sure you can pretty much guess for yourself, as this just floats like a buoy in calm waters, not being the investigative thriller it can be, but something that's really, really bland and stands out like an amateur hack job.Give it a go if you must, but don't expect anything spectacular. The obligatory action sequences all seemed too contrived, boring and pretty much illogical, such as the taunting of someone using a car. I have to admit though that the final words uttered here was quite a ballsy way to end a story, although it can also mean the same words directed at the unsuspecting audience member who didn't come expecting B-movie through and through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why would a man frame himself... for murder?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beyond a Reasonable Doubt is directed by Peter Hyams and Hyams adapts the screenplay from Douglas Morrow's story/screenplay for the 1956 film of the same name. It stars Jesse Metcalfe, Amber Tamblyn, Michael Douglas, Joel David Moore and Orlando Jones. Music is by David Shire and Hyams also tackles cinematography duties.C.J. Nicholas (Metcalfe) is a journalist aiming for high things. He is convinced that high profile lawyer Mark Hunter (Douglas) is corrupting legal issues and sets about proving it...The 1956 film was the great Fritz Lang's last American film, more court drama than being overtly film noir, it was a film well tuned into legalities of its time. Hyams here updates to a modern era setting and it is fanciful - due to the advancements in technology - in the extreme. Of course those things can often be forgivable if the film is well put together and holds some thriller/drama weight.The look of the film is cheap, as in a TV movie look, with the cinematography uninspiring, the young cast members hardly turn in characterisations to care for, while Douglas (who is very good) is surprisingly under used. The story is a fascinating one as per human foibles, and there's a double whammy stroll down twister street that lifts the film to a rewarding closure. But it's still a disappointment, and this even if you haven't seen Lang's far superior 56 film. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It comes down to budget, and this stinker must not have had it. Oh...I guess on a lazy Sunday afternoon it's worth the watch, but it's not a movie to get excited about. I agree with fellow previewers, it's a GREAT premise for a movie: an ambitious reporter with a knack for obtaining the inside scoop (see the masters - Redford and Hoffman in "All the Presidents men", an AWESOME movie of this genre) frames himself for a murder in order to bring down a too-good-to-be-true prosecutor who is a blue chip for governor. I mean, you'd presumably have to make this movie with an ensemble of 'dropped out of school half-way' mimes to screw it up, right? Nope. They scored Douglas, who is as charming and effective as ever, but the budget for actors ended there. The rest make valiant efforts butt fall short. Acting is stiff and rehearsed; the dialog comes way too fast, as if the actors can't wait to spit their lines out. The back and forth scenes between CJ and Ella are cliché and predictable, and there is no nuance of method acting - just memorized lines delivered in a monotone, boring fashion. Meanwhile, there a lot of goofs, and the cast and director fail to bring it all home. Consider the following cast: Chris cooper as the editor (would be a cameo but it might have worked), Josh Hartnett or even better Ryan Gosling as C.J., Claire Danes or Cate Blanchett as Ella, any of these insertions would have propped this picture up considerably. In my opinion, had I been the studio exec with rights to a movie premise so promising, I'd have kept saving pennies until an adequate cast could be assembled. Watchable but not in my top 150-200 of all time.</fullReview>

The other talent are all television names, Peter Hyams is a C-rate writer/director - this could never have been anything but a C project at best (as it is, it's a D effort).Jesse Metcalfe has never been much of an actor, and does nothing here to prove otherwise. Joel Moore and Amber Tamblyn can act, but don't have the skills to rise above the dreadful script. Many years and bad movies have gone by since Hyams' one decent effort, "The Presidio."So why did Michael Douglas take it? Did he need the money that badly?

This movie was so carelessly directed and produced that in the end I just felt insulted. The "death row" scene lighting was so bad that that the actors were green with pale purple lips. Did they even white-balance the camera, let alone color-correct it in post? And what's with the (lack of) lighting in Sewell Whitney's office? If the reflections in the glass were that much of a problem, remove the glass panes! Or didn't the budget of $25 mil have anything left over after paying for Michael Douglas? This garbage should be shown in film class as a classic example of why you shouldn't try to do everything yourself, since Peter Hyams apparently thought he could write, direct, work the camera, and produce. And no, he can't, on all accounts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely no doubt how awful this is!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of a 50s movie of the same name, which apparently though fairly implausible, was at least suspenseful and vaguely thrilling, unlike this torpid effort. That it was directed by Peter Hyams is incomprehensible, as the man has made some pretty good movies in his time, (Capricorn One for example), and though partial to remakes, has had success with some of these as well, (see Outland, a sci-fi remake of High Noon). But I think he must have been either drunk, or under duress when he made this, as from the start it looks and feels like a TV movie; and not even roping in his old colleague, Michael Douglas, can elevate it from this. The production feels cheap, it's sloppily directed, and edited atrociously. The music sounds like it was scored by a student, (of Theoretical Physics), and the lead character is played by the Desperate Housewives resident topless tottie, Jesse Metcalfe, who is only convincing in making us realise why he was destined to remain on TV! I have to admit I only wasted 40 minutes of my life on it! The plot was glaringly obvious from an early point, where Hyams has the camera linger for so long on the tattooed fingers of the supposedly dead subject of Metcalfe's award winning documentary, that even George W. Bush could have worked out it was going to be relevant to a plot "twist" later! So after I couldn't take any more pain, I jumped to the end of the movie to check if it panned out the way I thought it was going to, and was so glad I did, as it was indeed that tritely obvious! And when the female lead speaks the final cheesy line of the movie, you unfortunately feel like it's the director directly addressing you, as she turns to the camera and says "Fuck you"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not having seen the 50s original, I didn't know what to expect from this film?but being a fan of Michael Douglas and court thrillers, I gave it a go.The film is entertaining, with a likable cast of young actors in Jesse Metcalfe and Amber Tambyln. It is also, in places, predictable and implausible.To suspend our disbelief that a journalist would willingly implicate themselves in a crime would involve a highly personal reason?that he does have a connection to the crime is only revealed in th closing moments. It can be as over the top as you like, but we must believe it as an audience.The film also has some clumsy sequencing and poor music/sound that destroys a lot of the tension. By the midpoint, the lead has made so many poor decisions as a seemingly intelligent character, that we may not care whether he wins or not.The twist ending was as contrived as the rest of the plot and, while effective, did not have the chilling resonance it might have had if we were more emotionally connected to the characters.Finally, if as a film maker you have access to a talent as extraordinary as Michael Douglas, even if he not the lead, make sure that you every scene with him in it lifts the tension and advances the plot. The final confrontation between Mark Hunter (Douglas), as antagonist, and CJ (Metcalfe) in prison was flat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Hyams may not be the most respected director in the game, but I've enjoyed several of his movies in the past none the less. I've also always liked Michael Douglas as an actor, and I've always had a soft spot for courtroom dramas. This is actually not the first time these three ingredients have been mixed up in a movie. In 1983 Michael Douglas starred in Peter Hyams' The Star Chamber, where he plays a judge tired of seeing guilty people run around free due to technicalities rendering damning evidence inadmissible after the law. In retrospect I should have just stuck with that, and given this one a pass. But finding it in the bargain bin it was hard not checking it out.A reporter who've followed the cases of the district attorney (Michael Douglas) for some time suspects the D.A.'s perfect track record to be a lie, and that the D.A. in several of the cases have manufactured the damning evidence, in the form of DNA evidence pointing to the man on trial, planted several days after the crime. His editor doesn't believe him, so with the help of a friend he sets out on a potentially dangerous mission; the next time a murder is discovered, he'll plant circumstantial evidence (sans DNA) pointing to himself, having the friend video tape it in order to destroy the D.A.'s case at the point he knows for sure that he has planted DNA evidence against him. In the mix is also a female lawyer from the D.A.'s office, who becomes romantically involved with the reporter.The premise sounds promising enough. And sure enough, it's a remake of a 1956 movie by the same name, helmed by Fritz Lang, who if you ask me is responsible for the greatest movie ever made; Metropolis, as well as a steady stream of other masterpieces. The best thing I can say about this version of the movie is that it made me aware of the original, and made me want to see it. When I bought it I was unaware of the original's existence.As many others have pointed out before, this version of the movie is full of plot holes, some harder to ignore than others. The flow of the movie is extremely streamlined and predictable, and with the exception of Michael Douglas, who has a much smaller part than I had hoped, no one really delivers any good acting performances either. Douglas isn't really very remarkable in this movie either, but I'd bet that even at his worst it would be obvious he's in a different league than the rest of the cast, and here he isn't even at his worst... The movie looks dark on dull, and has limited production values. I can certainly understand the poor reputation and user score that made me skeptical to the movie to begin with. In fact, I'm surprised it isn't rated even lower.Not having seen the original yet I think it's still safe to say; stick with the original. I'll certainly be checking it out. After all, the premise does have promise, if it's executed correctly and have reasonable explanations for its plot holes. This movie doesn't even try to explain any of them...</fullReview>

Biker Gun Dealer: "It gets snot on it."I'm watching the movie right now...I don't see it getting any better.

		<fullReview>DA Mark Hunter (Michael Douglas) has an impressive record. Maybe it's too impressive. C.J. Nicholas (Jesse Metcalfe) is a young reporter trying to investigate the DA. He's sleeping with assistant DA Ella Crystal (Amber Tamblyn), and decides on a sting to set up Hunter. He sets up some evidence to lure Hunter to frame him for a murder. Hunter smells a set up and kills CJ's friend Corey Finley (Joel David Moore) who was holding the evidence to vindicate him.The problem with this movie is that it's so illogical. I'm not sure any of the evidence would actually vindicate CJ. And it seems more reasonable to have multiple copies leaving at least one with his lawyer. It was going alright until Corey Finley driving like a maniac. It makes no sense. In fact, it was REALLY REALLY stupid. It's an excuse to have a car chase to artificially jack up the excitement. The problem is that it did the exact opposite and jack up the stupidity.It's a remake of Fritz Lang's 1956 movie. I've never seen the original. I can guess with older technology, the story could be more convincing. If they lost a document back then, they could really lose a document. It occurs to me that the best evidence for his innocence is a rock solid alibi. I doubt the CD held any such alibi.While Jesse Metcalfe and Amber Tamblyn have been lambasted here, I'm not willing to pile on any of the blame. They do a decent job. It's not their fault that the story is written with so many plot holes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original, directed by Fritz Lang and released in 1956, was no masterpiece and neither is this. It holds the interest, it's not terrible, but it shows a lack of divine spark in every aspect of its being. If this were an animation of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, those two fingertips would never touch.A journalist (Metcalfe) decides to expose a corrupt District Attorney (Douglas) by picking an unimportant murder and framing himself for the crime through gathering circumstantial evidence, then waiting for the DA to plant DNA evidence to convict him. He looks into the murder of a nobody, then buys incriminating items like a pair of uncommon sneakers that fit those of the murderer, a pair of sweats similar to those of the perp, and so on. He has himself filmed by a journalist friend as he goes about framing himself. The DNA evidence that he expects the DA to plant is only the clincher to his conviction. When he draws the attention of the police to his ownership of the rare sneakers, he is duly arrested and charged with murder.Douglas, the miscreant DA, produces the fabricated DNA but, having learned of Metcalfe's scheme, sees to it that Metcalfe's friend dies in a flaming car accident while carrying all the evidence that would free Metcalfe.It's a nice set up for a suspense movie. I'm leaving out the twist at the end that would have made it a suitable candidate for "Alfred Hitchcock Presents." And it generally works too. We can get into Metcalfe's sweaty desperation as he is condemned to death and paces around in his cell.But it isn't the taut tale that the original was. It's been "updated." That means more profanity, which doesn't bother me a bit. But it also means that there must be a frantic car chase through the streets of Shreveport. The speeding car chase is de rigeur. If it doesn't have a speeding car chase that ends in an exploding fireball, it ain't a movie. That it's updated also means that there are some sex scenes, which is also okay with me. But that the DA is actually corrupt is, I believe, also part of the updating. In the original, the DA was straight.This reflects a shift in the public's conception of the judicial system. In Stage I (with, as always, many exceptions) the law was always just, though sometimes misled. (Eg., "Boomerang.") This Stage lasted through 1956 into the 1960s, when Stage II emerged. In Stage II, the defendant, often a member of a minority group, tended to be railroaded by a corrupt system. (Eg., "In The Heat Of The Night.") This 2009 update reflects our current values in Stage III -- both the defendant and the justice system are duplicit. Everything is rotten.The original may not have been a cinematic gem but it was well done. Here, the bare skeleton of the tale manages to hold things together, but almost everything about the movie is deficient. The acting, for instance, is pretty poor. Even Michael Douglas seems to be walking through his part. He's lost the verve he had as Gordon Gekko. He's a sneaky, ambitious DA who is about to run for governor and he seems half asleep. Metcalfe and his girl friend are handsome enough, I guess, but belong on television.The lack of talent, the mistakes in casting and direction, extend down through the bit parts. The judge in the case is embarrassing. Even the extras are at a loss. Check out the corrections officer who monitors Metcalfe's phone call from the prison. The poor guy has been told to stand at parade rest and, so as not to resemble a monument, to look from side to side once in a while. Compare the management of small roles in an imaginative film like the Coen brothers' "No Country For Old Men." The direction is by Peter Hyams whose obvious niche is routine commercial projects. No cliché is too obvious to be avoided. When a young woman is being chase through an empty parking lot by a car with murderous intent, she runs down the center of the lane instead of dodging sideways into one of the recesses in the wall.Well, as I say, it's not atrocious. It's simply mediocre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Push The Jury Into Conviction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably those who have seen and reviewed this new version of Beyond A Reasonable Doubt already know how this will play out and the suspense is killed. It certainly was that way for me.The 2009 Beyond A Reasonable Doubt has one thing to recommend it beyond the 1956 one. In that first one it was as an academic exercise that Dana Andrews put himself in harm's way, getting himself convicted of murder and then trying to free himself. In this one ambitious investigative reporter Jesse Metcalf has trained his sites on the District Attorney in Shreveport, Louisiana where this is filmed. Michael Douglas has been winning a whole lot of cases on the strength of DNA evidence offhandedly found at crime scenes. His winning streak has people looking at him to be the next governor of Louisiana.To get his story Metcalf has himself framed for the murder of a junkie prostitute and plants evidence that lead the Shreveport cops right to him. Sure enough planted DNA evidence shows up to push the jury into conviction. Now to get his story, but some unforeseen complications do arise which if you've seen the 1956 version you have some idea what they are.Amber Tamblyn in an adult role does a fine job as Metcalf's girlfriend and one who works in the District Attorney's office. I saw a lot of traces of Michael Douglas's father in his performance, more than I normally catch when watching this film. Best supporting role is that of Joel David Moore as Metcalf's luckless cameraman who is the only other one who knows what Metcalf is trying to do.What this version of Beyond A Reasonable Doubt missed the most was the tension building direction of Fritz Lang. That was something that could not be replaced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, I love courtroom dramas. In movies and books. Also, I'm a huge Michael Douglas fan. Furthermore, Metcalfe is extreme eye-candy. So why was Beyond a Reasonable Doubt sooo?amateurish? There's probably many reasons. Even though it's not based on a John Grisham novel/idea, it's as if Grisham was either drunk or was having a really bad year and thought of this idea. So, even the worst of Grisham's books/movies was 10x better than this mess. Douglas seriously was only looking for a paycheck or was just coaxed into starring and putting his name on top for sales ? either way, or both, it failed, financially. In addition, the dialogue and clichéd characters are just plain awful. And the "surprise twist" ending was seen from the opening 20 minutes. Before you criticize this part by saying what I hear a lot: "Oh, just sit back and enjoy the movie ? stop trying to guess the ending!" Uh, they're marketing and writing this as a "mystery" so they're, literally begging us to try and outsmart the 14-year-olds who wrote this.C.J. (Metcalfe) is trying to make a name for himself in the new media and his big break would be to bring down D.A./Governor-to-be Mark Hunter (Douglas) for planting evidence to win cases. C.J.'s brilliant idea is to find a murder and set himself up as the killer. Once the evidence is planted against him, he would spring the trap on Hunter and?everything?would?be?just?fine. But, will it? Duh.Amongst all the other problems of the movie, a major one involves the timeframes. Sure, the movie was set to be under two hours so they kinda sped this process up, but in reality ? something, I'm assuming the movie's asking us to believe its set in, this would take months, if not years. C.J. makes it not only seem like a slam dunk, Pulitzer Prize winning article, but a quick conviction of Hunter.Another issue I had, and coincidentally I just wrote another review (Extract) with this complaint, was the wasted talent. Douglas should absolutely know better. Not all of his movies are five stars, but he has picked quite a few great ones. He has no excuse. But Metcalfe, in his best Tom Cruise imitation here, shouldn't be wasting any time or (his little bit of acting) talent here. According to what I've read, since I have yet to meet him, he bases a lot of his screen presence on his looks. His looks won't last forever, so, please pick better scripts. And then you'll get more notice as well as the ability to grow as an actor.I'm awarding this the lowest award ? 1 star. Though it won't be on my all time worst top-ten lists, I simply cannot find a redeemable quality from this movie. A movie that feels sooo student film project.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dopey crime drama, very amusing though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The career of director/cinematographer Peter Hyams has been one of slow decent into mediocrity like Beyond a Reasonable Doubt, which has just a slight improvement over his previous entry A Sound of Thunder. This movie is arguably the dopiest courtroom drama of the decade (at least). It is a story that lives purely on coincidence and contrivance. It feels rushed and ends on an anti-climactic note. Sounds pretty bad huh? Actually it wasn't. There is something kind of amusing about the idiocy of Beyond a Reasonable Doubt which may be just enough to keep you watching. Sometimes it gets actually fairly tense. C. J. Nicholas is an investigative reporter in Missouri who is convinced that the district attorney, has been faking evidence for the last 17 murder cases he has taken on. In order to expose him, C. J. comes up with a crazy scheme which involves framing himself for a murder, getting arrested and hoping that Nicholas tries to pin something on him. Sounds good, but something goes very wrong.Not for a moment is the story believable, and it takes too many ways out of conflict, including rushing scenes, throwing in cheap surprises, and also a deus ex machina to conclude the whole thing. If you are not bothered by this, you may find something to salvage from Beyond a Reasonable Doubt. There are some quirky scenes here and there and a few good Hyams shotsWell, it could have been worse I suppose, the movie was better than I expected, but I think I may be giving it more generosity than it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame and predictable from the start....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Problem#1: Peter Hyams is directing, doing the camera, producing and did write the script (his first since 20 years) and it is lame. The dialogs have been copied and pasted from other movies of the genre. Not a single sentence or word seems unique. Unless you are &lt;18 you have heard it all before. The plot is so predictable that Dr. Watson could figure it out during Sherlock's summer holidays - no drama here. Michael Douglas talent gets wasted. Jesse Metcalfe and Amber Tamblyn should stay in TV. There even seem to be major problems in the editing, because the way certain scenes are cut, doesn't make any sense.Best part of the movie, at least for Linux and Apple users, might be the fact that the bad cop looks like Steve Ballmer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the film tries to be smart, it doesn't go too far in it's attempt since this is slightly similar to other concepts while also being boldly unique. At times you say OK, how stupid etc. but they compensate for it by doing exactly what sensibility tells you they should do. It seems to lack intelligence at times and then catches you by surprise. There's also a decent amount of action and suspense and along with some corny dialog, there is also some really funny and somewhat clever dialog as well. There are a few scenes I think that try to hard or should have been done slightly different. With a little better directing and script polish, this likely would have gotten a theatrical release but, the refinements just aren't there. Overall, still an entertaining movie worth your dollar or time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The classic "Beyond a Reasonable Doubt" from 1956 is a favorite noir of mine, starring Dana Andrews, Joan Fontaine, and Sidney Blackmer, directed by the great Fritz Lang. We describe it as a classic today, but back then, with stars and a director who made their marks in the preceding decades, and filmed in black and white, I don't think it was intended to be a classic. There were none of the Fritz Lang touches, no artful camera work -- in fact, this was Lang's last film.However, it happens to be a fantastic story, one of the best ever, and here it has been updated and changed somewhat for the 2009 film. In fact, it was changed a little too much, and that too much is what spoils it.The original film was an indictment against the death penalty. A novelist sets himself up as a killer so that the fact that he faked all of the evidence can be submitted before his execution, thus proving the system almost murdered the wrong man.In this film, the plot concerns a reporter (Jesse Metcalfe) desiring to prove that a district attorney (Michael Douglas) is falsifying DNA evidence to win convictions.I suppose given the fact that people are on Death Row for sometimes 30 years kind of spoils it as a film plot, but I don't think the plot here served what could have been an exciting update of a great story.Both films have a plot flaw -- the handling of the evidence to clear the reporter -- which could have been easily fixed. Not only is it not fixed in this one, but this movie dug a couple of other holes besides.First, how does a reporter in this day and age not know that jailhouse phone calls are recorded? Has he never seen one episode of Snapped, 20/20, or any true crime show? Worse, how did an attorney not know it?Second, what was that business in the parking garage? Any time you see a woman, at night, going into an empty parking garage, you know her chances of exiting, alive and driving her own car, are not good. Why would a woman who is aware that danger lurks even go into that garage without getting some guy to walk her out? And the attempted murder - please, ever heard of a gun? Third, the handling of the evidence that was to clear Metcalfe. A problem in both films, though in this latter film, the case isn't solved that way, so it just sticks out as being dumb.Still, it's not a bad rental. Amber Tamblyn does an okay job as Metcalfe's love interest, and Michael Douglas is good as the phony, icy DA.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jesse Metcalfe plays C.J. Nicholas, a young and hungry-for-excitement journalist who frames himself for murder in order to expose the evidence-tampering and phony convictions by the corrupt D.A.of Shreveport, LA. Amber Tamblyn plays Ella Crystal, the pretty young Assistant D.A. who suddenly and rather unconvincingly falls in love with Nicholas and enters into a fall-on-her-sword relationship with him. While I'm not personally a huge fan of Michael Douglas's too-cool-for-words acting style, his fans will probably enjoy his performance as the D.A.BEYOND a REASONABLE DOUBT is, of course, a remake of a somewhat better 1956 film by the same title. This version is probably worth seeing if you're a not-too-picky legal thriller fan. It's generally well-filmed and keeps your attention with some nice courtroom drama: Sharon London is a standout here as Judge Sheppard. On further scrutiny, however, it's all quite contrived, and the supposedly big twist at the end is awful sudden and tacked-on.SEMI-SPOILER ALERT! In the end, BRD is a poor rip-off of a much, much better film from 1996, PRIMAL FEAR.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beyond a Reasonable Doubt is a reasonable courtroom/corruption thriller that despite its shortcomings kept me entertained until the credits rolled. Amber Tamblyn and Joel David Mooore are both appear together as they did in the awful movie Spiral and although Moore does quirky again it is not as annoying. Plus his character is bumped off before the half way mark.Comparisons can be made against the 1956 original (which is a good movie itself)and i did not have any issue with the contemporary updates. As in most movies clichés abound and characters make stupid mistakes. The CJ Nicholas character despite his meticulous planning is careless with the evidence DVD solely entrusting it to his journalist college (played by Moore) so that when Moore is murdered the key piece of evidence is lost. Perhaps this can be excused by the arrogant and cocksure personality traits that make up Nichloas' character. Then of course if he proved his case against the corrupt district attorney he does not go to prison and we have one very short movie. The corrupt attorney is played effortlessly by Michael Douglas. He exudes menace without even trying.I disagree with other negative comments posted regarding the direction, editing, quality of acting and movie ending all of which are fine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with most of the negative reviews of this movie. Various writers of these reviews seemed to sense what I found to be the worst feature of this movie, but they didn't quite articulate it. That is, this is a classic example of modern manipulative movie making.Every few days I turn away from all the newer movies being shown on the premium channels and go to TMC to renew my faith in human nature by watching "honest" movies. Oh, those old films from the 40s and 50s had plenty of faults and are often very hard to take. But almost nothing in them is as bad as this audience manipulation!In the last 3 minutes of this flick we are told that this sweet young man is actually a cold blooded murderer, which is utterly out of character with the person we had been watching for the first 98% of the movie. This is the baldest kind of audience manipulation, done for the sake of a cheap thrill (as are the gratuitous car chases in this movie) and by going so counter to human nature destroys any character integrity the movie might have generated earlier. This isn't really a movie at all, but more like a video game.</fullReview>

Wannabe law student CJ (Jesse Metcalfe) comes to think he's concocting evidence to notch up his conviction rate, and spots an opportunity to expose him when another murder case arises, implicating himself and conspiring to reveal the truth when Hunter's supposed corruption comes to light. But his plan backfires and the young stooge finds himself in a deadly battle of wits with the older charge.This has an original, exciting angle to it as a thriller (until you learn it's another remake of another very old film.) Somehow, it never materializes into the sum of it's parts, though, and all plays out in such a workmanlike style that robs it of any genuine tension or suspense. Throw in some wildly implausible twists and turns here and there, and you have a film that is perfectly pitched at it's seeming no show at theatres. It's too well made and acted to be a complete failure , and there's an admittently clever twist at the end. All the same, it's BARD that the original was much better. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fixing, after the Fact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a project for film students: take this film, a loser, and make a great movie from it. I think I would add new footage about the hidden story here (the hooker), present the thing nonlinearly, shift the narrator and the stance of at least two of them and add a new score. We would have to add a lot of situated shots to add texture to the environment so that you cannot be sure that every single thing you see will be an essential clue.I am convinced that this could be an important film because the idea is so well conceived.We have the story the film presents, which I suggests can be repaired after the fact. It will feature a story about a DA who fixes stories after the fact. The details of both of these stories (the ones without and within the film) are that the power of the story is served by artificial enhancement. (The DA enhances his conviction rate by fabricating evidence, proved in photographic images.)So far so good. These stories are carried by a third, another detective, this time an investigative reporter. He is trying to confound and reveal both the DA and the film's viewers by deceiving them. There are details here that mix his confounding of their "artificial" narrative enhancements with one he delivered in a previous movie and which is now threatened. This story is the one that I suggest be enhanced. It references a prostitute which is already in the zone of artificial narrative; this woman has been a co-conspirator in the same way the viewer is tricked into being.There is more: we have a fifth detective (actually a sixth) who unravels everything at the end. She also is an investigator. She also is entrapped in a prostitution of sorts.Pretty good, huh?Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent courtroom thriller! 8!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must mention I like Law and am a fan of thrillers and courtroom movies and novels. I did not see the original version. Also, I have seen most of the movies directed by Peter Hyams and like them all (some more than other, but I really like "Timecop", for example. He is very good at thrillers). I was about to start the Law degree in my town, but finally, decided to start another, in fact. The movie has a very adequate lenght. It is quite short, which makes it enjoyable and amusing. The pace is very good for a dramatic intriguing thriller with a bit of action. Moreover, it contains a few twists that make it worth watching and interesting. Peter Hyams really knows how to direct thrillers of almost all kinds. This movie is very focused on its plot more than in the character development. The cast is good. The most well-known and only famous is Michael Douglas (the best actor in the movie). He delivered a deep and believable performance as a rogue prosecutor. Maybe, he is not the most versatile actor, but he is always believable and has a solid career. The protagonist is played by Jesse Metcalfe, whose career is not so good. This time, he delivered a correct performance as a young reporter struggling to proof the prosecutor is rogue. Joel David Moore, a young quite unknown actor, is also correct as his best friend. Amber Tamblyn has worked in well-known movies even though she is not famous at all. She is more than good as the female sentimental partner of the main character. Moreover, the character has a lot of relevance for the plot. The sceneography is nothing special, the typical for a courtroom thriller in a typical U.S. town. The problem with the movie is that something relevant happens at a given moment and is misunderstood like it were nothing relevant. This is what I disliked the most about the movie, apart from the main actor (he is not bad, but he should have done it better taking into account he is the head character. Maybe, this has been a casting error). In conclusion, Michael Douglas and the plot itself are the strenghts in the movie whereas the main actor's performance and the plothole I am afraid I cannot explain are its defects. Anyway, this is a very enjoyable and solid thriller. I specially recommend it to those that like the courtroom subgenre and both Hyams' and Douglas' fans. 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reporter C J Nicols (Metcalfe) believes District Attorney Mark Hunter (Douglas) gets most of his convictions by planting DNA evidence on the person arrested for the crime. C J has a plan to prove this. This is 2-things. 1: The story is based upon a play and 2: this is a remake of something back in the 1950s. Anyone remember Dana Andrews? Hmmmm???? Just seeing the title should tell all of us that we have seen this before, maybe not back in the 1950s, but somewhere along the line. I mean it's such a good title not to have been used before. We must have seen it. Moving on????..But unlike a talky play, this story does have a good car chase and a car chasing a woman in a parking garage. Can't put all that on a stage. And, this is not too talky. It has just about the right amount of dialogue and it's pretty good too. You keep asking about twists. Yes, there are some. No, I cannot tell you what they are. You don't even know Dana Andrews. Pressing on?????In response to your other questions, yes, there is suspense at times and some tension too. Yes, I know a play can do that. No, actually the music didn't help the suspense or tension as it should have, but they were there nevertheless. Continuing????.Humor. You ask about humor? They didn't laugh back in the 1950s. A drama was a drama unless Humphrey Bogart or Clark Gable.was in it. Then it was both. So no humor in here. Sorry. Onward?????What's that? You say they didn't know about DNA back in the 1950s. Well, then some other type of evidence must have been used to plant on the person arrested for the crime as the original movie must have shown. Have no idea what that was, maybe fingerprints. They did have that back then. Getting late??.I am not sure how this movie compares to the original back in the 1950s, but I am sure I must have seen it somewhere in my life. My God, look at the title again! But, I have seen some things Dana Andrews was in and they were pretty good. Michael Douglas is in this movie and he's pretty good, actually, he's always good (well, except for the King of California thing). Have to go, Judge Judy is on soon????.Yes, the acting by everyone was good. What's that? Who do I think did the best job in here? I'd have to say Joel David Moore as Finley. Could have used a few more scenes that had Michael Douglas in them, but???..hey, I'm not the director. Anything else you want to know?The last line in the movie? Yes, it could have been something else. But, you kids??????Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, some.</fullReview>

Wooden acting would be a compliment for most of the cast. Michael Douglas is his usual self, neither brilliant nor terrible, but it's still not enough to save this movie - he's lucky that his wife's career is steaming along. He has been reduced to the worst of the B-Grade thrillers - although I use the term 'thriller' loosely.Jesse Metcalfe is the least convincing actor in the movie. Should have stuck to being the eye candy on some soap/drama for bored housewives. He failed to convey any of the emotions or tension required for his character. And what's with the Superman haircut??!? The plot, oh the plot. Well done it would still be tedious and predictable, but this is a train-wreck. Long-winded pointless dialog, combined with clumsy attempts to create drama and tension create the impression that this movie was made by a bunch of work-experience students.It's so predictable as to render watching the entire thing unnecessary. Watch the first half, and you already know the rest.I wish I hadn't watched it at all. Do not pay money, or waste hours of your life to see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressed with one particular legal premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here in Louisiana, law enforcement has the ability to obtain warrants with no digital paper trail required (see Orlando Jones as he asks the journalist to sign the search warrant, hence proving the warrant existed at the moment of entry). This lack of paper trail is allowed as per Article 162 of our Code of Criminal Procedure. Couple this with the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court has never ruled that a warrant must be shown in the course of serving it, and the fact that actions can be excused upon being omitted from a warrant application (see State v Barrilleaux, 620 So 2d 1317) and you have a formula for backdating if the incentive exists for such (seized assets, "finding" of contraband, political or personal vendettas).It is most noteworthy that the writers focused on that issue; the uninformed would probably not catch the point. In the year 2011, it is absurd to rely on the signature of some honorable judge-at-the-time, with all his possible financial incentives (seized assets), or rely on the clerk of the same office, when it is so easy to snap and email a copy of the document, save the unsigned document to a word file, or fax the application to the judge. It is also unfair to immediately enshroud this well-utilized technique in the cloak of irreproachable "judicial immunity." But the Orlando Jones character did his job properly, though being a pawn for the corrupt District Attorney.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With Flaws-Beyond a Reasonable Doubt is Reasonably Good ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise is outstanding. A television reporter incriminates himself in a murder so that he can get the goods on a corrupt district attorney. The latter, a supporting role, is played convincingly by Michael Douglas.The reporter gets his wish only to have his friend, who is holding evidence of his being innocent, killed when Douglas realizes what is really going on.It then falls to an Assistant D.A. to get the goods on Douglas. It doesn't hurt that she has become the love interest of our reporter.The picture goes awry after Douglas is discovered to be what he is, only to have our gal discover that our reporter is no choir boy as well.The movie is well paced, exciting and well executed by all concern.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful attorney meets his match.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of Fritz Lang's 1956 thriller; but don't expect the outstanding. High-profile criminal lawyer, Mark Hunter(Michael Douglas), lets his impeccable record of putting bad guys behind bars lead to thoughts of his bid for the governorship. An ambitious small-time journalist, C.J. Nicholas(Jesse Metcalfe), for his own glory begins an investigation to bring Hunter down. The young reporter sets out to prove the attorney tampers with evidence to get his convictions. Assistant DA Ella Crystal(Amber Tamblyn)gets romantically involved with C.J. only to discover that her boss and boyfriend both are masters at shady dealings. The burden of proof takes on a whole new meaning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Adult Role for Amber Tamblyn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I rented this Video to see the developing talent of Amber Tamblyn. I own copies of her two Seasons as 'Joan of Arcadia', Watched her with 3 other Young Co-Stars who have all had their own TV Series in the Two Movies of 'Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants'. Even watched the painfully trivial 'Spring Breakdown', where she is still a Girl dealing with over-protective but well meaning Adults.Finally! Amber Tamblyn gets a truly grown-up role as an Assistant DA, torn between her Boss, Mark Hunter, played by Michael Douglas - and a Scheming Investigative Reporter who Plays Her;(Irresistible Pun). The Reporter, C.J. Nicholas is played by Jesse Metcalf. Of course Amber, as Ella Crystal, falls in love, and in bed with Nicholas, and falls for his proof of innocence as well.All unravels when her keen eye discovers one piece of evidence that reveals more than one lie, Beyond a Reasonable Doubt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so this one won't satisfy the movie snobs... you know the type; amateur critics who refer to every movie as a "FILM", but who actually have no practical expertise or experience in either drama or film-making. Personally, my only concern is that a movie entertain me; it need not be a "work of art" to accomplish that. If I want to see some art, I'll go to the museum; when I'd like to be entertained, I'll watch a movie. And if I want to be entertained beyond what's offered on regular television, a movie would have to be pretty awful to not satisfy that want. Besides, if I ever reach a point where I'm truly that concerned about my cultural intake, I'll read a book. All that said, this one was plenty entertaining. Lots of intrigue and some good, unexpected twists to go along with a little action. While certainly not the best movie I've ever seen, it was definitely worth a watch; and in fact, I'll probably watch it again in the future.In all honesty, I'd probably only give the movie a 7 rating; but in an effort to counteract some of the more absurd ratings previously submitted, and perhaps inspire more viewers to give it a chance and avoid missing out, I gave it an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Somewhat muddled remake of the 1956 Fritz Lange thriller of the same name. The movie has local Shreveport La. investigative reporter C. J Nichloas, Jesse Metcaffe, go beyond the call of duty in trying to get the goods on the local D.A Mark Hunter, Michael Douglas. Over the last two years Hunter has been embellishing his record-through DNA evidence- as a man of and for the people in putting criminals behind bars.Nicholas feels certain that Hunter or someone working for him had been planting DNA evidences at the crime scenes after the crimes were committed. This is in order for Hunter to frame those whom he prosecutes and have them, for the most part, sent to Louisiana's death row. Using himself as bait Nicholas together with his TV news cameraman friend Corey Finley, Joel Moore, Nicholas implicates himself in a murder that he didn't commit! This in Nicholas hoping that Hunter would jump at the bait and plant DNA evidence in order to frame and convict him. Arrested and on trial for his life Nicholas' trump card Corey Finley and the evidence that can clear him end up both dead and burned to a crisps. That's when Corey's car ends up in flames as he was rushing to the courtroom to present evidence to the judge proving that Hunter planted false DNA evidence on Nicholas; Like he did in the other previous cases that he handled that ended with with a conviction.Awaiting execution and with no hope in sight Nicholas' only hope now is his girlfriend Ella Crystal, Amber Tamblyn, who just happens to be Hunter's assistant! Ella had come up with shocking crime scene evidence, tampered photographs, that proves that Nicholas is dead right in his accusations of her boss' Hunter manipulating evidence in cases that he handled!***SPOILERS*** The far biggest shock in the movie "Beyond a Reasonable Doubt" has nothing really to do with Hunter but C.J Nicholas himself! It turns out that Nicholas besides putting his life on the line in the cause of justice isn't beyond putting other lives on the line, or even taking them, in order to farther his career as one of the nations top TV investigative reporter!So-so but not really that great of a crime film with the exception of Michael Douglas' acting, the best by far in the film, and the movie's jaw dropping closing scene that even rivals the closing scene in "Gone With the Wind" between Redd Butler and Scarlet O'Hara! That's when a outraged and feeling taken advantage of Ella Crystal tells boyfriend C.J Nicholas exactly what she thinks of him!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Homage to Fritz Lang's Original "Reasonable Doubt"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Hyams ranks as a talented action director who never astonished Hollywood with a sensational blockbuster. Nevertheless, he has always exhibited a sense of style and he has made some semi-memorable sagas. The best thing about a Hyams movie is usually the snappy sarcasm in his dialogue. Hyams stages his narratives with competence and maintains the momentum from fade-in to fade-out. Typically, he serves as his own director of photography. Indeed, the less-than-mind-boggling sequel to the Stanley Kubrick epic "2001: A Space Odyssey" that he made from the Arthur C. Clarke "2010" novel qualified as a respectable science fiction, but it was neither as enthralling nor philosophically heavy as its predecessor. Hyams made "Running Scared" with Billy Crystal and Gregory Hines about two maverick Chicago cops. Jean-Claude Van Damme made back-to-back actioneers with Hyams named "Sudden Death" and "Timecop." The best movie Hyams helmed was the "High Noon" Sean Connery sci-fi thriller "Outland." Afterward, Connery teamed up again with Hyams on a solid murder thriller set in San Francisco called "The Presidio" that co-starred Mark Harmon. Recently, Hyams made a decent version of "A Sound of Thunder" based on Ray Bradbury's short story, but the film lacked good special effects. Now, Hyams has appropriated the Douglas Morrow screenplay for the 1956 Fritz Lang thriller "Beyond a Reasonable Doubt" about the immorality of the death penalty and updated it with Jessie Metcalfe replacing Dana Andrews and Amber Tamblyn substituting for Joan Fontaine. The Hyams remake sheds the capital punishment theme and aspires less pretentiously to be an edge of the seat suspense yarn about the perfect murder. Michael Douglas, who worked with Hyams on the legal thriller "The Star Chamber," plays the villainous district attorney here rather than the hero, and Douglas gives such a polished performance that he dominates his co-stars in each scene.C.J. Nicholas (Jesse Metcalfe of "Desperate Housewives") is an ambitious investigative television journalist who works at a Shreveport, Louisiana, TV station. He tries to convince his assignments editor that the local district attorney, Mark Hunter (Michael Douglas of "Basic Instinct"), that Hunter has been planting last-minute DNA evidence so he cannot lose a case. Naturally, the news assignments editor is skeptical based on the insubstantial evidence that Nicholas and his videographer, Corey Finley (Joel David Moore of "Avatar"), have gotten from assistant district attorney Ella Crystal (Amber Tamblyn of "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"), who has no idea what Nicholas is planning. Of course, the editor turns them down and informs them that low ratings have forced him to disband the investigative unit that Nicholas was hired for in the first place. Predictably, Nicholas cannot let Hunter get off the hook, so he decides to take the first murder case that comes along and implicate himself for the crime.Meanwhile, Corey and he plan to document the false evidence with a video camera and expose Hunter for the fraud that he is. A prostitute is found murdered, and Nicholas persuades conscientious Shreveport police detective Ben Nickerson (Orlando Jones of "Primeval") to slip him a copy of the crime report. He analyzes the facts and then gathers all the incriminating evidence he needs to get himself arrest. Hunter charges Nicholas with the crime and it appears that Hunter is going to win again. The defense summons Corey to testify because he has digital video evidence of Nicholas buying the rare sneakers that the assailant wore and the switchblade knife that he used. They even rescued a Jack Russell terrier from the dog pound to simulate the dog bite to his left calf.The wily Hunter suspects that he is being set up and Detective Anthony Merchant agrees. Merchant relieves Nickerson from the case and plants the damning evidence. Moreover, he ransacks the Finley apartment and then follows Finley to a local bank where the videographer gets a back-up copy of the video. As Finley races back to the courthouse, Detective Merchant pursues him and Finley dies in an automobile accident, helped in part by Merchant tossing a lit cigarette into the puddle of spilled gasoline around his car. The jury convicts Nicholas despite his revelation about the expose that he was working on about Hunter. Meantime, Nicholas pleads with Ella to help him and she discovers that something is wrong and she takes the evidence to a forensic technician who points out how photographic evidence has been corrupted. Heading out to her car afterward, Ella is terrified when Merchant shows up and tries to kill her in the parking lot.Although he has dispensed with Lang's capital punishment theme, Hyams does a good job with this remake that springs two surprises in the last quarter-hour. The car chase in the parking lot is rather exciting, too. The chief difference between the Lang original and the Hyams remake is that the district attorney in the original did not manipulate with the evidence whereas the Michael Douglas district attorney does tamper with the evidence. Furthermore, the chief detective in Hyam's version is the culprit who actually monkeys with the evidence, whereas his counterpart in the Lang version is sympathetic to the hero. Indeed, this remake of "Beyond A Reasonable Doubt" updates the Fritz Lang original, and Hyams jams it full of excitement. The technological changes and innovations that have occurred since 1956 gives this remake more room to challenge its hero as well as the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Superb Remake....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake of the 1956 noir film with the same name, Peter Hyams directed 'Beyond A Reasonable Doubt' is a superb remake without a shed of doubt.'Beyond A Reasonable Doubt' has tremendous shock value, which makes this thriller a winner all the way. Very surprisingly, this film has not gained any popularity, which is really sad. This film has the potential to keep hooked, but god knows what went wrong! As a Viewer, I am glad I gave this applaud-able attempt a chance.Coming to performances,Michael Douglas is fabulous as the calculative DA. Jesse Metcalfe is first-rate. Amber Tamblyn is very sincere; very good. Joel Moore leaves a mark in a brief role. Others lend able support.on the whole... this thriller has what it takes. The end is sure to leave you awe-struck. Must watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine movie, 10 out of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. I am not gonna describe the plot, everybody can read about it on the main page... I thought this was a great movie. The cast is good, the dialogue is good. I didn't pay much attention to the cinematography or the music because the story got me hooked immediately. My only minor complain is the old movie cliché - we all know one cannot ignite gasoline by throwing a lit cigarette in it - the cigarette simply goes out, but since so many movies have that it is OK I guess. A couple of words about Michael Douglas. While he is not the lead he shines with the light of thousand suns. Watching him on screen feels like watching a fat, lazy shark. Or a snake. Dripping slime. He is confident and calculating, not once does he raise his voice. His performance reminded me of his work in "A perfect murder". Wow, what an actor, he really knows his stuff. If you liked "Fracture" with Anthony Hopkins chances are you are gonna like this too.</fullReview>
