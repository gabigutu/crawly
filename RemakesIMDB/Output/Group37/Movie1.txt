		<shortDescription>Last but by no means least for Lang!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For his final Hollywood film, Fritz Lang decided to expose the pitfalls of capital punishment for circumstantial evidence. For this film, Lang has kept it simple; with the entire movie focusing on the central premise and not a lot of anything else going on. Filmmakers can sometimes saturate a film with lots of sub-plots, and it can have a huge detrimental effect on what the film is trying to achieve. By keeping it simple, Lang gives himself time to fully explore the implications of his plot and the film is made more compelling because of this. The story follows Austin Spencer; a person of stature that is continually campaigning against circumstantial evidence being used as a means to send someone to the electric chair. His efforts are unsuccessful, until he has the bright idea to have a man sent to death row on circumstantial evidence, only to be pardoned at the last minute by means of the evidence to prove his innocence being brought to light. Enter Tom Garrett; Austin's son in law to be, and the man that agrees to frame himself for murder...This is perhaps Lang's best assault on the American justice system; he has created a story that is interesting and very plausible and it works a treat in that it gets you thinking about the fact that with this kind of law; someone really could be killed for something they didn't do. Of course, the chances of someone risking being put to death to expose this are unlikely, but then again; it's only a movie, so you can expect to suspend your belief a little for a point to be made. Beyond a Reasonable Doubt also features one of the most finely tuned plot twists that I've seen in a movie. Lang shows us everything about the plot; from the first ideas, to the setting up, all the way to the trial and because of this; the final twist comes as a complete surprise. It's been done and done a million times since this film, but despite this; Beyond a Reasonable Doubt still has the power to shock the viewer. Beyond a Reasonable Doubt is one of the highlights of Lang's illustrious filmography. It has an unfairly low IMDb rating, and I hope that you will not use that as a means of deciding whether or not to see this film. It is efficient story telling at it's best and this is one of the highlights of the film noir era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as taut as it should have been or as meaningful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Garrett is a writer engaged to the daughter of wealthy newspaper man Austin Spencer. Spencer is also firmly against the death penalty. With Tom looking for a subject for a second novel, Spencer suggests that they set Tom up for an unsolved murder using circumstantial evidence to prove how easy it would be for the courts to kill an innocent man. Once Tom is sentenced to the chair, Spencer will expose the failings in the system and free him. However when Spencer is killed in car crash and none of the evidence can be found then Tom faces the chair.A very interesting concept still needs a good delivery to make for a good film. This not only had a good idea but it was also a fair point to be made about the death penalty. The film moves along with a good build up for the whole first half. However once Tom finds himself in real trouble then the film strangely doesn't manage to deliver as much tension as it really should have done. Conversely the film becomes more of a melodrama for a while and it loses a lot of momentum. There are some nice touches at the end but they can't completely make up for the weaknesses in the middle section.It is quite atmospheric but not to the point that I had hoped but Lang does a good job on direction. The cast are OK. Andrews has long been one of my favourite actors from the period and he gives a solid if unspectacular show here. Fontaine is weaker and doesn't quite convince as well as Andrews but is fine. Blackmer is pretty enjoyable as Austin Spencer and Ed Binns is a familiar face as Lt. Kennedy.It doesn't quite work as you'd hope as the tension drops off at the exactly the moment that it needs to step up a notch. It is worth watching but it is not one of Lang's better films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good drama wrapped in a B production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Beyond a Reasonable Doubt" is a curious film - it has the look and feel of a B movie and two stars who had seen better days - Dana Andrews and Joan Fontaine - yet it's a good script directed by Fritz Lang. A novelist (Andrews) and his future father-in-law, a newspaper magnet (Sidney Blackmer) work together to prove that the death penalty isn't justified by framing Andrews for a recent murder.I thought the story excellent with some exciting twists, though the whole movie has an underplayed (not to mention inexpensive) feeling to it. Fontaine seemed a little old for her role. However, she does a good job as a sophisticate, and Andrews is good as well. Barbara Nichols does a fine job in a typical supporting role for her.Lang returned to Germany after this film, his last in America. It's an effective plot but one wishes the man who made Metropolis and so many other fine films was given more of a budget for his swansong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprising Twist in a Great Film-Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The owner of an important newspaper Austin Spencer (Sidney Blackmer) opposes to the capital punishment and particularly to the prosecutor Roy Thompson (Philip Bourneuf), who has just succeeded in a trial based on circumstantial evidences. When a dancer is strangled and the police have no suspect, Austin convinces his future son-in-law, the prominent writer Tom Garrett (Dana Andrews), to plant circumstantial evidences to self-incriminate, while he would hold pictures, receipts and other evidences of his innocence until the very last moment. Later Austin would begin a campaign in his newspaper disclosing the possibility of sending an innocent to the electric chair. They decide to hide the truth from Austin's daughter Susan (Joan Fontaine) since she could not support the situation under stress. When the jury withdraws from the court in the end of the trial to give the sentence, Austin takes the evidences that prove the innocence of Tom from his safe, but has a car accident and dies. Tom is sentenced to death penalty and tries to convince Susan of his innocence as his last hope."Beyond a Reasonable Doubt" is a great film-noir with a surprising twist in the very end. The plot seems to be naive ? who would accept to be accused of murder just to prove a point against the death penalty? ? but after the very last twist, the concept changes from naive to Machiavellian. I have glanced unfair reviews in IMDb that I do not agree, since I liked this movie a lot. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Suplício de uma Alma" ("Torment of a Soul")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cold and remarkable (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When we think of the great Hollywood films, we probably think of sensuality, the way they manipulate our emotions through suspense, fear, laughter, sensation, melodrama. BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT might seem to be the antithesis of this kind of film - its cold, formal, mathematical, forbidding distance. It is as brutally insensitive to audience weaknesses as Tom Garrett is to his fiancee - like Lang, he creates a plot to prove something; his lack of humanity, though, counteracts the supposed humanitarianism of his cause, even before we discover his real motives.DOUBT is a cruel movie, which makes its 'implausibility' and 'unrealism' (sic?) part of its theme. Most Hollywood films offer us a hero, no matter how flawed, with whom an audience can identify, with whom they can experience the ups and downs, joys and pains, dangers and relief; he will generally have some redeeming feature, eg Norman Bates' gentleness, Roger Thornhill's charm. Lang refuses us such luxury. Tom is a deeply unpleasant man from the start. There are two realms in the film, that of life, a passive realm, of women, who depend on the time and money of men, who must prostitute themselves for status (both Susan and the strippers); this is a sensual world of the body. Then there is the male realm, icy, intellectual, where plans are hatched, where gods tamper with life and law, use them as playthings, ideas. Tom's dilemma is that he belongs to both. Initially, we are led to suspect that Tom's decision to experiment is a chance to slum, to visit the seedy dives prohibited by his airless upper-middle-class milieu before his marriage, an example of double standards in a male-dominated society.But even at an early stage, the ease with which he assumes his role, his familiarity with the environment, the codes, the language, make one suspicious. So then we query Austin's interest, his chilling suggestion to use a man as a guinea-pig to test the unfairness of capital punishment. He is the classic liberal in the abstract, the sort of man who would justify the gulags as necessary for the greater good. When Tom fobs Susan off with an affirmation of physical desire, we notice Austin's strange look, and wonder if he is trying to set Tom up, wary of his social ambitions or sexual predatoriness (where is Mrs. Spencer)?Tom is a classic noir (and even Victorian) split personality. He navigates two environments, two histories, two (even three) women. Either way, he has committed two crimes, either killing the girl, or planting evidence, obstructing the course of justice. This is a bleak Hollywood instance of the 'hero' being punished, killed, revealed not to be a hero. So who is? Hardly Susan, a mere nuisance in the men's big schemes - her taking over power, by running the paper, and trying to inject emotion into the chilly plot by sentimental appeal dries up like a tear in the desert. Her ex-lover, the dull, dutiful policeman, is in the ironic position of trying to save a murderer from death row, so the latter can marry the woman he loves (the sordid sexual engine of this plot motor is unmistakable and unpleasant).DOUBT has been praised for its geometric austerity, its theorem-like drive. Every shot is dominated by lines, rectangles, and especially triangles, from the sets and camera movements to the placing of characters. But what does the theorem demonstrate? The easy manipulation of American justice (Tom is only foiled by a stupid slip)? The inability of anything, law, art etc. to explain the randomness of life? In its extreme formalism, its spare mise-en-scene, its profusion of screens in different scenes (eg the restaurant and the courtroom) makes the film feel Oriental, and, like AI NO CORRIDA, there is an analysis of surveillance in the public sphere, from the cameras recoding the trial to the DA's trampling the spirit of the law for political gain. There are two extraordinary sequences in this chilling film - the opening execution, a mixture of funeral march and dream; and the pan in the jail over the prisoners that must have been in Godard's head when he made WEEK END.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was on TV not too long ago, and I loved it. I was watching because of the cast, Dana Andrews and Joan Fontaine are reason enough to watch it, but I was very pleasantly surprised. I knew that there was going to be some sort of twist ending, so I was expecting the unexpected - and I was still surprised! Good performances from the entire cast, a job very well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT is Lang's best US film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes, in the world of 1940s-1950s film noir, we are given a film so transparently impossible and contrived that we can see ourselves giving up on watching it half way through. But is extremely rare that we are faced with a film where the very response the viewer is having holds the key to the success, rather than the failure, of the film.Such is the case with BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT, which has - to its credit - been completely misunderstood by many. When we reach the film's conclusion, we realize that even the title of the film itself is a joke, perhaps the ultimate prank on the viewer. Yet to offer analysis of the film would be to destroy its main and most sinister motive; you can't "explain away" the glaring plot holes and contrivances without revealing the twist the film takes in its climax, and to do would rob the viewer of a genuine experience. So... I won't.Suffice it to say, BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT is far more than it seems and is nothing without the sum of its parts, in total. Lang tackles the story of a person who creates a fictitious role for himself in order to, essentially, pull a fast one on the legal profession for personal gain (or, as it appears on the surface, someone else's). In the world of film noir, of course, we know that such a character won't get away with it, but when Lang depicts the tragedy the viewer knows will come, he majestically turns the entire premise on its head. As a result, it's a cold slap in the face - a devastating critique of the complicity of the audience in following along, hungrily, with such contrivances in cinema.Every part of the film fits perfectly by not fitting at all. Even the visual style of the film is a cold, rarely pleasing one, almost daring you to suspend your disbelief just a little bit longer without even granting the pleasure of emotionally charged close-ups at key moments. The editing is brutal and jarring, cutting away practically mid-sentence and moving to a similar conversation elsewhere.As a swan song to his Hollywood career, BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT does to the audience what Billy Wilder does to the industry in SUNSET BLVD. - biting the hand that feeds. The result is a total masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too low-key to thrill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's twenty years as a Hollywood refugee, which had started so spiritedly with "Fury", gradually wound down to the grey, listless offering that is "Beyond a Reasonable Doubt". True, Lang's first and last titles have family resemblances. "Fury" concerns a man who may or may not have committed a capital crime but who deserves due process rather than lynching; "Doubt" is about a guy who frames himself to prove that the irrevocable sentence of capital punishment, legal or not, is never justifiable if the law is fallible.But whereas the argument of "Fury" was driven full steam ahead by a master of montage ("Metropolis") and suspenseful pacing ("M"), "Doubt" consists largely of two- or three-shots of men in suits with "display kerchiefs", arguing in paneled offices with unraised voices. The story has its due ration of twists as Dana Andrews's writer is persuaded by his prospective father-in-law, a crusading press magnate, to set himself up as a burlesque dancer's killer; the two of them will keep records of the plot that are sure to exonerate Andrews before he faces the chair. (Wouldn't he get a stiff sentence for wasting the cops' time, though?) But the focus shifts awkwardly from Andrews to his girl and lawyer as it unwinds, and the scenario is oddly bare of dramatic crises. For example, the press boss's death occurs off screen and his exoneration is brought in by his lawyer, not tracked down by his daughter, Andrews's fiancée. Only a few backstage scenes with the dancing girls, all peroxide and nasal cynicism, enliven proceedings. Andrews had begun to freeze into the stone faced stolidity which hampered his later career, while 39 year old Fontaine (the classic aging actress's age) is matronly in costume, maquillage and demeanor: encased in stately prissiness like other English ladies of Hollywood such as Garson and Kerr.Apart from Fontaine the production looks as well as feels impoverished, aesthetically like Ida Lupino's and Collier Young's problem pics but without their punch. The final twist is not signaled strongly enough to give smarter audience members a decent chance of foreseeing it. At one ludicrous moment, the publisher suggests his guests catch up on the day's highlights in Andrews's murder trial: he turns on a TV which immediately and obligingly recounts them, like George Burns's magic set on "The Burns and Allen Show". Incidentally, was covering trials and commenting on them normal for American television c. 1955?"Beyond a Reasonable Doubt" was a swansong not only for Lang but for RKO. It had abandoned production three years earlier after being wrecked by Howard Hughes, had sold its studio to Desi and Lucy and was now reduced to releasing outside product: in this instance from one Bert Friedlob. It really was time for Herr Lang to catch the plane back to de-Nazified Germany.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too strained and imperfect for even Lang, Fontaine, and Andrews? Yes, sadly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (1956)An early wide screen black and white drama that marks the end of Fritz Lang's American career and also shows the winding down of two great stars, Joan Fontaine and Dana Andrews. The film is no send off, exactly, but it is slightly tired, as if the formula of movie-making needs a twist and it isn't here.That's not the point, of course. This is now the mid-fifties, crisis time for Hollywood, and with widescreen (and widescreen color) movies making a final jab at the rise of television. The plot is sensational, and not too far from what an extended early television drama might try, with mostly interior shooting and a staged (sometimes stagey) presentation. In all it's not Lang's best, and he was a master at both noir/expressionist drama and at getting to the human dilemma of fate and murder. Andrews and Fontaine are not a bad pair?both are matched in calm and sophistication, and beauty, even, though Fontaine seems like an accessory until the very end. Andrews rules the plot, which makes him out to be a writer desperate for a new story. So desperate he's going to pretend to commit a murder just to test the justice system.It's all so outrageous you want to believe it, though your mind says it just wouldn't happen. It's too convenient, and one man's suggestion from the newspaper turns out to be the other man's reality. Enough said!Oddly enough, this is an RKO distribution even after the studio's demise (I don't know the reasons there) but it might point to a less than perfect crew. Certainly the cinematographer, which Lang relied on greatly in earlier films, is no one with credentials. Likewise the editing and writing are fairly routine, even lackluster. And so if a movie that depends on some psychological intensity is really a bit of a grunt effort, whatever the star power involved, it's a bit doomed. So watch this if you are curious about any of the parts. I'm a fan of all three of the principles here, and so had to watch it. But I didn't walk away impressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Arranged Jackpot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his last film in the USA before returning to Germany where he had left to escape the Nazis in the Thirties, Fritz Lang takes up the case of capital punishment and its application, especially when the case is a circumstantial one. Unlike the remake of Beyond A Reasonable Doubt with Jesse Metcalfe as the reporter and Michael Douglas as a corrupt District Attorney, both Sidney Blackmer as a newspaper publisher and Sheppard Strudwick as the politically ambitious DA hold each other in respect. Blackmer is not happy with Strudwick running up a string of murder convictions as a platform to be governor.He and prospective son-in-law Dana Andrews agree to frame Andrews with a string of manufactured evidence all carefully documented with photographs to have the police arrest him for murder of a burlesque queen that the police are stumped about. It certainly works all right, but as the case is coming to verdict, Blackmer is killed in an automobile accident and the evidence burn with him. Andrews is left in quite the jackpot.How it all works out is for you to see. Andrews is not abandoned by fiancé Joan Fontaine who is Blackmer's daughter. She does what she can and toward the end of the film her performance dominates.Fritz Lang certainly builds the tension worthy of Alfred Hitchcock himself. One scene did have me baffled. After the police have gotten those arranged clues, Andrews makes some moves on burlesque dancer Barbara Nichols who resists his advances. I could not quite believe that one at all.This original version is a notch or two above the Metcalfe/Douglas remake. Though it got an interesting alternative remake, this is still the one to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent modernist noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's last film in America saw him reunited with some of the people with whom he had made WHILE THE CITY SLEEPS, and while the budget is still clearly poverty row, once again he comes up with a terrific commentary on the ills at the heart of fifties America. This time, it's the death penalty that forms the centrepiece of the film - or it seems to be, since that's the plot motor. But look closer, and you'll find it's actually about two of Lang's most familiar subjects: guilt and hypocrisy. Almost everyone in the film lives a double life, most obviously Dana Andrews' writer, but even Joan Fontaine's deeply frustrated spinster, who really can't wait to marry Andrews, and whose horror, when she discovers his double life is palpable. Lang floats above his subject matter elegantly, occasionally dipping his toe into the sleaze (a wonderful scene towards the end with a Miami strip-joint owner), getting terrific performances and indicting an entire society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Beyong A Reasonable Doubt" is an offbeat thriller with a fascinating plot about two men who devise a dangerous scheme to expose the flawed nature of the legal system, the uncertain value of circumstantial evidence and the inherent dangers of using the death penalty as a form of punishment for certain crimes. The clever set-up for the story, a number of entertaining plot twists and a good deal of suspense make the whole film compelling to watch and compensate greatly for some of its shortcomings which appear to be attributable mainly to its low budget.Newspaper publisher Austin Spencer (Sidney Blackmer) is an opponent of capital punishment who's become concerned about the conduct of his local D.A. Roy Thompson (Philip Bourneuf) who regularly uses circumstantial evidence to secure convictions for crimes which are punishable by the death penalty. Austin's concerns relate to the unreliable nature of the evidence, the risk of an innocent man being executed and the belief that the D.A. is more concerned with gaining publicity to advance his political career than he is about ensuring that the justice system operates fairly.Austin explains his concerns to Tom Garrett (Dana Andrews) a novelist who used to work for him as a reporter and suggests a plan that could lead to an innocent man being sentenced to death for a crime he didn't commit. If the plan could be carried out successfully and the man's innocence could subsequently be proved, the use of capital punishment could be effectively discredited.Tom, who's engaged to be married to Austin's daughter Susan (Joan Fontaine), agrees to be framed for the murder of a nightclub dancer and as he plants various items of phony evidence, Austin takes photographs which could later be used to prove that Tom's not the murderer. The plan seems to work well and Tom is eventually arrested and tried before the jury withdraw to consider their verdict. At this point, as planned, Austin gathers together the various documents and photographs that will prove Tom's innocence but before he's able to present them to the appropriate officials he's killed in a car crash and all the material that he's carrying which is pertinent to the case is burned in the wreckage. This leaves Tom in an incredibly tight spot and the developments that follow are genuinely surprising.It's deeply ironic that the two men whose scheme is intended to highlight the unfairness and deficiencies of the justice system actually have no concerns about misleading the police by planting false evidence, wasting their time in processing the case or impeding them in their pursuit of the real culprit. Furthermore, both men have no scruples about their plans to exploit the scheme for their own profit as it will provide good material for Austin's newspapers and Tom's next book."Beyond A Reasonable Doubt" is a real no-frills production with some acting performances which are rather perfunctory in nature. The main strengths of this movie however, are its lively pace, its wonderfully bizarre plot and the unexpected twists which make it so intriguing and enjoyable to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting film about the death penalty that makes you think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this film because while it dealt with a tough subject (the morality of the death penalty--particularly in cases where there is circumstantial evidence), it was not preachy and didn't have any obvious answers. I could easily see this movie as being enjoyable to those opposed to the death penalty or those who want to see its widespread use--the film presents so many arguments for both opinions as well as those in the middle. It's actually pretty rare to see a film accomplish so much.Dana Andrews plays a writer who is dating Joan Fontaine. Her father is an editor of a newspaper who is anti-capital punishment and he convinces Andrews to 'set himself up' for murder using only circumstantial evidence. This is to prove that an innocent man could easily be convicted on such evidence and this would supposedly make for an excellent book. So, once an unsolved murder occurred, they step-by-step created evidence that pointed in Andrews' direction but was not damning in and of itself--taking photos that proved the whole thing was orchestrated. One of several holes in the story is that if this REALLY was done, the legal system would not be very forgiving of a man who cost the state a fortune in legal expenses--all for a book! The plan seems to be working out just fine,...that is until the editor is killed in a car crash and the evidence exonerating Andrews is destroyed in the resulting fire!! Now Andrews is about to be convicted and there's no one who can prove it's all a set-up! I liked how towards the end the story took many unexpected turns and was a real thinking-person's film. Unfortunately, the ending is both very interesting but a bit hard to believe. I suggest you just watch it and try not to think about this weak ending too much, as the rest of the film is pretty dandy and engaging. Dana Andrews and director Fritz Lang, as usual, did a fine job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One-off storyline deserves to be seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT isn't a bad slice of 1950s crime and indeed it has one of those one-off story lines (like DOA) which is thoroughly intriguing. The film involves a crusading journalist, staunchly fighting against the death sentence, who decides to implicate himself in a murder case in a bid to expose flaws in the justice system. Inevitably it all goes wrong, with horrendous consequences for himself and his loved ones.The film is directed by Fritz Lang and is his last American movie, and you can sense his heart wasn't really in the material. The ending in particular feels tacked on and unbelievable. As a whole the film lacks the sense of mystery and atmosphere of the likes of WHILE THE CITY SLEEPS and SCARLET STREET, but that's not to say it's bad; it just could have been even better.None of these things change the fact that the plot's a good 'un, even if there's one twist too many along the way. Dana Andrews makes for a solid and dependable leading man as always, and it's nice to see Joan Fontaine playing his love interest, even if she has little to do. Lang directs the various shock and drama scenes effectively and the courtroom spectacle is where this film comes to life, but something I can't quite put my finger on is lacking so I was left slightly disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasonable noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm always pleased to catch a Fritz Lang thriller on the TV schedules and was surprised to learn from IMDb that this was in fact his last Hollywood feature. To be honest, it doesn't really compare to his best work, being quite plot-heavy and not perhaps offering him much inspiration for his customary flourishes. That said it does start very sombrely with a near-silent depiction of an electric-chair execution, before the main, convoluted plot-line kicks in with a too blatant anti-capital punishment message. There's little else for the old maestro to do but try to follow the ins and outs of the story, which is too unbelievable and predicated on coincidence to really convince with even the twist at the end just too far-fetched and under-powered to finish the film on any kind of high, plus the complete absence throughout of any other suspect makes the final denouement obvious in the extreme. It is possible to detect Lang pushing the boundaries a little a la Preminger with occasionally risqué dialogue and Dana Andrews interaction with the strippers but "Anatomy Of A Murder" this isn't. The acting is solid enough with Dana Andrews and Joan Fontaine only occasionally looking befuddled by the over-intricacies of the narrative but in the end this isn't one of the great director's finest hours and not a film he'll be best remembered for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Working the system</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Opening with a death-row electrocution and ending at the moment in which a man is presumably sentenced to the same fate, Reasonable Doubt is defined by its audacious, sensationalistic arrangement of events. The story's anti-capital punishment premise?a struggling writer frames himself for murder to prove the fallibility of the death penalty?obviously lends itself to pulpy embellishment, but the film's most spectacular feat is its jaw-dropping last-reel twist, which puts its own purported moral stance through the ringer by positing emotion as the true determiner of principles. Lang baldly manipulates the audience with this reversal, but his purpose, deeper than momentary awe, is to illustrate the eternal conflict in society between humankind's self-preserving unpredictability and its own noble, if constantly undermined, search for unified moral judgments. What ultimately transcends the stodginess of the theoretical conversations between the main players and their necessarily shallow characterizations (the film hinges on befuddlement for a reason) is Lang's empathy for a condemned man, a sensibility fully embodied in two shots: a close-up on a revoked certificate of pardon and the reverse shot of its regarder as he sadly considers freedom for the last time. In retrospect, the story's outcome is established in one of its very first shots, as the guilty party looks unblinkingly upon an execution while the other spectators turn away in disgust. Lang's thesis is easily described after all: the only man who can emotionlessly observe the practice of capital punishment is himself a murderer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Lang's final movie in America.He was to make another two-part movie in Germany but the latter can easily be dismissed compare to'beyond a reasonable doubt".Prologue:an execution scene,filmed with an absolute intelligence :instead of focusing on the condemned person,the camera searches those who watch a human being die:priest,wardens,executioner,journalists and among them the hero (Dana Andrews).The black and white cinematography is austere,unspectacular,and it will remains so during the whole projection. The hero's soon-to-be father-in-law,who attended the execution too, wants to demonstrate the absurdity of death penalty.He asks Andrews to play the wrong man,guilty of murder;he would bring the proofs or evidences of his innocence just before his execution.To reveal more would make me a spoiler.Suffice to say the suspense is constant,the plot unlikely (Hitchcock's screenplays were too) but fascinating.In France,this movie is praised by the unanimous critics as a peak of the film noir.Give it a chance,it deserves it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Convuleted, Confusing Courtroom Contrivance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PERHAPS SOMEONE HAD the idea of replicating Director Fritz Lang's success at both the critical level as well at the box office with the Spencer Tracy starring vehicle, FURY (MGM, 1936). Although the story lines aren't quite on the same level, they do feature a great deal of court room drama and all of the elements of the detective story; as well as definite influences from Noir Films.WHAT WE, THE members of the viewing audience are asked to do is bear witness to some highly methodical sorts of criminalized re-enactment of a murder. The police procedural aspect of the story and the e-x-t-e-n-d-e-d contrivances that are presented serve to grind the action to such a halt that seemingly goes on forever.IN TRYING TO be a little too smart and "cute" with the viewer, the script does some fancy twists, double twists and even a triple or two. When the final reality is revealed, we find ourselves saying, "But of course" rather than "Yeowww!! That's it!" THE CAST ASSEMBLED is better than average with some fine support given from the character players such as: Sidney Blackmer, Barbara Nichols, Arthur Franz, William Boyett and Dan Seymour. They did manage to get us pulling for them to somehow make this a better and more enjoyable film.OF THE PRINCIPAL players, Dana Andrews and Joan Fontaine are cast in the leads. While their efforts are commendable, they have been showcased to better advantage. Miss Fontaine in particular seems to be quite underused.AS AN ENTERTAINMENT, this is alright for an otherwise quiet day. You should see it once, just to say you did it. You'll be glad you did!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What wonderful plot twists here in this film where a writer is convinced by the newspaper owner to have information planted on him so that he may be arrested in a murder, only for the owner to die in a car crash and the defendant have to go it alone in proving his innocence.This all comes about due to the editor's fierce opposition to the death penalty. The irony of irony is that it spark's our guy into quite a bit of action. Dana Andrews is the writer who joins in the plot concocted by Sidney Blackmer. Joan Fontaine, Andrews's fiancé and daughter of Blackmer, doesn't know what to believe at first until she comes around, only to have to reverse herself at film's end.Barbara Nichols really steals the show here in the scenes she is in. With that craggy, annoying, irritating, sarcastic voice, she is the perfect foil for the intentions of Andrews and Blackmer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this tale of a writer, Dana Andrews, who arranges an indictment of "circumstantial evidence" by picking an unimportant murder case out of the newspaper and, with the aid of the newspaper's editor, plants clues that point to him as the murderer. The editor, however, is busily taking photos with a "self-developing camera" of Andrews cheerfully planting the fake evidence.But -- the best laid plans. Andrews is convicted of the murder, but the editor dies in a car accident and burns up, along with all the evidence of fakery. That leaves Andrews pacing nervously back and forth on Death Row facing two eggs of hydrogen cyanide.His girl friend, Joan Fontaine, does everything she can to help him. When he explains the scheme, she enlists the aid of a detective Arthur Franz, to find any exculpatory evidence. Everyone is nervous.I can't say it's Fritz Lang's best American movie. I saw it in the El Camino Theater in San Bruno, California, and enjoyed it. It's still enjoyable but for a more experience and critical viewer, certain holes in the plot may be apparent.Also, Joan Fontaine, enchanting in her youth, here seems stiff and perfunctory, and wrapped up in the ugliest women's clothes imaginable. My God, the styles were terrible. And make up didn't help. They've tied her blond hair back into a severe bun or whatever it's called.Dana Andrews is his grim and solemn self, but he's older too, and he was in the grip of alcohol and looks puffy.For whatever its weaknesses may be, it's worth catching. It would have made a perfect episode on Alfred Hitchcock Presents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather flat end to a solid period of film noir for Fritz Lang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's last American film before he returned to Germany, Beyond a Reasonable Doubt suffers from the director's clear lack of interest. Lang was reportedly dismayed by the lack of visual creativity allowed by American producers (which was also clear in his penultimate American noir, While the City Sleeps (1956)), and so shortly after returned to his homeland to make the visually lavish double-bill Tiger of Bengal and The Indian Tomb (1959), dubbed the 'Indian Epic'. Beyond a Reasonable Doubt, an intriguing little noir starring Dana Andrews, is by no means a bad film, but is clearly the work of a man handicapped by the system and a film that is pessimistic in its execution.Tom (Andrews), a novelist in search of inspiration for his second book, is approached by his newspaper publisher father-in-law Austin Spencer (Sidney Blackmer) to help aide his opposition of state capital punishment. The plan is to plant circumstantial evidence of Tom's fake involvement in the recent unsolved murder of nightclub stripper Patty Gray. Naturally, during the trial, an incident prevents Austin from delivering the evidence and testimony that will prove Tom's innocence, so Tom's disgruntled fiancée Susan (Joan Fontaine) races against time to prevent Tom getting executed on Death Row.Lang had already exposed the fragility of the justice system in his German masterpiece M (1931), and Beyond a Reasonable Doubt begins in suitably grim fashion with the silent execution of an inmate. The plot is a great idea (to think what Hitchcock would have made of it) but the execution is plain and predictable. Although Andrews' performance is solid and the movie sometimes threatens to push the boundaries set by the censors at the time, it simply goes through the motions until a twist reveal in the last 15 minutes livens things up a bit. You most likely won't see it coming, but it ends the film with plenty of plot- holes to pick at and left me scratching my head at exactly what point the movie was trying to make. A rather flat end to a solid period of film noir for the German master.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hero gets a lot more than he bargained for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we're presented with a contrived premise of daring proportions that in the hands of director Fritz Lang is compelling and entertaining movie fare. It's a psychological thriller with plot momentum and a twist ending that resolves all that came before? with a real payoff for the viewer. Dana Andrews, playing Tom Garrett, an investigative reporter, takes on a crusade casting himself as lead crusader. His plan is to expose the over-zealous district attorney Thompson, an unethical man always working towards one more criminal conviction and one more execution, and he doesn't care how he gets the result. Garrett's intent therefore is twofold, to expose judicial malfeasance and thereby present a dramatic case against capital punishment. Garrett puts into action a plan with an intricate train of events and trail of incriminating evidence framing himself for a crime he did not commit. The murder victim is an unsympathetic nightclub chorus floozy with a reputation for showing any man everything she's got if there's money in it for her. Garrett's co-conspirator and dedicated support in this ruse is influential newspaper publisher Austin Spencer, the only other person who knows of Garrett's deception. That his playing at murderer may be a dangerous masquerade that will place him in real peril doesn't seem to overly concern Garrett. He has safeguards in place. What can go wrong? Well, just about everything. The ensuing press coverage is sordid and full of sensationalism rising to a fever pitch, which the DA styles as "working up artificial emotions." This newspaper frenzy is not entirely unwelcome PR to the the DA whose professional ambitions thrive on publicity.Joan Fontaine is Garrett's love interest and incidentally, the daughter of the newspaper publisher. Fontaine's character Susan Spencer is a pale personality, a lovely, well-bred society girl who shows distress by pacing up and down and twisting a handkerchief clutched in her hands. Fontaine, always somewhat of a decorous wallflower, does manage to muster some self-assertion in her efforts to save her love when his situation as murder suspect number one turns bleak and dire. Dana Andrews puts out his usual journeyman's effort; he's a solid actor who always seems to be working hard at his craft. This is a neat little movie. "Movie time" well spent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had forgotten that I had previously seen this film. The overall concept seemed vaguely familiar, but I had forgotten enough of the details that I thought it must be similar to some other film I had seen.I always liked Dana Andrews, and do in this film, too, although this is hardly one his best remembered films. Andrews here is as good as ever, but there are places the film itself lets him down.It must have been a letdown for Joan Fontaine. Just a decade earlier she was making big budget films with the likes of Cary Grant. This is no A picture, although I would call it a very good B picture.One of my favorite character actors is here -- Sidney Blackmer. Excellent for his part.Philip Bourneuf plays the district attorney. He looks the part -- at least as it might have been thought of back in 1956, but he isn't very impressive with his acting here. There are a number of other character actors here that you will be more familiar with. In terms of the cast, overall this film is relatively impressive.This film is sneaky. You think you have it all figured out about 15 or 20 minutes into it. But, you will be surprised.Dana Andrews, a writer, agrees to take the fall for a murder in order to help his fiancé's father (Sidney Blackmer), a newspaper publisher, make a point against capital punishment. They plot to fake evidence to make it appear he committed the murder.You're only into the film a few minutes before you begin to think that either Blackmer is guilty himself and is trying to frame Andrews, OR Blackmer will die before being able to prove Andrews innocent. Duh! I knew this when I was a kid watching this film on t.v.Secondly, you know Andrews will be convicted and sentenced to the electric chair. Duh...again.The end of this film is filled with twists, some of which are a bit surprising. And the ending is not what you will expect. I think the last 15-20 minutes are clumsily done, but effective. This film is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (1956),' another taut thriller from Fritz Lang, takes an intriguing concept and runs with it. Tom Garrett (Dana Andrews), a writer looking for an idea, and Austin Spencer (Sidney Blackmer), an editorialist against capital punishment, contrive a bizarre scheme to expose the flaws in the American legal system. Garrett agrees to set himself up as the prime suspect in a murder, using only circumstantial evidence. Spencer agrees to withhold the evidence of his innocence until after Garrett is convicted and sentenced to the death penalty. Joan Fontaine plays Susan Spencer, Garret's fiancée, who isn't let in on the ruse. The moment when Austin Spencer is killed in a car accident, leaving our hero seemingly without any hope of reprieve, is still shocking despite its inevitability, leaving a powerful feeling of hopelessness. The film's final twist, however, I did not see coming. Regrettably, 'Beyond a Reasonable Doubt' pulls yet another twist in its final seconds; it would've been better had the film been made a decade later, free from the restraints of the Production Code, which demanded (and received) an ending that "does not lower the moral standards" of audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can you really tell when a man is guilty?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe not quite what it could have been, but recommended. This probably suffers most from what appears to be a low budget--and arguably a dearth of style from director Fritz Lang. But Lang could be quite flamboyant in other films, so perhaps the relatively straightforward style here is meant to suit the movie and its themes. And it's the story and themes that will have you talking afterwards: Though it's vaguely far-fetched and certainly contrived, this is quite the screenplay. I won't say anything other than the following: Dana Andrews plays Tom Garrett, a novelist who's persuaded by his newspaper mogul friend Austin Spencer (Sidney Blackmer) to pose as the suspect in a murder in order to prove the pitfalls of circumstantial evidence and politics in death penalty cases. Andrews eventually gets in over his head, and... well, see for yourself. Mildly underwhelming in route, "Beyond a Reasonable Doubt" nonetheless gathers a pretty good head of steam by its surprising climax. Dana Andrews gives a typically solid performance; if that sounds like slight praise, I don't mean it like that; he's a personal favorite of mine, especially for the work he did in noirs, and he seems today rather sadly under-appreciated, if not largely forgotten. Joan Fontaine is also on hand here as Susan Spencer, Garrett's fiancé and Austin's daughter. Overall, somewhat disappointing on the level of production, but otherwise very much worth a look for classic film fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond circumstantial evidence is possibly folly?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beyond a Reasonable Doubt is directed by Fritz Lang and written by Douglas Morrow. It stars Dana Andrews, Joan Fontaine, Sidney Blackner, Arthur Franz and Philip Bourneuf. Music is by Herschel Burke Gilbert and cinematography by William Snyder. Plot has Andrews as a writer who hatches a plan with his future father-in-law to expose the weakness in using circumstantial evidence to send suspects to the electric chair. The ruse is to plant "evidence" that will incriminate Andrews in a topical murder and see him sentenced to death. Then the two men will reveal their own photographic evidence to prove the folly of law and the death penalty. But it's a dangerous game to play, and fate and hidden secrets may have the ultimate say on the outcome?It was Fritz Lang's last American movie, after wowing cinema fans with such excellent pictures like M, The Big Heat, Scarlet Street and While the City Sleeps, it's safe to say that Beyond A Reasonable Doubt is not the great swansong many had reason to expect. There's nothing particularly impressive about the camera work or photography, while the sets look distinctly under nourished. But veering away from our yearnings for technical smarts, film finds Lang determined to prove a bitter based point whilst enjoying dangling his protagonist above a fascinating pit of ifs and maybes.The fascination comes from the court case that underpins the movie, as we observe the law unfurling its might, privy to the dangerous ruse perpetrated by Andrews' daring Guinea Pig. It feels cold in narrative, and most certainly that is intentional because the last fifteen minutes of film pulls the rug from under everyone and finally reveals its hand. It's then, as the end card appears, that the film comes full circle and delivers on the promise of a game of human chess. Where the winner is not innocence or guilt, but something that drives many a film noir picture, that which concerns the vagaries of fate.The main cast players rightly play it sedately, with Andrews calm and understated, and Fontaine regal like and serene in dialogue delivery. Best turns come from the support slots, with Blackner most interesting as the newspaper publisher-come potential father-in-law-come the man who originated the idea for the "hoax", and Barbara Nichols who charms and entertains as the air head dancer who becomes a critical pawn in this particularly tricksy game of deceit and suspicion. It's never overtly film noir until the last quarter, and really it's a court room/legal drama sprinkled with some less than sparkly dust. Yet in spite of the undeniable contrivances that reside within the plot, this is still prime Lang for the way it observes the law and the human condition that said law brings out of the skin. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This good Lang's film contains murder, noir cinema, drama, thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last American film Lang presented as a twist on the beloved themes of innocence and justice.Under the guise of an argument against the death penalty, this film is a rigorous analysis of the moral standards of American society in which the director had an impact for twenty years.The film contains murder, noir cinema, drama, and thriller. It has the basic equipment of producing "While the City Sleeps" (1956), is Lang's second collaboration with producer Independent Bert E. Friedlob and is one of the latest films from RKO, doomed to bankruptcy, which is acquired (1957) by Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz (Desilu). Studies are sold 10 years later at the Paramount.This film has spiral construction. The constant argument turns bewildered by the coldness of the individual parts that are going to set up a mechanism of irreversible effects. The last lap of the spiral tip makes the film and perhaps the author intended to address unusual and unsettling.With this film Lang closes an important stage of his life. His cold and rigid conception of the film failed to find your best accommodation in the Hollywood industry, but despite the limitations that endured: custom movies, meager budgets, actors taxes, part of FIMS of successful intrusions into their task, etc., succeeded in making great films, many even superior to German films, and also in all the genres that were made in the studies. Unlike other masters, his size, proved to be able to reflect his personality over the external conditions.</fullReview>

The thing that amazes me is that the court system would have allowed a man who manipulated the law to just walk away, even if he were found innocent of the murder. He perpetrated fraud and used the justice system so he could write an expose. This just wouldn't happen. Otherwise it's a little like "The Witness for the Prosecution" where we think we've got it and the rug is pulled out from under us. Dana Andrews emotes and prances about, self righteous to a fault. Of course, with the movie codes of the day, there are issues that need to be addressed, especially at the conclusion. Then there is basic loyalty versus the law. These are all themes.

		<shortDescription>Lang's Last American Film Proves Intriguing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Beyond A Reasonable Doubt" is the last film that "M" director Fritz Lang made in Hollywood, and the theme of this intriguing but far-fetched law and order thriller concerns the morality of capital punishment. Capital punishment, crime, and murder obsessed Lang throughout his lengthy career, and this RKO release provided Lang with another opportunity to deal with an innocent man who through a fluke in the justice system may die for a crime that he didn't commit.Tom Garrett (Dana Andrews of "The Ox-Bow Incident") is a former newspaper journalist turned novelist who agrees to test the strength of the justice system when his former boss, newspaper publisher Austin Spencer (Sidney Blackmer of "Duel in the Sun"), thinks that the local district attorney is too good at his trade. Spencer loathes the idea that an ambitious District Attorney Roy Thompson (Philip Bourneuf of "The Molly Maguires") will exploit his ability to send men to the electric chair as a means to becoming the next governor. When a burlesque queen is murdered, Tom and Austin proceed with their plan to implicate Tom for the homicide.Meanwhile, Austin's daughter Susan (Joan Fontaine of "Suspicion") does not understand this secret scheme that her father and Tom are concocting until she sees a picture of her fiancée in the newspaper with another woman Dolly Moore (Barbara Nichols), who stripped at the same club with the victim. Anyway, Tom buys a grey top-coat which a witness, who could not discern the facial features of the man, said he was wearing. Tom takes a lighter that Susan gave him and throws it in a ravine near where the girl died. Eventually, Thompson takes Tom into custody and charges him with the death of the stripper. The morning of the sentencing, Austin puts all the pictures in an envelop and backs out of his garage. No sooner has he backed out than a truck collides with him, knocks his car over, and a fire erupts. Austin dies in the car and the evidence goes up in smoke. Tom reacts with shock at the death of Austin. He goes into court and explains what happened, but the jury finds him guilty and he is sentenced to die in the electric chair.The two sizzling surprises that cap this nifty 80-minute melodrama will leave you reeling. The chief difference between this version and the new Michael Douglas version is that Lang did not have the elaborate technology the director Peter Hyams takes advantage of in his remake. Furthermore, the protagonists in the Lang version were targeting the death penalty and the ease with which Thompson won convictions on circumstantial evidence. In the Hyams version, the district attorney is crooked from the get-go. Unfortunately, this threadbare, black &amp; white production will strike contemporary attention-deficit audiences that crave explosive action-fests as boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine an innocent man convicted for a crime he did not commit, being tried and found guilty. The laws of that particular state demand a sentence of death on the electric chair. After meeting the fate ordered by the verdict, the man goes to his death and when all is done, new evidence shows someone else was the real culprit. Is that justice?That is the point of Austin Spencer, a newspaper publisher, completely opposed to the death penalty. His own future son-in-law, Tom Garrett, a novelist, could not agree with him much more. Spencer wants to build a fake case with the help of Tom, in which a horrible crime in the news is brought to the attention of the police and the District Attorney. For that, Tom Garrett chooses the case of a burlesque dancer that was found dead and the case proves to be a mystery for the law enforcement people. Tom will act the part of the elusive man sought by the police as the killer.Austin and Tom fabricate a story that follows closely the real murder. Austin wants to document the way they prepared the fake case. Tom, reluctantly agrees to go along and pose as the assassin. His own wedding to Austin's daughter, the lovely Susan Spencer, might be in jeopardy. If Tom is condemned to die on the electric chair, Austin will have all the evidence to render the case for capital punishment for Tom a mockery of the system.Fritz Lang directed this RKO 1956 film. The director had a vivid imagination; evidently he was intrigued by the application of justice in his adoptive country, as shown in the magnificent "Fury" of his early Hollywood career. The screenplay by Douglas Morrow offers a satisfying courtroom drama with an ironic twist most viewers do not expect.Dana Andrews is at the center of the picture as Tom Garrett, a successful novelist in his own right, much in love with Susan Spencer. Mr. Andrews was an actor that delivered, as is the case here, although his style was a terse approach to his characters. Sidney Blackmer, a veteran actor himself, is also at his best with his take of the publisher with a conscience that wants to see the death penalty abolished in his lifetime. Joan Fontaine appears as Susan Spencer. Her role could be seen as supporting, because she is relegated to just adorn the film with only a few important scenes to her credit.The supporting roles are more interesting in the film. Barbara Nichols is perfect as the burlesque girl at the center of Austin Spencer's plans. Bob Hale, Shepperd Strudwick, Phillip Bourneuf, Ed Binns, and Joyce Taylor, among the large cast do a wonderful job in the film.Highly recommended for all Fritz Lang's fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ingenious but Mechanical Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Beyond a Reasonable Doubt" was the last Hollywood film of German-born director Fritz Lang. It is a crime drama with a strange premise- a man plants evidence to incriminate himself in a crime. The man in question is Tom Garrett, a successful novelist who is engaged to Susan, the daughter of a newspaper proprietor named Austin Spencer. Spencer is leading a crusade against capital punishment, and discusses with his prospective son-in-law a scheme he has concocted to discredit the death penalty. He will wait until a murder is committed for which the police have no obvious suspects. He and an accomplice will then plant evidence at the scene of the crime implicating the accomplice in the murder. The accomplice will be arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced to death. At this point Spencer will come forward with the evidence which will prove the man's innocence, leading to his release and (or so Spencer hopes) to the abolition of capital punishment in the State.Shortly afterwards a stripper named Patti Gray is found strangled, and Garrett volunteers to act as guinea-pig in Spencer's scheme. He and Spencer plant evidence suggesting Garrett's guilt, and he is duly arrested and placed on trial for Patti's murder. A series of plot twists then follow. Spencer, the one man who can prove Garrett's innocence, is killed in a car crash, and the documentary evidence of Garrett's innocence is presumed to have been destroyed along with his car. Garrett attempts to tell the court about his part in Spencer's scheme, but he is not believed and is convicted. At the last minute the vital documents are discovered in Spencer's safe, and when they are proved to be genuine the prosecution recommend to the State Governor that Garrett be pardoned.There is, however, one final twist to follow. In a conversation with Susan, Garrett inadvertently reveals that he has been guilty all along; Patti, whose real name was Emma Blucher, was Garrett's former wife and had been pursuing him for money ever since he achieved success as a novelist. He went along with Spencer's scheme because he saw it as a chance to kill her and then be formally proclaimed innocent of her death.As a thriller, the film has its points of interest, but it fails as a human drama because all the characters are either unsympathetic or uninteresting. Even before the truth about Garrett is revealed, he seems too keen to go along with Spencer's hare-brained scheme, which must make us wonder what his true motives are, and his behaviour involves a good deal of emotional cruelty to Susan, the woman he supposedly loves. Spencer, as another reviewer has pointed out, is the sort of left-liberal ideologue who sees everything in abstract terms without weighing the human cost of his ideas. Roy Thompson, the crusading District Attorney who prosecutes Garrett, is the sort of right-wing ideologue who is motivated less by a genuine concern for law and order than by political ambition. Susan is bland and colourless. Garrett's defence lawyer Jonathan Wilson is a minor figure. The police are hopelessly incompetent, failing to uncover the most elementary facts about the murder victim, including her marriage to Garrett and her true name. The only character who has any spark about her is Dolly, the brassy peroxide-blonde showgirl whom Garrett briefly befriends as part of his scheme.Despite its theme, the film does not make any serious contribution to the debate on capital punishment. As Spencer points out, fictional stories are of little use in this debate, which is why makers of films attacking the death penalty ("I Want to Live", "10 Rillington Place", "Let Him Have It") have tended to concentrate on real-life miscarriages of justice rather than invented ones. The film glosses over the drawbacks in Spencer's scheme. Apart from the obvious danger of an man being put to death for a crime he did not commit should the scheme go wrong, these drawbacks are legal, moral and practical. What Spencer and Garrett are doing is illegal and they could be prosecuted for wasting police time or conspiring to pervert the course of justice. Morally, Spencer's idea of securing the conviction of an innocent man means that the real murderer will go undetected and free to kill again. Practically, even if Spencer's idea had succeeded perfectly, its success would not have persuaded many supporters of capital punishment to change their minds. It is hard to regard a case in which the defendant engineers his own conviction as a genuine miscarriage of justice."Halliwell's Film Guide" describes this film as an ingenious but mechanical thriller, and it is hard to dissent from that judgement. The plot is a far-fetched one, but it is competently handled, even if the final twist did seem rather too obvious. It never succeeds, however, on any level other than that of the mechanical thriller; in the last resort it is clever but cold and pretentious. It is not on the same level as Lang's great noir thriller from three years earlier, "The Big Heat". 6/10</fullReview>

Also bad ending. What Susan Spencer heard was "hearsay evidence". They were alone in the room and as long as Garrett maintained he DIDN'T mention the girl's real first name, who would be able to tell who was telling the truth and who wasn't? Sorry, a disappointing movie -especially from a master like Lang whom Hitchcock revered and emulated. Hitch would've done better with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Square, straightforward Fritz Lang (what Hitchcock could've done with this!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Opening with a ridiculously melodramatic prison execution scene, director Fritz Lang sets up this 'hard-bitten' story in the hoariest manner. Plot about former newspaperman-turned-novelist incriminating himself in a murder he didn't commit (to make points on capital punishment AND come up with a bestseller in the bargain!) is just dumbfoundingly basic, a connect-the-dots noir without any of the genre's suspense, passion or intrigue. Hitchcock would have certainly added some subtext; here, Lang is straightforward in all the wrong ways, underlining every human stupidity just to make that maximum impact. It's a message picture wherein the message is buried underneath impossible contrivances. As late-night TV fodder, the film is just passable, but as a Hollywood career-capper for Fritz Lang it's all rather depressing. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Story; Disappointing Results</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (1956) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Frustrating film about a journalist (Dana Andrews) who decides to show that the current court system has a lot of holes in it by framing himself for the murder of a dancer. The plan is to be convicted by a jury and sent to death row where he, along with the help of his girlfriend's father (Sidney Blackmer), will admit that they were just trying to bring down the system. Lang's final American film has a terrific idea but none of it really comes together and when the end credits come up you can't help but be very, very disappointed. All of the elements for a great film are right here but I guess Lang was in a hurry to get back home because his direction is way too laid back and he really never brings any life or energy to the film. The biggest problem is the first hour where the investigation and trial take place because we know what's going to happen and we know to expect a twist in the story. When this twist does happen it comes as no surprise because it's the exact same twist anyone would be expecting to happen. When this twist finally appears it actually kick starts the movie a bit but by this time it's way too late. The final twenty-minutes of the film finally gets some drama going and we get yet another twist that I certainly didn't see coming. Lang appears to have snapped out of his sleep-walking and it's a shame more detail and thought wasn't given to the first portion. The performances are a mixed bag as the usually reliable Andrews pretty much goes through the motions here. Not once did I see any real emotion coming from him as he appears bored and just walking through the bit. Joan Fonataine turns in a fine performance as the girlfriend and Blackmer is good as her father. Philip Bourneuf is also good in the role of the prosecutor. There are many good things in this film but sadly there are some bad ones that keep this movie from being a masterpiece. It's hard to believe that the first part of this movie could be so flat but perhaps the filmmakers should have had the first hour trimmed down to twenty-minutes and then make the final moments stretched out and centered the majority of the movie on them. This is still a noir worth seeing but I really wish I could have called this a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good idea wasted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many years ago I saw this film at the movies, and remembered it as a good thriller but with many shortcomings - and I have just seen it on TCM, and now fully realise what a good idea Fritz Lang had in this story, but the story line did not live up to the idea. When one looks at the actors involved, and considering their prestige at the time of its making, it is obvious that there was some miscasting. For example, Joan Fontaine was not a good choice as the fiancée of the hero played by Dana Andrews - she acted poorly in all her scenes, and somehow this took away from the suspense. Arthur Franz had perhaps one of his better roles in a supporting part, and Sidney Blackmer was very good, but overall this film fell way short of what it should have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fritz Lang on trial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beyond a Reasonable Doubt permits a scathing criticism of acclaimed and highly revered director Fritz Lang's seemingly inert direction of the said film. But give Lang his due he makes the implausible situations within the film's plot make a coherent and intriguing story. Meanwhile, informing on her ex-fiancé's admission to guilt was less to do with Susan's (Joan Fontain) ability to place her ethics above any feelings for Tom (Dana Andrews), if she had any left. It is more about her saving face, and incrimination should the truth eventually come out. Moreover it liberates her to become involved with her former boyfriend,who ironically is the detective handling the case involving Tom. But, the question is, did Susan succumb to the detective's love interest in her as a result of her vulnerable state? Did this push her towards her decision to inform on Tom?Meanwhile Tom's alleged guilt exonerates the jury system who give the verdict which the viewer might well doubt and by default undermine a well established democratic criminal system. Likewise the police's evidence becomes substantiated where the film contrived doubt. As such faith in the police, law and order is restored. By this process, the liberal advocates are put on trial for their soft approach to justice and especially capital punishment. Therefore, capital punishment becomes a justifiable aspect of a civilised, ordered society.In all a film that leaves the viewer with thought if not surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond a Reasonable Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film begins with an interesting premise: A writer and a newspaperman are anti-Capital Punishment. They decide to "frame" the writer (Mr. Andrews) for murder; after he is tried and convicted, they plan to reveal he didn't commit the murder - saving him from the electric chair and showing how easily an innocent man can be killed with circumstantial evidence. "Capital Punishment" (1925) had a similar plot.The movie held my attention, albeit barely. For a movie requiring you to THINK (as in, think about Capital Punishment), you really can't THINK at all. The more I thought, the more I had questions - about the PLOT of this story - like WHAT do these guys think should happen to the "REAL KILLER" of this woman? You really have to turn off you brain to fully enjoy "Beyond a Reasonable Doubt", because it makes no sense if you think it through... I had events pretty much figured out before they happened. I thought too much, I guess. I don't think the film says much about Capital Punishment, but the IDEA is a good one; it has made a better film in different hands. *** Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (9/5/56) Fritz Lang ~ Dana Andrews, Joan Fontaine, Sidney Blackmer, Arthur Franz</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... because someone told me what the twist was before I saw this I guess I was approaching it from the angle 'well, let's see how they got there'. And there was still a bit which made me surprised (no spoilers though). The film twists and turns through moral and amoral viewpoints and is very dark in its whole outlook. I wonder if it looked so contrived on release? I expect not. And I'm not so sure it is. Also good to see Joan Fontaine in a role which required her to be more than docile (Jane Eyre, Suspicion) or bats (The Witches). The only thing which seems rushed about Doubt are the last couple of scenes, everything seems crammed into that last few minutes. Other than that, I liked it very much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Mind blowing movie about the use and misuse of the death penalty thats very much like "The Life of David Gale" released 47 years later. In this case it's story is so contrived and convoluted, compared to the also manipulating David Gale, that you just want to rewind your VCR or DVD player just to see if what you actually saw and heard on the screen the previous 80 or so minutes really happened!A life long opponent to the death penalty newspaper publisher Austin Spencer, Sidney Blackman, comes up with this bright idea of having an innocent man arrested tired and convicted for a murder that he didn't commit. Then just when he's about to be executed pull out a file cabinet full of evidence, that he and the accused man secretly gathered, to show how wrong the death penalty really is. By having a totally innocent man on the brink of being executed by the state.Austin get's writer Tom Garrett, Dana Andrews, who's engaged to his daughter Susan, Joan Fontaine, to go along with his hair-brain scheme as the person who's to be sent to the electric chair until he comes charging, like the US calvary, to the rescue into the D.A's office with a car-load of evidence exonerating the soon to be fried Tom. Looking in the newspapers Austin finds this story about a dancer being found strangled outside he city. With no clues for the police to follow up and together with Tom plans to create and plant evidence that it was Tom who murdered her.Having everything documented to prove Tom's innocence Austin has it all under lock and key in his office until just after Tom, like it was planned from the start, was arrested tried and convicted of the dancers murder and is just about to be executed. Austin taking all the documents and photos out of his office safe and about to drive with them to the D.A's office to prove Tom's innocence is hit by a runaway truck killing himself.Austin death destroys all the evidence that would exonerate Tom and thus keep him from being dispatched from this earthly realm! Talk about Bad Luck!If you think that the film would now concentrate on finding evidence by Austin's daughter,and Tom's fiancé, Susan as well as his lawyer Jonathan Wilson, Sheppard Strudwick, of his innocence, in order to save Tom from the chair, your wrong dead wrong. We go into this totally unexpected scenario where Susan's former boyfriend and now assistant D.A Bob Hale, Arther Franz,tracks down the truth about Tom's alleged murder victim dancer Peggy Gray Peggy in fact turned out to be a young woman named Emma Blucher! I was surprised how naive Hale was in finding out that Emma used a different or professional name when she was an exotic dancer. Like he never came across anything like this in all his years in the D.A's office as well as by just reading the newspapers?The movie, and Tom, go into the final stages in preparations for execution day until it's found that Austin left a hand written statement in a safe-deposit box totally exonerating Tom of any guilt in Emma Bluchers, aka Peggy Gray, murder. And you think that it's, this almost indescribable and mind boggling film, finally over but wait again! There's an even bigger surprise withing for you, and everyone on the screen, just as the movie is about to end which leaves your brain frozen in a total state of suspended animation.It's hard to imagine that a movie like this was ever made with top stars, Dana Andrews Joan Fontaine etc., being in it but in fact it was and the only reason that any studio was willing to go along in bankrolling it. Was it because of it's director the legendary Fritz Lang who also came up with the idea of the movie "Beyond a Reasonable Doubt" in the first place. Fritz outlive his welcome in Hollywood after this, his last American made film, brain-twister was released. Fritz then like a puff of smoke dissipated into nothingness never to be seen or heard or called on, by the Hollywood studios, again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond all reason...a curious misfire...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Fritz Lang in the director's chair, this should have been a much tighter, more suspenseful film than it actually is. Part of the problem is the script--the characters portrayed by Dana Andrews and Joan Fontaine are poorly written. Fontaine, in particular, has little to do with the scheme of things and Andrews is so good at being an anti-hero that he makes the character even more unpleasant than he has to be. Barbara Nichols stands out in a good supporting role as a brassy blonde showgirl and Sidney Blackmer as a man who concocts the scheme that lands Andrews in prison is excellent. And by the way, contrary to what a viewer states here, Donna Reed is nowhere in the supporting cast.Aside from that, the outcome leaves you baffled. It's a surprise, all right, but it all seems to be too patly contrived--a twist upon twist that stretches credibility to the limit. A letdown feeling is the overall result of the deceptive ending.A tight-lipped Dana Andrews and a sophisticated Joan Fontaine (too frosty as his loyal fiancé) have both done better work. Fontaine has one of her weakest roles, but the film's biggest flaw is the way it toys with the viewer's expectations and then fails to deliver that final punch.Definitely one of Fritz Lang's lesser works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only one phone call!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a Fritz Lang fan. This movie is very good but I think it has some plot holes in it that no one other then Lang could get away with. We have this hokey execution scene in the very beginning of the movie and next we see two men talking about the execution. One is a publisher the other Dana Andrews who is going out with the Publishers daughter, Joan Fontaine and is working for him too. The Publisher is telling Andrews his thoughts about Capital Punishment that actually mirror my feelings. The publisher has good relationship with the DA though. But he still feels that Innocent people are sent to Old Sparky. Andrews is not convinced but the next day he agrees to go along with this scheme to set him up for murder he did not commit. All of this circumstantial evidence is planted and the publisher has all of this info so if Andrews in convicted he will come clean and say it was a ruse to prove how simple it is to send a man to Death Row. Well I knew what was going to happen before it happened. BUT I was not prepared for the real surprise. My only complaints is that IMO the DA character gets off lightly. The problem with Capital Punishment is not only the taking of a life but overly ambitious DA's. In todays world no one would ever take this type of chance because DA's rarely even regard new evidence unless they are forced to by judges and that happens rarely. The DA in this movie was more then happy to see the new evidence. SO if this was suppose to be social commentary on Capital Punsihment Fritz Lang dropped the ball about one of its major faults. Overly ambitious DA's who refuse to back down no matter what. The very last scene in the movie with Fontaine and a would be suitor is incredible. All I have to say is that all it takes is one phone call? This is not Fury but even a OK Fritz Lang is better then most movies. And I do think the subject matter is very interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be the worst Lang film ever. No wonder this was his last American film. He must have been kicked out of Hollywood for directing such a cold, uninteresting and absurdly flat film. The writer must have written the script when he was in grade school. The script went something like this: Hey, I was always against capitol punishment, how about you take the rap for this girl's murder? Just to prove that innocent men can be convicted. But don't worry, I will take pic. of you as you fabricate the evidence and just before you are being sent to the electric chair, I will come forward to testify what we have done. Just to prove to the world my point. Well, I don't know. Do they have any leads who the real murderer is? Well, let me call headquarters. No, not any leads. Well then OK I guess I will do it! Now attempting to point all evidence that he was the murder, he plants evidence. Then he has to get one of the dancing girls to take notice of him so he can date her. What to do? I know. I will go to her local hangouts and spill water on her dress. Then try to offer her money to buy a new dress. AND IT WORKED. But the dancing burlesque girl has these funny feelings because he wants to go parking! What a suspicious thing to do! SO I guess I will call the Police! This movie was so contrived. Everything about it was ridiculous and far fetched as to be totally unbelievable from the beginning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On seeing the first few minutes of this film, started off thinking "Oh no, not another load of anti capital punishment rubbish !" but by taking the time to watch and follow the plot, I realize that my initial judgment had been too hasty. In fact the capital punishment element is just a pretext for a very good suspense thriller in the style of Alfred Hitchcock.The first thing to say is that at the end there are a number of surprises which you cannot guess at the outcome, obviously the first viewing then is the most efficient plot-wise, as the surprise element is lost thereafter. However subsequent viewings enable you to analyze the characters better and notice certain details not seen the first time round.The plot is INGENIOUS - no other word for it. I'm not one of the greatest fans of Dana Andrews but he did appear fairly convincing in this film. I won't dwell too much on the plot as this could give the game a way to prospective first-time viewers !n Suffice it to say that it is a wholly recommendable piece of work, with a fair amount of substance and not too much anti-capital punishment preaching !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This has got to be Fritz Lang's worst movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise is good. A writer (Dana Andrews) conspires with a feisty anti-capital punishment newspaper owner (Sidney Blackmer) to frame himself for murder and get the death penalty. Blackmer is to jump out at the last moment to prove Andrews innocent, thus proving that the system doesn't work. Okay, so even the premise is flawed - what are they going to do when charged with a massive charge of interfering with a criminal investigation? - but it could have worked, I think. Unfortunately, the script is simply crappy. I mean, the point of a trial is in the details, and the writer (Douglas Morrow, who should have been punished for incompetence) completely skips over the most obvious points that the lawyers would have mentioned. For example, the defense attourney doesn't even propose that the body makeup found on Andrews' car seat (he put it there to fabricate evidence) still could have come from Dolly Moore, even though she washes herself after work. And, even after that, Morrow forgets a lot of the little details himself. For example, Andrews wipes all the fingerprints from the interior of his car (he wants the prosecuting attourney to bring this up as exceptionally odd), but then he takes Ms. Moore out that very night (and is arrested on the spot, with no time to wipe her fingerprints away). There are a couple of big plot twists. The first is predictable, the second is stupid. Was this movie later remade as The Life of David Gale, because the two plots sound a lot alike? Add to this some truly lazy direction from Lang (it seems like a mediocre TV movie from the time), a wooden performance from Andrews, and a wasted performance from Joan Fontaine, and you have yourself a bad movie.</fullReview>

Strange and far fetched premise makes this one an almost laughable drama, with no credibility or real strenght.
