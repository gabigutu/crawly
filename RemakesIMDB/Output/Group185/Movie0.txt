		<shortDescription>PETER LORRE, VICTOR FRANCEN &amp; J. CARROL NAISH WERE GREAT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very easy to critize the plot or story line of this picture, however, Peter Lorre made this film into an all time great classic along with the great supporting skills of Victor Francen and J. Carrol Naish. Lorre made his own human hand into a monster with his great acting talents, telling us all that mental illness can cause many things to happen within our very souls. The piano music pounded in my ears throughout this picture and the black and white effect made it a great thriller. Police inspector J Carrol Naish gave a great final touch to the ending of this picture, he gave us all a BIG LAUGH!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vintege horror at its very best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Beast with Five Fngers has to be one of the best classic horrors ever made, along with The Haunting (1963).A pianist is killed, possibly murdered after he falls down the stairs in his creepy mansion. After his death, strange things start happening including the piano playing on its own accord and the strange behaviour of the secretary. Then murders start to take place and these turn out to be the work of the pianist's severed hand, which haunts the mansion.With creepy music by Max Steinor, a howling wind and windows slamming open and shut, all these things make this movie very scary.The excellent cast includes a creepy performance by Peter Lorre (Mad Love, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea), Robert Alda, Andrea King and J Carrol Naish (The Monster Maker).This is a must for all horror fans. Excellent and scary.Rating: 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most unique and unusual music in the movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie should be much appreciated by anyone who plays, knows, or likes classic piano music. The piano music played with one hand only is amazing, exciting and bewildering. It is obviously a soundtrack but I feel the actor, and later on, the hand, do a wonderful job making the viewer believe that they are playing this fast tempo and highly complicated piece of piano music, possibly a concerto. I this movie to be overall a really great horror film.John Brousch</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More suspense than horror but a must-see for true fans of the genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classic early horror with Lorre in superb eye-popping form. Film is set in an Italian mansion where a wealthy pianist is close to death. When he passes away it turns out he has left everything in his will to his nurse, who incurs the wrath of the grasping relatives who have arrived. The bickering takes a sinister turn when the solicitor is strangled, seemingly by the severed hand of the dead pianist.Lorre plays the deranged librarian whose sightings of the hand send him increasingly over the edge into madness. Despite the true horror potential of the storyline, the film tends to play more like a murder mystery. Much of the atmosphere is wasted by the air of light-heartedness, particularly the contrived slap-happy ending.Misgivings aside, 'The Beast with Five Fingers' is still one of the genre making horrors, and while not in the same league as the heavyweight films of the 1930's like 'Frankenstein', 'The Invisible Man' or 'Mad Love', still rates serious attention.Other severed hands featured in ' Dr Terror's House of Horrors, 'Evil Dead II', and Oliver Stone's 'The Hand'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthwhile (6.0-7.0/10.0)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Beast With Five Fingers predates any other ?disembodied' hand film I've seen by a good twenty years. Such films include Dr. Terror's House Of Horror, The Hand, Evil Dead II, Severed Ties, and the two Addam's Family films and television series. This selection illustrates the gamut of horror film quality, from the delightful Evil Dead II to the atrocious Severed Ties. Happily, their precursor, The Beast With Five Fingers is ?hands down' one of the better entries in this sub-genre.The Beast? is set in an Italian village, home of the successful pianist, Francis Ingram, who resides in a sumptuous villa. Ingram is wheelchair bound as his entire right side is paralysed, and is forced to play piano using his single left hand. His style is suitably heavy and melancholic. He is a haunted figure, heavily reliant on his young nurse to the point of obsession, and fixated on his own death. Therefore, he summons his companions to dinner to witness the signing of his will. Amongst them is his personal secretary Hilary (Peter Lorre), a man with his own obsessions; astrology and the occult. It is not long before the Grim Reaper arrives as a belated dinner guest.The film's most prominent actor is Peter Lorre. Lorre's career in horror fare has seen a slight regression over the years, though not as profound as some of his contemporaries such as Bela Lugosi and John Carradine. In the Thirties, Lorre starred in Fritz Lang's classic M and the rather good Mad Love. However, by the Sixties he was resigned to playing second fiddle to Vincent Price in horror-comedies The Comedy Of Terrors and The Raven. These two films are reasonable enough but eclipsed by his formative work. The Beast? makes a fitting mid-point between these two eras.Lorre is an engaging actor, his childlike physique and strange manner always invoke some degree of viewer sympathy no matter how heinous his crimes (cf. M). J. Carrol Naish who plays the affable police inspector (yep, never heard of him before) is also notable but his more comedic moments do lessen the film's impact.The special effects used to animate the hand are impressive for their time, although as the film is in b&amp;w this helps mask its inadequacies somewhat. The rubber hand in Dr. Terror's House Of Horror is pitiable in comparison, and that was made twenty odd years later. The interplay between Lorre and the hand as he alternatively soothes and struggles with it are reminiscent of Ash's plight in Evil Dead II.*spoliers*The majority of the players seem primarily motivated by avarice. It is somewhat surprising then that the final bodycount is so low. A modern horror would have casually knocked off such ?sinners' with glee. Perhaps, this highlights a rift between ?vintage' and modern horror. The vintage film has a more human approach to its characters, although they do suffer in terms of danger and scares, they do not die. The usual modern approach is to emphasise the killings, the characters are just fodder for the killer's and the audience's whimsy. Of course this reasoning parallels the change in audience expectation and tolerance with time, and also what the changes the filmmakers could get away with in terms of censorship and ?decency'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Solid gothic melodrama featuring a killer hand -- or is it only killing in the mind of Hilary (Lorre)? Robert Alda is good as a not very straight leading man (he makes his first appearance selling "new antiques" to gullible tourists) and King is adquate as his lover with a secret connection to Hilary. Interestingly, this connection/conspiracy remains a mystery to the police and her lover when the film ends. Siodmak has crafted both an excellent psycho-drama in gothic style, and also a perfect vehicle for Lorre's exquisite theatrics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old Fashioned SCARY Movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the scariest movies I ever saw. It really plays with your mind. I admit that I first saw this movie as a kid int the back seat of my parent's car at the drive-in, and FOR YEARS, I was very afraid of the hand coming out from under sofas, beds and anywhere dark. It connects with something deep in the subconscious as the hand is the part of the body that does all things and in this movie it is a power all unto itself.The black and white film makes this movie a perfect expression of the subconscious, fearful and malevolent. Definitely one that I hope would eventually make it to DVD, and one to own if you're into the classics of this genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a gloomy 1900s mansion in Italy a famed pianist(Victor Francen)lives with his devoted nurse(Andrea King) and his faithful secretary(Peter Lorre). The wheelchair bound pianist is only able to use one hand to play. An antique dealer(Robert Alda)adapts a piece of music to be played with one hand to dull the musician's bitterness. Francen dies after a rolling tumble down a staircase leaving his fortune to his nurse. A couple of upset relatives arrive protesting the will; but this moves to the back burner when murder and attempted murder is committed by the dead pianist's severed hand. Plus the hand likes to play the piano which adds to the terror. Lorre nails the hand in a box; and even throws it in a fire after confrontations with the disembodied member. Local Commissario Castanio(J. Carrol Naish)investigates this creepy mystery. Lorre is outstanding in a passive demented way. His wrestling with the severed hand is hilarious. Max Steiner is responsible for the haunting score. Great black and white from Warner Brothers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has you on the edge of your seat. Its atmospheric direction is brilliant.The cast, too, is excellent: Andrea King, a damsel in distress but a little icy and with kind of an edge (and a hairstyle resembling a headdress0; Robert Alda as the wry romantic lead figure. And of course, Peter Lorre -- neurotic as ever (in roles he was cast in.)It's scary and has superb music and gorgeous photography.It does have two flaws: the illogical central conceit of a disembodied hand and the obvious casting of Lorre. Yes, he is excellent, but wouldn't it be nice to see him the hero occasionally, instead of the delusional, pathetic villain?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful performance by Peter Lorre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wealthy piano player who can no longer play is surrounded by parasitic people who survive on his beneficence. He, though, is bitter because of his loss of ability to play his beloved piano. Shortly after his death, when the others are arguing over his will, a number of murders occur and the locals believe they are committed by the severed hand of the dead man.The tale itself if fairly simple, though the ending is not totally clear until it occurs, which is a definite plus in this film. And there are good performances by Robert Alda, Andrea King and J. Carroll Naish. But it is Peter Lorre's performance that really makes this movie. In many ways similar to his role in "M" (though with a few significant differences), Peter Lorre brings a realness to the character of Hilary Cummins that few others could bring. I detested him, yet still felt some sympathy, which I think was necessary for this movie to work.Overall, a lesser known movie that is worth a viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth seeing for the acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first ten or fifteen minutes of "The Beast with Five Fingers," while the Victor Francen character is still alive with both hands intact, I find the most interesting, with the exception of the crawling-hand scenes. In a room filled with fascinating faces and powerful character actors like Lorre and David Hoffman, Francen commands the most attention as the willful, moody Francis Ingram. His talent is made the most of in his short time on screen, unlike Peter Lorre's, which seems somewhat wasted in a part that could have made much better use of his depth. Nothing Robert Alda says ever rings with sincerity to these ears--he always sounds like a smarmy car salesman or a drugstore Lothario, and it stretches credulity that Andrea King would want to run away with him rather than stay with the rich, talented Ingram. One thing about this film that cracks me up is that Andrea King's character, Julie, must be the deafest personal care attendant on the planet. Ingram shouts for her on at least three different occasions and she doesn't appear (for plot reasons). When he's calling from his bedroom after waking from some sort of attack, and then rolling down the hall in his wheelchair still calling, you'd think that his nurse would hear his pitiful cries!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Hand Clapping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one could have been a minor classic but got butchered by the studio in the editing room. Since the script is mediocre, and the actors, aside from Peter Lorre, not at their best, the movie is quite a letdown, but for two things: excellent special effects of a disembodied hand running around and committing mayhem; and Peter Lorre's bulging eyed performance as a deranged bookworm-astrologer with a, well, disembodied hand fixation. Director Robert Florey tries his best with the material, but fails to create the right pace and feeling for the film. Since Florey and Lorre were both highly gifted men, this is all the more frustrating, as there are flashes of real brilliance in the film for all that is wrong with it. All this goes to show that a good horror movie, like any other kind, has to be built from the ground up. I sense that Florey was so intrigued by the idea of a horror based on a the image of a severed hand that he forgot to make the rest of the movie work. This won't do. Frankenstein isn't just about its set pieces,--the lightning storm, the murders, the burning windmill--it's a story rooted in a time, a place and a community, that concerns credible characters behaving in ways that make sense (even if one doesn't subscribe to their values or care for their motivations). Dracula, similarly, has a certain sweep, beginning in the remote Carpathians of central Europe, then moving to England, as we get a sense of how Dracula stalks his prey, the way he treats people, and why. The Beast With Five Fingers strains credibility from the outset, then goes swiftly downhill. One waits for the big scenes, which do not disappoint, but the story overall is poorly developed, and there's no one to care for or identify with. The movie is an interesting experiment, and worth watching once, yet never lives up to its promise, and is a terrible waste of its brilliant star, who's in very good form throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seriously creepy "B" Horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anything Peter Lorre did I get on board for so when I had a chance to see this one...I jumped.A partially paralyzed concert pianist sits in his Italian castle all day and plays morose piano tunes whilst his nurse and weird astronomer friend sit idly by. He's a really creepy guy who's a bit off kilter but decides he's of enough sound mind to get his house mates and his 1 outside friend to sign off on his will. The nurse is emotionally exhausted having to take care of this guy so she decides to leave the house. Before this can happen the Pianist falls down the staircase and dies. After this comes the "whodunnit" part of the film and with this....it's where the real creepiness starts.Right off when you start this you'll recognize that this isn't a first rate production. By the actors alone you can see this but with the story they weave it really enhances the atmosphere that it's not on "A" list horror film. The real standout is Peter Lorre. He's heads and tails above any actor in this...and it shows. This guy made a real niche for himself playing these weird off-center type of guys. It was his looks, demeanor and personality all rolled into one that him the legend he is.Sit back on a dark night and watch this creepy little gem from the Warner lot. It's a "B" winner from any day and time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Lorre is almost the whole show...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... the rest of the show is J.Carrol Naish as the understated but determined Police Commissario Ovidio Castanio, and Victor Francen as Francis Ingram, a paralyzed concert pianist. Together they take a script that drags in spots and make it memorable with some great performances. The opening scene is rather misleading as it makes you think that this film is going to be about petty con man Conrad Ryler (Robert Alda) and the police official that recognizes but looks the other way at his somewhat crooked ways (J. Carroll Naish). It is not.The story quickly moves to the estate of invalid pianist Francis Ingram, his body completely paralyzed save his left hand, being cared for by his nurse Julie (Andrea King). Francis is obviously in love with her, but realizes the two could never have a real relationship. However, this doesn't prevent him from being horribly jealous of her. He has an eccentric private secretary (Peter Lorre as Hilary) who doesn't seem to be doing any work at all for Francis, instead he spends all of his time studying astrology. This is OK with Francis as he is busy studying Julie. All of this Gothic atmosphere leads up to Francis accidentally falling down the stairs to his death, his greedy estranged relatives arriving from England, and their discovery that Francis has written his nephew out of the will and given everything to his nurse Julie. True to the form of the one percent, these greedy relatives are not good sports about this and threaten to break the will even if they have to accuse Julie of murder - and all with the help of Francis' own lawyer who drew up the will in the first place - for a cut of the estate of course. The piano, locked since Francis' death, is heard to play at night yet nobody is around and the next morning the lawyer is found strangled dead. Later the greedy nephew almost meets the same fate. Some investigation by the police finds that Francis' one good hand is missing from his body. Is Francis' disembodied hand going about wreaking vigilante justice on those that are wronging him after death? Of course not! After all, this isn't Universal Studios, this is Warner Brothers, and there is a reasonable explanation. I'll let you watch and find out what that is.The last scene had me quite upset. Julie just signs over the estate to the greedy relatives and walks away from the whole thing, penniless. At least "the hand" could have done away with the two greedy relatives and let kind Julie keep what Francis intended her to have. I guess in the production code era, murder is wrong but greed is good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A handy little thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thanks to TCM for showing this film on a double-bill recently with Peter Lorre's earlier film MAD LOVE, which also involves a psycho and a piano player. It allowed me to savor Lorre's quite amazing talent for expressing character with his face and gestures.I wonder why Robert Alda was billed over Peter Lorre, since this was only Alda's fourth film, and Lorre was already an established star. No matter how you cut it, Lorre's character is the focus of the plot, while Alda and the girl are just the necessary Hollywood window dressing. Just as MAD LOVE let us watch Lorre work out his obsession with a beautiful woman, BEAST shows him working out his obsession with ideas and arcane knowledge. The film's slick trick is to make us think we're watching a horror movie (severed hand, eerie mausoleum), when maybe it's not really one at all.The score, using Bach's famous chaconne arranged for left hand, is inspired. The script, although weak in spots, contains a nice balance between light and dark material (except for the extremely lame "extra joke" at the end). Naish turns in another convincing ethnic performance, and the two greedy relatives are suitably slimy. The photography and special effects add extra doses of creepiness. Can you forget the scene with Lorre and the nail? P.S. As someone else has commented here, it was also fun to watch Robert Alda in a fairly extensive role, and see all the resemblances between him and his son. Voice, gesture, facial expressions...it's all there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One can regret the final "explanation" .A great fantasy and horror film does not need any "explanation" ,particularly when they feature an actor as gifted as Peter Lorre.Lorre is a so great an actor he can make you believe the hand does not really exist,it's him and only him who cannot control himself when madness really breaks out,just like M in Lang's magnum opus.The rest of the cast -with the exception of French Victor Francen who made films in America with Duvivier ("Tales of Manhattan" and Leisen "Hold back the dawn" )who really pulls it out as a wealthy disturbing greybeard in love with a truly beautiful girl (Andréa King deserves he name:she is gorgeous)- seems bland by comparison.The film takes place in Italy ,which is not exactly the right place for a Gothic tale in a spooky mansion.The first place when Robert Alda sells an "ancient" jewel to naive tourists seems a bit out of place .But no matter ,sit down,enjoy Lorre's sensational acting and get some scares....in the dark,of course.Like this?

		<shortDescription>"In my mind there is no doubt the hand is walking around."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just happened to watch this film back to back (or is it hand to hand?) with Peter Lorre's earlier classic "Mad Love" from 1935. Both feature severed hands contributing to the madness of the principal player, though in the case of this picture, there is more of a psychological angle at work in explaining the psychosis of Lorre's character Hilary Cummins. For even though Hilary can 'see' the disembodied hand at work and even attempts to subdue it, the real confrontation takes place only in his own mind.The story is built around the greed of family members who expect the reading of a will to go their way following the death of wealthy, wheelchair bound pianist (Victor Francen) with only one good hand. When the will provides only for the frustrated pianist's nurse (Andrea King) as sole heir, it sets in motion a devious plot by the dead man's brother-in-law and his son to have the will vacated and replaced with an earlier one in which they stood to inherit the bulk of the Ingram estate.The picture borrows from mystery plots of the era by introducing a secret lever in a bookcase revealing a hidden safe, as the disembodied hand seemingly makes a victim of the younger Arlington (John Alvin) heir. Had the idea not been used a thousand times before, the filmmakers might have used the old lights out trick along the way to promote further mayhem.With an understated but effective performance in the early going, Peter Lorre builds upon his character to deliver an elegantly crazed conclusion to the story as he tries locking the rampant hand away in a desk, and unsuccessful at that, actually tries nailing it in place! Considering the era, the crawling hand effect is particularly notable. Had I seen this as a kid it would have impacted me on the same level as "House on Haunted Hill", which is to say it creeped me out for some time.As I mentioned earlier, this was the second of two films I caught the other day on Turner Classics featuring Peter Lorre in stories about disembodied hands. The theme for the evening was 'rogue body parts', something I might not have considered left to my own imagination. Given the subject matter, I'd have to say that both flicks amounted to the best use of my time, hands down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hand of dead pianist Victor Francen seems to be haunting his mansion and especially Peter Lorre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Beast with Five Fingers" is really a well-done Warner Brothers movie from 1946. The cinematography is very good in conjunction with great sets and great lighting that captures the shadows in the mansion. The sound is excellent. One can hear every step when Robert Alda and Andrea King descend the big staircase. Although classified as horror, it's a film noir in my view also because of the way it focuses on the character of Peter Lorre becoming psychotic and his obsession; its structure as a mystery also contributes to this classification. Lorre's performance is absolutely first-rate. By the time we get to the end, the photography of his face and lighting are very expressionistic. J. Carroll Naish, always able to make any part interesting, plays a local police commissioner. Director Robert Florey typically does very good work and in this film, everything falls into place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Florid Florey At His Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apart from its title, its setting in the library and two or three incidents (the servants quitting, the hand being locked in the safe), the movie, "The Beast With Five Fingers" bears very little relationship to the Harvey story. If anything, the screenplay tells a more spine-chilling tale, and tells it more effectively. In fact, Peter Lorre contributes one of his most dramatically macabre portraits. He receives great support from Victor Francen's chilling study of an eccentric pianist. Some memorable bits from Pedro De Cordoba's surly innkeeper and David Hoffman's slimy lawyer also add to the atmosphere. On the other hand, after his promising opening scene, Robert Alda slips into the hackneyed emotions of a conventional hero. As for Andrea King, whilst she certainly makes an attractive heroine, her acting is not altogether convincing. And then there's J. Carroll Naish who seemingly can't make up his mind whether to play his role for chills or misplaced humor!Fortunately, while he has obviously concentrated less on his players, director Florey has brought the film in with a fair amount of visual style. In fact, in at least two or three instances, Florey's direction is so compellingly inventive, it's impossible to take your eyes from the screen. McGann's masterly special effects are also compellingly realistic, while ever-reliable Max Steiner has contributed a music score as moodily atmospheric as his "Most Dangerous Game" or "King Kong".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Enough, But It's A Suspense Movie More Than Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would recommend this film for the performances of the leads more than anything. Peter Lorre, Robert Alda and Andrea King all did very well with their parts. Lorre, as Hilary (personal assistant to disabled but famed pianist Francis Ingram, played by Victor Francen), was really tailor made for this type of film, playing a suspicious and even somewhat creepy character. Alda (as a sort of con artist named Conrad Ryder, whose relationship with Ingram I never really did understand) and King (as Ingram's personal nurse Julie) were both much better known for their television roles than for movies, but both did well with their parts.The story revolves around Ingram, his "friendships" (for lack of a better word) with the three aforementioned characters, and others who become suspicious when Ingram dies in an accident - his wheelchair having fallen down a staircase - and leaves his entire estate to Julie. In the midst of some concerns about the will, Ingram's only two living family members show up and challenge the will. The title then begins to make sense, as what is apparently Ingram's disembodied hand begins a murderous rampage.This worked fairly well as a suspense movie, but I wouldn't call it a "horror" movie. I never believed (well, perhaps I had a shade of doubt for a moment, but it didn't last long) that there was really a disembodied hand on the loose. Clearly, there was another explanation. We just had to wait for it to be revealed. It was a decent enough story. There was nothing spectacular about it, but it's certainly not a failure. It featured some pretty decent special effects (for the time) with the disembodied hand, but it made a huge mistake in the last scene, suddenly trying to be funny, which was out of keeping with the entire story up to that point and which actually left me a bit dry. I didn't see the need for that "humourous" ending - which wasn't that funny anyway, and which was entirely out of place. Still, it's a decent enough movie to watch. (5/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As one of my friends remarked while we were watching "Beast","I can't tell if I'm watching a good movie...or a bad one." That pretty much sums up this movie for me. Beautifully shot, nice moody sets and lighting, and strong performances from a cast playing mostly unlikeable characters following a drunkard's walk of a plot.Lorre, as usual, is simultaneously fascinating, pathetic, sinister and pitiful. Alda plays a "hero" who is something of a rogue and conman, comes off as "good" only when compared to the greedy heirs who show up after the rich guy dies...and yet the younger heir, though greedy and slimy, is somehow still likable and sympathetic. The nurse/heiress is a standard Barbie doll, cast against her will into the role of "gold-digger" who then decides to embrace it,and also hides important information from the police. And Naish plays a "commisario" with a light touch (almost comic relief,especially at the end) which doesn't quite mesh with the rest of the film. It's a polished, nuanced performance that makes me want to punch him in the face more than once.So the cast and characters make for an odd mix, and the plot starts out as a mystery, moves over into suspense for a bit, and then tries to jump the tracks into horror, only to pull back and tell the audience, "Nah, just kidding" in the last 10 minutes. Siodmak,a fine writer,just couldn't quite make his material cohere in this particular instance.But the film is worth seeing, if only for Lorre's performance and the special effects for the "hand",which work very well in the context of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the movie I only would hold up one ... my thumb up to be exact! Another Bunuel movie that delivers and another Bunuel movie, that has obsession as a main theme. This time spiced up with suspense and horror! Of course Mr. Lorre does deliver fully, even playing with his image (if you know his other movies, especially one little known movie called "M" ... ;o) ) Seriously though the performances are great throughout (although some might find them too much/theatrical) and the story is told in a way, that it keeps you on your toes. Even if you know where it is heading, it still delivers. Music and cinematography do their best to elevate this as much as possible too. I liked it and it is/was just another proof of Bunuels genius ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing this movie at about 5 years old, in the mid-Sixties, was a mind-bendingly terrifying experience! Scariest thing I ever saw as a kid, and one of the few movies that truly gave me nightmares. The idea of a mindless, relentless, killing-machine hand (which also could hide in any dark nook or cranny) made every other horror movie seem tame by comparison.For some reason it never seemed to play on TV where I lived after that, so I didn't see it again for at least another 20 years, when it came out on VHS. (Though, admittedly, it so terrified me I'd of avoided watching it again at all costs!) When it came out on VHS I bought it, mostly out of a morbid curiosity over what had so frightened me as a kid. I was pleased to find "The Beast with Five Fingers had held up surprisingly well over the years. While no longer terrifying, I found it was still quite creepy and atmospheric. As for the "special effects", they're a mixed bag. The scenes using the obviously mechanical hand don't come off very convincingly, but the others using a real hand are very good. I can only imagine what it must have took in the 1940's to process each frame to eliminate all but the actor's hand from the image. Glad they went to the time and trouble.Everyone remembers the memorable "confrontation" scene in the study between Peter Lorre and the hand; not only is it handled well throughout, but the build-up is terrific: eerie grating soundtrack, popping in the fireplace, and the strings of the violin on the wall snapping! And this movie, like other greats, shows how much more effective black and white photography can be. I just can't imagine a movie like this in color.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Beast with Five Fingers is directed by Robert Florey and jointly written by Curt Siodmak and William Fryer Harvey. It stars Robert Alda, Andrea King, Peter Lorre, Victor Francen, J. Carrol Naish, Charles Dingle, John Alvin and David Haffman. Music is by Max Steiner and cinematography by Wesley Anderson. Francis Ingram (Francen) is a well regarded pianist who after suffering a stroke leaves him paralysed on one side, chooses to live at an isolated manor in rural Italy. After he calls family and carers together for the reading of his will, tragedy strikes and something sinister begins to stalk the manor house... Wonderfully weird, a blend of guignol, noir, expressionism and cheese, The Beast with Five Fingers delivers rich rewards for those not expecting a horror masterpiece. Following the classic "old dark house" formula, plot basically sees the characters introduced, their means and motives deliberately grey, tragedy strikes and then the titular beast of the title comes into play. Cue characters getting bumped off, some shouting, some eerie scenes and then the mystery solved. All of which is set to the backdrop of a typical mansion of many rooms and doors, an imposing staircase and of course a grand piano. Florey stitches it together neatly, Anderson provides some striking photography that embraces shadows and deals in odd angles, while Lorre does yet another film stealing performance involving twitchy weasel like mania. A stupid tacked on coda soils things a touch, and you really have to have a bent for this type of creaky chiller, but it is great fun and it "pointed" the way for other "beastly hand" tales that followed down the line. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not perfect, but for all it's defects THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS holds up very well after sixty years.Victor Francen is a famous concert pianist, who had a stroke. He lives in an Italian villa, with his American nurse (Andrea King) and his secretary (Peter Lorre). Lorre is using Francen's extensive occult library to do a study concerning the laws of fate. Those books are very important to him. Into the group comes antique dealer and minor composer Robert Alda, who somewhat gets into Franken's good graces by composing a piece of music for him that he can play with his one good hand.Francen has a confrontation with Lorre over his estate, and it's valuable library. In the confrontation, he nearly strangles Lorre with his good hand (keep in mind the hand has all the strength both hands used to have). Later, Francen falls down the staircase when he is going down in the darkness. He dies, and his will reveals that King was left the estate. Enter John Alvin and Charles Dingle, Francen's nephew and brother-in-law, who claim the estate as next of kin. The lawyer for Francen (David Hoffman) tells them about an earlier will that did leave the estate to Alvin. He is murdered that night, and the local police chief (J. Carroll Naish) is called in. And here the situation takes on it's spooky aspect: the strangle marks resemble Francen's fingerprints. Soon it is discovered that Francen's good hand has been cut off his corpse in his tomb.What follows (I find) is a good atmospheric horror film of the type that was followed in the 1930s and 1940s. The turn of the century Italian background is well set (there is even a full portrait of King Umberto I of Italy, who was assassinated in 1900, on the wall of Naish's office). The characters are all slowly coming to the conclusion that the nocturnal concerts on the piano downstairs, the various attacks on the suspects, and the pieces of damage found on windows and in the rooms of the villa are due to Francen's hand. Gradually the audience wonders about this. A more logical explanation is finally produced at the end, but as a matter of fact the film does leave the supernatural issue in the air.The performances are good, and Lorre's is superb. In the long run we are not certain if the latter is going mad when he hears the music and sees the disembodied hand, or if he actually is confronting a unique monster. This ambivalence, although somewhat laughed at in the conclusion, holds up the center of the film. Naish does well as the detective, surprising his suspects when they least expect it. Dingle is as competent in his characterization (here not as villainous as usual as he is a caring father). Francen always was suave and superb, as villain or normal type - here one sympathizes with is crippled artist going mad. King normally played patrician bitches, but here she has a chance to be the heroine for a change. Alda too is okay, although unsettling. With his hair dark he looks too much like his son Alan.The special effects regarding the disembodied hand are also good - one can see the veins in the hand that were cut when it was removed from the body. But it is not the only thing that looks disembodied. Shot in black and white, the scene towards the end when a deranged Lorre enters the room of one of the characters has his head appear to be floating in a sea of darkness - possibly symbolizing how his mind is going astray.Still a very worthy horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Betrayal of the Beast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Contains mild spoilers) How a good mystery story with horror elements could evolve to a disappointing resolution, with J. Carrol Naish overacting as comic relief, and Andrea King and Peter Lorre wrestling with absurd scenes and dialogue, I cannot explain. The first and second acts contain a few of the best B&amp;W images of the history of horror cinema that I can remember, especially all scenes involving the mad pianist played by Victor Francen until his magnificently staged death, or the moment when the Beast demands its ring to Lorre. With the exception of his avant garde silent films, I don't place the work of French director Robert Florey too high, but I must admit he made a remarkable job in this film, until the story began to turn into a tale of dementia. When the schizophrenic hallucination galore started, the movie fell into the trap of psychological melodrama and never recovered. Naish in his final scenes made it worse, unsuccessfully trying to make us laugh. Maybe it was studio interference as I have read, or maybe screenwriter Curt Siodmak did not delivered a very inspired script. But from the moment in the middle of the night when the dead pianist's young American relative runs terrified to the garden, followed by his father, the police commissioner and the leading man, the film sinks fast: inside the house King and Lorre go into an endless interplay, he threatens to kill her and the hand goes nuts over the piano, while no one comes back to the house. Although it has become a cult favorite, it is a pity that it did not turned into a winner because it had all the elements to be a genre classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The real stars of the film are the art director (Fleischer) and the set director (Tilford). That cavernous house is one spooky nightmare with its swooping staircase and elaborate décor. Gloom hangs over the mansion like a big suffocating blanket. I'm thinking the lighting bill couldn't have been more then a dollar-fifty. No wonder Hilary (Lorre) goes mad, imagining all sorts of strange things as he caresses his sinister old books.To my mind, the movie's biggest horror is when Hilary threatens to knife the beauteous Julie (King). Was there ever a Hollywood actress with more aristocratic cheekbones than Andrea King. I suspect she was a little too icy-looking for real stardom. Nonetheless, catch her strong presence in Ride the Pink Horse (1947).It's a florid production, heavy on atmosphere along with Hilary's growing madness, but especially on the thunderous Max Steiner score that was apparently recorded at the bottom of a deep well. The creeping hand effect is well done, along with the striking long shot of it pounding the ivories like a concert from heck.But why give the whole gimmick a real world solution when the supernatural alternative is so much more fun. And what genius was responsible for the wink-and-nod last frame, with the Commisario (Naish) showing us it's really only a movie. Did some studio producer think we really needed convincing. Too bad since breaking character harms the carefully crafted atmosphere. My advice is to enjoy the good part before switching off the last ten minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** After having a stoke which had him lose the use of his right hand world famous pianist Francis Ingram, Victor Frances, became the left handed wounder of the music world. Ingram was now able to master and even improve the very difficult Bach Chaconne in D minor with one hand tackling the ivories. Ingram after months and months of tireless practice was single handedly able to accomplish this amazing feat better the most concert pianists could do with both their hands.It's when Ingram got on the outs with his creepy secretary Hillary Commins, Peter Lorre, that strange things began to happen at the Ingram Mansion. One of those things was Ingrm falling or being pushed down a flight of stairs and ending up dead with a broken neck! It's when Ingram's last will and testament was read that friction developed between Hilary and Ingram's only living relatives Mr. Arlington, Charles Dingle, and his son Donald, John Alvin. Not that Hilary and the Arlington's were disputing what the late Ingram left to them but the fact that he left all his worldly possessions to his nurse Julie Holden, Andrea King!It wasn't much later that the lawyer in the Ingram estate proceedings Durex, David Hoffman, was found strangled with the murderer's fingerprints belonging to the dead Francis Igram's left hand!Was it Ingram's hand that somehow detached itself from his body that did Durex in or was somebody using Inram's had to do his dirty work in murdering the now deceased lawyer! That job, finding Durex's killer, was left up to both Julie's boyfriend American con artist Bruce Conrad, Robert Alda, and local village police commissioner Ovidio Castiio,J Carrol Naish.***SPOILERS*** It soon becomes apparent to everyone watching that "The Hand" is the real McCoy in seeing it crawl all over the mansion and even play the piano, playing Bach's concerto, in its spear time. The secret to "The Hand's" strange powers is known only to the creepy Hilary who in his study of the black arts has found, or thinks he has, the secrets of both life death and the workings of the vast and mysterious universe in the books left to him in Ingram's secret occult library! As"The Hand" gets more and more daring in coming out into the open Young Donlad Arlington sufferers a complete emotional breakdown. The last we see of a terrified Donald, when he's confronted by "The Hand", is him running out of the Ingram Mansion stark raving mad and screaming hysterically at the top of his lungs! In the end it's Bruce Conrad as well as Police Commissioner Castanio who cracks the secret of "The Hand" and what exactly it had to do with the case of Duprex's murder and Donald's insanity. Something that the by now completely out of his skull Hilary, who was manipulating "The Hand" since his boss Imngram's death, was soon to find out the hard way. By him trying to put "The Hand" out of commission before, with "The Hand" now turning on Hilary, it did a job on him!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following the death of their charge, a group of friends staying in his Italian villa become convinced his disembodied hand is committing a series of gruesome murders around the house and try to stop it before they're all killed.This here was quite an enjoyable and fun effort. What really gives this one a great feel here is the exceptional build-up here to the actual revelation, which comes off really nicely here without giving off a really boring pace. The early part of this one is a great build-up of the mysterious death of their boss and the general resentment of everyone towards his intentions following the reading of the will which gives this a really solid base once it moves to the haunting stages. These here are all quite fun as the hand gets quite inventive here with some spectacular scenes of the disembodied hand coming out from around corners, behind curtains and statues to attack without warning only to disappear without a trace and then to immediately begin playing the piano makes for some creepy times here, and several other big stalking scenes that come about showing it walking about which give off a really fine touch. There's even a great deal of detective work on display here as the middle parts here revolve very nicely around determining the course of actions within here which follow through the group exploration of the tomb where they find the initial disturbances where the hand has gotten loose and left the evidence of its disappearance as well as bringing about the start of the regular investigations. The scenes of the group wandering around the house following each of the attacks where the earlier clues here about trying to get to the other will while trying to solve the murders leads to the secret room in the library and the further realization of the tricks used to pull it off are revealed given the introduction of the hoax at the center of it all. It's a strong enough concept here that this one is indeed good enough here that there's a lot to like over the film's few problems. The biggest issue here is in fact the film's final twist, something which not only renders what's going on here completely arbitrary but also is revealed in a really clueless way, unfurling it without much suspicion by the sole member of the household who has been informed the least by what's happening and really taking a lot of sting out of the film. It's not really as clever as it thinks it is because of this, and really tends to downplay a lot of what happened here. As well, there's also the endings' jokey nature tends to really conflict with the more serious efforts here in the rest of the film, but it's more the twist here holding this one down.Today's Rating/PG: Violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wealthy wheelchair-bound pianist (Victor Francen) with a nasty temper is murdered. As the police investigate, more murders occur and soon suspicion falls on the unlikeliest of suspects: the pianist's severed hand!Stories involving disembodied hands that kill people have been around for a long time. I think this is the first such movie made with this theme and, for my money, it's the best. Robert Alda (father of Alan Alda) plays the slightly cynical hero of the film. He does fine except for the romantic stuff with lovely Andrea King. That part of the movie is weak but, to be fair, it almost always was in these types of films. The real stars are the wonderful character actors making up the rest of the cast. Peter Lorre, unsurprisingly, steals every scene with a gripping performance. Any movie with J. Carrol Naish in it is always worth checking out. Venerable Victor Francen does a fantastic job. Charles Dingle is hissable as only he could be. Wonderful atmospheric direction from Robert Florey with a nice screenplay by Curt Siodmak. One of the best horror movies of the '40s NOT made by Universal or RKO. Warner Bros. didn't make many horror movies back in the day but, judging by this film, maybe they should have. Definitely one you will want to see if you're a fan of horror/thriller films from the period.</fullReview>

After All, the Post War Years Saw a More Mature Audience and the Horror Genre had Seen its Better Days. Abbot and Costello Meets Frankenstein (1948) was to Come Shortly.Then there's that Goofy Title. It Conjures Up All Kinds of Things that were Not to Be. It's Just Clunky. The Premise and Execution were Ripe for Laughter and it is a Wonder the Movie Worked at All. But it Did.Thanks Mostly to Peter Lorre and Director Robert Florey's Atmospherics with Some Help from Max Steiner's Score. The SFX are Unbelievably Believable. Folks who Saw this One as Youngsters Usually Say it Scared Them Under the Covers. The Tone is Ominous and Played Melodramatically Straight (until the last five minutes).There are Chills and Thrills if You Get Into It and the Film has a Gothic Creepiness. The Hand Shows Some Gore and Manages to be Horrific at Times. Overall, Worth a Watch. May Be a Bit Overrated but it is an Anomalous Film from the Studio and the Era. Different Enough to be Sure and Stands Apart from its Contemporaries, what Few there were.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Beast With Five Fingers" is a 1946 Gothic horror film set in a large villa near an Italian village. Soon after pianist Francis Ingram's death, a series of mysterious events haunt his friends and relatives as they fight for control over the estate. Ingram's piano suddenly plays music in the middle of the night. A mysterious light glows in Ingram's mausoleum. Ingram's attorney is choked to death. Evidence points to Ingram's disembodied hand as the culprit.The standout performance in the film is by Peter Lorre, who plays a man driven to insanity. Lorre's character Hilary Cummins is the center of a big reveal roughly halfway through the movie that's wonderfully creepy and bizarre. "The Beast With Five Fingers" has the most energy and life whenever Lorre is at the center. The film lags, however, whenever it turns to the subplots of the the other characters. Lorre shines amidst all that flat, wooden acting.My biggest issue with "The Beast With Five Fingers" occurs when the film abruptly ends and takes a jokey, humorous tone that undermines the suspense of the rest of the movie. One of the characters suddenly turns to the camera, addresses the audience and laughs at how unbelievable the events of the film are. I don't understand the point here ? the quick explanation in the final reveal feels unearned and the unexpected break with the fourth wall feels bizarre. Despite these issues, "The Beast With Five Fingers is worth seeing for Lorre's performance and its creepy, Gothic atmosphere.</fullReview>

Oliver Stone remade it as "The Hand", starring Michael Caine as a cartoonist whose hand gets chopped off but doesn't stay dead (this was early in Stone's career, so the movie has nothing political).So, this one is just some good old-fashioned Gothic horror, including a trick at the end.

The story centers on a grouchy old one-handed pianist who's dying and leaves his assets to a beautiful young woman he loves, but stiffs everyone else in his circle. There are some flashes of chilling mood established by director Robert Florey, but not enough to make it a good solid horror classic. The most chilling moments involve a demented Peter Lorre, who's a delight as the pianist's former spurned secretary, who begins to see the dead man's severed hand tormenting him at every turn. It's always a pleasure to have J. Carrol Naish on hand in a film, but he's underused here as a police inspector, and is also saddled with a really silly epilogue. **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

Soon some unscrupulous relatives show up to claim his estate. A battle begins but people start hearing his piano playing in the dead of night and someone has cut off his hand which seems to be roaming around the house killing people. The local police chief (J. Carrol Naish) tries to figure out what's going on.I remember seeing this as a kid on TV and the disembodied hand moving around freaked me out. My dad said he saw it in a theatre when he was about 10 and he was so frightened he hid under the seat! Seeing it now it doesn't scare me but it's not bad. It's low budget but pretty well made. The acting is good with Lorre especially going at it full force. The special effects with the disembodied hand are good even by today's standards. The violence isn't that strong but there is a scene in Lorre's encounter with the hand that had me cringing! No great shakes but a somewhat creepy little horror film. I give it a 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film when I was a child and was absolutely terrified. The image of the hand walking across the floor has stayed with me all these years and I loved it!!! It also introduced me to Peter Lorre who was always one of my favourite actors. His menacing features and air of wickedness are features which have never been replicated by any other actor, either in his generation or later. I think the memory of the hand playing the piano was responsible for my taking up the violin as a child, but I would like to see the film again, to see if it is still scary or just amusing. As they say, They don't make films like that anymore. Who needs graphics!The black and white photography added a dimension which is lacking in modern colour films - dark, brooding, realistic. The setting in Italy gave the story a touch of the exotic. In the forties we would never have dreamt that we could go to such places, except in the stalls of the cinemas, where we found something which made our lives richer and took us away for a short time from the post-war situation which our parents had to cope with.Although the story was not in itself very complicated or philosophical, the sheer tension made it something which could be regarded as material for nightmares.Another great attribute was the pace of the film. As in many American pieces, the plot was not delayed by unnecessary dialogue or irrelevant detail. The story was clear, uncomplicated and direct. What more could one ask?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Beast with Five Fingers isn't the best forties horror film that I've seen; but it's a more than passable little horror/mystery flick that features some very good special effects and a trio of great performances from its leading actor. Robert Florey's film focuses on both atmosphere and plot line, and the result is a film that works both on a stylistic and intriguing level. The idea behind the plot is a mostly original one, and although it's one that has been used in a number of films since the release of this one (most notably, Evil Dead II), I can't think of a film that features a disembodied murderous hand that was released before 1946. The film takes place in an Italian village and focuses on a mansion owned by a rich pianist. He lives there with a number of people who don't seem to like him too much. After he dies by falling (or being pushed) down the stairs, some of the residents of his are murdered. The locals begin to believe that the perpetrator is not among the living and is, in fact, the severed hand of the deceased pianist...Director Robert Florey obviously values atmosphere in a film, and The Beast with Five Fingers benefits from a 'haunted house' style, which includes any number of creaking doors, howling winds and slamming windows. The central plot which involves a murderous severed hand is also very well implemented into the film, and the director does well at showing it as often as possible, and the result is always stunning. Peter Lorre was one of the film's main draws for me; and he certainly doesn't disappoint, as the star of great films such as M and Mad Love delivers another sinister and brilliant performance here. Lorre is joined by a great ensemble cast, and standing out the most are Robert Alda and Andrea King. The plot focuses on the mystery behind the killings at first and leads the audience into believing that a ghost is at work before revealing something more sinister at the conclusion with a great couple of twists. There's not a lot of humour during the film, and I have to say that the ending itself annoyed me. Despite the fact that the film has been serious throughout, Robert Florey has, for some reason, seen fit to have a little joke at the end...which I felt was out of place. Still, this is a great slice of atmospheric horror and therefore comes recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>VICTOR FRANCEN was one of my favorite character actors at Warner Bros. during the Golden Years ('40s mostly), and here he had a key role as a musician facing imminent death who writes a will leaving all of his legacy to his loyal caretaker ANDREA KING, rather than any close relatives.PETER LORRE is his librarian/secretary who considers himself owner of all the rare books in Francen's collection. ROBERT ALDA is a musician friend without much money of his own and an eye for King's affections. CHARLES DINGLE and JOHN ALVIN are the distant relatives who show up to contest the will. And J. CARROL NAISH is a detective who wants to know why there are mysterious things afoot in the spooky mansion where a hand seems to have a mind of its own in disposing of people by strangulation. Lorre plays the frightened victim with utmost skill, by now having perfected his screen persona to the point where his mere appearance on screen is enough to send the shivers through an audience. And the story, as absurd as it is, has you wondering whether this was a case of mind over matter--or whatever. It's never really clear how everything was carried out.But that won't stop you from enjoying this neat little thriller. Max Steiner's score adds to the suspense when necessary and everyone plays it straight so the tale has some credibility despite the foolishness of the main premise.Nothing really special, but it does have atmosphere and suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Francis Ingram, paralyzed in a recent accident holds the occupants of his mansion in a grip of fear. When he dies, a series of murders ensue and the only clues point to Ingram's left hand as the cause. The people in the house wonder is it the hand or some other sinister force at work. This movie was a huge disappointment due to its awful directing and script. Really a waste of Lorre's talent and J. Carroll Naish's performance as the police inspector. Rating 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memorable Moments . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Lorre's confrontation scenes with the "hand" are unforgettable impressions one is not likely to forget. Thanks to an excellent Max Steiner score (with the help of Bach) a fine eerie atmostphere and quite adequate acting, "The Beast With Five Fingers" is a fascinating minor horror story. The script, with time lags and uneven dialogue, together with the likewise uneven direction, keeps the action from being pertinent all the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiration for the Addams Family?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK this movie might not excel in originality, in fact it is more of a whodunit mystery than outright horror. The horror moments all come from the cut of hand from the deceased pianist Francis Ingram. When he dies all of his fortune goes to his caretaker Julie much to the displeasure of Francis' nephew Donald and brother-in-law Raymond Arlington who are sure there must exist a previous will which stipulated all possessions went to Donald. Several people who want the heritage get suspicious of each other when a murder takes place. Things get really weird when bookkeeper Hilary, masterfully played by Peter Lorre says it was Francis' cut of hand responsible for the murders. Is it only in Hilary's imagination or not, the scenes with the living hand are brilliant. This might be where the maker of the Addams Family got his inspiration from to create the living hand named "Thing". Robert Alda who plays Francis' best friend Conrad kind of resembles Gomez Addams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Five fingers?!? Oh, the horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fortunate enough to stumble upon a copy of "The Beast with Five Fingers" at a friend's house, especially because it has been on my must-see list since many years now. First and foremost because it stars Peter Lorre, and he inarguably was one of the greatest actors in the history in the history of horror cinema, and also a bit out of curiosity to see what the "Five Fingers" actually signifies. After all, last time I checked we all have five. It's pretty clear straight from the beginning that the plot of the film is rather complex, with the introduction of several characters and the convoluted liaisons connecting them. The pivot figure is a wealthy wheelchair-bound pianist who invited several people to his mansion to overhear the reading of his will. There's the local fraud, the pianist's secretary (Lorre) and the private nurse Julie who everyone appears to have a crush on. The pianist suddenly decided to leave all his possessions to his muse the nurse. When he then dies the next night and the actual heirs find out about the sudden testament change, they plot to fight the last-minute change in a court of law. But the spirit of Francis Ingram is determined about his inheritance going to the nurse and sends out his dead hand (!) to grisly murder those who try to argue with it. Silly premise, of course, and one that unfold itself very slowly, but a classic film such as this is made worthwhile thanks to the uncanny atmosphere and wonderfully eloquent dialogs. And, as stated above, thanks to the presence of Peter Lorre, who's as humble yet menacing as ever. I always found it fascinating how a short-sized and seemingly pitiable man could look so scary. The scenario, courtesy of the multi-talented Curk Siodmak ("The Wolf Man", "I walked with a zombie") is compelling enough to have you overlook all the tiny shortcomings and illogicalness. The murders are spooky enough, especially thanks to the stylistic aspects like eerie music and classy photography. Very adequate and fancy special effects for such an old film, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So close to being a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If not for the Production Code-imposed cop-out ending, The Beast With Five Fingers would surely be considered a horror classic--and even with that horrific comedy conclusion, it remains the best American horror film of the 1940s. It's also a rare thriller from Warner Brothers, rendering the result even more miraculous and surprising. Other reviews have sufficiently detailed the plot and applauded the special effects--which truly are impressive--so I will instead praise the astonishing cinematography of Wesley Anderson, whose short resume belies his obvious talent. Every shot drips Gothic atmosphere, the lighting is fantastic, and shots are carefully set up to emphasise the depth and detail of the set design. Quite simply, if you enjoy the Italian gothics of Mario Bava, take a look at this film. As for the cast, Peter Lorre is outstanding, Robert Alda passable, and J. Carroll Naish--well, I'm a Naish fan, but his goofy accent kept making me think I was actually watching Henry Armetta, and he got saddled with delivering THAT ENDING.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Thrills Or Chills In This Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, I couldn't believe how overrated this film turned out to be.....really disappointing. How it gets such high marks with critics is puzzling. Maybe they favored it because one of the main characters was an astrologist and anything that's occult-like is going to get points with them.Whatever. The fact remains this film commits the ultimate sin for a horror film: it's not scary! It's too talky and too boring, despite the presence of the usually- creepy Peter Lorre.One positive note: the special-effects people did a fine job with the hand. For something done 60 years ago, this "effect" still looks pretty cool.Nonetheless, a horror film should send a few chills your way, and this doesn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS (Robert Florey, 1946) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This proved to be Warners' sole foray into the horror genre during the 1940s after a handful of variable efforts made in the previous decade (the John Barrymore vehicles SVENGALI and THE MAD GENIUS {both 1931}, the two-strip Technicolor showcases DOCTOR X {1932} and MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM {1933}, both featuring stalwarts Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray, and the black-and-white sequel THE RETURN OF DR. X {1939}, with an ill-at-ease Humphrey Bogart).Though third-billed after romantic leads Robert Alda and Andrea King, Peter Lorre was obviously the star here ? his own third stab at the popular form, following MAD LOVE (1935; produced by MGM) and THE FACE BEHIND THE MASK (1941; a Columbia picture also directed by Florey), and to which he would briefly return towards the end of his career at AIP. Lorre, in fact, was a staple of Warner's typical noir-ish style of the era (in which THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS itself is shot) ? beginning with the classic THE MALTESE FALCON (1941) and continuing in his other films with either Humphrey Bogart or Sydney Greenstreet; actually, this was his only solo vehicle at that studio and, like the actor's earlier afore-mentioned genre turns, he not only carries it with aplomb but delivers a memorable performance.While the film is ideal Halloween fare (I watched a number of horror-related stuff throughout October in conjunction with my ongoing Luis Bunuel retrospective), it also forms part of that tribute to the Spanish Surrealist master because he claimed to have supplied Warners ? while employed there during his American exile ? with an idea for a motion picture about a rampaging disembodied hand, which they rejected at the time but eventually found itself on the screen anyway (though the story was attributed to somebody else)!; that said, he would have his revenge by 'appropriating' the device for himself ? using it within a surreal context ? for one of his major works i.e. THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962), with the result being clearly much superior to its 'inspiration'! For the record, other 'appearances' of the titular 'monster' are to be found in: THE WITCH'S MIRROR (1960), a cult item emanating from Mexico; the low-budgeter THE CRAWLING HAND (1963); the Amicus horror compendium DR. TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS (1965); the 1960s TV series and 1990s film versions of THE ADDAMS FAMILY; the Oliver Stone-Michael Caine dud THE HAND (1981); and, most recently, TRICK 'R TREAT (2007; which I have just watched).To get back to the subject at hand (no pun intended), the phoney European setting of THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS seems to have been influenced by that seen in the second phase of Universal horrors; even so, a good deal of the action takes place inside a sprawling villa ? which, ironically, not only looks back to the 'animated' mansion from the French Poe adaptation THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER (1928; on which Bunuel himself had served as Assistant Director) but forward to the endless spate of Mexi-Horrors often revolving around a gloomy hacienda (let's not forget that Bunuel spent almost 20 years rebuilding his film-making career in Mexico). Anyway, we get plenty of brooding atmosphere here ? with the special effects dealing with the murderous limb being reasonably effective for their time; still, while the Max Steiner score was appropriately moody (particularly the main theme that, for plot purposes, recurs throughout), I was a bit distressed by how similar it sounded to the same composer's distinctive work on the Howard Hawks/Humphrey Bogart noir masterpiece THE BIG SLEEP which, though begun in 1944, was only released ? after considerable re-shooting ? just a few months prior to THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS itself! The cast the of film under review also highlights J. Carroll Naish as the Police Commissioner of the traditionally superstitious Italian village and Victor Francen as the exacting crippled pianist (encouraged in his illusions by impoverished composer Alda, cared for by lovely nurse King ? who, naturally, arouses jealousy between the two ? and assisted in his affairs by scholar/secretary Lorre, though too often finding himself on the receiving end, both physically and psychologically, of the old man's uncontrolled fury). When King is revealed as Francen's heir ? over his only living relatives ? immediately before his death from a staircase fall, foul play is suspected and Naish is called in; however, dead-of-night piano-playing suggests the involvement of the supernatural and, sure enough, the pianist's hand is discovered missing from his coffin! Lorre is particularly tormented by the latter, but he eventually manages to nail it down and lock it away in Francen's safe; ultimately, though, the culprit for the various goings-on at the villa emerges to be no more than human ? with the depredations of the creeping hand attributed to his unbalanced mind (this disappointingly conventional ending, then, is augmented by an even lamer gag in which Naish uncharacteristically jokes around with the audience about the improbability of such a tall tale occurring)! In conclusion, this came off rather better than I recalled (I had not watched it in a long time) ? even if, as I already explained, its reputation as a minor genre classic mainly boils down to Lorre's presence and the distinctive Warners style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit of a drag but still a good watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie isn't the greatest told movie but it features more than enough, also original, elements in it to make this a perfectly good enough movie to watch.The way things unravel just isn't done in the best fashion. The movie is tense at times but considering the concept and story of the movie, the actual movie itself should- and definitely could had been more tense and better. The movie could had been more horror and that way the movie would had perhaps also been better known.The movie also isn't the fastest going movie, which of course was consistent with '40's movie-making style but this movie just takes too long before things start off. It also remains too vague for too long in which direction the movie is heading. The movie begins as a typical drama, set inside a typical rich man's house but then horror elements start to appear in the movie, though the more dramatic approach and way of storytelling (also with its characters) keep playing the most important role in the movie. It's a combination that just doesn't always feel right and it also doesn't always work out.The movie is still worth watching because of two simple reasons. 1; the atmosphere and 2; the acting. The atmosphere is totally fantastic in its more horror like aspects of the movie. It's the sort of both tense and mysterious atmosphere. The movie also definitely gets uplifted by its fine acting. Peter Lorre's role seems insignificant at first but he gets more important and is more prominently in the movie as the story heads toward its ending. His acting is superb as always and seems to be in a totally different kind of league in his style of acting as most of his colleague's working in the same time. A Peter Lorre performance is always unique and effective. It seemed like J. Carrol Naish had seen a bit too many detective movies before though, his performance was more comical than effective, though I have the feeling that this was done on purpose.The movie also uses some good effects to bring the hand to life. I really have no idea how they brought that hand to life and it also looks better than Thing from "The Addams Family" actually. Quite amazing considering that this movie is over 50 years older.The movie remains definitely best watchable for the fans of '40's horror, everybody else shall probably find too little to enjoy in this too slow moving and too weakly told movie.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another evil hand film starring Peter Lorre!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A nasty old man, Francis Ingram dies. When it comes time to read his will, the two remaining family members arrive and automatically assume that the man's fortune is now theirs. They are a nasty pair and they're in for a nasty surprise when the will is read, as the fortune is left instead to his nurse. The pair plan on using a crooked attorney to contest the will but soon after they make this plan, folks start dying--and it looks as if the dead man, or perhaps the dead man's hand is doing the killing! I never watched this film until recently because I thought I'd already seen it. After all, Peter Lorre is in this film and "Mad Love"--and both films are about possessed hands that kill! Fortunately, the two movies sound very similar but are different enough that it's worth seeing both. However, unlike "Mad Love", "The Beast With Five Fingers" suffers late in the film because the ending goes on a bit long AND is a bit dumb. After all, when the identity of the killer is known, the person who realizes it TELLS the killer and then admits that they haven't told anyone!! Duh! Despite this, the effect of the crawling hand is cool and the film engaging.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The hand itself is great, and the scenes of it running wild and free in the house are some of the best moments in classic horror. This does not however alter the fact that every second of this film in which the hand is offscreen is a painful, tiresome, dreary waste of time. If Robert Florey and Peter Lorre had been allowed to bag Curt Siodmak's dreadful script and use their own, as they unsuccessfully begged Warner Bros. to let them do, what might have been! As it is, one wishes Robert Alda, Andrea King, and the rest of the maddening crew would just follow Victor Francen's lead and die already, so we could just enjoy Peter Lorre cavorting with his wonderful pet hand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie rips off Michael Caine's THE HAND</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's apparent that the producers of BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS went forward in time, stole the idea from THE HAND, then went back in time and made their rip-off. This is dirty pools, I tells ya.I believe copyright laws under current consideration might discourage this form of super-scientific plagiarism.There aren't enough lines in my post to render it eligible to appear on IMDb, so I'm not sure what to do next. There must be something to add to my above sentiments. Give me time and I'll think of something. Anything.Crap!I'm paying the price for concise expression! Tain't fair. Heh. Let's all go to the Taint Fair and see the latest hand-crafted taints.</fullReview>
