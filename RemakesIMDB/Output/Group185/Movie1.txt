		<shortDescription>Decent enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if I was in a rare forgiving frame of mind but The Hand actually worked for me.It doesn't go very deep in the psychological department and just about every average viewer can spot the twist but then the end just throws everything out the window and leaves the audience shouting; What the ****! But it's well acted, especially by Caine who completely earns viewer's sympathy. Writer/director Oliver Stone effortlessly builds up suspense and atmosphere and some scenes here do work really well. Technical aspects are surprisingly well handled and make up effects are gruesome and well done.While The Hand won't go down as a cinematic masterpiece, it's a solid thriller nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not all THAT bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oliver Stone and Michael Caine may well feel a little embarrassed by this tale of a cartoonist haunted by his own severed drawing hand, but despite it's ludicrous premise and rather rubbery effects from Stan Winston, the film isn't all THAT bad.Michael Caine brings an amiable nonchalance to the E.C. horror comic style proceedings while portraying his character's ever growing bitterness perfectly. While the story provides little in surprises the film does work on more than one level, leaving the viewer wondering if what's going on, is all in mind of Caine's character or that it is indeed actually happening. And for a film like this that makes you think, or more fittingly, makes you stop thinking how all very silly this all is, is no mean feat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stone tries his 'hand' at horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An early Oliver Stone directed film. The Hand does well with atmospheric settings, an essential part of any horror story. There's the beautiful country lakeside home, a New York loft and a rain drenched Northern California town.The horror level won't blow you out of the room however. It's more of a story of dark, suspicious moods and egos presented with intelligent scripted dialogue by a first rate cast. Mara Hobel, playing the young daughter, even does well with little furtive glances, dead pan stares and pert smiles.A master touch is the final scene between a thoroughly exhausted and shattered Caine and the Viveca Lindfors 'there are no such things as ghosts' psychiatrist. The final freeze frame of Caine rising up with a look of gloating madness is brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good performance of Michael Caine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cartoonist of comics "Jonathan Lansdale" (Michael Caine) loses a hand in an unfortunate accident that ends with his career and creates a strong tension in their marriage. As a harrowing nightmare, the hand lost appears, committing atrocious murders.It's the first commercial launch of high budget of Oliver Stone, which was not well received by the criticism at the time. It's a movie surprising and very intriguing whose value more remarkable is the ambiguity that its director Oliver Stone poses in this psychological thriller based on the novel by Mark Brandel "The tail of the lizard".Stone shows us a dense atmosphere and surreal, where the subjectivity seizes the story. There are times when the film that we question whether what we recount and we see is really the case or any other remedy used to deceive and confuse the viewer. Through the film and gradual manner the story is complicating and becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish reality from fantasy, where the film has a turbid, dark, surreal, disturbing atmosphere.Very good performance of Michael Caine, with a good management of the camera, and a pleasant and tense music of James Horner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the ending that makes this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching this movie soon after it came out and the special effects were not bad for the time period that it came out despite what people say. Remember, Star Wars had only been out a few years by this time. As far as the movie goes, Caine does quite well with his part and the plot is believable in the way Freddie Kruger is believable. If you've seen many "creature" movies, then this one could seem to be predictable and thus lose some of it's "boo" effect. Wait until the end and watch closely. If you've seen this movie you should know what I mean, if not then pay close attention. After seeing that final scene you suddenly realize that maybe all wasn't as it seemed. Go back through this movie and keep in mind that last scene. Suddenly the whole movie transcends the Freddie Kruger believable and becomes in fact quite plausible. It's like watching Star Wars Episode 4 after just watching Episode 3, it all takes on new meaning!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great blast to watch in this millennium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a lot of people feel this, but the way films are made have changed since the beginning of the millennium. From blocking, cinematography, film stock, writing, pacing, everything is different. So it's really refreshing to watch michael caine do his thing in this oliver stone horrorfest. What might have been over the top campy shtick in the 80s becomes infinitely watchable.I agree about the similarities to the shining but doesn't quite match up. The comments about the burning car i don't agree with. It's inserted to show michael caine getting unhinged the more he suspects he's got a pet killer hand out there.A great movie to check out. Really fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Liked the psychological demons of Michael Caine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a psychological thriller this actually works. In large part because of Michael Caine. As a B movie about a killer hand or a schizo cartoonist it features Olive Stone's tortured man, driven to ruin by a woman, whose lack of self-knowledge and unchecked rage propel him to violence. I kind of agree with another reviewer's disappointment at the ending not wrapping it up, but The Hand is enough of a thing that I feel neither way about the end. Stone's vitriol for women, a characterization many have stuck on throughout his career, is very apparent here. Caine as Johnathan Lansdale is comfortable in his beautiful country home, crafting a semi-popular syndicated cartoon. But his yogic wife Anne (Andrea Marcovicci) wants to do something with her life and demands a move to NYC. This ends up undoing him, but not before he struggles with having his writing/drawing hand severed. Without saying more, I'd recommend this for Caine's gradual unraveling, an engrossing trip into The Mind and even a good Oliver Stone cameo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an exciting psychological thriller based on the novel by Mark Brandel "The tail of the lizard" , though was consistently underrated by most reviewers . It's a surprising flick and very intriguing whose value more remarkable is the ambiguity that its filmmaker Oliver Stone poses in this . A surreal psycho-horror pastiche in which a famous cartoonist of comics named "Jonathan Lansdale" (Michael Caine) who lives unhappily with his wife (Andrea Marcovicci) loses a hand , being severed in an unfortunate car accident that ends with his career and creates a strong tension in their marriage . Soon after , the hand is on the loose with a mind of its own . As a harrowing nightmare, the lost hand appears seeking out victims , committing atrocious murders with an obsessive revenge.This first important Oliver Stone film contains chills , thrills , suspenseful and is quite entertaining . It's the first commercial outing in medium budget from Oliver Stone, which was not well received by the criticism at the time. . Stone's sophomore directorial shows us a dense , unique , atmospheric and surreal ambient , where the subjectivity seizes the story . There are times when the film that we question whether what we recount and we see is really the case or any other remedy used to deceive and confuse the spectator . Through the film and gradual manner the story is complicating and becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish reality from fantasy . This theme about a hand on the loose with a a mind on its own is already been seen in former films such as The Hands of Orlac (1924 by Rober Wiene , Mad Love (1934) by Karl Freund with Peter Lorre and Hands of Orlac (1960) by Edmond T Greville with Christopher Lee and Mel Ferrer . First rate acting by Michael Caine as Jon Lansdale , a comic book artist who loses his right hand in a car accident , though Michael said in a TV interview that the only reason he did this film was to earn enough to put a down payment on a new garage he was having built .Oliver Stone initially wanted Jon Voight to play the lead role, but was turned down by him ; Christopher Walken and Dustin Hoffman also declined the role . Very good support cast formed by expert secondary actors such as Bruce McGill , Viveca Lindfords , Rosemary Murphy , among others . Furthermore , a cameo by Oliver Stone as Bum . Colorful cinematography with a right management of the camera by Baggot , as the picture packs a turbid, dark, surreal, disturbing atmosphere . Thrilling and tense musical score by the great James Horner .The motion picture was professionally directed by Oliver Stone , though usually panned by mostly critics , nowadays is best considered .Stone returning from the Vietnam war did his first film , it was a student film entitled Last Year in Viet Nam (1971), followed by the gritty horror film Seizure (1974) for which he also wrote the screenplay. The next seven years saw him direct two films: Mad Man of Martinique (1979) and this The Hand (1981) . He also wrote many screenplays for films such as Midnight express (1978), Conan (1982), and Scarface (1983). Stone won his first Oscar for Midnight express (1978), but his fame was just beginning to show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>... on the other hand not bad as an adult drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A part of this movie is pure camp ? a severed hand plays a kind of an avenging angel for its former proprietor. Special effects abound. In my opinion they almost destroy the whole movie, especially the final scene ? they are more silly than scary.Strange as it may sound, there is a serious, well acted and superbly constructed drama behind all this. I suspect Oliver Stone wanted to do something in the vein of Kubrick's Shining here. The story has so many similarities that a mere coincidence can be ruled out. A comic book artist feels a midlife crisis coming on. He becomes estranged from his wife and during a bickering scene while she's driving a car the ? you know what ? event takes place. It is perfectly filmed and the way it comes about is totally plausible. The accident triggers an insane obsession in the main character's life about what is missing ? you feel it but you don't have it - and it goes much further than a severed hand. In my opinion Michael Caine does a superb job here playing the disillusioned artist. Andrea Marcovicci is also very good as the wife who is a ?woman with principles" and wants to ?find herself" ? it's stereotype, but high quality stereotype.The best and really memorable scene of the movie takes place in a class room in the attic of a college deep in the sticks. The Caine character accepted a teaching post there after the accident. The camera takes a glance of the assembled students. They look extremely dumb and devoid of any interest. Caine asks them who is their favorite comic book character. You, Billy? Billy starts thinking hard. After several, very long seconds he answers ?I dunno". Caine asks a few other students but does not get better results. The scene creates a perfect atmosphere of disillusionment and doom. A girl at least makes eye contact, and she's not even bad looking. She later looks the Caine character up for some joyless sex, and the bottomless sadness that girl displays throughout is simply heart wrenching and epitomizes the dead end aspect of life one would rather like to forget. Good performance by Annie McEnroe, the girl. Whatever happened to her? I saw her in Stirba-Werewolf Bitch, but, well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The comic book writer and cartoonist Jonathan "Jon" Lansdale (Michael Caine) is the creator of the successful hero "Mandro" and lives with his wife Anne Lansdale (Andrea Marcovicci) and their daughter Lizzie in the countryside. Anne wants to move to New York and has an argument with Jon while driving on the road. She distracts with an impatient driver and has a car accident with a truck where Jon loses his right hand. The hand is not found and Jon needs to use prosthesis. They move to New York and his editor Karen Wagner (Rosemary Murphy) offers another cartoonist to proceed with "Mandro". However Jon is not happy with the modifications introduced in his character by the new cartoonist and Karen let him go.Without money, Jon moves to California to teach in a college while Anne and Lizzie stay in New York for a few more months. Jon has a love affair with his student Stella Roche (Annie McEnroe) and he feels attracted by her. However when his colleague Brian Ferguson (Bruce McGill) tells that Stella is an easy woman, Jon does not want to see her. However, his severed hand kills Stella and when Brian tells that he is going to the police to report that Stella is missing, his hand also kills him. Meanwhile Anne and Lizzie come to his house to spend Christmas with him. Soon he learns that Anne is betraying him and that she intends to go to Los Angeles with Lizzie. Out of the blue, his hand tries to strangle Anne and Jon follows it. Is it possible that the hand does exist to kill whoever anger him?"The Hand" is an early film directed by Oliver Stone with a creepy story. The plot is developed in slow pace and the mystery remains until the last scene when the viewer finally understands what happened. Michael Caine has a great performance as usual and the movie is intriguing and engaging. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "A M?o" ("The Hand")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE HAND (Oliver Stone, 1981) **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nobody can ever accuse Michael Caine of not having had a fascinating career. His incredibly prolific filmography (132 appearances and counting in just over 50 years) is littered with high highs (a handful of all-time classics and 2 Academy Awards) and low lows (actually, from quite early on in his career to, unsurprisingly, the present day). Still, the latter bunch are, for all their glaring faults, hardly unwatchable and, at times, fairly tolerable and this rare horror item is certainly among his more interesting failures.Apart from its horror elements and the chance to watch another Michael Caine stinker (although, as it turns out, Jon Voight and Christopher Walken had both previously turned down the lead role), the film's main draw nowadays is watching an early (though not the first) directorial stint from Oliver Stone (he even has an amusing unbilled cameo as an ill-fated tramp) and, most intriguingly, within an exploitation genre from which he has distanced himself completely since then. As I mentioned earlier, the film ends up being less the disastrous embarrassment I had anticipated and more a watchable (if hardly original) horror flick which moves rather slowly but has has the occasional effective shock moment to satiate genre fans. In fact, Stone infuses the film with a modicum of style including subjective shots from the marauding hand's point of view, delirious dream sequences often shot in monochrome and, most incredibly, an utterly grisly freak car accident sequence (with fake blood galore) early on in the film in which cartoonist Caine loses his drawing hand and which sets the narrative in motion.The thing is that, while it starts well enough, the film is soon bogged down by repetitive marital squabbles between an increasingly unhinged Caine and his free-spirited wife Andrea Marcovicci. Besides, Caine's stump is not exactly the greatest and, when all is said and done, we have been here once too often and I only need to point out the other more notable cinematic examples of "the walking hand" - THE HANDS OF ORLAC (1924), MAD LOVE (1935) THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS (1946), THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962), DR. TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS (1965) and ...AND NOW THE SCREAMING STARTS! (1973) - for this film's relative redundance to become apparent. Still, that such an old-fashioned concept was revived at this point in time and by these film-makers is extraordinary in itself but, even if they did try to bring it up-to-date with the addition of gore and sleaze, I can't say I was too surprised by the twist ending which - while not making a great deal of sense and somewhat dispelling the strong similarities with Michael Caine's previous role in another imitative (but much more successful) slasher, DRESSED TO KILL (1980), which had previously been to the fore - provided Hollywood veteran Viveca Lindfors with a very brief but notable cameo as Caine's no-nonsense shrink.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The subconscious is capable of anything".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Easily influenced by "The Beast with Five Fingers", film-maker Oliver Stone makes his major film debut tackling early 80s horror pulp starring Michael Caine as a comic book illustrator who loses his hand in a freak car accident (that sequence is torturous to watch) and then suddenly he starts to have tormenting visions of his missing hand coming to life committing murders. Making things worse, is the rocky relationship with his wife and his daughter being caught up in the middle of it. A drearily intense psychological shocker, which bestows a strong tailored performance by a professional Caine, but there's also good support offered by Andrea Marcovicci, Bruce McGill, Annie McEnroe, Rosemary Murphy and minor turn by Tracy Walter. The force-fed script plays around with the idea of our central character, is he losing his marbles due to the stress of the ordeal and what's going on around him (family issues) or is his decapitated hand moving around on its own knocking off people. I don't think the mystery is hard to guess, but still Stone's direction is ably pulled off in creating an unsettling nightmare with a convincingly edgy Caine to sell it. It's done in a serious tone, which this type of story has been recycled many times before and even mocked. But it works here. There's one interesting technique, where Stone's changes the screen to a washed out black and white when the hand attacks its like reality is becoming a comic world. Maybe this is a clue, especially when blackouts are mentioned? Also the sound FX, along with James Horner's music score are simply unnerving and dread induced complementing the paranoid state growing. The camera work is beautifully implemented and there are numerous POV shots of the hand at work. Kind of liked the horrific closing too, which throws a spanner into the mix although could have been easily discarded. "The Hand" was a lot better than I expected."I don't think it was really alive".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disembodied hand story minus the usual camp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many early films, even from big name directors, are simple concept horror films. From world famous Oliver Stone comes a somewhat familiar disembodiment story where an artist loses a hand, only for the hand to become a literal "manifestation" (get it?) of his psyche--especially his anger. Now, disembodied hands have a history in cinema stretching back to the silent era, but for some reason in the 80s it was a really popular concept--Idle Hands, Evil Dead II... What's interesting about Stone's take is that it's played with a straight face and a minimum of camp.Partly that has to do with Michael Caine. Caine is always good, and here he's downright sadistic as a grumbling, postal frustrated artist. Another element is the script. Based on a story by Marc Brandel, "The Hand" has more to do with a floundering marriage and unstable future than it does with cheap shocks and startles (though we are speaking Oliver Stone here, so there is more than enough blood). Thirdly, there's Stone's directing itself, which delights in unsettling camera play and some really impressive lighting. Though this is not Stone's first movie, for an early one it is still a very impressive indication of his skill behind the camera, his ability to direct actors, and his visual acumen.For someone looking for scare-a-minute thrills, the plodding length and necessary character development will get in the way, but for those who like their psychological thrillers slowly bubbling up from the bottom, The Hand is very well-paced fare. It all becomes worth it as Caine's psyche breaks down and even he loses track of what he's responsible for.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hand starts in sunny Vermont where Mandro comic book artist John Lansdale (Michael Caine) lives with his wife Anne (Andrea Marcovicci) &amp; young daughter Lizzy (Mara Hobel), while driving along arguing about moving to New York for the winter John's right hand is severed in a freak car accident. John's hand is never found &amp; he has to learn to cope with a prosthetic hand from now on, the accident has a big effect on John's life as he can't draw anymore &amp; has to accept a lowly teaching job in a small town called Sarahville in California which means he has to separate from Anne who then has an affair while John is away. As things go from bad to worse John gets the feeling that his severed right hand has a mind of it's own &amp; is single-handedly (ha!)killing people around him who have angered him...Written &amp; directed by Oliver Stone this psychological horror thriller with a touch of drama has a pretty bad reputation but I have to say I quite liked it, it's certainly not a film that will appeal to a general audience but I think there's enough here to keep one interested throughout it's 100 odd minute duration. The script was based on a novel called 'The Lizard's Tail' by Marc Brandell &amp; centers a tale of psychological drama about a man losing his sanity &amp; failing to adjust after a life changing accident around the old horror cliché of the living disembodied hand used to good effect (or not depending on your opinion) in such films as The Beast with Five Fingers (1947), The Crawling Hand (1963) &amp; Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1964) amongst other's &amp; I thought the concept, plot &amp; way the story progresses was pretty good. The character's are good &amp; I was interested in them, it's nice to see proper people in a horror film rather than faceless teenagers &amp; while the pace isn't the quickest it develops it's story to the point where the events actually matter &amp; have some significance to the audience. I also liked the way Stone gives the film a certain ambiguity &amp; mystery, it's not clear until the end whether John's severed hand is responsible or whether it's John himself committing the murders during his blackouts. Having said that The Hand is not perfect, it's undeniably silly, who did that car belong to that rolled down the diff on fire &amp; why was that scene even in the film in the first place &amp; I really thought the ending was poor too.The film has a nice clean look about it, it looks a bit dated with a very static camera but it's well made. There's not much gore here but there is one half decent money shot here as John gets his hand severed &amp; we see his bloody stump spurting blood everywhere. The severed hand effects are variable &amp; to be honest not that good although I suspect they look better than any modern equivalent CGI effects would. While not overly scary the film does have a few creepy moments here &amp; there &amp; at least it does try to create a bit of an atmosphere although the bizarre scene when a cat decides to literally jump through a window for no apparent reason is unintentionally funny. There's some nudity as well if that sort of thing interests you as the local slut gets her breast's out within five minutes of meeting Caine, I wish I had that effect on women...Filmed in California The Hand has good production values &amp; looks nice enough. The acting is pretty good even if Michael Caine goes a little over the top at times, apparently he took the role after Jon Voight, Christopher Walken &amp; Dustin Hoffman turned the part down &amp; Caine has also said in interviews the only reason he made The Hand was to earn the money to pay for a new garage he was having built at the time! Fair enough I suppose but was rolling around on the floor fighting your own severed hand really worth it?The Hand is a film that I feel like I shouldn't have liked but I did like it &amp; even if I would find it hard to recommend it to one &amp; all I think anyone interested in psychological horror could do a lot worse &amp; watching Michael Caine overact as he wrestles with his own severed hand (&amp; lose) is fun too. If nothing else The Hand teaches us one very important thing, never put your hand out of a car window while your wife is driving otherwise it'll end in tears...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie twice recently, and thought that it was excellent. Great, in fact.This early Oliver Stone film is quite good in that you really have to be "sharp" to "get it". Although on the surface, this movie seems to be almost a 'slasher' movie, it is not. It is much, much more. Might be a little too heady for some to grasp, but that makes it no less great.I think the performance by Mr. Caine was superb. I could really feel his emotions at times. He certainly reached way inside of himself in this role. In my opinion, the best performance I have seen by him.This is definitely one of those 'more than meets the eye' type of movies. If you watch it, and don't get it, watch it again.I would recommend this film to fans of Psychological Thrillers, Horror, Mystery, Crime Drama, and cult film fans.I can't believe this has a cumulative rating of only 4.7. I give 'The Hand' 8 out of 10. A GREAT Horror Psychological Thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oliver Stone's second movie was this classy, big-studio, high-budget horror movie which has a memorable, extremely well-done "freak accident" scene and great special effects by Carlo Rambaldi, but plods along too slowly, especially considering that the central big "twist" becomes obvious quickly (if you think you've guessed what's happening right from the first murder....you're probably right). Michael Caine (who claims he did this movie only to pay for his new garage!) has some intense acting moments, but at other times he seems to be trying to stifle his laughter at his own dialogue! Nevertheless, this would make a compatible double bill with his other bizarre shocker from the early 1980s, "The Island". ** out of 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Caine is Superb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A towering, powerhouse performance by Michael Caine brings life to Oliver Stone's horrifically bad film, The Hand. Caine receives an unreserved and enthusiastic ten stars while the film itself is a one star bomb. Caine brings a gravitas to the movie that overwhelms the ludicrousness of it all and his is a performance that clearly depicts his stunning gifts and ability to bring depth and meaning to any project and role. He only surpasses his work here in The Island, one of the very worst films ever made and still one worth watching for Caine's magnificent skill at raising the worst directors' work to a level of some acceptability, if not art (recalling The Island is painful and was one of the worst cinema experiences of my life although Caine gave it all he had.) The Hand is just terrible and the story and direction both fail miserably. From start to finish, one wonders how anyone could believe this would make a fine film. The sole redeeming feature of the motion picture fiasco known as The Hand is that Michael Caine is such a truly superb actor that he single handedly pulls this stinking mess from the sewer of bungled films and brilliantly distracts viewers with his excellent work so they are not completely embarrassed to find themselves watching total trash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good For Oliver Stone Fans and Horror Movie Admirers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are interested in Stone's cinematic evolution or you like to spend time watching horror movies, this one is watchable. Using a part of body as an horror object might be an original idea at that time. Yet, I don't recommend the movie to those who prefer more realistic psychological thrillers because the script becomes more and more supernatural while watching the film and psychological explanations for actions of the hand and its owner are rather weak. I think the final 10 or 15 minutes of the film surprised many watchers at that time, but for today's horror movie admirers, it can be dull. The dialogs between Jonathan Lansdale and Bruce McGill are worth listening. I like Stone's camera angles serving to show the scene to us from the point of view of the hand, especially the one from within the grass. In addition, two women characters of the film, Stella Roche and Anne Lansdale, are powerful, independent, beautiful and interesting. I appreciate it.</fullReview>

It is really futile to discuss if the hand is "real" because it is not possible obviously for a severed hand to act like that. Having understood that one should think of the psychological aspects of the movie. I think this is a great horror movie but the description of paranoia and delusions is quite weak since we never really get a feeling that Lansdale is suffering very much whereas such mental stated would be extremely unpleasant and not funny. The plot is also extremely predictable whereas an ec horror or twilight zone would have a good twist this movie is really too long and predictable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delicious idea, with efficient horror, gore and character psychosis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oliver Stone's second feature film, The Hand is an effective horror yarn based on a novel by Marc Brandell. In an early scene the psychological themes that weave through this narrative are highlighted. Jonathan Lansdale's (Michael Caine) daughter, Lizzie (Mara Hobel), pokes the tail of a lizard, as her stick gets closer, the tail writhes. She questions her fathers explanation that it is reflex, as it stops once danger (the stick) is moved away. The original title of the novel was 'The Lizard's Tail', and it is this that sets up the idea of amputee psychological connections; an exploration of ideas perpetuated, and fetishised by the real-life condition experienced by amputees, phantom limb syndrome. (This is a condition where the sensation of - in this example - hand and fingers, can still be felt, despite the limbs absence.)Caine is a comic book artist, and in a freak car accident, he loses his right hand. After a search the hand is never discovered. With his career over, he moves away from New York to teach, his wife Anne (Andrea Marcovicci), and daughter stay behind. As Jon embarks on a sexual affair with one of his students, Stella (Annie McEnroe), and as Jon's angers erupt, it seems that his hand carries out revenge. The most effective scene in the film, one that is clearly, and brilliantly directed, acted and lit, is in Jon's cabin garage, police stand around sweating. They report a funny smell, and Jon is quizzed as to what is in the truck of his car. It's a thoroughly atmospheric sequence.The plot is, of course, completely silly, but it actually works quite well. It does have moments of great mood, helped by James Horner's score, and the visual effects by Carlo Rambaldi - the severed hand mostly effective, as "good-FX-their-the-time. This extension of the phantom limb syndrome is a delicious little idea, and perfectly fits within the context of many horror films of the time. It has elements of Stephen King, James Herbert, and certainly takes influence from the famous EC comics of the 1950's, and this modern mixture of efficient horror, gore, and a little splash of Jungian psychoanalytical character psychosis.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, I'm not talking about Caine. Sure, he was fine. He has an accent, so that's always good. "The Hand" was alright; but as far as knock-out performers, there was only one. The therapist, played by the little known (but widely praised) John Stinson. My vote is for Stinson. It upsets me that his last gift to the artistic arena was in about '90. Someone should have grasped onto this man in Tinsel Town and plastered him everywhere. We have people like Tom Selleck making 7 figures and Stinson is probably eating his dinner from a dirty paper bag. It's pathetic, people. I've looked into it and he is apparently starting up a new production company out in the midwest (of all places, Nebraska) called buzzyproductions. I guess I know where I'm hitching my caravan to experience the American avante garde. Get with the program Hollywood, you're letting them go left and right here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comic book artist Jonathan Lansdale(Michael Caine)loses his good hand in a freak car accident. His marriage to Anne(Andrea Marcovicci)had already begun to crumble and even suffers worse because JL even becomes are harder person to be around than before. She has hinted at them separating while she takes their daughter Lizzie(Mara Hobel)to school in New York, but when his professional career hits the skids, a California teaching job becomes available. The job itself is nothing to write home about but an affair with a student, Stella(Annie McEnroe), offers a promise of happiness as Anne becomes involved with another man much more attentive to her emotional needs(..and it does help that this man is kind to her treating her with respect which seems to be faults JL lacks). But, JL is not the kind of person to give up his family because his pride is a monster to deal with and his very thought of that man fulfilling his role as father enrages him. That's where the horror elements come into play. Those who cross JL's ire are being attacked and killed by his severed hand! That hand seems to have such power in it that it crushes bones and throats with gusto. Director Oliver Stone, though, often provides doubt regarding whether it's really that hand or JL himself as we see his face twist in bitter anger as if he's on the verge of unleashing furious violence. Caine does this well, but unfortunately his cartoonist can often be so vile and harshly aggressive and taken to outbursts towards Anne, that we feel nothing for him at all when his life becomes threatened itself. I certainly don't blame Anne for wanting to leave him and seeing his life fall apart isn't that shocking. It's hard to feel any sort of sympathy for his plight because we rarely have a chance to like him. Stella is able to get through to his calmer side which seems to soften him until we find out a secret regarding her and another teacher(Bruce McGill)she's involved with sexually. Decent horror fare, with a nasty little bloody sequence where JL loses his hand with blood squirting all over the place. Stone creates enough a mystery keeping us from totally believing this hand is doing the offing. It has an end result regarding JL when that hand has one last task, silencing Anne(not that surprising, huh?)which might provide enough answers to satisfy, yet Stone doesn't release us, but instead drags it out further. That last five minutes, I believe, could've been left out and it wouldn't have hurt the film. Stone, it seems, wants one last grisly scene to close his film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, the murders weren't gory (Just strangling), it was slow at sometimes, but still an enjoyable movie. I mean, Idle Hands was gory, funnier, fast-moving, has a great soundtrack, and better, but it's still a great flick.The story is about a cartoonist played by Michael Caine who shows his girl a lizard's tail (The name of the story the movie is based on) which is still moving which fore-shadows what happens later in the movie. Then in an automobile accident, he loses his hand. They can't find it, so they give him a robot hand for a replacement. And the hand he lost was the hand he draws and writes with, so they have to have a replacement. He complains the artist is not as good as him and they find a recent cartoon scribbled on. And then there's the murders. A bum (played by director Oliver Stone) is killed by the hand (In a brilliant black and white sequence). Then Caine moves to some place to teach and cheats on another girl. Then other murders happen.I won't give away what else happens. If you want a psychological thriller about a killing hand, rent this (Or And Now the Screaming Starts). But if you want a killer hand and a comedy, see Idle Hands (Don't listen to critics).The Hand: B+ Idle Hands: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smartly done psychological horror thriller by Oliver Stone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Successful comic book artist Jon Lansdale (an excellent and credible performance by Michael Caine) loses his right hand in a freak automobile accident. Various people who anger Jon begin to disappear. Is the hand responsible for what's happening? Or is Jon's troubled mind imagining everything? Writer/director Oliver Stone handles the potentially silly and laughable premise with admirable maturity, intelligence, and seriousness: The plot is grounded in a believable everyday reality, cheap shocks and excessive gore gets eschewed in favor of compellingly ambiguous psychological horror, the perspective remains refreshingly dark and adult throughout, and the tense and spooky mood of intriguing mystery keeps the viewer guessing right to the very end. Moreover, the movie often plays more like a bleak domestic drama with horror elements than a straight-up frightfest. The fine acting by the tip-top cast holds the picture together: Caine does sterling work in the lead, with sound support from Andrea Marcovicci as Jon's fed-up New Age wife Anne, Annie McEnroe as smitten college student paramour Stella Roche, Mara Hobel as Jon's sweet daughter Lizzie, Bruce McGill as gregarious redneck college psychology professor Brian Ferguson, Viveca Lindfors as a tough shrink, and Rosemary Murphy as compassionate agent Karen Wagner. The convincing make-up f/x rate as another substantial asset. Both King Baggot's sharp cinematography and James Horner's shivery score are up to speed. A worthwhile shocker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hands Down the Best Killer Hand Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We really have to hand it to Oliver Stone. As far as Killer Hands goes, nobody touches this one. We have to give it a thumbs up, even if some haters of the genre give it the middle finger. This may be a hand-me-down story, but Stone handles it with verve and a handsome style. At the risk of being the sound of one hand clapping, I have say to say that Stone doesn't pull any punches and comes up with a gripping story.Seriously, this is about as good as an above average Stephen King movie. It has an interesting central characters and a nice supporting cast. The direction and action is fine.Note, ten year old Kara Hobel played in "Mommy Dearest" the same year she played in this movie. She was a hell of a brave kid to take on two such scary roles.I would compare this film with Brian DePalma's "Dressed to Kill" which also starred Caine and came out nine months earlier. Both are competent low budget horror films that delivers the chills, but sound ridiculous and dumb when you try to describe the plot afterward.You wouldn't hand out any academy awards for this, but anybody who likes good, solid thrillers shouldn't keep their hands off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cartoonist Joe Landsdale (Michael Caine) is in a troubled marriage with Anne (Andrea Marcovicci). She wants to be on her own with their daughter Lizzie (Mara Hobel). In a freak accident Joe's right hand is severed--but the hand itself seems to disappear. He lives but can't draw anymore and his marriage completely falls apart. His disembodied hand also seems to come to life on its own and kills anyone who Joe gets mad at. But is it is hand...or is Joe going mad? The film has potential with a great cast and a VERY bloody scene at the beginning where Caine losses his hand. Then it just falls to pieces. The script becomes very disjointed and all the characters are extremely unlikable. Landsdale comes across as obnoxious and sarcastic and Anne just stands there and takes it. If you're expecting blood and gore from this, don't bother. Aside from that gory opening no one is killed until OVER an hour in! Also director/writer Oliver Stone's sexism comes roaring through--especially in the character of Stella (Annie McEnroe) who is treated horribly. Also bad dialogue doesn't help. Good performances by Caine, Marcovicci and Viveca Lindfors (briefly at the end) can't save this one. It's unpleasant, depressing and full of characters you couldn't care less about. The 6 is for the acting and gore scenes alone. Also Caine mentioned in his autobiography he hated this film. That should tell you all you need to know. Oliver Stone appears as a bum that the hand kills. Too bad it didn't get him before he made this movie!</fullReview>

Or is he hallucinating? Or is he committing the murders himself during apparent blackouts?The problem is, I didn't care. The movie isn't compelling despite a few effective moments here and there, the highlight being the scene in which Caine's hand is lopped off by a passing truck. The first hour or so is effective but the longer the movie goes on the more garbled it becomes. If we're comparing, I prefer 'The Beast With Five Fingers'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Hand" with a mind of its own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers) The movie "The Hand" starts off with national syndicated cartoonist Jon Lansdale, Michael Caine, losing his right hand in a car accident that put an end of his career but also sent Jon into a tailspin with his mind snapping well before the film was over. It's hard to grasp just what was happening to Jon and his severed hand since were given a number of clues by the movies director Oliver Stone, who plays a bum and one of the Hands victims, that the Hand is nothing more then a figment of the neurotic Jon Lansdales imagination, or is it!Jon trying to get used to a mechanical right hand finds that he's somehow under the control of his severed hand that has some connection to the rest of his body. Crawling down the highways and byways, and dodging traffic, all the way from Vermont Jon's Hand reaches the New York City limits were Jon together with his wife Ann,Andera Marcovicci, and his ten year old daughter Lizzie, Mara Hobel,are living. Jon upset over the way his cartoon character Mandro is being rewritten by this former underground hot shot cartoonist David Madden, Charles Fleischer, who's been hired by his boss the head of the newspapers art's and craft's department Karen Wagner,Rosemary Murphy, to take his place. Madden turns the macho and fearless Mandro into a self doubting and whimpering jerk that Jon, in disgust, finally decides to quite his job and goes to Saraville California getting a job as a professor teaching the art of cartoon drawing at the local university.At the university Jon becomes infatuated with one of his students Stella Roche, Anne McEnroe, who's also involved with another teacher at the collage; God's gift, in his deluded mind, to the women of America Brian Ferguson, Bruce McGill. While Jon is trying to overcome the scars of his car accident his severed right hand is making its way wester-ward from New York to get in touch with the rest of its body. At the same time the hand goes on killing anyone who stands in its way in attempting to keep it from attaching itself to whom it so rightfully belongs to: Jon's body. The hand slowly starts losing control and later attacks even Jon's wife Ann who got the Hand, and Jon, very angry. Ann has been cheating on Jon with her young and handsome yogi exercise instructor the very flexible Bill Richman, Nicholas Hormann, who she's been living with. Jon at the same time has been cheating on Ann by having a sexual affair himself, with Stella, in the wilds and backwoods of rural California.The Hand creeping into Jon's life makes things a bit stressful for him by murdering Stella after it found that she was cheating on it, or Jon. Later the hand takes care of, by strangling, Brian when in a drunken and jealous fit over Stella leaving him for Jon threatened to tell the police that Jon was the last person seen with her, Stella was yet to be found murdered, before she disappeared. The Hand now completely out of control attacks Ann almost strangling her until it's chased away by the tearful screams of little Lizzie.Frustrated in not killing Ann it then goes after Jon himself who barley survives it's deadly grip. With the police on the scene it's found that Jon has gone totally nuts and not only murdered a number of people,Stella &amp; Brian, but in a last act of desperation to keep from being put away for good tries to blame his bad, or severed from his body,right hand for all the murderers he committed.***MAJOR SPOILER*** If the movie "The Hand" ended with the deranged Jon taken away by the police and kept from hurting, or murdering, both himself and those around him it would have been a fairly decent horror film. Instead it has inserted into it a mindless ending sequence with Jon being examined by Doctor Viveca Lindfords and then having the creeping and murderous Hand that we were lead to believe was a fraud, on Jon's part, reappear! The hand goes on to do number on Dr. Lindford which, with the possible exception of it being ripped off,was the most grossed-out scene in the movie.The ending looked like it was forced on, or in, to the movie since without it the film "The Hand" would have been just another psycho clone with the Hand, replacing Norman Bates' mother, as Jon's mad and dangerous obsession.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic In It's Own Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a story of a comic book artist who looses his hand in an accident, which costs him his job and in turn helps ruin his marriage while in the meantime "his hand comes back to life and slowly begins to kill those around him who victimize him". Obviously if THAT were true it would be a pretty stupid movie and only good for laughs, and i fear that the reason it has such a low rating is firstly because people were EXPECTING something else from the movie and secondly, possibly they did not understand the point of it.It is a very well crafted and intense psychological study and I can't understand how some say the acting is poor because it is really quite decent. Now of course the idea of a hand roaming around killing people, even if it's a character's psychotic manifestation could be in part an object of humour, which to me does not hurt the movie but only allows it another level. I am always foremost extremely wary of whether a storyline is well crafted and actually makes sense. Oliver stone who brought us another such horror classic as "U Turn" (which if you have seen is full of intentional black humour)develops the story expertly well, and in terms of story credibility, where he did go a bit too far in "U Turn", he keeps this one well under control and the ending fits perfectly.I would even consider this movie up there with classics such as "Psycho" because honestly.... If you can accept the fact that a character is psychologically deranged and has a multiple personality disorder which makes him dress up as his mother and imagining that it is his mother who kills people, BUT he is still able to control this alter ego when it suits him and keep a sane and normal appearance to any passers by, then you should be able to accept a character who blacks out and imagines that his severed hand is killing the aggressors around him when he himself is in fact doing it. To sum it up, if you're into psychological thrillers, check it out. it might not be exactly what you expect but that itself doesn't make it a bad movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>as a fan of Caine's and a (usually) fan of Stone's it's suffice to say this is crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hand is a psychological horror film, at least that's what it touts itself to be on the video box. It's mostly just a lot of heavy-handed pseudo-thrills meant to give chills and shocks when really it just creates some redundancy. We're given the tragedy of a character, Joe Lansdale, who loses his hand in a rather freak accident while his wife is driving the car, and he can't seem to find the bloody thing in a field. He gets a metal replacement put on ala the Terminator, but does the old hand left for the bugs in the field have its own mind? Or is Joe just controlling the thing and going after all of the people he's close to (i.e. his own wife, his mistress, his mistress's actual guy on the side, etc)? The real intentions aren't made totally clear, this despite Oliver Stone's attempts at creating a sense of danger and paranoid with Caine's character. And Michael Caine, he does try his best, he really does, going for every scene with the kind of dedication and (trying to search for) truth of the matter even as the script tries to undercut him with below-par dialog. Maybe Stone wasn't really equipped for this material anyway, that in his defense (if possible) he was a hired gun- based more possibly on his first film Seizure, a horror film, than any clout he got from his first Oscar- and whatever skills he brought weren't put into a style that really made things work.Indeed, now that we have a movie like Raimi's Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn, we see how cheesy a killer-hand flick really is and how it would be simply better off as unintentional comedy. There's a couple of scenes were we see the potential for something over the top, like when the black cat jumps up on the desk and inexplicably crashes through the window (!) or just the image of that lizard's tale flapping about which the original book from the movie has its name. But none of the characters are convincing, and the tendencies that are weakest that Stone tends towards which are, frankly, beating-you-over-the-head things with direction and writing, are put way up front here. It's been said, by the man himself, that Stone was on coke for a period in the early 80s prior to writing Scarface. Maybe some of that rubbed off the wrong way here? Bottom line: whatever's meant to be scary is downright lame, and its just crappy film-making that battles with an actor of Caine's caliber who does try and make it interesting. He does, actually, which may be the only real longevity this has. If you're at all a Stone fan, as I am (up to a point) it's a disappointing Psycho variation, and for his haters it's just more fuel for the fire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's Michael!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, you're a highly strung cartoonist (sort of Jack Nicholson's illustrator alter-ego of "The Shining") experiencing marital problems when you lose your drawing hand in a freak road accident. From there, your life spirals out of control, as your former appendage takes on an existence of its own, prowling the country-side, defacing your artwork and strangling your bedfellows. You'd go mad - who wouldn't? Michael Caine certainly did, but it's whether his altered state occurred before or after he agreed to make this picture, that is really in question. Sure, it's dark, haunting, there's a grim atmosphere and some gruesome violence, but it never manages to escape the absurd premise.Caine is at his unhinged best, while Marcovicci as his Shelley Duvall, takes flight into the arms of a co-worker, as his odd behaviour turns strangely obsessive. He seems to maintain a psycho-somatic link to his phantom grip, but is he really able to control its actions? That's the sixty-four dollar question that we never really learn, although there's more than a hundred minutes in which to watch it all unravel - the movie that is (it only takes Caine one scene to reach maximum lunacy).Capable supporting cast (McEnroe, McGill, Corley, Lindfors and Murphy) restore some mental equilibrium and the music and cinematography also help create a sense of psychological nightmare in spite of the credibility weaknesses. Had director Stone not been so explicit and only 'played his hand' (so to speak) by implication, this could almost have succeeded. But just when the cast and dialogue seem to have achieved maturity, out pops the crawling, decomposing throwback to the Addams family, with its vice-like mind grip on Caine's cognisance, and an equally taut clasp around a victim's throat. Sordid revision of "The Beast With Five Fingers" is testament only to the longevity of Caine's career, in spite of the plethora of abominable pictures he made in the eighties, of which "The Hand" is exhibit A.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not that the endings are much of a surprise, it is just the movie sets up one thing only to tear it down in the end, and then it tears down what just happened and sets up what the movie was trying to establish in the first place. I know that doesn't make sense, but if you saw it you may get what I am trying to say. This movie stars Michael Caine as a comic book artist. He ends up getting into a wreck, well actually he and his wife just avoid a wreck, but he gets his hand chopped off. He goes through some depression because his hand is not found and can't be reattached. He ends up getting an artificial hand which lets him to some things, but not things that take a little touch (like draw the comic he does). He tries teaching a class, but he is still depressed about losing his hand and not being able to draw. Meanwhile, his lost hand has seemingly come to have a life of its own, and for some reason it wants to kill. Could have been a good movie, but they turn stuff around here and there to try and surprise the audience and it ends up really deflating the whole movie.</fullReview>

It was creepy and violent, but just didn't grab me. :-) I remember Viveca Lindfors from Stargate. She was interesting as the psychiatrist, but that was five minutes. Andrea Marcovicci, who played Caine's wife was just flat. Nothing there.The only thing that was really interesting was the action with Annie McEnroe.

		<shortDescription>"It's Not a Bad Movie" (Oh Yes, It Is!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember in 1981, as a young lad, watching SCTV on Friday nights. One Friday evening Dave Thomas was dressed as Michael Caine in a skit from this movie The Hand. He was being interviewed and kept saying in a pretty good characterization of Michael Caine and his cockney accent, "It's not a bad movie." Well, it is a bad movie. It is not the worst one ever made or even close to that level of ineptitude, but it is a confusing horror film with no direction. It lacks heart. It lacks coherence, good transitions, and a reasonable plot. The Hand tells the story of a comic strip artist losing his hand in a freak car accident. Eventually he sees(or dreams...after I saw the film I still didn't know)his lost appendage commit terrible murders and even try to strangle himself(that's right...you heard me...strangle himself...Hmmmm). The viewer is never really sure of what we are seeing as being Caine's actions, the hand's actions, or Caine's imagination(or maybe the hand's imagination....I understand it comes in quite HANDy). The script was the product of writer-director Oliver Stone in his second major film. Stone definitely shows far more promise as a director rather than a screenwriter(he has a bit acting part as a bum which is better than script too). Caine is Caine...a likable kind of guy who is prone to get hysterical one moment and quiet another moment. Stone shows his future directorial flair for some scenes of suspense and character building, but also fails miserably with some longer scenes of action and innovative, uninteresting shots. Some of the scenes are downright ridiculous as when Caine loses his hand against a truck. I laughed myself silly watching his over-acting and Stone's embellishment of bleeding. A very poorly shot scene. The film, despite being generally poorly made, isn't as bad as many have made it to be. But make no mistake...it is a bad picture!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When "The Hand" first came out, most people probably hadn't heard of Oliver Stone. Now, knowing that he went on to helm "Salvador", "Platoon", "Wall Street", "Talk Radio", "Born on the Fourth of July", "The Doors", "JFK", "Heaven and Earth", "Natural Born Killers", "Nixon", "U Turn", "Any Given Sunday" and, sadly, "Alexander", it's hard for us to believe that he started out with a movie about a severed hand that won't stay dead. Michael Caine plays Jonathan Lansdale, a cartoonist whose hand gets knocked off in an accident. From there, anyone who wrongs him is asking for trouble. Stone appears as a homeless man who...well, you can probably guess what happens. "The Hand" doesn't have anything that we wouldn't expect from such a movie, but it's worth seeing just as a reference point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror film that tries to be more and fails</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hand is a very poor film. It is not, like some poor films, suffering from inept direction, low budget and untalented actors-instead, what we have here is a very Sidomak "is it supernatural or is it in the protaganist's head?". Unfortunately, this film's poor script, glacier pacing, unlikable characters make the whole Sidomak concept fail. Also, as a movie made in the early 80's, "The Hand" did not have to operate on the sort of restrictions that made Sidomak adopt his "is it or isn't" plots in the first place. Also, this idea was very tired, tv-movie material by the eighties (or by the end of the forties, for that matter). This film suffers, I feel, from similar problems that plague horror films made by "serious" filmmaker's-they just can't accept that they're making a simple genre picture, and instead try to elevate it with a bunch of "psychological" horror. I'm not saying one can't make a meaningful horror film (look no further than Night of the Living Dead for a horror film with a message)but that too often a "serious" filmmaker will f-up a horror flik with his condescending attitude towards the genre. "The Hand" is one example of this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Get back, you silly cow!!!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Caine is absolutely embarrassing in this 1981 bore-fest that tries too hard to pass itself off as legitimate "horror" but comes off as any other number of his misfire films from the 70's and 80's that can be found in a cut-out bin at your local non-chain video store (or nowhere at all).There are only a few moments of unintentional humor, such as the "paper crumpling" sounds that can be heard whenever "the hand" goes for a walk, or the complete inability to act by Andrea Marcovicci who plays his wife. Every scene Marcovicci is in reeks of "D-Grade acting". In fact, I swear half the time she isn't even trying, like she's hamming it up on stage for some ridiculous off-Broadway production that no one bothered to see.Most people who visit this page must already know what "THE HAND" is about. Basically Caine is a comic illustrator/writer who loses his hand in an accident after he sticks it out of a car window while his wife fails to pay attention to the truck in front of them. This was probably the "goriest" scene which involves red blood spraying out of a bloody stump. Don't hold your breath, there aren't any other gory scenes following this one.So Caine revisits the accident site trying to find his missing hand and of course, it's gone. Meanwhile, we have a "hand-cam" following a gray hand walking around country-sides and hitching rides(!!), choking people to death, mostly those who have either wronged Caine or upset him. So by now, this would make a great movie to watch while either stoned or in the mood for a comedy, but it provides no entertainment to either party.Most of the actors/characters in this movie are so grating, unsympathetic and obnoxious, you pray that "the hand" is going to get them fast, especially the wife. The "ending" should not have continued to the scene with the psychiatrist as I thought it was nicely wrapped up the way it was first explained. But then again, all lousy horror movies need to end with a scene that leave them open for sequelitis should they become financially successful ("BASKET CASE", here's looking at you!).Caine acts to a level that is unnecessary for the dreck that he is starring in. I've always felt that Caine is a very good actor (it's not common to see Caine deliver a bad acting performance) yet has starred in so many horrible and forgettable movies that it's quite amazing how broad his resume stretches. "THE HAND" is up there with "THE ISLAND", "THE JIGSAW MAN", "ASHANTI" and "PEEPER" as some of the worst movies he's ever starred in.This movie isn't even worth it for a good laugh or two. You'll only get one, and that's when Caine yells "Get back, you silly cow!!!" to the female driver that causes his accident. Trust me, that's not a good thing either!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caine is good, but the film is a bit of a mish-mash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hand is especially interesting on a curiosity level because it is directed by the great Oliver Stone. What was the man behind such masterpieces as Platoon and Born on the Fourth of July doing working on a horror opus like this? Who knows.Michael Caine is pretty good as a cartoonist who loses his hand in a freak car accident. Later, the severed hand comes to life and starts killing all the people who have ever wronged Caine. Or, is it that Caine is killing them himself, but hallucinating that the hand is the culprit?The scene in which Caine loses his hand is remarkable in many ways. The agony etched across his face as he staggers around bleeding is a great moment of acting. The special effects employed to show the hand getting sliced off is convincing and makes you want to turn away from the screen. However, in other aspects the film is a failure. The "twist" ending defies logic and undermines much of the careful explanatory detail that has gone before. The basic premise of a killer hand crawling around is also a bit too funny to take seriously, and anyway, wasn't it used before in The Beast With Five Fingers?This film is a mixed bag of good elements and bad elements. However, fans of Stone and Caine will undoubtedly want to give it a whirl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CREEPY!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Losing a hand in a car accident is one thing anyone will never get over with. Losing your mind is forever! This movie will make anyone's skin crawl.....(DID I SAY CRAWL?) What a knee-slapper, a whack on the back, a slap in the face,... (UH-OH!) WHERE'S MY HAND? (AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!)This horror movie is a combination of creepy, silly, and questionably unbelievable! Michael Caine plays a maimed cartoonist who descends into madness after the loss of hand, and then no one finds the hand afterwards. Somehow, the spirit of his hand remains in his mind, and seemingly drives him into the breaking point. Then in one scene one of his students takes advantage of him, which was no surprise to me. But the true ending of the movie would be a true horror ending when the severed hand really shows and the counselors should be ignored completely. Severed limbs are creepy the earlier ones show be taken advantage of just don't look over your shoulder for a creepy, crawly, hand. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!! 2 OUT OF 5 STARS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps Director's Worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An average horror film that tries to think hard on certain ideas, but fails in giving anything provocative or scary. Has the same types of faults, which plague later Oliver Stone films such as Natural Born Killers(1994), and U-Turn(1997). Michael Caine transcends the story and gives a performance that foreshadows his dark humorous one in A Shock to the System(1990). Its a difficult prospect for a director to balance between the horrific and philosophical, and Stone has some trouble doing this. Stone's films work when the ideas presented are not overburdened with pretension as in some of his films. Oliver Stone would recover from this disaster to make his first masterpiece, Salvador(1984). Recommanded only for hardcore Michael Caine or Oliver Stone fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uninteresting Thriller Has No Bite to It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie as a kid nearly 20 years ago and could only vaguely remember it. Saw it again on cable the other night and the movie was worse than I remember. The premise of the film is fairly ridiculous. The thought of anyone believing that a hand by itself has the ability to kill a number of human beings is too much. Of course, the viewer believes this to be explained by the thought that perhaps it was Caine's character (Jon) who was doing the killing all along...or was he? Does anyone care?The performances are all pretty shallow including Michael Caine. If you are an Oliver Stone fan, then you will be disapointed by this tasteless muck. The truth is that the viewer basically wants the majority of the characters to get wasted since they are all so unlikable. Bland thriller!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An early Oliver Stone - minus the conspiracy nonsense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So was it the hand or was it him? Or better put: was it his old severed hand or his still-attached loyal hand? Or better even: was it his right or his left hand? We are left (pun, oh pun) in the dark about this. Has Caine gone insane or did the hand do the killing? Wow. What a dilemma. Oliver Stone certainly knows how to pose the relevant questions. Was it all a conspiracy by his old hand to screw up its old master? Conspiracy. Sounds familiar. Stone's early effort is bland, unimaginative, badly directed even. Visually it's unsophisticated, and most of the characters are either unrealistic, clichéd or boring. The film isn't boring, but it's not exactly exciting either. If Caine weren't in it I would have most likely not watched it. This killer-hand idea ranks right up (or down) there with the killer lepus, killer shrews, killer bees, and killer rats of the movie world. A very absurd thing in the movie was the fact that they couldn't find his severed hand on the scene of the accident. His wife and a couple of cops were searching for it, yet they couldn't find it. (And we know that the hand didn't scurry away immediately.) Yet when Caine later on visits the site, he actually manages to find his ring; Caine finds his comparatively tiny ring, but a couple of people (professionals) can't find an entire hand. The scene where one of Caine's students very matter-of-factly offers her body to him is a pure male fantasy. Stone is privately a major skirt-chaser, so this scene must have been dear to his heart.An early effort from the Marxist Oliver Stone. Quite a simple movie, before he developed his fetish for complex ? not to mention idiotic ? conspiracy theories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bit Too Dead Pan To Be A Success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comic book artist Jon Lansdale is involved in a car accident where he loses his right hand . Trying to adjust to life without his hand Lansdale becomes more and more obsessed and feels he is descending in to insanity and feels he's being stalked by his severed hand . Is this delusion or has his severed hand taken on a life of its own ? This is an early directorial effort from Oliver Stone . The fact that Stone constantly states that SALVADOR was his directorial debut should tell you something about THE HAND . It should also be pointed out that that Stone's first preference for Lansdale was Jon Voight , then Dustin Hoffman then Christopher Walken then finally Michael Caine who in this part of his career was in total slumming it for the money mode and apparently did the film to pay for his new garage . It's very noticeable in the early part of the film Caine hasn't bothered to learn his lines and is obviously reading from cue cards . Caine's performance does improve later in the film but there's no way it could have got any worse than his early scenes The other flaw with the film is its pompous dead pan tone . This is THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS territory a film that is something of a camp classic and camp is not an adjective you can use to describe THE HAND . It constantly touches upon serious themes such as disability , insanity and marital pressure and these themes contrast badly with a premise that is rather daft and everyone associated with the movie has been better prior and after THE HAND</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drama and horror don't mix.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mix of drama and horror is unusually and unfortunately it doesn't work.Actually I think that the movie would have been quite good if it had just been an horror movie but for some strange reason there is more drama than horror in this movie and the drama elements are far from interesting or original. A shame.Still it is a worthy early effort from the now famous director Oliver Stone. The movie has it's moments and it's nice to see some of the style that Oliver Stone also used in his later better known movies, in a way that makes it a must see for the Oliver Stone fans.Far from good but also far from bad. Only recommendable for the Stone fans.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oliver Stone should keep his HANDS off the horror genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the overenthusiastic movie-junkies who claim that Oliver Stone is a genius and a undeniable master in cinema should watch this early failure and reconsider. Sure, films like Platoon and JFK (which he directed) and titles like Midnight Express and Scarface (which he wrote) speak to the imagination, but this grotesque and rather nasty horror film is completely uninspired and silly. Actually, it's just a plain rip-off from the classic suspense film `The Beast With Five Fingers' starring the legendary Peter Lorre. ***Small Spoilers***Michael Caine plays an entangled cartoonist who loses his hand in an accident. His lost hand comes to life again and seems to start a killing spree?Is that true, or is our cartoonist just hallucinating and suffering from a twisted, murderous pressure himself ?? ***End Spoilers*** The acting performances of the entire cast are far below standards, especially Annie McEnroe?I don't know where Stone found her, but she sure can't act her way out of this...even though it's a rather simple role. Overall, the whole movie contains exactly ONE scene that is worth mentioning and that is the accident sequence in which Caine loses his hand. Not much, is it? Oliver Stone might be a master in certain fields but, when it comes to horror, he surely needs a helping hand? NEXT!</fullReview>
