		<shortDescription>In one of her most natural performances, Liz is a cheerful light, buoyant in movement?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Father of the Bride" is a mainly delightful family comedy which benefits from a strong central performance...One night at dinner, daughter Kay casually announces her engagement... Father and mother react on cue...Following practically all the events of Edward Streeter's charming novel, the Oscar-Nominated screenplay is a series of comic and warm set pieces: the loving father asks his daughter to invite his future son-in-law for dinner; girl's parents meet boy's parents; prospective bride quarrels with prospective groom... The vignettes are applied with the light Minnelli touch at its most charming, and they are acted with captivating nonchalance by the incomparable Spencer Tracy in the title role and by the beautiful performances of Joan Bennett, Liz Taylor, and Don Taylor? As the complaining middle class father, thoughtful to his daughter's welfare and watchful as to the distributing of his money, Tracy is incredibly amusing... Torn by jealousy, Tracy is all good-natured father exhausted by the complete weight of the problems leading up to the happy day...But it's an ensemble show, and as the typical spoiled daughter of a typical mid-American bourgeois, Elizabeth has one of her joyful screen moments, altering and urging her beloved ones with such gentle, persuasive, winning, and gracious manners?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favourite performance of Spencer Tracy's from all the work he did in thirty-seven years in the movies - here he plays harassed father Stanley Banks struggling to cope with the comedy of his daughter Kay's wedding. Kay is played by the young and beautiful Elizabeth Taylor, who had just been married for the first time in real life; and her intended is played by Don Taylor, an actor I haven't seen in anything else, and can't really remember doing anything of interest in this. The family is completed by Joan Bennett as Tracy's wife, and Rusty (later Russ) Tamblyn as their youngest child.Although the movie does play up the comic potential of the wedding situation - the dad dreams of losing his trousers as he walks down the aisle, for example - it also has moments of poignancy, especially in the last few sequences where the parents dance together in the post-party mess of their once-pristine house. This kind of thing puts the movie above the ordinary, and is exactly what was missing in the Steve Martin remake years later.And don't let me forget Billie Burke and Moroni Olsen as the groom's parents - really funny!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every Father's Worse Nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Father of the Bride" is Spencer Tracy's picture. His performance as the overwhelmed father of the bride is outstanding.The plot is simple. Stanley Banks'(Tracy) daughter Kay (the beautiful teen-aged Elizabeth Taylor) announces her impending marriage to Buckley Dunstan (Don Taylor). Mother (Joan Bennett) gets into the act and before you know it the bills are mounting and father is going greyer by the minute. There is the usual pre-marriage argument between the two lovers, the ever increasing guest list, a frantic rehearsal and finally the big day itself with father trying to maintain his sanity throughout.The supporting cast is excellent. Leo G. Carroll is good as the befuddled caterer, Melville Cooper does a funny bit as the church deacon and the still beautiful Billie Burke along with Moroni Olsen appear as the parents of the Groom."Father of the Bride" under the able direction of Vincente Minnelli, is the kind of family comedy that we rarely see anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tracy's Narration, Liz's Face Highlight This Better Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who like a light comedy diversion, this was pretty good stuff. Spencer Tracy is excellent as a "father of the bride" and he gives us a good idea of what it's like to have a daughter married off. Of course, Hollywood exaggerates a bit, and not everyone's daughter looks like Elizabeth Taylor, but that's what made this fun and, I think, a hit movie.It must have been a good story and pretty successful for a re-make to be made 40 years later, starring Steve Martin. I watched both versions and would select this one over the re- make. As in most cases, there were more values and family togetherness in the classic-era movies than what Hollywood usually shows today. Nothing against Martin, but it was too difficult trying to top Tracy's performance in here.This version actually was honored quite a bit, up for a handful of Academy Awards including "Best Picture." I don't remember this movie being THAT good, but everyone's sense of humor is different. Also, not being a father it was hard for me to relate to the mom and dad's predicaments here. Tracy and Joan Bennett played the parents. However, married friends of mine who saw this movie all loved it.Obviously, some of this is very dated and a little unrealistic. Any father who still sees his daughter as someone in pigtails and tomboyish when she looks like Taylor ain't paying attention! Then again, maybe all dads see their daughters as little girls, no matter what age.We see something else employed in this film you don't see anymore: someone talking directly to the camera as Tracy does here. I kind of like that. Daffy Duck did that, with hilarious results. So did Groucho Mark. It made us, the audience, feel we were involved with wedding, too.All in all, still a good film which holds up reasonably well if you can look at it as a farce, and a comment with weddings - something that will never change!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Stanley, From Now On, Don't Answer The Phone!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A middle-aged, middle-class, middle-income lawyer has his domestic tranquillity destroyed when his 20-year-old daughter announces that she is going to get married. Stanley Barnes, nominal head of the Barnes household, finds himself increasingly marginalised as the wedding approaches.Tracy underplays Stanley and judges his performance beautifully. He is the staid old dinosaur at the centre of the hubbub. Whereas Steve Martin in the 1991 version played the father as a manic plunger into other people's swimming-pools, Tracy can raise a laugh by lying motionless in bed, staring into space.Stanley's wife Ellie is played by Joan Bennett, and hers is the comedy of manners, manoeuvring through the various social minefields which she encounters. She restrains Stanley from yelling in front of the domestic help, harbours doubts about Kay and Buckley (unlike Diane Keaton's character in the remake) and gets nervous and embarrassed in front of the in-laws. It is touching for us to learn that she regrets not having had a white wedding of her own, and this gives her a credible motivation for the spendfest which follows.This film is surer of itself than is the remake, at least in part because in 1950 the social demarcations were clearer and more solidly-grounded. The Barnes family lives in a bourgeois community in which the 'rules' are universally understood. There has to be an engagement party, and a formal visit to the in-laws. These procedural steps en route to the wedding are unquestioned. In the 1991 version, the notion of 'being middle class' has expanded and grown nebulous. The in-laws are simply richer, not socially superior. The milestones towards the marriage are fumbled for - no-one is comfortable with the protocol. Even the man-to-man talk feels inappropriate.Interestingly, Stanley is able to get away with being a garrulous bore. Martin strives for the viewer's sympathy, whereas Tracy is assured enough to let his character have shortcomings. He does not need to swing from ballustrades to get laughs, because he has enough presence and authority simply to be what he is, and to allow the humour to arise out of the situation.Tracy can, however, mime with the best of them. The slightly-too-short waistcoat is great fun, and his silent reactions to the bust-up and reconciliation are marvellous. The film contains lots of goodies, like the expressionist nightmare or the quiet moment when Tracy is alone with the floral displays, seemingly hemmed-in by the frippery of the wedding. Director Minnelli is a master at ensemble 'babble' scenes, and this film has some good ones.Verdict - light comedy, supremely well-crafted</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When You're the Father of Girls?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watch either this version or the Steve Martin version of Father of the Bride, I always think of my poor brother now. He's the father of girls 21 and 19 so he will have to deal with what Spencer Tracy did twice.This film was one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's big moneymakers at the tail end of Louis B. Mayer's reign. It certainly has a theme, one that we can all identify with. 55 years after Father of the Bride came out, fathers all over the world will be overwhelmed by weddings. It will be so 100 years from now.Twelve years after he won his second Oscar in Boystown, Spencer Tracy got an Oscar nomination for Stanley Banks, beleaguered and harried father of one of the most beautiful brides ever to grace the screen. It's on his performance, narrated in flashback by him, that the whole film rises or falls. Of course Tracy never let an audience down.By coincidence the publicity surrounding Elizabeth Taylor's first marriage came as this film was being made and released. Sad that Liz Taylor never settled down to a stable marriage with a loving, faithful husband as Kay Banks did with Buckley Dunstan. But she sure is a bride for all seasons.Of course the wedding, the planning, the cost, the disruption to the lives of the Banks household is the film. Who of us who dealt with having a wedding didn't have to deal with a snooty caterer? A formal announcement party that Tracy puts on and can't enjoy because he's stuck behind a jerry-built bar in his kitchen? A wedding rehearsal that can't seem to come off? Universal and timeless themes.Joan Bennett registers well as the patient and loyal mother of the bride who has to deal with both her husband and daughter losing their minds to pre-wedding jitters. Moroni Olsen and Billie Burke and their son, Don Taylor, do just fine as the groom's side. And Leo G. Carroll is the wedding caterer from snob city. Maybe Clifton Webb could have done it better, if MGM could have afforded him, but Carroll is just fine.My favorite moment in Father of the Bride is in the midst of all the chaos, Tracy looks at the older of Taylor's two brothers, Tom Irish, and tells him with great relief that when he gets married, his only contribution to the wedding will be him. My brother has to go through two daughters before he can say that to my nephew.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A catered affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vincent Minelli deserves all the credit in directing this delicious 1950 MGM comedy. The mere idea of having Spencer Tracy playing the father of the bride, after his many years of portraying heavier characters, is in itself a triumph!The film was tremendously successful because of the casting of Elizabeth Taylor, in all her beauty. Ms. Taylor is an example why more fathers will go into the poor house when their daughters decide to marry, and must have an elaborate wedding. Of course, those were other times, poor Stanley Banks didn't have to spend so much money to marry her daughter. Had it been today, it must have cost a small fortune to do a modest ceremony with a few hundred guests. The way they figured the cost of the affair was less than three dollars per person! Incredible!In a way, this picture points out to the basic problems of having a social event of this magnitude when the parents are well connected, as is the case with the Banks. In fact, watching the reception, we realize most of the people attending the celebration are friends of the parents. We hardly see any young friends of the couple, with the exception of the ones in the wedding party. Imagine having to spend so much money knowing most marriages will end in divorce! Oh well.Spencer Tracy makes a wonderful father of the bride. He was at the top of his career; he makes us believe he is the man losing his daughter and having to pay for it in the process. Joan Bennett makes a delightful Ellie, the mother of the marrying girl. Elizabeth Taylor not only was beautiful, but in this film, one can't keep the eyes away from her for a second. The supporting cast was excellent. Mr. Minelli brings all these characters together in a comedy, that although a bit dated, will charm anyone because of the excellent cast in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true comedy of errors!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FATHER OF THE BRIDE tells the tale of how the once perfectly serene Banks household, led by genial would-be patriarch Stanley Banks (Spencer Tracy), deals with the trials and tribulations that come with the wedding of the family's sweet daughter Kay (Elizabeth Taylor) to her earnest suitor Buckley Dunstan (Don Taylor). Pretty much anything that can cause a father's hair to gather even more grey streaks happens in the run-up to this wedding--first, the bills (as indicated in the tagline to the film) start pouring in... then he realises that his wife Ellie (a Joan Bennett almost unrecognisable from her role as Amy March in 1933's LITTLE WOMEN) never got the church wedding she wanted, so he gives in and splashes out for Kay. The guest lists swell beyond his expectations and financial means; the caterer belittles the planned menu *and* the Buckley home; and Kay fights with Buckley and (temporarily, but hair-raisingly) calls off the wedding. In fact, amidst the mess and chaos of the actual wedding itself, the father of the bride doesn't even get to kiss the bride goodbye.All this might seem mighty familiar to anyone who's seen a 1991 film which, oddly enough, bears the same title, but stars Steve Martin, Diane Keaton and (in a hilarious turn as the effete wedding coordinator) Martin Short instead. The film is, of course, a remake, retaining a great deal of the original 1950 film's dialogue and situations, while updating it for modern times and developing the relationship of the characters further. For example, the two Banks brothers are eliminated for a younger baby brother for Annie (no longer Kay), played by Kieran Culkin. As I recall, the relationship between father and daughter is also better fleshed-out in the remake, as is that between the patriarch and matriarch of the family.However, even though the 1991 remake is one of the most credible remakes of a classic film ever (I would willingly watch the remake--not something I can say for several other similarly presumptuous films), there are still some areas in which it falls far short of the original. Almost all of these areas have to do with the fact that the remake is lacking its own Spencer Tracy--it is his grasp of the role that makes the original film worth seeing to begin with; otherwise one could just as easily watch the remake and not lose very much in the translation. While Steve Martin does a great job as the title character, Spencer Tracy does a *defining* job. Diane Keaton just about every other scene from Martin (as does Kieran Culkin); Spencer Tracy dominates all the scenes he's in. He plays his role perfectly, with just the right amount of frustration, genuine bemusement, and abiding adoration for his only daughter.One scene early on in the film captures exactly what Tracy contributes to his role (as he does to all his others): Stanley lies restless in bed, unable to sleep for worrying over Kay's announcement of her intent to marry Buckley. When he wakes Ellie up and starts complaining, watch Tracy as he keeps listing the different things there are to be worried about--he keeps fidgeting on the bed, almost lying back and then snapping upright again when a new horrifying thought enters his mind. The entire scene just rings of truth and you realise just what a great actor Spencer Tracy is, even in slight fare like FATHER OF THE BRIDE.In the end, although FATHER OF THE BRIDE has a clever script and a generally good supporting cast (Taylor appears beautiful but rather blank most of the time), it is held together by the commanding performance given by Spencer Tracy, and for that reason, becomes a film worth watching. It might also be worth your while to catch the remake, if you haven't already. Both films are sweet and utterly likeable, and a fun way to spend an evening. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film for everybody.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one of his best performances, Spencer Tracy carries this film to be better than it would have been in other hands as the nervous and scared father of the bride. His wonderful mixture of firmness and gentleness make him a lovable character that we all can relate to. He gives us the feelings that he is experiencing while his only daughter, whom he was very close to as she grew up, gets married and leaves his life. Elizabeth Taylor is simply gorgeous as the bride-to-be, and Joan Bennett does very fine as the mother. Vincente Minnelli directs very well, but I can't help but wonder if this would have been better in color with all the dramatic settings during the wedding scenes. Nevertheless, the many colorful emotions that come with a wedding, both angry and happy, are finely displayed in this solid, well-made movie that explores one of life's greatest pleasures on the screen. This is a film for all kinds of people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spencer Tracy Catches the Bouquet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent vehicle for "Father of the Bride" Spencer Tracy. Mr. Tracy turns in an extremely engaging performance, under the direction of Vincente Minnelli. Joan Bennett and Elizabeth Taylor are very beautiful; they look like they could be mother and daughter. Ms. Bennett works well with Tracy; overall, the characters form a "perfect" family. But, this isn't Arthur Miller. Some may find the Banks family dull.Not to put it down (because it is a great movie), but I was really surprised that this family was "middle class"; they seemed too rich to be fretting about such things. This was 1950s "middle class"? Tracy's was the central performance. I liked his "nightmare/dream" sequences, and his narration helped in understanding the character. The ending, with Tracy and Bennett learning how to be closer, was sweet. ******** Father of the Bride (6/16/50) Vincente Minnelli ~ Spencer Tracy, Joan Bennett, Elizabeth Taylor</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's an old saying that the best ideas are the simplest. This is only partly true. The best ideas often stem from a basic concept, but one which yields wide-ranging and elaborate results, and then only if pulled off properly. Father of the Bride has a simple idea at its heart ? a straightforward romantic comedy, told from the point of view of someone on the periphery of the romance. However that idea provides the basis for a neatly structured picture that is both funny and endearing.The screenplay, by the fantastic but rarely lauded husband-and-wife writing duo Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, tells a story on two levels. The actual events of the picture of chart the romance and wedding of a young couple, and this is more or less all that actually takes place on screen. However, the device of a voice-over narrative, as well as set-pieces such as the engagement party shown entirely from Spencer Tracy's position as involuntary butler, make this undoubtedly his story. The voice-over was a popular feature of thrillers around this time, but here it serves as a comical inner monologue and commentary. Telling the story through the father's eyes ultimately allows Goodrich and Hackett to make this a tale not of romantic love but of family and paternal affection, and one that is more moving than dozens of run-of-the-mill romcoms.Director Vincente Minnelli was perhaps an odd choice for this project. Having had his biggest successes with musicals, his flowing, flamboyant style could have been a bit over-the-top for such a small-scale real-world setting. However Minnelli's tendency to lead the audience in a certain direction, and his skillful control of elements within the frame bring a lot to Father of the Bride. He is careful to always keep the wedding story going, often literally in the background, while putting Spencer Tracy in the foreground to give us his expressions and reactions. Usually the background goings-on are very busy, helping them to balance out, as well as giving a better comedy effect as Tracy grumps about before the camera. In the scene where the Bankses meet the Dunstons, Minnelli begins successive shots with a close-up of Tracy's martini glass, to give the whole scene the overtone that he is getting more and more drunk as he speaks. One of Minnelli's brightest ideas is to shoot the chaotic wedding rehearsal in one long take from a distant high angle. Not only does this allow the comedy to unfold naturally, it introduces us to the setting but in a slightly detached way. This gives all the more contrast and intensity to the following nightmare sequence, which is all done in close-ups with dozens of cuts.In the titular role Spencer Tracy gives a typically engaging yet understated performance. This kind of thing was really Tracy's forte. He is essentially a comedy character, since it's his grouchiness and his bewilderment that underlie most of the funny bits. But he's not a wild comic ? he's also very believable and very human, and more importantly someone we can like and sympathise with. Although Joan Bennett plays her role completely straight and very reserved, it makes sense for the two of them to be a screen couple. And while Katherine Hepburn had the best chemistry with Tracy and it was always nice to see them on screen together, Bennett is the more appropriate actress here, because she is more sedate and will not threaten to upstage Tracy, whose movie it is after all.And Elizabeth Taylor, a huge star even then and arguably the female lead, ultimately has a fairly marginal role both in the script and on the screen. Some commentators bemoan this fact, and even prefer the 1991 remake to this original as a result. And yet it is all organised in such a way ? the Goodrich/Hackett screen writing, Minnelli's direction, Tracy's acting ? that brings a depth and poignancy to the father-daughter relationship despite Taylor's minimal participation. Take moments such as Tracy's relieved smile as the camera pulls away with him from the young lovers' reunion after their argument, or his frantic searching for his daughter so he can say goodbye before she leaves for the honeymoon. They don't distract from the general pattern of this being the father's story, and yet they reveal his true feelings, sometimes better than many a conventional scene between two people who love each other.</fullReview>

Tracy is a lot of fun as the jittery father, but while I really liked the movie, I felt that the first ten minutes or so really showed the actor at a highly funny fever pitch which appeared to dwindle a bit as the story moved along and Tracy gradually got more and more used to the idea of the impending wedding. As the young daughter, a very youthful Elizabeth Taylor is absolutely stunning, and a true beauty to behold.*** out of ****</fullReview>

There are a few funny scenes but most of all I was moved by the poignancy of the father (Tracy) as he prepares to give away his daughter in marriage. His pride, stubborness, and insecurities were played to great effect. Taylor looks perfect as the bride and her acting is also fairly convincing. The supporting cast, especially the caterer played by Leo G. Carrol, are also almost uniformly good. I didn't find this film as funny as some other people but like I said I enjoyed the drama aspects. Recommended, 7/10. The vintage newsreels on the DVD are also a nice touch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much better than that crappy remake with Steve Martin. This movie stars Spencer Tracy as a lawyer who discovers his daughter, played by Elizabeth Taylor, is about to be married. He doesn't like the idea after he finds out it's going to be a big wedding and he has to pay for it himself, with no help from the groom's parents. Their's one scene where he says to his son, he can't wait for him to get married so he won't have to pay for any of it. It shows him going through all the motions of setting the wedding up and all the problems that go along with it. Spencer Tracy is great in this movie and Joan Bennett doesn't have much to do as his wife. This was followed by a sequel a year later with the same cast and director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a cute movie. What separates it from all the TV sitcoms that were to follow is the care, time, and expense that went into all aspects of the production. (Except that it was shot on the MGM lot, which would have made more money as a theme park than a shopping mall.) Followers of the more popular TV sitcoms become familiar with the various characters over the course of episodes, sometimes over the course of years. But Minnelli and his cast and crew had to squeeze everything we learn about the characters into an hour and a half so they had a lot more work to do. The audience couldn't take the characters' traits for granted, like Jack Benny's stinginess, Ralph Kramden's bluster, Lucy's mishchievousness, Ted Baxter's vanity, or Archie Bunker's ethnocentricity. In a feature film it all had to be shown first, and then developed in the course of one long episode, so to speak.This was one of a series of what might be called upper-middle-class comedies, which included "Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House." "Father of the Bride" crafts and executes the jokes almost flawlessly.Want to see a great example of intuitive acting, one that probably took more than a few takes? Watch the bedroom scene before the wedding in which Spencer Tracy wakes his wife and tells her how worried he is that their daughter's, Elizabeth Taylor's, fiancé is basically an unknown in their lives. "He's a charming boy," replies Bennet, the wife. "Charm, eh?" Tracy shoots back and unleashes his anxiety. "That's just what these guys have got. Oh, lots of charm. Probably got a criminal record," and so on until he winds up with, "Just the kind of guy who'll probably put a bullet in the back of her neck." Then he rolls over and goes to sleep. What a performance. Tracy rolls around frantically while talking, fluffing his pillows, settling back and then sitting up again, shaking the blankets, scowling at his wife. In TV, there simply isn't enough TIME to devote to a single scene like that, nor are the performers usually up to Tracy's standards.The same goes for the direction. Watch the scene of the wedding rehearsal at the church. It is, as Tracy despondently describes it afterwards, "utter and complete chaos." The scene lasts a good four minutes and involves at least a dozen characters who must learn how to walk in a particular way and recite their lines appropriately. It's both maddening and hilarious. And it's all done with no more than one or two cuts. Minelli's camera simply sits there and captures the insanity in long takes. How many were required, we'll never know, but certainly there were more tries than "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" could afford.Not much is required of the rest of the cast. Tracy is the main show and he provides the narration. But Elizabeth Taylor is drop-dead gorgeous. Russ Tamblyn doesn't have many lines as her younger brother but he has one of the best. Tracy and Taylor have a minor row and Taylor huffs off. "Well, what's the matter with HER?" asks Tracy. And Tamblyn gets to say in his whiny adolescent voice, suggesting knowledge beyond his years, "She's nervous. ALL women are nervous." If you haven't seen this yet, don't miss your next chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great pic with the fatherly Spencer Tracy; Elizabeth Taylor excels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, a word about the main difference between this original story and the Steve Martin remake. The Steve Martin remake is a fine movie, but it is a comedy. The original is, in my view, a real story told with humor. I like both films, but in my view they are not really the same story.If you watch Spencer Tracy's films in order, you'll see him age rapidly in the second half of the 1940s. And here he has completed the transformation into a father figure...in this case a sort of "Father Knows Best" type of father. Yes, Tracy is getting older here, and that phase of his career is perhaps my favorite. This role was perfect for him, and he plays it marvelously. It is this Tracy I remember best.Joan Bennett plays Tracy's wife to a par. Perfect.I'm not a fan of the younger or the older Elizabeth Taylor, but at this age she was a gem, and this is one of her most endearing screen performances.You'll also recognize a number of character actors and actresses, including Billie Burke, Leo G. Carroll, Moroni Olsen, and Paul Harvey. I didn't recognize Russ Tamblyn as one of the sons, although it is a rather minor part.The plot here is simple -- all the real excitement, second thoughts, and planning of a wedding. That's what I mean about this being a real story. Done with light humor, but not a comedy. And excellent film and one deserving of a spot on your DVD shelf.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marriage (and the married life) may be wonderful, but the wedding is something else, entirely. Based on the novel by Edward Streeter, this simple story of the "Father of the Bride" is Hollywood at its best. Despite the fact it doesn't contain an elaborate dance number or colorful sets, this movie shows director Vincente Minnelli at the peak of his craft. Spencer Tracy (the father of the bride) tells of how his daughter's wedding turns his life upside down (and his bank balance.) But, more than that, this movie not only shows life in an average!? American family, but it lovingly portrays the relationship between a father and his daughter. Despite Elizabeth Taylor's subtle and surprisingly effective role as the daughter and her exquisite looks, it is definitely Spencer Tracy's movie. In fact, his expressions and his whole manner and attitude make for the whole plot and the whole enjoyment of the film. A personal favorite highlight of mine is the "they're the ones...the smooth talkers" speech. Director Minnelli puts Elizabeth's looks to great use in close-ups and she truly makes a stunning bride. Joan Bennett is great as the mother. Young Russ Tamblyn is one of Elizabeth's brothers. Billie Burke (Oz's Glenda, the Good Witch of the North) and Moroni Olsen (who provided the voice of the "Mirror, Mirror on the Wall" in Snow White - the original) are the parents of the groom. If you haven't seen this gem, you have missed an essential. Watch this immediately!! Reviewer's Orders!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stick out the first half-hour for a rewarding comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tedious and rather predictable for the first few minutes, this classic finally matures into a satisfying comedy. Without Spencer Tracy in the title role it would be extremely dull, and his belligerent, bewildered, but ultimately touching and endearing character injects real-life sentiment. Scope of film effectively embraces almost-slapstick scenarios with poignant insights. Its close portrayal of mid-century, middle-class American family life now make it fascinating for reasons beyond the original idea. Funniest scenes - Tracy's nightmare on the night before the wedding and his dumbfounded reaction as the quarrelling couple make up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You're invited to a Wedding!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Father of the Bride is a classic tale of what one might suffer when planning a family wedding. And people who have planned their weddings or been in one can cherry pick many comic foils that you may see in this film.The story is about just that. .A simple tale which happens in about every family. Proud papa, Stanley Banks (Spencer Tracey) is now faced with the upcoming preparations of his daughter, Kaye's (Liz Taylor) wedding. It is Murphy's Law running downhill from then on. Expenses keep mounting, families fight over the trivial matters of Wedding dates, reception costs and mounting invitation lists. And from a hot mess, we create the perfect beautiful wedding. Liz Taylor always looked stunning as a bride and you will not be disappointed.A lot of people prefer the remake starring Steve Martin because this event is set in 1950, But it is a classic to be enjoyed because everything that is "old" never changes. So enjoy the show and hope you are the one to catch the bouquet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Spencer Tracy's movie all the way, and that was a good choice. He is excellent as the eponymous, point-of-view character and narrator. He is a bit past his prime as a romantic lead, so being the father character fit him well. Elizabeth Taylor's part was not really all that large, but her beauty was undeniable.This film's release date is 1950, which brings to mind (to me) that it was only five years removed from the war, tough times for everyone, but this goes unmentioned in the film. Perhaps audiences then did not care to be reminded too much of wounds so fresh.So, while not at all an uproarious comedy, it carried a wry wit throughout. Pretty good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is more like a documentary than a movie with a narrative. This has to be one of the worst scripts ever used by such an important director and actors. I found Tracy to be at his most dull. He was never an actor who went over the top, thank goodness, but he can do nothing to make this garbage funny. And he proved in some of the Hepburn movies that he was loaded with wit. Taylor? It's all about posing. Why did this movie need a narration? And there is nothing of any depth to what Tracy's character is saying. Minnelli? Why did they give him something like this, something that didn't use any of his visual magic? Joan Bennett was good, very good. She gave this something that the script sure didn't have. I guess the photography was good. A huge disappointment. I was looking forward to it. It is simply a bad movie. Not a movie that is sooo bad that it is fun. There is no fun here. I thought it would never end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For dad Spencer Tracy to get through meeting his daughter's intended through the wedding reception (where he is not even able to get a kiss from her, let alone the father/daughter dance), it is a tribute to his love and sobriety that he doesn't end up in A.A. He isn't so lucky at the meeting of the groom's parents, and at the announcement of the engagement, he doesn't get to make his speech, being too busy getting sprayed in the face with coke. It seems that you have to be under 25 to be able to open a bottle! Then, there's the 6 mint juleps, 4 bourbons, and tray of martinis he's made which nobody seems to want.This is a story of frustration, neglect and being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Desperate to see his kitten toss the bridal bouquet, Tracy tries to get through his own French doors and gets stuck in a crowd to rival the uptown train at Grand Central during rush hour. Having proved himself a top dramatic actor of the past two decades, he added comedy to his forte, first a series of romantic comedy's with Katharine Hepburn, then this magnificently funny film with Joan Bennett as the Myrna Loy like perfect wife and the gorgeous Elizabeth Taylor as the bride to be.Having made so many generic romantic comedy's, MGM must have been delightfully surprised by this one's tremendous success, both commercially and financially. The reason this one is so superb is that it takes on a different approach to a typical plot. By putting the event being seen through dad's eyes (isn't he the one always forgotten once he's walked the bride down the aisle?), screenwriters Hackett and Goodrich added in a type of comedy that dads everywhere (and their slightly guilty wives and daughters) could identify with.Tracy is delightfully deadpan, and isn't anywhere near perfect. He has a conniption fit when the wedding is moved from the house to a church, offers his daughter money to elope, and nervously steps back from the bride, fearful of falling. Bennett and Taylor allow Tracy to control the proceedings, making this a love letter to neglected wedding dads. Don Taylor is funny as the nervous groom, with Leo G. Carroll an effete wedding planner, so officious in his obvious distaste for all of the choices made and aghast at the house he has to re-arrange for the big event. Billie Burke and Moroni Olsen are amusing in their relatively minor roles as Taylor's parents. This is a humble production artistically, as it spoofs the pretensions of planning an event which really should be so personal and often is overstuffed like grand opera.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a while now, I have loved this movie. One or two scenes may feel unrealistic by today's standards, but so much compensates. The film does look very quaint and charming, I loved the style of the cinematography especially. The script is deliciously witty with Tracy getting the best lines, the story is immensely engaging and snappily paced and Vincente Minelli directs impeccably. The acting is also very good. Spencer Tracy is brilliant and gives one of the best performances of his career, while I have only seen one or two other films as of where Elizabeth Taylor looks as lovely as she is here. Overall, Father of the Bride is timeless. When it comes to the 1991 remake, it isn't as good but as far as remakes go it is not bad at all, quite the contrary. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are lots of ideas out there that give you fodder for a good comedic story,and the idea of a father having to let go of his "little girl" to marriage,as well as the potential financial strain of it all,is one of those that is ripe for the picking.Spencer Tracy is an excellent choice for the lead character in such a story.Who better than the young,lovely Liz Taylor as the daughter,herself a newlywed? This is indeed a funny film that works on all cylinders.My personal favorite moment has to be the dream sequence,with Tracy running late and unable to walk once he hits the aisle,and falling through the floor.Liz's scream at the end was hysterical.This is a classic comedy.I usually avoid remakes of classic films like this,but the 1991 remake to this film is just as worthy of your attention.Check them both out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comments on the scenery, costumes and colorized version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vincent Minnelli was famous for his attention to detail on a movie set. "Father of the Bride" is no exception to his well-deserved reputation. I loved the setting of the Bank's home, the comfortable two-story home on a tree-lined street. Elizabeth Taylor's bedroom, with its fireplace and its generous bay-window made me wonder why she got the best bedroom in the house and if she had regrets about leaving that lovely home to probably live in a small apartment. The family room, with its Victorian couch and leather chair, by the fireplace, helped me understand why the Banks family seemed so close; they had probably spent lots of time in that room together on cold, snowy nights. The kitchen was definitely a product of the 1940-1950's, rather sterile and sanitized, with its white metal cabinets. The idea of warm, country-style kitchens had gone out of fashion by that time by people in the same social class as the Banks. The dining room makes up for that coldness, with the beautiful dining room set and elaborate, silver candle sticks. Ellie and Stanley probably did a lot of entertaining in that room, she with her garden club and he with his clients from the law firm. I have seen the colorized version of the film and I was not offended by it. I rather enjoyed seeing some of the details of the home and the costumes come to life through the addition of color. I could see Elizabeth Taylor's famous violet eyes. The matching baby blue ensemble of matching dress and coat that she wore out on a date with Buckley said to the viewer, "This is definitely a upper-middle class family of the 1950's." The fact that Miss Taylor's wardrobe was so expensive, coupled with the fact that she seemed to have no job except to be the fiancée of Buckley, left no doubt in the viewer's mind as to the kind of finishing school life she must have led as a daughter of Stanley Banks. I once read that her white slipper-satin and lace bridal dress was voted the best movie bridal dress and I agree with that vote. It was gorgeous and she was gorgeous in the dress. Ellie looked beautiful as the mother of the bride in her powder blue dress, with all of its elegance and attention to detail, validated Spencer Tracy's remark that she wore, in that dress, all of the beauty of her own wedding day. Yes, Ellie wore the years well, despite a being a busy mother of three and a woman with many 1950's social obligations. The church, with its elaborate floral arrangements, seem to be stand out more in the colorized version. The salmon pink color of the seven bridesmaid's dresses and matching juliet caps underscored the elegance and elaborate statement of the event and the fact that the father of the bride, in the end, spared no expense for his daughter's wedding. All in all, the sets and costumes were a feast to the eye. I also admit that I enjoyed the colorized version and that it enhanced my understanding of the characters of the movie and their various reactions to a wedding in the family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Father of the Bride (1950)**** (out of 4)A father (Spencer Tracy) is shocked when his daughter (Elizabeth Taylor) informs him that she's going to be married in three months. That shock soon turns to horror for the father when he realizes how much work is going to have to be done in order to pull off the perfect wedding. This here is a wonderful little film, although I hesitate to call it a comedy since the film's main goal isn't necessarily laughs but just making a slice of life story. I think the majority of the credit has to go to the wise casting of Tracy as the father since by this time he was best known for his heavy roles. The actor was always able to pull off comedy but I think casting him as the father, with his everyman type of persona, was just a masterful piece of casting and the actor doesn't disappoint in the role. I love the way he plays the part so natural and I'm glad he doesn't go over the top to get the laughs. Most of the laughs are just genuine little chuckles because the film doesn't try to force the viewer to laugh at stupid set ups but instead just gives us natural laughs as they come across in the story. Tracy does a wonderful job at playing someone who gets in over their head and has to deal with one problem after another while trying to remember that it's all for the good of his daughter. Taylor also shines in her supporting role. Her beauty is certainly on full display but, unlike many stars of today, her talent is also on display. Joan Bennett adds great support as Tracy's wife. I love the pacing of the film and I think Minnelli made the wise choice of making the film seem like we're just peeking in on this family. There's almost a strange, documentary like feel to the movie, which is another major plus. In the end, there's enough charm here for two movies with Tracy once again leading the way with his Oscar-nominated performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Gentle Comedy With Star Performances From Spencer Tracy &amp; Elizabeth Taylor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Elizabeth Taylor and, especially, Spencer Tracy give star performances that make this gentle comedy what it is. The rest of the cast is solid as well, but Taylor as the eager young bride and Tracy as the ever-apprehensive "Father of the Bride" are what really make it work.The story looks at familiar ground from a different point of view, with all of the bustle and preparation of a large wedding seen through the eyes of the man who has to pay for it all despite having nothing to say about the proceedings. Most of it is presented in a deliberately low-key style, but this does not prevent some of the sequences from being particularly funny. It also works as a good-natured satire on the frequently nonsensical side of the numerous social conventions involved.At this point of her career, Taylor was a natural for the part, giving the role plenty of youthful energy while keeping the character both believable and sympathetic. For his part, Tracy was an ideal choice, since his ability to project sincerity and bafflement at the same time makes the whole plot more amusing and more convincing at the same time. (In the 1990s remake, Steve Martin was funny, as usual, but Tracy's more understated approach is even better.)This movie is a good example of a fairly simple concept that works well and is enjoyable to watch. Even for those who have never been in the same position as Tracy's character, it's easy to relate to, in part because the customs are so familiar, and even more so because Tracy is so believable as this kind of down-to-earth character facing the many perils of what 'normal' life has to offer.</fullReview>

C. Fields, or even OLiver Hardy! (Hardy would have done a magnificent job)...yes, some slapstick could have worked beautifully...some camera glances....Tracy always looking at his wallet when the next over charge is discussed. but hey...that's me.rent or buy. nice oldie.</fullReview>

Interestingly, both actresses played Amy in film versions of "Little Women," Bennett in 1933 and Taylor in 1949. Don Taylor, who plays the groom, would have a long career as a TV director.

		<fullReview>I'd prefer the remake any day. It was a lot more exciting since I am not at all much for Spencer Tracy. Most of his movies were boring and frothy. I would've preferred a lead like Jack Benny who was the original pick for the movie since he was in terms of movies given so little to do. And he would've drew much more fire and was more elegant of a comedian. Whereas Tracy, most of the time I've found rather lackluster. The exceptions being the serious movies as Dr.Jekyll/Mr.Hyde, and Judgement at Nuremberg to where there he gave a much more powerful and meaningful performance. Father of the Bride did have good casting and anything with Leo G. Carroll I always enjoy with his appearances. Worth seeing if only for an early role of legend Elizabeth Taylor. I'd enjoy the remake to the original but this is only my personal opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top Notch Wedding Comedy with Tracy As The Father</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Father of the Bride" is such a flawless film that you cannot truly appreciate its artistry unless you watch it more than once. Splendidly cast, splendidly thesped, and perfectly hilarious without stooping to lowest common denominator humor to score points, this comedy was made when comedies could be funny without being stupid. Everything is told from the perspective of the eponymous character. Indeed, the entire movie constitutes a flashback as it opens with a disheveled Stanley Adams (Spencer Tracy) and his wife Ellie (Joan Bennett) sitting in the shambles of their house after their daughter Kay (Elizabeth Taylor) has been hitched to Buckley Dunstan (Don Taylor). Most of the comedy grows out of the predicaments that Tracy and company find themselves in when it comes time to throw a marriage for their daughter. For example, at the announcement of Kay's wedding, Stanley has planned a small speech, but he finds himself stuck in the kitchen of their house mixing drinks for the guests. When he finally gets a chance to get out of the kitchen and deliver his speech, everybody has left the premises. Later, Stanley has a nightmare about Kay's wedding; he dreams that he is trying to walk up the aisle, but the aisle turns into a surreal path and it is little for than a trampoline and our protagonist is struggling to keep his suit on no matter how rough the aisle becomes. At one point, when Buckley decides that Kay and he should honeymoon in Nova Scotia because the fishing is fantastic, Kay almost has the wedding canceled. She complains to Pops that she wouldn't have the opportunity to display herself in all her evening apparel. Predictably, Buckley arrives and they fall into each other's arms. Clocking in at 94 nimble minutes, "Father of the Bride" qualifies as superior entertainment for the entire family. Incidentally, a sequel followed entitled "Father's Little Dividends" with Spencer Tracy and virtually the entire cast reprising their roles under the sure-handed direction of Vincente Minnelli. Other interesting scenes that stand out include the Coke scene in the kitchen when a younger man has to teach Spencer Tracy the correct way to remove the cap from a bottle of soda pop. Another cute scene involves an older Tracy trying to squeeze into his old cutaway suit. Although he manages to squeeze into it, Stanley later splits the seams in the back when he struggles to open two jammed door. Yes, Steve Martin stepped into Tracy's shoes for the 1991 remake and the 1995 sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wish Spencer the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TCM is showing this movie for Father's Day and they are so right. I wish I had the kind of father's love Spencer Tracy had for his daughter. Joan Bennett is so beautiful she could have been Elizabeth Taylor's real mother. This is about the very rich family Banks in the 1950's giving their daughter a wedding (the wedding the mother always wanted but never had). The love expressed by this family and the family of the groom is beautiful. The groom's mother the wonderful Billie Burke the Good Witch of OZ is great!! It's in Black and White and you know I think it is better this way because you see the people not the sets not the glamour of the places and costumes but the reality of their emotions. The funnest part is the dream Spencer has before the wedding, then his sweet little talk with Elizabeth before the big day. I have always thought "Father of Bride" should be co-billed with "A Catered Affair" with Bette Davis and Ernest Borgnine It's also about the daughter getting married (Debbie Reynolds as the girl) but this family are working class. Also great acting and a great story more true to real life of the 1950's. I submit Father of the Bride a 10 because when I come across this movie on TV either in the beginning or the middle or near the end I always stop and watch it. Every scene is a gem.</fullReview>

Taylor is good but her character has no real depth. Some good gags and a surreal dream sequence highlight the film (I've noticed that all Vincente Minnelli movies seem to have at least one scene that really stands out from the rest of the movie for its quality and its strangeness). Interesting subtext concerning man's conventions versus his true values. Able, not flashy direction by Minnelli.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful little slice of life carried by a sweet and wonderful performance by Spencer Tracy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such a sweet and marvelous film, and yet it has few plot twists or dramatic moments. Instead, it's a slice of life film about a middle-aged man who is coming to reluctantly accept that his "little girl" is growing up and getting married. The leisurely pace of the film is absolutely perfect as it looks like you are taking a peek at the life of these real and yet likable people. What I mean by saying "real" is that of course Tracy is flawed (but aren't we all) but much like someone who might have been your neighbor or coworker back in 1950s America. Real and ordinary,...and yet still interesting and sweet. And this niceness should NOT be mistaken for blandness--no this guy is NOT Ward Cleaver or Jim Anderson ("Father Knows Best") but a funny and decent guy with a bossy but loving spouse. His daughter is ably played by the strikingly beautiful Liz Taylor and you can almost feel the dad's pain as he learns to let go.A superb film thanks to great writing and acting. A tour de force for Tracy. Also, if you liked this film, be sure to see FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND--the wonderful sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>terrific film of its kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very well-made *light* comedy. One of the things I like is that you feel it shows the way real (albeit very idealized!) people actually lived, with telling details that make it ring true. On the other hand, the 1991 version with Steve Martin just seems to show a Hollywood Never-Never-Land where everyone has a huge house and never *really* has to worry about money. Another thing I like about the 1950 version is that it shows that rare thing in Hollywood movies, a believable happily-married couple who have been together for many years. If you're interested in that kind of thing, you could also take this movie as an (again, idealized) sociological study of life among the American upper middle class, circa 1950! Unusually enough, the sequel "Father's Little Dividend" is just as good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just mentioning marriage sparks chaos.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a classic comedy directed by Vincente Minneli. Some of the comedy is straight faced making it more laughable. Spenser Tracy plays a self confident, mild mannered attorney who has his household domain and almost every thought preoccupied with the fact that his beautiful daughter(Elizabeth Taylor)is getting married. Joan Bennett, mother of the bride, is more practical, but does her share of providing comical situations. Tracy has trouble realizing that his ideas are not current with the times.Other cast members are: Billie Burke, Leo G. Carroll, Russ Tamblyn and Don Taylor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film has plenty of rough edges, but other than that it's just a harmless, amusing comedy with a lot of warm sentimentality. As the title would suggest, it's about a father whose daughter is getting married and the various complications resulting. Spencer Tracy plays the father, from the upper-middle-class 1950s suburbs, and is funny with his deadpan stares and narration. (The latter, however, gets in the way a couple of times in the second half.) Joan Bennett is quite good as his wife, the calm at the center of most of the storms, (though occasionally the perpetuator of a storm herself!) and she and Tracy have nice chemistry. The final scene between them is a nice way to close things out. Elizabeth Taylor plays the starry-eyed, emotional daughter who goes on about how her intended "is the kind of person who can make everything absolutly,... teribly wonderful!" We, on the other hand, don't see that when we meet the guy, but I guess that's the point? You know,... what does she see in him? As Bennett says, "I know he isn't good enough for {her}, but no one's good enough for {her}." The wedding rehearsal, Tracy trying to uncork a Coke bottle, and Tracy trying to fit himself into a tux that doesn't fit are humorous. Pleasent, not really remarkable, but not bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Father Of The Bride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not very good comedy starring Spencer Tracy and Joan Bennet as a middle aged husband and wife whose daughter is getting married. They have to pay and prepare the Wedding and it is going to be a nightmare. The plot is overall good but it does not have a lot of laughs. I hardly laughed once when I saw this movie. It also was a bit too long and the acting wasn´t good either. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a pleasant diversion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i did enjoy this film,which was remade in 1991 with Steve Martin.this version is more of a romance than comedy,though there are a some comic bits that do work pretty well.this is the first movie movie i have seen with Spencer Tracy,and i kinda thought he overacted a bit at times.maybe that was intentional,i'm not sure.Steve Martin overacted in his version too,in my opinion.i find it amusing how back then in the 50's they weren't allowed to show a couple sleeping in the same bed,and of course there's a scene where the husband and wife are sleeping in separate beds in the same room,less than a foot away from each other.this trend continued into the 70's.anyway,for a pleasant diversion,you can't go wrong with this movie.for me,Father of the Bride (1950)is a 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Father of the Bride" is really a bit of a downer. As many people probably know from the Steve Martin remake (which is a virtual recreation by the way), Spencer Tracy plays dad to engaged daughter Elizabeth Taylor. He's having all sorts of issues with his little girl venturing out on her own, which manifest themselves as crotchety grumblings about how expensive everything is or dislike for her fiancée. Of course, because this is supposed to be funny, mom and daughter just think cranky Dad is out of touch, so they ignore him or dismiss him, until in the film's final moments, Tracy receives a too-little-too-late phone call from Liz, who's just left for her honeymoon and tells him how much she loves him.Thanks for nothing, kid. Not a laugh is to be had in this ever-so-slightly grueling "comedy." The film consists almost entirely of watching Tracy grouse around and get his feelings hurt---because he reminded me so much of my wife's father when we got married, his character was almost unbearably sad. Vincente Minelli directs with a rather heavy hand, and the film feels much longer than its 90+ minute running time.The Steve Martin version actually makes for a funnier movie, because it doesn't take itself quite so seriously.Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Listen! I don't care if you come or not!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not afraid to stand on my little soapbox and say that typically I find that originals are enormously better than any remake could ever dream to be. When creating a remake, one can never seem to find that perfect balance that was found in the original. The characters, the unique situations, and the overall charm seem to be thrown out the window in luau of big box office names, CGI, and overdrawn clichés. We all complain about them when we leave the theater and snicker when we see it. Well, I am here to say that finally, I have been proved wrong. The 1950s version of Father of the Bride was a far inferior version to the recent Steve Martin remake. Yes, you have heard it here first, but the Spencer Tracy/Elizabeth Taylor version lacked the humor, wit, and realism of insanity that the remake had. Tracy seemed like a distant father, not caring much about his actual daughter, but more about the expense of the wedding. Joan Bennett was nothing more than an emotionless cardboard wife that seemed to be harboring a disturbing hatred towards her present life. Elizabeth Taylor was a rich snob that was used to draw in audiences by using the classic "eye candy" trick. The story, the characters, the actors, the "dated" sensation of this film only confused me further on how this version of Father of the Bride could ever be considered a "classic".I do not want to use this forum to compare this version to the Steve Martin version, but there were obvious problems with this film from the beginning. The complete lack of excitement from either parent when Taylor announces that she is getting married (and did anyone find that scene entirely random?) shocked me. Even though we live in a completely different era, shouldn't there have been at least some reaction from Bennett and Tracy? Tracy tried hard to convey the idea that he was worried about loosing his "little girl", but what I witnessed instead was an issue of money. You could read in Steve Martin's eyes that he loved his little girl, and his focus was making sure that she wasn't marrying the wrong man. This older version of Father of the Bride has a central theme that revolves around money. Everything that happens in this film eventually leads back to Tracy complaining about how much money they are spending. I was surprised because I wanted to see Tracy react to who Taylor was marrying, not how much he had to spend to make her happy. It seemed to debunk the entire film and place this negative image on the entire marriage/event. The scene where Tracy asks Taylor to just run away and get married for $1200 was idiotic. This only solidified the randomness of the film and how Tracy had trouble grasping the true meaning of the picture.When the centralized theme is completely destroyed, one can only guess that a domino effect will occur which will hurt other avenues of this film. That is why the acting was so atrocious. Tracy showed no emotion about his daughter getting married. From the moment she informs the family of her decision until the final anti-climax climax when he shuffles around to find her, he never really opens himself up to her. That is what I needed to see between Tracy and Taylor, one of those father/daughter-bonding moments. Director Minnelli tried with the "late night snack" scene later in the film, but by that point I had lost it with Tracy. The same can be said for Joan Bennett, who literally went through every scene without a smile or a hint of emotion. I felt as if Tracy and Bennett were the epitome of a waspy family whose main concern was money instead of emotion. Could we get some passion into anyone in this film? Hugging seemed to be the most valued way of demonstrating love, and while I realize that cinema was different then, did it have to be so unrealistic? I hated Tracy and Bennett's portrayal of husband and wife, which eventually turned me away from ever seeing them as an actual family, which only hurt this film further.Finally, I would like to say that there was one scene that I did enjoy and if the entire film would have had the same creativity then perhaps it could have redeemed itself. I loved the dream sequence that Tracy had about walking down the isle. I though that it was reminiscent of director Tim Burton's early work. The black and white stripes gobbling up Tracy was perhaps a bit of an excited moment for me because it was something I was hoping for. Some evil floor devouring this mismatched actor. Alas, it was only a dream, but can't we all dream? There was more scenes like this needed to really demonstrate the fears (outside of monetary issues) of loosing a daughter and the insanity of a marriage. There wasn't, which again, hurt this film further.Overall, I didn't enjoy this film as much as I was hoping. I had always heard that this was a better version than the remake with Steve Martin, but upon watching it I found out it was not. This was a very unemotional, unapologetic look at the financial side of getting married. Tracy cared more about the dollar amount that he was spending instead of the interest of his own daughter. It was pathetic. There were a total of two decent scenes in the entire film (Tracy getting eaten by the floor and when he gets plowed at the in-law's house), but outside of that it was nothing but shambles. It hurt to watch this film because you knew it could have been better. With physical comedy, better actors, and a stronger emphasis on the true themes of the film, Father of the Bride may have been a winner.Grade: ** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's remarkable to see how some movies either grow in value as time goes by -- such as VERTIGO. Shunned when it was released in 1957 because it was a "departure" from Hitchcock's more explicit suspense films, it slowly took a life of its own and by the time it was restored, nearly forty years later, it had become such a revered object of awe that books were written about it, movies were filmed around its theme, and by now it has been widely considered Hitchcock's masterpiece.Vincent Minnelli's FATHER OF THE BRIDE, sadly, can't be considered as a movie that seen nearly sixty years later retains its values. At the time of its release, it was a huge monetary success for MGM, but as is the case with movies that become box-office money makers, their initial acclaim has more to owe to its stars of the moment (in this case, Elizabeth Taylor in her first adult role who was also in the middle of her own wedding to Conrad Hilton, Jr.) than cinematic quality. If anything, visually, FATHER OF THE BRIDE is nothing special to look at as it marches inexorably to its own wedding.However, it can be taken as a glimpse at the lives of these particularly conflict-deprived upper crust people. Nothing within FATHER OF THE BRIDE indicates that anything of relevance has taken place in the Banks' lives and the only event that is about to uproot them is the departure of their daughter Ellie. It's rather jarring to see Ellie break the news to her parents and see how inflexible and even cold they take the news. Compared with its 1991 remake, it seems to be the only dark point of the movie, devolving into an overtly dramatic argument between father and daughter while mother remains curiously uninvolved.Whatever the case, FATHER OF THE BRIDE should be seen to at least appreciate how America wanted to idealize its Family and perpetuate its values. It's too stilted within its own time frame, too encased in its own "whiteness" to really engage me completely, and Joan Bennett is one of the coldest screen mothers I have ever seen -- she nearly ruined it for me. If the movie had brought someone with a warmer personality, I would have liked it more. As it is, I didn't, but I can say I've experienced it once, and only once, as a means of intellectual exercise.</fullReview>
