		<shortDescription>Steve Martin's second favorite film he has starred in. I can see why.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sweetness that "Father of the Bride" exudes does not stem from the fact that it is funny, but rather because it is honest. It's a remake of the 1950s Spencer Tracy classic (which is great in its own right), but has more warmth about it than that film did. It doesn't rely on slapstick as much as it does on the realistic and ironic lead performance by Steve Martin. This is Martin's second favorite film that he has starred in (behind "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" and followed by "Little Shop of Horrors"), and I can see why.Martin stars as George Banks, a wealthy upper-class businessman living in Suburban America with a gentle wife (Diane Keaton) and feisty son (Kieran Culkin). His oldest daughter (Kimberly Williams) has finally grown up and departed the house, and the day she comes home with a fiancée he literally has a panic attack.She's getting married to possibly the most sensitive man in the world, but George is oblivious to this. All he sees are two big words flashing about the room: LOSING and DAUGHTER. But he is even more upset when he realizes the cost of the wedding: about a couple hundred dollars per head, multiplied by six hundred. You do the math.Nina (Keaton) and her daughter hire Franck Eggelhoffer to handle the wedding, and Eggelhoffer is one of Martin Short's finest roles. Short, an ex-"SNL" member, and star of "Three Amigos" (which also starred Martin), is simply hilarious as the ecstatic and eccentric Frenchman. Amidst the ceremony's setup procedures, George cannot believe he is the only one who realizes just how crazy the cost of the wedding is.Let's get this straight: "Father of the Bride" is nothing great. It's been done before, and it will be done again (and it has). Yet because of a likable and warm presence, the movie is more than just the sentimental goo that it nearly becomes at certain points throughout. It's truthful, blunt, and occasionally rather funny, which makes for an entertaining and extremely likable motion picture.This is not Steve Martin's greatest role. That honor would go to his portrayal of frustrated advertising executive Neal Page in "Planes, Trains and Automobiles." But here he provides us with a character almost as realistic, touching and likable. Neal was the character we empathized with in "Planes," and in "Bride" it's essentially the same for Martin. We're seeing the world through his eyes - which explains the reason it is quite often very overwhelming and comical.The movie indeed benefits from Martin's portrayal of a worried father - not as scared by the fact that his daughter is getting married, as he is by the idea that he will undoubtedly lose her to another man. It's a turning point in both their lives, but it doubles for him. Not only has he essentially lost his daughter, but also he has also just been faced with the reality that he is old enough to nearly be a granddad. This would leave good room for a sequel. Oh, wait...4/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good Steve Martin comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I re-watched this movie today after seeing it a couple of years ago. I didn't remember half of what happened in the movie, but even the stuff that I remembered amused me again. Steve Martin is his usual self, very funny, great body language...simply great. It's been a while since I've seen such a good, not laugh-out-loud funny, funny comedy. Most of the newer comedies have less realism, less normal subjects and plots, and try too hard to be funny. While this movie definitely has it's share in sentimentality, especially towards the end, pretty much most of the last thirty minutes, but it is still funny, and you don't lose interest in it. A great family comedy, it is pretty much funny for all ages. This is a good movie to sit down with the entire family and watch. Most people will enjoy it, and most people will find at least a few things to laugh at in it, if not Steve Martins nervous father character then maybe Martin Shorts character with the ridiculous accent. There's something for everybody in this one; well, pretty much, anyway. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious nonsense, but with a deep and meaningfull insight.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, OK, the characters are a little bit "Brady Bunch" - sweet little Annie, the perfect daughter, George, the doting and totally befuddled father, and Nina, the soothing, calming, hold-it-all-together wife and mother. They're a little bit larger than life in this classic comic, but who cares! For any father who loves his daughter, this movie simply can't be watched without feeling a tearing at the heart and a lump in the throat. Father of The Bride can be viewed purely as a bit of light-hearted comedy that mocks the way Dads can sometimes be, but by looking just a little deeper, it contains valuable information that could help many a daughter understand her Dad, and offers many a Dad some consolation that he is not alone, and that someone out there understands the separation pains he is going through as his most precious treasure begins to spread her wings and look elsewhere than the first man she ever loved. This is a tough time for many fathers, and mothers and daughters very often don't understand their erratic, paranoid and irrational behaviour. Father of The Bride explores this phenomenon with what was for me an amazingly accurate depiction of the emotional turmoil that goes on in the head of a man who cherishes his daughter's love and feels threatened and reduntant when another man enters the picture. Goodrich and Hackett have constructed it brilliantly, and Steve Martin expresses it perfectly in this most elegant of love stories. The movie takes some shortcuts - for most of us, the separation pains don't do us the courtesy of waiting till the engagement - they come much earlier than that, when out of the blue some stranger comes into our daughter's life. Martin demonstrates the pain and fear and anxiety that every daughter's Dad feels as some blow-in comes and lays a claim on his beloved child. A must for every Dad with a teen princess, and for the Mums and Daughters I strongly recommend that instead of just laughing and saying "hahahah - that's Dad all over", read between the lines to see just why Dad is the way he is. Loved it every time I've seen it (3 or 4 times now).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember a few years ago seeing Father of the Bride on TV, but of course it's edited and I never finished it, it's sad, I call myself a Steve Martin fan and never finished this movie. It's such a classic in itself and is just a nice family film that's a good watch. So I decided to rent Father of the Bride the other day, I just love this movie. It's one of the rare films that is genuinely good and just means to entertain you, your family and friends as well. Steve Martin makes such a great over protective dad, as much as he drives his daughter crazy in the film, you still gotta love him that he's so protective over his baby girl. Father of the Bride is a great comedy and is a good watch with it's sweet story and lovable characters. Before Meet the Parents, there was Father of the Bride.George has an excellent life: good job, nice home, beautiful wife, and two loving kids, one of which is his daughter who has just come home from Rome getting her masters in architecture and announces she's getting married to a man she met there, Bryan. George is going crazy, loosing his baby girl so fast and now having to deal with not being the main guy in her life that she will go too for help. George has to also deal with the crazy wedding planner, Franck Eggelhoffer, trying to break up his daughter and her fiancée, and Bryan's rich parents.Father of the Bride is a good film and I really recommend it, it's one of those films that you get a few good laughs for and just feel good afterwards. Steve Martin made George such a lovable character, even though he's trying to break up his daughter and her fiancée, you could understand why through his narration and the way he talks, every dad could relate too. Martin Short as Franck Eggelhoffer is a little over done, but still delivers good laughs. Father of the Bride is a just a fun movie that anyone could enjoy, it gives good laughs and might even make you shed a tear.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Father of the Bride" was made back in the days when Steve Martin still had a really funny streak (which unfortunately seems to have ended with the "Cheaper by the Dozen" movies and the "Pink Panther" remake). The plot of course has him as suburban everyman George Banks getting ready for his daughter's wedding, with a series of hilarious mishaps along the way. Some of the scenes just make you die laughing, as you think "Oh my God! They're really doing that!" (you'll know these scenes when you see them). A real treat. Also starring Diane Keaton and Martin Short.I wish to assert that 1991 was Steve Martin's best movie year ever. Aside from this, he also starred in "L.A. Story" and got a serious role in "Grand Canyon". He is a genius, you can't deny that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Wedding Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched Father Of The Bride numerous times over the years and it's still a good family comedy to watch Steve Martin gives a hilarious and heartwarming performance. I laughed at the way Martin's character acted when his daughter announced her wedding plans and the scene that was touching was when father and daughter were outside and snow began falling it was nice.Martin Short's role as Franck Eggelhoffer was both comical and very funny. George Banks (Martin) a middle class man and owner of a sports shoe company has it all a great job, a nice house, a beautiful wife Nina (Keaton) and son Matt (Culkin). He's in for the surprise of his life when his 22 year old daughter Annie (Williams) comes home and announces that she's getting married to Bryan MacKenzie (Newburn)a computer genius from a wealthy family.From then on George is in a constant state of panic because the wedding will cost too much and the fact that his daughter is grown up. However by the end of the movie he finally accepts that his daughter is an adult and has her own life.The rest of the cast gave great performances I recommend this movie to fans of Steve Martin who enjoy his comedy antics 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny &amp; sweet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen the original so I can't really compare the two. On its own merits I thought FOTB to be really entertaining. Of course its predictable, but its meant to be. martin Short is hilarious as the wedding organiser, and Steve Martin is at his dead pan best. Kimberly Williams was excellent in her role as the young bride to be, particularly as it was her debut. The story goes along nicely but I must say the wedding seemed like the most expensive and lavish in wedding movie history, particularly seeming George Banks is your normal suburban father- not a multi millionaire. There are some fairly amusing scenes, but really its a nice movie. Its the type of movie you watch with your mother, or sister and think if only love, life and family were really that simple. In other words its escapism, almost like a fantasy...enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely likable and watchable, not without its sentiment, but it is a very pleasant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not Steve Martin's best film or role, he shines in a very likable and watchable comedy film. His Tom Jones impersonation especially is absolutely brilliant. Diane Keaton sparkles as his uncomplaining wife, and Kimberly Williams is sweet and alluring as his daughter Annie(she looked stunning in the wedding dress), while Martin Short gives a wonderfully fluffy turn as the camp wedding organiser. Onto the other elements of the film, while sentimental in places and perhaps a little unoriginal, what lifts it aside from the excellent performances is the beautiful scenery and cinematography, a nice script, assured direction and a pleasant soundtrack. Plus there were enough laughs to satisfy me, going for subtlety rather than wackiness, making it even more pleasant to watch. Overall, engaging and definitely worth watching. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Father of The Bride- Letting Go</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Father of the Bride is a 1991 comedy remade after the 1950 version. The film starring Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, George Newbern, Martin Short, B.D. Wong and Kieran Culkin was directed by Charles Shyer and is number 92 on Bravo's "100 Funniest movies." Other awards received were Kimberly Williams for "Best Breakthrough Performance" and Steve Martin for People's Choice Award for "Favortie Actor in a Comedy Motion Picture." He was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for his performance.In this remake of a classic Spencer Tracy film, George Banks (Steve Martin) is the owner of a shoe store in San Marino, California. When his daughter, Anne Banks (Kimberly Willams), comes home from three months in Rome, she tells them that she is engaged to a man (George Newbern) from an upper-class family in Bel-Air that she met while on her trip. Early on in the story George begins to freak out at the thought of losing his only daughter. His wife, Nina (Diane Keaton), tries to keep him sane and happy for their 22-year-old daughter. When the wedding takes place at their home with a crazy foreign wedding planner, Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short), controlling the whole thing, George tries to remember that his daughter is all grown up and ready to take the next step in her life. If it weren't for the actors, the film would not be as great as it is. Each actor plays off the other to gave you the full effect of the story. Steve Martin and Diane Keaton worked very well together. But even better, was the connection between Kimberly Williams and Geoege Newbern. When Anne and Brian got in a fight over the blender, I didn't know who I felt I bad for. Both actors stole me from the beginning. The chemistry was so great I found myself tearing up with tears of joy when they wed. One character that really added to the story was Franck. Martin Short did an exquisite job. Although his character was minor, Short did an excellent job making me laugh and lighting up the mood when other characters were angry or sad. His accent was hilarious, and he kept me laughing even when the situation in the movie wasn't exactly funny. The actors did such a phenomenal job, they made me feel like I was actually in the movie. My emotions kept changing with every twist and turn in the movie. One part that really evoked emotion was when George saw Anne in her wedding dress for the first time and he thought to himself "This was the moment I'd been dreading for the past six months. Well, actually the past 22 years." That thought had me blubbering.This film has a dose of every emotion. Perfect for all ages, this movie will make you laugh and cry. I laughed at all the twists and turns in the movie, and I cried when George was recapping his daughters whole life in his mind. I love to watch this movie when I need to relax and have a good time. George has a part of every father in him, and it is amazing watching him going through the journey of letting go of his daughter, and finding a part of himself that he never knew. I give this movie five out of five stars, from the beginning of the movie all the way through the end credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some of Steve Martin's best work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, this review is for Father of the Bride 1 AND 2. If run back to back, they run like one beautiful story. This production is great from start to finish. Everything about it is wonderful, including the story, the acting performances and the direction. This is the best example of Martin's versatility as an actor. His comedic style is rather straight with zany insertions to highlight the otherwise serious atmosphere of his performances. He plays a wonderful straight man-turned-comic-turned straight man. This movie is no exception. His performance is comedic, yet startlingly genuine.Martin Short is hilarious and Diane Keaton is just as genuine in her portrayal of Steve Martin's wife as is Martin's. I love this movie. I love its ability to make you commiserate with Martin's character; with how he feels, and what he's going through. This one brings up every emotion in the spectrum, and I love it. It's less about family, and more about life's curves; the every-day things that make us crazy, happy, sad, and ultimately stronger. It's entertaining and at the same time makes you think, consider, ponder the events which have led us to where we are now.Combined, they rate 8.6/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I also enjoyed seeing this film however the way that the wife talks to her husband and all the sinister remarks makes it a poor comparison to the original. The original is much more entertaining and sweet - something that is lacking in films these days. Everybody wants to hurt somebody or laugh when somebody falls down and hurts themselves. Never go to the movies because they suck - bad words, nudity, bad scripts - i'll never go to see a Hollywood movie again which is why I watched this movie on TV (and still wasn't as entertained as the original film). Don't stars like Diane Keaton and Steve Martin have any say in the movies they make? Why be an actor if you have to be a puppet. I guess the cash is too good to give up, so give up your integrity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched both this movie and part 2 this past weekend,back to back so I'll be reviewing both. I've never seen the original 1950s version,although after watching these,I'm certainly going to. In a way this is like Martin's movie,"Parenthood" but not as serio-comic. It's a perfect vehicle for not just his comedic talents but like so many of his intelligent comedies,it shows he's also a good actor.He's the perfect example of a man who doesn't adapt to change very easily and practically has a nervous breakdown about his "little girl" coming home and announcing she met a guy in Rome and is now engaged.He's a gigantic,cheapskate worry-wart about how much his daughter's wedding is going to set him back. Instead of concerning himself with the real issue that this should be the happiest day of her life. In short,he makes her big moment all about him.He does it in great comic fashion,as he gets more and more frustrated and looney until he lands himself in jail for stealing hot dog buns! His wife then sets him straight and he really starts to consider his daughter more.While no father is 100% accepting of their daughter's intended at first,George Banks has nothing but pure suspicion of Bryan at first. He thinks,"There's got to be something wrong with this guy". Of course there isn't.Martin Short's wedding coordinator not only speaks broken English,it's pretty much torn to shreds funny! : "Do you lahk this $1200 cahk?" George: WHAT?!Within all this great comedy is a touching story about the day one's child is grown up and leaves the nest. Done here without a hint of sappiness. The wedding is a spectacular one and the reception is crowded to the point of the house's walls bursting. It's simply a fun little film worth watching,especially helpful for you if your kids are about to get married or leave home.9 out of 10. 1 off for the predictable "Dad we had a fight &amp; the wedding's off" scene,sure saw that one coming!</fullReview>

Wong and an extremely small part by Eugene Levy. Everyone else in the film was great too. I think Martin Short and B.D. Wong deserve some special notice for this film. They are both hilarious and play their parts incredibly well!This movie is great from start to finish. I would definitely recommend this movie if you're into funny/romantic films. I hope that you enjoy this film as much as I did. Thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where the 1950 version was as stiff as a piece of wood, the 1991 version is more of a reconfiguration of the initial story than a remake -- even when there are scenes that virtually reconstruct the 1950 movie. Now, while Vincent Minnelli's movie depicted a world no one except those living at that time -- and even then, that's a stretch -- could identify with, Charles Shyer brings those upper-crust sensibilities into a contemporary setting and creates a truly poignant study of a father (Steve Martin) who is about to lose his little girl even though she's already twenty-two and an Architect in her own right and is played by Kimberley Williams. We can relate to the complex emotions he has to go through even when some of the situations he gets involved in are the stuff of perfunctory comedy. However, his narration which opens and closes the movie and his quieter scenes point at a deeper study of a man who is perplexed at what is happening, and who's heart is breaking neatly in two. Another update is having Diane Keaton's character a true person in her own right, and who better than Keaton to play a real woman? After all, she's the one who created and immortalized a performance as Annie Hall, the quintessential New Yorker of the Seventies. Diane Keaton is a perfect balance to the maniacal antics of Steve Martin who has plenty of slapstick opportunities. She imbues her character with a sense of intelligence and practicality Joan Bennett could never bring to her own -- then again, Bennett wasn't an actress known for her warmth, let alone capacity to play a real person. In many ways, Keaton plays her role surprisingly similar to the way Katharine Hepburn did in GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER? in the way she openly embraces her daughters entrance into adulthood.Visually FATHER OF THE BRIDE has a close relation to BETSY'S WEDDING with its warm colors and affluent settings. There are moments in the movie that are so filled with sentimentalism it's a miracle tears wouldn't be shed, and even trivial events -- such as Williams' explosive reaction to a blender she receives from her husband to be, played by the underrated George Newbern -- are rife with realism. This is a comedy that is well aware of the type of story it is telling and is far removed from being an all-out laugh fest. The only moments of extreme comic relief are the ones which introduce and involve Martin Short and B. D. Wong as two bridal consultants from Planet X and while there may be talk that their characters' raging effeminacy only prolongs the stereotypical behavior of homosexual men, I didn't care -- this is comedy first and foremost and neither character was the butt of a joke, but the creator of one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. I think it's one of those movies that can make the toughest man a little boy on the inside. It brings to mind how every daughter in a family will always be a baby to the eyes of the men in it. Kimberly Williams does a fantastic performance as the all grown up but still innocent daughter. Steve Martin and Diane Keaton make brilliant performances as well.I don't think the old one is better, I watched it recently and it is indeed good. But it's a serious family drama; personally, I couldn't see the humor in it. This one is much more modern and sensitive. I highly recommend it for men with daughters or little sisters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heart warming film that will make you laugh and cry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first viewed this film when I was about ten years old or so. I instantly fell in love with it and added it to my collection a few days later. This heart warming film tells the tale of a dad struggling to cope with his daughter's impending marriage to a man he's just met. Played by Steve Martin, George Banks delivers a praise worthy comedic performance as he falls into the in laws pool and meets with the wedding planner, Frank, played by the ever inspiring Martin Short. Father of the Bride welcomes newcomer Kimberley Williams to the screen. She gives a decent performance as an ordinary girl in love. There is nothing spectacular about her acting or even her character for that matter. Fans will be pleased to know that she stars in an ABC family original movie entitled "Lucky Seven", in which her character is much more complex. This film as a whole is belly busting hilarious yet never loses the touching effect it was designed to create. A favorite among families and heartbroken women alike, Father of the Bride is a film to be treasured.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Father Of The Bride responds to negative reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This gets a 6.4, which I struggle to believe is an accurate representation. As I write this I'm aware that it's 25 years old &amp; most people have seen it by now &amp; also read the reviews, which makes mine somewhat redundant. Never the less, I felt it necessary to defend this picture against some of the more negative reviews. Maybe IMDb need to look at the way the ratings work. I've seen this with Thrillers as well like: Copycat, The Bone Collector &amp; Kiss The Girls. All commercial successes &amp; which almost define the 90 minute crime thriller sub genre, or shall we say, are the bench mark in which others are compared. Yet none one of these surpass a 6.6. I've read all the reviews for this particular movie &amp; the majority of people (approximately 80%) give this a positive rating - between 7-10 out of 10. The rest between 3-5 out of 10.The point I'm making is that the average Joe with a healthy, positive outlook on life will probably enjoy this comedy caper. It's heartfelt &amp; humorous &amp; the photography is wonderful. They may however be put off due to the small amount of embittered &amp; cynical reviews on this page. I get that this is a remake of the Spencer Tracy Elizabeth Taylor classic (big shoes to fill). The original was released in the golden era of Hollywood &amp; it's a wonderful piece of cinema. I get all that, but it's not trying to be the original, nor is it trying to out do or improve on the original. These circumstances are timeless, Daughters will continue to get married &amp; this version simply highlights the subsequent issues &amp; challenges that the current generation face.I also understand that the Banks's are middle class. I grew up comfortably too in a nice suburban neighbourhood. But I was taught to speak &amp; act correctly &amp; I was not spoiled, neither are Matty &amp; Annie. Also like the Bank's, my parents are not elitist &amp; are the furthest thing from snobbery anyone could ever imagine. George &amp; Nina weren't always that comfortable, they worked hard to get to where they are &amp; they want the best for their kids, don't we all? Although the Banks's may be able to afford it; $250,000 for a wedding? like my parents, George &amp; Nina grew up in a different time when that kind of extravagance simply wasn't entertained, so I can understand George's reservations. I'm afraid social standing has no bearing on this whatsoever. It seems clear to me, these negative reviews that touch on the classes &amp; sociology come from those that are unhappy with the hand that they were dealt or just simply Jealous. Jealousy is where most negativity stems from in my humble opinion. How can a movie (&amp; a family for that matter) with such a good heart be attacked like this, if not for those reasonsIMDb is amazing, &amp; as a movie fanatic it has been my go to site for many years. However, I think the IMDb fraternity may need to accept a few things. 1: Take negative reviews with a pinch of salt, you can't please everyone. The world would be pretty dull if we were all the same. 2: Although generally speaking in life a 6 or 6 &amp; a half out of 10 may be considered average; don't pass on them due to a few poor reviews bringing the average mark down. That 6 might end up being one of your most favourite movies of all time.I site one more example. Twins, in my eyes a classic, I am by no means a massive Schwarzenegger or Devito fan, but it's feel good, hysterical in places &amp; the chemistry between the two leads is undeniable. In my 38+ years I have yet to meet a single person that has got a bad word to say about it. Yet this movie has been at times a 5.9.Apologies if this sounds more like a mission statement than a review. Don't get me wrong, I love Jaws, Shawshank, Godfather, Schindler's etc? But let's face it, we're not always in the mood. Sometimes we just want something goofy we can laugh at. Just because these comedies are not critically acclaimed Oscar worthy 8's &amp; 9's, doesn't mean to say they don't have an equal footing in our hearts and on our shelves. Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and sweet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 1950 Father of the Bride has been on my to-watch list for awhile now, but I caught the 1991 remake on television this morning. It's not a great film, but for a lazy Sunday at home with family, it was an adequate, sweet little film. Steve Martin is great as the stressed out father reluctant to let go of his daughter and the rest of the cast does fine as well.My only criticism is that the film sometimes borders on sappiness. There is a scene before the wedding day where Martin thinks about his daughter growing up and the montage, paired with the sentimental background music, feels a little too saccharine. However, the film never wanders dangerously into this territory and its sweeter moments usually feel genuine and earned.Father of the Bride is not great, but I would not call it cinematic junk food either. It's a cute, gentle comedy that I would recommend for a lazy Sunday or rainy afternoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of the 1950 film of the same name, 'Father of the Bride' is Lovable! A cute, funny &amp; emotional film, that works entirely. And Steve Martin, Now An Oscar-Winner, delivers a knock-out performance as the paranoid father.'Father of the Bride' Synopsis: George and Nina Banks are the parents of young soon-to-be- wed Annie. George is a nervous father unready to face the fact that his little girl is now a woman. The preparations for the extravagant wedding provide additional comic moments.'Father of the Bride' is a complete family entertainer. It caters to all ages. Its for everyone. Charles Shyer, Nancy Meyers, Frances Goodrich &amp; Albert Hackett's Screenplay is wonderful, it offers funny &amp; emotional moments, simultaneously. Charles Shyer's Direction, on the other-hand, is tender. Cinematography &amp; Editing are appropriate.Performance-Wise: Steve Martin is the life of the show. He delivers a knock-out performance in the central role. Diane Keaton is simply brilliant in her part. Kimberly Williams is cute. George Newbern is earnest. Martin Short is hilarious in a cameo.On the whole, 'Father of the Bride' is a massive winner!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All smiles no wrinkles, Father of the Bride 1991 remake of the 1950 movie of the same name, is a movie that touches every area of the heart, making you smile all the way through, as you look forward to giving your own child away.The cast brings warmth, the combination and ploy done by George Banks (Steve Martin) who can arguably be regarded as the cheapest man alive, were all too funny to make you turn away. After seeing this movie at a young age I couldn't wait to get another dose of it again, hunting down the DVD so as to see George, Frank (Martin Short) and Nina (Diane Keaton) plan a perfect wedding to give their beautiful daughter away.My sight for sore eyes in this flick is the beautiful wedding sneakers that George made for his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) just before her wedding. This movie can be said to be the best comedy that Steve Martin pulled, it is all cheers for you and the family.The movie plot is a narration from George Banks to us the viewers about the things that led to his daughter's wedding. George is a successful owner of an athletic shoe company; he hasn't seen his daughter (Annie) for a while since she went to Europe so he eagerly awaits her arrival from Rome. Annie's arrival came with a surprise; she is engaged to be married to a certain Bryan Mackenzie (George Newbern).George who stills see's Annie as his little girl was finding it hard to cope with the fact that his little girl was about to be a woman. To make matters worse he also has to pay for a flamboyant wedding that he did not plan for. George being extremely cheap now starts to think of ways to cut cost, and with the whole wedding plan all going on around him, George was in line for a nervous breakdown.Father of the bride was the breakthrough role for Kimberly Williams, and it was a revival for Keaton who has been having flops after flops for years affecting her relationship with Disney, who didn't want to cast her in this movie in the first place.Father of the bride is both a critical and financial success, it currently holds a 72% approval rating on the aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes and it spawned a sequel Father of The Bride 2 in 1995.Here is a DVD collection that you should buy and keep watching anytime you feel blue.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charles Shyer directs this remake of the original classic comedy starring Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor. This modernized retake has George Banks(Steve Martin)coming a little unglued upon the announcement of his daughter Annie's(Kimberley Williams)marriage to an independent communications consultant. Groom-to-be Bryan(George Newbern)tries to do everything right to make the best impression; Daddy Banks is just more than sentimental about "losing" his daughter, but he completely warps when he finds out what the wedding will end up costing. Trying to not get got up in the wedding planning, George thinks back about the good times he has had with Annie. Diane Keaton plays the mother of the bride. Martin is pretty funny without getting ridiculous. And the bride couldn't be more lovely. Also in the cast: Martin Short, Kieran Culkin, Peter Michael Goetz and Kate McGregor-Stewart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remake That is Delightfully Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this 1991 updated remake of 'Father of the Bride', we find Steve Martin as a neurotic, stressed out father, George Banks, learning that his adult daughter is getting married, and it is up to him to make her the happiest bride at the most lavish wedding. Co-starring Kimberly Williams in her breakout role, Diane Keaton in a superb performance as the mother of the bride, and Kieran Culkin as the younger brother, Matty. Martin Short, of course, is the comedic center of the film as Franck, the wedding coordinator, who throughout the movie, is a pest to Steve Martin's character. A highlight of this film is that Steve Martin narrates as well. One of the best wedding movies of the 90's and most likely rejuvenated the wedding movie craze. A wonderful film, and one that should not be missed, 9/10! Also, don't miss Part II!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very Funny movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steve Martin as usual is very good in almost every movie he makes in my opinion. This movie is very funny. The story is very simple, yet, wonderful. In terms of acting its extremely well done. Sets are are also very good, detailed as well. This is probably one of the best "wedding" movies ever, something that made it extremely unique was "Frank", the wedding planner. Every scene he is in, I promise you will not be able to keep your laughs in, I myself, laughed, till I could not breathe. This to me is what makes a great comedy. The humor is mostly oral, not much physical humor. I highly recommend watching "Father of The Bride 2", it is just as funny, if not, funnier, which is quite strange, usually, the first movie is always funnier. Father of The Bride 2 is more the proper ending for the story, although it seems it ends at the first movie. I recommend this movie to people who enjoy a movie that has a simple, yet unique story, and is very funny. Overall this movie is great, there is no particular highlight, everything is excellent, but yes, Frank stands out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Endearing and sweet family comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose if I were anything other than a middle class white American, "Father of the Bride" might not have warmed my heart the way it did, but to be fair, family comedies don't any sweeter or more genuine than this story of a father coming to terms with his daughter growing up and moving out.Casting Steve Martin in the role of overreacting and overprotective father George Banks was a fantastic choice. Of all the aging '80s comedy icons to pick from, no one pairs the sentimental with the neurotic and herky-jerky like Martin. The gooey nature of the movie keeps him from going overboard like in "The Jerk," but instead he keeps the movie interesting. Always playing irrational characters, there's the chance he might do something crazy, even if he rarely does, that keeps us entertained.That's helpful, because there's not a whole lot of real conflict going in "Father of the Bride." One pivotal point in the film is the bride-to-be Annie (Kimberly Williams) crying that the wedding is off because her fiancée bought her a blender. In an earlier scene, the script entirely avoids a nasty conflict when George ends up in his future in-laws' pool after snooping around their house. He falls in and they cut away to a new scene. Without Martin's help, this movie is about a wedding with your typical father freaking out about paying for it all (when they have a perfectly good amount of money).That's sort of the best and worst part of "Father of the Bride." It's so true-to-life, which makes it instantly agreeable but also completely lackluster. Essentially, the more you can relate, the more you will like the film. There are some very simple truths in Martin's narration that sums up what being a father is like (though I can't confirm that from experience)For being overly sentimental, however, "Father of the Bride" doesn't drip with sappiness, which is really commendable. It's just sort of honest and genial and easy to relate to. Not many films like it can say it, but this one can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Father of the Bride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as I can work out, it is after this film that the career of Steve Martin has had very few laughs, which is a shame, he just needs to find the right film. Anyway, this is the remake of the 1950 film, and it sees middle aged father George Banks (Martin) with wife Nina (Diane Keaton) having to prepare the wedding for their 21-year-old daughter Annie Banks (Kimberly Williams-Paisley). They had never met her fiancée Bryan MacKenzie (George Newbern), living an upper class with his parents in Bel-Air, but George tries to keep his feelings about wedding preparations and this new man in his daughter's life intact. But it is mainly the thought of never seeing his daughter again that gets to George the most, and it is only after a near cancellation (over a blender) that he understands he has to let go and reunites the happy couple. So the wedding day comes, George walks Annie up the aisle, and the rest of the day he can't even say his final goodbye before they leave for honeymoon, but at least she called him. Also starring Home Alone's Kieran Culkin (Macaulay's brother) as Matty Banks, Martin Short as Franck Eggelhoffer, B.D. Wong as Howard Weinstein, Peter Michael Goetz as John MacKenzie, Kate McGregor-Stewart as Joanna MacKenzie, Carmen Hayward as Grace and April Ortiz as Olivia. Martin does do well, Keaton offers a good support, and Short adds giggles as the foreign wedding organiser, and while there are one or two good gags, it is the mushy bits (which I'm not always up for) that actually do most good. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great reminder about how good Steve Martin used to be - 83%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mere 15 weeks and 6 days away from my own wedding (not that I'm counting or anything), I felt the urge to view a cinematic wedding in order to allay any fears I currently have about my own. After all, an actual wedding will never be the same as a Hollywood one - for starters, arranging a wedding is rarely a comedic event in real life! But thanks to a genuinely touching script and a brilliant performance from Steve Martin in his heyday, this movie is something of a guilty pleasure for me personally. It may be gentle and inoffensive family viewing but there's nothing wrong with that - this would be the last good film Martin would be in until 1999's "Bowfinger" and he hasn't done anything of any quality since. So before he completely wrecks his career with rubbish like the "Pink Panther" remakes, take a moment to remember how good he can be at both funny and emotional.In a remake of the 1950 Spencer Tracy original, Martin plays George Banks who is a successful businessman living in LA with his wife Nina (Diane Keaton). When their daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) returns from Europe engaged to well-to-do Bryan McKenzie (George Newbern), George struggles to cope with the news and begins to go off the rails, especially when he feels pushed out by extravagant wedding planner Franck (Martin Short). But as the wedding gets nearer, he begins to realise that his daughter has grown up but letting go is harder than it seems.It's easy for recent movie-goers to discuss Steve Martin after his latest efforts. But here, Martin is brilliant as Banks as he displays heart-breaking affection and comic timing that is nor just effective but the mark of a man at the very height of his powers. By contrast, his "Three Amigos!" co-star Short gives it his all as the camper-than-Christmas wedding planner and by any other degree, you'd say he matches Martin all the way. Keaton &amp; Williams provide support for the two comic veterans but what separates this from other wedding-based comedies is the touching, emotional aspect of saying goodbye to your child and relinquishing your responsibilities as a parent and guardian. It's like another great Steve Martin flick "Planes, Trains And Automobiles" in that he alternates between splitting your sides and jerking your tears within the same scene and he's the same here. There are moments that don't quite ring true - the scene with the cars parked in the street, for example - but by and large, this is a great comedy that is suitable for the whole family.Hopefully, our wedding will be considerably less chaotic and expensive - if this is Hollywood's idea of a modest wedding then I'd rather get married over here - but when all is said and done, everyone will have a good time and that's how this movie is. It's safe, predictable and about as controversial as a game of cricket and that's fine by me - it doesn't stop it from being something of a hidden gem, albeit a guilty pleasure for viewers like myself. But it's great to watch Martin at his best, before he started to lose his powers completely and appear in dross like the "Sergeant Bilko" remake. I can't compare it to the original because I've not seen it but regardless, "Father Of The Bride" is a better movie than it has any right to be and for that, it is to be congratulated.</fullReview>

There is a hilarious segment where he has an encounter with a ferocious dog while visiting the in-laws. Kimberly Williams-Paisley is charming. Martin Short and BD Wong play caricatures and manage to both annoy and amuse. The film is a watchable entertainer.Overall 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining story of a father (Steve Martin) having to let go.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some SPOILERS are contained in the following review for my own recollection, you may not want to read unless you have seen the movie.I like Steve Martin. He and I are about the same age. Two other movies of his that I like a lot are 'Roxanne' and 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.' Here he plays a devoted father, George, who had a close relationship with his tomboy daughter Annie, now 22, and announcing that she met the special guy, she is engaged, and will be married in 5 months. Of course mom (Keaton) is all smiles, but George instantly distrusts the boy, even though he doesn't know him. The whole movie is about George, the father of the bride, and how he learns to cope with losing his little girl, planning and paying for a wedding. It has the funny scene where George goes to the bathroom at the groom's parents' house, picks up the check book, encounters the dog, goes out the window, the check book ends up in the pool, along with George.The movie would be very, very ordinary if it didn't have the wedding planner 'Franck', played with great comedic timing by Martin Short. I remember when I first saw this movie years ago, and didn't know who Short was, I thought he really was a foreigner who spoke mostly unintelligible English. When they first meet him, mom and Annie both understand Franck, but George can only wince and ask, 'What did he say?' That only served to reinforce that he indeed had lost control of the situation. The wedding goes off without serious incident, at 'only' $250 a head, but George misses seeing Annie throw the bouquet, and the newlyweds had to leave before George got to dance with the bride. When all had left, George and mom were looking at the mess and realizing their little girl had gone, the phone rings and it was Annie calling from the airport, telling dad she loved him before she went on her honeymoon. A funny and somewhat exaggerated look at dad/daughter relationships, but as a father with three daughters, I know there's a lot of truth in it also. A very nice, clean movie for family viewing. It's median IMDb rating of '7' is just about right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having been in on planning a wedding now, I can appreciate this movie all the more. Steve Martin as absolutely perfect in the role of George, and I don't have to mention how dead-on his comic timing is. His facial expressions are sometimes the funniest part of a scene. Martin Short is hysterical as the eccentric wedding planner whose accent is so unreal, you wonder how Short ever came up with it! Short and Martin play off of one another splendidly.I think the most over-looked gem in this movie is the radiant Diane Keaton. She is just wonderful as the loving, level-headed Nina... in fact, I think best scene in the entire movie is with George and Nina after he's been arrested for stealing hot-dog buns. They have exceptional chemistry, and they play the parents with spunk (which keeps them from sinking into a stereotypical middle-aged "movie couple").While Kimberly Williams was just fine in the role of the bride, Annie, I found her character to be spoiled and flat-out irritating at times. There were moments when just wanted to shake her! I thought maybe Williams could have handled the character's reactions a little differently to have a little variety and give Annie a little bit more depth. However, the scene between Annie and George the night before the wedding is very moving... it ranks on up there with a "Steel Magnolias" moment. Any daughter who has a close relationship with her father cannot help but feel at least a little heart-tug during that scene.One minor problem I had with this movie was that it was difficult for me to feel sorry for the amount of money the wedding was costing George... while they may not have lived in Bel Air, George drives a very nice car, they live in a large and pretty gosh darn nice house...in SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA (anyone who has ever lived there should know why this is significant in terms of income).All in all, it's a great family movie with several comedic moments, a few heart-warming scenes, some classic lines,and the realism to tie it all together.</fullReview>

He was hilarious, and very funny for Martin's character to play off of.This movie will have you laughing from beginning to end, but it goes far beyond comedy....it also reached into the dramatic genre, mostly in the storyline between the title-featured father and his daughter the bride. I highly recommend this movie for anyone...it's especially fun if there's a wedding right around the corner in your family. I give it a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Father of the Bride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a remake of the 1950s film of the same name, Steve Martin plays shoe factory manager George Banks whose 22-year daughter Annie (Kimberley Williams) unexpectedly announces her plans of marrying a computer system designer named Bryan (George Newbern) who she only recently met on her trip to Italy. Of course, the new father-in-law gets highly protective of his girl and suspicious about the groom and his wealthy parents (Peter Michael Goetz and Kate McGregor-Stewart). The elaborate and costly wedding arrangements are also a major source of stress for George who must learn cope with the feeling of not being the number one man in his daughter's life anymore.Steve Martin is a decent comedian, so the humour works best when it relies on his screen-persona and puts less emphasis on crazy situations. Luckily, the movie stays pretty down-to-earth for the most part and allows Martin to create the mood with his somewhat realistic performance and verbal jabs that invariably work much better than the more outlandish scenes, such as Martin jumping from a balcony or falling into a swimming pool. However, the characters of Martin Short as the flamboyant wedding planner Franck Eggelhoffer and B.D. Wong as his assistant Howard are so grossly exaggerated that they are much closer to irritating than funny. Since the soon-to-be husband and wife aren't really developed enough to make them very interesting and Diane Keaton plays her part as the mother of the bride with a constant smirky smile that makes her come across as rather unnatural in the role, the movie can essentially be called a one-man show of Steve Martin who fortunately suits the role well.At the end of the day, the appeal of Father of the Bride depends on the charisma of Steve Martin and the perceived touchingness of the theme of letting go of your daughter. Perhaps the serious story can feel moving to those with personal experiences of seeing one's offspring get married, but others, such as myself, may think of it as cheesy and a bit too soft in the end. Still, there are many successful jokes and the tone is suitable for the whole family, so if the premise sounds interesting to you, you may well enjoy the movie more than I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to ignore Steve Martin's comedy, but, the film makes me cringe, especially if this movie is seen in countries whose citizens think this is the "average" American family of today. For example, George's opening comment that he lives in an "average" house - one that looks like it came from a magazine cover - would today sell for several million dollars! What also makes me cringe is the shear extravagance, with Mom justifying it all because "we don't go to Europe" - again, it must give non-Americans (especially those in third-world countries) the idea that every American citizen lives this way, and, is easily able to spend incredible sums of money on an afternoon wedding.While this film may have been good for a laugh in the early '90s, today's world is much different, and poorer (even for Americans), and, considering the often harsh criticism of American values today, perhaps it's time for this film to be removed from distribution - before it misleads anyone else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FATHER OF THE BRIDE, in my opinion, is one of the most romantic, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen. If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Martin Short sported his accent. Kudos to Charles Shyer and everyone involved for a job well done. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, or Martin Short, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the warm, homey feeling this movie has, and you can relate to the characters. Even though I've seen this movie many times, I still HOWL at these 2 scenes: George envisioning the wedding reception with crepe paper, balloons, and himself slinging burgers wearing a chef's hat, and the scene where he goes crazy over the hot dog buns in the supermarket! Steve Martin's George is a scream and totally lovable, and Kimberly Williams is radiant and delightful as the bride-to-be. A totally enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George loves his house and his neighbourhood and his only daughter. Into his comfortable world intrudes the eventuality he has been dreading for 22 years - his little Annie is getting married.This 1991 remake of the Spencer Tracy comedy is very loyal to the original, replicating verbatim large sections of the dialogue. It's all here - the sentimentality, the materialism, the self-indulgence ... and the Venus de Milo navel-clock.Martin takes off his shoes amid the post-reception debris and addresses the camera directly, just as Tracy did. The movie proceeds as a series of comic episodes, linked by George's voice-over.Kimberly Williams is excellent as Annie, the bride-to-be. Like Elizabeth Taylor in the original, she has the daffy, unrealistic outlook of a pampered youngster, but manages to make her character much more likeable than Taylor did.Martin plays George Banks with his usual wacky energy. The script is serviceable, with some good jokes, and Martin adds some slapstick and face-pulling. His comical expressions in the 'blender' scene are excellent.Diane Keaton as George's wife has nothing to do. She simpers in the right places, and is suitably sensible as the counterbalance to Martin's antics, but is woefully under-used.The one-on-one basketball scene is a memorable passage, conveying something of the special bond between this father and daughter. An effective and poignant joke is the 'warm coat' sequence, lifted wholesale from the earlier movie. The parade of irritating boyfriends is wisely omitted - it didn't come off in the 1950 version. The bandleader audition is much funnier. Franck the wedding co-ordinator is one of this film's glories, completely outclassing Leo Carroll, who played the equivalent role first time round.The young couple are attractive, Martin is amusing and the story is told competently enough, but one wonders whether the world needed another "Father of the Bride" at all. The original was so good as to be definitive. Surely Martin, with his box-office clout, can find fresh new projects, rather than rehashing movies which can still hold their own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film makes about as much sense as an 'Ozzie &amp; Harriet' or a 'Father Knows Best' episode. An old copy of Reader's Digest (circa 1962) would provide more insight into modern life, or the relationship between a father and a daughter, than this weird concoction.I was surprised with Diane Keaton. She appears to sleepwalk through the film. (Given the film's title, I realize that hers was a supporting role but even Martin Short managed a distinct, supporting character.)I can understand the attraction of an imaginary world created in a good romantic comedy. But this film is the prozac version of an imaginary world. I'm frightened to consider that anyone could enjoy it even as pure fantasy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find Steve Martin's films a bit inconsistent but there is no doubting the talent of the man, and this film highlights those perfectly.There isn't really much plot to talk about really. It's the story of how a father reacts to his daughters upcoming wedding.However what makes this film so special is that it is full of lovely moments and sentimental without becoming cloying.Steve Martin may be the central point for the comedy but credit must also be given to Diane Keaton and Kimberly Williams who do well in their roles. As for Martin Short's role...well, you'll either love it or hate it.Overall a lovely sweet hearted film. I've not seen the sequel as yet but to be honest I think this is one film that could have been left alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Martin Shines in Very Good Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Father of the Bride (1991) *** (out of 4) Very funny remake of the Spencer Tracy-Elizabeth Taylor classic has Steve Martin stepping into the role of the father who finds himself losing his mind once he learns that his daughter is about to be married. The original version of this film is a pretty straight-forward comedy that plays itself out as a rather down-to-Earth and realistic film. It certainly deserves its classic label and this remake is actually a lot funnier, although it does go for a more slapstick approach. I think what makes this film so memorable is the performance of Martin who was clearly given a type of role that would allow him to deliver his comic talent but also give him a few tender scenes. I thought this was pretty much a greatest hits type package for the actor because there's a wide range of comedy going on here and he perfectly nails all of it. It could be the various weird faces and reactions he gives and this is on perfect display when he first hears about the wedding. He's given some physical comedy, which is perfectly done during a sequence where he's in the in-laws house causing trouble. Then you've got some over-the-top but hilarious moments with the best being inside a grocery and involves hot dogs and buns. Martin's given a nice supporting cast including Diane Keaton as his wife, Kimberly Williams as the daughter and then there's Martin Short who's perfect as the wedding planner. The film obviously goes for the big laughs and it gets plenty of them. The screenplay is pretty straight-forward and as you'd expect there are the funny moments but we're also given some more quiet and tender moments, which actually work quite well and especially the wedding sequence. FATHER OF THE BRIDE is a great example of a remake that actually works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it was one of the sweetest movies I watched. I watched two movies today, one was When Harry Met Sally and the other one was this movie. I like this way better than that, may be it is because the stories about family always touch me more than the stories about love. I knew both of these to movies from my text book"the American way", the chapter talks about the American family. I think the movie"When Harry Met Sally" is about the relationship between men and women, and this movie is about the relationship between father and daughter. Anyway, I do like this movie a lot, it was funny and warm. :) And the other thing I was glad about was, this movie doesn't have subtitle, but surprisingly I understood almost all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully funny and charming.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have often thought that Steve Martin always deserved more respect and honor than he has already received, given the fact that he has pulled off both screen writing and acting with unrivaled avidity. And the fact still remains that, if Steve Martin is acting in a film, the film belongs to him all the way. Even if the film is the ruefully boring and a near-disastrous rendition of the 1963 classic "The Pink Panther", in which he played the iconic role of Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau. In "Father Of The Bride", he once again takes on a role made iconic by Spencer Tracy, though this time he gives it a skin of its own, thus succeeding in transforming a mawkishly-constructed drama into a zingy comedy.George Banks' (Steve Martin) life changes when his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) tells him that she has decided to get married to Bryan MacKenzie (George Newbern), a guy she had met in Rome a few months before. Unable to cope up with the idea of living his life without Annie, George finds himself getting increasingly flustered with the preparations for the wedding. His wife Nina (Diane Keaton) finds Annie a wedding coordinator Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) when she finds out that George isn't quite willing to let Annie get married. The plot focuses on the subsequent wedding and how George embraces the little occasions it brings.Something that struck me before anything else did was how quickly the plot kicked in, not wanting to fool around with the frivolous bits. This, of course, led to the protracted development of a few characters though Martin got enough screen time to imbue his character of George Banks with disarming sincerity and embellish him into a likable and congenial father. Though the story roisters itself through a rather predictable narrative, the funny parts come in little details. And somehow you feel as if they weren't put there to make you laugh because they seem so familiar. That's one way to know how delightful a comedy really is, when it makes you laugh, not because it is funny but because how honest it is. "Father Of The Bride" is a commendable addition to that category because it doesn't have to try hard to make you smile. It's a useful little trick and director Charles Shyer sneakily uses it to magnificent effect.One of the many niggles I have with this film is how many insignificant details it cramps in its plot, like the utterly inconsequential scene where George decides to investigate the MacKenzies and finally ends up in their pool after an overlong, overused cliché of wrecking a perfectly set-up meeting. If it was an an attempt to show George's desperation, it came off as a tawdry plea to evoke laughter. The underwritten character of Nina is a minor flaw which could've easily been rectified, had Shyer let the plot unravel at its own pace. At the end of the first hour, George's anguish at letting Annie go begins to take its toll on your patience, and more than once I had wanted to yell "Get on with it!", though I couldn't shake off the feeling that the intention was deliberate. Either way, I found it to be vaguely irksome.Of the performances, Steve Martin turns in a supremely well-balanced performance with his portrayal of George Banks, playing the distressed and hesitantly supportive father with a calm demeanor. Diane Keaton is wonderful in her role as his wife Nina, though a little more writing could have greatly helped her character to be as delightful. Kimberly Williams' lack of confidence in her role as Annie is evident though she maintains a dignified presence throughout."Father Of The Bride" is one of those rare comedies that don't age with time. If you can get past it's predictable plot, it's one film that has enough substance to make your day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am 40, father of a young girl and will always want to watch this remake when it's on. I enjoyed the Tracy/Taylor version, but I connect with the updated version so much more. I agree with previous posters when they complain about the unbelievable nature of the house, the family, the money issues. Many things are fantastical here. However, I love sentimentality and nostalgia in my movies (It's A Wonderful Life is my favorite) and this movie captures the love of a dad and a daughter unlike many that have come before and after. Yes, it's displayed in an unrealistic setting, but the writing and then the acting of Martin and Williams set that all aside IMO. I will always cry (yes, a man who admits he cries watching movies other than Brian's Song) when I see the scenes of Martin remembering his little girl or during the moment of their last round of basketball the night before her wedding. These are very sweet, touching moments that many would think sugary, but when you're watching with your only daughter...it warms your heart and puts a tear in your eye. A very sweet film overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't get enough of this movie, not because its particularly good, but because i love analising it. My problems lie not such much with the 'movie' itself.. but with the BANKS family that take a leading role in this film. This movie is dripping with sugar from beginning to end. The Banks family come accross as if they've just stepped out Perfectville, a magical place where everything is perfect. Honestly.. the Banks seem to be the most sanitised family i've ever seen. They're the sort of folks that go to bed RIGHT ON TIME every single night, get up at the same time every morning, the daughter is perfect.. not only is she graduating from uni at 22, she's ALREADY FOUND the PERFECT guy to marry! She has no problems such as stress, being a poor student, money worries, depression, overeating, drugs or alcohol, in fact she comes across as a middle aged 22 year old. (a very boring one at that)As a previous reviewer stated.. if Mr Banks (Steve Martin) is making a good living and they live in this huge mansion, and everything is perfect.. then why on earth is he worried about spending $75,000 on a wedding? It's only money.. and after all, this is the perfect family, not to mention the perfect daughter. It shouldn't even be an issue for him! I have no problems with perfection aside from the fact that being 'perfect' is a myth and is purely subjective. This movie overdoses on sickly syrupy sugary cover-your-eyes cringey moments.. where everything is just soo sanitised and pure it begs the viewer to slap these characters to snap them out of it. These people (regardless of how rich they are) wouldnt last a day in the real world. They would have heart attacks at the thought of how busy or hectic working/living life/running a family/running a business can be! This is the perfect movie to poke fun at.. and that why i love it so much. All the actors do an excellent job.. it's just the shame the characters are so over-the-top perfect/pathetic. 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

So is Martin Short. I'd highly recommend it for everyone. This is a family movie for all times. Sheer entertainment. Best scene (though there are no bad ones) is when George is lying in his bed and recollecting the highlights of his daughter's life in her childhood, and he's smiling sadly. I adore this movie.

Am I the only one who did the math on this one? I kept waiting for someone to say, hey there bride-to-be, you're asking way too much, but no--everyone gangs up on the father, who is concerned about the price tag, and acts as though *he's* he unreasonable one.I know this is just a movie, and I know it's not meant to be the issue we focus on, but I find behavior like this so egregiously offensive that it largely kills the humor of an otherwise cute movie for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Father of the Bride" is a remake of the Spencer Tracy/Elizabeth Taylor film from 1950. George Banks (Steve Martin) and his wife, Nina (Diane Keaton), are ecstatic over the fact that their daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) is coming home after being in Rome for 6 months. Little do they know that she has a surprise waiting for them, she is getting married! This news doesn't settle well with George, as he has a tough time accepting the fact that his only daughter is grown-up and ready to be on her own. This movie is hysterical, dramatic and sad. Steve Martin does a good job as the father of the bride, some situations and one liners he has are a riot! The best line in the movie is right after he meets his future son-in-law. Diane Keaton isn't given much to do here except smile. Kimberly Williams is gorgeous and kind-hearted as the bride-to-be, while Martin Short is funny/annoying as the over the top flaming wedding coordinator. This is the perfect movie for any family to watch when there is a wedding coming up! Followed by "Father of the Bride, Part II" in 1995.</fullReview>

It was simply the best wedding-related movie I've ever seen, with the wonderful cast and the pivotal role of Steve Martin as the reluctant father of the bride, who could seemlessly spin off an ever-lasting supply of witty one-liners that fitted in so perfectly to the plot of a middle aged man forced down the rocky road of initial shock when he realises his daughter's imminent plan to gradual acceptance as he attempts to pull together a gigantic wedding which will set him back $250 dollars a head. These efforts are heartwarming and our sympathy is fully behind him as the film goes from high pints to low points as he attempts to deal with the stress. Hugely entertaining , heartwarming, life-assuring comedy that is not only very humorous but very emotional too. The cast were believable too, a bonus today when we so often get fed the usual Hollywood stereotypes in these types of film. Films about family values are more common than the cold, but this is an outstanding comedy about a wedding and the changes and frustrations that it brings to a family. One of the great life-assuring films of the decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bridal Cower.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film with charm, grace and laughs, FATHER OF THE BRIDE is a rarity in the pantheon of White American Romantic Comedies (WARC). Firstly, because it's watchable. Secondly, because it is post-comedy Steve Martin and it's still watchable.Remade from the 1950 Spencer Tracy farce of the same name, director Charles Shyer retains that film's original twist on the abominations which would one day be known as Chick Flicks: the film's star is not the focus of the "romance" but the outside observer, as love labors on his daughter, as he narrates through the eyes of a doting, frazzled father.Steve Martin is George Banks, the titular Father of the Bride, who plays his part with the aforementioned charm, grace and laughs. Unlike most WARCs, the father of this household is not the least intelligent member of the family; he is not portly, he doesn't wear flannel shirts over white wife-beaters and he doesn't moon over sports programming like it's gospel. George owns his own business, is a loving father and husband, pragmatic, punctual, reliable and knows how to treat women with respect. He seems caught in that timewarp of a generation that was once hip and is losing its ground on the moving goalpost of hipness.The comedy in this lighthearted farce is drawn first from George's unwillingness to accept his daughter as an adult on the pathway to marriage, and then from the wedding planning. This was at a time when Steve Martin was still Steve Martin, on the heels of PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES (1987) and DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS (1988).And Diane Keaton was still a glorious MILF, glowing as George's understanding wife, the mother of his children. (Oooh, I'd like to mother her.) At times, movie stoops to playing Mother Smarter Than Father, and George is incessantly put upon by many of the characters, but the movie redeems itself with George's surfeit of poignancy, that he drivels all over us at regular introspective intervals. Rather than make us vomit, it hits home all the psychological and pragmatic reasons a father holds so tight to his daughter.When daughter Annie (beautiful newcomer Kimberly Williams) announces at the dinner table her intentions to marry a man she met in Rome, all that George sees is his five-year-old girl blathering it. Throughout the film, George makes comments about being "replaced," about not being needed or heeded any more, but it all boils down to feeling like he has lost his daughter's love. And that's another welcome departure from WARCs: we don't feel - and we don't *need* to feel - any chemistry between the two people who are actually getting married! All our hopes rest on the chemistry between the father and daughter.In the final moments, as Annie and her new husband (George Newbern) are leaving the reception, George has reconciled his protective paternal love with his desire for her to feel that same love towards someone else. And we feel his sincerity. If Steve Martin can sell this story to us childless nullifidians, imagine how he's making those fathers in the audience weep like repentant sinners.The usually less-than-funny Martin Short raises his game here to above adequate as the ambiguously-Euro wedding planner Franck (pronounced "Fronk") who, along with assistant B.D. Wong, debilitates the English language in his quest to provide the best wedding ever for Annie. ("Ahhh, Mahsta Bonks and Missus Bonks and the lofflay bride!") The groom's parents were merely devices for some farcical Steve Martin moments with Dobermans and falling into pools.The annoying side of this film is how the father of the bride - George - is treated like a bottomless piggy bank. He is literally extorted by every contractor involved - on the threat that if he doesn't buy what the wife and daughter want for the wedding they will pout a lot. And it must be nice to be so affluent that when obscene monies are changing hands - amounts that would bankrupt most of us for life - your worst reaction is to pull a funny face. And all for the sake of one of the biggest social scams since civilization went civil - a wedding, which is nothing but a glorified party, just with a white dress and a state contract.Maybe it's a sign of the changing times, but remember when George's social standing would have been called middle class? There is no such class in America in 2011; George would now be termed "upper middle class" or just upper class.How nice marriage can be when you can afford swans and a $10,000 cake; when everyone is painfully white and has a job that actually pays the bills; in a giant house in suburbia with a picket fence, a picturesque, tree-lined street and a dog trained not to thigh-hump anyone.So now the fathers are all weeping for a totally different reason...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a remake of the nineteen-fifty film by Vincente Minnelli. "Father of the Bride" tells the tale, or rather the traumas, of one father-in-law to be and his awkward misadventures in planning (and accepting) his daughter's wedding.Steve Martin fits well into the role of the harassed 'had his day' father who is desperately trying to hang on to his little girl, while Kimberley Williams is an attractive bride-to-be. Comically though, the film belongs to Martin Short as the excitable wedding planner.In the end, "Father of the Bride" is a happy ending type movie that will bring a smile to your face.Friday, December 27, 1991 - Coburg Drive-in</fullReview>

Still, he tries to get used to the idea and when preparations for the wedding go under way the movie provides us with more and more funny moments from the cast.The cast in the movie includes, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams and Martin Short and they all give good performances.Father Of The Bride is a great comedy movie which comedy, movie lovers everywhere will love.

		<fullReview>Well this is really a film that you can watch without regretting it, for it is funny, interesting, moving and last but not least because the actors all do their job. Plus in this film you (well I at least) see things like the main character, dad George (Steve Martin). I at first (though not as shocked about the wedding) also thought that the Bryan, who was to be married to George's daughter, was a bit of a nerd and I also believed that the wedding co - ordinator was a fagot f..k. Well my views changed, I got used to the co ? ordinator and to Bryan. The thing I liked best about this movie though was the bond between George and his daughter. That whole goodbye thing at the end was really moving (probably because I'm almost that age too, when you start thinking about leaving home). I really thought those moments were sweet and true and it kind of made me regret already that I had to leave home at some point in my life.7 out of 10</fullReview>

Of course the wedding plans fall apart and it is up to the parents to make sure that it all comes together without a hitch.

		<shortDescription>Has its flaws, but it still charms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Father of the Bride" is a charming, family-accessible movie that showcases Steve Martin in one of his most likable roles. It has its flaws, some of which get on your nerves, but it never pretends to be more than pleasant fluff, and it will endear itself to you.It's been commented that this almost seems like a parody involving the silly obsessions of rich white people, and you certainly get a sense that there is a lack of perspective on the part of all the characters, and not just Steve Martin, as it's supposed in the film. I mean, $250 a head for 300 guests comes out to $75,000, and that is a ridiculous amount to spend on a wedding. (The original guest list was almost 600 -- for a house wedding! -- and George's insistence on drastic reductions is portrayed unsympathetically.) The poutiness of the daughter, who is otherwise played to perfection by the beautiful Kimberly Williams, makes her seem like a spoiled little brat. Also, in the first part of the movie, when Martin's character meets his daughter's fiancé, the natural fatherly impulse to dislike Brian (ably played by George Newbern) gets stretched beyond reality to something like a reverse Electra complex, and it gets kind of creepy for a couple of minutes. However, I don't find it particularly offensive that Martin and Diane Keaton as his wife both own successful businesses, nor do I find it odd that the daughter is working on a Master's degree in architecture at 22 (most students get their BA/BS at 21 or 22). Just because two people have made successes of their lives does not mean they are bad or money-obsessed people, although Martin's reaction to the in-laws certainly suggests that he is insecure about his own status. In the Spencer Tracy original, the family was rich enough to call their maid by ringing a crystal bell, as I recall, and the naysayers don't seem to have a problem with that.I found FotB to be mostly charming, given that it never really takes itself too seriously. Diane Keaton provides a steady and strong balance for Martin's frequent outbursts of nuttiness, and Williams and Newbern give a realistic portrait of a young couple in love -- even to the inevitable pre-wedding blow-up, which is resolved by an unlikely source. When my wife first saw this (I had seen it when it was released), we were in the middle of planning our wedding, and to this day we can watch this movie and find events that recall our own experiences. It's easy to relate to the movie and to most of the characters, most of the time. Give yourself a treat, drop the class warfare for a couple of hours, and just watch this for the enjoyment of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a feel-good commercial, not a movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1991 remake of the 1950 Spencer Tracy-Elizabeth Taylor sentimental comedy concerns harried family man trying to maintain control while planning his daughter's extravagant, expensive wedding. This story (having been kicked around forever on the stage) is updated in all the worst ways possible, with arms-flailing acting and hammy touches that reek of movie star goodwill gone overboard. Director Charles Shyer isn't a filmmaker (at least not here); he's a purveyor of feel-good sentiments that would fit just perfectly on television, perhaps in a Kodak commercial. Old-fashioned uplift is mixed broadly with slapstick shenanigans for a sticky result. In the lead, Steve Martin works his famous comic neuroses for all their worth, but some subtlety from him this time might've been welcomed. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Banks (Steve Martin) has a happy life. He owns a sneaker company and happily married to Nina (Diane Keaton). He's shocked when his 22 year old daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) tells them that she's marrying to Bryan MacKenzie (George Newbern) whom she met in Rome. He's picking on everything wrong with the relationship whether it's real or not. Soon the wedding gets too extravagant for George as they hire wedding coordinator Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) and his assistant Howard Weinstein (BD Wong).I really like this movie at the beginning. It has the same feel as Parenthood and this starts off as a kind of continuation. Then Franck shows up and it becomes too ridiculous. The point of this is that George is over-reacting but Franck convinces me that he is not at all. When he's not on the screen, the movie is fun and I can laugh at George. It's also a stereotypical flamboyant wedding coordinator which is bad low brow comedy. I tune out every time he's on screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie annoys me.The first half of the movie is Steve Martin rolling his eyes and complaining about the cost of the wedding...AND RIGHTLY SO! At $250 a head and 572 guests, the wedding ended up costing $143,000. This was 13 years ago! If Annie was an even half way decent daughter she would've said, "Gee that does sound kind of expensive. What can we do to get the cost under 100 grand?" But instead she pouts like a spoiled brat because her mean old dad is trying to ruin her life because he doesn't want to spend $143,000 on her precious wedding. And of course mom sees nothing wrong with spending the money. Absurd.Parts of the movie are funny and charming, but the first half of this movie is too annoying.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I decided to check this out because I was in the mood for something light and because it stars Steve Martin and Martin Short (and also Eugene Levy in a single, but funny, scene), and while Short was excellent as the flamboyent, thickly accented, wedding co-ordinator, and the interplay between father (Martin) and daughter had perhaps a nice moment or two, in general, I was pretty underwhelmed by this big piece of not very funny fluff; there are some much better, funnier wedding movies, if one is attracted to the subject matter, including BETSEY'S WEDDING, MURIEL'S WEDDING, and TRUE ROMANCE. Even the wedding scene in the great GOODFELLAS was a lot more interesting, and funnier. This, however, is barely worth the price of even a cheap rental.</fullReview>

Steve Martin and Kimberly Williams take over the parts and do an adequate job, but the film is not fresh at all.

My advice is to see the original 1950 classic with Spencer Tracy and Joan Bennett. The young bride to be in that movie is played by Elizabeth Taylor!

		<fullReview>I was nine when this movie was first released and I rented it again recently as I'm now in the process of planning my own wedding. While Steve Martin gives a great performance as George Banks, and while several scenes are hilarious, I take issue with several inconsistencies in this film. The daughter claims to be this independent woman, yet she chooses an ultra-traditional wedding complete with the hideous wad of lace called her wedding gown? Also, in these modern times it is rare for a young adult to live at home until they get married; again, if she is an independent woman, wouldn't she try living with her fiancé before taking the plunge? Other commenters have mentioned that the price of the wedding is absurd, and I agree. George is the only voice of reason when it comes to the cost, however we are expected to laugh at his corny yet more cost-effective visions of his daughter's wedding. It was difficult for me to relate to the problems of these spoiled, entitled rich people.It's a movie, and perhaps shouldn't be over-analyzed, but when movies deal with a subject that many people have experienced, it's hard not to notice these things. It distracted me from enjoying the aspects of the film that were done best; namely, the comedic scenes. The scene at the in-laws' house and the scene in the grocery store are, in my opinion, well-done and hysterically funny.I suppose this movie would be a lot more enjoyable to those who suspend belief don't bother nit-picking its flaws.</fullReview>

She has been in a couple of good movies, but they would have been better had someone else been picked for the part. Steve Martin doesn't add much to the movie either.

		<shortDescription>Why shouldn't the cheap SOB pay for it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of the Spencer/Tracy favorite is generally uneven, shifting from generic sitcom scenario to social satire to broad farce to gag-me sentimentality in the blink of an eye. The thing that strikes me most about it is its overwhelming WASPishness. Shyer, Goodrich, et al. pile on so many examples of affluence that the movie feels like a parody of the rich-white-person-family-comedy subgenre. The camera lingers fetishistically on SUV-stuffed garages, and the screenplay takes pains to point out that the Banks parents both own successful businesses, that their daughter is a talented architecture student working on her Master's at 22, that fiancé Brian McKenzie (whose NAME even sounds like a caricature of a white person) is a globetrotting systems consultant at 26, etc.Unfortunately, there's no wink at the audience, and it becomes clear that this is no parody, but a movie un-self-consciously obsessed with its own materialism. And then the hypocrisies start creeping in: Steve Martin spends the first half hour engaged in expository bragging about his family's material successes; then he's forced to play the little guy envying/sneering at his future in-laws' home and possessions. He complains about the excessive cost of the wedding plans, but the screenplay's made it clear many times that the Bankses are rich rich rich and proud of it. So why shouldn't the cheap SOB pay for it? It's only money, don't you know. And then the movie has the gall to mock the pretensions of wedding coordinator Franck, forgetting that its `down-to-earth' characters all pronounce `Copenhagen' to rhyme with `toboggan,' sneer at the idea of wearing a non-designer tux to a wedding, etc.The cast is variable. Steve Martin goes through the motions like a sport, but the overall effect was to make me sadly nostalgic for `All of Me.' His spoiled daughter and her poor-man's-Knox-Overstreet-looking fiancé are obnoxious throughout. Diane Keaton, a miscellaneous Culkin child, and B. D. Wong are all good (in thankless parts). And God help me, in this movie Martin Short finally found a suitable venue for his brand of comedy. His Franck was obviously intended to steal the show, and he does--even if he seems to come from a different comedic universe than the rest of the movie.Overall, Short's performance provides a couple of laughs that almost make up for the movie's snobbery and lack of focus. Almost. 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Short and sweet? Steve Martin was great on SLN and that's where his strength is. In the TV comedy sketch format. However, watching him attempt "funny" for two and a half hours is more than I can stand. Naturally, bad writing has a lot to do with it to. A performer is only as good as the lines he/she is handed. Personally, I think his talent is wasted on these long winded "sophistcated" comedies. He's actually more capable at the one liner and fast paced type situation. This happens to all comedians, historically. In the old days, people like Chaplin and Keaton thought that since they were so funny doing 15 minute shorts, how much more funnier they would be doing an hour long film. In their cases, however, because of their utter greatness, they were much more likely to be able to pull it off, but not all the time. Today's comedians like Martin tend to think the same way, i.e. "If I'm funny on a sitcom or 2 minute sketch, how much more funnier I'll be with a whole film built around me." Not true. They should stick to what they do best and leave the "pathos" and "dramatis" for someone else. Pass on this one. BTW, Watch the original with Spencer Tracey. No comparison.</fullReview>
