		<shortDescription>This Movie Is About UXORICIDE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's what the poster ads warned! UXORICIDE! (look it up). William Castle's "I Saw What You Did" is a great little suspense drama, with a perky cast and an intriguing story. Left alone one night while their parents are out of town, teen-aged Libby, her little sister Tess, and Libby's visiting friend Kit amuse themselves by making crank phone calls. They especially enjoy crooning "I saw what you did and I know who you are" to their victims. Unfortunately, one of their calls hits the bullseye--a homicidal maniac who has just murdered his wife. Tense and atmospheric, with delightful performances from Andi Garrett, Sarah Lane and Sharyl Locke as the kids, and strong ones from John Ireland as the psychopath, and the one-and-only Joan Crawford (straight from Castle's "Strait-Jacket") as his blackmail-minded neighbor, who's inexplicably in love with him. Though her part is a supporting one, just try to look away when she's on screen. A word, too, for the beautiful photography-no mean achievement in a low-budget film. Anchor Bay Entertainment released the movie on DVD and VHS back in 1999. The picture quality is sensational. Also included are two fun '' Teaser Trailers'' -one featuring Castle himself. Though the DVD is not ''anmorphic'' it is in Widescreen with no scratches or blemishes anywhere.It must have been taken from the original Universal negative.The one-channel soundtrack is equally strong, though a good DVD system will allow you to upgrade to two-channel,''Simulated Stereo'' which sounds even better. The Trailers are as well preserved as the film itself. Sadly, it's long out of print, and goes for big $$ on Amazon and EBAY. The 1988 Television remake is terrible. Avoid it and stick with the original!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good for what it is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...which is a no-budget thriller.Two teenage girls (Sara Lane, Andi Garrett) make prank phone calls saying the title line. By mistake they call Steve Marak (John Ireland) who's just killed his wife. Then things get out of control.One of William Castle's low budget horror films that he churned out in the 1960s. None of them are that good but this is definitely one of the better ones. It's photographed in moody black &amp; white and director Castle makes excellent use of darkness (notice all the darkness above the girls when they make the calls) and shadows and fog (which inexplicably shows up at the end). There's also a very vicious shower stabbing in the first 20 minutes with shots obviously imitating "Psycho". There are also quite a few good moments calculated to make you jump.On the debit side--there's not enough story even for 83 minutes; Joan Crawford (dressed to the 9s for no reason) is wasted as a next-door neighbor; Ireland is stone-faced throughout; Lane and Garrett are horrible actresses (and, tellingly, never made another movie) and the script has lines that no teenager would utter.Still, there are worse ways to kill 90 minutes and the jolts in this film do work. Worth seeing if you're a horror fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a hugely entertaining movie, with some TRUE moments of suspense. I thought that Joan Crawford, as usual, gave a magnificent performance. My only regret was that she had a supporting role and therefore had limited screen time. Now that this has finally been released on video for the first time, it should provide Joan's fans with countless hours of entertainment. Joan proves once again, that she is beautiful at any age...in this flick, she was 57 and gorgeous!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and she knows who you are!This is another strange William Castle concoction that features Joan Crawford in one of the B-horror movies she made near the end of her career, and yet the only way they could fit her into this story was to make her a kooky neighbor lady who wears tacky jewelry that looks like some sort of bizarre Aztec armor. Everyone knows the plot, which involves two teenage girls who spend an evening making prank phone calls and, through the miracle of plot contrivance, stumble into the path of a psychotic man who has just committed murder. I don't know if any of the other viewers felt the same way, but I really think the movie's violence is a bit shocking for its day. The first murder is an ironic ripoff of "Psycho", with the person in the shower committing the murder instead of being slashed, and I was surprised at how graphic it really is. Also, I don't know whether this was really the filmmakers' intention or not, but they have captured the excitement of a teenage adventure and carried it effortlessly into a suspenseful conclusion. Ironically, the only thing in the movie that feels wrong is the subplot involving Crawford. It was obviously inserted to give the movie a star and to pad out the running time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic B-Movie Teens In Trouble Flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(POSSIBLE SPOILER)This is a classic b-movie from 1965.The B&amp;W cinematography is beautiful and effective - mucho fog and fake scares but the basic premise - that of kids making prank calls and it coming back to terrify them is truly effective. I saw this when I was quite little and it scared the heck out of me. In fact, this and Snow White are two of my earliest film memories (and Joan Crawford is STILL creepier than the Evil Queen in Snow White). Joan actually has fun as a nasty, scene-stealer neighbor who wants the married man for herself. William Castle (I'm a big fan of his) made many effective, cheapo thrillers: Dr. Sardonicus, Homicidal &amp; Thirteen Ghosts (to name a few). In fact, John Goodamn does a nice job playing a version of Castle in the underrated Joe Dante film, Matinée. But check out this little teenage scarefest and whatever you do - don't prank call someone right after they've killed a mate - they're not in the mood!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good idea for a story handled in a purely pedestrian manner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a William Castle film and has all the earmarks of a made for the drive-in movie--crappy teen music, teen actors and lots of violence (for its day). However, despite this it's still a pretty good film with some occasionally chilling moments. The best aspects of the film are the excellent realistic performance by John Ireland as a menacing murderer, Joan Crawford's decent performance in which she is murdered before she gets a chance to over-act, and the creepy conclusion where the girls are chased about the property by the madman--all really good stuff. But, in between the beginning and the end, the movie drags a bit--and some of it is due to the fact that the two teenagers who star in the film just don't have enough magnetism to sustain the film. Plus, although I hate to admit it, they were both such brats I was kind of hoping they WOULD be killed! The other low-point of the film is the crappy beach party-type music at the beginning and end. It was totally inappropriate for the mood of the film but I assume it was used to appeal to the younger audience--while probably alienating older viewers or people in the 21st century that view the DVD. Not a bad little film, but hardly great or memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, good old William Castle is on the loose again, with a low budget and a creepy plot...and Joan Crawford, whose salary probably used up most of Castle's available cash.You know you're in trouble from the first few scenes, with corny eyeball-shaped framing devices, then the intrusion of Van Alexander's completely out-of-place bouncy score, with its recurring principal theme of "Ninny nanny noo-noo." (Most of his credits are for 60s sitcoms, and it shows.) Then we're treated to exteriors of the Mannering house which are nothing more than Thomas Kincade- style paintings. (Virtually the whole film was shot on a sound stage, except for some rear projections.)The plot itself is clichéd, but decently "executed." The casting is a problem, with Joan Crawford at age 60 trying to be the hypotenuse in a love triangle between 50-year-old John Ireland and some young bimbo (or we should say, ex-bimbo). Not much choice there. The two teenage girls are straight out of 60s sitcom land, and the younger sister joins the ranks of "most annoying child actors." There are some tense moments, including a ripoff of the shower scene from "Psycho" (except with a naked man instead of Janet Leigh).And since we're already knee-deep in 60s sitcoms with the trite score and giggly teenaged actors, we're given an ending that would have been right in place on Dobie Gillis or the Patty Duke Show. Except with a dead body.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When terror calls, it shows up on the Caller ID.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do you say when terror calls? Just the average "hello," or something more terrified?I'm sorry to say Joan does seem a bit stewed. She acts like a marvelous actress on a binge caught unawares. Her part is miniscule, but she gives it her off-kilter all. John Ireland is here, 10 years after being stung by Joan in "Queen Bee," which everyone has already mentioned. That film was infinitely scarier than this one, with Joan stopping just short of eating babies. Ooh, she was a bad one. In this film she's a bad one of a different sort--bad as in "not good."Kit and Libby are the two silly acting teenagers that decide prank phone calls are a lovely way to spend an evening. They have several routines, but I don't remember hearing, "Is your refrigerator running?" "Yes." "Then you better go catch it." I guess they decided against using the classics. They go from mocking people ("Is this John Hamburger?") to girlfriend-accidentally-calls-wife skits ("Is --insert name-- there? Oh, this is his wife?!?"). When their creativity runs out (after about two phone calls) they decide to use a planned line--"I saw what you did and I know you are." Well, William Castle asks, what if the person you called actually did something and he thinks you saw him? Interesting idea--presumably taken from the book on which this film is based. Turns out, they ring up John Ireland, who has just committed a felony, and he thinks he had witnesses. Libby is the one that falls for him, I think, and she just gets all hot and bothered. She decides that she has to see a man that has a sexy voice like that, why, he must be just divine. She really fell hard--I felt sorry for her. She said his voice was something like him running his fingers up and down her spine. What has this girl been reading? She gets so frustrated (Freud's type of frustrated, I imagine) that she goes over to his house just to peek in the window. She gets all dressed up to do this, does her hair and puts on makeup, and the other girl (Kit?) is understandably confused. Libby is stomping on the flowers when she meets Amy, the drunken, sex-crazed, incredibly angry and pathetic neighbor.At this point, things pick up considerably. We've got the rantin' and ravin' of Joan, the stammering and completely terrified girl, and John "Sexy Voice" Ireland. All our characters have reported for duty, and the plot has emerged. Everything is ready to go. I think this is where the film reaches its own little pinnacle of greatness. Joan confronts John (didja know there was also a John Crawford back then?) with the a bunch of incorrect information, but it's just enough to get him riled. From this point on, everyone's in trouble and who can save them now?All in all, a very enjoyable film, although I don't think it's too terribly frightening. (Joan's hair is scary, as I think someone else mentioned, but that's about it.) It's what one would expect from William Castle. Laughs in a Halloween costume.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kids left alone in the house inadvertently play a phone prank on psychopath John Ireland, who has just murdered his trampy Mrs. in the shower! Whenever you see a biography of Joan Crawford's career, this title usually gets left out. True, she has a minor role in it (playing Ireland's neighbor, hoping to blackmail him into marriage), however it's one of the better movies she was involved in after "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" William Castle did a good job as producer/director of this story, and the two teenage girls are very appealing and natural. The movie builds some credible suspense (underlined with a jokey tone) and has interesting visual tricks and groovy music. Avoid the awful, too-literal 1988 TV-remake. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's the plot: A teenage girl with her friend and younger sister(Andi Garett, Sara Lane, and Sharyl Locke) are left home alone one night by their parents, after the babysitter cancels. To amuse themselves, the decide to make prank phone calls(this was in 1965, long before caller ID or tracing existed) one phrase they use quite often to the people they call is "I saw what you did...and I know who you are." What they don't know is that one of the people they call, Steve Marek (John Ireland) takes them seriously, having just stabbed his wife to death!This film was really scary or at least very suspenseful, considering the time period. I was pretty much on the edge of my seat, waiting to see what would happen next. There are a few things that bring this film down, chief among them most inappropriate score I think I've ever heard. It was just corny. The acting in the initial scene between the two teen girls is bad, but gets better. This film comes highly recommended. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this as a young girl and it really scared me then, I watched it again recently as an adult and it still has some suspenseful moments. You all know the story, 2 teenage girls spending the night without parental supervision decide to make prank phone calls, and damn the luck, they accidentally prank a murderer. Of course it gets really scary and dumb after that. In real life what teenager would actually try and meet the person they prank phone called? And then there's the aging, drunken Joan Crawford in a small but memorable role as a sex crazed neighbor. The plot is pretty weak, but overall it's a fun movie to watch on a rainy Saturday night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense, but Fun Suspenser</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my favorite of William Castle's 60s shockers. This one came after his more gimmicky offerings like "Homicidal" and "Mr. Sardonicus", but it still has Joan Crawford thrown in for good measure. Her scene where she tells one of the teenage girls to "get atta heer!" is classic camp at it's highest level.The two teenage leads are passable. I don't think they did any other mainstream features after this one. Patricia Breslin and Leif Erickson (who had each appeared in earlier Castle efforts) are not bad. John Ireland really is creepy and good as the stalking killer. His scene where he stabs his wife in the shower (though inspired by "Psycho", no doubt) is quite effective. The little girl, Tess, is a nuisance.Some really good creepy moments throughout, and one can't deny the fun of the subject matter: Two teenagers getting the wits scared out of them, after making prank phone calls. The music by Van Alexander makes this seem like a 60s sitcom, so in that respect it doesn't really set the mood, but it's not a total disturbance. Definitely one of the better Castle films. Forget the remake. See it on a 'double-bill' with "Strait-Jacket".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Castle...with meaning?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of this movie is one of its strongest points. Two teenage girls making a series of prank calls that they 'saw what you did' until by chance they call someone who actually has killed someone. Unlike the other Castle movies I've seen, this one actually has subtext. The girls' blossoming sexuality becomes the main reason for their problems as they (one in particular) are keen to rid themselves of teenage sexual frustration. Joan Crawford has a small role (but star billing, thank you very much) and, as has already been noted, does seem to be quite drunk in her scenes. Unfortunately, she also has about two feet of piled up grey hair that certainly wasn't her best look. She's convincing enough as an aging woman desperate to keep her man. Enjoyable enough for what it is, and recommended to anyone who liked 'Strait-Jacket' and the like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good idea given mediocre treatment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1965 offering, directed by the famed horror/schlock director William Castle, on one level, is quite fascinating. The idea of two teens making creepy prank calls to unsuspecting victims is rife with possibilities. The film starts out with our two heroines paging through a phone book. A food stain lands on the name of their next victim, a middle aged man named Steve Marak. The prank call begins with their standard line, "I saw what you did, and I know who you are". This time there's a switch-you see, Marak has just finished murdering his wife in a particularly brutal fashion. Needless to say, he doesn't see this message as a harmless prank. He demands to see them, thinking he can either shut them up permanently or bribe them to stay silent. The girls, intrigued by his sexy voice, sneak off in their parent's car to see him. After a good start, the film begins to show its flaws. Joan Crawford, top billed as Steve's girlfriend, is actually on screen only a few minutes. The only really big name in the cast, she chomps up the scenery mercilessly, all the while wearing some ridiculous piece of jewelry which distracts us from just about everything except for her ridiculous performance. The two little pranksters are played by virtual unknowns, who remained unknown thereafter for no unknown reasons. The acting honors here go to John Ireland as Steve. As the wife killer and victim of the girl's tricks, his is the only believable performance in the film. This is unfortunate, for better acting could have made a real difference for the interest and tone of the film. Overall, a better cast (excepting Ireland) and a much better script could have lifted this from just another routine horror melodrama to a fascinating study of voyeurism, and the role this plays in these young girls' lives. The prank call angle is the most interesting angle in what is otherwise a routine melodrama centering on infidelity and murder. Five out of ten (for some good atmosphere, an interesting idea, and Ireland's performance).</fullReview>

They have the incredibly bad luck of calling a man who has just murdered his wife and telling him, "I saw what you did, and I know who you are!" Thinking they are serious, the killer decides to find them and do them in. Also involved in all of this is the killers amorous neighbor, played by Joan Crawford, who sticks her nose into her neighbors business one too many times.What a great idea gone to crap. The photography is flat, the acting is beyond weak, the score was from a 1960's sitcom, and the 'thrills' are non-existent. This movie has such a foolproof concept, but the writing is contrived and convenient. I try to see a silver lining in most bad movies, especially one that features Crawford, but there's no hope for this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When phone pranks go very, very wrong.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fairly well made and entertaining William Castle shocker stars Andi Garrett and Sara Lane as Libby and Kit, two teenage girls who hang out at Libby's isolated country home when Libby's parents go on an overnight trip. Kids being kids, their idea of entertainment is picking random names out of the phone book and pestering the people with prank calls. Their worst mistake is when they dial up Steve Marak (John Ireland), and utter the memorable lines, "I saw what you did, and I know who you are." As fate would have it, Marak has just murdered his wife! While Marak spends his time covering up his crime, fending off the advances of his oversexed neighbour Amy Nelson (Joan Crawford), and desperately trying to get back in touch with the so-called "witnesses", the girls buy themselves more trouble by casing Steve's joint.This isn't as enjoyable overall as this viewer would have liked. Castle isn't able to derive *that* much tension from the set-up, and the phone hijinks go on for a little too long. He also tries to balance a playful approach in the scenes with the girls with a more serious tone in the scenes with Ireland. The music score by Van Alexander is no help; sometimes it's just too jaunty.Fortunately, the scenario gets more gripping as it plays out, and Castle finally delivers a decent suspense finale at the Mannering family homestead. Another major asset is extremely stark and atmospheric black &amp; white cinematography by Joseph F. Biroc. The performances are solid from all concerned. Garrett and Lane create two reasonably engaging and upbeat characters. Ireland is fun as a stone cold psycho, and Crawford is effective as the woman who yearns to be with him. Leif Erickson, Patricia Breslin, John Archer, John Crawford, and Tom Hatten comprise the supporting cast, with Joyce Meadows contributing a brief cameo as the murder victim. The actual scene of her being killed is an obvious "Psycho" riff, but amusing.Worth a look for thriller fans.Remade for TV in 1988.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Saw What You Did is directed by William Castle and written by William P. McGivern. It stars John Ireland, Joan Crawford, Leif Erickson, Andi Garrett, Sara Lane and Sharyl Locke. Music is by Van Alexander (Joseph Gershenson supervising) and cinematography by Joseph F. Biroc. When two teenagers on babysitting duties decide to have fun making prank phone calls, their evening turns sinister when they call up a man who has just murdered his wife? William Castle was of course better known for his gimmicks than for his ability as a film maker, I Saw What You Did shows the best and worst of the great entertainer. Castle produces and directs this one so is accountable for getting the mix completely wrong. At times the picture is genuinely suspenseful, the premise at the core superb, but at others it feels like it wants to be a comedy, further compounded by Alexander's awful musical score. It's a score that belongs in something like Bewitched or The Munsters, and quite often takes you out of the thriller zone. Castle unsurprisingly borrows off of some films that influenced his career, but aided by McGivern's screenplay he manages to put some different spins on the twisty plot developments. It also helps having Biroc (The Killer that Stalked New York/Cry Danger/The Garment Jungle) on photography duty, he's able to make Castle's fog scenes appear icy cold, to blend the shadows into the story like foreboding prowlers. Cast wise the elder cast members aren't stretching themselves here, with Crawford working for food and Ireland on auto-pilot, but the younger actors are great fun and really nail that naivety of youth thing to the max. All told it's a fun film, if not always for the right reasons. With some Castle invention (eyelet vision?!) and steals ? and Biroc on form, there's more than enough here to compensate for the confusing mix of genres. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do enjoy films made in the 50's and 60's. Usually, they have a charm that has been all but lost in today's foul-mouthed bathroom-oriented films.Having said that, I would like to point out that ISWYD is a minor film with limited entertaining value. The story is very contrived, the teens in the film are a little annoying and the music score has absolutely nothing to do with the scenes. It is funny because the music score transforms scenes that should be suspenseful or scary into something that sounds like a Disney's film.There is a couple of murders in ISWYD, and the first one happens in such an idiotic way that I had to watch it a few time to understand what was going on And, by the ways, Joan Crawford is wasted here.Well, there is nothing much here, unless you are feeling nostalgic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Castle seems likely to be remembered more for his showmanship and ability to make very modest movies into "gotta see" events by devising advertising campaigns that while bizarre bordered on a kind of genius--like wiring up seats to give electric shocks ( The Tingler )or the "emergo" process that saw skeletons dangling over the heads of the audience in The House on Haunted Hill .I Saw What You Did eschews such gimmickry and is a perfectly acceptable and eminently enjoyable B movie that passes the time in an agreeable and satisfying mannerTwo teenage girls take advantage of parental absence to indulge in a series of telephone pranks including ringing people chosen at random from the Directory and saying "I SAW WHAT YOU DID AND I KNOW WHO YOU ARE " This backfires when one man they contact -Steve Marek (John Ireland )turns out to have a genuine secret -he has just murdered his wife and disposed of her remains in the nearby woods.He sets out to locate and silence the women ;this is not his only problem as his neighbour the wealthy and possessive Amy Nelson (Joan Crawford )is also clued in to the murder and seeks to blackmail him into marriage. The script by veteran pulp author William P McGivern is solid and Castle directs efficiently-although the shower scene murder cannot help but pale into hack work when set alongside the similar scene in Psycho.Crawford is over the top and was reportedly drunk for much of her performance ,and the weak performances of the teenage leads are a drag on proceedings ,leaving John Ireland to take the acting honours.Its proficient and well made and thriller fans should try it--I suspect they will enjoy this crisp little tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best by Castle, but still has his touch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of you may remember the remake of this one from the late 80's. I'm not too fond of the remake, OR of Shawnee Smith, but i also thought the original would be better. After all, being a huge William Castle fan, i haven't come across a movie yet that didn't leave my jaw dropped. It's too bad what with the premise behind "I Saw What You Did" that it didn't come out as good as it could have been. The movie itself isn't the best example of what Castle was, the music....is awful. As like my big problem with Scream 2(besides it's Scooby-Doo like ending),the music in "I Saw What You Did" seems to be too out of sorts. It's very up tempo and jazzy but doesn't help to create any thrill or excitement. It's disappointing because this one has SO MUCH potential to scare prank-crazy kids out of their wits. The music REALLY destroys any kind of scare and ends up making it feel like cheap exploitation. The perk to this film is the end clincher, as Castle seems to be great at, it isn't exactly jaw-dropping...but i guarantee you won't say "I SAW THAT COMING".....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An evening of prank phone calls turns deadly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I became aware that this movie is now available on DVD thanks to the IMDB...thanks folks! I've been looking for years to find a copy! I take it the reason this has not been seen on TV in a long time is, they mention actual phone numbers, something which was replaced with the 555-xxxx phone numbers in the '70's. Apparently someone figured pranksters would start dialing the numbers used in the story...This is a good suspense thriller very much like other films of the '60's and later the made-for-TV '70's fare. It is enjoyable on its own terms, as are most of William Castle's movies.What makes it stand out, historically, is that children who saw this film in the theater or on TV became EXTREMELY unlikely to make prank phone calls! Talk to someone who saw the movie in the '60'...they will tell you that they NEVER made Bart Simpson-type calls because this movie warned them off! In a way, that makes the movie a part of American culture in a bigger way than many big-budget flicks from the same era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing tepid film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Saw What You Did is an odd mix of different styles. It starts out lighthearted and slightly goofy with 2 girls making plans to meet up for the evening. It alternates between melodrama, horror and silliness not sure what direction to go or unsure of what it wants to be. Does it want to be super scary? There are scenes that are very creepy and that hold your attention. Or does it want to be a harmless, made-for-TV tepid drama? Much of it seems this way. Or is it a murder mystery? That never really comes to fruition. It can be exasperating for sure. Just when it get's going it loses steam and leaves one frustrated. Joan Crawford displays her controlling, overbearing self in this. It's odd to see her behave this way after all the stories about her. Here she is drinking and trying to control her man. I wish I could say very positive things about this but it's disappointing. It could have been much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light thrills, hefty suspense, and... UXORICIDE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Saw What You Did" has teenagers Libby and Kit spending a night home alone along with Libby's younger sister, Tess. What do three young girls do for fun on a Friday night in 1965? Make prank phone calls, of course! But Libby and Kit's idea of innocent fun turns dangerous when they ring a psychopath who has just murdered his wife.I admittedly am not a fan of William Castle's earliest work (as much as I don't want to say it, I find his earlier ghost films "House on Haunted Hill" and "13 Ghosts" remarkably dull), but here Castle seems to have struck my fancy. "I Saw What You Did" is a straightforward suspense film that relies on crafty writing in order to really hold our attention, but the script pulls it off. The causal reactions that put Libby and Kit into such grave danger are extremely clever, and that is perhaps the film's greatest strength? the writing is inventive and smart. In terms of action, there is not a lot that happens over the course of the film, but it still manages to engage all the same, and running at 82 minutes, it packs its punch well.The film's black-and-white photography is gorgeous and drenches everything atmosphere, and its famous "uxoricide" scene cribs Hitchcock's "Psycho" but is arguably more brutal; it marks a pivotal point in the film as well that will have the audience shifting in their seat? even the film's hokey score is discredited by that scene alone. As lightweight as the film feels for much of its duration, the first murder is there to remind us that it's really not.The two leading young girls are remarkably likable in their roles, and Joan Crawford infamously pulls off the role of the psychopath's sultry mistress next-door. While Crawford is often credited for hamming things up in her later career, I found her performance here to be actually quite incredible and terrifying; her interrogation of Libby when the girls arrive at the madman's house was absolutely hair-raising? in fact, I'd go so far as to say she's scarier in that moment than John Ireland is throughout the entire film.Overall, "I Saw What You Did" is noteworthy as a thriller, but also as a cultural relic of a bygone era of rotary dials, and a world where prank calls could lead to murderous madmen peeking in your windows. It's a clever and suspenseful film that is tame by today's standards, but the maliciousness of its first murder scene does keep it floating above total kitsch. It's fun, short, and sweet, and Joan Crawford somehow manages to be at her scariest in a role that could have easily been very boring in the hands of another actress. It's a shame that it hasn't been re-released on DVD or Blu-ray for new generations to have availability to; the original Anchor Bay disc went out of print years ago and is inexplicably among the rarest horror DVDs out there. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Saw What You Did... And I Know Who You Are!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Things get dicey for two teenage girls after they play what was supposed to be a harmless prank in 'I Saw What You Did'. Kit and Libby are spending the night babysitting Libby's younger sister Tess at their deserted mansion on a farm. The three of them decide to play prank phone calls on random people. It's all fun at first, until they decide to call Steve Marak and say the line "I saw what you did, and I know who you are!". What they don't know is that Steve just murdered his wife! So of course when Steve hears this over the phone, he suspects that the caller is onto him. This begins a fun game of cat and mouse in which Steve must deal with his nagging lover Amy (Joan Crawford), and get to the mysterious caller in order to shut her up... not knowing the caller is simply a teenage girl playing a game. I really love this film, one of my favourite's by William Castle. It runs at a bit of a slower pace than my all time favourite Castle movie (Strait Jacket), but has enough going for it to keep my attention. I'd say a con to this was that Joan Crawford was not utilized enough, but her character Amy was really secondary to the movie - and it worked. Amy was a supporting character, and although Crawford put in a good performance, 'I Saw What You Did' is more about the teenagers and the psychotic murderer out to keep them quiet.'I Saw What you Did' was likely the first horror movie to introduce the "helpless babysitter versus killer" storyline, which of course 'Halloween' used brilliantly in '78. The overall acting was good, especially from the main characters Libby, Kit and little Tess! You feel for all three of them and worry for their safety against Steve. Only con to it is that the ending felt a bit rushed. I highly recommend this one if you can find it, it's pretty hard to get on DVD or even VHS.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Innocent pranks, innocent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With minor flaws and plenty of innocence, the suspense "I Saw What You Did" goes with a simple premise that even today can make you completely hooked in it. It might not scare but it can give some good laughs, and even some small thrills. The actors charisma, specially the young female actresses and the simplicity of its story make of this film something purely enjoyable. The villain of this story is the telephone used by two teenage girls who, out of their relative boredom and enjoying the fact that her parents are not at home, use it to make pranks on many people, at first with some childish jokes or inventing stories, to later evolve into saying the terrifying phrase "I saw what you did and I know who you are". In one of those calls they perfectly hit someone who has reasons to hide his actions: a psychotic (John Ireland) who just happened to kill his wife. Of course the girls don't know that but their curiosity impels them to find the mysterious voice on the other side of the line. Terror awaits around the corner! Such a innocent and almost harmless movie that even a kid could watch this with no problem (except, maybe, for the obvious reference of "Psycho" with a similar murder in the shower). What concerns William Castle isn't much in creating a frightening horror film but it's more about showing the dangers behind child pranks, warning them about the risks they take when they use a telephone. If made today internet would be the villain and the prank wouldn't be so silly. Why you should watch this? Well, it's fun, completely uncompromising, the kids Andi Garrett, Sarah Lane and Sharyl Locke are quite adorable, and they know to make you interested in the story, responding for the several well humored moments of the movie, and also the great presence of Joan Crawford as the psycho's lover. It has its flaws - the barking dog, for example, in the climatic scenes - but it's certainly entertaining. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Saw What You Didn't Do...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Saw What You Did opens with an eye-hole 'peep' matte shot (keyhole effect in full play) which also links the two main characters (teenage girls) as they get into a phone conversation preparing for a sleepover. This opening shot is both specular and cleverly ironic, which would bode well for this Castle film. Another element playing in Castle's favor is the casting of Joan Crawford. Castle's direction is compellingly and compulsively off and with no perceivable explanation as the script is fresh enough and the characters are fun and dynamic. The shot-reverse-shot and tableau framing creates a sense of camp. There is a splattering of oblique framing aptly creating an unobtrusive camera, however other elements such as the heavy shadows of a uninspired noir lighting setup do not fir with the theme and therefore no stable mood is created and the pace of narrative progression suffers. There is good humor with the crank calling and the shower scene is dramatic and well choreographed. Castle is again ahead of his time (or of the A-picture studio system at least) as he plays around with a psychologically attractive theme that would be replayed in the genre through films such as When a Stranger Calls (1979) and of course Wes Craven's Scream. The film is psychological and carries a significant traditional young female voice in its thematic. There is an idea purveyed that a young woman can take care of herself and stay safe just by talking her way through potential trouble. Castle proved long ago that he has a touch for evoking self-reflexivity within the film text and with the spectator. A good use of a mirror in this film underscores that point. There is an incredibly provocative shot constructed with intuition and style where the child and killer are framed in deep staging (so why the cheesy jewelbox cover). My primary complaint about this film is that Crawford's character needed more involvement in the script and more screen time. . This is a fun film worth watching, but many oversights keep it from being a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another of William Castle's horror films from the 1960's. This one "I saw What you Did" from 1965 is delightful. Castle was known for this low-budget films; however, being fair, this is one of his better entries.Two teen-aged girls (Sara Lane, Andi Garrett) are alone in one of the girl's isolated homes; her parents are out of town. For fun, the two make prank phone calls. They pick random names out of the phone book (males, of course) and say in a breathy voice "I Saw What you Did." Most of the folks on the other end laugh it off. Just their luck, a man who just murdered his wife (John Ireland) takes them literally, although they have randomly picked his name. Brought into the mix of all this is the man's lover (Joan Crawford) who listens in on the extension phone, thinking he's carrying on with another woman! Not knowing who the girl is (this is 1965, long before the days of caller ID, cell phones, or even touch-tone) he is left stewing and scared someone has actually seen him murder his wife. It all gets quite complicated and implausible, with the curious teens driving to the man's home, spying on him from the windows. They are caught by an enraged Crawford snooping around her lover's property (she lives next-door) and, in a hilarious scene, she calls the teen girl a tramp and forces her back into her car. The film does turn deadly serious when the murderer finds out where the girls live, with an ending that is quite suspenseful. First, a bit about the cinematography; it is quite good, using the most of the darkness and creepiness that surrounds the isolated house. A word about the performances: the two teen girls are delightfully bad actresses, but we don't care because they are fun to watch. John Ireland is quite good, but stone-faced and lethal throughout. Crawford is dressed to the nines, in formal evening attire and a huge necklace that looks like it could have been worn by Cleopatra! She is oddly so in love with Ireland, that she tries to blackmail him into marrying her. It's all a hoot and a holler, but there are some genuine moments of suspense. Worth checking out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night on TCM while I was channel surfing. Well, this movie is okay, but it's certainly no Psycho or Carrie. And yes, this movie has Joan Crawford in it. The plot is about a couple of teens who did nothing but make prank calls to a guy who just killed his wife and his lover. Little did these teens know that they'll be fighting for their lives once this soon-to-be Jack the Ripper hunts them down. The acting is fine, the characters are good, the music is nice, and the special effects are... well, okay. I'm not saying this is a bad movie, but I think there should be more effort put into this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Castle made a career out of monster and ghost stories, so even though the synopsis on my TV said this was a departure about teenage girls involved with murder I still expected the same kind of B-movie action. In truth though it was actually a pretty decent thriller.A sixteen year old girl and her little sister who live in a secluded home a few miles away from anybody get the house to themselves for a night. The older girl invites her friend over for dinner and the three of them eventually resort to prank calling random people from the phone book to entertain themselves. Unfortunately for them they make the mistake of calling a man who's just committed murder and jokingly tell him, "I know what you did, and I know who you are." The man naturally assumes the voice on the line is serious and there is a witness out there who saw him disposing of his girlfriend's body. A variety of twists and intertwining characters eventually put the guilty man in the same room as our innocent kids.The plot relies heavily on coincidence to stitch everything together and a major plot point hinges on an extremely stupid decision by our protagonists but in spite of it all, it still manages to build a lot of tension towards it's climax which although brief is handled very effectively. It also helps that this secluded home of there's is surrounded by forestry and continually deepening shadows as the night wares on with fog that's barely visible outside the moonlight, making for a very creepy and cool atmosphere. The acting is pretty good too, even our teenage heroes seem to exercise some decent chops all things considered. Good fun and good thrills.</fullReview>

This stupid teen also decides that she needs to see this guy up close(guess she is horny) .stupid ,so she drags her friend and younger sister along to his house,great idea NOT . Gets out of the car and snoops around ,just as he is about to stab her, crawford shows up and chews her out. Then Crawford makes her go home but not before grabbing the registration to the car which is conveniently hooked to the dash ,confront Ireland about it and gives it to him. She blackmails him as she knows everything so he kills her and goes after the girl who made the calls. The music is somewhat annoying as it plays this Leave It to Beaver type sarcasm when the girls are on screen even when they are in danger. I'm actually glad that Crawfords skanky slut character gets the knife so to speak. Far too old to play Irelnds love interest yet she gets star billing for all of 10 minutes screen time. The ending is predictable but also alarming since the naivety of the baby sister might be all too real. Average at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I saw what you did in 1965, but I don't care anymore.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time 1965 rolled around, William Castle was pretty much out of ideas and gimmicks. "I Saw What You Did" was nearly Castle's last movie and it shows. The only two gimmicks left to the old carny was the warning on the poster for this snoozer: "This picture is about UXORCIDE!!". This is an obscure term for the murder of one's wife. Castle was out of ideas by now, no skeletons on a wire, no punishment poll, no ghost viewers. Only a forgotten term for murder...and Joan Crawford.ISWYD is a movie trapped in it's own time bubble, a look at the hijinks of teenage girls left alone with a telephone for fun and games. Once, telephones only made calls in or out, nothing more. Phone pranks have pretty much gone the way of high-button shoes and horse-drawn carriages. This look back at girls in 1965 is sweet, as well as irritating. Home-alone teens Libby and Kit amuse themselves by making dozens of stupid prank calls, along with prepubescent Tess, Libby's beyond annoying little sister. Using the tag line "I saw what you did and I know who you are" finally hits the jackpot when the two gals inadvertently reach a man who's just murdered his wife. Serious tomfoolery continues until the murderer reaches the girls (don't ask how, it's ludicrous) and lessons are learned.ISWYD is obviously dated and claustrophobic, being filmed entirely on sound stages at Universal. It has the cheap look and feel of a bad TV sitcom. The "outdoor" sets are painfully fake, and one wonders when Mr. Ed or Herman Munster will pop out of the canned fog. There's also a misplaced super perky soundtrack by the heinous Van Alexander who specialized in terrible TV themes and phony "rock and roll". Don't expect tension when bad transistor radio beach party music underscores the action.Which now leads us to the two very sad things about this moldy oldie: the murder of the wife (UXORCIDE!!!, remember?) and Joan Crawford. William Castle was the first to blatantly copy Psycho (1960) with his cross-dressing maniac in Homicidal (1961). ISWYD again wanders onto Hitchcock's lawn with the second "shower murder" of the 60s. This time, however, Castle stages the murder in reverse, where the victim is pulled into the shower and stabbed to death. Castle was really stretching things here. Now, Joan Crawford. Over 60 by this time, she was obviously finishing her contract work with Castle after the campy "Strait-Jacket". Here, Joan is swamped by an enormous hairdo, all swoops and curls embellishing a beehive of gargantuan proportion. Joan is playing an extremely horny neighbor, who is having an affair with the shower murderer, played by John Ireland. Joan isn't in the movie for long, which is good. She appears to be drunk and unable to cope with the gigantic hairdo or the huge tacky necklace that's strangling her. Watching Joan purr and slink around Ireland is about as sexy as watching your grandma get her groove on. We are happy when Joan is killed and her hair deflates. Ireland just looks coarse, nervous, and wondering where his check is. ISWYD is frozen in cheap movie studio set Hell, and isn't worth revisiting unless you want your pleasant memory of this potboiler ruined. The available DVD is pretty pricey for a bare bones presentation if you seek it out. The only thing that could have saved this would have been Mr.Ed rescuing the two silly girls from John Ireland. Ring ring! Wilbur,it's for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why all murderers should have Caller ID</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another camp Castle classic, "I Saw What You Did" presents an amazingly good premise that gets seriously botched by the usual amount of plot holes and implausibilities these kinds of teen horror flicks are rife with. No sense rehashing the plot; you already know it. But we already know villainous John Ireland is twisted. Why else would he murder his sexy wife (Joyce Meadows) in order to carry on with neighbor, Joan Crawford, who possesses all the feminine allure of a '63 Chevy Suburban? It's always fun to watch Joan in these later films, seen here wearing industrial-strength costume jewelry and a hairdo that would survive a nuclear disaster. She is quite good here, and provides the few real dramatic sparks in the film. Too bad her murder in the second reel is so anti-climactic.The one character we actually want to see murdered is head teen prankster Libby (Andi Garrett), if only because she won't die from her own stupidity!In one "good" scene, neighbor Joan catches a peeping Libby snooping next door at the house of her intended future hubby, Ireland. In a spiteful move, Big Bad Joan rips the vehicle registration card from Libby's car, and inadvertently provides Ireland with the name and address of his next victim. OOPS! Much of the film is oddly scored with peppy beach party-type music which doesn't lend an altogether convincing sense of suspense and dread. The final scene probably sums up the film's ineptitude best. Crying and shaking one moment after almost being strangled to death, Libby and her kid sister Tess then share giggles and laughter while the murderer lies slumped over dead in the car's back seat. Say, who's up for some cocoa!You certainly won't be wondering how many Academy Awards this was nominated for. It's a definite curio and good for lots of unintentional laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Libby Mannering's parents are going out for the night. The regular sitter had to cancel because of illness, so the elder Mannerings figure Libby can take care of herself and her younger sister Tess. Kit Austin, a friend of Libby's, is coming to spend the night with her friend. Libby is into mischief. She loved to make phone crank calls at random, so she proposes a game: how about calling people for kicks. Libby concoct stories as she goes along. Kit has second thoughts, but goes along with her friend.The people that answered the girls first calls took the prank in stride, but not so Steve Marak. When he answers the phone, Libby, pretending to be older and more sophisticated, proceeds to tell the man she saw what he did. Had he been another man, he would have dismissed the statement, but not so Steve, for a reason: he had just killed his wife, who was in the process of leaving him. So Steve's guilt feelings begin to get the best of him since he had figured he had covered his tracks.Added to the suspense is a woman of a certain age, Amy Nelson, a neighbor, who had set her eyes on Steve as a possible romantic partner. Steve, who had no intentions of starting anything with Amy, goes to bury the body of his slain wife. Amy figures there is something more to the man she likes, than really meet the eye. Amy begins spying on Steve to see what really is going on with him.When the girls, on a whim, decide to visit Steve's house, they had no idea as to how deep they had gotten and the mess they had created. Amy, noticing the girls outside Steve's house, figures the young women are up to no good. Amy pushes her luck with the man she wants and does not live long after her would be lover decides to eliminate her. Now Steve must get back to the teenagers to get rid of them.Not having seen the film before, we decided to take a look when it showed up on cable recently. This was a William Castle product, a man that had great success in the horror genre. The director enjoyed a long career in the movies, but he was not lucky in the way he planned to present the film. The premise was good. Of course, it is dated, by today's standards when not many people engage in those pranks, something that is not easily condoned, or justified by present laws that would consider Libby's actions as a kind of harassment, punishable by law. Basically, our main interest in watching was to see Joan Crawford, who is featured in the film, but whose presence is only minor within the context of the narrative. John Ireland does not impress as Steve. The production is made more creepy by the use of a fog that envelops most of the scenes involving the suburban house.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I seen this film on TV late at night. I started viewing during the first scene of prank calls. The 3 main girls were playing them on random people they found in the phone book. There was something about this film that made me keep watching. A lot of old black and white movies are like this, they are interesting enough, just to the point you want to know what happens next. I also remember wanting to see what kids during this time period could come up with that was funny to say on a prank call. There jokes were kind of lame but watching people do this so long ago is pretty amusing anyways. The whole time I was watching the film I thought it was "Dial M for Murder" or "When a Stranger Calls". Since I didn't see either of those films before, I was unknown of their plot so I thought either one could be what I was watching. This film's plot is pretty simple and unrealistic. The girls play the same prank phone call over and over again to different people telling them that they know who they are and saw what they did, until coincidently they call a man who has murdered a woman that same day. He obviously takes the call seriously and must track down these witnesses. I Know it's suppose to be a scary film but I feel even for the standards of the time it's pretty light. It was probably a film made for kids to go to during the Saturday matinée, to get a good scare and also get the message across to not make prank phone calls. However the film is enjoyable and memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hardly the scariest movie, my brother and I watched this one and the remake with Robert and Keith Carradine, Shawnee Smith and Tammy Lauren and were never so amused in our lives. (Later, we would do the same thing with the two 'Five Came Back' movies) Beginning with a shocking, sudden death in a shower, halfway through the movie before a star (Crawford) appears, it was obviously heavily influenced by 'Psycho'. I watch Joan Crawford movies whenever I can now to gain some understanding about 'Mommie Dearest'. I already had the remake on tape and when this one came on, I wanted to see the changes that took place. The performances were non-existent and Crawford's whole reason for being in this film puzzled me to no end. She was a next door neighbor? When she enters for the first time, she has one of those mountainous hairdoes going on and a "necklace" that looked like a chestplate. Hardly Mrs. Kravitz next door looking to borrow a cup of sugar! Unless you want to watch 'Psycho' imitations or just have no idea what to expect or you can even do as I did and watch the "original" and the remake at the same time, this won't be much fun.</fullReview>

Dated, sure, but enjoyable on many levels--not the least of which is a visibly drunk Joan Crawford (in the infamous "ge' ou'a here" scene). The climactic scene is still pretty spooky, though it has been copied to death--not that it was all that original to begin with. I'm making the movie sound worse than it is; it's actually very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen this movie in SEVERAL years because it has not been on TV in quite some time and it is extremely difficult to obtain on video. I do remember watching it when I was younger and being very scared! Since it used to be a big thing for young kids to get on the phone and play silly pranks, this movie would make kids think twice about doing it again! I would love to be able to watch it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Saw What You Did</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The universe of William Castle..a Rockwellian innocence threatened by evil. That's the case in "I Saw What You Did" about three girls who prank call folks, chosen at random from a phone book, unfortunately hand-picking a middle-aged psychopath who likes to stick a knife in women's bellies.Libby(Andi Garrett), her little sister Tess(Sharyl Locke)and school chum Kit(Sara Lane)spend the evening, while their parents are at a small gathering for the night, prank calling various people, when they select the wrong man, Steve Marak(John Ireland)claiming they saw what he did and knew who he was, shortly after he murdered his wife, burying her not too far from his home. Libby, quite a googly-eyed little cutie, really liked Steve's voice, and wishes to see what he looks like which puts her and little Tess in peril. Steve has a neighbor, Amy Nelson(..the one and only Ms Joan Crawford, in a limited role despite top billing)who is obsessively in love with him. She finds out that Steve murdered his wife, and listens in on a phone conversation with Libby who is claiming to be a woman named Suzette. Furious with jealousy, Amy finds Libby prowling Steve's house, and removes her parent's registration card with their address on it from the car. This card will provide Steve with their whereabouts as a frightened Libby, with Kit and Tess in tow, drives away at the angry demands of Amy. Threatening blackmail if he doesn't marry her, Steve "rids" himself of Amy before taking to the road so he can find Suzette, planning to silence the one he believes might know of his bad conduct.While touching on the repercussions of prank phone-calling to kids, Castle has the perfect set-up for a confrontation between a sadistic killer, with an explosive trigger, and innocent children, alone in their house with parents far from home. It's a parent's worst nightmare and Castle preys on his audience with this fear by having worried mother Ellie(Patricia Breslin)constantly calling home and always either getting a busy signal or no answer at all. A master manipulator, Castle even has the police stop by the Mannering home before the killer arrives to find them safe. And, a masterstroke by Castle has the first meeting between Steve and his callers in the Mannering home going well with him even returning their registration card, before a call from Kit(..regarding the news she heard on the radio about Steve's wife's body being found and his exact description detailed)sets in motion the final act as killer pursues those who threaten to expose his guilt. The casting of Ireland is also brilliant because he doesn't look like a psycho at all..in fact he looks like a dad who might have a family, house, and white picket fence. A "Psycho" inspired shower murder where Steve stabs his wife viciously before putting her through the glass door really shows the viewer just what lurks inside this average joe, who doesn't look like he could harm a fly. Crawford plays Amy as a prying, overbearing busybody who walks right into a damning situation, deeply in love with a true menace. I think this will always be looked at as a minor effort in Castle's resume, but I think once he gets to the first startling murder, the film really kicks in gear building to the "there's a killer on the premises" climax where danger awaits the Mannering kids who must somehow evade grave danger. I realize a film like this is very much a product of it's time and will appear hokey and silly to a large majority of horror fans, but I think if one can look at Castle's abilities at applying nasty individuals within such a happy-go-lucky veneer, you might learn to appreciate his cunning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't say exactly what the producers had in mind when this came off the ol' drawing board,but it is an easy to watch series of unintentional sight gags,and funny dialogue that rivals the strangest movies of all times.What does it say about the career of Joan(Pepsi generation)Crawford that she consented to do this movie?I'm guessing her ego had to be supported by hundreds of custom made(wooden)hangers.So after Joan got her $50,000 the remaining budget of $170 went to the sets and supporting cast. This movie shows Joan giving 50K of overacting until one thinks her head will explode.The real comic relief is when she exits, I got the biggest smile of all.

		<shortDescription>and I know who you are!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I saw what you did...and I know who you are!" This is what teenagers Kit and Libby say to Steve Marak (John Ireland), whom they've randomly dialed as a prank. Trouble is, they don't know that Marak's just killed his wife, who was about to leave him, and has buried her in a shallow grave. Now he thinks his mysterious caller knows too much - and he's out to find her.This is another post-gimmick horror movie from the legendary William Castle, and like The Night Walker and Strait-Jacket, there are plenty more genuine scares than campy laughs. This is also the kind of movie that couldn't quite be duplicated in this day and age, of course. The girls find their numbers not by just dialing random digits but by picking names out of the phone book. That's because back then, many numbers weren't even used (even though the full number consisted of a two-letter designation for the town/exchange and then five numbers), so Kit and Libby could have tried a score of phone numbers before getting an answer.But the use of the phone book adds to the story in another way. Kit and Libby think Steve's voice sounds darn hunky, so they decide to snag Libby's mom's car and head to good ol' Steve's house. You know, just to see what he looks like. Late at night. They're not even going to get out of the car! They drag along Libby's kid sister Tess, because they're not going to leave her alone in their secluded forest house! They're responsible! There's a side plot. Steve's a little crazed (even before killing his wife, played by Joyce Meadows), but he's almost stable compared with his neighbor Amy, played by the inimitable Joan Crawford. Amy is obsessed with Steve - it's unclear whether they'd been having an affair, but Amy's intentions are transparent - to the point where, once she realizes what Steve's done, she attempts to blackmail him into marrying her and having a whopping fun life together. It's wacked-out Crawford at her late-career best. This was supposed to be a cameo, but she nails the role so perfectly that she gets extra time for bad behavior.Prank calls, kids. They were a bad idea in 1965, and they're a really bad idea in 2014, when anyone can either tell who is calling them or call them back with that old standby the *69. You know, for those who don't have call-waiting. So you can't pull this malarkey nowadays - too likely that you get some crazed lunatic with no sense of humor.Another fun Castle thriller with some pretty solid work from even the kid actors (Sara Lane, Andi Garrett, Sharyl Locke). The moody fog surrounding the isolated home also sets the perfect tone for an underrated thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I SAW WHAT YOU DID (William Castle, 1965) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my earlier review of William Castle's HOMICIDAL (1961), I had stated that not only was that film obviously patterned on Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO (1960) but also that it looked forward to the "Grand Guignol" cycle that followed in the wake of the critical and box-office success of Robert Aldrich's WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? (1962) which had obviously co-starred Joan Crawford. Well, the film under review (which, incidentally, also features Crawford) is not only the third of four successive 'official' Castle efforts in that vein ? including the bona- fide superior Crawford star vehicle STRAIT-JACKET (1964) ? but also subverts two of PSYCHO's most infamous elements: the nominal star of the film here shows up more than half-way through its running-time but still gets bumped off well before the end; and while there is a (very effective, I might add) shower murder sequence here too, it is the killer who is naked under the faucet and is surprised by his aggressive victim, his departing wife!! Despite all these derivations and influences, I SAW WHAT YOU DID itself got remade for TV in 1988, not to mention inspired the "slasher" mini-franchise I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER more than 30 years later?Unfortunately, for all the atmospherically fog-laden black-and-white lighting and decent star names in the cast list (which, curiously, also includes male actor John Crawford as a providential highway patrolman!), the prototype does not perhaps hold up as well as expected in retrospect. Indeed, despite all three being billed ahead of the title, only psychopathic villain John Ireland gets a meaty role and a considerable amount of screen time; on the other hand, as already mentioned above, Crawford's unflattering part of Ireland's overzealous, overcoiffeured and ultimately blackmailing neighbour is only a star cameo (and her last appearance in a Hollywood feature film to boot!), while Leif Erickson's businessman father is just an unconvincing excuse to get the parents away from home for the night so that the trio of girl protagonists can indulge in the titular prank and resultant danger! Even that joke is played out for far more than it is worth and, like the cutaways to the elders' bland dinner engagement, gets to feel repetitive before long. Thankfully, the actresses chosen to fill in the shoes of the menaced pranksters are an engaging lot?even if Castle's reprise of the upbeat opening music cue (heard over the credits cleverly displayed through opening and shutting eyes!) for the ending was perhaps a bit misjudged seeing how the two sisters had just been threatened by a knife-wielding serial killer! Incidentally, for the typically ingenious ad campaign for the film, Castle proudly proclaimed to cinema patrons that the film they were about to watch involved "uxoricide" and had selected seats strapped with belts intent on keeping viewers from leaping out of them in shock!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Suspense and make sure you pop the popcorn!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah White Castle movies!! Known for their great hamburgers and bad horror flicks! It was such one weekend night---nothing on the Cable TV except this one unknown Joan Crawford flick.---So being a Joanie C fan starring in a movie that I never heard of "I Saw What You Did" I decided what the heck! I'll check it out. Despite my suspicions, I thought it was a not bad suspenseful black and white drive in flick.First, the plot, Libby a average everyday teenager with her little sister spend the weekend alone while Mom and Dad go out of town. Oh! Libby asks a friend to come over to study with. So what do the studious pair of teenagers do when Mom and Dad leave. They put on some records on the phonograph (no CD's---this is a movie from the 50's) grab the junk food and make those stupid prank phone calls to people like the Old ones---"Is your refrigerator running---I just saw it run down the street" Well, as Murphy's Law goes---one of the phone calls made was to a psychopath who just murdered his wife. And telling the psycho husband over the phone "I saw what you did and I know who you are" is NOT a wise idea!! Furthermore...flirting with the nut (who flirts back to the girls because he wants to know who they are) is not a good idea neither. and further bad luck....The psycho has a jealous girlfriend neighbor (Joan Crawford) who witnesses the conversation and thinks he is carrying on more affairs beside her. More bad luck, Libby is intrigued by the flirtatious creep and actually drives over to the house to see what he looks like. Our jealous girlfriend neighbor catches them,chases them off and gets their address information (where it eventually lands in the hands of the psychopath) and NOW the phone has hit the fan!! Joan Crawford's appearance in the film is very slight but the billing is big. The film moves very good for a low budget horror. There are also plenty of scenes that are made to jump out at the audience. I won't reveal what happens next but the suspense will keep you on the edge of your seat and the acting is not that bad. I would advise any dreamy eyed talkative teenager to see the film about the dangers of prank calling and meeting people over the phone or internet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pre Crank Yankers.....Pre When A Stranger Calls....Pre Teens Play.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fun flick I saw as a kid. Never discussed around these parts, and I suspect no one has seen it under the age of 30. Pre-Crank-Yankers, A couple of cute, bored, suburbanite teenage girls play on the telephone, dialing numbers at random for fun. "I Saw What You Did.....And I Know Who You Are.", they whisper into the mouth-piece. And the reaction they receive is usually a hang-up or a chastising. Slumber-Party giggles ensue each time. But eventually (call it a stroke of luck) they would dial the number of a guy who had murdered his wife just hours before. "I Saw What You Did.....And I Know Who You Are." Stunned, the guy holds them on the phone awhile, questioning them. He can't believe that someone had witnessed this when there was no one around to see. And the girls, thrilled that someone actually humors them, provides detailed, accurate information that convinces him that they actually saw him murder his wife. And now he is determined to murder them. I saw this film as a pre-teen (some....30 years ago) but I recently happened across it at a flea-market that has a collection of ancient VHS and Beta tapes that no one (except me) goes anywhere near. And I was delighted to be reunited. This old gem (without a box-cover) was littered amongst the stack. 75 cents each. Great buy for an underrated classic. This film was remade, I recall, but I wasn't interested in seeing it. This is the first movie I'd ever seen where the "telephone" played a major roll in a film. "When A Stranger Calls" was second for me. And I think "I Saw What You Did" was better. I give it an 8/10.</fullReview>

I would love to be able to purchase the movie, but I can't seem to find it for sell.It was a very scary movie to me at that time. Today it might seem sort of cheesy compared to what we have today.

		<fullReview>With parents Leif Erickson and Patricia Breslin (as Dave and Ellie Mannering) out for the evening, thrill-seeking teenaged daughter Andi Garrett (as Libby) invites blonde friend Sarah Lane (as Kit Austin) to sleep over. The girls, plus pushy little sister Sharyl Locke (as Tess), spend time making prank telephone calls. One of their funnier stunts is calling random names from the phone book and telling the answering party, "I saw what you did, and I know who you are!" When they tell this to John Ireland (as Steve Marak), he thinks they know he has just killed his wife...William Castle's "I Saw What You Did" probably provided most theater and drive-in audiences with medium-sided thrills in 1965 - but, today, it's very tame stuff. There is an interesting gender-reversed twist on Hitchcock's "Psycho" (1960) shower scene. The best part of the film is definitely huge-haired Joan Crawford (as Amy Nelson). Every inch the star (although only a supporting player in this story), Ms. Crawford relishes each second before the camera. Her role as the horny, fiftysomething neighbor, who knows how to prepare a stiff drink, is absolutely delicious.****** I Saw What You Did (7/21/65) William Castle ~ John Ireland, Andi Garrett, Joan Crawford, Sarah Lane</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the simple pleasures in my young life was the occasional wheezy, sleep-disrupting asthma flare-ups that would hit late at night. If it happened on a weekday, I might be able to dodge school because of a lack of sleep, but if I woke up with lungs full of goo on the weekend, there might be some sort of a consolation prize on TV, late at night, after the local news, and the Carson rerun from 1967.On one of those weekend nights, with me waiting for my medicine to kick in and the temperature in our non-air conditioned house hovering around 80, I got to see Roger Corman's great little I Saw What You Did and I Know Who You Are! Although I have a blurry memory of Leif Erickson, John Ireland, and a seriously creepy Joan Crawford, I know I thought this 1965 drive-in theatre-grade flick was a cut above.It had a modern look to it, there was a serious level of menace in the story of a couple of teenage girls who call a stranger to inform him he's been caught, not knowing he really did just kill his wife, or somebody.I know I liked it and I've got it in my mail rental queue (now watch--it will be just awful, awful!). It kept me up and scared long past when the nasty-tasting asthma medicine went to work.I remember telling my mom all about it the next morning, and her irritation with me being up half the night and not letting her know made me feel as if I had committed a murder.Nothing like Catholic guilt to suck the fun out of a Roger Corman movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Castle's B thriller is very suspenseful and ideal for dark, late Saturday night viewing. Top-billed Joan Crawford is dressed glamorously throughout, although her character barely makes it half way through the picture. It's also rather obvious that she came directly from "Strait-Jacket", and this would cement her as a camp icon. Of course, you can't help but think, "Mommie Dearest, I promise I'll be good!"Two teenage girls (Andi Garrett and Sarah Lane) bored on a Saturday night, decide to make prank phone calls (oh, those glory days before caller ID!), and use the interpretive phrase, "I saw what you did - and I know who you are!" Be careful how you dial, girls, because macho psychopath John Ireland has just brutally murdered his young wife (while he was taking a shower, no less - "Psycho" parallels, anyone?), and thinks you saw him do the dastardly deed. And, in good old psycho killer fashion, he will do anything to silence any alleged witnesses.Although it's unmistakably el cheapo camp, Castle's gimmicky trademark, it's a nail-biting ride, and when it comes down to it, just a fun scarefest! Don't touch the phone, don't answer the door, don't go off on your own to meet your mystery guy, and don't live out in the middle of nowhere with no place to run!And don't try to steal Joan's man - she'll be ridding your closet of wire hangers!AND STAY AWAY FROM THAT RETARDED 1988 TV REMAKE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though Joan Crawford is the box office name in I Saw What You Did, she comes in after about a third of the film is over and is dispatched before the final third begins. The real stars of the film are teenage girls Sara Lane and Andi Garrett who had brief careers and John Ireland a man they prank and live to regret it.You couldn't make this film today. Two bored and stupid teens who are babysitting the sister of one of them decide to play a game of random phone call. Wouldn't you know it they call up John Ireland who has just done a Janet Leigh on his wife Joyce Meadows in the shower. And what do they say, "I Saw What You Did". Crawford is a next door neighbor who has real evidence of what Ireland did and threatens him with the cops unless he marries her. She's got it bad for Ireland, but blackmail is hardly the basis for a happy marriage no matter how good the sex is. Crawford pays for that dumb play.William Castle directed the film, stylishly to be sure, but the film's premise is a truly dumb one.And with Caller IDs today that film could never be remade.

		<shortDescription>Highly enjoyable popcorn flick from William Castle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Castle was famous for his gimmicks but he also had a penchant for making highly enjoyable thrillers - and while I Saw What You Did is not his best work; it plays to its strengths well and certainly entertains its audience. Almost certainly due to the success of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece Psycho in 1960, this film once again sees Castle handling a theme based around a psychopathic killer (he did it earlier with Homicidal in 1961 and Straight-Jacket in 1964) and takes direct influence from a certain famous scene from the Alfred Hitchcock film. There's also a touch of Hitchcock's Rear Window thrown in too. Clearly the film was intended to appeal to a young crowd as Castle puts the focus on two girls and a friend staying at home while their parents are out for the evening. They soon decide to make some prank phone calls and after a handful of amusing ones, they end up finding themselves in danger when they pick "Steve Marek" out of the phone directory. Their opening gambit is "I saw what you did and I know who you are"...which is unfortunate because Steve has just murdered his wife.Considering the subject material, it does have to be said that the tone of this film is more than just a shade too light-hearted. This is a bit of a problem as it's clear that Castle's main aim with this film was simply to entertain the audience rather than tell a story. The way it plays out is also slightly too simple and it does feel like the film could really benefit from being kicked up a notch on more than one occasion. However, despite the negative elements of the film; there are certainly a lot of good things about it too. The plot may be simple but it's always enjoyable and Castle presents us with a trio of leads that are very easy to get along with. The black and white picture and the atmosphere do benefit the film in spite of the fact that Castle goes slightly overboard with the smoke machine towards the end. Joan Crawford is the big name of the film, although she doesn't have a lot of screen time and it's the pairing of lesser known actresses Andi Garrett and Sara Lane that take the lead roles and both do well with them. It all boils down to a predictable and enjoyable ending and I did enjoy this film despite its flaws. Worth a look!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I Saw What You Did" is a fun 1965 film from William Castle, done on a shoestring but entertaining nonetheless. John Ireland plays Steve Marak, guy with a really bad temper - put it this way - the film is post-Psycho. After he kills his wife, the next door neighbor (Joan Crawford) is ready to replace her in his affections.Across town, two kids left on their own for the evening (Sara Lane and Andi Garrett) are making prank calls. I don't know if kids still do this, call someone up and say, Is your refrigerator running? Then go catch it! - maybe it was a total baby-boomer thing. Anyway, the girls take turns calling numbers, sometimes intimating they're a husband's girlfriend, or saying "I saw what you did...and I know who you are..." Unfortunately for them, Steve Marak just did something, and the idea that someone saw it and knows who he is makes him desperate to meet her.This is a real camp classic with some good suspense that brings back fond teen memories in the way that "The World of Henry Orient" did, but with some scary aspects.John Ireland is an effective killer, and Joan Crawford is scary as all get-out as the neighbor. With hair piled up on her head like a gargoyle, she really pulls out all the stops. When she verbally attacks Libby (Garrett), she sounds like Mercedes MacCambridge in "The Exorcist." This performance of Crawford's is a no-miss. And that necklace! She just wears that for a casual evening at home? Marie Antoinette should have had such jewels.Ireland and Crawford had an affair years before this film, and when actress Betsy Palmer was called by some rep of Crawford's to invite her to Crawford's wedding, Palmer thought she married "Johnny." When the caller said the groom was Alfred Steele, Palmer said "WHAT??" and pulled Crawford over at the reception. Crawford admitted that she and Steele were "in our cups" when he proposed, and she said yes.Some suspense, lots of fog, and good entertainment. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very enjoyable and suspenseful thriller from William Castle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Libby Mannering (cute brunette Andi Garrett) and Kit Austin (adorable blonde Sarah Lane) are a couple of fun-loving teenage girls who get their kicks calling strangers over the phone and exclaiming "I saw what you did and I know who you are!". Libby and Kit find themselves in considerable jeopardy when they pull this particular prank on Steve Marak (excellently played with brooding menace by John Ireland), a hot-tempered brute who's just murdered his wife (an effectively startling set piece that clearly imitates the famous shower scene from "Psycho"). Adroitly directed by William Castle, with a clever and absorbing script by William P. McGivern, a steady pace, a nicely varied score by Van Alexander that alternates between bouncy frothiness and shivery jumpiness, a good deal of tension (the last third is especially harrowing), an engagingly playful sense of lightweight humor, and sharp black and white cinematography by Joseph F. Biroc (Biroc's use of light and shadow is nothing short of masterful), this fun and gripping thriller offers proof positive that Castle could grab an audience without always resorting to gimmicks. The sound acting from a sturdy cast rates as another substantial asset: Lane and Garrett make for very pretty and appealing leads, Joan Crawford contributes a typically classy and commanding turn as Marak's headstrong lover Amy Nelson, Sharyl Locke almost steals the whole show with her delightfully spunky portrayal of Libby's bratty little sister Tess, and John Crawford has a cool bit as a state trooper. A neat little flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above-par, surprisingly gimmick-free William Castle thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Castle didn't have to result to schlocky gimmicks ("The Tingler," "13 Ghosts," etc.) to sell "I Saw What You Did." For once, he bought the rights to a terrifying novel by the estimable Ursula Curtiss ("Out of the Dark") and directed a straightforward, generally uninspired, but nonetheless enjoyable 'B' film. The premise is surprisingly simple: two teenagers spending the night together at one of their parents' homes (far too isolated for their own good) pass the time making what they think are harmless crank calls--dialing random numbers from the phone book purring to the person on the other end of the line: "I Saw What You Did and I Know Who You Are." Trouble is, the recipient of one of their calls (John Ireland) has just brutally murdered his wife. The girls think he has a sexy voice and continue to harass him. Using bits of information he pries from the unsuspecting teenagers during the course of their tele-chats, he finds the evidence he needs and proceeds to track them down. (A deliciously nasty subplot features a scenery-chewing performance by Joan Crawford, giving her all--and stealing the film--as the killer's alcoholic, man-crazy neighbor who decides his wife's "absence" provides her with the opportunity to give the poor guy female companionship (the last thing he wants, all things considered, particularly from the harpy-next-door). One can only imagine how Ms. Curtiss's truly spine-chilling novel would have been brought to the screen by a master filmmaker. And though Castle wanted the two teenage actresses who had just scored a smash hit in "The World of Henry Orient" for the leads (their parents, understandably, turned him down), they too would have been perfection had the novel been given the first-class production it deserved. Still, this cheapo version has plenty of creepy atmosphere, several well-earned shudders, and more genuinely spine-tingling, gimmick-free moments than you'll find in any other Castle specialty. It's also far superior to the miserable made-for-TV film version knocked off many years later. In short, good grisly fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of William Castle's work, I found this on DVD and had to give it a shot. Unfortunately the film just doesn't work. There is little to no suspense and only one silly murder which takes place in a shower... very original huh?The bulk of the film is two extremely annoying teenage girls and one little sister thrown in for extra high-pitched irritation, making prank phone calls and reciting idiotic dialogue. Joan's brief appearance in the film isn't even worthwhile. She doesn't even get to be her campy self.I was literally saying out loud "I hope this is over soon".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I Saw What You Did ? And I Know Who You Are" may not be the first title that springs to mind when people mention the name and reputation of the legendary filmmaker William Castle (that honor is preserved for "House on Haunted Hill" and "13 Ghosts"), but it's definitely a highly entertaining and massively ingenious slice of 60's horror with a fantastic basic plot outline and a wondrous duo of lead stars; namely Joan Crawford and John Ireland. Three young girls are home alone one night and entertain themselves by making prank calls to randomly selected names in the phone book. They arrive at the name Steve Marak, who coincidentally just slaughtered his wife in the shower with a butcher's knife. When the girls stupidly make up a prank like "I saw what you did and I know who you are", Steve naturally assumes that somebody witnessed the murder and intends to blackmail him. He tries to arrange a meeting, unaware they're just clueless teenage girls, but meanwhile his sickly jealous neighbor has seen her change to have Steve for herself. The girls begin to fantasize about what Steve looks like and can't resist driving over to his house to catch a glimpse? Okay, admittedly this is one of the silliest, most implausible and even most preposterous premises for a horror thriller ever written, but somehow the story makes sense and suckers you in completely. You can't wait to figure out what'll happen next and/or what crazy twist they'll come up with. "I Saw What You Did" is also oddly suspenseful, and this time William Castle entirely accomplishes this without the use of silly gimmicks or cheesy effects. This simply is good, plain old atmospheric storytelling with a constant fast-pacing and sublime highlights of tension. John Ireland is really chilling as the handsome killer and Joan Crawford, albeit in a fairly small role despite the top billing, is tremendously ghoulish as the sickly amorous neighbor who detests all the young birds hanging around Steve. She demands that he chooses for a mature and sophisticated woman like herself, and when Joan Crawford demands something ? you obey! This is great spooky fun from start to finish, including a nail-biting climax, and easily one of Castle's best efforts alongside the equally underrated "Homicidal" and "Mr. Sardonicus".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...And wished I didn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the synopsis of this "Thriller", I thought it was a must see. What a great idea gone to crap. The photography was flat, the acting was beyond WEAK, the score was from a sixty's sitcom, and the thrills were non-existent. This movie had such a foolproof concept, but the writing was contrived and convenient. I try to see a silver lining in most bad movies, but there's no hope for this one. I haven't seen the TV remake of this, but it has to be better. I found it hard to believe that this came out after PSYCHO, because it felt so naive and benign. Joan Crawford was the only highlight of this turkey, and I'm not even sure if it warrants the word "highlight".</fullReview>
