		<shortDescription>not quite what I expected!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I was quite surprised to see the cinema so full for this movie, even on opening weekend. I guess not that many movies for women in their 30's plus exist these days!I expected this movie, as I'm sure many people did, to be a Fatal Attraction but with the genders switched around.I was pleasantly surprised and shocked by it NOT being what I expected, and I definitely enjoyed it alot more than Fatal Attraction.The summary of this movie is that Diane Lane's character starts cheating on her husband (Richard Gere) with a beautiful French man(Olivier Martinez). Everything else should be left for surprise.The pacing of this movie is perfect. We got a sense of Connie and Edward's home life before she met the dashing Paul. They have a darling son, Charlie, who adds alot of humour to the movie, but in a non precocious way. After the affair starts we see Connie's feelings range from excitement to complete disgust with herself. And of course Edward inevitably finds out. His reaction is interesting, to say the least, and perhaps very honest.The acting is great, especially from Diane Lane. The sex scenes are pretty raunchy, and made me uncomfortable at certain points, but it's interesting to see how different sex with the lover and sex with the husband were.At the end of this movie I didn't feel cheated or robbed with some contrived ending (although others may argue differently). This film dealt with how being in an affair must feel, and how finding out you're being cheated on could make your react in uncharacteristic ways.As a movie critic said, this movie will indeed make you never have an affair!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drama as Art...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read alot of reviews here that expressed displeasure for this film based on the notion that this was basically "softcore porn for housewives" and had nothing new to offer it's audience. Ok, granted; this is not the most original film/script ever written, but I think that many reviews (both Professional and Ametuer alike) have missed the point of this film. Behind the obvious guise of a morality tale showing what can happen if you stray from your marital vows, there is a rather amazing piece of art to be seen. This film is not about marital infedelity, but, rather, about DRAMA. This is what we in the Theater refer to as Drama As Art, meaning that the plot is less important than the impact that the various plot points have on the characters, creating more and more and more drama as the story unfolds. As is the great ballets or stage plays ('Giselle', 'Whose Afraid of Virginia Wolf', 'Swan Lake' 'A Streetcar Name Desire'), the DRAMA is the star of the production, not the actors or the plot lines.And in this respect, 'Unfaithful' excells! Watch carfully as the world slowly turns itself upside down and rips itself to shreds around these two people based on a SINGLE MOMENT IN TIME (the first scene outside of his apartment: Should she go in? Should she go home? One choice, one mopment in time, a world of difference). Based on her choice(s), the drama begins to build to a point when, at the end of the film, the DRAMA is the star, not Geer and Lane. And Drama does a fine job holding this otherwise middle-of-the-road film above the frey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deeply haunting and provocative masterpiece. Stunningfilm-making.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whoever thought that director Adrian Lyne and star Richard Gere were finished needs to see this haunting and provocative film. Because this is a stunner that will put both back on the map - big time. For all their star power though, it is the female star Diane Lane who must take huge credit for making this such an effective movie.I've always liked Lane as an actress from when she was a kid in Francis Ford Coppola films, but she rarely got the chance to 'carry' a film. Well, she not only 'carries' UNFAITHFUL, she delivers one of the most haunting and powerful performances I have seen from an actress. Think Julia Roberts in ERIN BROCKOVICH or Ellen Burstyn in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and you get the picture. Stunning acting.While the committed performances are what make a great movie greater, it is Adrian Lyne who has constructed such a wonderful and effective rhythm and style to UNFAITHFUL. This is not an art-film, but it is not a blockbuster either. It lays somewhere between the two and delivers on all fronts. I was totally glued to my seat from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar nominee Diane Lane is seductive and sexy in Unfaithful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfaithful was an extremely powerful movie and was much, much more than what i had expected when i rented the dvd. Diane Lane was the main reason i got this film out because i had heard so many good things about her performance and that she has won the Oscar nomination for best actress in the films main role. Well, the hype was true. The film is excellent and Diane is seductive, sexy and downright awesome as the films main focus. She proves here what many believed before... she is a beautiful and talented star capable of carrying a movie. Richard Gere gives very solid support to her and the films director really knows his game. An all around winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about human choices, lusts, and consequences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adrian Lyne is fascinated by human sexuality and he presents it in a way that is adult but without being pornographic. Unfaithful tells the story of a perfectly normal and happy couple, Edward (Richard Gere) and Connie (Diane Lane). They look ideal: he is a very successful businessman, she is a wonderful and loving wife and mother to their young son, and they live in a beautiful home. Everything is perfect until one day Connie goes into the city to shop for her son's birthday party when a wind storm makes her bump into a handsome French librarian/book collector named Paul (Olivier Martinez). She is injured and unable to get a taxi, Paul helps her and when he was unable to get her into a taxi he offers her to come upstairs to his apartment to use a telephone and bandage up her injury. Connie is immediately attracted and fascinated by the handsome stranger, but nothing happens and she goes home but she cannot stop thinking about Paul. She goes back and finds him. In the second encounter with Paul nothing happens but she still cannot stop thinking about him and it seems very obvious to Paul that he is also attracted to her. In the third encounter, Paul and Connie have sex and it is the beginning of a tumultuous affair that will set a chain reaction of guilt, jealousy, obsession, heartbreak, and murder.I love how Adrian Lyne (very much like he did in Fatal Attraction) adds the human drama of the family breaking apart because of an infidelity. Connie was not looking for an affair and her relationship with Paul was the result of an accident. We don't even question why Connie has an affair with this person. She did it out of impulse, out of lust, and for the pure excitement of how far she could take it until she realizes the effect it begins to have on her: she begins to obsess over Paul, she is hurting the man she truly loves, Edward, and she begins to see the toll it takes on her as a mother. After another encounter with her lover she is late to pick up her son from school who is waiting for her on the steps of the school. We see the slow fall the family begins to take and we are even touched at the little child's innocence and how he never ever picks up the signals that his parent's marriage is breaking apart. The performances by the actors are especially effective particularly by the two leads: Richard Gere and Diane Lane. Gere is heartbreaking in a role that plays opposite to the playboy image that made him famous as he plays the role of a man whose own world falls apart as he begins to suspect his wife's infidelity and his own humiliation begins to take a toll on him. He never even asks his wife if she is cheating but hires a private detective. The ending when he tells Connie that it was her that he hated and it was her that he wished would die...what a great Richard Gere moment! And of course there is Diane Lane: she was beautiful at 13 and she is beautiful today. She is magnificent in this role which was originally intended for actresses like Sharon Stone and Kim Basinger who were the original choices for the role of Connie. But one word describes Lane's performance: luminous. The classic Lane moment was the scene with her on the train on her way home after her first sexual encounter with Paul. A scene that was shot only once and Lane's expressions changes from giddy, guilty, shameful, embarrassed, and excited as she cries and laughs and giggles. All of these expressions flashing through in a matter of seconds all in one shot! The scene where she finds the pictures of her and her lover taken by the private detective; How she looks through them and waves of nausea, embarrassment, guilt, and absolute regret. The scene where she sits by the fireplace as she burns the pictures taken by the PI and she looks back and wishes that she had never gone up in the apartment and if she had just gone home. Lane doesn't make us hate her character but at the same time doesn't really allow us to condone Connie's actions. She rather shows the audience that Connie is only a HUMAN being and she is not perfect and she made a mistake and that she feels lust and also feels guilt. It is a touching and sexy performance. Even Olivier Martinez plays his role effectively. He is if anything an innocent. He didn't fall in love with Connie and he wasn't searching for anyone. He was simply fulfilling his own desires and hers and it aroused him, but his desires in the end made him the victim of a tragedy that didn't need to happen. He is also very sexy and very mysterious and what woman in the planet wouldn't lust after him! Unfaithful really plays itself out as a human story about lust and the consequences but it doesn't preach. It's message is that no one is perfect and everyone is only human and we respond to the basic human desires and needs but there is always a consequence for every decision or impulse made. An excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very intriguing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is this a "great" film? Is this a Oscar-winning masterpiece? I honestly do not know. I was so engrossed in the plot that I didn't have time to judge artistic value. I was glued to my seat from start to finish. This is sassy, sexy thriller that delivers the goods and then some. But the actors make it work. The chemistry between each of the characters is electric. Though Richard Gere gets star billing, it's the beautiful Diane Lane who has the most screen time. I'm always delighted to see her beautiful face on screen, but this is her most powerful performance up-to-date. Newcomer Olivier Martinez shows great charisma. He is a very talented actor, and if he goes on with his career in American movies, he can become the next Antionio Banderas. I swear, there were moments in the film where even I felt charmed by him. Richard Gere hasn't had a successful movie in years, and hopefully he'll get back on the ball with "Unfaithful." He delivers a fine, subtle performance and though I may be out on a limb, I'll say it's one of his best. I haven't seen any of Adrian Lyne's past work, but I know he's an acclaimed director and now that I've seen this film, I'm curious to check out "Fatal Attraction" and his other past films. He definitely knows how to set the tone. The scenes have a cohesive rhythm, and I even spotted moments of symbolism. "Unfaithful" is an intriguing, compelling piece--a real edge-of-your-seat nail-biter! My score: 8 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting much from 'Unfaithful' as I thought it would be another 'The Perfect Murder' type thriller. But 'Unfaithful' is so much more than what 'The Perfect Murder' could ever be. It's deeper. It's darker. It has so many psychological layers. It's more a character driven drama rather than than plot driven. The plot may not be exactly original but it's the influence of it on the characters is what 'Unfaithful' is about. The film is very engaging as we witness the psychological effects of the consequences of Connie's decision. Lyne deserves praise for his excellent artistic execution. I loved how he used symbolism (such as metaphors and pathetic fallacies) and shows great attention to detail as is evident in the visuals. The editing is clear cut. Biziou's cinematography is great and Kaczmarek's score sets the tone. Note that during the key moments, when the main characters are conversing, the background music is absent. Richard Gere and Olivier Martinez, though a little too old, do decent jobs. However, it is Diane Lane who gives a career-defining performance. Her sublime portrayal of the incredibly sexy Connie is awesome. She carries the film. It is Diane Lane and Adrian Lyne's film. 'Unfaithful' is a magnificent engaging artistic drama. I don't understand why some were even harsh enough to call it soft-core. Do they even know the definition of soft-core? Others seem to have a problem with why Connie, who had the perfect life, would have an affair. But I feel it necessary to stress that nobody is perfect and therefore the perfect life does not exist. Connie's affair wasn't a planned thing. Who knows why it happened? Perhaps she wanted to feel younger, perhaps she was bored, or perhaps she wanted more from her husband. I don't think it was with the intention to ruin her 'perfect' life. There doesn't have to be a clear reason...as affair's don't necessarily happen for the best reasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Interesting Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story in this film is pretty much exactly what I expected. I really liked that they made Richard Gere out to be a perfect husband and a very loving husband. You really feel for his character when he finds out about the affair. I thought Diane Lane did a great job as always and looks better than ever, she is one gorgeous woman. I thought Oliver Martinez did a good job too, I'd never heard of him till seeing this film.There are a few things in the film that didn't sit well with me, but they were so minor that it's not worth talking about. And the scenes that I did like made up for it. There is one scene in particular that I just loved. If you've already seen the film, it's the scene after Richard Gere finds out about the affair. Also the ending is very interesting, I won't say it's bad or it's good, but interesting. You'll see what I mean when you see the film.I will warn you though, there are some pretty intense/graphic sex scenes in this film, so be careful who you see this film with. I'm just saying that you may feel uncomfortable watching these scenes with certain people sitting right next to you.All in all, I thought it was a very interesting movie, and the story was told quite well. I'm not sure if I liked this film better than "Fatal Attraction", but you can tell it's the work of the same director. I hope you like the film as much as I did. Thanks for reading.-Chris</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something we had ALREADY seen before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For much of his career,director Adrian Lyne has clearly had sex on the brain,or thoughts of eroticial porno,turning out huff and puff features both good(the Oscar winning Fatal Attraction and the controversial Lolita)and bad(9 1/2 Weeks and Indecent Proposal,the latter firmly cemented as one of the worst films of its decade). Happily,Unfaithful rests more toward the upper end of the spectrum;based on a 1969 French film by Claude Chabrol(La Femme Infidele),the movie sports a continental demeanor that seems wholly appreciate,but as a whole we have seen this kind of adulterated behavior several times before. Diane Lane's standout performance is what elevates the first half,which could be easily dismissed as a straight-to-cable soaper or straight-to-video softcore porno assembly. A well to do housewife seemingly content with her husband(Richard Gere,is one of his best works here and one of his finest performances since the latter part of the 80's and early 90's),her son (Erik Per Sullivan),and her home in a quaint New York(upscale Manhattan) suburb,unexpectedly enters into a torrid affair with a French book dealer(Oliver Martinez-who looks like something out of grocery store paperback novel and one of those daytime TV soap hunks). Lane's complex portrayal of a woman caught between the borders of reason and risk is simply smashing,yet eventually she's not required to carry the picture by herself,as the second half heads off in some interesting and unexpected directions that ultimately lead to the wonderful amibiguous final shot. Unfaithful works for viewers willing to put some thought into it that only works for those who want cheap thrills will probably be disappointed,but in all its a illusion of eternal bliss that will find this easily a satisfying picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great performance by Diane Lane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no such thing as an indifferent movie directed by Adrian Lyne. You'll either love it or hate it. I liked "Fatal Attraction" though I prefer the original ending, not the revised, way-over-the-top, grade B shock ending. I was not impressed with his other hit "Flashdance". (I've chosen not to see "9 1/2 Weeks" and "Indecent Proposal" for various reasons.) Many viewers have said that "Unfaithful" is simply a role reversal of Lyne's earlier hit "Fatal Attraction". It might be accurate but I don't think it's totally a fair comparison. I felt that the affair between Connie Sumner (Diane Lane) and Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez) was just a basic physical attraction. It was a need that, for some reason, was not met with her husband. At the same time, the affair became more of an addiction for Connie. There's no love at all in that relationship. There is love between Connie and Edward (Richard Gere) but from what is presented on the screen, their love is on low tide. They certainly took each other for granted. What impressed me the most about "Unfaithful" was that director Lyne and screenwriters Alvin Sargent &amp; William Broyles, Jr. (adapted from Claude Chabrol's "La Femme Infid?le") did not shy away from the consequences of having an affair. There was no easy out for Connie and Edward and no tidy endings. Gere was O.K. That's not to say he was bad. He didn't impress me very much. It was odd but rather interesting to see him play this rather drab, nerdy character. Something to consider: if the movie was remade in the late 70s or early 80s, Gere definitely would've played the other man. I was angry at Connie for having an affair and betraying her family. I also felt some sympathy toward her: She was not a bad person. She's basically a good person who made some very bad choices. One sequence that stood out for me (and apparently for many others) was when Connie is on the commuter train heading back home after her second encounter with Paul. Her facial expressions are so subtle but also tells more about what's going on with her with no dialog. The reactions range from excitement to anger to resignation to fear.(In the Special Features section of the DVD, check out the interview with veteran film editor Anne V. Coates. She brings an interesting perspective on how she was able to edit the sequence.)Diane Lane has received many well-deserved accolades for her performance. It's perhaps her best adult performance in her career which started in 1979 when she was just 14 in the wonderful comedy/drama "A Little Romance"."Unfaithful" has a few weaknesses but luckily they are overshadowed by the film's many strengths, especially Diane Lane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am writing seven years after the fact to express my bafflement over the thought that the ending, which to me was as straightforward as an arrow shot from a bow, could ever be mistaken as ambiguous.'Unfaithful' is an old fashioned morality tale, that moves in one direction almost vector-style. It is about a woman who allows a passing fancy to become an obsession, and finds the obsession devouring her entire life.Her husband ends up murdering her lover. He at first appears to have escaped consequences, but as the movie closes, it is apparent the crime will be discovered. At the end of the movie, the couple are talking in the car about love and their lives together - then the camera pans back to show they are outside a police station. To me, the thought that some have that they may run away, may not, is out of the question. The synopsis is dead wrong. This last dialog is not hopeful, but forlorn and anguished. All that they have had is irretrievably lost, due to the wife's foolishness and her husband's anger.Some members of the audience forget that characters in a movie are supposed to behave realistically. The couple in Unfaithful are far too entrenched in their upper middle class lives to have any genuine chance of flight. That last dialog is intended to underscore how much has been lost, and what devastating consequences the affair has had. It is NOT a discussion of possible alternative. The moment after the picture ends, the husband is going to surrender himself to the police. He really has no other choice.To me, this ending was sad, profound, and absolutely logical, the fitting end to a picture in which there had been a great deal of commentary on the risks of infidelity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Early in the film a violent wind storm in Manhattan (a stunning piece of cinema) brings Connie a New York suburban house wife in collision with Paul a book seller (Olivier Martinez) He notices her knee is bleeding so he invites her up to his nearby apartment so that he can dress the injury. Uncertain at first, she relents and climbs the stairs and enters his world of books. The conversation is general. The chemistry is simmering.Diane Lane as Connie is certainly the winner in this film. She is able to portray a whole range of emotions, her excitement, her anticipation, her guilt and changing attitudes in a way that sweeps you along in the dramatic turn of events. Nervous at first in entering a stranger's apartment, she quickly departs and returns home to her husband Edward (Richard Gere) and Charlie her young son.It's amazing how a single decision can change the course of one's life. Connie makes frequent calls to the book seller, not to buy his books but to enjoy his exciting company. Olivier Martinez with his soft French accent and smoldering smile is a real charmer. What woman would not yield to such a man? Yet Connie knows full well she is cheating on her husband. The guilt is written all over her face. It is these mixed emotions that Diane Lane can so capably project.The husband's discovery of his wife's affair with this young book seller explodes into violent drama. Subsequent scenes with police investigators have both the husband and wife telling lies to cover up their respective activities at the book seller's.I felt there were a few weak points in the plot. The wife seemed to me to forgive her husband's violent crime too easily. Also the body wrapped in a floor rug seemed too small and too light and too easily carried.Various reviewers argue about who was really responsible for the whole mess. I think without doubt Connie was fully to blame. She made the wrong decision in the first place. This is admirably confirmed in the later fantasy sequence where she says "No" to the book seller when he invites her in. Also the husband blamed the wife not the young Frenchman. However Connie's wrong decision was followed by multiple visits to his apartment. Paul gave her what she wanted and she continued to be mesmerized by his ardent attention.A worthy production not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>intriguing but flawed (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like his earlier smash hit, `Fatal Attraction,' Adrian Lyne's `Unfaithful' is a cautionary tale for would-be adulterers. More muted and less of a rabble-rouser than the previous film, this new work provides generally good, solid entertainment within the confines of its overworked genre.In terms of the plot, `Unfaithful' is really `Fatal Attraction' viewed from the other side. In this case, it is the wife, not the husband, who becomes the philanderer, and the betrayed spouse, not the odd-angled home wrecker, who becomes the killer. Richard Gere and Diane Lane star as Edward and Connie Sumner, a seemingly happily married couple who live with their son, Charlie, in a bucolic suburb of New York City. One day, in the midst of an urban windstorm, Connie literally bumps into a handsome French hunk named Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez) with whom she ends up having an affair. Paul's nationality is probably no arbitrary plot point since the Alvin Sargent/William Broyles Jr. screenplay is based on Claude Chabrol's famous 1969 film `La Femme Infidel.' As a director, Lyne certainly knows how to spin a good yarn, and, despite the fact that everything that occurs on the screen seems conventional and familiar, we are, nevertheless, drawn into the emotional plight that this attractive woman finds herself going through. As with all films of this type, `Unfaithful' features the obligatory scene wherein the adulterous party bumps into her gossipy girlfriends within a stone's throw of the new love interest and has to pretend that everything is hunky dory and peachy keen in her marriage. We also have the inevitable sequence in which the bold lovers are passionately making out in a restaurant while an acquaintance of the woman, unbeknownst to her, is busy taking copious mental notes of the proceedings. I also find it interesting that movies featuring female adulterers as main characters always seem to have an inordinately high number of scenes set on commuter trains. This convention goes all the way back to the 1940's and David Lean's great film `Brief Encounter' and can be seen in 1984's `Falling in Love' with Meryl Streep as well. It's just an observation, for what it's worth.Much of the success of `Unfaithful' can be attributed to Diane Lane, who manages to make her character both believable and touching, even in those moments when she is seen as being at her least morally attractive. Though we may reject what she is doing on an intellectual level, we can certainly identify with the immense internal struggle she is going through between intense, physical passion on the one hand and a sense of duty to husband and family on the other. Had the movie been content to play out the story in a more realistic way, it might have avoided the disappointment that comes in the second half. I guess that the filmmakers felt that trying to resolve this dicey situation without resorting to melodrama would make for less of an impact at the box office, so we are confronted with the inevitable shift to a crime thriller scenario. In a way, the filmmakers are to be congratulated for at least toning down this aspect of the plot, which ? as it did in `Fatal Attraction' ? could easily have spiraled off into over-the-top excess. Yet, for some odd reason, the result of this subtle approach is, paradoxically, to give to the movie an unformed and unfinished feel, as it dribbles away into a lady-or-the-tiger copout ending.Although Lane does a beautiful job capturing the subtle emotional nuances of her character, the same cannot always be said for Gere, who comes across as stiff and stodgy much of the time. Even worse is Olivier Martinez, who barely registers at all in the poorly written part of the dashing young lover. In all fairness to the actor, however, one should note that he isn't really given much to work with here. The real scene-stealer turns out to be young Erik Per Sullivan, the youngest brother from `Malcolm in the Middle,' who lights up the screen with his unaffected, good-natured charm.It's been a long time since I've seen Chabrol's `La Femme Infidel,' but I remember feeling, as I was watching that film, that, despite the fact that the story itself was conventional and almost hackneyed, I was in the hands of a master artist who could make me see truths contained in the material that I had never perceived before. Lyne's film, though involving at times, never gets close to that level of mastery and insight. `Unfaithful' has its moments, but it ends up settling for competency at the expense of artistry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every now and then, I read a review of a film which is so drastically different to my own reaction to it that I wonder if we have watched the same film. This is the case for almost EVERY review of "Unfaithful". Aside from the occasional positive comment that I have read by other IMDB users, and the glowing review given by Margaret Pommeranz on the (Australian) "Movie Show" (four and a half stars, if I remember correctly), this film seems to have met with either negative or ambivalent reactions from everyone. And this surprises me immensely, because I was overwhelmed by it. I expected quite a good, slightly arty film with good performances (particularly from Diane Lane, who really impressed me in Coppola's "The Cotton Club"). What I got was a film which I think will be one of my favourites for many years to come.The criticisms that I have read of "Unfaithful" don't confuse me because they disagree with me. I can accept that - no really, I can, although I don't see how anyone could miss the brilliant acting (one user comment said that any Hollywood actress could have done Diane Lane's performance - well, I DO look forward to the J.Lo remake in a few years), or the amazing photography, this being one of the most lush and seductive films I have seen in a long time. It's the way in which the reviewers have seemingly missed the entire point of the film, or fell asleep half-way through it.Firstly, I will concede that Connie's motivations were unclear (although I'd call it subtlety, rather than poor scripting), but they weren't as unclear as many people would have you believe. Nor did Lyne simplify the relationship between Connie and Paul (someone called him Marcel - perhaps they DID watch another movie, or just couldn't spell his surname) - in fact, I would suggest that anyone who thought Connie was willing to sleep with the first guy she met would do well to rewatch this film and see the way that her mind works (or do you need a voice-over narration in addition to Lane's phenomenal performance?). In addition to this, I have read complaints about nudity (because apparently has no place in an erotic drama/thriller), technical problems (the reviewer who mentioned this loved the movie, but had issues with constant shots of the entire microphone, shots which he/she found very hard to ignore, but which I managed to miss completely) and the apparently "cliched" narrative. In response to the latter, I don't want to give anything away, but this film, although addressing a common topic (ie. adultery), is by no means a traditional Hollywood film, and certainly doesn't treat the topic in the same way that every other film has. Many may find the ending unfulfilling, but I can't comprehend the idea of it being cloying and unoriginal. And even if the narrative itself is conventional, the way in which it is handled by cast, director and technical crew (if you can forgive the microphone shots, I suppose) puts it so far above any of its counterparts as to warrant a much warmer reception than it seems to have been given.Diane Lane deserved the Oscar for this, without question. Unfortunately, her film came in a year when every single Best Actress nominee was of nearly equal quality. As you can see, I liked it - and wish that more people felt the same way about it. The only suggestion I can offer is that, if you have yet to see it, then don't go into it expecting a standard thriller - in fact, it can be quite slow-moving at times. But let it be what it is, because it does a damn good job at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't go see this movie based on the fact it's labeled a thriller. Even though it includes a murder (which is not even premeditated), it actually is a drama and centers more on the damage caused by the affair.Unfaithful shows an emotional depth rarely found in mainstream movies, and the common nature of the subject (who hasn't seen unfaithful people around them?) makes it all the more involving for the audience. The film is an acting tour de force, especially on Diane Lane's part. Her portrayal of Constance Sumner, a housewife torn between the attraction she feels towards a predatory Frenchman (Paul Mortel, portrayed by Olivier Martinez) and the guilt she feels because of it is stunning. The scene where she returns home on a commuter train after their first sexual encounter and alternates between exhilaration and despair is unforgettable. Paul Mortel is reckless and causes her to take all sorts of risks of being discovered as their affair progresses, which makes her struggle to maintain the appearance of a normal life all the more interesting. Richard Gere also gives a good performance as the husband who crashes down to earth after first suspecting and then obtaining confirmation of what is going on.The movie has some weaknesses. For example, I am wondering why the police detectives couldn't get a listing of the people who called at the victim's apartment on the days before the murder. They would certainly have been able to establish a connection with the murderer. The movie also does not have an explicit ending, which may not please some viewers.However, Unfaithful is worth seeing just for the acting, and tends to sit on your mind long after you've seen it, a bit like Hitchcock's Vertigo. You'll think twice before having an affair now.</fullReview>

Wasn't a full cinema unlike many previews and I soon learne why.Gaping holes in the narrative and pictures: eg (1) 'just phoning you to find out where you are' 'oh, come over' =hangup. Durh where ARE you ? (2) Oooo I feel SO sexy let's get in the bath with you - I will be wearing my swimming trunks though!!! [NOTE to film editor, just because the male lead is over 50 you don't have to show us he won't bare all!] (3) Lovely old fashioned worn unvanished creaky floorboards so they'll be completely impervious to any bloodstains as long as I spend a few minutes rinsing them with water (4) Laurel and Hardy are the cops prepared to drive an hour out of town (each way) on a weekend to make enquires about a murder, so if I say my wife's told you everything she knows after you prove she's lying with your second question, you'll just * off and leave us to our crass 1+1+1 family life while they go back to their stage comedy routine (5) FILMGOERS: If you want to see how a family can be affected by distance (physical or mental etc) between the couple and their children and the affect a relationship and a death can have on them and what family members are prepared to do for each other then watch the MANY HUNDREDS times better THE DEEP END.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a couple of outstanding performances and stylish filming, Unfaithful is watchable but not re-watchable. The logic of the film falls apart in the story line and through certain implausibe and inexplicable scenes. Dianne Lane is gorgeous, even when Lynne tries to show her as a semi-frumpy house wife.The chemistry between Lane and Gere is non-existent. And Erik Per Sullivan is totally unbelievable as Gere and Lane's child.(I imagine in one scene that Lynne suggested to Sullivan "Put the collander on your head. Yeah, that'll work.") The dialog at home is cheesy and forced. In no way did I believe that Lane and Gere loved or cared about each other or their child at any point in the film. Throw into the mix the chance encounters Lane has with friends and employees from her husband's business, the way that Gere acts toward his employees and the totally lack of discretion on Lane's part and you get a forced tale of washed up cliches, sterotypes, improper casting and poor scripting.The only saving grace in the whole movie are the voracious sex scenes and especially Lane's recollection of one in particular.The ending...well lets just say that if a train would have came crashing through the intersection, I would have been happy.</fullReview>

The trailers have you thinking it's another thriller along the lines of A Perfect Murder or Fatal Attraction but it is much.much more than that. Unfaithful is a superbly directed and superbly acted character study and the tragic consequences of someone's actions. It sounds very familiar but it isn't. It's a first class and very absorbing thriller with a stand-out performance by award winner Diane Lane. In fact it is Diane Lane's unforgettable performance which lifts Unfaithful from superb to greatness. A new classic of the genre has been delivered and delivered with style and heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Except for Gere, just plain awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first beef with this movie is to the marketing/ad department for making this film seem like some "suspense/thriller" that involves some element of mystery. Let me dispell that myth. There is none. The ads are basically lies.This movie is about adultery, plain and simple. If you get a thrill from watching lots of movie sex (apparently many people here do), then this film is for you. Lane and her movie lover have plenty of it in various places all over Chicago. Connie (Lane) and Edward Sumner (Richard Gere) seem to have it all. He's a successful engineer and she's a homemaker/Junior Leaguer. They live in the typical movie house in the movie suburbs with the typical cute movie child. That part of the comparison to Fatal Attraction is true. Only in this movie, the child is a boy and his rabbit isn't boiled. He does wear a rabbit costume in his school play, which I found hilariously ironic.As in Fatal Attraction, a spouse has a fling for reasons that can't truly be fathomed. Edward is no slouch and is an attentive husband. The kid is too cute for words. But for some reason, she falls into instant lust with Paul, a smoldering-eyed French bookseller. And that's all it is. Lust. Oh, and he quotes from his various books, too. At least in Fatal Attraction, Michael Douglas' character realizes he's been an idiot. Connie Sumner (Lane) never truly does. I guess that's because she's "living freely" or "soul searching". Never mind that she destroys her family and probably gave her husband herpes. This is the MOVIES where STDs or unplanned pregnancies never happen!*SPOILERS*With little regard for her marriage or family, Connie dives into a series of "nooners" with Paul. They don't talk much but they don't need to since sex is what brings them together. She takes horrific risks and doesn't seem too concerned about it. If there had been some kind of exploration of their relationship, what made her take such risks with him, I might have enjoyed this movie. But you don't get anything like that here. Sex is the answer to Connie's woes.Edward, bewildered at his wife's lack of focus at home and (her new sexy shoes), starts sniffing around. He doesn't confront Connie. No, he confronts Paul. And kills him with a snowglobe. His attempts to hide it and dump the body are comical. He never really gets mad at Connie. No, he's trying to protect his family. Nothing much ever gets said about Connie's infidelity. Poor thing.*END OF SPOILERS*Diane Lane has gotten plenty of kudos for this movie. I'm not sure why. She looks like she's having a great time having sex, especially against a bathroom wall. Does that take much talent? To some, I suppose. She gets a charge out of wearing new sexy outfits for her lover. She doesn't mind lying to her family or forgetting to pick up her son at school. I guess that's what people call "good acting" these days. Not in my book.Gere, despite the awful script, tries to do what he can. He and the cute movie kid are about all that I liked about this film.If you're looking for a suspense/thriller, please avoid this film. If you enjoy movies with lots of meaningless sex, you'll love this one. Then again, there's plenty of that around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am amazed at how many people actually thought this was a good movie. It's not even close to good. Its predictable, silly, and even downright boring at times. Adrian Lyne's best? Hardly. In fact, IMO the only film Lyne has ever made that was really worth watching was Jacob's Ladder.Yes, Diane Lane shows her body in "Unfaithful"... So what? There are other films that showcase her talent AND her body far better ("Walk on the Moon" being one of my personal favorites).The only real shining star in this movie is Olivier Martinez, and he doesn't have much to work with here. I'd skip "Unfaithful" and see "Le Hussard sur le toit" ("Horseman on the Roof") instead.If you simply want to be entertained &amp; go with no expectations beyond that, you'll probably enjoy this movie well enough. But if you believe the hype that you see here on IMDB and/or in the TV ads, you WILL be disappointed. This is absolutely NOT a brilliant piece of film making, not by a long shot.c-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>UNFAITHFUL is the best thriller this year. A superbly acted, powerful film. Diane Lane is incredible in this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Diane Lane is a knock-out and Richard Gere shines in sexy, cool and engrossing thriller.Adrian Lyne's Unfaithful is sensational sex-and-its-consequences melodrama at it's very best. It's a movie in which an ordinary woman from the New York suburbs, played with startling conviction and amazing range by the beautiful Diane Lane, begins to sneak away from her beautiful white dream home in the Hudson Valley, deceiving the family she loves so much in order to indulge in a cathartic sexual fling with a simply gorgeaous French hunk who's built like an Adonis. Her husband slowly suspects and then learns of the affair, and when he discovers how far it's gone, his reaction comes as as big a shock to him as it does to us.''Unfaithful'' is a domestic thriller that's been made with so much sultry juice and power that it is bound to have you thinking and talking about it long after the end credits roll. What the film observes very, very well is the deep, rich comforts of family life aren't always enough to keep even a contented person from straying.Connie Sumner (Lane) loves her doting, slightly fuddy-duddy security contractor husband, Edward (Richard Gere), as well as the life they share with their perky 8-year-old son. So why does she let herself be seduced by Paul (Olivier Martinez), the insinuating Gallic book dealer who rescues her from a SoHo, New York windstorm? Is it because he's the sort of philosophe stud who drops pensées like ''There's no such thing as a mistake -- there's what you do, and what you don't do''? The film refuses to offer the usual excuses (e.g., cold-fish husband), and that makes the real reason all the more compelling. Connie slides into a fling because she's a sensual woman whose contentment is tinged with complacency, and because the opportunity presents itself in a way that's too sexy to resist.Once she gives in to Paul's charms, though, she gets addicted to them. The further he pushes her (a bit of S&amp;M; a shag in a bistro bathroom), the further she wants to go. Lyne shoots the sex scenes like slivers of delirium that flirt with but never slide into fantasy, and Lane, in the most urgent performance of her long career, is nothing short of incredible -- a revelation. The play of lust, romance, degradation, and guilt on her face is the movie's real story. I hope the Academy remeber this performance, because it is Oscar worthy without doubt.Diane Lane's work in the film's intriguing and gripping second half, however, wouldn't be possible without Richard Gere's own understated performance that is one of his very best. As these two circle each other, their marriage held together by the very cycle of forbidden acts that's also tearing it apart, ''Unfaithful,'' like a more languid ''Fatal Attraction,'' becomes a thriller myth of the perils of adultery, which few filmmakers can heighten like Adrian Lyne."Unfaithful" is a first rate, sexy, cool and engrossing Hollywood thriller that is also refreshingly intelligent. 10 out of 10 for a GREAT movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is without doubt one of the best thriller/dramas I have ever seen. It follows the struggle a once happily married couple face when one commits adultery. That's not all. Things go dangerously awry (if not downright terrifying) for the couple as well, as the serious situations escalate out of control. Diane Lane owns this film in what has to be one of the alltime great performances made by an actress. She is also great to look at and redefines sexy and attractive. Richard Gere delivers the performance of his long career in a support role that asks a lot of him. Newcomer Olivier Martinez is simply charismatic and "hunky" as the lover. The film has a thought provoking and very intelligent message and the ending is unpredictable and very well done. 'Unfaithful' is a provocative and sensual masterpiece that is remarkably entertaining and gripping. A winner and it's boxoffice and critical acclaim are well deserved. Full marks here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melodramatic Left Turn Overwhelms What Was A Haunting Character Study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the first two-thirds of the movie, Diane Lane gives a haunting and top-quality star turn as a suburban housewife having an affair. Indeed, the movie unfolds as an anatomy of that affair and what will happen while soft-spoken and loving husband Richard Gere eventually finds out about it. Things progress interestingly - if a bit overboard in the imaginative sex department - until Lane comes finally and grimly to realization that she must end the affair.What happens next transforms Unfaithful into the realm of tawdry melodrama with no option of returning. The viewer is abruptly reminded of Glenn Close's abruptly violent spiral into insanity during the last third of Director Lyne's Fatal Attraction. Only the type of behavior exhibited by the character in question that adopts this posture is even more over-the-top and harder to reconcile with the character during the prior scenes in the movie. What ensues are scenes that recall Torn Curtain and The Trouble With Harry turning a sophisticated character study into a mock-Hitchcockian melodramatic thriller. Too Bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard so many great things about this movie so I rented it. I was terribly disappointed. I thought the movie would be similar to Fatal Attraction, which was a great movie, by the way. Unfortunately Unfaithful is just about a married woman and her lover having sex. There is no character development. I had no sympathy for Diane Lane's character. To say her acting was great is an overstatement, imo. Basically her character has an affair with a younger man and yet we aren't given any clues as to why she would have one. Is she unhappy in her marriage? Apparently not, at least not what we're shown at the beginning of the movie. And unless this is not the first time she has strayed from her marriage or she does this often, I have a hard time believing this storyline. But then again we have no idea because we don't know anything about the characters. I made my own assumptions that Diane Lane's character was a selfish woman who forgot everything, including her kid (which by the way, who is taking care of him while she is off having sex in public places?), as she carries on this affair, that is mainly just sex. Then she has the nerve to get mad at the guy when she sees him with someone else. As my husband pointed out, she's married, what did she expect? *SPOILERS* I sympathized with Richard Gere's character but at the same time I'm wondering why he isn't confronting his wife instead of her lover. They never even seem to talk about the affair and she never even says she's sorry. And the ending? There is no ending, no resolution.</fullReview>

Better acting from Richard Gere than from Michael Douglas. I also think that Diane Lane made a very solid performance. The music was very very good. Especially in some of the final scenes where Edward is sitting with his son by the piano.Flaws?? hmm, perhaps why Diane Lane´s character seems to be so intrested in the Paul Martel-charcter. I think he was very disgusting the whole film.another flaw that is more serious is that it´s going too slow from time to time.

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable drama/thriller helped by a great Lane performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie about being unfaithful. you probably guessed that. The unfaithful person is one Connie Sumner (Diane Lane), wife to Edward (Richard Gere). Edward is actually a nice guy, and a loving father to their child Frank (`Malcolm in the Middle' star Erik Par Sullivan). Nonetheless Connie is not content with her somewhat staid home life. One day - caught in a Storm of Foreshadowing! - she is thrown into the life of a Frenchman Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez). He is much younger than her and gradually tempts her into getting with them. Connie must decide whether she can live with this secret affair, or will her misdeeds strike back!! Dum dum DA!The first half of the movie is interesting. It's principally played from Connie's point-of-view. Diane Lane is quite excellent here - she's neither the selfish wife and yet she does not overplay the guilt role. She's never quite comfortable in her extra-marital affair but this is conveyed in nice subtle ways - Paul and her are ever only about sex for example (there's no real conversation between them). The whole thing is just a means of escapism - there's no real love there and Lane lets us clearly see this. She portrays passion well, but also the other emotions such as love and, on some level, sadness at being where she is. The minutiae of her performance are what make this movie worth seeing.Unfortunately the acting abilities of the rest of the cast are nothing special. Martinez gets by on merely looking good and saying suggestive things in silky tones. His character - mostly just a catalyst for Connie and Edward - is incredibly one dimensional, not helped by the forgettable performance. Gere is OK, even when he does get centre stage in the movie. His performances tend to fairly sedate - whether this is him purposely playing a (mostly) controlled character, or a lack of acting ability is not for me to say here. He's a nice guy, who has his suspicions about his wife's change, and reacts in a bog-standard movie way (quite disappointing in some senses). Their kid is just cute and while his lines do actually sound like that of an eight year olds, he's still just blandly `cute kid #1035'.Adrian Lyne, the director here, is back at his usual forte of adult relationship thrillers. It's all pretty good - some nice symbolic touches (ohh look a shot of a kettle on a hot stove as Connie wincingly dabs her cut!), and an ending that's agreeably ambiguous (and well shot). The pacing here is generally pretty good (the use of two main characters helping), although that can't help the disappointing nature of the second half of the movie. Still `Unfaithful' is above average for it's type, mostly due to Lane. Catch it on TV sometime as it does not requite a big screen. 6.3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The force of "Unfaithful" is not to be measured.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I regard this movie as a "perfect storm," fed by the hitherto unjoined forces of Lyne, Lane, Gere and Martinez. They've taken an ordinary agony and turned it into a terrible passion, and no one who's seen it can walk away untouched (or, in some cases, undrowned).This fact (and it is a fact), is most apparent in the comments of viewers who don''t like or respect the movie (fully half the comments published thus far have expressed such a point of view). For them, nothing has happened, everything is vulgar, obvious, boring, overdone, or entirely predictable. Everything, that is, except for their own disappointment, indignation, or contempt, which they find rather lively and even refreshing--lucid, assured, sensible, and worthy of our consideration. If they could only add a touch of humor to their enlightened argument, they might at least give Lyne some credit for having managed to annoy them (since no one, so far as I can tell, is merely indifferent to what he's done).Some hostile viewers, recognizing that the movie does, perhaps, somehow really happen, find themselves conceding that Diane Lane does a wonderful thing in a vehicle beneath her talents. But their point is absurd, for "How can we tell the dancer from the dance?" Lane herself, in a number of interviews, has given Lyne all due credit for having pushed her well past her "plateau". There was no Lane before Lyne. Somewhere she compares the experience of making this movie to the trials of giving birth, and tells us, one year after, that she's still recovering from its labor pains. She gave birth to a performance of indelible impact. Who knows what will follow from this--for her, for ourselves, for movies wherever they happen?One last thing: Lyne doesn't yield up his secrets gladly. After five viewings, I've hardly begun to read "Unfaithful". and unless I'm mistaken, it will be around for a long time to come--like "Psycho," or "Casablanca".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad, Thought Provoking - Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS I was upset at viewing the trailer for this movie, let alone see it. Being a faithful, loving husband as myself with full trust in my gorgeous young wife, the subject disturbed me. A happy TRUSTED wife and mother would give everything up for a little sex, and nasty sex at that. He just doesn't have sex with her, he pretty much f---s her every way possible. Lane does a great job at getting the whole story across with her facial expressions, she has done really well here. Gere's confrontation scene is PERFECT, it was so real, I felt every word that he says to her, and can believe it knowing that I would feel the same way myself.The question of this movie is asked, what is the bigger sin? The affair, or the murder?? I feel sorry for Gere's character, he got screwed by his wife, then he screwed himself when he reacted to the affair. Seriously think about it, you find out that your loving wife is getting it on with some dirtball (who could have any disease in the book) and treating your wife like a piece of meat, of course the thoughts are going to be stirred up of what they did. I would say that's a clear case of temporary insanity, if he wouldn't have hid the body, he might have been able to get a fair day in court. I am ticked about the ending though, why show us a story about these two lives if you didn't intend on finishing the story. "Draw your own conclusions," the director says. I say, "screw that, I wanna know." Of course, we all know what probably happened though.This just proves the point that cheaters are scum, any way you slice it, or try to justify it, they ARE scum. I just wish everybody would get caught like Conny did, but without the murder, just the "I HATE YOU, YOU PIG" speechYES the murder is the bigger sin, but the way the affair was portrayed (thinking of it happening in real life) made it a real tossup. I don't agree with what Edward did, he should have just beat the crap out of him. Then went home, got drunk, told his wife off, then threw her out on the street. Take the pictures, go to court and take the kid off his wife except weekends, that would have been more realistic. She had a cozy place in SOHO to stay, I would have told her to go there from now on.Any movie this thought provoking is a decent movie, I give it a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfathomable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In short, if you like bad movies or movies that receive undue critical acclaim, then this one is for you. The problem in the movie does not stem from bad acting, but from bad directing and a horrible screenplay. The entire script is contrived and the director does not know how to have his character's interact so it appears that they have chemistry. Also, whoever cast Dewey from Malcolm in the Middle as the young boy should be shot.****Spoilers****Problem #1: How corny and romance-novelish is it for the protagonist and her soon to be lover to be blown together literally by a freak wind storm.Problem #2: How formulaic is it for the forbidden lover to be a handsome french guy, schooled in the art of seduction. See any lame romance novel you've ever read that wasn't set in Texas. The guy's name should have been Jacque Cliche.Problem #4: Um, I believe the screenwriter's message was sometimes people have affairs without anything being wrong with their relationships. I believe this is why the protagonist has an affair although we don't see anything quite wrong with her home life. Keeping this in mind, I think the screenwriter should not tackle stories about the human condition until he or she realizes that people have motivation's for everything they do, whether they realize it or not. To think people are inherently whimsical is not a mature assessment of the human condition. That being said, it is up to the screenwriter to show the movie watchers what the protagonist's motivation was whether the protagonist realizes it or not. This didn't happen.Problem #5: The dialogue was bad.Problem #6: I was prepared for all these sex scenes that were supposed to be really powerful. They could have been if there was sufficient chemistry to believe that the Diane Lang's character was actually having passionate sex with the french guy. I've seen more chemistry in a Cinemax soft porn. Just because she's doing her own nudity and protesting in cliche dialogue that she doesn't want to have sex, although she obviously does, does not make chemistry. We should feel that Diane Lange wants to get with Jacque Cliche for other reasons than a french accent, good looks, and a rugged/well-read poet/renaissance man thing going for him because that's been done to death.****Spoilers****There was other obvious plot problems but I won't go into them. So if you don't mind all the stuff I mentioned, this film's a winner.1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something to think about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adrian Lyne did a great job with this movie. I don't agree that it is forbidden love but rather the weakness of the human nature, which is brilliantly portrayed by Diane Lane as Connie Sumner. The dialogue is brief but intense and though the movie may test your patience a bit, you can't help but want to know what happens in the end as it is obvious right from the start that this is not one of those typical happy-ending movies. There was just enough nudity to showcase the lust that Connie Sumner and Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez) have for each other but it doesn't get into soft-porn territory thus ensuring the movie's integrity as a spectacular drama. As it is not one of those ordinary dramas about extra-marital affairs, it does give you something to think about, even if it is the mundane things like why did she do it? Why did she risk everything inspite of all the good things she had? It was so brilliantly directed that you can't help but swear to yourself you'll never get into the same situation. I know I did!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is plain as day that this movie is about infidelity. I think I could have wrote this movie because many of the scenes were so predictable. I guess Diane Lane was looking for some excitement in her life. This guy named Paul is young,wise and confident,and show Lane the wild side of life. Which I think most middle-aged woman are looking for and mistake it for love. Paul played by Oliver Martinez is the man we call today the bad boy thug in the movie. Just like a thug who's dealing with a woman makes sure things will go in his direction. That's what Paul did made sure things go his way by seeing how interested she was in him. But like all extramarital affairs someday you will get caught.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Warn: After reading numerous comments re.this question, and many Official Critics, I was curious as to why no one mentions Connie's "testing" her risk level, scratching at an edgy romance that shows/implies 'rough sex",commencing with the 'slapping' mutually enjoyed by Marcel and Connie,while ending in her being rear ended as the final degradation..Some point out her possible motives as being "boredom", reaching mid life crisis, guilt from an all too 'perfect' marriage and lifestyle..very comfortable..However, we learn too little of her/their backstory/past to comprehend if her 11 year marriage merely covers a shadowed past...child abuse, rape etc...No, I don't dismiss the possibility that Connie is just another suburban housewife, like her aging friend who warns her of disastrous consequences, who represent 'unfulfilled' adult/ female achievement,seeking adventurous romance to attract males all too willing to reassure these women of their 'worth'. We see Connie raising money for charities..do gooder, but in this story,she and friends from upper mid.class seemingly have no professions/self fulfilling endeavors.. Their lives lead to an unfulfilled ending, something like this director's choice for final scene...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Women will understand why this woman does what she does. Olivier Martinez is a DOLL, that's why! The scene where Diane Lane and her friends are stuck in the coffeeshop and he walks in and the comments that her friends make about his sexiness says it all. Contrary to what other people may say, I think that this whole plot is a very real scenario. The wife did not set out to have an affair. A strong attraction comes into her life totally unexpectedly and the exciting out-of-the box sex that her lover offers becomes addictive to her for a period of time. **SPOILER**The fact that she ultimately decides to end it of her own volition is very important to the credibility that she does have a happy homelife and knows that her adulterous life cannot go on indefinitely.The confrontation between Richard Gere and the lover is also very real to me. You want to warn Paul not to let him in, but he is naive and looks at the whole situation quite realistically, because he knew all along that he was having sex with a married woman and that his emotional involvement could only go so deep. The way that Gere erupts is also very credible, showing that his action was not planned, but a spontaneous act of passion from a man out of his mind with emotion and grief.Yes, Diane Lane was stunning and brilliant. Yes, I think that she should be nominated for Best Actress. And, I also think kudos should go to the director and editor for keeping my eyes riveted to the screen from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfaithful is a powerful story about passion, desire and trust. Connie Sumner has a pretty good life, a husband to who she has been married for 11 years and a bright kid, charlie, who is nine years old. One day Connie is downtown and the strong wind knockes her down and she hurts her knee. Suddenly, this young attractive man helps her and invites her to his house for a band-aid and a drink. This seemed kinda funny and naive to me, not most people just go up to stranger's houses like that but anyways. The young man introduces himself as Paul and that he is a bookdealer. Nothing happens yet, but you can tell there are some sparks among them, especially when Connie grabs a book and Paul tell's her to read one of the lines, which was " be happy for this moment, this moment is your life". Connie exits and in the further days she begins to think more and more about paul, not being able to concentrate on anything else. She calls him finally and they meet at his house and there begins their first sexual encounter. That's when the lying begins and Connie starts going to his house more often, every day even for a quick love making. Her Husband, Edward Sumner played by Richard Gere starts getting suspicious and wonders where Connie's head is at. The affair gets out of hand and then the jealousy starts and it turns out ugly. This is a very moving movie about what an affair can do to a family. Diane Lane gives an Amazing Performance, Oscar Worth. I would give Unfaithful 9/10</fullReview>

The direction is very classy and the film looks great. Diane Lane proves that she is one of Hollywood's very best actresses in a role that is a little reminiscent of her character in "A Walk On The Moon". In this she is even sexier though!Lane really owns the film and is so powerful both in her presence and in her acting ability that she is the character that you remember the most from the film. All in all a very satisfying thriller that is exciting and entertaining whilst being a powerful story. Two thumbs up!10/10</fullReview>

It has REAL characters, made all the more believable by a great cast that is at the peak of it's game. DIANE LANE is incredible and mesmerizing and deserves the major kudos she has got for the film.

		<shortDescription>A powerful and intelligent study of infidelity with great acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My husband and I caught Unfaithful at a screening in London. We had heard it was an impressive film and that it had been a big success in America. Having said that, I usually hate Richard Gere, although Diane Lane I feel is a great actress. Anyway, we gave it a shot and were not disappointed at all.The film builds slowly, but there are some great spots of humor which helped, especially Diane and Richard's son, who was really cute, but not annoying. The sex scenes were very erotic and very nicely and stylishly done. The tension builds begins to wind-up when Richard Gere starts to suspect that Diane Lane is doing things she shouldn't. It gets very exciting and suspenseful, and I found myself holding my breath at times.Olivier Martinez is a real find, he is very cute and has charm in abundance. This is by far the best I have seen Richard Gere for years, he looks better than he has for ages, and also gives a good performance. He actually acts extremely well here.Unfaithful is really Diane Lane's tour-de-force though, and she is so brilliant as Constance that it is hard to remember a better female star performance. When, near the end of the film, she pictures what would have happened if she'd turned the other way and not gone with Martinez, Lane is simply heart-breaking in her intensity and emotions. There is also a scene when she is travelling home on the train after a sex session and she is so overcome with conflicting emotions that she literally breaks down - laughing, crying, etc. It is a jaw-dropping piece of acting that had the audience stunned in admiration.The pivotal part of the film is when Gere confronts Martinez, and this was an extremely well done, powerful and jolting moment. Brilliantly executed and shocking in it's intensity. The more I think about Unfaithful, and believe me - you will be thinking about it long after the end credits, the more I realized how much I loved it.Unfaithful is a powerful and intelligent study of infidelity, that is hard to criticize. It really is, in my opinion, near perfect, and a definite must-see, even just for Diane Lane's mesmerizing performance.10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When 'no' means 'I don't know'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happened to Hollywood's affinity to glorifying sex and violence? Have they turned the corner and headed towards family values with a vengeance? Morality plays well as the two lovers fall for each other, literally, in one of the windiest sequences you've seen since 'Twister.' The young Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez) and Constance Sumner (Diane Lane) are thrust together by natural forces but then libido and compulsion take it from there. The offer to salve her skinned knees starts their rather brisk relationship from flirtation to obsession.Hubby Edward (Richard Gere) starts to suspect that Constance is developing interests beyond fund-raising auctions, school plays and recreational gardening. And is he on target.This is a well-crafted film that works on many levels. If you enjoy symbolism you'll be entertained by with careful choice of props, like the murder weapon, and weather, like the windstorm. And believable performances delivered by Martinez and Lane and a rare sincerity shown by Gere. It wasn't so long ago that he played the gigolo. But it's hard to look at Erik Per Sullivan without seeing his 'Malcolm in the Middle' character. He adds some genuine innocence and comic relief to the intense emotional drama unfolding. Let's hope this helps propel him beyond type casting.The story will make you reflect on fidelity, urban/suburban dichotomy and retribution. If "Fatal Attraction" didn't get to you, this one will.</fullReview>

When they show him drinking vodka at the mans apartment...what are you thinking? When the wife figures it all out...are you scared, what do you think will happen?

		<shortDescription>Don't mess with a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Warning: Spoiler)  The whole trouble with Adrian Lyne's `Unfaithful' is that it's an American remake by a commercial British director of a cynical, edgy 1969 French thriller, Claude Chabrol's `La Femme Infidele.' One could argue that Lyne's track record damns him from the start, linking him as it does more than a little with the likes of Zalman King, for whom adultery is just a way of spicing up some soft core sex. `Unfaithful' is not without merit ? Richard Gere as Edward Sumner allows himself to step down from supercilious glamour to be a bit of a loser, a man not sexy to his wife; Diane Lane's performance as that wife, Connie, who falls under the spell of Paul Martel, Olivier Martinez's good natured, but stereotypical version of a young SoHo-dwelling Euro-hunk, is energetic and committed and the public has loved it. But what in Chabrol's film was bright, hard and gripping in the manner of Hitchcock and Highsmith becomes, in Lyne's hands, a messed-up woman's picture, full of fantasy, guilt, unresolved emotion and unresolved action. To begin with ? and this beginning weighs down the movie --the affair between Connie and Paul is so glamorous, sexy, reckless and hot that it appears to be an end in itself and the husband's subsequent revenge seems like quite another ? way too long ? movie. Lyne's mixed messages are signaled by the fact that the mise-en-scene, the whole look of the movie, is far too glitzy and unreal throughout `Unfaithful,' starting with the dreadfully overdone windstorm that throws Connie and Paul into each other's arms on Mercer Street.  And Lyne doesn't know how to end the warped version of Chabrol's story he has created. He hates for Gere's character to get punished for his revenge (aren't Edward and Connie close again once Paul's out of the way? Wasn't their marriage really fine all along?), but, well, murder is a Bad Bad Thing; so after suggesting any number of endings, `Unfaithful' stops with the final outcome all up in the air. And the bumbling around, the groping for a suitable finale, makes the movie's final half hour seem interminable. All of `Unfaithful's' flaws can be traced to its departures from Chabrol's classic: why tinker with a masterpiece? Chabrol's tweaking of French bourgeois smugness and boredom is lost because Lyne's movie isn't willing to show the suburban marriage as anything but smooth and glossy ? perfect, really. They've got a lovely house, nice lives, a cute, engagingly quirky and outspoken nine-year-old son (Erik Per Sullivan of `Malcolm in the Middle' makes a bit of a Shakespearean child). After the husband (Gere) half-accidentally gets rid of the lover, the couple is reunited in guilt and angst: it's so mushy. Chabrol's couple found their sex lives greatly improved. Lyne's movie isn't that cool. Lyne's lover is so glamorized, such an older woman's fantasy, that the movie loses track of his main function in the original story: in Chabrol's film, the lover was basically just a huge problem. Lyne makes him a super-turn on, and then just a huge source of guilt. There's no resolution. True, Diane Lane nearly saves the picture at times, because her slightly worn beauty ? she's a little frayed, but still very attractive, and, as her women friends say, she's still got the same ass she had in college ? makes us want her to go out and have fun. And when the fun is too intense and too guilt-ridden, as in the great sequence where we see Lane in the commuter train after the first sex session, her face taking us through all the emotions of adulterous passion, intercut with glimpses of Paul's creative love-making ? for that moment we're carried away. Unfortunately, though, Chabrol's movie was about something else, which the lover and the adultery only led up to. Lyne's `Unfaithful' sticks close to Chabrol's plot till the end, but it constantly seems to want to be something quite different, something more like Brigitte Rouen's 1997 `After Sex' (`Post Coitum Animal Triste'), which is more embarrassing but also more real (there's no revenge, just a big come-down when the younger man moves on, and a tough effort at reconciliation). `After Sex' is about the wife's folly. But Chabrol's plot, which Lyne is closely following, is about the cuckolded husband's anger, how it can both revive and wreck a marriage. `Unfaithful' is pulled in two totally different directions, sex fantasy and revenge thriller, and it comes apart, while we check our watches. (`Une Femme Infidele' was far more gripping, and half an hour shorter.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story was underdeveloped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We went and saw the movie together, and both came away with the same impression. The movie focused too much on the affair, and did not develop what should have been a great scenerio after Richard Gere confronts the young lover. The affair, which was what the movie focused on, was impressive. And you got some idea of what it was that drove her in her obsession. However, we felt that what happened after would have served the audience with much more to remember than just steamy sex scenes and the the uncomfortable feeling you got from watching a partner destroy the trust and honesty in her relationship. We both however did like the ending. From watching some promotional interviews, Richard Gere said there were a couple of endings shot for the movie, and he personally liked the ending that finally was used. We liked it also. Anyway, if you haven't seen it yet, might want to wait till it hits video. And then, enjoy the guilty pleasures of the affair (if you can) and don't expect to feel satisfied when you are done watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know that feeling you get when you're cheating on your spouse? You know, how wrong it is, but how you can't stop? I wouldn't know either, but if I were to guess how it feels to be in that situation, it would be the exact performance that Diane Lane gives in 'Unfaithful'.'Unfaithful', although a very forgettable film (kind of a Richard Gere curse I think), gives us some great performances, some steamy scenes, and some disappointments. Constance Sumner is a very beautiful and bored housewife. She has a successful husband Edward (Richard Gere) and a young son (Erik Sullivan, from 'Malcolm in the Middle'). Her life is full of auctions, charity work, and school plays and even though she never states it, I've come to the conclusion that should something spark-y come into her life, she would welcome it. Enter Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez). One blistery day the two happen to bump into each other, literally. Should she stay or should she go? She should go. Will she stay or will she go? Stay, of course. And it's all bittersweet from there. From then on she constantly finds herself pushing away her husband for trips to the city to find her sweet Paul just one more time, just one more time, just one more time, until it she finds that it really is just one more time. Unfortunately, unknowing to her, Edward has been on to her the whole time. And he finally grows the, ahem, nerve to go and see this guy. As we all know, nothing good can come of this.'Unfaithful' is a good guilty movie, until about ? of the way through. I cannot help but put Diane Lane on a acting pedestal for her performance. She is so believable and so beautiful, I almost feel for her husband. Olivier Martinez does a great job making his character come off of the romance novel cover and onto the screen. Unfortunately, the as the plot thickens, my interest thins. Richard Gere is typical Richard Gere and the story is something to forget. But all in all, this girl's love of the steamy screen (and don't think we all don't love um fellas, I'm just one of the few who will admit it) will make this movie one to watch again. Only thing is, I'll end up stopping the tape after the first hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Acting, male and female, cinematography, direction just for starters. this is a movie that you love even when you wish you weren't in the theater. It is so intense, so personal, so intimate. If you have ever been a victim of infidelity (as all involved are)you may not be able to see it through. If you ever wondered how it might be to just see how life is on the other side, this movie is a must.Gere has never ever done a better job, his in control but on the edge character was perfect and would have been a walkaway for the best performance if it were not for Diane Lane. Her eyes, her skin tones, as she rides home to the Hudson River suburbs of New York tell the story all by themselves. Her ambivalence even in the midst of passion is unmistakable. She has truly turned in a masterwork of a performance and one of which to be proud.Even the small parts are pitch perfect. There is a scene with two friends in a coffee shop which will perhaps finally put Meg Ryan's coffee shop scene to rest. Wow! all three women sparkle and Olivier Martinez (Horseman on the Roof IIRC) is such a sexy bad boy, but here maybe more than anywhere else in the movie. Do not go alone. Drag out your spouse, this is a movie for couples to see together in order to recognize how much they need one another. This is a movie that we will be hearing from in 2003 come Oscar time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Diane Lane has long been a beautiful, talented, fine and respected actress, but few could have thought that she would get the opportunity or have the ability to turn in a performance as breathtaking as this. Julia Roberts and Sandra Bullock beware - there is another name in town - Diane Lane. Awards await surely for this fabulous portrayal, and she's proved once and for all that she is so much more than a very pretty face.Whenever Richard Gere turns out a new film I start to worry. Another so-so vehicle for the actor who's made cocky and blinking alot his trademark. However, with Adrian Lyne's "UNFAITHFUL" Richard Gere has completely re-invented himself and delivers a performance that may well be his careers best. He is so un-Richard Gere like and is very impressive indeed.Olivier Martinez could well be the Brad Pitt of tomorrow with smouldering looks that had all the females in the audience in a spin. A great looking guy who can also act a bit despite being in such illustrious company as Lane and Gere.Brilliant acting and a great looking cast is not all "Unfaithful" is however. This film is one of the most stunning, provocative, haunting, intelligent and downright sexy films I have ever seen. Certainly one of the best thrillers of the new decade so far. It has everything, humor, power, subtlety, great acting, great camera work and a flowing, hypnotic pace that really takes you on a journey.A wonderful film that is now Adrian Lyne's best work to date. Those expecting just a rehashed, predictable, remake of other infidelity thrillers beware. This is a stunning and provocative film that stays with you. Thrillers just don't get any better than "Unfaithful". Sheer brilliance!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film yesterday afternoon. This film provides a very detailed illustration of affairs without the usual reasons for having affairs (feeling neglected, financial problems, etc). That was the best part of this film - show someone who had no reason to start an affair and show what happens after the affair is exposed.I believe this is one of the best films I have seen in 2002. I look forward to Adrian Lyne's next film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a great storyline, good acting, with a great twist at the end. I do believe the climax of the movie towards the end when he confronts his wife's lover. This was wonderfully done.The wife should have known that it couldn't last, it never does! It always end up with a lot of hurt. And in this case, death for her lover. Once she committed herself to sleeping with him. It was over. Too bad she couldn't have gotten pregnant with the frenchman's baby. Now that would have been real interesting for the scared couple.This movie has the potential for a tear jerker, but with the cheating and violence, it just takes that away. Which I love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shallow and Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie for the second time last night. I saw it the first time when it first hit DVD. My opinion of it has changed.Not by much, mind you. I remember the first time watching the initial sex scene between Lane and Martinez and thinking, what the hell is that, that's ridiculous. Upon this review however, I get it. Honestly, as much as I despise adultery in general and especially movies that seem to glorify it, I kinda got it. People do it. It's not something I see myself doing, but honestly, life takes weird turns and who knows. So I forgave the movie for its plot. Which wasn't something I forgave it for the first time around. It just didn't seem to make any sense for her to risk her marriage and her family for this affair.But here is what really bothered me about this movie upon second viewing. Here are these two well-to-do folks living in the suburbs who get mixed up with this young, naive man visiting from France who ultimately dies and gets dumped in some landfill by the husband. And for what? His family alerted the police of his absence. So this poor kid (okay he was arrogant but - how old was he, anyway?) - who should have known better, but didn't, who had a family that loved him ends up getting murdered by this husband. It was just sad. Beyond sad.Pointless, really.Which sums up my views of this movie, ultimately. It was a trite, pointless, dirty movie pretending to be more than it was starring an especially selfish spouse married to an equally self-absorbed man who murdered a young man who should have known better, but who certainly didn't deserve to die for it. And neither is punished for it. She keeps her marriage, he doesn't get caught. Life goes on. No justice for anyone involved.And honestly, what was that at the end while they're sitting next to the police station at the red light? Are we to wonder if they'll turn themselves in? That selfish pair who believes the world revolves around them? Right. Give up the house in the 'burbs? The Mercedes? The Land Rover? The high-powered job? Gardening out front on a cool fall day in one's favorite LL Bean chunky sweater? JUNIOR LEAGUE?! I think not!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad start, great ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a middle class woman having an affair with a French student behind her husband's back. After her husband found out about it, the situation spirals out of control.In the first half of the film, the film is almost laughable. The wind is so strong in the city centre that rubbish flies around the whole place? And the French guy knows which things belong to Diane Lane and which doesn't, among all the flying debris, after they bump into each other? It is just so unbelievable. In addition, I think Diane lane does not need to expose herself to grab the viewer's attention. She is the sort of actress that can captivate us with her acting skills.The second half of the movie is much better. The emotional tension and reaction of the various parties are well acted and portrayed. The guilt and shame of the couple are so dynamic and real. I find the ending part touching. If this film has less explicit sex scenes, and more emotional drama, I think it would have been an easy 7, instead of a marginal 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Diane Lane undeniably holds together this film with a magnificent Oscar-nominated performance as the middle-class housewife who has a fling with a charming young Frenchman with tragic consequences.The first hour or so of this film does play like any stereotypical "housewife fantasy". Adrian Lyne, second only to the Scott brothers for slick visual style, uses symbolism from the outset as what seems to be a desolate and deserted landscape turns out to be a seemingly happy family home. Connie's initial "meet-cute" with Paul is preceded and caused, quite literally by an almighty wind of change...You get the idea. Lane successfully keeps the audiences sympathies despite her devastatingly selfish and irrational actions. Thankfully, she doesn't quite submit to his charms and fall into bed with him immediately - it's only after some painfully awkward meetings and phone calls that the first sizzling, erotic scene occurs.As the affair continues I found my sympathies strongly transferring to Connie's husband, played by Richard Gere, and son. Her actions become more and more selfish and the web of lies and half-truths begin. In one strong scene the incredibly beautiful Connie, turns down her husbands loving, sexual advances in an atmospheric bathtub, leaving him visibly hurt and aware that something is badly wrong. In contrast Connie has passionless sex with Paul in a restaurant toilet, when a chance encounter with friends prevents her from seeing him at his flat.Like a couple of other recent dramas such as "In the Bedroom", the film does eventually, and disappointingly veer into conventional thriller territory. It is to Lyne, the script and his cast's credit that the film remains completely involving as both couples secrets become clear, and they are forced to regain and find strength in their relationship in different ways for their families survival.On the downside, Gere is heavily outclassed in the acting stakes by Lane, though the chemistry is there which is important. Olivier Martinez certainly looks the part, although I did feel the part was underwritten despite his role being, essentially, a mere plot device. As stated earlier, the symbolism is a touch heavy handed, though the visuals are always attractive.Overall, a surprisingly intelligent and moving look at infidelity and it's consequences on an otherwise stable and comfortable family. Lane's performance is tremendous and the script offers an incisive look at the dynamics of the couples relationship as the affair progresses, and after, as tragic events unfold. Although the film does veer into conventional thriller territory eventually, the film always tends towards reality rather than genre/movie logic, and the ending is wonderfully ambiguous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Edward (Richard Gere) and Connie (Diane Lane) are happily married with a son and live in a New York City suburb, Edward owns a company and Connie is a housewife. On one windy day, with groceries in her hands, Connie is about to hail a taxi for home. Right there she falls on a young, attractive man with a pile of books. That's how they meet each other. The handsome French man, Paul (Olivier Martinez) turns out to be a book dealer. They soon start an affair. Edward gradually becomes suspicious over his wife's whereabouts and hires someone to follow his wife, which leads to the proof of his ultimate nightmare, leaving his life torn asunder...so one day, after Connie has left Paul's flat, Edward goes up, meet this young man and identifies himself. They have a short conversation before something unexpected happens...One particularly poignant scene is that when after all's clear, one day, while at home, Edward is playing the piano with their son, and Connie picks up that thing (that gift of love, that weapon of fury) which is a present from Edward but which she gave Paul as a gift, saying 'WINDY CITY'...and right there she finds that hidden message from Edward, and they look into each other's eyes...Well filmed, well acted. Heartbreaking and profoundly sad. Passion that breeds from animal instinct only lasts one brief moment, when you lose your capability of thinking twice. No return. Such a devastating state. Breakthrough performance from Diane Lane and as well as undeniably powerful performance from Richard Gere, which deserves at least a nomination.Passion is not a sin, for men and women are creatures of passion. If only it was not so twisted and tangled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie features two actors, Richard Gere and Diane Lane neither of whom can act their way out of a wet paper bag and neither did in this movie. Diane Lane plays the role of a screen slut and Gere her husband. The plot is very predictable except for the ending which viewers will have difficulty fathoming. In fact, the movie is so poorly written and directed that there is no ending so I can't tell you how it ended.This movie was made only for one reason and that was soft porn. It didn't need it to tell the story but we see graphic and sensuous porn scenes in which Lane engages in some unrealistic sex. Supposedly the redeeming value of the movie is that engaging in adultery can lead to bad things, which happens in the movie. But for hundreds of years great authors have made that point without graphic details.Gere's efforts to clean up a murder scene are pathetic. In real life, Gere would have been arrested within a week because he was so clumsy. But in this movie the NYPD is so inept with forensic evidence that they didn't have a clue as to who the murderer was even though there were clues all over the place.</fullReview>

DIANE LANE (The Perfect Storm, Streets Of Fire) re-teams with her "Cotton Club" co-star RICHARD GERE and she gives an astonishing Oscar nominated performance that is sexy, haunting and extremely human and sympathetic despite her actions. It is Lane's acclaimed performance that lifts UNFAITHFUL to greatness. It's already a terrific movie but Lane makes it a classic. The DVD is sensational as well, with a great picture, sound and plenty of great extras. 10 out of 10 for both the movie and the DVD.</fullReview>

Although the theme is really nothing new, Lane's superb acting truly conveys her character's mixed emotions - embarrassment, excitement, shame, giddiness. The gamut of emotions that runs across her face on her subway ride home after her first tryst with her lover pretty much tells the whole story of how this woman feels about what she's doing.

(One wonders what she would have done if he had been an EMT.) The other (played by the equally talented Richard Gere) is a paranoid who fires his assistant just because other companies have contacted him.

		<shortDescription>It would be a mistake for you to pay to see this movie. Rent it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Unfaithful, Connie Sumner (Lane) is the suburban New York mom with little to do outside of shopping and planning charity auctions. She has a devoted husband, Edward (played by Gere), and a well-adjusted, healthy son, Charlie (played by Erik Per Sullivan of Malcom in the Middle). On a shopping trip into the City, Connie gets caught up in a bizarre windstorm and literally bumps into Paul Martel (Martinez), a used-book seller with a French accent. Martel manages to lure Connie up to his apartment so that he can bandage her knee. He piques her curiosity, and it is not long before she is back again?and again?and again.Adrian Lyne, the director, is no stranger to the subject of marital infidelity, having directed both Fatal Attraction and Indecent Proposal, and he does a passable job with this latest effort. If nothing else, it is amusing to see Richard Gere cast as the cuckold. One big problem with this picture, however, is that it is difficult to explain why Connie Sumner would chose to pursue an extra-marital affair. There is no sordid underbelly to her marriage, and she and her husband appear to be very much in love.Could it be that Connie has gotten bored with the suburbs (even though Connie was the one who decided the family should move to the suburbs in the first place)? Maybe it is the result of some sort of cinematic karma, whereby Gere's character is being punished for the painfully abysmal Autumn in New York. Or perhaps it is simply the animál magnetism of the irresistible Paul Martel, who assuages Connie's misgivings about their affair with this gem: 'There are no mistakes. There is only what you do, and what you don't do.'No doubt many politicians and countless postmodern intellectuals would agree with this compelling logic. However, as the affair carries on to its inevitable conclusion, we see that there apparently are mistakes, with very real consequences for all those involved. Including paying to see this movie in a theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Utterly Depressing Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>See this film if you are thinking of cheating on your spouse and I think that theres a pretty good chance that you will change your mind. This is a film where no one winds up happy. I will not give away anything of the conclusion other than to say that you will not find yourself leaving the theater unlifted. There are many serious films where terrible things happen such as Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan. At least when the film concludes you realize that despite its depressing negatives, it was an uplifting experience and worth seeing. Not so here. Directed by Adrian Lyne, the film isn't a suspense melodrama like his previous exercise in marital infidelity, Fatal Attraction. It does have a few minutes of Hitchcockian suspense but thats about it. The acting is good and Diane Lane is a beautiful and desirable woman. I'm sure many will get a rise out of her sex scenes. I have noticed that woman seem to be enjoying this film more than man. Perhaps they can relate to it more. I, myself, will not be buying it on DVD. For entertainment this summer, I'll stick to Spiderman (no pun intended.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is mindful of two other dramatic films recently: "The DeepEnd" and "In the Bedroom." In these three movies there is amurder or accidental death and its impact on what seemed to be asolid, well-established marriage.What is demonstrated is the universal truth of the fragility ofrelationships, even when there is a seeming calm and stability onthe surface. Marriage requires fidelity, security and commitment,and few adults are capable on it in any sustained way.Each of us is lured by the prospect of adventure and risk-taking,especially if there is the promise of sexual fulfillment and thefantasy of secrets being kept. The movie shows the difficulties ofliving a lie and a double life.Most often, the result of unfaithfulness is disastrous.The acting is superb, especially that of Diane Lane. Richard Gere,though more passive, soft-spoken and laid back, is the perfect foil. The psychological truth is revealed that these seeming quiet andrestrained people can explode, given great provocation.The moral of the movie is that the risk of an affair is hardly worththe trouble, but there are many such movies, plays and novels andpeople take the risk anyway. We wonder why, each in his or herown way.The movie is nothing if not provocative and stimulating. And thereis no gratuitous sex or violence.</fullReview>

In fact I think the trailer gives the illusion of much more suspense then the movie has at any point. There was no suspense at all, and it was predictable. The acting was good, the direction was decent, but the story was crap. It was the same story of cheating spouses we've heard 1,000 times--a man with a bad accent doesn't make it creative.

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. So many glowing reviews of this film that I found to be extremely predictable and almost emotionless for such an emotional topic. OK, the subject matter is handled in a slightly more realistic manner than is the Hollywood custom, but still no real surprises. Underrated Diane Lane does have some nice moments of disgust and regret, but the two male co-stars seem to be little more than decoration. The little kid from "Malcom in the Middle" is there to make us believe that Gere and Lane have a wonderful family and life living in a dream home. It is just difficult for me to believe anyone would throw away this perfect life for lust ... especially with time to ponder the move. And I am a GUY! Director Adrian Lyne has quite a track record of showing the weak side of people. I think he specializes in this because it is such an easy topic/target. It is nice to see a movie written for the over 35 crowd. Now if we could get just a bit more depth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More than anything else, I wanted to know WHY Diane Lane's character was doing all this. I can somewhat understand straying outside of a happy marriage for a brief frolic in the hay. But to do it over and over again, to be literally obsessed with the object of her lust, to present him with a gift that was given to her by the husband that she still allegedly loves, to not be content with the sex itself but rather submit to the potential humiliation of getting caught doing it in public places, to lock and load the humiliation by flying into a jealous rage in public after seeing him with another woman, and finally to annihilate her last remaining shred of self-esteem by taking it up the rear minutes after the shocking discovery.... I am sorry, but this woman had some SERIOUS psychological issues that FAR outweighed anything that the film was attempting to portray.The movie would have been much more interesting and substantial if, in addition to all the sensationalism, it presented a coherent and semi-intelligent treatment of WHY a "happily" married woman would sink THAT low for a pretty face and a firm body not unlike a younger version of her husband. I was disturbed by Adrian Lyne's implication that the woman's behavior was "normal", and so we are expected to get over the "why" and just focus on the behavior. I don't think that sort of behavior is normal. Either that, or I am just incredibly naive and should adopt a far less respectful view of all women.</fullReview>

Here is the plot: happily married woman accidently runs into a guy on the street (literally), he seduces her, they have an affair, the woman's husband gets suspicious, he hires a private eye, he confronts his wife's lover, he accidently kills him, the wife finds out, they reconcile their issues and decide it's best if they all run off and live in Mexico, roll the credits.About as original as that penny sitting in your pocket.If you like Richard Gere, or have a thing for Diane Lane, or melt at the sight of a mysterious french guy -- go nuts, rent it, make some popcorn. Otherwise, you're not missing anything.After watching Unfaithful, I wondered how Diane Lane got the nomination -- it was hardly a stellar performance. But to be fair I tried to come up with other potential candidates from 2002 films I saw ... the only thing I could come up with was Nia Vardalos for My Big Fat Greek Wedding -- she got the writing nomination; that's probably enough for her. I guess Lane's nomination is more of a comment of the lack of great lead roles for women this last year.Bottom line: 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Huge Disappointment. Sex scenes are some of a few redeeming features of this idiotic and infantile film. Diane Lane is good in a pursed lip, conflicted, "ha ha I'm pretending everything's okay when I'm involved in an outrageous affair", kind of way. Richard Gere brings nothing to the table. I'm surprised that critcs have fawned all over this. The plot is soooo uninteresting, tired and trite. This is NOT a fascinating examination of infidelity. No.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Save yourself the time and effort of watching this. I cannot believe how slow and ponderous this movie was. The scenes that one would expect to be described as romantic, erotic, hot or sensual I can only describe as vulgar, crass, and obscene.At no point do you feel sympathy for the mess the female lead has gotten herself into. At no point do you feel any simpathy for her eurotrash partner as his fate in the movie befalls him. Richard Gere's character could be described as a sidebar. And for some reason this film was obsessed with scenes involving urine.And for some reason the director felt that if he made you listen to single notes played on a piano for minutes and minutes on end with no actor dialog that it would put you in the right state of mind to appreciate his train wreck of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have a loving husband and a kid who doesn't require medication or pre-teen bootcamp. Your husband owns his own company, so you don't have to work. Instead, you can let your maid do the menial housework so you can spend your days wearing cute clothes, shopping, raising money for charity, and picking the kid up from school. You have a gorgeous house, high priced vehicles, and the man you married is utterly devoted. In spite of all this you opt to get it on with some guy with bad teeth and a subleased apartment. Then you get psychotic and possessive about him, even though you have no intention of leaving your family for him. Why? Sure, Richard Gere is old and has beady little eyes, but he beats the hell out of most dads strolling state fairgrounds and football stadiums.I just don't get it. Maybe it's because I'm single with no family and no money and no Mercedes with a leather interior, so I have trouble understanding why it is that when you have everything, you'd risk losing it for some hot sex. Don't get me wrong, I like hot sex too, and the scenes in the movie almost made it seem worth the risk. On the other hand, I don't understand why in our new HIV world you'd get it on with a stranger and not just get a naughty book or movie and take it home to a husband who'd be more than willing to oblige.I hated this movie. Diane Lane looked fabulous in it, and you can't help but envy her body and respect all the effort she must put into it. But that ain't worth even matinee prices.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brief Encounter meets Fatal Attraction in Manhattan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder where did Mr. Lyne and Mr. Sargent live. Are they confusing Chicago, the Windy City, with Manhattan? Sorry, but as a native of this city, I've never seen anything like the wind storm at the beginning of the film. It's a very silly premise to throw the 2 would-be-lovers together. At any rate, can anyone tell me what was Connie Sumner doing in Soho buying party things that she would have been able to get (much cheaper too) at the nearest mall? It just doesn't make sense, as well as the rest of the film.Could I also ask whose idea was to cast that young actor Erik Per Sullivan as Charlie? I mean, give us a break, Mr. Lyne, with such nice looking father as Mr. Gere and a gorgeous mother, Ms. Lane, you would have expected the kid to be as photogenic and a great presence on screen, instead, we keep wondering: Is this kid adopted?In order to make the story a little more realistic, Mr. Lyne should have insisted in keeping Richard Gere's hair without the help of Clairol or whatever they dyed his hair with, because then, the film would have made sense as we all would have told ourselves, well Edward can't satisfy Connie and that's why she goes into the affair. We are not given any indication of what's wrong with their marriage since all appears to be honky-dory on the surface.The cliche of having a French lover has probably been used too much already and Paul Martel, the Olivier Martinez character can provide a lot of kinky sex and raise Connie's libido. Poor Edward, he can't cut the mustard at home, so Connie must go to Soho to satisfy her desires, oh la la...Don't ge me wrong, the film is nice to look at. It's a mixture of Architecture Digest with a Pottery Barn catalogue. Wouldn't have been better to re-decorate than getting involved with Paul Martel?.The ending is a cop out. Sorry Mr. Lyne, but are you telling us that crime does pay? Obviously Connie thinks that life could be a beach at the end of the murder!Heaven help us from another collaboration between Lyne and Sargent. Amen</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The stupidest, most banal piece of offal ever to be put to film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS Well, it would seem that the director of Fatal Attraction, a movie about a man with a fickle pickle amongst a bunch of olives, has "broadened" his "artistic horizons" by bringing us a movie about a woman cheating on her husband.The plot? Wife cheats on husband. Husband hires a private dick, says nothing to wife. Husband kills the second guy, police ask a few questions, husband dumps body. This is stuff for Made-for-TV movies, which is surely why I felt shafted (no pun intended) after paying the price of a movie ticket to watch a movie with a banal, hackneyed plot.The acting from Gere and Lane was (perhaps unintentionally) over the top, which in and of itself is quite irritating, although it does serve as a nice distraction from the plot (variations of which can probably be found in a few of those paperbacks sitting near the drugstore checkout). My particular favourite scene was Gere acting like a man pretending to be sick -- delightfully amusing, although that obviously wasn't the intent.The cinematography was thoroughly inconsistent. There were, admittedly, a few well-shot scenes, sensitive to the space and environment of the scene, particularly in the Frenchman's apartment. All in all, however, it left much to be desired, and there were surely a few scenes that could easily been reshot with greater attention to quality. Instead, one is left with a Sony HandyCam feeling.I'd recommend taking the money you'd spend on tickets to see this movie and instead go out for dinner. You'll thank me later.</fullReview>

You won't see it if you use the menu system to view the scene under Extras. You'll have to view the scene directly. It's filename is 0069.m2ts.Find the scene and convert it using the utility "MakeMKV" (currently available for free download). Now the scene doesn't end with the robot self destructing. After a brief interval you'll see Connie sneak in late after meeting Paul. She takes off her clothes in the closet while Edward watches TV in the bedroom. The scene is extremely provocative as she sniffs herself and her underwear for any telltale aroma of sex. Then she crams each article of clothing into the hamper. You'll see Diane topless, and she looks great! Remember, this scene only appears on the blu-ray version of the movie. You won't find it on either the Full or Widescreen versions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lyne's 'latest' film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared to other directors of his ilk, Adrian Lyne's résumé is extremely short. From his debut film 'Mr. Smith' in 1976 to 'Unfaithful' in 2002, Lyne has only nine titles to his credit. This has been a matter of quality over quantity: Lyne is selective with his material to the point of being overtly fussy, but it encourages his painstaking detail and thorough execution.As a prime example of the gaps in Lyne's biography, 'Unfaithful' is still his most recent film after eight years. The film seems an epilogue to his long-time focus on sexual relationships that peaked with 'Nine ? Weeks' and 'Fatal Attraction,' both major successes in the 1980s. 'Unfaithful,' using similar material, was also a top box office attraction despite mixed reviews from critics; it has pocketed $122 million worldwide and an Oscar nomination for Diane Lane's performance.Lyne had long admired the work of French director Claude Chabrol, particularly in his 1969 drama 'La femme infid?le,' which became the starting point for 'Unfaithful.' For years, Lyne tossed around the idea of building on Chabrol's theme, but left matters alone. This changed, however, when the premise of 'La femme' was expanded by writers Alvin Sargent ('Julia,' 'Ordinary People') and William Broyles Jr. (TV's 'China Beach'). This new screenplay gave the affair considerably more detail and told the story with a frankness that is only nowadays possible.The plot of 'Unfaithful' is painfully simple, yet it touches upon a great many emotions and sentiments. Diane Lane plays Connie Sumner, a suburban New York housewife who has been married for several years to Edward (Richard Gere), the owner of an armored car company. Connie has borne one child, a son named Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan), who attends grammar school. The middle-class family appears stable and free of conflict, but it is painfully ordinary: the large house, the Mercedes, and the shaggy dog look far too neat for problems not to exist beneath the surface.Connie is a former city resident who has yearned - at least in fantasy - for the bohemian life that Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez) represents. Martel is an antiquarian book dealer who plies his trade from a Manhattan loft. In striking relief to Connie's loving but dull husband, Martel embodies a raw, unbridled sexuality that draws her interest. Through a chance meeting on the street, Connie and Paul settle into an affair that is far more carnal than affectionate.With a husband and son waiting at home, it is only a matter of time before things start to unravel and hearts are broken. Infidelity is a topic worked to death by cinema, which made 'Unfaithful' a considerable risk to produce. Sargent and Broyles, however, tell the story from both Connie and Edward's viewpoint, leaving empathy for both characters. Tension also reaches high levels through the screenplay's effective plotting and dialogue.Diane Lane's performance was nominated for several acting awards, including the Oscar and Golden Globe. All three adult leads are very good, but Lane is the person who truly shines. Her performance is intense, nuanced, and without a moment's doubt of her character. Gere and Martinez are effective, particularly in a key scene where the two gentlemen meet. Lyne has done superb work in converting Gere from his usual grittiness to a more vulnerable figure.The one substantial flaw of this movie is that Paul Martel does not entirely work as a character. We have seen the French man of mystery a bit too often and Olivier Martinez is forced to climb uphill against the sarcasm that his character draws. Luckily, Martinez takes firm hold of the material and works to dispel the stereotype. It also seems that Erik Per Sullivan deserved more screen time as the couple's son, but he fills the child role excellently.Music duties went to Jan A. P. Kaczmarek, who has since won an Academy Award for 'Finding Neverland' in 2004. Kaczmarek's soundtrack uses regular orchestration, is unobtrusive, and effectively colors the given scenes. 'Unfaithful' is also the first Lyne project edited by Anne Coates ('Lawrence of Arabia,' 'Becket'). Cinematographer Peter Biziou ('Nine ? Weeks') has returned to Lyne after an extended absence and costume designer Ellen Mirojnick ('Fatal Attraction,' 'Jacob's Ladder') stays on board.'Unfaithful' is frequently aired on television and there are plenty of DVDs to get your hands on. The 2002 release from 20th Century Fox is packed with extras, including a film-length commentary track with Lyne, commentary from Lane and Martinez on specific scenes, 11 deleted scenes with Lyne's remarks, cast interviews, a 15-minute featurette on Unfaithful's production ('An Affair to Remember'), and an editing featurette with Coates.The film is presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) with Dolby 5.1 surround sound. Dubbing is offered in Spanish and French, along with subtitles in Spanish and English. Both the video and audio of 'Unfaithful' are solidly treated. Lyne's commentary offers useful background on the production, especially on why scenes were dropped or changed. The deleted scenes include a moralistic ending that was pushed by 20th Century Fox executives but later dropped in favor of Lyne's version. Decades on, adultery is still a popular subject for filmgoers and Lyne's newest project (not to mention Lane's performance) is definitely worth seeing.*** out of 4Roving Reviewer - http://rovingreviewer.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-constructed dramatic thriller featuring a stunning performance from Diane Lane.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>UNFAITHFUL (2002)THE GOOD:MAJOR SPOILERS--The cast all turn in impeccable shows. Richard Gere was great as the jealous but ultimately sad husband. But the star here is Diane Lane, who gives one of the best performances of 2002. She gave a compelling, daring performance playing an unfaithful woman ultimately regretting the sins she's committing but unable to stop committing them. Her best acting moment was the sex scene flashback on the train; her facial expressions and body language that show Constance remembering the love making session were amazing.--The interaction with Oliver Martinez and Diane Lane was so very real and I felt the connection between them. Lane and Martinez's chemistry was fabulous and their multi-layered relationship was intriguing, though I did have a problem with some aspects (see THE BAD). The most intriguing was how Constance began to 'crave' Paul and his love.--While the movie works as a drama and a romance, Adrian Lyne is also a natural in the art of making thrillers, and he shows that perfectly here. The scene in which Edward (Gere) kills Paul (Martinez) was shocking and very involving. I loved the haunting sound effects that blared over the speakers as Edward, teary, tried frantically to decide what to do.--The final scene of the film is very moving, bringing the married couple together at once and really giving us some depth to their relationship. The writing also suggests many possible outcomes for the conclusion of the film, but it was the right decision not giving us one because it adds that great afterthought I love with films.THE BAD:--I found this movie slow and a bit boring at the beginning. The slowness and boring scenes could've been treated with scenes or suggestions as to why Constance is actually cheating on her husband. The romantic relationship between Constance and Paul is terrifically acted but feels a little underdeveloped at the beginning because Constance seems only to be cheating because he's a good-looking guy who is charming. I would've liked it if there had been some actual trouble in the marriage that triggered the cheating.--Erik Per Sullivan is so very annoying, and the scene where his mother admits the unconditional love for him is very cliché and seen-it-all-before stuff.RATING:8/10 - Though it does have a slow start, "Unfaithful" remains a top-class drama/thriller featuring some terrific performances and great writing skills.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND:American Beauty (10/10) Cape Fear (9/10) A Perfect Murder (7/10) The Perfect Storm (6/10) Wild Things (8/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An affair by a bored housewife has consequences for her family that she never imagined. Diane Lane is utterly convincing as Connie Sumner, a beautiful forty-something who chances upon a young sexy French man (Oliver Martinez) in a wind storm. She begins an affair with him, keeping it a secret from her husband Edward (Richard Gere). To tell you more would give away too much of the plot, but just be aware that there are dire consequences for everyone involved. Diane Lane carries this movie with a strong, appealing performance that makes me wonder why we don't see more of her on the big screen. Adrian Lyne paces the movie nicely as it changes from an illicit romance to a thriller. Only the very end seems false. Lyne has a perfect out twenty minutes before the end, but inexplicitly chooses to drag things out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Look closer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the case of "Unfaithful", I think that a bit of background on William Broyles Jr. (co-screenwriter) would have prevented many people from getting the impression that this is a one-dimensional movie. The infidelity theme is a staging area for Broyles' use of existential metaphor. His quiet symbolism was more accessible in Cast-Away, and on that basis I was watching "Unfaithful" carefully. The entire host of characters is there: Richard Gere as the jealous and vengeful God, who punishes those who fail to give him their undivided loyalty. Diane Lane plays the archetype of a person torn between the old religion and atheism, which is personified in Olivier Martinez's character, a Frenchman and a book dealer. (The French Revolution was anti-religious in tone, and France remains secularist to this day).I won't spoil the plot with specific examples from the film, but if you're like others on IMDb who are "tired of the whole infidelity theme", then watch for the narrative constructs and you'll be rewarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but unsatisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Diane Lane's performance in this movie was nominated for a Golden Globe and Academy Award, enough to pique my interest and excuse to tell myself that I was watching it to explore its artistic merits rather than its titillating ones. It's no secret that this film shows a lot of skin, it is after all the tale of Diane Lane's suburban housewife Connie Summers cheating on her husband Edward (Richard Gere) with annoying Frenchman Paul (Oliver Martinez).The complexity of the husband-wife relationship was well played out because while at the surface there's nothing wrong with their relationship, it was shown how Connie had needs that just couldn't be found in her marriage. It was a little frustrating how secondary characters in the movie served no real purpose but to impose their world views on the leads, it was all too obvious and easy. The filmmaker also had this annoying habit of focusing the frame on inanimate objects, like he was purposely trying force visual metaphors.The ending was terrible though, as if the writer had run out of ideas. I'm not sure how I would have wanted the movie to end, but the way it was played out in the film was not it. All in all, the movie was generally entertaining while I was watching it but deeply unsatisfying when it was done.</fullReview>

I watch movies to get away from thinking about real life, not to dissect them and analyze, so if you are like me, you won't mind a few lame parts. I was simply hoping for a decent story, and some good steamy scenes with a handsome actor. Well, on that point, I was NOT disappointed in the least! This film's got some rather tingly moments of steamyness, so if that's what you're looking for, then definitely check out this film! I would recommend the trio of "Unfaithful", "A Walk on the Moon", and "A Perfect Murder" with the lights out and comfy on the couch!****SPOILER WARNING*****I found their reaction to Paul's body being found to be quite stupid and unrealistic.

BUT: Unfaithful is a drama, not a thriller.Having recently watched 'The Contender', I must say that I found similarities between the marketing of these two films. The Contender is also a good movie, but it's not a thriller either.Does it make the film worse if attached with the label "drama"?

So the first third of the movie is waiting for it, the second, dreading the consequenses, and then third part of the movie really turns out to be the most interesting because it deals with the ethics of owning up.... or not. This is not suspense.Ya know... i have problem with movies that try to better me, but, on the other hand, if this date movie gets the youngsters talking about betrayal and the consequences of betrayal, i suppose it's all to the good, if more than a little patronizing.Lane was nominated for best actress by the Golden Globes for this performance.

Lots of hot scenes demonstrating what she's missing at home, and Lane pulls it off with style. Richard Gere, playing Lane's husband, provides as little to his role as the husband, as that husband brings to the marital romance depicted in the movie.A pivotal event takes place midway through. From that point on the movie collapses into a morality idiot plot. If you rent the movie, you will note the event, and feel free to click it off at that point. The rest is garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting film, but hardly a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching Unfaithful, I couldn't help but think, "wow, for an American film, this movie is really really French." It had a real 'Belle Du Jour' vibe going (for a 'housewife gone awry' film, that is the standard). So it didn't shock me for one moment when I found out it is a remake of a French classic from the 60's. I haven't seen the original, but now I feel I must so I can see how it stacks up. Her seeming lack of motivation was probably the greatest similarity. In those great old French films, none of the characters who did dumb things with their lives had obvious motivation. You had to think about it, look for it. The one big difference I'm sure is going to be restraint or the lack of it. This movie is fairly in your face, while French films at that time were really controlled. Little was shown, less was said, which made you all the more convinced that there was something so much more to what the character was doing than straight up passion. My only problem is that in this film, their relationship is so in your face, that it would seem that her only motivation is that, well, Paul is hot. I guess I prefer to think that there is more to it than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easy to view, but difficult to accept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The previews very cleverly entice the viewer so I became one via a DVD rental. *SPOILERS* The plot is super simple, and the previews tell just about the entire story. The funniest line is uttered by husband Gere when he first encounters (book and wife) lover Martinez. Gere, who is about 54 years old and whose film wife Lane is about 37, says to Martinez: How old are you? You're so young! Martinez is 36, and he even looks older. So, Richard, who's the one with the youngster? You are. That windstorm which is not even carried on the TV news is so widespread -- from the burbs to Soho. And what a tornado it is. And Gere is not concerned about his rowboat or anything else nearby. My first impression of the son -- where did he come from? He does not fit into that family. He is cute, but he keeps making faces --Perhaps, the reason is he is not permitted to watch any television. And do we have to watch him urinate? I like Edward's reaction when he is inside Paul's wall-to-wall-books apartment. He is sickened by his wife's impression upon the pillow, but then he sits(!) on the very same bed -- too bizarre to believe. The gash on the head, Paul's look and all that dripping red stuff comprise the best assault scene ever. How real, especially Edward's realization. But how does the cuckold of a husband easily lift up, around and over the body of a not slender fella? Also difficult to believe are the shoddy investigative techniques of the police people. They are unable to locate a single connection or clue, yet some indifferent worker finds Paul, relegated to being a needle in a haydump. Are we supposed to figure out the ending? (One of the added features does that for us -- that is, if we accept it.) So let's see -- she has a whirlWIND romance with some cad in many places, including an empty bathroom while her friends await her. The husband reacts, and now he is supposed to pay the price? I'm thinking he in the market for a great big huge water globe -- surprise, honey. The best part of this film -- the exterior and surrounds of that beautiful home. *** of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfaithful, but not very satisfying.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My general feeling of the movie was that it was shot well, had good dialogue, and a few endearing moments (mostly between mother and child).The plot, however, moved along too quickly. Connie's sudden decision to pursue the relationship with her lover, given her seemingly "perfect" life in the suburbs was a little unreasonable. I think a little more friction between Lane and Gere would have made the affair more satisfying, and Lane's guilty conscience would be more believable. Edward showed very little suspicion before taking action, and basically took on the doormat position - mostly non-reactive.The plot could have been richer, the characters more reactive, and sex scenes could have been a little hotter, it was all over BLAH. If you're looking for a sex movie, check out your local "Skinemax" about 11 on Fridays. I think women will enjoy "Unfaithful" more than men.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best emotional films I've ever laid my eyes upon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, the plot isn't new. Certainly, there are a few annoyances within the film. However, UNFAITHFUL seeks to pull its viewers into a cataclysm of emotion, and the movie does precisely what it sets out to do.Note: If you're interested in a plot summary, read elsewhere. I am going to be quite specific about what I found mesmerizing, and what should have been edited.Also note: You will find a *SPOILER* or two in the text to come, so bear that in mind before reading. Thank you.What stunned me:the montage of scenes as the movie opens. I found each scene to be metaphoric of the turbulence in the movie. Even the simple image of the child's bike falling on its side immediately evoked an emotional response from me. The montage pulled me in straight away, and captured my imagination.the scene where Connie (Diane Lane) is riding the train home after her first liaison with Paul (Olivier Martinez). If there is ever a scene that perfectly captures the emotional upheaval of a married woman who has just succumbed to her passions, here it is. Within the span of just a few moments, Connie's face and body language reveal every single emotion she is feeling: exhilaration, despair, ecstasy, guilt, rapture, misery, desire, unrest (not to mention a million other emotions) all cleverly contained with a short time sequence. Lane's acting here is beyond brilliant and highly Oscar-worthy.the meeting between Edward (Richard Gere) and Paul is absolutely brilliant: Paul is clad in an oversized coat, his bare chest slightly exposed, making him appear fragile and boyish and completely vulnerable in every way. Edward, in all his righteous indignation, is expected to blow a fuse, lose a gasket, go completely mad. But he remains calm and steadfast for so much of this scene that I found myself on the edge of my seat- literally. I spent the majority of this scene determined that Paul would work his way around to harming Edward. We're given clues. 1) Paul asks Edward if he wants a drink; shortly thereafter, Edward is woozy (I kept thinking Paul laced the alcohol). 2) Paul glances at a knife on his kitchen counter. (This was, I thought, a blatant foreshadowing of the inevitable - Paul's murder of Edward.) In the end, I was stunned to watch the entire scene play out contrary to what I had imagined. When Edward becomes unsettled, I assumed it was from the drink. I expected him to pass out on the bed his wife and her lover had shared not long before. What I received was entirely different.the ending ...that never was?: Certainly, some will whine that the conclusion to this film is too "up-in-the-air". However, I believe it's an ending which shows a mark of sheer genius. Because we comprehend that Connie's and Edward's emotional tumult will never fully be resolved, it's befitting that the film itself is never fully resolved. Must we have a tidy ending to every film? I don't think so. I much prefer an ending that is realistic, believable and even...palpable. I can touch this ending. I can hold it in my hands and grapple with it...and not only that, I can also mold it the way I choose. I like that.the soundtrack: it is as emotive as the movie is ...the score carefully crafted to be the perfect accompaniment to the film. Plus, to be really specific, I'm an obsessed Radiohead fan, and was elated to hear a piano rendition of one of their songs.The annoyances: Certainly there were a few. Every film has them. The child actor cast as Charlie, Edward and Connie's son, is anything but stellar. First off, the child doesn't come even close to resembling either of his parents, and his cutesy, carrot-top mop and freckles do absolutely nothing to save his fate of going down as one of the most irritating child characters in film history. Further, we don't get to see much about how the mother's infidelity touches the life of her child (other than the quick scene where Connie is late picking her child up from school). This is a disappointment. If I could change anything in this film, I'd lay a heavy editing hand on this character.In summation, this is a film worthy of all accolades bestowed upon it. I don't think I could write an appraisal worthy of it, really. The film left an indelible impression on me. To me, that is what makes a film great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for A Blockbuster Night**Spoilers**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not the sort of movie that I would have enjoyed watching on the big screen, however, it was well suited for a blockbuster night. I enjoyed the plot; I enjoyed the scene where Gere loses control and unintentionally murders his wife's lover. The only problem that I had with the movie is the clean-up scene. As most of you have stated, it was truly unbelievable. I mean, the guy did a hell of a sloppy job trying to remove blood and finger prints. Plus, he wrapped up the body and put it in the trunk of his car. Being that the cops were sniffing around because they found the wife's home number in the lover's apartment, the couple became possible suspects. If the cop's had the opportunity to do an investigation, they could have examined the car, and BINGO-Gere's tail would've been busted. Also, when they asked the wife had she ever been in the lover's apartment-she claimed she had not. All they had to do was gather her finger prints as well. Anyway, I am rambling, because there was just so much more that could've been done with this but wasn't. Overall, I believe the movie is worth renting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lane's movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film and just kept thinking so what? It's about a woman who cheats on her husband. I don't really care about any of the characters. The actual consequences of that affair take place during the last act and the ending really sucks. So why was I thinking about the film long after I finished watching it?Because Diane Lane gives an Oscar worthy performance. Everything from little faces she makes to her son, or thinking about the beginning of the affair she's started with the younger man, she really gives a performance that acting schools should show as an example of how to do it right. Of course, Lynne's tight direction also helps, whereas a movie like "In The Bedroom" has fine performances but long, drawn out scenes that hurt the film (in my opinion). Here, Lane is helped by good direction, crisply edited scenes where no one overstays their welcome. Although the Oscars hardly ever give nominations to people who *really* deserve them, here's one actress who I think at the minimum, has the a worthy performance that people will at least know is deserving, whether she gets it or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dangerous Liaison!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Unfaithful" starts out with a seemingly happy family, the Sumners who appear to have it all. The husband Edward (Richard Gere) is a successful business man, the wife Connie (Diane Lane) a devoted wife and mother to son Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan). They live in a palatial estate in the suburbs complete with a Mercedes and a SUV parked in the driveway. Then one day while shopping in town (New York), Connie gets caught up in a wind storm and literally runs into a handsome young stranger named Paul Martel. Reluctant at first, Connie is gradually drawn into a passionate extramarital affair with him. Edward becomes increasingly suspicious and hires a private detective (Domenic Chianese) to follow Connie and determine if she is having an affair. He eventually finds out that his suspicions were true and goes to confront his wife's lover. The rest of the film deals with how the characters react to Edwards discovery of the affair. The ending is particularly good in that it leaves it to the audience to imagine the characters ultimate fate. Director Adrian Lyne gets superb performances from his cast. The beautiful Diane Lane is outstanding as Connie who has everything but takes a major risk in cheating on her husband. The scene on the train where she recalls her first sexual encounter with Paul is a masterpiece. Through facial expressions raging from guilt to pleasure, she recalls her earlier tryst. Gere, playing against type, plays Edward as an ordinary happily married man with no special qualities, whose life is suddenly and dramatically changed overnight. And Olivier Martinez is charming as Paul the young lover who seems to enjoy making love in odd places. I wouldn't be a bit surprised to see Lane and Gere's names included in the list of 2002 Oscar nominees. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful, sexy film that showcases the brilliant Diane Lane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many people have already commented on this film, but I wanted to add my thoughts as well.This is truly a tour de force for Diane Lane. You cannot keep your eyes off her in this movie. Her expressions are priceless, especially during the scene on the train where she is reliving her first encounter with the French lover she has been unfaithful with. She is lovely to look at, and she acts up a storm in this film. I hope she receives an Academy Award nomination for her efforts.This film gave me a lot to think about, regarding marriage and infidelity. As the film's ending shows, there are no easy answers. Adrian Lyne did a great job directing. The cinematography is top notch also. And of course, as a woman, I loved looking at Olivier Martinez! Richard Gere has always been sexy, but his character takes a back seat to this young, hot character that his wife falls for.It moves kind of slowly, but is sexy and suspenseful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the best of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think a lot of people expected this to be "sexy" or "erotic" in a way it's definitely not interested in being at all. We know going in (it's hard to miss, given the title) what's going to happen (wife has an affair); in fact the movie is very clear, all along, in flatly stating that this can't POSSIBLY go well. So why would anyone expect the sex scenes to be more titillating or stimulating than they are? The whole point is in watching the proverbial train slowly and inevitably going off the tracks, once she makes her fateful decision. She continually THINKS this isn't really that serious, that it can't really do much harm, but the movie knows better. Sure, the guy she gets involved with is the stereotypical French seductionist. OF COURSE. We have to realize, from the start, how obvious this all is - and how completely un-obvious it is to Constance. The movie - and audience - HAVE to be way ahead of her from the beginning; that's the way foolish decisions (especially regarding love and sex) always work. The last person to realize what a stupid thing it was to do, is the person who did it.I was particularly struck by the way there isn't a wasted line of dialogue in the entire movie. EVERY line means something here (even a seeming off-handed remark about the definition of "accountable.") In fact, there really isn't anything here that isn't specifically designed to serve a purpose. (I also enjoyed some of the humor regarding the use of an elevator, which I suspect was a nod toward Fatal Attraction. And it's wonderfully ironic to see Gere playing the husband, when 20 years ago he would have seemed tailor-made for the Martinez role.) Rated R for good reason (primarily some rather frank depictions of rough sex). 9 of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be Grateful for Zees Momeeeent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"...For Zees Momeeent eez your life!". So speaks the European amalgam of every older American's woman's fantasy, sounding and looking like an escaped character from the cover of a Harlequin romance novel. If this is the kind of character you like, this movie is for you. If not, you're in big trouble.The quote is read by the object of desire from one of his rare books to his latest conquest;unfortunately, "this moment" he speaks of, and several thousand more just like them, were my life for over two hours, but thankfully, I survived. (Though I did have to literally take a breather half an hour into the film. I had gone with a friend, or I would not have returned).The reason for the pain is the dialogue, plot, situations, and camerawork, all of which is contrived beyond belief. In the beginning we are introduced to Richard Gere's suburban family and life, with absolutely no feeling that this is a family or anything more than strangers occupying the same house. The kid says all the correct cute and pithy things cliched cute kids do, Richard Gere is warm and fuzzy, and his wife makes breakfast, but there is no warmth or feeling of connection. The dialogue is so horrendous it is difficult to concentrate on the film. The scene where Gere's wife and the hunk meet is the topper; just how windy is New York, anyway? The hurricane I was once in was nothing compared to the wind in this scene, which should have induced a general weather warning to stay indoors at all costs. Instead, she gamely goes out to go shopping, and runs smack into the charming stud who is carrying a stack of 20 books (none of which strangely are blown away by the wind), and she lands on top of him bodily to the point they can barely untangle their limbs from each other. When this stranger invites her up to his flat to fix her skinned knee, naturally she agrees (!), gets fixed up, and starts fantasizing about him after she leaves. We are treated to more pointless scenes of aspirin bottles dropped in toilets accidentally, and retrieved, again for no reason that furthers the plot.The movie is full of little throw-aways like this that I wish had been thrown away; an example is mom retrieving a huge wad of hard candy from her kid's mouth he can't seem to chew, and then eating it herself. Why? No reason, except that it is supposed to be cute...but it isn't. We are treated continually to extreme and pointless closeups of gas stoves being turned on, hot water being poured, etc., for no apparent reason other than it looks European, and it distracts from the movie. When the two finally get together as we know they will, the scene is anything but sexy, erotic, or romantic, but as contrived as the unlikely way that they meet. When she changes her mind and starts to back out, he practially rapes her until she changes her mind and decides getting raped is hot, hot, hot. This trend is repeated several times in the movie, and does not make for a sympathetic character.Richard Gere is the best thing in the movie by far, which is a very strange thing for me to say considering that I have never been a Richard Gere fan. But I have to say he does a very good job and watching him was the only palatable thing in the film.By the end of the film I had stopped being annoyed by Diana's character and was contemplating the mentality of the writer or director; (at least it gave me SOMETHING to do while watching it); which one of them decided to portray women in this fashion? Diana gives them exactly what they wanted, which is a confused, impulsive and rather stupid character; but is this way the writer or Director sees women? Look at their film history and you will see an interesting trend of female portrals.This is not to say that all women (and men) who have affairs are stupid and unsympathetic; it is the way it is portrayed which is offensive.The movie (I hate to say it), is unfaithful to its premise, and becomes a thriller half way through, then tries to resolve the betrayal issues in the end by...not resolving them. Again, how pseudo-european.One critic called the film "very French", but it comes across more as a ham-fisted attempt at being very French, and if there is anything more painful than the effect it produces, I don't know what it is.I would rather watch Battlefield Earth again *twice* than be subjected to this again. The scary part is, I am serious. The movie could have made a point about betrayal (and forgiveness, which is never touched on) in an intelligent way, but this isn't an intelligent script or director, and the very good actors and excellent performances are wasted, which is a shame.Two stars for me; Richard Gere's performance makes the two stars himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was quite pleasantly surprised at Richard Gere's performance in a role other than THE hunk, although he is a little over the top, goodie-goodie as an ideal husband and father. Diane Lane is hot and convincing in her emotional struggles. Olivier Martinez is more than adequate as the French lover: interested, but realistic, knowing the fire will fade. The story is rather trite and dime store romance, but the characters and their motivations are well handled to produce a nice tension, despite the predictability. Even the non-ending is predictable, but better than having the moral dilemma resolved. I don't understand some of the negative reviews and their obsession with and disapproval of the "sex scenes", which are not excessive and are integral to the movie. There is clearly lust, but well handled and very little skin is shown to produce the desired effect. It is not a soft-porn or sex film at all, just as Clockwork Orange is not a film about violence; neither could be made without showing the motivations for the characters and the storyline. Critics must never have experienced the insanity and thrill of real lust and the excitement of spontaneous sex in semi-public places. The movie works as far as I'm concerned.</fullReview>

Lane has matured her performance and her beauty is now affirmed with substance. Some suggest that movie breaks the moment Gere murders her lover. The way I see it...that disappointment comes much earlier. Most of the love scenes are slaving to cheap hooks, formulated and deliberate lowering the standards for mass appeal while the same time, Lyne is toying with sensual side, dimensional as early draft. What is the nature of the moment this beautiful and accomplished woman voyages an intimate concord with that young Martel? Couldn't tell really, neither could Lyne.A wind? Not a typhoon could resolve these shortcomings to provide intelligent reason, a note of true passion. So many unresolved fragments as if several opposing collaborators joined with Lyne. Instant romance without a hint of passion. But still, - at least the promise and exploration of what is yet to come when Gere faces his early doubt - builds some momentum, some interest and credible lead.But wait, even that is opposed as suddenly drama departures in thriller mode, when young stallion is no more! Dilettante and fragile is result of that attempt and Lane is no longer wedded with Gere, Lyne or rest of the story. After that, everything goes downhill. Instant murder "clearance" to again happy family seems to offer enough sense for Lyne to actually form such a ridiculous ending. Paul Martel is really a new prototype of mega looser. Endangered specie to be sure, looking at this logic.</fullReview>

But good performances keep this one afloat. They create an interesting blend of drama and suspense here, with wife Diane Lane having the affair, and husband Richard Gere wondering how long he can put up with it.I don't know whether this is really any masterpiece. It mostly seems pretty routine. It's just that it creates a feeling of impending doom. Also starring Olivier Martinez and Erik Per Sullivan (aka Dewey on "Malcolm in the Middle").</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching, very realistic portrayal of infidelity and how destructive it can be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very touched by this film. The way director Adrian Lyne shows that a marriage doesn't necessarily have to be in trouble for one partner to stray is very realistic, and makes the movie far more interesting because we know how much Connie (played fantastically by Diane Lane) stands to lose if her affair is ever exposed. Connie's lover Paul is played by Olivier Martinez, and I think he was equally fantastic. He just brought his character to life, and I think a lot of his appeal is largely because he's French! But he's so interesting to watch in this movie, I just loved watching the way Connie and Paul were captivated by each other. And it's all in the looks and the body language, not the dialogue. When you see Connie trying to resist Paul you only have to look at her to know what she really wants. The interaction and the chemistry Lane and Martinez had together was amazing, and for me it made the movie. Richard Gere is good and actually plays a likeable character, not arrogant and aggressive like the majority of characters he's played. All the characters are very likeable in fact, even Paul despite us having half an idea he has other women too and knowingly pursued a married woman. And we like Connie because we can see she's devoted to her family but when it comes to Paul she's powerless to resist. What I loved about this movie was the way that Connie and Paul literally blew into each other, and thus their fate was sealed. ***SPOILER!!!*** Meeting Connie ultimately led to Paul's death, and for Connie life would never be the same. It was a very touching portrayal of showing how one moment in your life can change everything. It was an accident, neither of them went looking for each other. Initially there isn't even any sexual attraction between them, which was an effective way of getting the audience to like Paul. He helped Connie because she was hurt, not because he wanted to get her into bed. Despite what he ends up doing with her we know right away that he's a caring man, but also too weak and selfish to ignore his desires. And I'm sure the majority of people have been guilty of that once or twice, whether it's indulging in an affair or having a sneaky chocolate bar when we're supposed to be dieting! I'm sure those people who've been in Connie's position would tell us that having an affair does NOT mean you no longer care about your family. And finally, the music in this movie is amazing, beautiful. The way it is used in different scenes is so perfect and just gives them that finishing touch. It sends shivers up my spine just listening to it. All in all, a fantastic movie. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film "Unfaithful" touched my soul. It captivated the human experience of love, temptation, and submission. The acting, direction, and dialogue altogether explained so much, even when the actors said so little. I guarantee that "Unfaithful" will be enjoyed. This is an amazing film. It is extremely poetic in nature, and I recommend it to any film lover. I am very interested in seeing the German version "Untreu". I just hope there are subtitles; perhaps seeing the images on screen would be enough."Unfaithful" displays Richard Gere at his best. His love for his wife "Connie", played by Diane Lane is ever present. The most touching scene I found was when he played the piano with his son, and his wife found the picture inside the snowball. The shot reverse shots between the couple said so much, even though they said nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't just see this for Diane Lane (possible spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lane earned her Oscar nod in this film in a very believable role as a bored housewife who falls hard for a sexy younger man, but Richard Gere is just as good in one of his most subdued &amp; intelligent performances ever. I generally don't like him in movies because he tends to ham it up but here he plays a nice guy for a change--with Martinez in the kind of role he used to play at that age--who is genuinely and deeply affected by his wife's betrayal. They have a lovable young son together and he is lax to lose this seemingly perfect family. However, the plot twist involving his meeting with the lover is just not very believeable and goes way too far, particularly the elevator &amp; car-trunk scenes. I did like the ending though, very thoughtful &amp; tender. I think this is the real reason Gere won his Golden Globe, not merely for "Chicago".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A musty old apartment, strangers having soft-focus sex, people getting emotionally and physically hurt ? it's all so? Adrian Lyne. While Unfaithful isn't exactly bad, it takes an all-too familiar set-up and goes absolutely nowhere new with it. An affair goes wrong and the least culpable character suffers the harshest fate. And three admittedly fine performances still don't leave us with anyone to sympathise with.Without any Fatal Attraction-style histrionics, this is just another rather morose and uninvolving immorality tale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the 70s, "Jaws" scared an entire generation out of the water by depicting the predatory habits of a great white shark. It was great entertainment and the first summer blockbuster. But shark experts around the globe concur that great whites just don't behave like that -- most of the time. What happened in that story would happen in real life only once a century or so.Close to three decades later, Adrian Lyne has used the same formula to scare the bejesus out of every married man on the planet. Alas, slutty wives are not nearly as rare as shark attacks. This is why this movie just plain made me glad that I am a bachelor. It's really not such a bad deal when you consider the possibilities!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adrian Lyne isn't a director brimming over with integrity. His depiction of women over the years reeks of misogyny and over-indulged sexual fantasies. 'Unfaithful' is no different, though the gender scales tip a bit closer towards the middle. His showcase of the female one might even say is slightly more respectful than from his past 'heroines.' And his middle-aged upper-class white male (Richard Gere) isn't such an innocent bystander this time around. The story is stolen and over-told and the direction, music, cinematography, etc., when taken individually are all pretty much paint-by-numbers. But pieced together around the centerpiece of the project, Diane Lane, who plays an adulteress wife, the film actually takes on a life of its own. There's the much talked about train scene, which could have been quite ludicrous, but Lane's facial expressions and focus saves it from ridicule. 6.</fullReview>

Gere is passing the test for being a looser, I think he deserves an Oscar nomination.Leen is exagerating in the train, it's sort of artificial, but the rest is fantastic, specially the part she washes the dishes. The French guy is exactly what a man like that should be,his speaking English simltaniusly weak and smart is perfect and his serving Vodka to his killer is played so well. The Little boy also acts good, his face helps him to show what motives might a woman have to be unfaithful.</fullReview>

Where would be the drama if Gere's character would be a brute or whatever. Imo a very clever choice to tell it like this. Lane is superb, Gere is surprisingly different. Lane performance in the train after her first intimate encounter is fabulous! As are the beautiful shot lovescenes. It's obvious by the way some comments fail to see the true meaning and daring way these were shot, that it had better left to Europeans. People from the US would rather see a head being blown off than two people making love. What's wrong with you people? Is it getting to 'close', to recognizable? Let it go, these prudish frustrations, and enjoy. Get into the skin of those people and maybe THEN you'll understand that there doesn't always have to be a reason for cheating!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to seeing this movie, as I had read all good reviews in the mainstream movie media. One of the comments I recall was something to the effect of "wow, an older woman can really be sexy!"Yes, Diane Lane *is* very sexy in this movie. But what's the big surprise that an older woman (that is age 30) can be sexy?? No news to anyone outside of Hollywood who lives in the real world. Other than portraying a mature woman as an object of desire in this movie, there is nothing new here.......for a woman about the same age and family status as Lane's character, the movie did nothing for me. I found it to be very formulaic and predictable at every turn except for the ending. As a matter of fact, the ending was the only part that I did find pleasantly surprising, as for once the audience was allowed to actually think.Yes, Lane's acting was good, but I would not say astounding. Gere was very drab, and what's with the kid? You'd have thought they could get better acting in this role than that. Or maybe they wanted it this way so that we wouldn't feel so very angry at Lane's character for forgetting her sweet son at school while lying in bed with another man.I would certainly not classify this as a "sexy thriller", but instead a boring drama about an unfortunate predicament that too many middle-class North Americans get themselves into. Would have played better as a made-for-TV movie in my opinion. If you want a *very* sexy thriller, try "The Thomas Crown Affair" instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*WARNING* POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD! As far as I can tell, Adrian Lyne had one hit film. That was FATAL ATTRACTION in 1987. That was a long time ago and with LOLITA being so bad it didn't even get released, he must have decided to simply re-work the formula from FATAL ATTRACTION in hopes of rescuing his career. Here is a formula for making "Adrian Lyne Movies". First of all, cast only good-looking people...no normal people allowed. No love handles, male pattern baldness or big noses or anything remotely resembling reality. In this case, we have Diane Lane and Richard Gere (Michael Douglas must have wanted too much money). Also, they can't just be good-looking. They must be rich as well. This couple must be related to the Kennedys somehow. They are filthy rich and neither of them ever really seems to have to break a sweat or even go to work. I think the wife is on her way to work (or a "fundraiser"...is that work?) when she is flattened by a monsoon but she is late to work so she just decides never to go back and it's never mentioned again. Must be nice and I want a job doing whatever it is Richard Gere is doing in this film...it's easy money for sure. He yells at someone on the phone and fires someone for no particular reason (other than to keep the plot moving)but otherwise never does anything. Second rule, hire only cinematographers with plenty of experience shooting shampoo commercials to give the inevitable sex-scenes an artsy look. Third rule, one member of the good-looking and rich couple must have an affair on the other for no particular reason. Fourth, there will be soft-core sex scenes. There will be not one but about 3 sex scenes in every Adrian Lyne movie I ever saw. The last piece of the formula is the ever-present, unending music score. I can't remember who did it but it sounds about like a Maurice Jarre or John Barry score imitation. The rich, good-looking couple is happily reunited and loves each other boundlessly only after the homewrecker is dead, usually with a lot of blood-spilling. Hey, it worked for FATAL ATTRACTION. Just make the woman the one to have an affair this time around. The homewrecker even has a New York studio apartment just like the homewrecker in FATAL ATTRACTION. I thought this movie would never end. Things start to look up after gallons of blood are spilled from someone who must not have skin any thicker than toilet tissue. My theory is that he must have been on blood-thinning medication since his head flows like a busted water main. A couple of taps to the noggin and he's pretty much room temperature and best of all, he just stands there and lets it happen. I admire someone who faces his mortality without question. He could have been a suicide bomber since he doesn't even flinch when someone tries to kill him. Finally, it looks like the movie will get interesting but fear not, unlike the reasonably exciting climax to FATAL ATTRACTION, this film pretty much just stops as if the filmmakers couldn't think of a good way to end this so they ended it in a really lame way. I was really rooting for them by the end too. I mean, they're young, they're in love, they're rich and they kill people. They're the modern day equivalent to Ward and June Cleaver except Ward and June don't kill people. Maybe they are planning a sequel...UNFAITHFUL 2: RETURN OF THE HOMICIDAL, RICH, GOOD-LOOKING COUPLE. UNFAITHFUL? A more descriptive title would either be UNWATCHABLE or FATAL ATTRACTION 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if this comment counts as a spoiler so I will cover my bases by saying, possible *SPOILER* ahead.The movie was alright. Diane Lane is attractive and did a good job acting. The kid in the movie was very annoying. Others have commented that there was no motivation for the affair. Since when does any one need motivation for an affair? Especially in this day and age with our "enlightened" society. There were a couple other areas of the movie that were unbelievable though.First, there is a crime of passion, a murder no less, being hastily committed by an emotionally distraught man and then "covered up" in a state of panic. Who were the genius homicide detectives that were foiled by Richard Gere's criminal mastermind character? Deputy Barney Phife and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane?Then there is the murder itself. The victim stands there completely devoid of all reflex and accepts two sharp raps on the forehead with one of those glass globes that you shake to make it "snow" inside of the globe...then he bleeds like someone had poured a bucket of blood over his head and dies. The victim would have had to be pumped full of Thorazine to account for his lack of reflexive evasive action and have an abnormal soft spot in his skull to account for the profuse bleeding and sudden death to make that scene remotely believable.Six stars out of ten sounds about right to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Making feature films is a long and tiring business that should really only be attempted by the patient and committed, and not by ex-advertising directors whose name isn't Ridley Scott. The problem is that in the years that pass between the conception and completion of a motion picture it is easy to become over familiar and bored with the original premise of the film. This is exactly what seems to have happened with Unfaithful, a film which starts out with promise of becoming a mature look at infidelity, but is then manhandled into a vehicle for it's star. Diane Lane plays a bored housewife who is blown off her four inch heels into French heartthrob Olivier Martinez. Before she can say pardonez-moi they are making love like rabbits on Viagra, whilst rich husband Richard Gere starts becoming suspicious of his wife's new found need to purchase sexy underwear.Director Adrian Lyne seems perfectly suited for this kind of romping fodder having been producing respectable porn for years in the shape of 9 1/2 weeks and Flashdance. However Lyne's first film since 1997's excellent, if commercially unsuccessful, Lolita is a clumsy attempt to regain box office prominence by re-hashing past glories. Nothing else can explain why the man has taken five years to produce and direct a film that is so clearly a poor facsimile of his earlier work, which wasn't particularly distinguished in the first place. The films script makes no attempt to develop characters and Lyne seems to think that showing endless extreme close ups will convey everything we need to know about a woman's desire for sensuality. While this style over substance approach is the directors trademark forte, here it seems to be done by the numbers, so much so that playing guess what gets cut to next is far more rewarding and interesting than paying attention to the film itself.As the gallic lover Martinez seems to have been told just to make himself seem as sexy as possible, a job he excels at. The same cannot be said of Gere who despite objecting to Lyne sending ice-cream and cookies to his trailer every day to fatten him up, seems to have been delicately shot throughout to cover his fading matinee idol physique. Overall the script is without doubt a low point for the screenwriter responsible for the Planet Of The Apes re-make, a man so inept that alphabet spaghetti forms more intelligent dialogue. The aesthetic pleasure of Lane and Martinez screwing each others socks off would have made for a forgivable guilty pleasure, but even this is ruined by a third rate thriller plot line that seems to appeared from a different, and some how worse, film. One can only assume that Richard Gere had got bored of the whole subject of infidelity and demanded something more interesting for his character to do. The change in tack couldn't have been more obvious if there had been a loud clunk added to the soundtrack. Unfaithful reeks of re-writes and tinkering producers. This was most notably reported with the films ambiguous ending, which was simplified at Richard Gere's requests but then replaced with the Lyne's favoured version after negative press comments at a preview. Lyne claims the new ending will have people "talking when they hit the parking lot", one can only presume he meant talking about where they left the car. That said the film has lost it's way worse than a blind man in a desert by this point and no ending could redeem it. What makes this is all the more galling is that the gaping plot holes and undeveloped characters are compounded by laughably obvious continuity lapses that stretch through entire scenes and a thoroughly inconsistent mood. This ruins a wonderful performance by Lane who is perfectly cast as the older woman drawn in above her head. She transcends the scripts limitations in ways so subtle and divine you feel she is paying penance for past sins appearing in dross like this. Unfaithful is not so much a film by the director of Fatal Attraction and 9 1/2 Weeks, it's a film by a director who has decided he is unable to do anything but Fatal Attraction and 9 1/2 weeks. Commercial failure and controversy can hit directors hard, and Lyne must have suffered a lot seeing Lolita go straight to cable TV in the US, however not even that can start to excuse this pathetic piece of formula film making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie because of the buzz about Diane Lane's performance. She did a good job, but on the whole, the film wasn't very good, mainly because there are so many lapses in credibility. Why would someone in Lane's position -- a beautiful home, loving husband, nice (if goofy) kid risk it all for rough sex with some skanky looking French guy? People just don't do things in a vacuum. And any man who was suspecting that his wife was having an affair would confront her first, not go to the lover's apartment. Also, the scene where Gere disposes of the body, in broad daylight, is just too farfetched. C'mon, this is New York City!Also, none of the characters were sympathetic. Connie comes across as vapid and not too smart -- I mean, she calls the guy from home, puts on sexy lingerie that her husband never saw before, etc. No one would be this dumb! And she doesn't even apologize to her husband for her infidelity, even though the guy is obviously heartbroken about it.The characters come across as rich, shallow, self-centered egotists. In the long run, who cares about anything these people say, do or think?(P.S. - Everyone raves about Diane Lane's looks, but I think she looks like a stick figure with a boob job. In her next film, she should keep her clothes ON!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Unfaithful" deserved more attention than it has received. Diane Lane knocks down a superb performance who is caught up in an illicit affair. Her life in the burbs is just too perfect. Gere does not excite her and she seems not to like the life she lives. An older woman being overcome with sexual desire for a younger man in a dank SoHo apartment is so opposite of her life with her husband, Edward (Richard Gere) that I can see how easily she can become so deeply involved in kinky and quite rough sex with this foreigner. Her emotions run the gamut of confusion, lust, glow and guilt. Lane's performance is Oscar-worthy. Gere's performance is amazing. Totally non-Gere. His life is perfection as he sees it and the affair ruins it. The ending is disturbing. Although the tension with Gere and Paul, the lover, is disquieting, so much so, that Edward loses his marbles and commits a crime and covers it up ---except he forgot to rub the door, elevator, etc. clean. Then I wondered why the police, who were so interested in the family being involved in the murder, didn't look in the trunk for evidence that Paul's body had been in it. Gere falling apart, Lane becoming so confused left me wondering if the marriage could be saved. Had Lane gone too far? Is Gere just too much in love with her and his life that he would commit murder and continue a "normal" life? Many questions are left unanswered in the end. Getting away with murder and starting all over in Mexico just left me up in the air. Now, isn't that great material for the police to look further? The house goes up for sale as the the family packs. Tickets are bought for some Mexican coastal resort. Their kid is removed from school. Until the ending, this film had me hooked. I loved the two main actor's performances, the lovely color contrasts, the contrast between suburbia and SoHo, the contrast between Connie's two lives---but that ending left me hanging.</fullReview>

Perhaps he has deeply personal experience in this subject, who knows, but it's getting a bit boring. Not even master cinematographer Peter Biziou can save the film...well, actually the cinematography is really good, and perhaps the superior camera work and art direction do save the film. More sex. The film needed to show a bit more. More explicit sex means the viewer will feel and appreciate how unfaithful she really is, and the torment the poor husband would feel. It should have had a lot more sex.And a few of the scenes were, for me, unacceptable and far fetched. I couldn't suspend belief for everything the husband did when he found out. I suppose people can go a bit crazy when their partners cheat. People are stupid sometimes. Its just sex, and a bit of lying. Nothing that can't be sorted out with the right approach, and creative, honest thinking.One more thing, there should have been more and better sex. It's not where you have sex, it's how, and they just didn't explore that enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a horrible movie. Diane Lane who is one of the most beautiful actresses of our generation is given a role that is so unbecoming. She plays Richard Gere's wife, who has an affair with a guy she meets in New York. Although believable, who cares? It's a self-absorbed wallow. The Robert Deniro, Meryl Streep movies of the 80's and 90's where they meet and have an affair are much better. A far greater movie is Bridges of Madison County (with Meryl again and Clint Eastwood).Richard Gere, plays a successful New York businessman with a Scarsdale/Greenwich type home. Once he finds his wife has an affair he cries. These types of people don't exist. First, a guy who looks like Richard Gere and is successful enough to have a huge house is guaranteed to be fighting babes off in New York, married or not. Second, no housewife from those areas would ever get involved with another guy poorer than her husband to such a large extent lest they lose every penny in the ensuing divorce. This is one (sub)Urban Legend that should be put to rest.</fullReview>

What an incredibly original plan this couple comes up with. - Lots of other stuff I can't remember now but thought of while watching the movie. What I liked:- Looking at Diane Lane I fully expected to enjoy this movie because it was well-regarded in an interview I saw with Richard Gere on Bravo's "Inside the Actor's Studio". Both Richard and the host, James Lipton, seemed to think it a worthy effort. But alas, I found it merely supported my assertion that it is very difficult to make a good movie. There are better erotic thrillers out there. Try Nicole Kidman's "Birthday Girl". I found it to be much more enjoyable. Bill</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director Adrian Lyne revisits a classic formula, a thriller based on the most successfully compelling elements of human nature.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film grounded in familiar circumstances, it doesn't really attempt an original spin, but it does milk the effective elements for all their worth. It takes what works to the next level, and if Unfaithful is anything, it's probably the one of its kind that pulls the fewest punches. For a movie to succeed, without the advantage of being something new and original, it's really got to go the extra mile. That much was accomplished in many ways, and that's why there is mostly positive reaction to Unfaithful. It is, for the most part, a movie that keeps your attention by slapping you in the face just often enough. The movie is effectively in the hands of Diane Lane for the most part, and she pulls it off well. Not until later in the film do we spend close to equal time with the other main characters, so it is her that keeps our interest. Her lover, the French book dealing gentleman who sweeps her off her feet, is the one element that could threaten to strip some credibility from the film, but he doesn't. His performance in the film is solid, and much better than it appears in the trailers, where alternate takes of scenes were used. Yeah, the delivery you'll see in those trailers sounds unappealing, but it is a combination of both material that wasn't used, and the way it was cut together for the previews that makes it that way. In the film, the characters are effective and quite memorable. What was most impressive by the end is Richard Gere's performance. Adrian Lyne was able to work with Gere to create an emotional performance from a character very effectively, and efficiently. Gere's screen time really doesn't compare to Lane's until quite awhile into the film. The only real downside to Unfaithful, and the only thing will keep some seats empty, is hard to avoid. Many have already made up their mind and they are right to notice that this is not an original concept. It's a common thing these days, to have films that are very closely based on an already successful formula. This year more than ever, there are some really good, solid films out there that are heads and shoulders above so many others, but also very similar to those same pictures. Unfaithful is like that, similar to many movies that any seasoned viewer has already seen, but it really is good despite that. The reason Unfaithful overcomes the challenge of winning us over, despite having such a recognizable face, is basically to go farther than its predecessors. It's pretty graphic at times, and doesn't stop short of becoming uncomfortable at times, in a way that serves the story. Unfaithful works because it so effectively captures the emotion of the cheating wife, the suspicious and ultimately crushed husband, and... that French guy. The feelings the characters experience are so palatable we feel for them, for good or bad. For the most part, there are no completely sympathetic characters in the film, which perhaps makes them more believable, and the story more realistic. So it works, and works well. Enhanced by a style of directing both fresh and varied throughout the movie (Lyne shows great range in this single film, using different styles as the story takes a new direction at several points), Unfaithful will not let you down; especially recommended for anyone who hasn't seen very many thrillers out there. There are plenty you can skip in favor of this one, and anyone who doubts that should give it a shot. Adrian Lyne has managed to capture exactly what was required to pull it off, making Unfaithful another notch on a belt he should be proud to wear. </fullReview>

There were some good scenes and camera work and a few plot twists which allowed a good build up of tension. The themes of infidelity, murder and guilt looked promising but failed to come to any satisfying conclusion for me.When the credits rolled I felt that the they must have run out of money.

		<fullReview>This movie is mildly entertaining, if for no other reason than the fact that Richard Gere is cast in the unlikely role of cuckold. The movie's fatal flaw is that we are never given a compelling reason why Diane Lane's character would venture outside of her apparently very happy marriage. There is no dark underbelly to the marriage, and Gere seems to be very much in love with his wife...not to mention that they also have a very healthy, seemingly well-adjusted son. I was also disappointed by unmet expectations: I was led to believe that there was some very interesting twist to the story...I'm still waiting for that twist.</fullReview>

I enjoyed seeing Richard Gere and Diane Lane together again. Their last outing was "The Cotton Club" and both of them have matured very nicely, thank you. SPOILER ALERT I didn't find it believable that Lane's character would be so stupid as to leave sexy underwear that she's planning on wearing to her lover's house out in the open for her husband to see. I also keep thinking, that if she'd just given her hubby a good time in the bathtub, he would never have had her followed... The ending made little sense either. The police would never have been able to prove anything without a confession, so why give up their lives (and that irritating kid of theirs)by spilling their guts to the cops? If that is what they did...we never find out, do we?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Unfaithful" was a film that we'd heard a lot of good things about, but we still were not that enthused about going to see it. Mainly, because we thought it would tread the same ground as countless other movies. Well, while "Unfaithful" is not the most original film you'll ever see, it is certainly different enough to be very interesting. And also, it happens to be very, very good. The film is a haunting and moody piece, that has a very sexy and cool undertone. The acting was top-notch, particularly Diane Lane who surely must win an Oscar for her faultless portrayal of Constance. We also felt that the ending was sensational. It's nice for Hollywood to treat us as intelligent, feeling and thinking human beings and this film did that, yet it was also very entertaining and gripping. A really well made and well acted thriller, "Unfaithful" is very recommended if you like intelligent, cool and sexy films. "Unfaithful" has CLASS written all over it. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

The story is familiar but with some very neat twists and turns. The acting is nothing short of amazing, and Diane Lane (who played a similar character in "A Walk On The Moon" gives perhaps one of the best performances that I have ever seen in a major film. No wonder this film is doing well at the boxoffice and getting great reviews - it is simply brilliant. I was thrilled to see a film show some respect to the audience with the brilliant ending. "Unfaithful" is subtle, steamy, sexy, cool, intelligent and engrossing. Yet it also entertains you and haunts you for days afterwards. Brilliant! A 10!</fullReview>

She had everyone in the theater feeling her passion, tension, sadness and all those feelings in between. The guy who played Paul Martel was gorgeous in that unkempt, unshaven way (and the French accent sure didn't hurt, either). Richard Gere too was quite good as the husband who knows and loves his wife but is aware there's something that's different about the way she's acting (he's pretty sure of what it is but has her followed anyway which pushes him over the edge). Not only is it about infidelity and it's consequences but it shows you a bigger picture of ALL the players that are involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is definitely not the first movie that talks about the relation of two men and a woman. Nevertheless, in my opinion, it is probably the best. Adrian Lyne had created the best image of conflict the wife lives between desire and loyalty, between the family love and the man's love, between the right to love and the duty toward family. I can't forget the scene in the train when she is going back home after she first made love with her lover, she was crying because she feels guilty and smiling when she feels the joy. She made us stand objective in this relation. Adrian Lyne had worked on every single detail in the movie, and the actors were amazing. Richard Gere did not speak a lot in the movie, but he did not have to because his eyes were so meaningful. It is a real masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven, uncomfortable, unrealistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS "Unfaithful" has some very good scenes, and then it has others that seem to be trying (and failing) to make up for that horrible bunny-boiling hackjob of "Fatal Attraction". I'd say director Lyne took the "shotgun approach" -- shooting in all directions to see what he could hit. When it comes to documenting how a "good wife" can stray, he does a great job. Mistake number one, however, was portraying her husband (Gere) as so Hollywood-leading-man-perfect. Handsome, considerate, adores her (and of course is completely faithful, we automatically assume), attentive father, even helps clean up the kitchen, for godsake. I suppose the director wanted to say, "Even the perfect husband can never be sure his wife won't f**k someone else." Sure that's true, but only because THERE IS NO SUCH ANIMAL. Perfect, handsome, helpful screen husbands really bug me.So, let's assume her husband is gorgeous and wonderful, but humanly flawed in some way besides putting his shirt on inside-out, and she has reason to feel bored or neglected, or irritated -- SOMETHING. And then she does something completely human, and gets caught up in the emotional undertow of the mind-blowing sex.Gere's scene at the lover's apartment started out great. Gere was looking for something to hold onto, some meaning, some explanation, and I could see that he realized that nothing was going to give him that. He would probably just keep seeing that smirking Frenchman's face in his clouded mind for the rest of his life. Somehow he needed to get the smirk off his face. Still, the murder was over the top. That turned the movie from a realistic exploration into a silly thriller. Now the questions become too many to keep track of. Not simply, how does an affair happen and how do people live/deal with it? But, how do you clean up after a murder, what do you do with the body, how do you lie to the police, and how do you live with the crime for the rest of your life? Too much, not the central point of the movie, distracting, unreal.Getting back to the real issue, one of my favorite moments came near the end, when Connie "flashed back" but revised in her fantasy the beginning of the affair: Instead of going up to his apartment, she managed to get a cab, and drove away, "seeing" herself make the other choice.Pity that Lyne seems compelled to give us the hackneyed story of adultery destroying everything with its obsession. Someone needs to tell the other sides of the adultery story. But that will require a wiser hand than his.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about betrayal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is an unusual twist to "Unfaithful". The trailers and reviews lead you to believe that the movie centers around a wife's meaningless betrayal of her husband and son, for no apparent reason than a childish impulse to have sex with a ne'er-do-well Frenchman probably 15 years younger than her. But when you reach the theater (or, in my case, pop in the DVD), you learn that the betrayal in this movie is much more sinister. It's the director, producer, and writers who have betrayed the audience, and the cast, with the promise of an interesting psychological thriller, and instead have littered the screen with foreseeable cliché after foreseeable cliché. The scenes aren't even original, until perhaps the denouement, but by then I've given up caring.The plot is as old as man's sexual urges. Woman marries man, moves to suburbs, has a son and a nice house. Woman runs into little French boy and is mesmerized, since we all know French men can bed any American woman they want at the drop of a hat, or a pair of underwear. Woman has sex with French boy. Woman feels guilty but continues. Man finds out. Man forces himself to confront boy. From here, the movie can take different directions, depending on which script the writers are stealing from.The plot is probably not completely predictable. Well, yes, it is. I did discover a new rule of thumb for evaluating movies: it's okay for the characters to do stupid things, or to do predictable things, but it's not okay for characters to do stupid, predictable things. If you disagree, run down to McMovie's and rent any one of the "Friday the 13th" films; you'll have a blast.I watched this as part of my quest to see all Oscar-nominated performances. Diane Lane was nominated for Best Actress, losing to Nicole Kidman's performance in "The Hours". I thought Richard Gere did the best job in the film, but Lane did have to create a character who would betray Gere, who looks about two weeks older than he did in "An Officer and a Six-Pack Abdomen", two decades earlier. (Reminds me of an episode of 'Columbo' where John Cassavetes cheated on Blythe Danner. You've got to be kidding.) You want to enjoy an Adrian Lyne film exploring sexuality and obsession? Please check out "Fatal Attraction".Roger Ebert once said that "Mad Dog Time" should be cut into ukulele picks to give to the poor. I'm not that clever, but I'd say rent this DVD if you're having a large dinner party and are running short of coasters. (For the record, Ebert recommended this film. What does he know.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Unfaithful" is a remake of the French movie "Une Femme Infidele." The story follows Connie Sumner, played by Diane Lane, as a wife and mother who finds the spark gone from her marriage. Then, one windy day in the city, she runs into Paul Martel, a charming French bookseller played by Olivier Martinez. This leads to a torrid love affair, and ultimately, an act of desperation by her husband, Edward, played by Richard Gere. The story ponders many questions, about loyalty, and if an extramarital affair is so wrong. Diane Lane puts in a fine performance, saying much in her facial expressions, and Richard Gere plays the part of the cuckolded husband adequately. In the end, this love story gone wrong will break your heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS---SPOILERS-----SPOILERSUnfaithful is a romantic thriller set in NYC. Connie and Ed [Diane Lane and Richard Gere, respectively] are married and living in a suburb connected to NYC by train. A tornado strikes Manhattan causing Connie to collide on the sidewalk with Paul [Oliver Martinez], a rare bookseller who could have just as easily been a terrorist. Connie' legs are cut and bleeding, Paul invites her to his apartment for coffee and Band-Aids, she accepts. One thing leads to another and Connie, in the days and weeks that follow, returns to Paul's place on a regular basis to satisfy her urge for a `nooner'. Ed finally figures out that the rotten smell he's sniffing isn't fish in Denmark and pays a visit to Paul. They introduce themselves, have a vodka, and discuss Connie. Ed then gets a panic attack and clubs Paul to death with one of those glass spheres containing fake snow. He cleans up the mess, rolls Paul in the carpet and tosses him in the trunk of his car, rejecting help from a passer-by in the process. Paul's family reports him missing and the body turns up in a landfill near Ed's home. The police investigate and find that Paul and Connie knew each other, and that she was in his neighborhood. The cops question Connie and Ed [who eventually decide to run off to Hawaii] and conclude they are not involved in the murder. Time passes and the movie ends. I swear in a stack of Oscars that this is the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me Cecil B. deMille.Unfaithful is the worst movie to come out of a major Hollywood studio in years. It's a 60 minutes soft porn skin flick, followed by 60 minutes of daytime soap opera. The only redeeming aspect is Diane Lane who is sensual, hot and sexy as she very capability demonstrates various sexual intercourse positions. There is a paper-thin story---partly thanks to the previews---which simply stops after two hours without a serious ending. The dialogue is weak and frequently incongruous. And then, there's Richard Gere miscast as a work-a-day businessman who's clueless about his wife and emotionless when confronted with her exploits. Give me Ray Liotta for this role any day.</fullReview>

The love scenes are extremely violent and uncomfortable, bordering on rape. This is one of the biggest flaws of the film, because it absolves Lane's character of any kind of sin. The ending was also unrealistic. The plot holes are numerous. I was looking for a film that treated cheating on a lover honestly; I've seen episodes of Law and Order deal with the topic better. It's clear to see what the director was trying to do: tell the story through the violence, sets, camera angles, and disjointed cuts. Next time, try telling the story through the script.</fullReview>

Lane's body is about the only thing to admire in this film.As for the ending, I only used the word "excellent" meaning it was "interesting," but hardly the right kind of message sent to the film viewers.

		<fullReview>If I remember correctly, "Unfaithful" was a hit, and it was mostly due to the word of mouth regarding the sex scenes; "steamy" this and "scandalous" that. And I'm not sure if it's the passage of 14 years or that I'm not Adrian Lyne's target audience, but those scenes did nothing for me. Make no mistake, I enjoy looking at Diane Lane as much as the next guy, but . . . I dunno, maybe it's that French guy that killed the mood.I was surprised to come away from this with as much antipathy towards Lane's character, though. Wives get bored and look for excitement, I get it. But it's not like her husband was unappealing. It's little things like regifting his snow globe and twisting the facts when she's enjoying another man; She's not very sympathetic here. So yeah, I sided with Richard Gere in this movie, and it was kinda rough seeing him played as a cuckold.It's not a very good movie to begin with, but it dumbs way down in the third act, once the Keystone cops enter the picture and the thriller aspect kicks in. I kinda like that it all boils down to a single irrational moment in each spouse's life that turns everything upside down. But you'll find a lot more in the love scenes than in the actual characters. But it would be unfair to slag the movie without mentioning Diane Lane's scene of post-coital remorse. So many emotions in so little time; she really did give a great performance.5/10</fullReview>

This movie is well written, and it's well directed also. The plot is intriguing and pulls you in, makes you want to know more. Richard gere is pretty good as well, not as good as Diane, but good none the less. I really enjoyed the script and the well written dialogue between the characters too. The sexual scenes were well choreographed and beautifully shot, they were passionate and well acted. The actor that plays Paul was great too, I really enjoyed his performance here, he was mysterious, sexy, and had a dangerous eerie manner about him. This movie does have its flaws, it's a little too slow in a few parts, but it wasn't overly slow to where I was completely uninterested. This isn't the best erotic thriller ever made, but it is pretty well made, and it's definitely well acted. 7/10 for Unfaithful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Go search 'The Unfaithful Wife' (1969) and read the plot summary.. except for a couple of changes, the plot-line is pretty much identical. After all there are only so many story lines, and they must get repeated over and again. This 2002 version does it pretty well (have not yet viewed the '69 film). Of course, it would have been more realistic for Gere's character to have immediately come clean, but the story had to continue on for another few drawn out scenes. The one character in the film that just did not fit in was the kid. Just could not come to grips with the genetics of a Lane and Gere winding up there. And the ending is a cop-out... they should have had it go one way or the other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to take seriously at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the tag-line, I expected this movie to be about a secret, lusty affair and a jealous, raging husband who takes things too far. The secret, lusty affair part is right, but, it wasn't exactly what I was expecting in terms of storyline. Which isn't' to say the story itself is bad, it's not, but the execution of it was hard to take seriously at times.First off, usually with these adultery movies, we at least understand why the adulterer wants to cheat. I found that the exposition into Connie's life was not adequate enough for me to feel sorry for, or at the least understand her. She lives in a quiet suburb, she has been "happily" married for 11 years, she has an 8 year old son, who is cute, but somewhat annoying, as boys that age can be, her house is in a state of disarray because of this, and she seems to spend her days... doing... not much. She goes into town one day (wearing heels and a tight fitting dress... to shop for "auction items?") and randomly falls into a *gasp* sexy French man. She scrapes her knee in the tumble and the sexy French man invites her in to clean up. Cue sexual tension. Turns out, the French man makes his living as a bookseller and offers to give her a book of poetry about getting "drunk off Life", and inside the book he has snuck his phone # in it, for her to discover while she opens the book one day at home. Of course, being the foolish woman she is, she decides to call him, and things escalate from there...Now I won't reveal any more details, but at times it is just hard to take Diane Lane's character seriously. I won't disagree that her acting is amazing, but just the way the character is written and her actions is just extremely frustrating. At times, she is a guilty housewife, a lustful adulterer, and a terrible liar. The only character who I truly feel for and believe is fully developed and genuine is the husband, who displays an honest and believable reaction to finding out about the affair (let's face it, obviously he will find out, who are we kidding)...But, honestly, this movie had the potential for a higher rating from me... it just needed better execution overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfaithful!So, as far the storyline goes, it's known to most, and yet, worth a quick recap for the interest of some. A wife, apparently well settled into an eleven years old marriage with a eight year old living proof for a boy-kid, busy and lonely perhaps just as most at her age and standing would be, steps into that infamous pit that society calls adultery. She bumps into this stranger one fine stormy afternoon, joins him for coffee, and thereafter for sex the next day and every other days thereon. Husband starts with getting an inkling, investigates, finds out, and then, confronts. No, not with the woman but with the lover. The confrontation that starts so well that it could even dig into the profound "why" and take the issue (no, not problem! Issue.) by it's horn, however, unfortunately, rather, turns into a murder scene as the husband loses control over what he was meant to do and hits the guy on the head with a gift that he gave her and then she gave him in turn. The rest of the movie becomes a matter of eventual mutual knowledge, that they know that they know, and of course, police. It ends with a note where a peaceful kid sleeps in the car backseat while the couple, musing over how their rest of life could be a beautiful escapade, both term as important, pulls up their car outside the police station and kisses passionately as the traffic signal goes from red to green to yellow, back to red.Poetic? Maybe. Unresolved? Yes.But, question remains. What about that bull that we did not take by the horn? Really, what about that?Why did it happen? Why does it happen, that way?Just the feeling of feeling special, that? That thing of being treated like not just a wife but a woman? Being told she's beautiful? Being awaited, being looked forward to, being seen off, being missed? Being treated like she exists? Being taken interest in? Oh yes, perhaps!Or perhaps, more. Perhaps, knowing that life holds more treasure than what 'they' hand out to you if you don't ask. Perhaps!No, viewer. You don't have to wrap it up with a certificate, good or bad. Neither do you have to play safe to just say, yeah perhaps.. but no, not safe! Not judgment, not wisdom. Not the trap of security; not the courage to break free, either.Just, accept.

		<fullReview>I thought Diane Lane looked absolutely sexy at playing as a middle aged mum. The sex scene's were really beautiful and romantic like I say anyone could agree with me on this? Also Olivier Martinez looked very handsome too, I say a lot of young girls back in 2002 definitely wanted him badly after watching this film cause I suppose he was good looking then haha! This is only my guess now, I'm not really into him. I actually was really sad that his character got killed and they didn't put Richard Gere's character into jail in the end. That was kinda disappointing for me since this is a 2 hour film at the end of the day! That's why I wouldn't give this an Oscar. They should instead just have a few nominations and then, it would make this totally reasonable! The actors were good but I wouldn't go mental with the storyline to be honest....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mess of a Movie about a Mess of a Marriage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a scene in "Unfaithful" in which the heroine, Connie Sumner, drives recklessly through the city streets, a bag of oranges spilling in the back seat of her vehicle. At first I thought one of the oranges would roll under her brake pedal and cause a wreck. When that didn't happen, I thought there might be some symbolism to the shot, as if we were meant to realize that Connie's life was running out of control like so much fresh produce rolling on the floorboard of an SUV. Maybe, or maybe it was pointless, like everything else in the film."Unfaithful" is the latest Adrian Lyne flick to hit the big screen (and now DVD), and it isn't any better than or even as good as any of his previous efforts. Unlike "Indecent Proposal", which explored basic consequences of an unusual situation, or "Fatal Attraction", which explored unusual consequences of a basic situation, "Unfaithful" is basic all the way around: woman has affair, husband begins to suspect. There's nothing here that hasn't been done a hundred times before and a hundred times better.Part of the problem is that we never really have a reason to make an emotional investment in the characters. Connie loves her family, true, but we don't really get to know her, and as a result, we never understand why she would fall for the suave Frenchman she literally bumps into on the street. Nor do we see enough of her husband to really empathize with him. We pity him, but that's a much less interesting emotion. Once the affair begins, Connie's days are filled with sex and her nights are filled with the occasional fear that she will be discovered and the nagging sense that what she's doing is wrong. Again, though, we don't understand why she began the affair or why she keeps it going. The whole thing seems to be based on sex, hardly making her a sympathetic character.Another problem is the direction. Adrian Lyne seems desperate to infuse the film with meaning, but he never succeeds. More than half the scenes feel completely pointless. The son, for example, has no significant role in the film whatsoever, yet his screen time rivals that of the lover. It may be important for us to see the innocent victims here, but in an art form in which every frame of film has to justify its existence, Lyne bogs the proceedings down with entire scenes that do nothing to expand the plot or the characters. Some may defend it by pointing to the realism of the scenes, but as Tom Clancy once said, real life is boring. If realism is indeed what Lyne was striving to achieve, I guess he succeeded.What Lyne does well is sex, and this film is full of it. I didn't realize I was going to be seeing a porno movie when I sat down to watch this, but with the basic plot and extremely explicit sexuality, I would have to say "Unfaithful" qualifies as one. Various positions, various locations, it's all here, and it's surprisingly graphic for a major motion picture, so be warned if you find such things offensive.The movie isn't all bad, though. Diane Lane's performance is excellent, especially in the train scene following her first illicit encounter. It's also nice to see Richard Gere playing a more insecure character than his gigolo persona. There's chemistry in all the scenes, and every relationship seems believable (even if we never fully understand the affair). Really, the only things that are truly awful about the film are the script and the direction, but those deficiencies are far too big for the cast to overcome. What we are left with is a well-acted movie that pushes the limits of what is permissible in an "R"-rated film but fails to expand any horizons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Java Man Reviews "Unfaithful" (rated R) Directed by Adrian Lyne Written by Alvin Sargent &amp; William Broyles Jr., based on a script by Claude Chabrol Starring Diane Lane, Richard Gere, Olivier Martinez &amp; Erik Per Sullivan Running Time: 123 minutes Originally published in LakewoodBuzz.Com, July, 2002 OVERVIEW Connie Sumner (Lane) lives in the cushy comfort of Westchester County with her attentive but preoccupied husband Edward (Gere) and their cute 9-year-old son Charlie (Sullivan). One day while shopping in New York City, she gets caught in a severe windstorm and is unable to hail a taxi. When she falls and cuts her knee, Paul, a young bookseller with an excess of European charm, comes to her rescue. She soon finds herself in his apartment, getting tea and sympathy?and just a little too excited. Later, she returns to the danger and excitement of the city, revisits Paul's apartment and begins a fiery affair. Edward eventually suspects that Connie has wandered and hires a seedy Shamus to investigate. When the private eye produces proof, a series of events are set in motion that are unpredictable yet inevitable.REVIEW: 3 Java mugs out of 4We know what is going to happen; the title gives that away. What we don't know is why. Why would a happily married woman become unfaithful? Her husband is seemingly not to blame, and there isn't anything especially impulsive in her personality. So, we ask, why? The answer is, it just happens. And, like voyeurs, we watch it happen.This film is based on "La Femme Infidele" (1969) by New Waver Claude Chabrol, and the French connection is evident. A typical Hollywood film would provide justifications and explanations for her infidelity, but this film simply shows a woman who knows that what she's doing is wrong but does it anyway. The events that result from her actions aren't easily resolved and the filmmakers do not tack on a pat Hollywood ending.As for performances, Gere is understated but effective as the hurting husband and Martinez is believable as the charming young book dealer, but the film belongs to Lane, whose remarkably complex performance should be remembered at Oscar time. If we learn anything about the mystery of infidelity, it's through her performance. But thankfully, some exciting mysteries--like a windstorm, the streets of New York or an affair--are left unsolved.Director Lyne, best known for Fatal Attraction, another, far less subtle film about adultery, has taken a more thoughtful screenplay and fashioned a sexy, suspenseful drama for an adult audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Faith in This Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfaithful (2002): Dir: Adrian Lyne / Cast: Richard Gere, Diane Lane, Oliver Martinez, Erik Per Sullivan, Michelle Monaghan: Painful yet well crafted film regarding unfaithfulness. Richard Gere and Diane Lane play a married couple whose marriage is threatened when she has an affair with a bookseller played by Oliver Martinez. Predictable and dark especially when murder factors. Even a visit from the police seems recycled and obvious. Adrian Lyne's films often address sexual consequence but the sex scenes seem more as a peep show. Better examples of his work are Indecent Proposal and 9 ? Weeks but this is not one of his better films thanks to its emphasis on being a peep show. In the first the sexual tension is high but not shown. In the second it is displayed in multiple variety to back its subject matter. Here it just seems like an excuse to place two actors in hot sexual action. Gere and Lane deliver on frustration and guilt despite being props for a dim cliffhanger. Martinez is charming and seductive and ultimately too abrupt. Other roles play for convenience over purpose. As with most Lyne films, this one is well made in terms of locations and lighting but its message might have worked more effectively had the affair been less of a peep show and more about motives and consequence. As a result it is more about steamy sex than the consequences of infidelity. Score: 5 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A New York suburban couple's marriage goes dangerously awry when the wife indulges in an adulterous fling. Connie Sumner has a loving husband, a beautiful home, and a wonderful son, but she wants more. When she's approached one day by a handsome stranger while trying to hail a taxi, she becomes obsessed with him and eventually starts an affair. But her selfish actions soon catch up with her. Roger Ebert wrote "The movie was directed by Adrian Lyne, best known for higher- voltage films like "Fatal Attraction" and "Indecent Proposal.'' This film is based on "La Femme Infidele" (1969) by Claude Chabrol, which itself is an update of Madame Bovary. Lyne's film is juicier and more passionate than Chabrol's, but both share the fairly daring idea of showing a plot that is entirely about illicit passion and its consequences in a happy marriage. Although cops turn up from time to time in "Unfaithful," this is not a crime story, but a marital tragedy. Richard Gere and Diane Lane are well-suited to the roles, exuding a kind of serene materialism that seems happily settled in suburbia. It is all the more shocking when Lane revisits Martel's apartment because there is no suggestion that she is unhappy with Gere, starved for sex, or especially impulsive. She goes back up there because--well, because she wants to. He's quite a guy. On one visit he shows her The Joy of Cooking in Braille. And then his fingers brush hers as if he's reading The Joy of Sex on her skin." Gere's performance was incredible, as was Lane's. Overall, a surprisingly intelligent and moving look at infidelity and it's consequences on an otherwise stable and comfortable family. Lane's performance is tremendous and the script offers an incisive look at the dynamics of the couples relationship as the affair progresses, and after, as tragic events unfold. Although the film does veer into conventional thriller territory eventually, the film always tends towards reality rather than genre/movie logic, and the ending is wonderfully ambiguous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Emotional Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are times when this film draws too much attention to itself with lingering shots and unnecessary camera angles. The wind blowing at the beginning is all a bit too unreal. Diane Lane is a good actress and very attractive. She abandons herself in the part and you really believe her performance. But why would she fall for this French guy? Was she not happy in her marriage? Does she have an addictive personality? I lost sympathy for her character, but that doesn't take anything away from her performance.The pacing of the film is quite slow and felt more like a television movie rather than something cinematic. I believed Richard Gere's performance when he confronts the French guy, initially holding it together, and then falling sick when he sees the gift he gave to his wife giving to the French guy as a gift. If you've ever given someone you love something, or said something intimate to them, and then heard it repeated by third parties who know all about your business, you can relate to how Gere feels at this moment. The twist of him killing the French guy is cinematic with the blood pouring down from this head.I think more should have been made of the police investigation where Lane eventually realises that Gere knows about her affair and that he is responsible for the death of the French man. This is the point when the film became interesting, but it was too near the end for it to develop. The first part of Act 2 should be contracted, whereas the last part of Act 2 should be expanded. The problem with the film is the structure of the script, not the performances.</fullReview>

Adrian Lyne did a good directing job in keeping the movie fresh and suspenseful, making the story eye-catching. Land, Gere and Martinez all did a find job in their roles, delivering some serious drama that showcase showcases each of their desires and vulnerabilities.

However Ed starts putting it all together.Diane Lane makes cheating classy. This movie may not work with somebody else. Never has a woman thinking about sex look so great. The story is basically a romance novel. One thing director Adrian Lyne knows about is how to class up some sexual ugliness. The use of classical piano almost makes the audience root for the cheaters. I am less certain about the on-the-nose Olivier Martinez, but the appealing Diane Lane makes up for any deficiencies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So if you're looking for a way to burn a couple hours on a lazy day, I guess having this in as background noise is a good reason to watch it.Otherwise, it's a fairly lukewarm made-for-TV style drama that I wouldn't recommend carving out any time to watch it intently.The acting is good and there's plenty of chemistry, but the story line on the other hand is terribly cliché and the characters aren't well written. It is almost insulting in simplicity as an SUV-driving soccer mom bored with her life finds extracurricular romance in a french guy with an accent. You can find the same synopsis in any mass produced paperback romance.Human relationships, being complex as they are, require more than just the "girl cheats on guy, guy gets revenge" to make a good movie. You don't really know why she cheated, other than the vague guess that her husband has just gotten too comfortable and has taken her for granted.It is also perplexing how the husband acts so mild mannered and blasé about his marriage every other day beforehand, but then becomes unstable and murders the other man. The scene is excellently played out, but inconsistent with his overall character.If I were to re-do this movie, I would pay less attention to the sexual encounters and more attention to the dynamics between the two main characters and maybe do some exploration on Paul's motivations for not caring that his girlfriend is married.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A marital cop out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a seemingly satisfied housewife Connie Summer (Diane Lane) becomes maddenly enticed with a much younger antique book-dealer Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez), she unwittingly falls into a full-fledged romance, losing herself in the adventure and lack of rules. Unbeknownst to her loving husband Ed (Richard Gere) she starts leading a double life, one that requires definite resolution, before the secret comes out.Director Adrian Lyne returns to what gave him his widespread fame: the issues of marital relationships and sexual desires. Featuring various forms of infidelity and its consequences in "Indecent Proposal" or "Fatal Attraction", Lyne ventures back into the underbelly of marriage. With limited success. Discarding the obvious focus is placed on female adultery. Here Diane Lane is captivating, turning from an ordinary housewife into a released lascivious sexual animal. Together with Oliver Martinez the tension lingers, creating a forceful sensuality, that carries the picture well.Build-up is where Adrian Lyne seems to work best, as he construes the misguided extramarital affair and slowly undercuts its repercussions on family life, ever more destructive when the circle of people aware of the situation widens, finally reaching reaching Ed's attention.However from then on in "Unfaithful" cop outs in a similar manner to that of "Fatal Attraction", however the latter only takes an easy misguided detour in the final resolution, whilst the former is skewed from half-way in. In a moment of crazed anger Ed confronts and reactively murders Paul Martel, hence taking away the weight of blame from Connie and introducing a much heavier burden of guilt, which takes the movie away from any sensible denouement. The reasons behind Connie's indiscretion are then discarded, glossed over, as she pieces together the fate of her lover and attempts in solidarity to protect her husband. The final confrontation is pointless having almost no emotional pull, steering itself down the cliff of 'I cheated on you, you murdered him, we're both guilty, so let's forget about it and love each other'. La-di-da...The ultimate question of whether or not Ed gives himself up to the police is utterly meaningless, used basically as a tool to give the movie some sense of closure. Essentially a movie unsure of whether it wants to be a thriller with little intent of commentary or a more deeply throughout analysis of infidelity. All the more fault is placed with an absolute lack of motivation behind the affair, apart from a lunging jump into lust, as Richard Gere's character is an almost idyllic husband.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really love this movie--not quite as much as Fatal Attraction, which is one of my all time favorite suspense/consequences movies, but close. As usual, Adrian Lyne focuses on suburban and marital boredom to show the consequences of an extramarital affair, and the results are dark and disturbing. You know from the beginning that all will not end well. I think my favorite part of the movie is the focus on Richard Gere's character, and how he slowly realizes that his wife is cheating on him and how he deals with it. I think he realizes how much he loves her and values the marriage and the scene between him and Martel is probably one of the most realistic. It is Gere's character sees the snow globe in Martel's bedroom and imagines the lovemaking there that he finally totally cracks and takes an action that will change his family's life forever. Although I love Diane Lane and think she did a great job with her part, I did not think her character was developed quite as well. The meeting between her and Martel was not believable to me. I don't think any woman by herself in NYC would willingly go into a stranger's apartment-no matter how cute and nonthreatening the man might seem. I did not believe that she would actually have an affair either, but if you put those 2 issues to the side, the film is easy to watch over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Performances Save The Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfaithful is a film directed by Adrian Lyne.It features Richard Gere, Diane Lane and Olivier Martinez. It tells about a couple living in suburban New York City whose marriage goes dangerously awry when the wife indulges in an adulterous fling with a stranger she encounters by chance in Manhattan.The screenplay was adapted by Alvin Sargent and William Broyles Jr. from the French film,The Unfaithful Wife. Connie (Lane) leaves her suburban home on an errand, venturing into Manhattan during a wicked windstorm. On a trash-strewn Soho street, she literally runs into Paul Martel (Martinez), a handsome young Frenchman carrying a huge stack of books. Connie has a bad scrape on her knee, and is unable to get a cab, so Paul invites her up to his apartment. Paul is quietly flirtatious as he gives Connie some ice and a bandage for her knee. Connie phones home and explains to her son, Charlie, that she's running late. Before she leaves, Paul gives her a book of Persian poetry. She mentions the encounter in passing to Edward (Gere), her husband, but it's clear that she's obsessing about Paul, and soon she's back in the city, with a pretext for calling him up. Soon, they are lovers, and they grow bolder and bolder in their passion. Edward begins to suspect, and eventually gets a private investigator to follow Connie. His worst fears confirmed, Edward decides to confront Paul, a decision that will come to haunt him.Unfaithful elevates the film because of the solid performance of the cast especially Diane Lane.While the screenplay may have been said to be recycled plots especially with adultery genres and adds nothing new to this type of films,the performances saves the film from mediocrity.Also,the resolution between the marital strife between Connie and Edward is something that would be far from satisfying. It seems that Lyne never learned from making Fatal Attraction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It happens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movies to be a brilliant movie depicting a betrayal. Diane Lane has given a fabulous performance in this movie. It is one of my favorite movies. Connie is supposedly happy but does fall into an affair. Movie was able to convince its audience that this can happen and that is its biggest strength. Love scenes in this movie are erotic and memorable. Richard Gere gives a muted performance of husband that has been betrayed. Paul Martel was very convincing as a charming French boy/man who seduces women and gives them pleasure. Even the young boy of Connie was good. Movie slows down and meanders to a not so well defined ending in the last twenty minutes but that is part of its charm. Audience is left to wonder about what will happen and that in itself is perfect ending. Loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's your partner right now?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Would you jump at the chance of having a sex-based fling on the side if your romance was dwindling with your established spouse? That's just what UK director Adrian Lyne stirred up heated conversations about with his go at another erotic thriller back in 2002. "Indecent Proposal" gave away the million dollar question with feelings of resentment, "Lolita" hinted at regressive middle aged men and impulsive nymphets, and "Unfaithful" looks at the human relationship again this time through the eyes of the average couple with one kid, house and their priorities in order. Quite possibly your everything's-fine neighbor or the employee-of-the-month person next to you at work.Little did you know that being a mature, hard-working individual wasn't always enough, but letting out the inner Casanova or Don Juan once in a while, with irresistible accent and all, to spice up your unspontaneous life might be, or possibly might not be, all it takes. Though that's just what temptations and deeper, reflective feelings are all about: sometimes they're impossible to resist and can eventually turn self-destructive if left unchecked. Can I go through with it? Is this what I really want? What if I get caught? All questions that might or might not go through one's head depending on which road is chosen. It's a can of worms that some leave unopened, while others attempt to handle the growing mess from their in-the-now, overpowering desires."Unfaithful" makes you feel like you're there as you get to see little, realistic details that are usually glossed over in the typical hot and steamy stimulating film. It also takes on different angles about the provoking question. Essentially it isn't a thunder-storming morality story where everything is shadowed and grim with hovering dark clouds wherever it roams. A viewer gets a tone from a drama on the surface but also tads of light fun and humor at points, though most importantly real characters reveal themselves during the expertly paced and shot film that's capable of hinting at hidden meanings even when words aren't spoken.

		<shortDescription>Lane gives a 2 hour acting lesson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Diane Lane. Wow. She's magnificent! I just rewatched the film (which grew on me this time too), and I absolutely fell under her spell. She gave a two hour acting lesson on how to earn an Oscar nomination without any real Oscar scene. Something Vera Farmiga and Rachel Weisz have mastered with their nominated performances. I didn't think she deserved her nomination before, but now, she's my #3 in the best year for leading ladies of the decade, the two ahead of her in my all-time lineups, so that says a lot). She'd be my second choice for the Oscar, behind my actual winner, Kidman. The film really is unique in the way it takes what was step up to look like a clichéd story and made it original. It's not really a thriller, it's a well-executed drama. The textured and dry photography made everything feel real, and that's what's great about it. This is a story, minus two huge flaws: Paul's death and the cop-out ending, is authentic and not dramatized and manipulated into (like I said before) a cliché. Roger Ebert describes it very well in his video review with Richard Roeper; she chooses to this lover not because she's forced or unhappy with her marriage, she and Gere have a happy marriage. Gere was also very good, his best performance after Chicago and Pretty Woman, I'd say. His reaction, to his wife's affair, especially when he meets Paul is played very well by him. Both Gere and Lane show their range as the film goes on. I also really was fascinated by the editing in the train station/after the first time they have intercourse. Lane adds a lot of power into it; it's probably her best scene in the film, but the editor really achieved something there. Very good pacing, too.Through everything good, it has many flaws under it's belt, as well. The two I mentioned before stick out like sore thumbs. What I think the filmmakers were going for here was a realistic portrayal of an affair, but then when they killed off Paul....it broke it's perfect score, up until that point. It was horrible turn. I didn't believe for a second Edward would have killed him. After the play scene, where the body is in Edward's car, after all that, it's picks itself back up and continues with what it was aiming for in the first hour. Now, the scene where Lane's burning the photographs was excellent and their conclusion of the situation. It should've ended with them dancing, the last shot before they were in the car driving home. It should've just faded out. The film would've been worth at least 9 if it would've just ended there, because the next scene was unsatisfying. Their final decision was pretty bad. It really leaves a bad memory in the viewer's mind of the entire film because it's the last thing they see from the film. It would've been so much more powerful if they would've cut that scene completely.Still Lane is remarkable, and she's reason enough to see it. I gave it a 6 my first time through, now it's an 8-8.5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Superb Film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapted from the French film 'La Femme infid?le' by Claude Chabrol, Adrian Lyne's 'Unfaithful' is a superb film, that exposes adultery to the optimum. Lyne who has earlier made films on the same genre, erotic sexual thrillers, brings a memorable thriller.I had seen 'Unfaithful' long ago, back in 2003/4, but then I was least interested in the film. But after watching the film after a long time, I Loved It! I matured as a cine-goer, and that's why I understood Lyne's execution. About a couple living in the suburbs of New York whose marriage goes dangerously awry when she indulges in an adulterous fling with a stranger she randomly encounters in Manhattan. This is the plot Lyne chooses to arouse, shake and break you once the film reaches it's finale.Sadly, The Sex Scenes in this film have been a major success, rather than the film. Sure the sequences are beautifully executed, but 'Unfaithful' is more than an adulterous fling! It's about the guilt, greed, and realization!Lyne's has directed the film brilliantly. Plus, his understanding to this complicated story is intact from start to end. Alvin Sargent &amp; William Broyles Jr's adapted screenplay is another plus-point. Music by Jan A. P. Kaczmarek is perfect.In the acting department, Diane Lane is the life of 'Unfaithful'. The Cult-Star gives herself completely to the character and delivers, a memorable, sensitive performance. Undoubtedly, Her finest performance to date. Richard Gere is fantastic as the shattered husband. The veteran is subdued when needed, and historic when needed. A stellar performance! Olivier Martinez is superb. He oozes sexuality, and looks the part to the T. Erik Per Sullivan stands out as the couple's lone kid. On the whole, 'Unfaithful' is a superb film in all respects. Move over the Sex Scenes for a while, and watch this Masterstroke entirely! From this writer, Two Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capably Executed, very erotic, Adult-Themed Story with a Terrible Flaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Diane Lane, a lovely brown-eyed blond, makes this flick sizzle, especially when she recalls her first sexual encounter with her new French lover and we watch her quiver at his touch. She's doin' wrong, she knows it, she feels guilty and all distraught over it, yet her body WANTS it bad! Apparently her husband, Mr. SUCCESS, is no longer inspiring her in the sack. He seems used to getting his way and strikes fear in the hearts of anyone who might cross him, so how come he comes up short in the romance department? This is a movie for adults and the heat of the passionate affair is aptly portrayed. Just as convincing are Richard Gere's suspicions, his discovery of his wife's betrayal, and his barely contained rage over it ("I don't feel well.") What really bogs this otherwise good movie down, however, is the excessive inclusion of their son, who for some odd reason has become their very reason for living. The way middle class family types moon over their children and expect everyone else to be similarly affected is too often both silly and sickening. You see the nice kids who really are cute and well-behaved, and then there are the others, not nearly so cute and possibly downright annoying. Unfortunately, it is usually their parents who are unable to distinguish between the two sorts. This odd looking brat has a head shaped like the tip of a missile. He has far too much to say and is in way too many scenes. In my opinion, he should have been edited out of the flick as much as possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most disturbing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...to experience 'again' the ambiguisnesses of Hollywood film-making; why must a murder be the only way of driving on the plot of a HW movie? And why must a promising portrayal of the mind-and-body-wrenching emotions of a mature love affair be turned into biblical female guilt? I was on the brinch of turning off my TV when Geres character made the 'inevetable' killing-in-affect revenge, but had to see where Diane Lane would go with HER character. The plot was ruined(by crime-and-police and female sexual role stereotyping elements=guilt), but both Gere and Lane made wonderful performances within the giving limits of script and direction. One other movie performance, though not so restricted by Hollywood norms, but never the less subsequently not appraised due to the portrayal of woman sexuality, is Meg Ryan in "In the cut" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0199626/ Keep on doing your wonderful magic, beautiful actresses.. don't let holy wood keep you back...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lyne's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Unfaithful" sets out a quite unoriginal story, but its worth lies in how it is told, and the result is Adrian Lyne's best work, in my opinion. The story introduces us to an all-American family, the Sumners, Ed (Richard Gere), Connie (Diane Lane) and their young son Charlie. They are attractive, have a reliable circle of friends and are respected in their community. The couple still enjoys their intimacy and there still is some passion, and much love and respect for each other. Nothing seems wrong with them, in their life as a couple. But all of a sudden, completely by chance, Connie meets the young Frenchman Paul (Olivier Martinez), a mysterious, bohemian heartthrob. The affair that the title refers to will soon begin..."Unfaithful" is easily recognizable as Lyne's work -the passionate affair between Connie and Paul, but also the marital love moments between Connie and Ed, are filmed with a great eye for sensuality, without ever being "soft porn" or anything gross or offensive, at least for the target public that the movie is aimed at. Diane Lane certainly deserved her Oscar nomination for her performance as the woman who has to juggle her two parallel lives, and deal with her love for her family, her remorse and her desire for a second youth -it's not by chance that Connie is nearing her forties, while Paul is yet not 30- and her newly found passion in her extramarital love affair. I have to say that her character, to me, was quite unlikable, and not only because of the fact that she cheats on her husband, but because she came across as an extremely self-centered and unconscious person, most of the time; but maybe the character was meant to seem that way to the audience. And I'm only talking about the character -Ms. Lane is nothing short of brilliant here, besides extremely beautiful and elegant. Richard Gere is also good in his role, with much more to say than just a stereotypical cheated husband.This movie is far superior to most of the dramas of its kind that have been filmed, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys good acting and a story full of passion and well-filmed eroticism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyed watching but not that great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that I could watch again, especially to see the chemistry between Diane Lane and Olivier Martinez. Diane Lane is at her best and I believe that this movie brought her career back to the spotlight. However, the second half of the movie, when I really come to think about it, is disappointing. I don't want to give away what happens, so only those who have seen the movie would know what I am referring to, but the motive for Richard Gere's actions are too contrived in wanting to blame the wife for his uncontrolled anger. The whole thing with Diane Lane's character giving her lover a gift that was shared with her husband is ludicrous! Who would do something like that? Certainly not anyone with good taste or half a brain. I thought that Adrian Lyne was a bit desperate there in looking for something awful on her part that would justify the husband's character so that in the end he is the victim. Just like Fatal Attraction takes away any blame from Michael Douglas's infidelity, this movie also zeroes in on the woman as the evildoer. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts promisingly but fails to deliver in the end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked how this movie started, the cinematography, the music, the atmosphere, the wind metaphor and all that were just about right and it continued in this fashion until we reached the turning point and it's all downhill from there. In the first part of the movie Diane Lane dominates the picture, and she really shows her talent in the train scene when she travels home after the first sexual encounter and relives all the events of the afternoon reflected in her face, just beautiful.*Spoiler ahead* However, when we reach the murder scene, the film starts to fall apart. First off, that scene is absolutely unrealistic. A poor delivery at a crucial scene like this can really put me off. After that as Gere starts to take center stage, the magic disappears as we are subject to his unconvincing acting. It's a shame because the film promised so much more. Although he tried I think Adrian Lyne just couldn't live up to his earlier work, particularly Nine ? Weeks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At times overpowering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the late 1970's and early 1980's when many women organized to develop ways to deal with unsolicited advances by men, this movie's premise would have provided a classic example of one of the potentially tense situations involving men in which women had found themselves. In fact, for the women who were coming up with ways to contend with sexual harassment, the scene in the bookstore when Paul Martel first comes on to Connie Sumner would have given valuable material for educational literature or an instructional video."Faithless" reinforces a belief, commonly held by men, that the aforementioned women hoped to dispel: If a woman first rejects your efforts to seduce her, persist and she will eventually give in. For those women working to empower themselves to better deal with male sexual impropriety, however, "Faithless" also presents an unpleasant truth that they may have felt reluctant to address - the behavior of some women supports the stereotype. Whether or not women, conditioned culturally to assume a subservient role in relationships or unaccustomed to trusting a wiser part of themselves, have too often accommodated men, "Faithless" can make a viewer question his/her ability to remain loyal to a partner.The behavior of Connie Sumner, as one of those women who ceases to resist, really disturbed me. Her husband, respectful and reasonably attractive, didn't seem to give her a reason to find him less appealing. A successful professional and outstanding provider, he also did not drive his wife away by neglecting her. In addition, Connie Sumner came across not as a promiscuous or psychologically underdeveloped woman (without the will to refuse), but as a well-adjusted woman who in an unexpected situation let her sexual feelings get to the point of overwhelming her.</fullReview>

A sound comment except the film is about a woman who feels just that way and the first half of the film concentrates upon her guilt and desire winning through. It is this part of the film which is so good. The extraordinary acting by the wife clearly shows the angst of a decision that is forced upon her. Very fine acting..a good screenplay and script yet something was not quite right.

		<fullReview>This movie is a modern marvel.It gives you today's open sex scenes, &amp; tenuous morals.Yet pulls you back to look at the dilemmas &amp; consequences of impulsive lascivious behavior.DIANE LANE was to "UNFAITHFUL" what KATHLEEN TURNER was to "BODY HEAT"..A gorgeous sex symbol but where TURNER was a femme fatale that purposely created victims,LANE unwittingly made herself,husband &amp; lover all victims of her libidinous lust.GERE'S character succumbed to the impulse of murder.Thus, the tragedy ends? for this couple in front of the police station.Very interesting conclusion to a well woven,entertaining &amp; perhaps controversial piece of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DIANE LANE's acting in this great film is unforgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DIANE LANE (of The Perfect Storm) is a revelation in this powerful and engrossing drama by Adrian Lyne (Fatal Attraction). Her acting in this film is unforgettable and I'm pleased that she is winning awards and getting nominated for her acting in this. She plays Connie, who after falling into an erotic affair, has her life (and family) falling apart around her. I watched this on DVD and loved it. The DVD was great with great picture, sound and extras. I will now be buying it without hesitation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basically a well-shot, well-scored Lifetime movie with nudity and no commercials. They could have easily cut this to fit into a 2-hr TV-movie time slot. The reviewer who said that this would be great for an MST3K revival was spot on - this was sooo slow-moving that the only way I got thru it was to crack jokes about it to my wife during the myriad pregnant pauses. One similarity that this had w/ the infinitely superior Fatal Attraction - both movies were centered around pretty couples who were stuck with an ug-lee kid! Is this Lyne's way of subtly foreshadowing trouble in paradise? For Diane Lane fetishists only, and you'd better be quick with the 'pause' button.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was watching this film, hoping for it to move at a faster pace, but it didn't. Not that it mattered, it was interesting to see how things came about. Overall, I give it 7 out of 10. It's a good film with great actors, it's just that the whole plot made me sick after watching it knowing everything that happened. It's amazing to see Diane Lane in a 'new' kind of role. Richard Gere is great, also. It's just that the whole concept of what the characters do and what messes they get themselves into is powerful.... I reccomend this highly, though! So go rent it/buy it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DIANE LANE proves she is one of THE BEST actresses working in Hollywood today with a sensational performance in "UNFAITHFUL". This is a star-making portrayal of a woman torn apart by her descent into betrayal and adultery. A thrilling piece of cinema that will have you engrossed yet entertained for it's duration. Classy and provocative "UNFAITHFUL" is one of the best films this year. Great acting, great story (not as "familiar" as you expect), and wonderful execution. A masterpiece! 10 out of 10. The DVD is remarkable with a great video transfer, excellent sound, and tons (and I mean TONS) of extra features.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting yet ultimately unfulfilling...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, despite a simple plot, this movie actually starts out pretty well. The events that take place pull you in and make you care for the main female character, even though she is really just an idiot. Richard Gere plays his part with a stone face, so who knows what's going on with him.***SPOILERS***Anyway, this film is gripping up until the point where it turns from a sexual basis to a violent one. The result is a disappointment as the filmmakers struggle to deliver a satisfying ending. On the one hand, we don't want a murderer to go free, but on the other hand, he is basically a good guy who got screwed over by his wife. In short, the crappy conclusion weakens an otherwise intriguing movie. Worth seeing if you don't mind unsatisfying endings.</fullReview>

Only problem is - it's impossible to sympathize with either lead (Lane or Gere), as they both seem to be self-centered jerks. The best way I can describe the lack of involvement is that my wife and I stopped the movie just before the key confrontation scene for fifteen minutes, to discuss how TV Guide On-line had the wrong description for the History Channel's Boys From Brazil. My wife says it could be considered light, Lifetime-like entertainment, and says she feel sorry for Lane. Whatever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that many might bash Lyne for this movie, but I for one, truly enjoyed it. I do of course, enjoy Lyne's previous work as well, but this effort does not deserve the criticism it receives. Lyne's staple desire is to provoke and to stir emotion, which he certainly accomplishes here. Granted, none of these actors are going to win an Oscar for this, but what they do deliver is a canvas of the destructive nature of infidelity. Lyne has made some brilliant films, and I agree with one thought of the previous reviewer, that Jacob's Ladder was extraordinary. However, this film, in my opinion is a thought provoking and certainly very entertaining film. All I can say, Lyne never fails to deliver entertainment and an enjoyable movie-going experience with films like this, Lolita and Jacob's Ladder. Keep up the great work Adrian!!!</fullReview>

It takes approximately one hour for this movies to get anywhere. With a better script the main plot of the film could have been established in 10 minutes and we could have enjoyed this 'thriller'. It also makes the NYPD look stupid. We're talking basic procedure here. They should have brought in Morgan Freeman and pitted him against a more wiley Richard Gere. Then we might have gotten somewhere. The only enjoyment I got from the film was spotting the holes in the suchasitwas plot.

Understandably hard to resist his charm. There were some slight flaws in the making of the film (you can see Richard Gere's black undies as he is getting in the tub with his wife) And when he goes outside with the boy on the windy day - it's not windy when they show him out there. Little stupid stuff like that; however, the movie does work. I thought the ending was really perfect. I love when you leave the theatre and are still thinking of the characters.

		<shortDescription>What happens when that light turns green?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very intense thriller about what happens when there are consequenses for our actions. UNFAITHFUL has been billed as the "other side" of FATAL ATTRACTION, perhaps because that film was also directed by Adrian Lyne. Another Michael Douglas film comes to mind, though, A PERFECT MURDER (with Gwyneth Paltrow as the cheating wife) when making comparisons.This time it is the wife who has a fling, even though she is obviously happily married to a husband who truly is devoted to her. She was not seeking an affair, she did not go out looking for a lover, but a coincidental moment provided the opportunity--an unguarded moment--and she acted on it.For once Hollywood paints a true picture. Indescretions come with a high price-tag. Are we willing to pay the price? Can one brief moment of excitement be worth the cost of living with the consequences for the rest of your life?The acting was top-notch, especially from Diane Lane (The Perfect Storm) and Richard Gere (Primal Fear). The final scene where they are at a stop light right in front of the police station contemplating whether to turn themselves in or run away to Mexico and start life all over is thought-provoking. What would you do? It seems every wrong decision creates a succession of other decisions.Give this one a look. It is worth your attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SIMPLY STUNNING FILM. HAUNTING, COOL AND SEXY. DIANE LANE SHINES IN THIS.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure if I wanted to see this, but the reviews I read were all really raving about it. So, I went, and I'm so pleased I did. This has to be one of the best films this years and one of the best thrillers ever. It's intense, it's haunting, it's subtle, yet it's also soooo cool, sexy and entertaining. Diane Lane shines in her starring role in this. She carries the movie so well, and I'm thrilled that she has at last become a star. It's a great performance that should win her an Academy Award. The acting by Richard Gere and Olivier Martinez (wow! is he a hottie) are also near perfect. The plot is well served by Adrian Lyne's hypnotic direction. First class movie-making. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Diane Lane breakthrough!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I am (and have been for a while), a BIG Diane Lane fan. I've always admired her natural beauty Unfaithful is the first movie that allowed her to truly display her acting competence. She's been primarily playing second fiddle to Snipes, Sobieske - hmmmm -, Reeves. Fortunately, Lyne entrusted Lane with the lead role and she did not dissapoint. This movie does lack an "Oscar-bound" script. Heck, 99% of the movies do. That however, does not translate into a bad storyline. The flow of the movie is wonderful and very provocative. Gere and Lane are great as husband and wife, Martinez on the other hand, will thrill women viewers (maybe even men...) with his sexy french accent and rugged looks. Make no mistake though! This is the Diane Lane show. She will take you along for a rollercoaster ride you won't soon forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Diane Lane is wonderful. I believe that she is being tormented by her decisions. But I have no idea why she decided to do what she decided to do. It wasn't clear at the beginning of the movie, and it was never made clear. Aside from the obvious message that infidelity is wrong, I don't see what the point of making this movie is. If it were for some wonderful acting, and some passionate scenes, the film would've been a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie coming in unbiased and with no knowledge of it. I avoid TV and newspapers, and some friends took me to it out of the blue. Therefore I had not seen the trailers/teasers/spoilers you get along with the bias of critics and media's opinions.The loose plot and slow acting many times made me wonder if the director actually knew what he was doing. This film was heavy with visions of sexual intent, but light on the actual content. The problem is that half the movie seemed to be about sex and the rest filler to try and justify it.The plot was straight out of a trashy romance novel where lonely bored housewife meets guy and cheats on husband to spice up her life. Regret sets in, but the cute younger man keeps her coming back. They elude to her getting it just about everywhere and every way imaginable. Basically, the forbidden fruit syndrome makes her cheat more even when she wants out.The acting was what you would expect to see on a bad soap opera. The only person who seemed to be able to act (or given a chance) at all was Connie (Diane Lane). The problem is many times they had her playing conflicting emotions simultaneously. Edward Sumner (Richard Gere) and Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez) played very 2 dimensional characters. They had very little life in them, and the plot was so focused on her that no other character was able to achieve any depth. The son seemed merely like an afterthought, and not an actual character. He seemed little more than an extension of Edward.As far as the overall movie, the camera work was good for a low budget film, but not for a movie that had a single known actor. The story line was so blatant that you knew what was going to always happen next. There was no suspense to the movie at all. The dialogue was poor and sparse as most of it was grunts and groans. The pace of the movie ranged from quickly jumping from sex scene to sex scene then running long pauses where you wondered if you would be able to keep your eyes open.Overall, I would not recommend this movie to see. That is unless you like trashy romance novels, afternoon soaps, and don't care about either plot or character depth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not predictable in a predictable way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>UNFAITHFUL, although not a truly satisfying film by any stretch, at least does not play itself out in a garishly predictable fashion, and for this alone it is worth sitting through. Diane Lane (who looks strikingly like Tuesday Weld in some of her shots) provides a believable center for the proceedings, although the pivotal literally-swept-into-another-man's-arms scene felt more than a shade contrived. (Plus I grew up in NYC, and I've never experienced that sort of gale force wind in all the years I lived there.) But Gere and Lane are good together, with many moments of unspoken subtlety passing between them. Lyne is remarkably restrained here - none of the hystrionics of, say, Lolita's climactic scene (which actually holds up, thanks to Jeremy Irons' and Frank Langella's superb talents), and it works to his advantage very well. The film IS predictable, though, in that it does break down into three obvious acts - girl meets another boy, girl sneaks around to be with this other boy, hubby finds out and goes ballistic with tragic consequences. But it does play out in an intelligent and thoughtful manner, which counts for something in my book.</fullReview>

I usually find him unbearably vain but he finally seems like a real grown-up. This was such an interesting movie and the premise was so juicy that even if the entire movie doesn't necessarily work, I still really enjoyed it. Alot of people feel the movie was preachy but I felt it was quite thoughtful and even handed though flawed. It was so much better than I expected and quite disturbing on a number of fronts that I definitely recommend seeing it and talking about it with your friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfaithful is almost unwatchable. Saved by Diane Lane.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that the star power of its 30 to 40-something actresses is all Hollywood has going for itself now. Unfaithful is a terrible movie with leaden performances by the two male leads, turgid writing and a see through plot. Richard Gere was either woefully miscast or simply uninterested in this movie. Oliver Martinez, excellent as a romantic hero, is an affectless bore.The climax of the movie happens over THIRTY MINUTES before the closing credits roll--and that last half hour takes forever, since you just don't care what happens to these characters. However, there is Diane Lane. She redeems this movie. She is gorgeous, talented and completely alive to the camera. Great body, legs that most strippers would envy, eyes you can simply fall into. Her portrayal is riveting, comparable (but completely different from) Tilda Swinton in last year's "The Deep End"--another suburban housewife who acts impulsively.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this movie I could not believe that society had sunk this low. A lady has an affair on her husband and no one is made out to be a bad guy. I sat through the whole movie angry because the camera looked at Lane as someone who was just exploring herself and not really doing anything wrong. Where has our morals gone. I know it's just a movie, but it was like a killer or something like that that I could say this doesn't really happen. This actually does happen and that's what I couldn't get out of my mind. At least we could have seen her from a negative point of view. Also, I believe that they showed to much when it came to the sex. I love details, but this is where they could have been left out. It got too detailed when we knew exactly where his hands were going and everything. There are other movies where people have affairs, but in them either the sex is only talked about or it is more sensual (just rolling around in the covers). My biggest problem was that Lane needed to be made out to be the bad guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intelligent flipside to Fatal Attraction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer for this film I was not very interested in the film. It is directed by Adrain Lyne, the man behine Fatal Attraction, which dealt with the same subject, cheating on one's mate. Where as the earlier film just became a thriller, forever embedding Glen Close in the movie psycho hall of fame! This film flips the situation around, Diane Lane is a woman who cheats on her husband played by Richard Gere. She meets a french book dealer and begins a torrid sexual fling with him. The interesting thing about the movie is that Diane Lane's character is is presented to be in a good marriage, Gere is a good husband and father , nothing seems to be wrong in the marriage. Its seems to be someting she justs wants to do. The movie doesn't go the route that Fatal Attraction went, the movie doesn't go for the usual thriller plot devices, the tension in the film comes from the actors, Gere is really good, Diane Lane has a role that shows her acting ability. I don't give spoilers, but the movie is not really a thriller, but a tragedy,it shows that the choices people make have consequences. As far as the ambigious ending, as moviegoers these type of endings aren't really popular, but this one seems appropriate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why? It made here feel alive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A poster below asked why this woman would risk all that she has for some hot sex. Her is my take on it. Diane Lane had everything you could ask for in a family but it does not mean that there is nothing else in the world that she desires. By happenstance she found a man that ignited a little passion. He made her feel desired and and sexy and everything that a suburban housewife is not. This is all just my guess - I am an unmarried man in a long term relationship. I can only guess. I would imagine that to suddenly live a life outside of your own would be an enticing possibility.From statistics I have seen, the rates of infidelity are nearly the same for men and women (around 28%). I'm sure that all of these people aren't in bad relationships - some of them are just captured in the moment. I thought the film captured this idea perfectly. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lyne presents us the ramifications of adultery in chilling style...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> Adrian Lyne solidifies his stance as the master of the adulterous thriller. This talented director has brought us unforgettable films that deal with the complexities and consequences of infidelity. Ranging from ?Indecent Proposal' to ?Fatal Attraction', Lyne now adds another notch under his belt with the elegant and sublime ?Unfaithful'. Richard Gere stars and interestingly enough takes a ?back seat' in this film. Much like Harrison Ford's role in ?What Lies Beneath', we do not see much of Gere's character as the plot plays out inviting his participation in the third act. Gere stars as Edward Sumner, a loving father and husband who suspects his wife is having an affair. The sultry Diane Lane (Hardball, The Perfect Storm') entices us with her dualistic characteristics as a seemingly loving wife who is as yet unfulfilled with her sexual fantasies. After a haphazard encounter with a young Frenchman, she indulges herself in her wildest sexual fantasies with this young man tarnishing her relationship with her husband and breaking up the loving household presented to us in the opening frames of the film. Lyne introduces us to the loving family in question through a simplistic morning sequence where breakfast is served, kisses are exchanged, the child is tucked off to school and glances of ever-lasting love are noticed between Edward (Gere) and his wife Connie (Lane). As everyone goes their own way for the day, Connie ventures out of her New York suburban home and into the city only to awaken her dormant sexual appetite. Olivier Martinez is impressively brute as a Parisian in SoHo (NYC) who enchants and woos our lady while Lyne unravels this somber plot in stunning fashion. Lyne brings forward a perspective that many married couples deal with in their lives. The question of `What if' is at the center of this film as the act of infidelity and its' ramifications are presented to us in dire fashion. Lyne should be praised for his sense of cohesiveness and beauty as he displays his maturity on screen. While ?Fatal Attraction' and ?9 ? Weeks' will forever be known for their gratuitous sex scenes, Lyne focuses on character development and content in order to bring us a lush and vast piece of entertainment. Not taking anything from the two said films, but it was fairly evident that Lyne was focusing on the sex in those films. In his newest film, Lyne always incorporates the oldest act of love in the manner that Lyne can only vividly present. As compared to his other films, these scenes seem raw and animalistic all the while resonating a strong hint of elegance. This last statement may evoke a contradicting opinion, but I always found his other films and their sex scenes as staged and lensed one frame at a time. Moreover, the scenes are toned down in this film and do not drag as in his other films. These scenes are taut and display the required emotion to enhance character development. The underlining trait in this film is the realistic and disastrous effect a loving husband can inhibit after discovering his loving wife is committing adultery. Performances bring this movie to life as this remake of Claude Chabrol's 1969 French Film ?La Femme Infidele' is chilling insight into the lengths a husband will go to in order to save his marriage. Gere's rich performance as a mundane and boring husband is argued as he meets his wife's lover; from seeing the bed in which the act was committed to meeting the man that has caused such grief and torment. This displays the crushing feeling this loving husband has experienced. All the while making this remake a great film which is rare in the standard times of Hollywood we are living in.Giancarlo's Rating: ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 9.9. A single stupid flaw kept it from a 10.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether a film is good or not has more to do with whether I check my watch once, twice or ten times during the showtime. I could care less about who's in it, who directed it or what it's about; and on that basis, this is a 9.95 out of 10. And it's too bad Chad Lowe's character had to walk straight out the door when he gets canned. That stupid flaw kept it from a perfect 10. Imagine a man, 100% committed to his wife and family. Imagine a woman 92% committed to hers, the same people. It's a fairy tale so real you're glued instantly to the story, circumstance and every one of its characters, including Erick Per Sullivan who, if Lane and Gere ever had a kid, this is certainly what he would look like.Diane Lane (loved her since Lonesome Dove) and Richard Gere (is there a better ending than "Officer and a Gentleman"?) are stunning. Olivier Martinez might as well steel himself for a flood of offers in the months ahead (for filmwork . . . , or who knows?!). This is perfect film making, a brilliant use of subtlety (as opposed to wacking the audience over its collective head with a sledge hammer), with scenes Alfred Hitchcock himself could not have better et up. As to my second sentence up there &lt;&lt; I could care less about who's in it, who directed it or what it's about &gt;&gt; . . . complete baloney. But I needed a hook. Leave your watch at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfulfilled might be a better title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that only gets you about half way there.Adrian Lyne has put together a stylish American version of a French film, but unfortunately left out the gritty realism that makes French films about love affairs so much better than American ones.This movie does have a lot going for it. Fine acting, good direction, first class production values. But in the end, it falls victim to what sinks most American films these days, an under written script.The film tells the tale of Connie Sumner, a well off East Coast housewife who is another one of those movie versions of the woman who "has it all" -- loving husband, nice kid and a very comfortable existence. (American movies, caught up in materialism, play on the fear factor, showing audiences how much they have to lose. "Don't let them take it away" is the number one theme.) But one fine day while on a shopping trip to Manhattan, she gets caught up in a movie wind storm second only to the one that sucked up Dorothy and she lands in the arms of Paul Martel,a French-born book dealer. They start a torrid love affair.That's the story, or at least about 75 percent of it. With no subplot, the movie focuses on the affair and little else and while the couplings are fun to watch, it is a remarkably bland affair with few bumps along the way on the road to orgasmville.That's the problem. We get way too little from this movie in terms of who, what, when, where and why. Diane Lane does a first class job as Connie, Richard Gere is also excellent as her husband, Edward. Oliver Martinez would seem to be just right as the sexy foreigner.But the movie never answers the question, what is this affair all about? Lane is depicted as a woman with a very nice life. She has money and security. Her husband is handsome, successful, attentive to her and a great dad. Connie herself does not seem unhappy. We never learn why she is willing to risk everything. Diane Lane's character remains an enigma throughout the film.In the late seventies, a French film, called "After Sex" in America, dealt with the same topic. But there, actress/director Brigette Rouan at least gave us a hint as to why she strayed from a good marriage. It was because she saw the handwriting on the wall, or rather in the mirror. She was getting older and soon, the chances for finding an exciting romance would be few and far between. She needed that kind of excitement in her life, if only one last time.That may be Lane's motivation, too, but if so, it doesn't really wash. The film goes to no small lengths to prove to us that Lane herself is drop dead gorgeous. That wind in the beginning practically tears her skirt off her, giving us the best shot of a pair of great gams since Rita Hayworth. She must have had many other opportunities, and she might have them for another ten years to come. She is that handsome of a woman. And Martinez doesn't exactly go out of his way to court her. She comes to him, over and over again, so it is not the thrill of just getting some attention.American movies often skip over the motivation part to get to the action part, and that is what director Lyne seems to have done, perhaps afraid that showing motivation would make his film too intellectual.But I kept wanting Lane to spill the beans to somebody about why she was doing all this. Publicity accompanying this film has indicated Lane is supposed to be having the best sex of her life. Maybe true, but press releases don't count. You're supposed to put the story up there on the screen. Maybe we were just supposed to get it --that she liked having orgasms. Ok, but there's no reason to believe she wasn't having them with her husband. In the end, I get the feeling logic and motivation took a back seat to gee whiz movie making here. Getting a chance to watch Diane Lane get her panties ripped off her, then turn around and bend over to receive her lover was supposed to make us forget that not many women with as much to lose as she had would have done that in the hallway of an apartment building. Not many would have had hot sex in a bathroom stall in a restaurant, while her two girlfriends were waiting for her at the table.Was it the thrill? The danger? If so, why did she want danger?In the end, this was movie making that went for the cheap thrill over solid plotting, which makes the highly ambiguous, art house ending all that much harder to understand. This was movie making that could have said a lot more, but chose to follow the Hollywood formula instead. I can give this only a tepid endorsement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Enough Character Development.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director could have easily developed all the characters a lot more than what he has done in this film. Lane's character is portrayed as a sexually unfulfilled wife but then the story suggests she is very much indeed satisfied with her own husband as well, at least in the first few sex scenes of the movie. She wonders into a stranger's apartment but yet we are forced to believe that she scores at least average as to her intelligence (I have argued with friends over this one and I still choose to believe that any other regular person, especially if she happens to be a suburban middle aged wife, would not step into a young New Yorker's place without a significant reason, which the film indicates she lacked)so that whole element seemed as bizarre to me as the extremely windy weather which almost looked unbelievable to say the least. I did not like what Gere had done with his character either. I think where Gere lacks as an actor is that over all portrayal of "caring" about any damn thing. He just simply always looks so cool and calm, it was hard for me to imagine that is how a husband behaves when he finds out where his wife's lover lives. I would love Michael Douglas in that role.But I did enjoy the movie after all. It was refreshing to see a film that is indeed a little different from all the rest of the mainstream garbage the major studios are putting out these days. I took a chance with this one and I think it was worth it. I read somewhere that the director cut out the original ending of this movie. Anyone knows what it was supposed to be?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly intriguing film that continues Lyne's reign of the `sexy thriller' genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The newest film from Adrian Lyne (`Fatal Attraction', `9 ? Weeks') continues the director's masterful streak in the `sexy thriller' genre. While the mention of Richard Gere might turn most people (and gerbils) off, he is actually surprisingly good and shares less screen time than `supporting actor' Oliver Martinez. It's Diane Lane that really carries the film, though. While she hasn't had the chance to shine in recent years, she proves that an `almost 40' actress can still be sexy in a leading role. All of the characters, while flawed, are likeable in their own way. The viewer has to choose who is the real `bad guy' in the end. Is it the cheating wife who really wants to break off the fling or the suspecting husband who acts on his jealousy? And what of the object of desire? Is the man in question wrong for continuing to stand in the way of an otherwise happily married couple? The end of the film is the only part that is really disappointing. It's not entirely believable and not exactly what most viewers would choose as the perfect ending. Otherwise this film is pretty intriguing. It brings you in and doesn't let go very often. While there are several places where this film could have easily unraveled, it holds together pretty well. This movie isn't for everyone. It might be a little steamy for the kiddos and might move a little slowly for others, but if you're a fan of the genre, you won't be disappointed. I was especially surprised after my initial impression from the trailer and the `This movie sucks, man!' vote of confidence from the usher at the theater. Go check it out if it looks like something you'll enjoy. Otherwise it will probably hold up just as well on video if you'd rather catch `Spider Man' again on the big screen instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and strong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing an Adrian Lyne movie, I usually feel like scrubbing myself, an image that actually occurs in this film. It's not that his films are trashy, quite the opposite - they make you look at things you would rather not acknowledge. For 'Unfaithful', filled with disturbing images and powerful performances, there just isn't enough soap.Diane Lane, who played an almost identical role in 'Walk On The Moon', is the perfect choice for Connie Sumner, a suburban housewife and mother whose life is a little too perfect. Con bumps into Paul (Olivier Martinez, who seems to have stepped out of a Calvin Klein ad) on a windy day - a bit of heavy-handed symbolism that is one of the movie's few letdowns - and scrapes her knee as she falls on top of him, their separate personal cargoes sent flying. A few meetings later this young thing is helping Connie to brush up on her French.Sounds erotic, but don't go expecting eroticism. From their very first connection, Connie begins to get unstrung by her growing desire for Paul, and soon it becomes an obsession that interferes with daily life, not to mention the volunteer activities she uses as an excuse for frequent trips to the City. Husband Ed (Richard Gere) and son Charlie soon notice things have changed because Connie has a wistful, far-off look and behaves erratically (interesting homonym there). Even the dog seems to sniff that something is up.It's been compared to 'In The Bedroom' because of the unalterable violence toward which the plot leads, but that isn't quite right. Jealousy and lust, the engines that move this film, are less predictable than revenge. And more shocking and damaging.Lyne reins in his over-the-top tastes and gets it right this time, with patient attention to details as subtle as turning off a light at the wrong time. Lane is mostly magnificent as a woman struggling to regain control of herself - at times you absolutely despise Connie, seeing the little smile she uses to string Ed along. And Gere is remarkably un-Gere, no swagger, just dedication and talent finally coming to bloom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I certainly agree with everyone that the story is rivoting, and the performances convincing thrrough and through. The characters were multi dimensional and the film's subtle ambivalence forces us to sort things out for ourselves. And Diane Lane is as talented as she is charming and beautiful. It is furthermore always good to see someone, anyone, making modern day morality plays (in the tradition of A Simple Plan) which powerfully depict the destructive nature of whim worship and carpe diem in our time. What I found wholly inexplicable were the repeated and severe oversights in editing, which made a suspension of disbelief all but impossible. Nearly every interior shot filmed in the home had boom microphones hanging, dangling, in front of us-- mind you, not simply a barely visible smudge in the upper corner, but halfway down the screen! And this occurs over and over and over again throughout the film. It perplexes me that such an expensive production could contain so many amateurish errors. There are a host of people at varying stages of the process who are guilty of gross neglect and they should certainly never work again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story of a chance encounter between a beautiful older woman (Lane) and a sexy stranger (Martinez) that leads to a smoldering love affair is but the superficial layer in this tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of a chance encounter between a beautiful older woman (Lane) and a sexy stranger (Martinez) that leads to a smoldering love affair is but the superficial layer in this tale. To truly appreciate this movie I had to accept this film for what it was and not for what else I wanted it to be, and for that reason I am very satisfied having seen it.First off, full attention should be given to Diane Lane, for not only carrying this film, but rather because she does in fact give an outstanding powerful performance. Her performance speaks volumes about her character. There are no scenes where we see her character confide in anyone, be it in the movie or with the audience, and yet you can see the unsatisfied woman she is becoming subtly expressed on her face and in her manners. She is of course actually a beautiful woman, which serves her character and this story all the better.At first the film goes through the motions, playing out the standard elements of a tale of infidelity. In this case we have a view to the Sumner family's present day situation in their now 11 year old marriage. The couple Connie (Lane) and Edward (Gere), are happily married as they raise their child away from the city in the suburbs. One windy day in New York, while attempting to flag a taxi cab, Connie is blown to the ground and lands atop a handsome French stranger. As faith would have it the incident takes place right in front of his apartment and so she accepts his offer to come up to his place to fix her scraped knee. His name is Pierre (Martinez), a book collector who is house-sitting for one the owner of this huge apartment. He fixes Connie a cup a coffee and before she leaves directs her to a specific location on one of the many bookshelves to retrieve a book he will give to her. This moment ultimately puts the wheels of this story in motion.The film is given an edge by its perfect cast. Olivier Martinez is slick and suave yet maintains an air of intelligence, which is perhaps what makes him so believably irresistible. Richard Gere, manages to come through as a man that is slowly beginning to suspect his wife's affair. Certainly had it not been for these actors the movie would not have worked so well. An unexpected twist that comes half way in the film would usually have caused my eyes to roll, but surely enough I was shocked. These characters had nicely developed scenes, enough so to understand what they are going through. Now don't get me wrong, I did have some problems with this film as it does at times feature silly coincidences, and perhaps even a few too many clichés, such as the coffee shop scene where Connie is coincidentally given incite on why love affairs end in disaster. There were a few more moments such as this, but again it was not the biggest deal, simply a pet peeve.Adrian Lyne certainly loves directing stories that leave the audience talking long after the credits, and I for one am thankful for that. She has in the past delivered to that result with `Fatal Attraction' and `Indecent Proposal'. I can't say that this film is as good as those, but certainly will fuel discussions of its own. I too took part in dissecting certain parts of this relationship with my girlfriend upon exiting the theatre, and for moments afterward. Be sure that that was not the last discussion I will have in regards to having seen this movie.From its symbolic `winds of change come blowing in' beginning, through it's beautifully shot and steamy love affair, right back to the paranoid relationship of its central characters, `Unfaithful' keeps you watching. You definitely need to sit back during this one, being that it is one of those movies that almost demands you shift in your seat while you ponder how or why these characters are behaving the way they are. Still, it had enough charm and intrigue to keep me entertained and involved the whole way through, and thinking and talking about it long after it was over. Looking forward to Diane Lane's next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes marriage just isn't enough!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edward and Connie Sumner (Gere &amp; Lane) are the perfect middle-aged couple living the American dream. They live a wonderful life in the New York City suburbs with their precocious nine year old son. On a random day, a very windy day, Connie takes a trip to the city to run some errands and buy her son a birthday present. However, her day is marred by a nasty fall where she cuts her knee on the dirty street. A kind and mysterious stranger offers to help... "Why don't you come up and clean it off, no?" He is a French book trader with a sultry accent, tons of charm, and looks that draw her into a dangerous game of flirting. Their first meeting is a relatively innocent one but it isn't their last. She can't stop thinking about him, and no matter how much she loves her family she just has to go back and see him... over and over and over again. Their subsequent meetings are not that innocent to say the least. Soon enough Edward begins to sense that things are wrong and hires a private detective to deliver him the truth. I won't reveal the details, but as a surrounding character says early in the film... "Affairs always end tragically." Edward and Connie struggle with the situation, one consumed by guilt, the other by jealousy. With what they know and what they've done, they need to find a way to come back together after a vacation from their normal lives.This is a great film. This is a mature, intelligent, erotic, exciting, sad and honest story of a marriage in trouble. Virtually every struck note rings true, and that is a credit to all involved in the making of this film. The director, Adrian Lyne (Fatal Attraction), has experience in this kind of movie, but this is his best work yet. There is an unsentimental, sad &amp; thoughtful tone from the very first scene. The opening shots of the 'American Dream' house, an empty boat and a quiet suburban neighborhood on a cold misty morning are the perfect mood-setters. I have heard it said that a great film can be enjoyed with the sound off or without the picture... unfortunately it seems that many films today would best be enjoyed without either! Unfaithful is one of the films that has fantastic visuals and superlative dialogue and music. Lyne hasn't missed a step and should be remembered when next year's award season rolls around.The acting is absolutely amazing. Richard Gere hasn't been this powerful in a long time... maybe ever! He is an innocent husband drawn into a horrible scenario and the range that Gere shows surprised the heck out of me. I had always considered him a very good actor... but this role is much better than very good. Diane Lane is as courageous as any actress has been in a long time. Her work here reminded me of Catherine Deneuve in Belle de Jour. Lane has to be vulnerable, sexy, slutty, sad, guilty, angry, scared, and regretful, all the while being sympathetic to the viewer... she handles all of those emotions with incredible accuracy. Consider the scene on the train when she recalls her first liaison with her lover. We cut back and forth with the actual encounter and it is one of the most erotic and powerful scenes in years. Lane's acting is the key here... she treads the line between laughter and 'guilty tears' so well. That scene reminded me of one of the most memorable love scenes in film history which took place in 1973's "Don't Look Now" with Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie. Diane Lane should be nominated for every award there is... I hope the Academy can remember back this far when the Oscars roll around next year. Olivier Martinez is a relative newcomer as the French lover. He handles every scene well, especially the one when he meets the husband for the first time. He goes toe to toe with Gere in a very awkward and emotionally jarring scene. I am sure we will see more of Martinez in the future.The score is beautiful. Primarily strings and piano dominate this under-appreciated cinematic art. In Unfaithful the score is haunting and winsome and sad and uneasy... all at once. It may not be melodic in the way you can whistle it on the way home... but it will help you remember all the feelings you had throughout the film. I am sure I will add it to my soundtrack collection for those quiet nights when I'm moody and pensive.This is assuredly one of the finest films of the year. It is mature in its examination of a seemingly happy marriage... I cannot recommend this film more. Adults, especially couples, who want to see something other than the mindless kiddy flicks in theatres right now, would do well to see Unfaithful... you will talk about it for days, maybe weeks after. 4 Stars - 97 / 100 - A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I bet some people will be griping about the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised to see this rated so low after only a couple days of release. I felt that 'Unfaithful' presented a very realistic portrait of marriage and infidelity, and of one moment that pushes everything past the breaking point.**SPOILERS**Constance (Diane Lane) isn't necessarily unhappy as much as she is bored with her life, and when she meets a young, handsome French man, she starts sleeping with him, even though she knows it's wrong. Edward (Richard Gere) senses immediately that something is going on with his wife, but it takes a vindictive remark from an ex-employee for him to do something about it. Unfortunately, he decides to confront the young man with tragic results.Rather than blame suburbia or portray Edward as a rotten husband, the film assumes the best about all of the characters, including the lover, so it pulls you in. Lane reminds everyone that she doesn't get enough film work; not only is she gorgeous, but she is absolutely believable as a middle-aged, upper-middle-class wife and mother. Gere is also outstanding as Edward, who tries to do right and be a good husband and father, and through one very bad miscalculation (maybe two), finds himself in an inescapable moral dilemma. Olivier Martinez is good as the hunky boyfriend, but really the focus remains on Constance and Edward, with scenes so taut you could almost hear them snap.However, the ending will not please American audiences. It is very ambiguous, and if there's one thing we want, it's to have all messiness tied up in a neat little bow, and as happily as possible, too. This movie won't give you that. It won't make it that easy on anyone. In fact, this is nicely foreshadowed by making everyone involved a real person instead of a caricature, or not turning one of the three into a psycho (a lá Fatal Attraction). There are good performances in the supporting cast, although Chad Lowe needs a shave. If you are squeamish about sex scenes, this may not be the movie for you. If you favor partisan points of view where one person or the other is the bad guy, you won't find it here. You WILL find an excellent movie about real people getting pushed into places they never expected.</fullReview>

Adrian Lyne knows how to pull the strings, as Diane Lane and the viewer gets pulled into the seductive hands of this cheesy French guy. Lots of unintentional laughs as we watch her get into trouble and Richard Gere get suspicious. I typically hate Gere but he's actually okay in this role. What's cool about the film, besides the Playboy Channel type love scenes, is the fact it doesn't always play to expectations and I always appreciate that. Worth a look and don't worry, while the director might be taking this very seriously, please don't as a viewer. You'll enjoy it a lot more...</fullReview>

The beginning was a little slow and the Olivier Martinez character could have been cast better.

I think that Diane Lane's emotions were a little too overblown at some times, and not dramatic enough at others.

		<fullReview>I have to say that this may be the best work of Richard Gere's career, and what can I say about Diane Lane, stunning as always. If it is possible, this role is deeper and even more personal and poignant than the one that she had in A Walk on the Moon, although I tended to be more sympathetic to the character of Pearl in A Walk on the Moon. As for the movie itself, I have some problems with it, but as any discussion of those problems would be a spoiler, it will have to be saved for another time. I would suggest that anyone and everyone interested in Unfaithful see it, and then go home and rent A Walk on the Moon. I think it is a far superior story, and deals with the nuances of infidelity and marital harmony in a much more interesting and satisfactory way. Still with that said, I hope that Ms. Lane and Mr. Gere's performances are remembered come awards season, as these are incredible performances that push the limits of the actor's craft.</fullReview>

What sets UNFAITHFUL apart from all those horrible late-night softcore cable movies are: 1) meticulous production design and direction 2) great acting from both Lane and Gere, and 3) an intelligent, organic story. The script, however, is somewhat predictable up to the 2/3rds mark, but after that I couldn't see where the story was heading. I personally like ambiguous endings, so this flick was a nice change of pace. I was afraid of Lynne bashing me over the head with a message, but no: he lets you think about all the implications of what transpires on the screen. NYC looks really good in this movie too (having lived in NYC for six years, the film really captures the whole suburban commuter scene really well).Good movie for a rainy afternoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was interested in seeing this film because I was a fan of "Fatal Attraction" when it came out. However, I was really expecting just a tired retread of the same thing. What I saw instead was an exceptional film that was totally engrossing from start to finish...and oh what a great ending!The films actors and the taught direction make the characters so realistic that the movie is sometimes uncomfortably real and intense. Out of all the great performances it was the incredible performance by Diane Lane which impressed me the most. Infact, it impressed me more than nearly any other female performance I've seen for years. It is one of those performances that can only be described as "perfect". Lane played an adulteress before in "A Walk On The Moon", but she is even better in "Unfaithful" and that combined with her sexy (very sexy) role should catapult her to mega-stardom.Richard Gere is also fantastic. He plays very against type and does a great job. I thought that Gere had lost it after a couple of duds, but this puts him right back up there.Olivier Martinez is a great new find. The guy has presence, he can act for sure, and he is one good looking man. The girls in our group were swooning the whole time!Anyway, if you love superbly crafted and entertaining films that ask questions of the audience, then you won't find better than this. If you want great acting and realistic characters you care about, then you won't find better than this. An engrossing, entertaining and exceptional movie, with a wonderful ending! Superb!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't believed I loved this as much as I did</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing with these preview screenings is that they are free. This enables you to see movies that you probably wouldn't have otherwise paid to see. However, I can honestly say that having seen "Unfaithful" I would pay to see it again and again. This is one cool movie. In fact I'm still shocked at just how much I loved this film. It's one of those haunting films that stays with you, and a whole day later, I can't stop thinking and talking about it.Everything (except maybe some of the dialogue) is great in this film. The dialogue can be treacly at times and unoriginal, but "Unfaithful" makes up for it with brilliant direction, superb tense action and some of the best performances I've seen so far this year.Diane Lane of "The Perfect Storm" and "Murder At 1600" fame, plays a somewhat bored housewife, who dearly loves her handsome husband and son (played by Richard Gere and Erik Per Sullivan respectively). But one day she collides with an even more handsome stranger ("Before Night Falls" Olivier Martinez) and what ensues is a tense, slow-burning, sensuous, and very satisfying thriller with an amazing (and very tragic) final act. The films stylish build-up is mesmerizing, and everybody is believable and likeable (even Diane Lane's adulteress).The amazing thing about this film is, that it sounds like the sort of film you've seen 100 times before. But, I and others I spoke to after, felt that the film was so different from the norm in the way that it gets to where it's going. I was refreshed to see a film take the surprise turns that this one did. It's an original un-original movie, if that makes sense?Another big plus for this film was the impeccable performances. I've never seen Richard Gere reinvent himself like he does here, and as for the beautiful Diane Lane - well she simply soars. She holds the viewer in a vice like grip with her expressions, her timing, her beauty, and her human quality. It's a perfect performance and I hope that this performance wins her major kudos, because it is one of those great performances that comes along once in a while.While it is difficult to discuss the films final third without spoiling it, I will say that it is a real thrill ride. I loved this film far more than I thought I would, and I'll be going to see it again with friends soon. A great film and a 9 out of 10 for me. (A point off for some of the dialogue).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AN AWESOME MOVIE! GERE AT HIS BEST IN A VERY DIFFERENT ROLE FOR HIM, &amp; DIANE LANE IS SIMPLY AWESOME IN THIS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this at an advance screening last night, and I have to say that I thought it was gonna be a predictable and dull romantic thriller. But, but, - I was so, so wrong. This film really was an awesome movie! Entertaining, enthralling and beautifully shot and acted.I have to be honest that I am not a Richard Gere fan, but this was such a different role for him to do. He was so vulnerable, believable and yet sturdy as the husband. I think this is his finest ever performance (better even than "Internal Affairs", "Primal Fear" and "Pretty Woman").However, the real star of this film is Diane Lane, who delivers one of the best female star performances I've seen in ages. She practically "owns" the film, and steals every scene she's in (which is most of them as she is the main character). Lane is an actress who's been around since she was about 6 years old, and has acted in over 40 films winning a lot of industry respect and fans along the way, but this is at last her big chance to show what she can really, really do with a great part in a good, solid movie. Believe me she delivers and takes the opportunity with both hands. Great acting all around with only French star Olivier Martinez proving to be a little out of his depth. He is not bad at all, although his accent is a little troublesome, but he is up there with actors on top of their game and he seems a little out of his depth. He is certainly one to watch though, and is very good-looking. In fact Gere, Martinez and Lane make a very attractive star cast.Adrian (Fatal Attraction) Lyne's direction is stylish and assured and the movie as a whole is an awesome thriller with plot twists, edge of the seat tension, and great performances. Definately worth seeing. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh this movie gives you more than expected! I only expected a Romantic Thriller with mainstream ingredients but I didn't expect it to be that steamy and hot.The plot is from your typical Erotic Thriller from Skinemax but with an interesting twist and great character development.Diane Lane delivers a fantastic performance held by sexiness, maturity, and ...hotness! Richard Gere is perfect in his jealous husband role.Oliver Martínez stole the show . That's what women say.I recommend "Unfaithful" for those like me who enjoy Erotic Thrillers with and edge and of course, the highlight of the movie: steamy, hot sex sequences.I love the bathroom and hall sex scenes. You can't get better than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We can watch films to view the "message" of their stories, and muse at length about the characters, their motivations, the consequences which result, etc., etc. --- but we also watch to be entertained, whether the film is escapist, outrageous science-fiction, humorous (whether over-the-top or subtle), a mystery/whodunit, or (like this film) romantic, with both dark and engaging moments.As one of the latter, Diane Lane's performance is perfectly sensual and seductive, and she also portrays the "dutiful" wife and mother when called-for.Richard Gere is excellent, as the assertively-successful businessman, yet thoroughly phlegmatic in his response to his wife's infidelity. This is a complete counterpoint to the type of macho character he has usually portrayed.Olivier Martines is perfect as the precise type of handsome, romantic, somewhat bohemian type, with whom an upper-class, suburban housewife like Lane would become enthralled.As some others have maintained, I feel the Gere character would have been less reclusive in hiding his suspicions and doubts than was shown in the film --- despite the logical, compelling arguments as to how the types of marital infidelities are handled differently by the betrayed husband versus the betrayed wife.But, again, it is an excellent piece of entertainment, a prime (if not sole) reason we view a film or play.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adrian Lyne looks at infidelity from another perspective....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adrian Lyne, the director who scared a lot of men out of cheating on their wives with his 1987 classic FATAL ATTRACTION, takes another look at infidelity in UNFAITHFUL, a dark and sexy drama about a suburban housewife (Diane Lane) who despite a perfect life with a devoted husband (Richard Gere)and loving son (Erik Per Sullivan) finds herself drifting into an affair with a sexy young book dealer (Olivier Martinez) who she meets accidentally in the city one day. Unlike FATAL ATTRACTION'S Dan Gallagher, Lane's Connie does not really go looking for this affair but finds herself inexplicably drawn to this man. Unlike Dan Gallagher, who immediately tries to end the tryst, Connie becomes completely consumed with thoughts of this man, that drive her to, among other things, public masturbation and sex in the hallway of his apartment. Their first sexual encounter so brilliantly illustrates the conflict in Connie's mind because the whole time he is undressing her and touching and caressing her, she is in tears, but she doesn't stop him either. But once Gere's husband learns of the affair, the story takes some surprising turns. This is a riveting drama anchored by Lyne's undeniable eye for what is erotic on the silver screen and a superb performance from Diane Lane, which earned the actress her first Oscar nomination. Gere is solid as the bewildered husband and Martinez is a dark and sexy leading man. The movie also features supporting bits from Chad Lowe, Margaret Colin, and Kate Burton, but it is Lyne's masterful direction and Lane's performance that are really the stars here. Don't miss this one.</fullReview>

Gere gives his usual geek performance, and Diane Lane is beautiful as usual.However, this movie has great emotion, and at times I was on the edge of my seat, with Hitchcock-like anticipation.Erik Sullivan gives a very poor performance as the son, when he could have helped the movie.All in all, it is an up and down movie with a questionable ending.

		<shortDescription>Elegant, but curiously lacking in suspense or danger...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overly-familiar and curiously bland flip-side to "Fatal Attraction" (from "Fatal" director Adrian Lyne) concerns wife and mother Diane Lane traveling from the New York suburbs into SoHo where she has a 'meet cute' with a handsome stud; she's drawn to him and soon returns, beginning a lusty secret affair that her husband may be wise to. Fails to stir up the same kind of controversy that permeated "Attraction" simply because this one isn't as well written (and is designed like a heated Harlequin romance to boot). None of this is the fault of the players: Lane (despite a penchant for making faces) is very good in the lead and Richard Gere is effectively low-keyed as her milquetoast spouse. Yet there's nothing exceptional or gripping about this story, and the final act is so colorlessly drawn-out that our sympathies ultimately shift away from the troubled couple. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had a great deal of locations in NYC, Grand Cental Station, and the lower section of Manhattan and a very depressing apartment dwelling, which was dark and dreary. However, Diane Lane,(Connie Sumner),"The Glass House",'01 was married to Richard Gere,(Ed Sumner),"Bee Season",'05, and they had a young son and lived in a very comfortable neighborhood and a doll house so to speak. Connie Sumner travels on a train into Manhattan one day and purchases various items for her son's birthday party and it is rather windy and she falls down and scrapes her knees and is helped by Oliver Martinez (Paul Martel),"Taking Lives",'04. Paul Martel is a young French man who sells books for a living and is very charming to Connie and offers to give her some bandages and some wine to help her out. This story at this point sounds like the usual routine as we have seen many times before. This film can make you feel guilty and haunted and you actually get upset with the behavior that is created in this story. The real moral of this story is simply: "What You Reap, You will Also SOW" !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a powerful movie but ultimately very disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS THROUGH:I would not call this movie great or terrible. It certainly is interesting and I suppose bold. But it's also a movie where, for me anyway, starts out close to excellent and gets worse as it goes along.I would have liked this a lot more if it had not gone the way of thriller/crime story. What was so interesting about it was the character interactions, the motivations and such. By making Gear's character murder Connie's lover it alters the focus of the film and it takes a step into Lifetime movie territory. It's a disappointing twist on what was(until that point) a genuinely compelling and engrossing film.I will admit that the movie does wrap one up in the lives of the main characters and it is almost impossible, at least for me, not to get caught up in the story. But from the very moment of the murder, the film's coarse is completely altered, the tone completely changed.The high degree of tension in watching Unfaithful is constant but strays away from the marriage itself and into the "will he get away with it" mode. How much more interesting would it have been to have the movie concentrate on a confrontation between Connie and Ed, maybe divorce plans, maybe marital therapy. It seems in EVERY movie such as this, inevitably someone gets killed. I think the movie would have been a lot more interesting overall to keep away from that avenue as it's been done and done.I also didn't think the confrontation between the two men seemed at all believable. Also something I didn't get is that some critics have said that the two main characters' marriage was normal, loving and that she just drifted into an affair for no reason. This is puzzling because I did not get the feeling that this was a perfect normal healthy relationship. Connie never seems to me to be happily in love, she seems almost dismissive of Ed. And Ed comes across as lonely and cut off from Connie. These two don't seem happy, they seem worlds apart. I would have liked the movie to stay on the subject of relationships and infidelity rather then turning Into a lifetime movie supreme.I will say that the two main performers were excellent, and that the movie is bold and provocative. It's a plus that the movie takes on the subject at all. And the ending and it's ambiguity, I must say, was very very powerful. Yet I was frustrated at the end of this and couldn't help thinking how interesting it would have been had the second half been altered, from the time Ed found out about the affair. I would have liked to see him go home and confront Connie and see how these two people ultimately resolved this. Ultimately I think Unfaithful is a dark, compelling, very sad movie that I'd rate slightly above average. My vote's 6 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes this of moderate interest is how the vision lives within ambient light and shadows, characteristic of Lyne's style. The "9 1/2 Weeks" derivations are plain, so Biziou's employment as cinematographer was no accident.The construction is somewhat obvious too: the French lover is the 'writer' who controls events (Lane). Gere is the 'director' -- evidenced by his use of a 'photographer' to 'take pictures' -- who is jealous of this control and fights to take back the 'vision'. He's particularly jealous of how the writer stole the object of desire to live with her within the joy of Tati's "Jour de Fete" (blaring at us from the movie marquee).Note the snow globe as the maguffin...a simple Hitchcock device.This wasn't bad, but there are far more intelligent predecessors out there, including "The Player" and "Presumed Innocent".</fullReview>

You don't hear anything about the private investigator he hires. If that guy is missing wouldn't that guy know that Richard genres character is the one who killed him in a jealous rage?? or how the guy Charlie fired never says anything to him about his wife, or about how when he was in the café he sees her kissing the guy who ends up missing. I bought this movie at Circuit City for 6 bucks in the bargain bin and i think it was a decent movie. It was worth that if not more. This movie leaves you thinking what happens to them? Where do they go from there? I think the characters they picked fit the role great!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a depressing but fantastic thriller, that really leaves you thinking after you are done watching it,with a gripping story and incredible performances!. All the characters are excellent, and it has so many powerful scenes in it as well, plus Diane Lane and Richard Gere are simply incredible in this!. It kept surprising me and guessing throughout, and I thought Lane and Gere had wonderful chemistry together, plus this is extremely well made and written as well. While the ending was very good, it was just so sad and hard for me to take, and I hated Olivier Martinez and Dian Lane's character for the affair in this and giving Gere so much misery, plus I recognized Erik Per Sullivan from Malcolm In The middle as he really surprised me by giving a top notch performance as the kid!. Even though Gere did commit a murder and tried to hide the body he was just so incredibly likable I rooted for him to get away with it, as he had a reason for doing it, and it has some great erotic scenes as well, plus this may be the best performance I have seen Diane Lane give!.It's certainly not a fun film to watch, and I think this should be a lot higher then 6.5 in my opinion, plus all the characters were extremely likable except for Martinez's!. To be honest I Haven't seen a whole lot of Richard Gere but he impressed the hell out of me here, and it has some uncomfortable sex scenes as well, plus it gives a good message about affairs and what they can do to your marriage and your lives!. I loved the music in it as some of it was haunting, and it's also quite suspenseful at times as well, plus it also gets to you emotionally at times as well. I had pretty high expectations for this, and I must say it surpassed them actually, and some scenes really blew me away, plus I thought that hiding the body in he dumpster was rather dumb on the character's part. This is a depressing but fantastic thriller, that really leaves you thinking after you are done watching it, with a gripping story and incredible performances, and I say go see it now!.The Direction is fantastic!. Adrian Lyne does a fantastic! job here with wonderful camera work, excellent angles adding lots of great atmosphere and keeping the film suspenseful and at an extremely engrossing pace.The Acting is incredible!. Diane Lane is amazing as always and is incredible here, she is very likable but I hated her actions and what she did to Gere, she was also vulnerable, and really gave a powerful performance, and as I said i had mixed feelings for her character, still this is most likely the best performance I have seen her give! (Lane Rules!!!!!!!). Richard Gere is also incredible here, I felt so sorry for his character and what he went through, and even though murder is wrong I couldn't help but root for him to get away with it because he was just so incredibly likable, his scene where he confronts Martinez was especially impressive(Gere Rules!!). Olivier Martinez is fantastic as the guy who is having an affair I hated his guts for what he did to the family with the affair and he was also a sleaze ball, but he played his role brilliantly I'll give him that. Erik Per Sullivan is excellent as the kid he really surprised me. Rest of the cast are fine.Overall go see it now!. ***** out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Romance, passion, seduction, and suspicion. This is a film of the times.It is set in suburban America; a wife, a husband and a son of eight years, they are a happy family with a house and two cars living an average life. One windy day, in the city, Constance (Lane) runs into a man carrying a stack of books. They knock each other over, and she ends up scraping her knee badly. After they've retrieved everything, he offers to have her come up to his apartment to clean her scrape. She reluctantly follows him, and tends to her wound.To thank him a week or two later, she comes over with some doughnuts, and he begins to seduce her, at her own will. Over the next several weeks, a romantic affair takes place, and of course never tells her husband (Gere), that she is falling in love with this boy, half her age.The rest of the movie takes its course as one might guess that it does, but the ending does have a surprise twist, and will leave you loving the film! The story is amazing, beautifully directed by Adrien Lynn (Fatal Attraction, 9 and 1/2 weeks, Flashdance), and the acting is impression beyond words. Diane Lane should have won for best actress in this, and was frankly cheated out of an Oscar in my opinion.It is an excellent film, although it is not appropriate for anyone under eighteen. It has several graphic love scenes, and violence as well. I think anyone who sees this, will be really surprised with just how good the film actually is. It's not just a romance. It's intense and interesting.</fullReview>

Diane Lane's performance is perfect - with facial expressions wonderfully conveying thoughts without dialogue. What is less convincing is the husband's preparedness to continue the marriage in the face of total betrayal - especially in view of the retribution exacted on the Lover (also a bit unconvincing with regard to the cover up attempt) Adrian Lyne's film is so much better than the original French, "La Femme Infid?le" - which suffers from the same problems, stated above, but with that version there is no information on the actual infidelity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Unfaithful" is a stylish and elegant thriller with a fantastic cast, intriguing story and interesting ending, and despite the film's length (it is a long film), does not feel long once you get into it. Diane Lane and Richard Gere star as Connie and Edward Sumner, and are a truly awesome on-screen pair. Diane Lane is a beautiful actress who carries herself well and is full of grace. I can't give her enough praise really, she is a very underrated actress, but one of the best. Richard Gere is, well, Richard Gere, excellent as usual. The first part of the film essentially focuses on Diane Lane and the affair her character has with Oliver Martinez's Paul, while the second part of the film focuses more on Richard Gere's character dealing with his wife's adultery.There isn't really much of a supporting cast in this film, aside from Oliver Martinez's character Paul, who is good, and Erik Per Sullivan, who plays Connie and Edward's son, Charlie. This is one role where Erik Per Sullivan was not as annoying as his role on "Malcolm in the Middle". The fabulous Michelle Monaghan has a very small role, while Kate Burton and Chad Lowe also make small appearances.The decisions that Diane Lane and Richard Gere's characters make in the film are always fun to watch and try and guess what they are going to do next. A decent score and nice settings add to the film's elegance. The film's ending is very interesting - leaving the ending open to the viewers to decide what happens, something not done very often in films, though here, it works just brilliantly. Very highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adrian Lyne is one of my favorite directors. His almost-perfect Blockbuster "Fatal Attraction" has met a very close match "Unfaithful". Similar story line of a passionate affair, attractive and likable characters, and lots of steamy sex scenes make this movie extremely fulfilling. Mr. Lyne, along with a good script,also masters incorporating a somewhat normal family setting in this film, making it all the more realistic. A seemingly happily married woman who's also a mother (Diane Lane) meets an intriguing French guy (Oliver Martinez) by accident. Her husband(Richard Gere), a doting father and businessman is oblivious at first to his wife's extramarital activities, but catches on later in the film. The big windstorm in the beginning where Diane Lane falls in the street, is pretty cool. Overall, I give this film 8 out of 10 stars. It falls short of the perfect 10 due to the ambiguous ending, although I understand the DVD version has an alternate ending available.</fullReview>

It looked as if Constance had the perfect life, yet she was willing to risk everything. But the truth is, she really wasn't happy. Her husband gave her the life he 'thought' she wanted. Once she got caught up, she had an out of body of experience. She didn't even know who she was anymore..wearing different kinds of clothing. She was blatantly lying to her husband and got comfortable with the fact that he would never check up on her, such the irony of her life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the third of director Adrian Lyne's films to focus on adultery, following "Indecent Proposal" and "Fatal Attraction," which convinced most men - temporarily, at least - that straying from home wasn't worth the potential consequences. In "Unfaithful," it's the wife who wanders, but the price that ultimately is paid is just as steep.Connie Sumner (Diane Lane) appears to have it all - a loving husband, a precocious son, a magnificent home in the New York City suburbs, and charity work and school projects to keep her days from becoming humdrum. During an excursion to Manhattan, on a day in which it appears tornado-force winds are threatening the city, she's knocked down and rescued by a charming book dealer, Frenchman Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez), who invites her into his Soho loft to tend to her injured knees. Despite his insinuatingly seductive ways, she departs with her morals intact, only to find herself obsessing over him in the following days. Against her better judgment, she contacts him, but guilt inhibits her from succumbing to his charms when they meet again. Not content with having avoided trouble twice, Connie returns again, and the third time surrenders to her desires, embarking on an ongoing affair that evolves from strictly physical encounters to emotional involvement.The premise of this film would have been far easier to accept had Connie been escaping from an insufferable or at least boring existence. But husband Edward is clearly attentive and romantic and - since he's played by Richard Gere - extremely attractive. He's not abusive, nor does he ignore her. After more than a decade of marriage, the two still flirt with each other like newlyweds. Connie is devoted to her son and his needs. So what exactly has drawn her into this affair? A one-shot encounter could be attributed to pure lust, but her long-term interest is difficult to understand. The couple progresses from steamy afternoons in bed to lunch in restaurants and excursions to the movies, as if they were dating with serious intentions. Given she can't confide in anyone, Connie is unable to convey to the viewer what it is that's compelling her to risk all she has. More than anything, I wanted to know why.Whatever weaknesses there are in Alvin Sargent's script are forgiven by the performances delivered by Lyne's cast. Lane is superb. On the train, heading home from yet another tryst, she wordlessly conveys her pleasure, her shame, her passion, her guilt, her every emotion playing itself out on her face in a scene that more than justifies her Oscar nomination. Gere is low-key as the cuckolded husband - even his anger is subdued - and he conveys the quiet rage simmering beneath the surface without resorting to screaming histrionics. Martinez adds dimension to his character, making him interesting enough to suggest he's more than a pretty face on the prowl.An alternate, more definitive ending was rejected in favor of the ambiguous finale we are given here, and the audience is left to decide in which direction Connie and Edward will take their marriage. What is clear is that whatever their choice, their shattered relationship will forever be haunted by her indiscretion and his reaction. Like "Fatal Attraction," "Unfaithful" serves as a loud and clear warning to all spouses tempted to stray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This quiet almost masterpiece kept me in my chair, intrigued. Until the moment where Edward picks up the snowflake globe and bashes in the head of his wife's young lover, it is her film, and like some Hardy tale, she finds herself a prisoner of an action in her past, in this case her immediate past. Then the focus shifts to her husband, not for as long a screen time as the affair, but to a second blow up, this one entirely verbal. Having noticed that her gift to the young man, the same gift Edward gave her, has appeared on her table again, she asks "What did you do with that beautiful young man? Did you hurt him?" The fury in his reply is unmistakable, and it clears the air of all the ambivalence that surrounds their lives, so that the final part of the film is about the couple, trying to patch a life together again. This is adult fare, not because of the steamy sex scenes, but for the themes and ideas brought out.Diane Lane carries the first half of the film. Richard Gere is supposed to be a cypher, a hanger-on and it is only when he sets foot into Olivier Martinez loft that he takes over the film. All three principals do a great job.Lynne and his cinematographer also set off the contrast between the world of lower Manhattan and that of Westchester County. The cut from adulterous wife getting off train to husband getting off a later train is beautifully done.This is one of the better films of the past two years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been cheated on in the past and no depiction of infidelity as tapped into the feelings surrounding this type of tragedy. One also has to wonder WHAT IF Edward (Gere) had suppressed his feelings and said simply "Don't do it again, we'll get through this" instead of the drama he unfolded. Would Diane Lane, also get over it quickly? She would feel guilty sure but I believe she would not only be comforted by this surprising reaction, but intrigued, the way she was with Paul. That kind of childish non chellance is what she needed some of. You have to feel sorry for Lane. She was seduced by a clever, fun-loving latin lover and was intrigued by his lifestyle. She showed unmistakable remorse. Would this couple ever be able to make love again? An excellent film, not to mention sexy as hell on the other end. Awesome performances, awesome direction.

		<shortDescription>What a great flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say I only caught this movie because Diane Lane is really REALLY hot. I had seen the first couple of scenes and thought that it was your typical "Basic Instinct", "A Perfect Murder" kinda thriller. I was very surprised to find that it was a lot more. This movie takes you through an entire spectrum of emotions and the ending is absolutely perfect. You will love, hate and then love Diane Lane as the movie progresses and Martinez pulls of a great performance as the young "love to hate him" fling. What wowed me the most in this film was Richard Gere. Without hardly any dialogue at all in this film, he was outstanding. The key to truly enjoying this movie is to put yourself in his shoes the entire time. I caught myself empathizing with his situation throughout the movie. All the while, their son keeps this from becoming an extremely out-of-hand cheezy thriller. The use of symbolism and foreshadowing is an added bonus. I highly recommend this movie. Not much replay value but seeing it once is enough to make you think how you would handle it. 9/10</fullReview>

Lane totally owns this film and commands the screen with her sexuality and presence. Richard Gere has a supporting role and plays the part extremely well. The film is directed by the maker of 'Fatal Attraction' and it shows. The film is at once - erotic, thrilling, real, and very interesting and thought-provoking. 'Unfaithful' is one of the best romantic thrillers of the last few years and, in Diane Lane's performance, it is one of the best acted thrillers ever. Great movie.</fullReview>

Devoted mom and happily married suburban housewife Lane goes against her better judgment when she indulges in a torrid love affair with a handsome French book dealer she meets by chance. Putting her marriage on hold, her lies and altered conduct fosters her husband's suspicion and then comes rage. Sexually charged, well acted (by Gere at his most vulnerable and notably Lane), and artfully directed by Lyne, with fascinating observations of a household and a mournful upshot, which shows this is a marital tragedy. Running Time: 123 minutes and rated R for sexuality, partial nudity, language and a scene of violence. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of America's great black comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason this film really affected me and I personally think most viewers as well as possibly the filmmakers ( although I suspect they didn't and are just playing a big joke on you all) have missed the entire point of this film. This movie is not supposed to be taken seriously. From the opening "big wind " shot its obvious that we are in a hyper-real world. Richard Gere's character hasn't done anything to warrant putting him in the kind of situation he finds himself in. He's a nice guy who cares about his family. Diane Lane is having a fling. Why ? Who knows? I guess she's caught up in the moment. The third act is when the black comedy aspects come into play. Gere leaves as much evidence as he destroys and on top of everything else puts the corpse in the trunk of his car and then , apparently, dumps it in the town dump in his own hometown miles away from the crime scene. On top of everything else he and the arcass get stuck in the elevator which should be a big tip off that we're not in the real world. Yes, the ending is a cheat and ambiguous but it really isn't. Watch the scenes with the NYPD homicide detectives closely. They aren't dummies and its obvious they are on to something. Based on the time line even with an ambigous ending its obvious these guys are coming back, probably on New Years Eve and Gere is going to be arrested. He's their suspect. They've got all kinds of evidence and from the moment they enter the picture its apparent they aren't just fishing. They know what happened here. Director Adrian Lyne just doesn't show it to the viewer but his detectives know who committed this murder. They know it from that first visit.</fullReview>

It also talks about how this film was made and organized, which you will appreciate very much (if you are fond of this film).Even though this movie is based on our daily lives and events, the director (he calls himself a selector) develops the excellence of film. Every single simple shot in the movie is very intricate with a lot of metaphors. These metaphors are not hard to understand at all but very well-thought.The director says that when audiences watch this film, they will feel somewhat alike and . you feel like you are there. Yes I did, I did not realize it until I saw the ending of the movie. The director did very well on the cutting and adding of the film while the casts performed their parts perfectly, they are just so right for the roles.Thanks to Diane Lane, Richard Gere, Olivier Martinez, Erik Per Sullivan.This movie is over 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adrian Lyne Smokes back the Erotic Thriller (with style)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Final Score: 9.1 (out of 10)- Warning: Spoilers Ahead -`Unfaithful', based on the French film `Le Femme Infidele', manages to successfully bring back the erotic thriller ? and do so largely resisting the Lifetime TV movie clichés of the genera. It isn't trashy or pandering, but an adult, intelligent, classy, atmospheric thriller. It also does what Barry Levinson's spineless adaptation of Michael Crichton's `Disclosure' (1994) failed to do at the time - truly flip those pesky politically correct gender roles all the way around. In `Unfaithful' one could say that the gimmick is that this time it's the women (and not just a woman, but a wife and mother) who cheats on her family with a mysterious, manipulative French book dealer (Olivier Martinez). She does it not to spite her husband, but for the danger of it, her own selfish thrill. Working with a women, the movie is able to swing it's moods wildly from one unbelievable extreme to the next without any rhyme or reason and make it seem believable. She has a strange dichotomy the entire affair: she seems to be in love with him, thinking about him as soon as she wakes in the morning and at the same time goes home crying every night. Repeat. Her motivations are all her own, senseless, left for the viewer to plug in their own bitter life experiences to these situations and interpret for themselves. Many of the sex scenes seem to start out as if it's going to be a rape, but then, in a sequence to really get the feminists spinning on their heels, our heroine is shown actually wanting it. Hard, angry and passionate. Then it has the guts to really twist in the guilt and betrayal with the characterization of her husband. Played by Richard Gere (in regular guy mode), he is not an insensitive, violent dolt, but a romantic, loving guy whom she would have no reason to cheat on. Wow, I wonder why this movie wasn't protested. This is a movie of complexity in a world where these type of characters would typically be reduced to one-note instantly relatable stereotypes. Very admirable and refreshing. Few actresses could pull of this dichotomous anti-hero that we hate one moment and feel for the next, but Diane Lane (still gorgeous, no `for her age' about it) does so in spades. But as the film's power shifts from one character to the other, Richard Gere comes out giving an equally powerful performance. Up until this year I've not been a fan of Gere's but with his remarkable turns in both this and `Chicago' I'm re-thinking my stance. Rounding out the cast flawlessly is young Eric Per Sullivan (`Malcolm in the Middle`), Zeliko Ivanek (`24`) and Gary Basaraba (`Boomtown`). The first half of the film is intoxicating in it's atmosphere. Alvin Sargent &amp; William Broyle's screenplay doesn't ring a false note in the dialogue. It lingers in simple moments of the families everyday life flowed together wonderfully with Lyne's incredible visual style and Jan Kaczmarek's (not `Malcolm in the Middle`) orchestrated score. And yet it still revels in the guilty pleasure of Connie having a quickie in a cafe bathroom while her friends sit around waiting for her. It about lost me halfway through as it takes an out of place twist into the standard conclusion drawn by movies like this. It's not enough for the women to be the soul villain of the piece; her husband has to do something even worse. I was hoping this was going to be the one big affair movie that doesn't involve a murder that spins the movie away from the the characters. When it does, I was detached and profoundly disappointed. In these moments it becomes like a cross between Andrew Davis' `A Perfect Murder' and `Fargo' where we are subjected to macabre moments of Richard Gene dragging a dead body wrapped in carpet to the trunk of his car and covering up the murder weapon (an object so basic yet uncommon that it feels like it's out of a film noir classic). But as it proceeds towards it's ambiguous and perfectly realized end, it slowly won me back. The tension of the film comes from the performances of Lane and Gere as power and knowledge is shifted and hidden between the couple, not from crime or stalker movie conventions. Hitchcock would be proud. When moments of confrontation come they are not unsatisfying - the big confrontation (you know which one) coming with a use of light and shadow so expertly crafted it is almost scary. Lyne ratchets up the intensity by having the reality of their deeds threaten to slip in and intrude upon their parties, dinner table conversation and break apart the appearance of happiness in their suburban lives. It's concept is daring and original and even when `Unfaithful' takes toward more familiar ground it is still so well done it remains a first class psychological drama.</fullReview>

The intense sexual interplay that goes on between the cheating Lane and Martinez was well done and directed so well you begin to get a glimpse of what cheating is all about. Sex. Unfortunately, Richard Gere is a difficult person to feel sympathetic towards due to his rat face. Besides that, the movie is completely directionless after a pointless climax.

		<shortDescription>Real and Provoking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfaithful would simply give a behaviouristic psychology class subject matter for an entire semester. It's a film depicting the "real", where each character's emotional expressions and both intended and coincidental situations speak volumes. There are a lot of subtleties and reflections going on, for example, the conversation between the ladies at the pub. This film is made to provoke, and it does just that whether you like it in the end or not. I think, in probably most cases, that male and female viewers will have different feelings and responses to this film. I identified mainly with Gere's character, not because I've been through something like this but because I'm a married man. So, I saw his side of the experience, his suffering and pain and sudden loss of the life he'd had. And then he does everything wrong, everything wrong that "real" (not smart) people have done. But all of the characters could be analyzed both sympathetically and not. That's what makes them "real". That's what makes you watch the film all the way through. Most viewers won't like the ending, which is intended to provoke, and I'd be lying if I said it didn't nettle me, but how else would it end really? No one can honestly say that the acting is bad, I mean look at who we have here. Still, I want to not like this film, but I guess I have to acknowledge the intelligence at work here and give it credit of course for being so explicitly lewd.</fullReview>

For those who haven't seen it as yet, I won't give away the ending but I didn't expect it to end that way but it was still a good ending. The scene where the police question Connie, it was so good because you could tell that her husband knew she was lying and she knew that he knew that she was not telling the truth. Overall, this movie is definitely worth watching. It is very much like a suspense but really erotic. Adrian Lyne does a good job of directing a well written script. Diane Lane, I have nothing but respect for her, I think she's a very talented actress who is gonna be around for a long time. Olivier Martinez, only one word to describe his performance, SEXY.

Nota bene to Lyne---If you're going to have the camera linger for a moment on a big shiny kitchen knife in an apparently wasted homage to "Fatal"...then please have the common courtesy to STICK THE DAMNED THING INTO ONE OF YOUR CHARACTERS AT SOME APPROPRIATE JUNCTURE IN THE FILM...otherwise, leave the cutlery on the editing room floor where it belongs.

		<shortDescription>Diane Lane saves it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever you have a movie dealing with husband or wife's unfaithfulness, what makes them different and interesting is the way those affairs are being resolved (or not resolved). This movie failed to give any meaningful and original ending. And the originality usually comes from the scenes when the husband encounters "the other" guy (or the wife the other woman) and when the spouses meet after the affair is being revealed. At both those moments this movie fails to deliver. The rest is just a padding.***SPOILERS AHEAD***The beginning of the meeting between the husband and the lover of his wife was OK. Both the french guy and Gere played their roles very well, all this up to the moment he kills him. Come on, there should be a better and more convincing way to do this. Gere looked like an old woman trying to kill a fly on the wall. And what was the thing with the elevator an with getting rear-ended at his son's school? Completely unnecessary. And the scene with them both and the cops. It was so obvious that she was hiding something and the cops did nothing. Finally when she find out that he knew and their dialogue the night after the party. These are moments when that kind of movie should come up with something interesting and new but instead "I gave you everything and you f***** another man" and that's it. Gere cried like a baby. Come on.It was more like a documentary than a movie. Unless you wanna see Diane Lane in a few sex scenes half naked, just don't bother watching this one. I mean, she played well (especially the scene in the train) but this was far from enough to save the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has Adrian Lyne's signature all over it. He also directed NINE 1/2 WEEKS, FATAL ATTRACTION, and INDECENT PROPOSAL, among others. But as far as the story is concerned, this one is the weakest. If it weren't for the steamy sex scenes, the film will be utterly dull and boring. This won't be the first movie ever made about a wife's infidelity, the problem is that there is no obvious explanation for it. Is she unsatisfied with her husband's relationship? Apparently not. Is she doing it for revenge? Doesn't look like. The only plausible reason is that she got swept by the young fellow's charm. No obsessive behavior like in FATAL ATTRACTION or no financial interest like in INDECENT PROPOSAL. Half way through, the movie takes a spin, which is a good idea because it would've prevented the audience from getting bored, like I did in the middle of NINE 1/2 WEEKS. And it has more sensible ending, as oppose to the "Friday the 13th" one from FATAL ATTRACTION.The most intriguing character, nevertheless, is the husband (Richard Gere). He is portrayed as an aggressive businessman, and yet he is low-keyed the rest of the time.This is a movie that deserves to be seen only because of the great performance by Dianne Lane.</fullReview>

Olivier Martinez is one of the sexiest menIve ever seen and a damn fine actor which makes me desire and envy himat the same time. Richard Gere is a great actor who deserves more filmslike this that showcase his range and ability. I love that this film ismade for mature intelligent adults and not some dumbed down soft coreporn aimed at horny teenage boys. The story is solid, the direction isterrific, and Unfaithful will be remembered as one of Diane's bestfilms......................................</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*****SPOILERS****** It is hard to choose between "Unfaithful" and "A Walk On The Moon" as to which is Diane Lanes greatest performance. She is the consummate unfaithful wife, no one could do it better. "Unfaithful" has three or four scenes that I don't believe anyone else could have played. The train scene is the most remarkable bit of acting I have ever seen. Her facial and body expressions are unbelievably convincing and the first seduction scene, showing her body shuddering, is riveting.My other favorite scenes are the dry cleaning store when she discovers that her husband is on to her, and the scene in their home when he is making small talk and she is watching him like a trapped animal. However, in both AWOTM and "Unfaithful" the husbands reactions are not realistic. Any man, upon discovering that his wife has been unfaithful would want to know how many other men she has been intimate with and for how long. He would certainly question the paternity of their children. I get the feeling in both these movies that Lyne is trying to make the unfaithful wife a sympathetic character and the husbands the guilty ones.Connies obsession with the sexual predator (and that is the only way he could be described) is not quite understandable as she descends into behavior that makes her character totally unsympathetic. The restaurant rest room scene and her later query , "did you just **** me across the street", along with the rear ending in the hall, showed her as crass and vulgar. All in all it was an absolutely mesmerizing movie that will be a classic for years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There can be few actresses as good as Diane Lane. I thought she was great in 'A Walk On The Moon', 'The Perfect Storm' and many of her others, but in 'Unfaithful'!!?? Well... she completely rocks. She is so sexy, yet at the same time she is so sympathetic and vulnerable. This is a stellar performance that should put her high on the Hollywood A-List. The film is built entirely around Lane's character and I was pleased about that as her character is the focus of the film. A very well made and involving adultery drama with Lane in stunning form.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DIANE LANE (The Perfect Storm, Judge Dredd) is perfect in this sizzling film by the director of 'Fatal Attraction'. No wonder Lane won so many awards and an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. This is a great performance that dominates the film. The scene on the train ride home after her first tryst with the sexy Frenchman is already a classic scene and this performance will be remembered forever. The film itself is very stylish and very well made, but it is the amazing acting that raises it well above the average. Watch for the cute kid Dewey from 'Malcolm In The Middle' who plays Diane Lane's son in the film. Highly recommended for those who appreciate great acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's really hard to separate Diane Lane's performance from this almost saccharine, overly cloying movie that broadcasts in the loudest terms possible a series of events that shout to be heard but leave a strange, bewildering flavor. This couple must be one of the dumbest husband and wife teams alive with the biggest misfortune of circumstances and odd coincidences to come along in a long time. The scriptwriters failed at their task of making a believeable, thoughtful movie about extra-marital affairs. And the ending is one of those leave it to the viewer to decide what happens kind of endings letting the movie off the hook of committing itself to sending any sort of message. Diane Lane's performance, thusly, is strangely difficult to judge. Her Oscar-nomination for best actress is confounded by a relatively limp character which doesn't even suggest and hint at the thoughts or desires leading up to her ultimate seduction. In fact there is more about the other gentlemen and photography from his perspective to suggest more about him than about Diane Lane. Diane seems to keep bumping into the wrong people at the wrong time. The other man seems just to ask for it, as dumb as he seemed to be about his predicament and it isn't really ever even explicitly demonstrated that the other man is really a cad or not. Overall this movie is a pretty much of a mess of obvious photographic shots that scream at you about what's going on or omitting crucial pieces of information. The strongest element of this movie is Diane Lane's performance in her role in the throes of sexual ecstasy. She captures a sensual waif who really offers up one of the best, non-pornographic performances about the thrill and excitement of sexual hunger and primal erotic passion caught on screen. Whether such a performance justifies her Oscar nomination is another matter. Four stars out of ten.</fullReview>

UNFAITHFUL stands well and truly on it's own with some very unique and interesting twists on the whole infidelity thriller genre. DIANE LANE is the star of the film and she acts exceptionally here (surely deserving of an Oscar nomination at minimum). RICHARD GERE is also very good in a role so very different from what we expect. OLIVIER MARTINEZ is gorguous and holds his own against the two Hollywood heavyweight stars. The film is exceptional from the well staged start to the breathtaking (if ambiguous) ending. Brilliant and well worth buying or renting on a feature packed DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the likes of Richard Gere and Diane Lane on the marquee, you're bound to get good results. And you do. With the added dash of spice in the performance of newcomer, Olivier Martinez, as the young lover.This run of the mill story line was written by Alvin Sargent and William Broyles Jr. adapted from Claude Chabral's LA FEMME INFIDELE. It's the performers that bring this to life, along with fine direction by Adrian Lyne, who also acted as the producer.This is Lane's picture. For certainly it gives her the chance to draw up such strong emotional feelings. Looking totally gorgeous, she runs the gamut from fear and guilt to sexual gutteral behavior. Her highly charged explicit sex scenes with Martinez lit up the screen. Then she turns around and works the scenes with her husband, Gere, with great depth. Bravo, Miss Lane. Richard Gere gives a very underrated performance as the husband who has no control of his hurts and shame when he discovers his wife's disloyalty. The scene when he begins to doubt her honesty is a brilliant acting job. His scene in confronting the lover was also incredibly honest and heartbreaking. I'm not sure I liked the result, story wise, but that's what they wrote, folks.Olivier did a beautiful job, holding his own opposite such powerhouses as Lane and Gere. He gave the lover a lovely simplicity with a touch of that young cocky ego that goes with his type of character. The big wind scene in the opening that brings the lovers together was a bit too much, but, what the heck, let's get this film off to a stormy beginning, which could also set the mood of what's to come. Erik Per Sullivan, as the son to Gere and Lane, seemed miscast. He didn't even resemble either of them and at times seemed almost retarded.In summation, seeing the works of the major leads is well worth viewing this film. And Diane Lane should be nominated for this performance. Don't understand why she wasn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flat, Boring 'Sub-Urban Drama'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The American cinema has developed in the last few year a new concept - the 'sub-urban drama'. Usually located in New Jersey, or some other NYC periphery, it tries to play on the differences between the Big City temptations and the spleen of the out-town. The concept played quite well in 'American Beauty' and in the Red Bank series, but enough is enough. 'Unfaithful' tries to combine the genre with the erotic and cross-cultural drama, and the result is .. well, not more exciting than life in New Jersey.The movie could have been a better one, if the theme of the cultural differences between the American wife looking for some extra-marital excitement, but preempted to taste the sweet taste of sin because of the puritan background she lives in, and the French divorcee's conception 'taste life as it is' was explored more in depth. Unfortunately, nothing is deep in this movie, and we probably need to wait for the French remake for some real characters truth. Instead of artistic truth, what we get for our money is just another Hollywood morality lesson.Diane Lane's act is good, and as result of the platitude of the rest, it comes as shining in other viewers reviews. However, she is far from an Oscar-winning performance. The end is absolutely amazing, in the bad sense unfortunately - more than ten minutes of pure bore, adding nothing to the film. Get out of the theater earlier, you will miss nothing!5/10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very disappointing and unbelievable. The absurdity of it was completely distracting. From the initial accidental meeting, to Diane Lane's immediate obsession, right through to the end, and Richard Gere's sudden emotional outburst - it was all ridiculous and horribly predictable. Hasn't this movie been made 100 times before - and often much more effectively? Lane and Gere didn't have one real conversation throughout the first 7/8 of the film, yet they were supposed to be in love - how do we know? Once the affair started, they barely spoke to one another, yet Gere never asked "what's wrong?" if they were so in love, where was the ability to talk, esp. in the beginning? I found the characters one-dimensional and boring. While Diane Lane's performance was excellent, it's too bad it was wasted in such an awful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in the day, you could count on Adrian Lyne to deliver slickly titillating treatises on the perils of women, whether it be the naive heroine of `9 ? Weeks' or the gullible homemaker of `Indecent Proposal' all the way to the desperate shrew of `Fatal Attraction'. But nowadays, Lyne's mining of the territory seems outdated and empty and with `Unfaithful' he's delivered the R-rated equivalent of a made-for-Lifetime movie. Diane Lane, trying to play against her good-girl image (she seems to have taken the role strictly for the notoriety), stars as a housewife who falls under the sway of a hunky French book dealer (Olivier Martinez) and must suffer the wrath of her husband's retribution. (Richard Gere plays her spouse and he's terrible as usual--as an actor, he doesn't think, he just reacts.) Based on a film by Claude Chabrol (`La Femme Infidele', unseen), Lyne does allow for some steamier sex scenes than he's provided in his other pictures but they're diminished by his moral branding of the events; with Lane's perceived lack of any motivation other than lust in succumbing to her affair, everything is smugly but loudly labeled `Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!' so that the audience can feel the same sense of superiority the director does--he seems to have no sympathy for her whatsoever. Though `Unfaithful' has a graceful, distinctive look to it (it's shot by Peter Biziou, who filmed `Time Bandits' and `Pink Floyd The Wall') and has some pedigree behind its writers (Alvin Sargent and William Broyles Jr.), it's diminished by the low-wattage star power of the performers: they may look good but really--are these the kind of people you want to watch having sex?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILER WARNING*** If you've seen the trailers you already know the plot; bored wife takes a lover and all hell breaks loose. This was a well-crafted piece in terms of dialogue, acting, likeable and many-faceted characters...the only problem, for me anyway, was the non-ending. As a writer, I prefer my pieces to have three components: beginning, middle and end. The words "the end" on the screen do not constitute an ending, and following the lead of other non-hit movies like The Pledge, this movie leaves the viewer hanging. Will he turn himself in? Will they run away to Mexico? Does anyone care? It's possible that the research they've done shows that the only way to please the entire audience is to let them make up their own endings; but to me this shows a complete lack of confidence in the work. The best movies ever made (i.e., Fight Club, Usual Suspects, etc.) have a specific ending and no major loose ends left untied.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An admirer of Adrian Lyne's work and ditto for Mr "Breathless" the best thing I can say about this is that finally it stopped! and that's all it did - it doesn't even finish!Screaming out for automatic inclusion in the "Why did they bother?" category, this total waste of 126 minutes at no stage justifies its existence except perhaps for the entrenched voyeur who may well get his (or her) rocks off watching Miss Lane being stripped, fondled, and otherwise grotesquely pleasured. Way LESS ultimately than the sum of its parts, UNFAITHFUL presents the audience with less than nothing. Who cares if after 11 years of serially boring marriage to poor old Rich, Ms Lane decides to have a fling with seedy book-trader Olivier Martinez who runs a smooth line in Cornel Wilde French accents. A wannabe LAST TANGO IN SOHO Monsieur Martinez doesn't even keep a bar of soap on hand!So what if Lyne goes to some trouble to give us a seemingly happy Gere household - these are dull and uninvolving people. Has anyone in the history of movies ever come across a less charismatic child than Erik per Sullivan? Jeez, I take back all I said about Daniel Radcliffe!Lyne crosses the line between artistic merit and absurd self-indulgence here and despite Gere's unwavering credibility (His long-time-coming outburst at his wife's infidelity is the one redeeming highlight of the movie!) there is never anything TO this story! Logically, the Police would have had an airtight case, DNA match and motive established by breakfast. Lyne doesn't seem to have the slightest notion of where he's finally going with this and thus the chronically unsatisfying if not straight-up laughable last scene.Lyne was at the top of his tree with JACOB'S LADDER. Doesn't appear he'll ever be reaching THOSE heights again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superior and effective thriller with superb acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone expecting an old rehashed, run-of-the-mill thriller will be disappointed, because "UNFAITHFUL" is one of the best and most impressive thrillers so far this decade.The film is so effecting and haunting that you will not easily forget having seen it. Having said that, it still manages to be entertaining and, even at times, quite amusing.The film is very much a film of two halves. The first half shows us Diane Lane's Connie falling for a handsome French bookdealer. They have an affair and start to get 'braver' with where they flirt. The second half is about the repercussions of the affair and what happens when Richard Gere's husband finds out.Both halves are superbly shot and brilliantly acted. Especially Diane Lane who must surely be nominated for an Academy Award for this amazing performance. She is so convincing and heart-breakingly real in this film that it even puts her great performance in "A Walk On The Moon" into the shade.Gere is also good, particularly in the second half of the film. Olivier Martinez as the handsome French bookdealer admirably does what he is there to do. i.e. Make the females in the audience get hot. He is one good-looking and charming dude!"Unfaithful" is a whole notch above the usual Hollywood thriller. It is interesting, cool, entertaining and effective. I whole-heartedly recommend this film as one of the best thrillers so far this decade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>UNFAITHFUL is a very engrossing, gripping and well made drama about the dangers of infidelity and the repercussions of peoples actions. It is without doubt one of the best films of it's kind and has already been a huge 'hit' both critically and commercially. What really sets UNFAITHFUL apart from other 'erotic thrillers' is the Academy Award worthy performance of the films star DIANE LANE. It is a breathtaking performance that is worth the price of admission alone. RICHARD GERE also does well in a role that is very different from his usual 'gigolo' image. OLIVIER MARTINEZ's hunky and charming Frenchman also makes a strong impression. This is DIANE LANE's film though and it is a great female role that LANE manages to completely and convincingly carry-off. Great acting in a wonderful film. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

I know it had a steamy screenplay. Especially when Diane Lane was cheating her husband Richard Gere all day. I am sure he asked her please, please don't go away or else she is giving him the blues. Maybe! She would lie with every word she said, and Gere thought of better times of yesterday but now she is tied down to her new loverboy Olivier Martinez rules.(Third Verse) Before the Oscars get set in motion, before they vote for something more, I hope they consider Diane Lane's performance and make a notion but I guess we will have to wait for what's in store.(Chorus) Cause you gotta see `Unfaithful', you gotta see `Unfaithful'.**** Good</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting look at infidelity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This infidelity yarn which is actually better than expected is no doubt due to the fine performances and chemistry of the two leads - Diane Lane and Richard Gere. Lane is more than sexy as the spouse who wanders and Gere surprisingly shines as the curious turned jealous then obsessive hubby in a story that takes a different and unexpected twist. An additional twist (if I may play with words) is the formidable tryst who is admirably played by the Frenchman Olivier Martinez. This versatile French actor may have dipped into a bit of his personal past when he sparred in the ring as a boxer to exchange both physical and more notably, mental blows with the respective leads. "Unfaithful" also has director Adrien Lynne returning to the infidelity theme he was successful in both his 1993 "Indecent Proposal" as well as his 1987 triumph, "Fatal Attraction" which is widely recognized as a landmark of the genre. He also attempts to surpass the steamy scenes from an earlier film - 9 1/2 Weeks - that infamously gave him notoriety among film censors but thankfully in this 2002 release the passion is far less bizarre while still being on quite sensual and passionate.</fullReview>

It is a very realistic and human film, that benefits from a superb Oscar calibre performance by the stunning Diane Lane. A very well-made and well-acted film that is quite haunting in it's execution. Definitely one of the years best films so far. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All of the elements of this film are well done, but what really makesit special is the performance of Diane Lane. The superb mixture ofmature sexuality and acting skill show why Lane is the mostunderappreciated actress in Hollywood. Why she has not beengetting the kinds of roles that Jennifer Lopez seems to have a lockon is beyond me. I hope the Academy will look Lane's way comeOscar time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BEST thriller of the year so far. "UNFAITHFUL" is unforgettable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I loved about this movie is that it is an INTELLIGENT thriller for people who like their movies thought-provoking and meaningful. "UNFAITHFUL" is also a very entertaining and watchable film. Not because of the much publicized Diane Lane nudity issue, but because it has a subtle gripping effect that gets you hooked and refuses to let you go. It is almost hauntingly hypnotizing in a very engrossing and gripping way. Adrian "Fatal Attraction" Lyne's movie is further enhanced by brilliant performances by a top-level cast in great form. Richard Gere has never been better than this, and Diane Lane is simply a revelation. The acting is brilliant all round, and the final act is very intelligent and unpredictable. I have to say that I loved this movie so much, that it is in my mind... the best film of the year. Unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I loved this film so much. UNFAITHFUL could well be one of the best thrillers ever made. It isn't a thrill-a-minute thriller, but it builds slowly and suspensefully to a great, intelligent conclusion that will have you talking for days. The acting by Diane Lane was out-of-this-world, and I'm so thrilled for her that she has got so much recognition for her amazing work here. Richard Gere also gives the performance of his career. A great thriller with a coolness that normally only a Steven Soderbergh film can have. A winner and a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found myself liking this film so much more than I thought I would. It is one of those films that grabs you early on and doesn't let go. Even after the end credits have rolled you still find yourself haunted by the films terrific story and amazing performances. You'll also find yourself in the "what would you have done" discussion mode. This film is extremely well done indeed. The direction is classy, the story is haunting, the performances are first rate, and the ending is superb. I can't honestly remember a better 'star-making' performance by a lead actress than the one given in 'Unfaithful' by Diane Lane. She becomes Constance and has you wholeheartedly believing her. Every facial expression, every line and word delivered is flawless. Diane Lane gives an Academy Award worthy performance if I have ever seen one. Richard Gere is also surprisingly effective in a powerful support role. The French guy was also strong although, this is Diane Lane's show without doubt. I really recommend this film very highly indeed. Haunting, intense, subtle and beautiful. If it wasn't for all the great reviews and 'buzz' that this film has received, it would have been The surprise of the year. As it stands, it is every bit as good as people say. A haunting and beautiful masterpiece!10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We have now seen UNFAITHFUL twice and it was as brilliant second time as it was first. This is a wonderful film. It is a quality film that is sexy, cool, thought provoking and entertaining. You'll not see better acting than Diane Lane all year! She is perfection. A terrific film no matter how many times you see it. It stills grips you, entertains you, provokes you, and leaves you thinking about it. Like all great films it has something about it that just makes it memorable, sensual and great. One of the years best without a doubt, and possibly one of the best of the 2000's as well. A class, quality film that leaves it's mark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a move elicits feelings that you didn't even know still existed within you, then I think you can qualify that for a good, if not excellent, movie. Richard Ghere was not portrayed in his normal typecast role, but definitely portrayed what you would feel in that situation. And Olivier Martinez, oh my god, let's not even go there. There are times when you are older, when you feel you don't elicit or contain such feelings, then you see them portrayed on the screen, and you realize they are just suppressed. After I left the theatre, I could not even convey my emotions. Let me just say, Richard Ghere was excellent, Diane Lane was me, which was excellent, and Olivier Martinez was beyond my imagination. This was definitely the best movie I have seen in, what do they say, I cannot remember when. It exceeded my expectations and imagination of what I expected of this movie. I will sum this up. I took my 75 year old mother in a wheelchair to this movie, who wanted to see it because of the previews, wheeled her out, she said it was okay ( but continued to talk about it, realize that she has had a stroke), and I have been stunned for days. It really captures your imagination and, being 40 plus, recognizes that sexuality does not end in your twenties. Help me, do you know if Olivier might hire out? For the directors or producers credits, filming it with the storm, wind or dreary days really officiated all of the mood of the film, i.e. sex, romance, murder. As I previously stated, best film I have seen in a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes, a person sees an artwork at the right time in his or her life, and it just makes the perfect entrance so that everything is suddenly different. Unfaithful affected me in this way. It is simply amazing, from start to finish. It made me think about everything, about life, and what i want, and love and passion and art and my future...it made me become emotionally attached to the characters, speculate about them for forever... I've never seen a movie more than once in the theatre, except Brotherhood of the Wolf, which I saw twice....but I just watched Unfaithful for the third time tonight. And I'm still thinking about it. I've been thinking about it, and about things in my life for this past week, since I saw it for the first time on Thursday... It was just a slap in the face, made underlying things that i had previously questioned come to light, and it's made me ponder my position on other situations...this movie has seriously moved me, and really has changed my life. I urge anyone and everyone to go out and see it right away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING-IRREVERENT REVIEW of "UNFAITHFUL"To borrow from Oscar Wilde it would take a man/woman with a heart of stone to watch the unfolding marital drama of Connie (Diane Lane) and Ed (Richard Gere) and not laugh.Here we have a beautiful, mid-thirtyish, smart Westchester County (N.Y.) housewife married to the owner of a company that does something (legal) with fleets of armored cars. We see enough of him at work to know he's tough, committed, savvy. But he's not chained to the office. He's an involved parent and a loving hubby easily aroused by his wife. Their kid, Charlie (Erik per Sullivan) is so realistically around eight-years-old that I wondered if they bothered giving him a script.So what does this bright woman do with her time? She hunts for items for charity events and hits on acquaintances for donations. On a sunny but very windy day her trek for dreck brings her into Manhattan. I've seen days that windy here but usually with a hurricane. This one ain't believable but so what?The wind (instead of the syrupy music that accompanies married woman meets un-suave European dirtbag that great song, "They Call the Wind Maria," would have been a terrific choice) blows Connie into the arms, then into the apartment, then later into the bed of this guy, Paul Martel (was his name yet another shameless cinematic commercial plug?). Well, it isn't windy every time she goes to see him but you get the idea. Martel is well and greasily played by Oliver Martinez. The only redeeming feature of their torrid lovemaking for me is that this guy's place is just like mine - books absolutely everywhere. But not anyone like Diane Lane. :(What follows is not "Fatal Attraction," it's very well acted Immature Distraction. The gal from Ardsley gets super-O's from the book dealer but there's no indication she was suffering from coital neglect back at the ranch. Is she just bored? Has she no values? Does she really yearn to live again in Manhattan (a subtle sub-plot. Very subtle.)?Richard Gere and Diane Lane ARE outstanding. Much more so than the story. Some commentators have opined that "Unfaithful" is yet another snipe at suburbia. Maybe it is: can the truth be told too many times? What is gloriously clear (and true in my biased opinion) is that the Manhattan scenes convey a heck of a lot more life than those shot in the arid but affluent suburb where much of the film was filmed.Acting: 8/10. Story: 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like all the actors and they did a fine job I suppose, but two major things bother me about this movie that made it predictable for me.First, I was never given a "good" reason why Diane Lanes character had to cheat on her husband other than she hates the suburbs and is bored with her husband (Richard Gere), who appeared charming as always in the film. I lacked depth in Diane Lane's character.Secondly, the murder scene was not believable. Two hits on the head with a snow globe decoration without it breaking to me signified that this script or direction wasn't prepared thoroughly.Overall, it lacked character depth, for I had no idea why I had to be sympathetic for these people as the movie went on.Such is the way when French stories get re-made in America. I would not recommend this film, and can't believe it got award nominations.</fullReview>

Take for instance the 'tragedy' of the bags of groceries falling over and then not one but two cuts of oranges rolling around the back of her SUV as she races into the city.Pure drama! Spilled fruit rolling around the back of an SUV.Then, Richard Gere as a coward. He goes to confront the man (guess what he's not married to you and the problem is with your slutty wife and your ability to keep her happy.) If you want to slam someone's head with a snow globe either do it to your wife or the head of your own ineffectual penis.Dialogue, plot and editing made this film a complete waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know a lot of people who disliked this movie, and I'm one of them. We fall into two camps; people who were expecting a relationship movie but got a thriller, and people who were expecting a thriller but got a relationship movie. I fall into the latter group.I won't summarise the plot, that's been done. Let's just say that the main problem with this flick is that it doesn't know what it's trying to be. Is it Fatal Attraction with a more sympathetic third wheel, or is it Terms of Endearment with a murder? Whichever it's trying to be, IMO it mostly fails. I gave the movie a rating of 5/10 because I only give *really* low ratings to totally crap flicks (which this wasn't), but IMO it really isn't much of a film.The other problem with the movie is the two leads. Now I'm partially biased because I really really don't like Diane Lane, but geez, she's such a cold fish in this flick. My mom and I were discussing the movie and she said something interesting... I was telling her how I just thought her preoccupation with her paramour was not believable, and my mom said it was like she was in a 'sexual thrall'... she wasn't in love, she wasn't infatuated, she wasn't even in lust: she was enthralled. What does that mean? Well, if you don't understand, chat me and I'll give you my mom's phone number, you can call her and ask. I can't explain it but it makes sense to me.But IMO the problem isn't just Ms Lane, it's her costar (don't remember the dude's name, the lover). He's cute and all, but to me he's just so, so, so un-sensual, unattractive, and completely unbelievable as a home-wrecker. I can't imagine *ever* risking my marriage for someone like him. In fact, the only scenes where he seems comfortable and attractive are his scenes with Richard Gere.Actually, Ms Lane seems not bad in her scenes with other actors, either, it's just with him that she seems totally unbelievable.On the plus side, Richard Gere was pretty good and the city looked great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie does not present a persuasive argument for a woman married to a handsome, sexually active man to cheat on him (presumably for the first time); a man whom she loved. I believe without a compelling reason, the movie is seriously flawed. Furthermore, when she saw her lover with another girl and instead of breaking up with him to end an affair that made her miserable, she has sex with him. I am not really sure that a souvenir glass bowl is a strong enough tool to kill a healthy young man without even breaking. By the way, why would any woman give her lover a souvenir snow dome that her husband bought for his home?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfaithful is the best film that Adrian Lyne has done since he started as a director. I have seen some of his movies and I think that Unfaithful is his best work. The story is similar to Fatal Attraction's story, but Unfaithful is better than the another film, because it is centered in the drama and the suffering that Connie feels and the suffering that Edward feels when he has discovered the truth. Olivier Martinez plays an excellent Paul Martel "The lover" who offers her sexual things than anything else. Fatal Attraction in centered more in Alex Forrest's madness (Glenn Close) and in the dangerous suspense that makes them live, Unfaithful shows the dramatical part of a marriage that stars not to work very well and the suspense part when Edward (Richard Gere)goes meeting her wife's lover, but it doesn't finish very well. In this film you can see a wonderful Diane Lane who takes all the applause with her performance of Connie Sumner and received a very deserved nomination to an Academy Award. A great Richard Gere in the best performance of his all career, and Olivier Martinez who has played very well the character of Connie's Lover. In the poster, if you look at it very carefully, you can see Connie's feelings represented by the darkness and the lightness that you see. If you like good dramas and Adrian Lyne's movies you have to see Unfaithful. My score: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why you should never pay the-wages-of-sin with a credit card!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoilers sign posted*A seemingly happy middle class family home is thrown in to chaos when the wife has an affair with a younger man.I can now claim to have seen all of Adrian Lyns's movies and while admitting that he has never quite hit the heights, they are all watchable. Even his teen melodrama debut, Foxes, which probably influenced quite a bit of trashy US TV.The only thing I don't like about him is that he seems a bit too influenced by soft-porn, which he thinks becomes all arty if he photographs it in natural light!Before viewing this I thought this was going to another wages-of-sin epic and came with a heavy heart, but I was quietly surprised. The handling of the production and the quality of the acting kept me on-board and asking questions to the very end. A bit of over melodramatic it may be, but very - in outline principle - believable. Richard Gere is actually not that great an actor, but he is ageing well. He looks as good as ever with a bit of grey and glasses, an improvement even. But sadly I have never seen him be great in anything - although he was good in the mostly unseen Days of Heaven.Here he gives us another of his keep-it-all-inside performances.I had to decide whether to write a spoiler review or a non spoiler review. I normally only like to do non-spoiler reviews unless there is something important that I want to say. Here spoilers are the most important thing.*Spoiler Starts*Here Gere is a killer - a hot blooded killer, rather than a cold blooded killer - but also an intelligent man. He runs a company and knows how the world turns. Panic or no panic, we have to believe that he is - in turns - both clever and a Dumbo. Why would a smart guy wrap a body in a carpet, cover it in tape and take it to the local dump? Doesn't he watch any mob movies? A body either has to be dumped in running water, buried or chopped up. People scavenge dumps all the time and people work there - they are going to ask questions why a carpet is taped like that and misshaped. Stands to reason!Equally why leave incriminating evidence that he knows for certain that his wife is having an affair in his clothes? Why would he want to keep evidence like that? It is like a newspaper, you read it, get the information from it and throw it away. What do you gain by keeping it long after the fact? Or has he forgotten he had it?Not only does he not watch The Sopranos, he also doesn't watch the Discovery Channel either, because he would learn that is impossible to go anywhere without leaving traces of yourself behind: Hair, skin, tissue samples, fingerprints, DNA, you are a walking paper trail. The police scientists would have the technology to realize in five minutes that this was a crime scene and that blood had been cleaned from the floor. Look at any number of real life cases on the Internet if you want to find out more. Sorry readers, if you plan to kill someone and get away with it you better be smarter than anyone on display here. Technology has gone up a notch since La Femme Infidele - of which this is a remake - was made in 1969.(Some reviewers seem to read that the cops where on his trail - using the technology above - but hadn't got around to arresting him. An interest premise that is impossible to discount.)Good acting and even an Oscar nomination for "unfaithful" Diane Lane. Maybe she is better than her track record suggests, but she has been in a awful lot of movies that have passed before my eyes - without making any mental impression on me. Although, to be fair, most were support roles.Her actions rather reminds me of the joke about the Pope giving Catholics permission to have sex on a Sunday "as long as you don't enjoy it." Here you can have adulterous sex as long as you feel bad about it afterwards and go through a lot of self-recriminations. Before returning for a touch of second helpings!*Spoiler Ends*This is a very watchable film and one that I am happy to recommend. It had something to say and a was stylish when saying it. However it occurred to me that films like this wouldn't get made without it having a shock-horror centre. This is a bit sad. I think it would have been just as good without it and just let it explore what adultery does to the insides of possessive people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything that made Claude Chabrol's work a winner in 1968 has vanished in the air.SPOILERS First :Richard Gere is miscast as the lead :he's more handsome than Frenchie bland mediocre Martinez;one should note that in the original,the part of the lover was a small one ,but Maurice Ronet made his one scene count ;Martinez is unable to sustain any interest for his character.But that's not all,far from it:Chabrol began his work with a bourgeois life depiction;here the social background has been totally wiped out ,a vague middle-class couple with vague friends .But what made Chabrol's film memorable was his cinematographic language:never ,never,Michel Bouquet and Stephane Audran spoke about the tragedy afterward:only their looks allowed the audience to know about their "communication" .In Chabrol's film,Bouquet does not seem to enjoy sex that much and one scene in bed shows Audran's frustration;such is not the case here,cause Gere seems to be a "true" husband (see the scenes in the bedroom and in the bath tub):so Lane's behavior does not make much sense. A lot of scenes were directly taken from "la femme infid?le :Gere and the private detective down by the sea ( Bouquet met his man on the banks of the Seine), the car crash, the murder (the scenes are very similar).A lack of tempo does not help either;Chabrol 's movie only lasted about 95 min,and it seems that there's a lot of filler in Lyne 's one: naturally ,he feels his quota of nudities which were totally absent in the French movie:and however ,Audran displayed much more sensuality than Mrs Lambert.A question:when will Lyne make another fantastic movie? We have not forgotten "Jacob's ladder" and I guess we never will.I will have forgotten "unfaithful" within one month... or even less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**WARNING - SPOILER******I had heard so many bad things about this movie that I had decided not to see it, but changed my mind after all the Oscar buzz about Diane Lane's performance - what a mistake that was. How stupid is this movie? Let's count the ways. First she runs into some guy who invites her up to his apartment which looks like a frat boys library (I guess that was supposed to be soho chic - whatever.) Then he makes some weird comments to her and she rushes off - but wait! She finds a schoolgirl reason to call him and come back over for coffee! Then wham, bam, thank you French man - they're having sex anywhere they can get their pants down. And am I the only one who thought the sex scenes were like amateur porn? I can just hear the director - "o.k. now, grab her breast." And what was with the slapping nonsense? That was a little too close to a rape scene for my comfort level, but let's move on. So they go out in public and there just HAPPENS to be her husband's employee, and she just HAPPENS not to recognize him, even though she's looking right at him? Then she goes to meet him another day and just HAPPENS to run into her suburban friends? Then they go have coffee and the old one just HAPPENS to bring up the fact that she had an affair and it ruined her life? And let's not forget the best one of all - after her *perfect* husband (he helps with the dishes, for Pete's sake) kills the stupid french boy and stuffs him in the trunk, he just HAPPENS to get rear-ended at his son's school? AAAHHH!!! The list goes on and on, but I'm already tired of reliving this silly dribble. But I have to add that the end was by far the biggest cop-out of any movie that I can remember. If this is your idea of a great film, I would kindly suggest you start seeing more movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning, some spoilers in this review...This film was absolutely amazing. I read several of the other user comments, and most of what I'll say is in response to those. One person compared this to a Lifetime movie, and while the story line does seem appropriate, it is entirely unlike anything I've seen on Lifetime. This actually ties in with another comment, that Gere is not pushing her towards infidelity, Lane does it because of all the desires that are expected to be tucked away by American society. In making Gere a complete innocent in the first half, it makes the viewer question his guilt later on. I honestly was thinking that Lane would end up being accused of the murder, and that possibly Gere would allow it to happen as a form of punishment. Also, I think too often the stereotypical "male cheating" is done, and, like Disclosure, this is a refreshing look at similar circumstances from another point of view. Above all, Gere's performance was incredible, as was Lane's, and I have to agree with one other reviewer, the kid was horrid and annoying. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Annoying microphone!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's an okei movie, but the bad filming makes it worse.. there's a microphone hanging above the people talking. Of course this is normal when filming a movie, but the camera-people aren't suppose to film it, and it really shouldn't have passed the editing. This gives the movie an impression of a B-movie.. Otherwise an okei story, but not very original nor unexpected happenings. I rated this movie as a 4, but maybe it didn't even deserve that..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS Went to see this movie to make my wife happy Saturday night. Even she admitted it was horrible. The movie is long and very boring. If its supposed to make you think, I must have brain damage or something. All I could think about was how bored I was. Richard Gere is lame, as always. I did feel bad for 'Dewey', since his parents were such losers.There is really very little going on in this horribly long movie. I'll sum it up**** SPOILER BELOW ****Wife cheats on husband Husband finds out Wife decides to call affair quits Husband kills wife's boyfriend...And then, well, we never know what the hell happens at the end. They leave you hanging. Please, for the love of God, don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depressing and implausible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I just found this a bit depressing - even a happily married couple can completely disintegrate, and both parties show all the morality of a toad. Wife shags fit but superficial French bloke in various slightly disturbing ways for about an hour, hubbie then kills French bloke, packs up the body in his trunk and drives it to the tip, and no one is any the wiser. Film peters out with lots of formulaic guff designed to appeal to middle America. It lacked dramatic tension throughout, the high point was the slightly surreal confrontation between husband and lover. But it was also completely implausible both practically and emotionally - why would a conventional housewife be attracted to intellectual snob, why is she obsessed with sex, how would husband manage to kill lover with snow globe, what would hottie French guy see in her anyway. I also thought it was kind of misogynistic, this woman with no control over her own urges, neglects her child as a result and is basically shown as completely selfish and libidinous. How come the guy in Fatal Attraction just comes across as a nice guy who made a mistake, but in this film the woman is a mistake masquerading as a good wife. The film maker flatters himself that women really care about sex that much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, it goes a little like this: Somewhat happy, but bored middle class white couple raising a fam in the burbs. Wifey meets strange foreign guy and proceeds to do him all over town until hubby finds out. Hubby goes ballistic and kills boyfriend and they walk--no, drive off into the sunset (Mexico I believe). Ok, besides the mute dialogue, that was it. Diane Lane was praised for this? Why is it that women are being praised for doing roles that require them to be emotionless, dirty sluts? Halle, Charlize, Diane, Salma, the list goes on. In order to be taken seriously in Hollywood as a female actor, I have to behave the creative role of "whore". Hmm...big leap on our part ladies. Talk about putting the movement back. Anyways, this film was boring aside from her acting like she's scared to have sex all the time with this guy and does anyway. Who comes up with these movies? Can I sit in on the meeting and just shake my head and wonder, why? Gere is boring and grim in this and you don't even notice him when he's in the scene. The plot was dumb, the acting was mediocre, and just overall idiotic. This is a movie and it's fake, but some realism please. How do they con people into doing these movies? What's the rationalization for this? If I saw the script, I'd think it was a dark comedy. I was laughing my butt off throughout. It's not complex, it's weird and stupid. I feel duped by this film. I'm glad she got her freak on because she was bored with married life and all, but gimme a break. Dumb movies liek this spawn Lifetime remakes like "Infidelity" and other trash to the like. Is this the state of middle-class white marriages? No wonder the divorce rate is high? I hope this was a drop in the bucket and not significant to real life. Highly recommend you avoid this film, unless of course you're into whatever makes this movie bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to believe this movie was only two hours long. It felt like so much more as every possible but improbable plot device is painstakingly delivered so that no one, but no one, can possibly miss them. Each scene is thoroughly telegraphed in the first few seconds, but yet the director makes us watch as the rest of the scene is oh so slowly delivered exactly as expected. The end credit were SO welcome. Some directors can make great use of dramatic pauses to emphasize the most subtle expressions or to build awkward tension. This movie, which seems like at least four movies, is one big continuous but failed attempt at this technique. I feel sorriest for young Mr Sullivan, who is brilliant in "Malcolm", but is given a story that can't decide if he's supposed to be 8 years or 8 months old. Mr. Gere and Ms. Lane should have known better, but knowing how movies are made it's hard to blame them. DO NOT take your special someone to this file. It offers all the romance of, say, "Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf". I could go into more depth, but ugh, enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Diane Lane Shines in Turning of the TiimeTables on the Usual Adultery Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Unfaithful" makes me want to say, for the record, that all those many times I was late picking up my son at school it was because I was caught in traffic. But then I'd never buy a new satin slip and tiger stilettos for any man. While written and directed by men, this does give sweet revenge turn-around for those endless movies of older married men having affairs with much younger women. It's worth the price of admission to have a barely suppressed raging Richard Gere confront the lover with "What are you, 28?"There are legions of Gere fans out there (I've already had a debate with a colleague on this) who are stupefied that Diane Lane would cheat on him and whether Olivier Martinez is more tempting (hell, yes, he is, even though in my 15 years of running a used book sale I never once encountered a used book dealer that looked like him). But I think the case is made quite visually that's she's a fragilized, overprotected, bored trophy in a gigantic mansion with little to do other than pick up after and feed her kid and husband. Lane is also absolutely magnificent and enthralling in conveying a woman caught up in a maelstrom of passion and risk-tempting, especially enhanced by editing that focuses first on foreplay and sensual recall, though the illicit relationship gets murky with unnecessary rough stuff.Those of us who have graduated from the "Law and Order" School of Criminal Justice (and there's many brief appearances in the film by New York actors who have taken courses there) will find some details in the plot that make the final cliffhanger somewhat unconvincing.This film may well serve to get quite a few suburbanites to hurriedly move back to the City to save their marriages and/or encourage the wife get a job.Very nice use of the Ali Farka Toure/Ry Cooder collaboration from "Talking Timbuktu."(originally written 5/19/2002)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film has nothing new to offer - we have seen it all before. The unfaithful wife, the young attractive guy who she is having an affair with and the jealous husband who loses control when he finds out about the affair. Adrian Lyne's moral positions fit well into the second election period of George W. Bush with its apparently strengthened conservative values. If you watch the alternative ending (included in the DVD) it gets even worse. The 'explicit' sex scenes may still shock some audiences in the US (or the Middle East), but definitely not in Europe, so even this questionable appeal is lost.It is difficult to understand how Adrian Lyne could come up with such an interesting movie as 'Jacob's Ladder' while at the same time all his other work is fairly shallow and boring.If you're after an interesting original movie about love and passion, pick any French film from the shelve and you're better off. Don't waste your time and money on this flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't believe this hunk of junk gets so much praise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did I see a different "Unfaithful" from everybody else? I keep reading positive reviews, and I'm absolutely baffled at how many flaws are being conveniently overlooked:1. Ending? What ending? - I'm not supposed to post spoilers, and I won't. In truth, I can't spoil anything, because I can't think of one relevant thing that happened during the last 30 minutes. It was as if they ran out of money, and simply spliced together what footage they had to try to produce a conclusion.2. Yes, Diane Lane was good, but her character, Connie, is really, really dumb. She makes no attempt whatsoever to cover her affair, she allows herself to be seen in public, her lies are utterly transparent, and, amazingly, she frequently tells lies when the truth would work. (Example: Why lie about how she met the other guy? That, at least, was completely innocent.)Yes, it's certainly a legitimate portrayal, but why not make Connie a little bit more clever? Who knows, she might actually have come across as complex or interesting.3. Nobody else is significantly smarter. I can't mention exactly why without resorting to spoilers...4. There's a lot of Art-for-Art's-Sake. Do we really need all of those camera angles, closeups, etc. during the windstorm scene? Do we really need to see an overhead view of a commuter train which slowly fades to... the exact same view of a commuter train? Do we really need all of those slow-motion flashbacks? Do we really need to see Connie and Ed's son urinating with the bathroom door open? I could go on, but I only have 1000 words.5. Let me get this straight; Connie has repeated, unprotected sex with an anonymous stranger, who himself is a notorious player, and she doesn't end up with a disease or a pregnancy? I'm not trying to impose morality (It IS just a movie after all.) but those are legitimate concerns these days. Besides, an STD or a pregnancy would have jump-started the plot a little.I don't want to be completely negative. The cast was certainly good. They delivered their lines, they hit their marks, etc. The production was also very good; the camera crews and editors, especially, deserve thumbs up just for being able to pull off that windstorm scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie revolves around an issue which is one of the major reason of many divorces happening these days. The movie enlightens those petty things that makes man and woman drift apart after marriage. And it also brings in notice how deep a woman's heart is, how much care and love it needs and how it could suppress it's need and feelings for the love of her family. Amazing acting by Diane Lane; the sensuality, the urge for love, for not being able to restrain yourself from doing something as it fulfills your desires, all what her role demanded, she gave it to the full. Overall, she depicted a woman who is in need of love, who has her desires unfulfilled and is in a dilemma of choosing between her family and her desires. But unfortunately, it was only her who kept the movie going otherwise the movie had nothing much special in it.My movie ratings are on following basis each having 2 stars:1. Plot: .5/2 The starting was good but after a while it was quite lost. The movie could have been given a different route and surely a different ending. The issue they took on; gave to it a very unrealistic end. They could have shown much more.2. Cast&amp;Crew: 2/2 All were at their best. Hats off to Diane Lane. And after seeing Olivier Martinez, one thing I came to know about is ladies love guys speaking English with a French accent hehe... 3. Imagination: 1.5/2 as I said, the petty things that breaks up a marriage and the unspoken desires of a woman very well thought. Half a star deducted for not thinking about a better story.4. Cinematography: 1.5/2 one thing I really liked is that the movie is all shot out in a cloudy and rainy atmosphere which perfectly goes with the story and also the music. But because of a poor plot, cinematographer's work could not get much of attention. 5.How much it satisfied its genre: 1.5/2 romance-full, drama-yes as the movie if full of feelings like desires, lust, love and revenge. There was not really any thriller in there. So overall rating- 7THANKS</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I was quite surprised to see the cinema so full for this movie, even on opening weekend. I guess not that many movies for women in their 30's plus exist these days!I expected this movie, as I'm sure many people did, to be a Fatal Attraction but with the genders switched around.I was pleasantly surprised and shocked by it NOT being what I expected, and I definitely enjoyed it a lot more than Fatal Attraction.The summary of this movie is that Diane Lane's character starts cheating on her husband (Richard Gere) with a beautiful French man(Olivier Martinez). Everything else should be left for surprise.The pacing of this movie is perfect. We got a sense of Connie and Edward's home life before she met the dashing Paul. They have a darling son, Charlie, who adds a lot of humour to the movie, but in a non precocious way. After the affair starts we see Connie's feelings range from excitement to complete disgust with herself. And of course Edward inevitably finds out. His reaction is interesting, to say the least, and perhaps very honest.The acting is great, especially from Diane Lane. The sex scenes are pretty raunchy, and made me uncomfortable at certain points, but it's interesting to see how different sex with the lover and sex with the husband were.At the end of this movie I didn't feel cheated or robbed with some contrived ending (although others may argue differently). This film dealt with how being in an affair must feel, and how finding out you're being cheated on could make your react in uncharacteristic ways.As a movie critic said, this movie will indeed make you never have an affair!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly deep and impeccably acted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1987, Adrian Lyne brought us Fatal Attraction, an sensually charged cautionary tale to any man thinking of flirting with disaster in the form of the attractive blonde he meets by chance. He practically invented the modern erotic thriller with that work of genius and fifteen years later he released Unfaithful, yet another domestic story of a married adult straying, except this time it's the woman who ends up in the bed of an attractive stranger.Since Attraction there have been a myriad of attempts to recapture the combination of thrills, suspense and eroticism that Lyne was able to achieve but, with the rare exception, they failed to bring out the urgency and seriousness of his tone and instead fell into a parody of sorts. We began slowly but after a while it just became the same situation recycled over and over again; the loveless marriage, the bastard husband or nagging wife, the obsessive spouse -- it got to a point where when you see a poster like the one for this film, with star Diane Lane sprawled over her lover's bare chest while Richard Gere looms above her, you already know what you are going to be getting.Unfaithful once again proves that this is the genre where Lyne thrives because he breaks down a lot of the traditional moves that have become standard. The marriage between Lane and Gere isn't stale or aggressive; they are in a healthy and loving marriage. Her new sexual companion, played by Olivier Martinez, doesn't demand that she leave her husband or insist on stalking her about, he's actually a little suspiciously casual about their romance. This is a film that becomes more about the things that it doesn't say than what it does. What compels this seemingly content woman to jump into the bed of another man? What knowledge of her activities is her husband hiding under his stoic gaze? These questions are helped with tremendous skill by it's two lead actors, Lane and Gere both delivering a quality of work that I honestly had no idea they were capable of. Lane operates on so many levels here, from slinky eroticism to household mother to guilt-ridden betrayer and she sinks into this role so thoroughly that there is never a moment where she feels as though she's phoning it in. Gere gives a work of wildly internal talent, equal parts vulnerable, mysterious, intimidating and wounded. There's a confrontation scene with him where he goes through about ten different extremes in a five minute time frame and it honestly blew me away how well he pulled it off. He is devastating here.Unfaithful builds the suspense wonderfully until a shattering climax a little over the halfway mark that takes the whole thing into a new and remarkable territory. Here it becomes more than just an intriguing look into the modern marriage and a dissection of both sides of infidelity. In it's second half it turns into a complex study of human behavior, digging deep into themes of guilt and violence. The erotic scenes are very charged, as expected from Lyne, but it's the softer ones that end up leaving the strongest impression, down to the absolutely incredible final shot that is going to stick with me for a while. It's one of those shots that fully captures everything a film is trying to say, without beating you over the head with it as if you're too stupid to understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murderous affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another highly stylised and implausible thriller from Adrian Lyne. Like "Fatal Attraction", we're presented with another triangle, this time two men to one woman. Lyne is given ample opportunity to indulge his flair, if that's the right word, for graphic sex scenes, but of course, death takes a hand before the end and suddenly the triangle is lopsided.The film is beautifully shot in the New York autumn and is accompanied by an eclectic but atmospheric soundtrack. The acting too is good especially Diane Lane (and her body double) as the feckless housewife who trips, stumbles and falls, quite literally into the great passion of her life. Richard Gere supports well as the cuckolded husband, a turnabout from the days when he was young enough to play the gigolo type who seduces his wife. Albert Martinez completes the threesome as the charismatic young rake, with a different woman for each day of the week before his misdemeanours catch him up in the end.Given all of the above, the film still ultimately failed to really grab or move me. These are impossibly beautiful people in unlikely situations for whom I couldn't care whether they lived or died. Coincidence looms large in the scheme of things. Some of the leads' actions too are questionable too - would Gere's character really race to attend his son's Thankgiving play without dumping a dead body out of his car boot while Lyne somehow manages to contrive an almost happy ending out of the situation, which has to b ring too.As a movie, it's all surface and no depth, flashy but unengaging. You'll watch it and not feel a thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You've heard of romantic-comedy? This is romantic-horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder how many people understand that Unfaithful is a horror movie. Not in the sense of a maniac with an axe and buckets of blood spewing everywhere, but in that it portrays the slow, inexorable and unexplained destruction of a family's happiness.Constance and Edward Sumner (Diane Lane and Richard Gere) should be a happily married couple. They're rich enough to own a huge house by a lake. They have a circle of interesting friends. They have a darling young son. They have a cute dog. They're both incredibly attractive and still appear to be attracted to each other. But one day, while Connie's running errands in the city during a wind storm, she meets a handsome book dealer named Paul Martel (Oliver Martinez). He's young and charmingly European and Connie finds herself drawn to him. They begin a torrid affair with Paul consuming more and more of Connie's thoughts and time. Eventually, Edward becomes suspicious and asks a private eye to follow his wife. He sees photos and Connie and Paul together and confronts Paul about the affair. What happens then changes Connie and Edward's lives forever.This is a very engrossing story, but it's not exactly light and frothy entertainment. This isn't a thriller where suspense is generated through some twisted little game between characters. The tension this film doesn't come from artifices of plot but from watching the pain of desperate people trapping themselves in terrible situations. There are no moments of melodrama in Unfaithful, no easy rationales or easier resolutions. This is very much a movie for adults to appreciate on an adult level?and that's not a reference to Diane Lane getting naked.Though she is unclothed and terrifically sexy in this film, Lane's performance is so powerful and real that her nudity isn't titillating or exploitive but simply a match to the raw emotions overwhelming Constance Sumner. In her first sexual encounter with Paul, Connie's body literally shakes in equal parts anticipation and apprehension. The pain and the fear she feels when the affair threatens her family almost visibly radiates off her face.Richard Gere matches Lane's work, but in a different way. Edward is a man disconnected from his deeper emotions. He only swims on the surface of himself and when something comes up from deep within, he can't control it. If Lane's Constance is like a quivering exposed nerve, Edward is a rumbling volcano that erupts uncontrollably.For his part, Oliver Martinez isn't a third wheel in this adulterous triangle. His Paul may be a cad, yet he's not bad. Paul is a thoughtless hedonist, but he doesn't want to cause anyone harm. He just never allows himself to dwell on the collateral damage of his romantic and sexual behavior. Martinez may look like one of those Euro-heartthrobs who pop up in Hollywood every few years and get drooled over by all women before disappearing again, but he shows a lot of acting talent and skill here.The reason why I call Unfaithful a horror movie is because it embraces the defining theme of the genre - it is about the normal world being assaulted and destroyed by The Other. In this case, though, The Other isn't Paul Martel. He's actually part of the normal world. The Other in this horror movie is the unthinking, uncontrollable desire that seethes through Connie Sumner. Some people may watch this film and think it's about a woman dealing with a neglectful husband and an unfulfilling life. But Edward isn't neglectful and while her life may be a bit more domestic than romantic, Connie isn't some Madame Bovary trapped in an empty existence. As I mentioned earlier, Connie should be happy with her life. She even seems happy with it, but she's still caught up by this unreasoning, unexplained impulse to betray her husband and imperil her family. The fear and anxiety of watching Connie and Edward's life inescapably implode comes from thinking that it can happen to any family at any time.Unfaithful is a romantic-horror movie. It's a pretty small genre, but even if this is the only one ever made, these filmmakers have made a worthwhile contribution to the world of cinema.</fullReview>

The movie had me mesmerized, and the first sign of awesomeness is a scene where Diane Lane remembers the first sexual encounter with her lover while sitting in a train and she goes through an incredible array of emotions in under 2 minutes, everything culminating with her going to the train lavatory, throwing her underwear and washing her crotch in the sink like some drug dealer getting rid of the evidence...well, let's just say I was really impressed by the whole scene, the dept and the subtlety.The movie really doesn't miss at all, scene after scene of great human observation and filmmaking. I won't go in any details because the movie speaks for itself.For me, this movie also had an extra juiciness to it, the fact that all characters are presented incredibly faulty and weak, even the lover's character, who was so sure of himself ends up stupidly dumped in garbage, the husband who was so much in control of his life but ends up cheated upon and doing dumb things and the wife who behaves erratically and ends up being responsible for the whole mess. All characters also do noble things, which have a certain flavor because of their faults, it feels REAL. The script feels REAL. I laughed my ass off reading some comments here complaining about how the characters motivations weren't clear or real enough. Maybe you didn't get a better look around you or you don't want to contemplate how weird people really are in their actions. But for me it's an indication that this movie bothered a lot of people because it is frank and uncompromising. A great great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Consequences of Adultery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lose that light-saber! Hang up those skin-tight super-hero drawers!Audiences over the age of 30 that prefer morality tales rich in irony, ambiguity, and suspense rather than those hare-brained heroics in a galaxy far away, will embrace director Adrian Lyne's provocative soaper "Unfaithful" with Diane Lane, Richard Gere, and Olivier Martinez. This artsy, atmospheric, European-style soap opera focuses on the fatal consequences of infidelity. Essentially, "Unfaithful" qualifies as an above-average remake of French film director Claude Chabrol's 1969 classic "Le Femme Infidele," itself an updated version of Flaubert's vintage novel "Madame Bovary.""Unfaithful" follows the turn of events that occur when a happily married wife wanders and her cuckolded husband begins to wonder about her. Although it contains more subtlety than most of Lyne's earlier efforts, namely "Lolita" (1997), "Indecent Proposal" (1987) and "9&amp;1/2 Weeks" (1986),"Unfaithful" breaks just about as many of the Ten Commandments. What sets Lyne's cautionary fable apart is its bittersweet finale, and the uncertainty that surrounds the conflicted couple. In a cinematic age hopelessly dominated by fantastic computer-generated digital special effects, "Unfaithful" consciously eschews special effects for unadorned realism as much as its attractive heroine, 37-year old Diane Lane, shuns cosmetics because she simply doesn't need them. Moreover, the unusual casting of Richard Gere of "American Gigolo" as the husband and Diane Lane of "Streets of Fire" as the promiscuous wife adds to the off-beat quality of "Unfaithful." Director Adrian Lyne and his scenarists?Alvin Sargent of "Spider-man 2" &amp; William Broyles Jr., of "Castaway"?have cooked up a steamy, sordid saga that qualifies as the best of its kind since Alan J. Pakula's "Presumed Innocent" with Harrison Ford. In "Unfaithful," Connie (Diane Lane) and Edward Sumner (Richard Gere) have shared eleven years of marital bliss. They are raising their 9-year old son Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan of TV's "Malcolm in the Middle") in a comfortable house by the lake in the suburbs of New York. Edward runs his own business, a Wells Fargo-style armored truck outfit. The Sumners have everything that they need and want for nothing. Connie heads into New York City as the plot unfolds to shop for Charlie's birthday. Fighting a fugitive gale-force wind that sweeps through town, Connie collides accidentally with 28-year old, rare book dealer Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez of "Horseman on the Roof") and literally falls on top of this Calvin Klein hunk.Martel invites her up into his fashionable Soho apartment to patch up her scraped knees and drink tea. Later, Connie tells Edward about her brief encounter, and he suggests that she send Martel a bottle of 'cheap' wine for behaving like a Good Samaritan. Unfortunately, things grow complicated, because Connie listens to her hormones instead of her head. Not long afterward, she arouses Edward's suspicions, and he hires a private eye. The photos of Connie's infidelity floor poor Edward.Make no mistake, "Unfaithful" condemns adultery. What happens when Edward and Paul confront each other is as unpredictable as this film is absorbing to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boom Microphones galore!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I love this film. It's powerful, full of good performances, excellent music, and an emotionally wrenching story. I'm not overwhelmed by the direction of the 3rd act, and the finale, but it's still well worthwhile. My biggest problem with it, however, is the simply AMAZING number of times the Boom Microphone gets into the shot. I've worked as a boom operator a couple times, and as a member of the sound department on a number of television movies, and that is a mistake that rarely happens. The strangest thing is that when a boom microphone does happen to dip to close to the action, encroaching on the frame, the camera operator inevitably calls it out, and the take is cut. I can understand, during certain emotional and sexual scenes, the entrance of a boom mic might not have been enough to warrant stopping of the action (the stairwell scene...and you know the one I mean...comes to mind). But for simple dialog scenes? I mean, the boom mic comes into frame on every other scene in this film. It is so frequent, that IMDb doesn't list each incident. I merely says it happens a lot.What happened here? Was it not caught during day-lies? Did no one tell the boom man, "Hey, back it off a foot or so. You keep hitting the actors in the heads." Did the cameraman see it enter frame and just keep it to himself? And finally, did the boom man just keep getting tired of holding it up there? I'm confused.</fullReview>

I know that not all women are like her, but I also know that there are many who feel what she apparently was feeling. My mom even said she enjoyed the movie :S. I think I might need to have a little talk with her and she what exactly she is thinking about!!!lol. The only reason why I really gave this movie a 5 outta 10 was because it creates EXTREME amount of suspense!!! You sit there just waiting to see if they (him or her or both)are going to get caught. Every change in scene builds you up that much more. I was even almost cheering for him to get away with it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good film depicting how complex relationships can be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great acting with a fine cast of actors (especially Diane Lane who is brilliant in this movie and carries it home). Believable plot that overall tells us that affairs have happened, do happen and will always happen in the future; and that, not necessarily does anything have to be wrong in a marriage for one partner to cheat on the other. Thus, the theme of human curiosity, human weakness and human irrationality comes into play.Adrian Lynne really knows how to fuse a plethora of emotions, ranging from frustration to desire and obsession in his films and in his sex scenes as 'Unfaithful' shows when Connie and Olivier first try to make love. Nice to see that Lynne has made a very good erotic drama that also explores the consequences that humans have to live with as a result of them pursuing self-enlightened choices.I, myself, am thinking of purchasing this one on DVD.Give it a watch. My Score = 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An often told story with good depth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Diane Lane and Richard Gere give good performances in this movie. The story is not new, but the approach by the actors and writers brings depth. There is no clear bad guy. The lover played by Oliver Martinez even escapes the normal evil other man thoughts. I was surprised to see him killed. I liked him a little. Diane Lane comes across as a vibrant woman who rediscovers or possibly discovers a strong sexual impulse in herself. The first sex scene and subsequent train ride display the breaking of her rules and the glee received by it. The look on Diane Lane's face in the last sex scene in the hallway as she begs Oliver to f**k her reveals the helplessness she has fallen to. Richard Gere finally showed me why he is famous in 2002. He starred in Chicago and Unfaithful, succeeding in both to show a talent in him that I had never seen before. His wronged husband in Unfaithful shows why the quiet ones should never be underestimated. The scene where he reveals to Diane Lane that he wanted to kill her instead of her lover shocked me. This is a couple that others in the movie aspire to be more like. The two leads drive this movie in the right direction with the help of Adrian Lyne. He bounces back from the creepy, hollow Lolita with a keeper. A good movie to pair up with Adrian Lyne's Fatal Attraction (1987) to compare the two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That Diane Lane received an Oscar Nomination for this film means that the Academy is still not all out at the ranch. She has always been a superb actress, and persistence and quality eventually catch the attention of even those who live lives so dissimilar to the theme.There really were no weak links in this film. It is not an epic, a polemic, nor a ground breaker. It just does what so many films about "infidelity" tried to to do, really well.No flaws. No glorification. No ideology.Great raw cinema about how great 'normal' life can be, and how much angst can be wrought by crossing the rational and emotional barriers of balance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lyne rocks! Lane sizzles! Music is Superb! Richard Gere does nothing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nail bitingly tense film has Lane leading a happy home and a happy sex life in an average day of the world. On a chance encounter, she meets a youngFrench kid(played nonchalant but well by Martinez) and has a steamy affair with him. Soon, she begins to forget what she is doing, and her husband seems toremember. The tension then becomes thick as husband and wife are drawn toand away from each other in a film only Adriane Lyne could direct so well. Diane Lane is awesome as she delivers a role that contains both a bad girl image and a good girl style. As she comes to terms with her desire walking onto an affair, her family life falls to pieces, as she forgets about her sons needs and all. Aside from the brilliant acting(minus boring Gere) it is the MUSIC of the film that brings everything full circle. Jan A.P. Kaczmarek is a genius. He who created the bone chilling score to the flop "Lost Souls" has made a name for himself releasing self composed classical music albums and this score will have the nervous systemon edge whenever it is listened to. Lyne's direction is a lot like that of "Fatal Attraction" but the twist of the sexes makes a lot to keep this from being a copy or clone of that film. All in all, the film is terrific and blends mixed emotions with silence feeling. Hopefully more films made and written as well as this will exist, as films these days are ceasing to please any.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important, but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree that the performances of all the actors was fascinatingly superior, but at the end I was left with some serious questions. The writer and director seemed to overlook the fact that the ENTIRE responsibility for the tragic ending was the fault of the wife. Paul Martel (the young lover) was never to blame -- he was obviously 10 or so years younger than the wife -- and he was COMPLETELY FREE to indulge in one or two or three affairs because he was separated from his wife (we are told he was married in a very sly manner). All responsibility for Paul's death lies with the unfaithful wife -- she was bored with her suburban home, bored with her life with her husband and child, and she embarked on an obsessive affair through her own volition. However, the film never seems to emphasize her responsibility, her outrageous guilt -- she is NOT a heroine, free to continue her life as before, but her actions brought about the death of a beautiful man. This is NOT made clear at the end. The ending (parked in front of a Police Station) hints (barely) at possible retribution, but this was weakly done. The general feeling seemed to be "well, the husband and the wife escaped punishment and all would be well!" This should NOT have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened to the Latrell Sprewell jersey?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That is exactly the question this interesting little film explores. Diane Lane plays a supposedly happy housewife of many years to good businessman husband Richard Gere. He is a good husband always good to his wife, and a wonderful all around man. His wife on a very windy day goes shopping for her son's birthday. She bumps into a handsome young Frenchman who courts her despite the fact he knows she is married. What ensues is an incredible psychological drama, of these two very good performances wandering, asking, dodging each other, and neither one really sure of themselves anymore. I cannot review too much of the movie without giving it away, but I made a mistake in looking at this movie. I thought it would be another Richard Gere typical silly love story I had no desire to watch. But this movie is more than just another smutty Richard Gere film. This is a very good movie that is very well acted. There is only some minor violence, and by no stretch is this an action movie.There are some other interesting aspects of this movie discussed, a clash of cultures so to speak. Suburbia vs. urban life is explored, people pretending to be happy vs. people being happy. Would Latrell Sprewell stay with the New York Knicks? (this movie did not explore that issue at all, but right now if I were that little kid I'd be pretty mad, by the way GO CELTICS!!!) I think the overall theme of this movie is happiness.And what I mean by happiness is exactly what will people do to be happy? What are people willing to do, are people really happy, do they pretend to be happy? In the end that is the question that Diane Lane's character must grapple with. But the ending is incredible without being a real shocker. The movie just kind of fades away, you have a general idea of what will happen, but you don't know for sure. Overall this is a movie you will not expect. This is completely opposite of what you might expect of a movie like this, but this is an enjoyable and somewhat cerebral movie and I like it a lot. When you watch this movie watch for the little things, look for the nicely subtle cinematography, the pauses in dialogue that say a million words, the little things are what make this movie so good and so different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of what can be said about this movie has already been posted. It is another fantastic performance by Diane Lane, equal to or better than her performance in "A Walk On The Moon'" In "Unfaithful" she plays the role of a house wife and mother who betrays her family by entring into an affair with a man she meets on a trip into town. The affair is discovered by her husband and the plot thickes ofter that. My favorite part of the movie is when she finds the pictures of herself and her lover in the pocket of her husbands jacket.I purchased the DVD and the thing that most surprised me was the alternate ending It was the only place in the entire movie where the adulteress said she was sorry for all the death and misery she had caused, and it was deleted from the movie. That strikes me as strange.</fullReview>

From her early roles in "THE OUTSIDERS", "RUMBLE FISH" and "STREETS OF FIRE" to more recent films like "THE PERFECT STORM" and "UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN" she always displays a natural beauty and warmth but she can also play such varied characters. In "UNFAITHFUL" DIANE LANE really comes into her own. It is an amazing performance that won her tons of acclaim, awards AND an Oscar and Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. DIANE LANE's performance as a woman who has an adulterous affair that wrecks the lives of everyone she cares about is an absolute powerhouse star turn, and she is nicely supported by RICHARD GERE. The film itself is very well made with lots of subtlety and style. An allround great movie that is made unforgettable by DIANE LANE's Oscar nominated performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Spoilers ahead). Lane (Oscar nomination), Gere, and Martinez put on a tour-de-force of acting that propels this erotic thriller to greater and greater heights of tension (sexual and otherwise) until it's almost unbearable.Lane, in particular, communicates the full range of emotions, from passion to joy to fear to guilt, without dialog, doing it all with her facial expressions and her body language. A superior performance. The way the snow-globe was used as a prop is a good example of some terrific writing.I know some thought the ambiguous ending was something of a cop out, but I thought it was perfect (I'm betting that they pull into the police station and turn themselves in).

		<shortDescription>Interesting but cliched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible SPOILERS:I watched this movie because of all the hype about Diane Lane's performance. Her performance was indeed excellent but the movie itself was cliched in many obvious ways as well as having plot holes that one of Richard Gere's character's Hummers could be driven through. One annoying thing... where did the private eye purchase the black and white film? I realize from film class that the black and white pictures help the people stand out from the background which worked cinematically but it was jarring to see anyone in 2002 hand someone B&amp;W pictures. Perhaps Richard Gere should have paid the fellow some more so that he could have afforded color film.As many have already pointed out, Diane Lane's character had no motivation whatsoever for her affair. She even says in the movie that she is obsessed with the young kid she is banging every chance she gets. Her husband was attentive and a good father and aside from the constant rumors about gerbils, had nothing really wrong with him.The signs of her cheating were classic and classically cliche (new clothes, new coldness to her husband's touch, etc...) Several technical things seemed out of place... the big cell phones, the big camcorder, etc...The most unbelievable part of the movie was that the kid she was banging answered the door for Richard Gere. When you live in a security building, you don't answer a knock at the door. Then to let the guy in and try to chat with him. You're banging his wife!! At the very least (since he is old), he's gonna have a gun. If he wants answers, have him leave his e-mail address!Diane Lane of course did look awesome for her age and it was brave of her to do the sex scene in the hallway.I noticed a lot of people said that they were in front of a Police station at the end. I didn't notice. I did like that they got away with murder. It is unusual for a movie to have that happen.All in all, I'd give it a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

Wait, far fetched story, ridiculous plot tools- that's what's wrong with this film! The film has style, and is filmed well. However, the main plot device that the film uses to create all the tension and 'danger' that the movie focuses on, besides adultery, is truly bone-headed. See the message boards for my comments about the dreaded SNOW GLOBE. The film unravels with how it deals with this, and can no longer be taken seriously as a 'what-if this happened to me in real life' type of film. Any viewer that is not troubled by the questions raised by the SNOW GLOBE should really think about what they expect in a movie like this. With a little more work and thought, the film could have been very good, but instead, it left me feeling that the Diane Lane character must have had a closed-head injury or glue-sniffing past to make her so STUPID!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thunderous pot boiler has bored housewife/mother Diane Lane (in a hot and deceptively strong Oscar-nominated performance) falling under the spell of Frenchman Olivier Martinez and having a wild and lustful sexual affair that will make your heart race and your pulse pound. Lane, married to Richard Gere, just becomes an addict to Martinez's advances and creative thoughts and soon it becomes apparent that her affair is going to be found out. Gere, not near as dumb or naive as Lane would hope, proves to be a smart cookie. However his intelligence and knowledge may lead to even more explosive action than Lane and Martinez's trumped-up sexual interludes. Director Adrian Lyne (best known for "Fatal Attraction") is able to bring the movie to a fevered pitch at about the 90-minute mark, but soon the thrill slowly dies away and we are left with a strange resolution and a somewhat odd way of getting there. Lane is just so good in this production. She has had a career mired by films that just were not very impressive (usually no fault of her own on the screen), but she was finally able to hit a real winner here. The two men each impress as well, but she is the glue and fire the movie had to have. The love scenes are lustful, erotic and are much like lit powder kegs that are about to explode on the screen. Not as intelligent as it would have liked, but still good enough for those of a mature age (trust me on that one). Even with some shortcomings, I bet you won't fall asleep on this one. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>UNFAITHFUL brings to mind the old expression, "I only have two speeds; if you don't like the FIRST one, you sure ain't gonna like the second." The first 90 minutes of UNFAITHFUL unfold at the first speed. The last 30+ minutes unfold at the second.How director Adrian Lynne managed to assemble this many fine performances (Richard Gere, Diane Lane, Olivier Martinez, Erik Per Sullivan, Margaret Colin and Kate Burton), and enough nudity and hot sex for the SPICE channel and STILL manage to make a dull movie is beyond me. Certainly the script peters out after 90 minutes, but that doesn't fully explain the overall slack pacing.One piece of advice to the writers: Diane Lane has great tits and legs, but she's also looks a little frazzled. Don't have an older, prettier, more glamourous and YOUNGER LOOKING actress as is Margaret Colin tell Lane how great she looks. UNFAITHFUL is a 6 for the acting (and, maybe the sex) only. If you want a BETTER movie about the horrific consequences of adultery, see the underrated little gem, "Random Hearts".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was an ill wind that knocked over the bicycle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Unfaithful" begins with static shots of the Sumner's nice suburban home, and about 1:20 into the first scene we see the wind knock over their son's bicycle. This is, metaphorically, what the whole film is about. As the title suggests, it is a story about infidelity and guilt, observing the human condition when things, thought impossible only moments before, go in unpredicted directions. In a theme explored in different ways in films such as "Sliding Doors" and "Run, Lola, Run", this movie's story is set up by a missed connection, the failure to flag down a NYC taxi on a very windy day. Had a cab stopped, it would simply have been "thank you", and everything subsequent would have been 'normal' for Connie and Edward. Diane Lane as Constance and Richard Gere as her husband, Edward, are at the top of their form here. The film editing is very interesting, during key scenes cutting between what Constance and Edward are doing at the very same time, in very different circumstances. A very fine movie which examines the real concept that most of us have triggers that can turn us to a dark side.SPOILERS follow, please read no further.As the DVD extras comment, Constance had no "reason" to enter into an affair with the young stranger, the French used book dealer. She loved her husband, who in all appearances was ideal, and they had a young son and a very nice home. Connie was involved in normal activities that a wife and mom would be, and she was not unhappy. The wind blowing over the bicycle is what happened to her. A chance meeting, the wind blowing them into a collision, her bleeding knee, no taxi would stop, he invited her in, she was uncomfortable, planned to leave, he offered her a book, quoted a meaningful passage, they exchanged names and phone numbers, back home she thought about him, he represented excitement, passion, they had erotic intercourse, it became a sexual addiction of sorts for her. Her brain told her it was wrong, she should stop, her weakness for the addiction made her keep going back. In the process Edward realized she was not herself, she made excuses to not meet for lunch, she lied about certain things, he had her followed, photos showed what was going on.The irony is set up when Edward goes to the young man's home, introduces himself, they each pour a drink, it has all the appearances to the Frenchman of a congenial discussion of a woman they both admired, but Edward found the snow-globe he had bought for Connie, sat on the bed they had used, became disoriented, sick, and in a fit of rage hit him over the head with the globe, twice, bleeding he died, as the phone rang, it was Connie explaining how she could not go on, it was wrong, she loved her husband, she would go visit him no more. Body wrapped in a rug, floor scrubbed, body dumped, joined Connie at school play, she was releived to be back as 'herself', but now he had the guilt. Cops showed up at home, had found her name/number in his home, reported missing, later Connie saw the snow-globe back in her collection, looked at Edward, knew what happened. The body was found, Connie and Edward were suspected, it was only a matter of time before the cops made appropriate connections and gathered evidence, late night in the car they spoke of running away abroad, starting a new life, as the light goes from red, to green, to red ... right in front of the police station. Thus the ambiguous ending, did he or didn't he turn himself in? Doesn't matter, that isn't what the movie was about. It was about how an ill wind can blow things our way, we have to make decisions, decisions have consequences. Or, as director Lyne explains, a study of "the body language of guilt and suspicion." The DVD extras are particularly interesting, conversations with the director and the three main actors, the film editor, an other "making of" topics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood Hack Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to see the difference between masterful, inspired film making and standard Hollywood`hack work, see Claude Chabrol's 1969 masterpiece, "La Femme Infidele," the film upon which "Unfaithful" is based, and compare it with this film. Chabrol's film is a masterpiece of economy of statement. It begins with the affair already established and under way. The wife and her lover are never seen together. The viewer's intelligence is never insulted. Nothing has to be spelled out. All of this is in stark contrast to "Unfaithful." Here we have to be shown how the wife and lover meet and then the excruciatingly boring series of seduction scenes until they are in the sack together. Then, lest we miss the point that they feel passion toward one another, we have to watch a number of ridiculous scenes, probably inspired by "Post Coitum," in which the lovers have passionate sex in a sereis of unlikely places, such as a restaurant toilet, a seat in a movie theater during an afternoon screening, and in an apartment hallway in the middle of the afternoon. All of this might be a bit comical if the movie were so boring, which it is right up until the scene--I'll try not to give anything away--where the husband visits the lover's apartment. Only then does the film pick up a little steam.The film does have a few redeeming features. As other reviewers have pointed out, Diane Lane gives a remarkable performance. So, surprisingly, does Richard Gere. In fact, this may be the first time I have seen the usually phlegmatic Gere do something that might be called acting. But that's about all that can be said for this film. Do yourself a favor and rent "La Femme Infidele" instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A woman's fantasy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Ware spoilers ahead!*This movie was a woman's fantasy, positively and negatively. On the one hand, the wife (Diane Lane) had the attention of the younger stud, giving it to her romantically and physically; and on the other hand she had the handsome and charming (downplayed) Gere as her husband. Similar to "Fatal Attraction", where Michael Douglas' wife at home happened to be the perfect Anne Archer, you have to ask "Why is the cheating spouse screwing up such a good thing?" Sure, Frenchy was an annoying little punk from a man's point of view, but his own "sensitive guy" charm was still obvious. Of course, when Gere killed him in a state of instability, he became a co-participant in the guilt of his wife - and, in the same scene, Gere just happened to overhear wife tearfully breaking it off - the perfect female fantasy!Of course, the perfect negative (and positive) aspect to the fantasy, was the wife's discovery of the sensitive "To my beautiful wife..." message in the glass paperweight that her husband had given to her, and she had in turn, given to Frenchy. Oh! The poignancy! I guess her husband was romantic after all!Death and body disposal at the dump seemed a little severe for Frenchy, but the message seemed to be "It can be dangerous to get involved with married people" - and that is certainly a true sentiment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worthy of such praise...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lauded throughout the reviews here, I'm shocked at the reception this has received.Possible Spoilers ahead...How possibly, can this have such a faithful following and such praise with so many glaring flaws? Was it the steamy sex scenes between an extremely hot Diane Lane and her "French" heart-throb? As a female reviewer noted, first Viggo Mortensen, now some other sex-god (she asked what gal wouldn't cheat!?). Did these and the romantic ambiance simply take viewers so far away from reality? I think not, but what do I know?I like Gere and Lane, but certain aspects of the plausibility gap were grossly run down with the direction within this film. Sure I told myself that "that could happen" if one were totally freaked and unable to handle the situation. For example when Gere accidentally murders hot loverboy and then rolls him up in a carpet and takes the body to his car trunk in broad daylight--no reason to be suspicious here, not even for the guy who offers to help him put this bulky rug into the trunk when he struggles. Naw, wouldn't raise any suspicions or result in someone jotting down a license number...maybe I'm just paranoid.Or how about a couple of cops who can bring up a month old parking ticket from outside Lane's lover's apartment, though "no, don't really know the man..." yet not even check telephone records to substantiate a more viable tie between the two? She only used a payphone once. The rest of the time she was calling from home with her husband and child right there. Puh-leeze!This work had all the talent, all the possibility of being a great flick in addition to being sexy and thrilling, but this viewer found it so flawed, I was unable to really suspend my disbelief after halfway though the mess that it really is. The ending was so up in the air, I couldn't begin to call it ambiguous as another viewer noted in review, because the only explanation was that perhaps they ran out of film and script!Sure you can leave questions unanswered and unresolved and leave the audience thinking as they walk out of the theater, but you still need real resolution to this end. It didn't exist here and honestly, I found it laughable that this ending could be perceived by anyone to be resolute. My wife sat down half way through and we had a couple really good laughs in our disbelief, but she felt like it was a waste of her hour upon the "end" ending the way this played out. Perhaps this is just where the movie should have began. Think about it. Begin at the end, after the murder, flashback if you must...whatever, leave it however you want, but be real. I would be embarrassed to claim this sloppily done work after so much possibility. This was way too flawed even if we forget things like DNA and a slick ending, quite troubling considering the reviews here. Again, I like Lane, but great T &amp; A are not a category for Academy awards yet and I'm not convinced that Hayek was not more deserving for best actress than Nicole Kidman for her portrayal of the "goat" and wearing a prosthetic nose. Kidman was good for sure, and the role displayed her talent, but politics definitely play into certain circles....</fullReview>

Most of the scenes are way to long and soporific at best.

		<fullReview>I have to hand it to the script, and to everyone involved. UNFAITHFUL is a smartly played film, with the director obviously taking extra time and care to make sure everything is done right. But that's where the problems begin. Too much foreshadowing (the wind playing precursor to the affair as one example) and art (the final shot) gave UNFAITHFUL an ultimate cheese factor. Most of the characters have no conviction either. Richard Gere, much like George W. Bush, had used big words in his meeting with Olivier Martinez, but not enough emotion to sell them. But do not get me wrong. These little nuances do not change the whole of the movie, and UNFAITHFUL is a well made drama that does not turn stupid.Faithful wife gets into an affair when she runs into an attractive book dealer.Unlike most movies where a stupid struggle ensues, a fight, jealously transforms into madness, etc. etc. etc, UNFAITHFUL holds the moment and examines the behavior of all the characters. When studying the characters and waiting for what would happen next, two hours feels like nothing. Although UNFAITHFUL has no power within the characters to make itself great, this drama is still good enough to hold your attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning film with a stunning performance by Diane Lane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edward and Connie Sumner (Richard Gere of 'Pretty Woman' and Diane Lane of 'The Perfect Storm') have an idyllic life. Edward is handsome, caring and has a thriving business. His family is perfect. His wife Connie is a beautiful woman, good mother and loving wife. At least that is how things seem on the surface. Adrian Lyne's remake of Claude Charbrol's "La Femme Infidele" shows the shattering consequences of Connie's adulterous affair with a handsome, young Frenchman named Paul Martel. Adrian Lyne is known for his sexually charged thrillers: "Fatal Attraction" "9 1/2 Weeks" and "Indecent Proposal." "Unfaithful" is superior to those films due to the characters written by Alvin Sargent and William Broyles Jr. and wonderfully brought to life by the three lead actors. Mr. Lyne's debut film "Foxes" (1980) showed that he was able to deliver a well done, character driven movie. In "Unfaithful," Mr. Lyne directs with a subtlety and maturity that he has never shown before. Connie Sumner is shopping in New York during a particularly blustery day. The wind blows her into the arms of Paul Martel and the couple crashes to the sidewalk. Paul invites Connie up to his loft to clean her scraps and call her a cab. He gives her a book to remember the day. Connie finds herself attracted to the young man. She returns to Paul's apartment a few days later under the ruse of thanking him for his help. Third time's the charm. Connie returns again, unable to fight her attraction for the young man who knows all the right words to say. What follows is a torrid passionate affair. I enjoyed the fact that director Lyne didn't have Connie and Paul fall into bed on the first day. Connie seems to have everything she could want. She takes her time and weighs the risks at first. She's only flesh and blood and lust wins out. Connie indulges her mid-life crisis. Lyne doesn't give the audience a pat reason for her actions. Like the best films of the 70s, "Unfaithful" respects the audience's intelligence by not drawing us an overly detailed map of Connie's heart. Reality soon crashes down on the heads of the clandestine lovers. Edward begins to suspect something is amiss. The final shot is both ambiguous and satisfactory. Very haunting! "Unfaithful" is a morality tale that doesn't preach from the pulpit. Rather, the film takes an objective view of the characters and lets the audience reach their own conclusions as to how they will apply its lessons to their lives. This is a fine piece of adult filmmaking which is, along with "Jacob's Ladder," the best film Mr. Lyne has directed. The lion's share of the film's success must be given to the magnificent Diane Lane. She is guaranteed to be nominated for an Oscar for this role. It is nice to she her finally cast in a high-profile film which showcases her vast talent as an actress, rather than the co-star or supporting parts she usually gets. As Connie rides the train back to the suburbs after her first sexual encounter with Paul, she thinks back on the afternoon. She smiles, she cries, she laughs, she worries. Intercut with this scene are flashbacks of the lovemaking. Ms. Lane is a wonder to watch during this scene, as she is during the entire film! This is her movie. That is saying a lot as Mr. Gere and Martinez are also excellent. Richard Gere delivers a very introspective performance as the cuckolded Edward Sumner. I was reminded of Donald Sutherland's excellent low-key performance in "Ordinary People." This is the type of performance which is never recognized by the Academy, but which, nevertheless, anchors the film and gives it greater depth. Edward is clueless to the fact that his wife would even consider having an affair. Lyne bravely showed the couple being intimate twice in the film. Connie and Edward are making love. Connie obviously loves her husband, but she has an itch that Edward can't reach. Mr. Gere's performance is largely internal. He delivers more with a simple look than most other actors could with several pages of dialogue. Having said that, he is acted off the screen by Lane who is simply on fire in this film. Oliver Martinez is also quite good as Paul. He isn't pushy. He sends out his vibe to Connie. Like an experienced fly-fisherman, Paul is a patient seducer. He and Ms. Lane have great on-screen chemistry together. Though we know the affair will have to end, we envy their small hours of passion. This is great filmmaking which can make the viewer escape into the affair as it happens, but then fret and worry about the marriage when the lovers are apart. This film shows a maturity as a filmmaker that Mr. Lyne has only hinted at before. Let's hope that this is a new beginning for him. Let's also hope that Ms. Lane will finally be recognized for more than her ample and natural beauty. A stunning film with the best performance of the year in Diane Lane's stunning portrayal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who is unfaithful is a matter of opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All viewers wonder about the ending of `Unfaithful.' Some just don't understand what the movie was about, so they try to find a different interpretation than the obvious meaning.People wonder why a destructive situation like infidelity could have entered the lives of a couple whose lives seemed perfect, a couple who had a plush mansion outside New York and a son that makes them both happy, without a shadow in their future, a couple who have stylish suppers, go to charity meetings and engage in long love sessions. Most critics also wonder why a woman like Connie Summer (Diane Lane,) who has control over her life and is envied by her friends, is capable of cheating on her husband (a very successful man) with a Frenchman, accepting this devastating and dangerous affair, derailing the emotional stability, quiet and prudence of her marriage and violating her husband's trust.They also wonder why even in the most wonderful couples infidelity comes like an unexpected virus that, on occasions like this, leads to the most tragic results.Inspired by a French classic by Claude Chabrol, `La femme infidele'( `The Unfaithful Woman'), this Hollywood story about one of the worst things that can happen to people, begins with a simple premise: to be unfaithful, a man or a woman doesn't need to be unhappy with their mate or suffer from dysfunctions or sexual disappointments or be going through unresolvable crises or facing situations that are out of control. It's simply enough that the opportunity to be unfaithful is presented to the woman. In this case, she accepts the risk while fully realizing she can get very hurt.The opportunity comes with a background of New York streets full of galleries, bookstores, art theaters and small restaurants. The woman is walking along loaded down with a lot of bags. She's struck by the heavy wind and runs into a man (Olivier Martinez) carrying a lot of books. They help each other and he invites her to his place to wipe the blood off her knees; they exchange nice words, he gives her a poetry book and they say goodbye to each other. When she calls him to say thanks, he invites her to his place again.Fox asked the director to have the couple go through a crisis so that the infidelity would have an acceptable cause and the decision of the husband at the end of the movie would be clear. It seems like Lynne preferred an ambiguous ending.The cinematography in `Unfaithful,' like that of most of Lynne's movies, is so vivid that it makes you almost able to smell the bodies of the three main characters, and it allows you to travel over the skin of Diane Lane. The New York atmosphere is well created too. After the deceit and the some mild erotic scenes, the provocations, the reaction of the husband and the behavior of the lover, the viewer is left with a bitter sensation. The cruelty is not that the woman derails everything for her sexual addiction to the Frenchman, but to realize that infidelity has helped her to know how little, after many years of being a married couple, the two people know each other, how little grasp they have of each other's inner worlds. A selfish, irresistible stranger had to appear to make them learn to talk frankly to each other and look each other in the eyes.Despite its good qualities, the movie was a disappointment. It doesn't make clear what it wants to show. Some of the scenes with Lane are unnecessary. She seems to think that showing her naked body will save her, but it doesn't. Perhaps she saves us from tedium, but that's all. The whole movie is farfetched and it doesn't have a message where we all can learn something good from. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, Hollywood has produced a film that is very good, but not a classic to keep on file. Perhaps if it has not been seen in the theatres, it could be rented or purchased on DVD. There is an excellent progression of the story line. And the suspense held my attention throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic film with a brilliant star performance by Diane Lane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie I wish Hollywood would make more of. It's a brilliant film that has subtlety, style, class and depth. When you couple that to a truly remarkable performance by the films star Diane Lane, you have a winner. Diane Lane (The Perfect Storm, Streets Of Fire) plays Connie Sumner, whose whole life starts to full apart when she becomes obsessed with a handsome (and I mean HANDSOME) Frenchman. The effect of the affair that she indulges in are catastrophic and tragic, and are presented in a heartbreakingly haunting way. Richard Gere is also very good in the film as Diane Lane's cuckold husband, but this is a Diane Lane tour-de-force that should see her win an Oscar nomination. Judging by the films box-office and critical success, it seems that Adrian Lyne (Fatal Attraction) has served up another winner. Go see this film, if for nothing else, go see it for Diane Lane's acting. This movie and Lane's performance will stay with you. Excellent!</fullReview>

We are easily drawn into his web and he never seems like a truly bad guy. Nobody is to blame and defining good and bad is too simplistic - this is real life.The ending is just perfect although I was surprised when the credits rolled. Anyone who thinks this movie can have a different ending has not understood what has gone before. There can be no easy ending to such a situation in real life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think 'Unfaithful' deserves to be one of the best movies this year. Even though the plot is not very new, the way it has been interpreted on screen and the outstanding performances by Richard Gere and Diane Lane make this movie very unique. Throughout the movie, one can feel the emotional status that the characters are going through. Miss Lane reveals the conflict that Connie is experiencing so marvellously that I definitely think she must be nominated for the Oscar.One can't help but feel that there is an 'unfaithful' in everyone and it is important how you supress it because momentary decisions can make drastic changes which can never be repaired. One of the last scenes in the movie when Connie was thinking what would have happened if she didn't choose to go up to Paul's flat and took the cab instead was one of the most touching ones. In short, I recommend this movie to everyone who wants to see real life itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Diane Lane is sensational in another adultery classic by Adrian Lyne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adrian Lyne certainly seems to have what it takes to get people to the cineplexes to see his adultery thrillers. But despite grossing over $100 million at the worldwide boxoffice so far, "Unfaithful" is a far less commercial film than his 1987 blockbuster "Fatal Attraction". Despite it's "smash hit" status "Unfaithful" is a carefully and superbly crafted human drama. It's more like a character study than an all out thriller, but it sure has some great tension filled moments of deceit and erotic charged twists and turns. Diane Lane is the star of this film and it is her character, Connie, that the film concentrates on for the most part. Lane does a sensational job in making us care about Connie and her descent into a hell-ish situation all of her own making. Lane's performance is certainly one of the best of the year and the reviews for her have been great, but Richard Gere also does a splendid job in this film as well, showing a very different side. All in all "Unfaithful" is a cracking film that whilst not as "thriller-ish" as "Fatal Attraction" still seems to have something that people will buy tickets to see. Class, great direction, great acting and a thought-provoking finale. A quality and wonderful film. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Happily married housewife (Lane) engages in an affair with a mysterious Frenchman (Martinez), while husband (Gere) becomes more and more suspicious.Director Adrian Lyne (9 1/2 Weeks, Fatal Attraction) has chosen to concentrate on the effects of the affair upon the relationships within the film, rather than the standard 'husband seeks vengence' plotline and does so successfully. This is due to the terrific performances given by Gere, whom has never been better, and Lane, who is outstanding in conveying her characters dilemma.For a plot that could have been taken from any cable TV erotica, Unfaithful is a very deliberate, well crafted drama/thriller and makes for gripping viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The years best thriller with Diane Lane in astonishing form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adrian Lyne's adultery hit "Unfaithful" is not an original film, but it does take the whole genre to a new level. The fact that Diane Lane (who gives an astonishing performance in the lead) chooses to cheat rather than is forced to is very refreshing and probably more realistic. It is also interesting to see the woman cheat for a change. So few big Hollywood films are built around actresses, so again it was nice to see "Unfaithful" being a big movie built around Diane Lane rather than her male co-stars (Richard Gere and Olivier Martinez). Dewey from "Malcolm In The Middle" also shows up well as Diane Lane's son Charlie."Unfaithful" is a wonderful movie, with great development and great acting. The years best thriller with some of the years best acting in Diane Lane's astonishing portrayal. I can't wait for the DVD!</fullReview>

You could go into this movie, for about 15-20mins and probably be able to guess what happens all the way throughout til the end.The acting wasn't too bad, just the script wasn't that exciting.I was kind of hoping that there would be a good reason for the female lead to have committed adultery, such as a bad marriage, husband cheating on her, or even just ignoring her or some reason at least, but I couldn't find anything except she just seemed to feel like having an affair.The new love interest is your typical good looking, well built guy, with the mandatory french accent. Can you say stereotypical??Also the story seemed to be dragging on when it could have been a little shorter, the exact same story would have been told.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It raises the bar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of a straying wife in an erotic-turned-thriller film is pretty much a well established subgenre in the movie industry.One can be certain that it will contain several invariable ingredients like nudity, explicit sex, an almost unbelievable good lover as the man outside the marriage and as a general rule, at least one of the three involved will die.However, results may vary depending on the quality of those ingredients, which is quite evident in the case of Unfaithful. An experimented and skilled director, along with excellent actors, make a whole world of difference, even for a plot that is probably as old as the institution of marriage itself. Unfaithful is, in this sense, sort of a closure film, rather than ground breaking or even originally told. By no means, of course, will this be the last of its kind.Richard Gere seems well adjusted to the role of supporting character for female co-stars that steal every scene, which also happened in Pretty Woman.In short, Unfaithful raises the bar for the cheating wife subgenre and is very unlikely that we will see another comparable film about this subject any time soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect performance by Diane Lane raises Unfaithful to must-see status!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfaithful is genuinely a very, very good film. I would even go as far as calling it a great film, but what really makes this film so different from other films of this genre, is that it is the female who is Unfaithful AND she has no real reason to be. The only reason is circumstance itself. To pull this off, the film-makers had to find a special actress in order to make the character of Connie sympathetic and vulnerable despite the wrong-doing she commits. They found the perfect 'star' in consummate actress Diane Lane (from The Perfect Storm and A Walk On The Moon). Lane's performance is perfection. She is so vulnerable and heartbreakingly sympathetic despite being to a certain extent the villainess. It is her actions that have tragic repercussions that will reverborate forever, yet she is also so likeable. It takes a great actress to pull that off and Lane does it superbly while keeping us glued to the screen with her wonderful facial expressions and outstanding beauty. Richard Gere shines in the second half of the film, but this is Lane's film and she raises Unfaithful from merely a great film to a whole new level. This is a must see performance and a must see film. The best of 2002 so far and with over $100 million at the worldwide box office so far it is a deserving critical and commercial hit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing that I love about films like this is that you can debate them afterwards and you still think about them afterwards. I love intelligent and thought provoking films that are also entertaining and compelling. However, I cannot remember an intelligent thriller being this sexy, cool and downright GREAT in a long, long time. The acting is nothing short of amazing. Diane Lane is a marvel in the film and it is a measure of her immense talent that her great performance never, ever seems O.T.T., false or hammy. It is just such a human and "normal" performance that makes us so sympathetic to an unsympathetic character. Lane carries the film on her shoulders and this is HER movie. One of the things that separates this from the "Fatal Attraction" genre is that there is no real villain. The villain is circumstance and human weakness. This has to be the thriller of the year for me. A really great film that is nearly a perfect motion picture. I hope Diane Lane is gonna be making space in her cabinet for a nice Gold Statue next year, she sure deserves it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faithful to the male version of history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scanning the 200 or so entries to date on this film, I was struck by how polarised opinions were. Moral `liberals' generally liked it and thought it had a lot to say about infidelity while moral `conservatives' generally hated it. The strange thing is that Adrian Lyne, a specialist at portraying twisted sex in movies, has here promoted the conservative position (to coin a phrase), indicating that adultery is a Very Bad Thing and the perpetrators will pay for their sin (or ought to). However he wraps it up in such glossy sex scenes, and has such a sympathetic leading lady that your average moral conservative, a species not noted for subtlety of thought, sees Lyne as actually promoting unauthorised bed-hopping. I thought the first half or so went to make the point that even nice people from Westchester County can stray on occasion and perhaps need to be forgiven by their significant other rather than being treated like dirt, or even worse, have their transgression used as an excuse for a bit of mindless violence. This brings us to the actions of the husband on discovering what Connie is up to with Paul, the sexy French book dealer (a pure fantasy figure). All right, he didn't actually go into Paul's Soho apartment with the idea of topping the guy ? it just happens after a few minutes of edgy conversation and a couple of Vodkas (oh, the harm that drinks does). All the same, it's murder and people ought to go to jail for that ? the crime passionale doctrine has not been entered New York law, to my knowledge.Well of course at the end jail is still a possibility as Lyne thought it was more arty not to give us a definite ending, unlike Claude Chabrol in his version of the same story (La Femme Infidele). But I do think there's something peculiar about the almost total lack of communication between husband and wife as they realise what each other has been up to. What sort of relationship is this? Is there really a relationship? Anyway, I hope they enjoy Hawaii. It's certainly warmer than Tarrytown, NY. I enjoyed the first half of the story a lot, despite or maybe because of the improbability of some of the sex scenes. But the second half degenerated into an unsuspensful thriller. Lyne has a superb visual sense and like Stanley Kubrick he packs an amazing amount into every scene. His New York City windstorm, in which Connie and Paul meet, might seem unrealistic, but it is a clever way of seeing it from her point of view. Diane Lane as Connie is absolutely brilliant and the combination of her acting and Lyne's direction takes us right into her character's mind. Lyne is less successful with Richard Gere as the husband, but here the script is an obstacle ? Gere is OK but the part does not develop. We have the same stone-face businessman at the end as we meet at the beginning. As for the kid ? I'd drown him.I think literature has been a bit tough on the Madam Bovarys of this world and Adrian Lyne puts his heroine through the wringer too. What about the men, huh? Why is it always worse when a woman does it? Baby, you've got a little way to go yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't go to Richard Gere movies just to see him. Although the company with whom I went to this movie did. They got more than they bargained for.The movie starts out with the extramarital affair of Connie developing slowly. Although the marriage is a good one, she still becomes 'unfaithful'. I find that the movie poses a very interesting premise on cheating and being (un)faithful in a marriage or relationship. Things do not have to be 'bad' to go wrong. A VERY interesting topic to talk about after the movie, be it about cheating and the effects on a relationship (trust, mostly), or forgiveness and how difficult it can be to give it.Then, in stead of developing the story into something interesting where the couple tries to deal with the situation (or not; ending in a divorce), Edward (Richard Gere) commits a "Crime Passionel" and kills the boy his wife has been cheating him with.The rest of the movie deals with him getting rid of the body and the guilt of the crime that keeps haunting the pair. A rather disappointing end to a movie which started out with a very promising story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DIANE LANE gives one of the ALL-TIME GREAT performances in this ASTOUNDING and RICH film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a professional actor and closet playwright, I spent much of this movie humbled by what has to be, if not THE greatest, one of the greatest displays of emotional and spiritual/artistic courage ever to be put on screen. DIANE LANE (of The Perfect Storm fame) makes Anthony Hopkins' journey to find Hannibal Lecter within himself for THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS seem like a walk in the park.There are five movies that come to mind when I think of the subject of infidelity. Before this, the other four were Bertolucci's BESEIGED with Thandie Newton, of course FATAL ATTRACTION, Spike Lee's message about race JUNGLE FEVER, and DAMAGE, with an incredible role by Jeremy Irons. BESEIGED is a European art film that seeminlgy tastefully ends where the difficult questions infidelity brings to mind begin. FATAL ATTRACTION seemed to be written by women who were too afraid of being in love with cheatin' heart men to make any art; under the surface it was almost too campy in its portrayal of the crazed lunatic woman as heart of moral parable--the price of Man's playin' out on Woman--to be taken seriously. JUNGLE FEVER, as much as I love Spike when he's at the top of his game, went soft on us by making the messenger (sexuality as the basis of American racism) more important than the message (the fragility of the marriage relationship and the human soul). And DAMAGE was like a more adult version of FATAL ATTRACTION, in that it seemed to be a study of an obsession that would have destroyed a marriage if lust never came to be what drove it, not lust, marriage or infidelity itself.UNFAITHFUL is a movie that needs to be seen for a person to understand how it towers above and achieves everything that the four I just mentioned tried to do (or should have). The best double feature I could think of would be pairing this with AMERICAN BEAUTY; UNFAITHFUL could easily be seen as a sublime lesson in what the suburbs can do to the soul, and how it as such can be more dangerous to the soul than the ghetto's crime rate can be to the body and mind. *Boredom* seems to be the only motivating force leading to the eventual destruction of their entire lives in this movie--a woman's boredom. And yet what makes this film so powerful (other than, again, the triple-Oscar winning performance of DIANE LANE) is the fact that it is so well written and masterfuly directed--not to mention achieves ensemble with its supporting cast of men and women--that a clear cut motivation really does not exist. Glen Close was just crazy; Michael Douglas was just selfish; Jeremy Irons was just strung up too tight and a profoundly manipulative woman snapped him; Wesley Snipes (according to Spike) just had to have some White-ness; Thandie Newton was heartbroken...everyone had a clear cut motivation for their actions (otherwise known as the megaphone for the director in question's ideas about life [or the marketplace]), except DIANE LANE in UNFAITHFUL. And that is what will really disturb you to the point of needing to take a couple days out and digest the lesson on human nature you have been given by the time the credits role.If you are a RICHARD GERE fan, you will be surprised over the fact that, as good an actor as he is and can be, he triumphs in this movie almost purely by staying out of DIANE LANE's artistic way! He deserves a *most generous supporting actor* Oscar. My girlfriend's life was changed by what she saw in this movie (it deeply frightened and overwhelmed her); and I think mine was too. If you are in love or married, see this movie at your own risk. But see it. It is an astounding film, but even if you do not see it for it's story or themes--see it for some of the most amazing acting (DIANE LANE) you'll ever see. 10 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable Lyne-ish - minor twist on usual triangle skinflick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Gere plays the devoted husband whose wife has an adulterous fling with a young Frenchman. Although there are some plot twists (the less you know the better any luck you might not guess them, obvious as they are), the main factor that makes this film stand out is the fact that we have a man who is cheated on rather than the other way round. Given that the film doesn't aspire to much anyway, this is reasonably interesting perhaps men and women lie in different ways and watching the facial expressions and excuses that guilty wife Connie Sumner comes out with can make interesting and familiar watching to any man who has ever been cheated on. Director Adrain Lyne (Flashdance, Nine and a Half Weeks, Fatal Attraction) comes out with a predictable amount of flesh, soft-focused and made aesthetically acceptable enough to female audiences (he spent years making TV ads!) whilst still offering lazy titillation to late night male viewers probably watching it with their girlfriends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an affair and a moral lesson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was not quite what I expected. It is about a women who has an affair with a young French man that she accidentally runs into on Mercer Street in Soho. The movie proceeds to deal with her emotions and how she handles the affair and the lies that she tells to her husband. That is what I expected the whole film to be about and I enjoyed that aspect of the film. About halfway through the movie, the focus becomes extreme, seeming to say that affairs are wrong instead of being an exploration and letting the audience decide for themselves. So, the first half of the movie was excellent and the second half sucked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great start,bad finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again,director Adrian Lyne delves into the complicated world of sex.As in all of Lyne's sexually oriented films,we have a great example of how easily one can be lured into a sexual affair.It's a lot easier than most people believe.This time,the tables are turned,and it is the woman displaying weakness.While this film starts out strong,and leads you to believe that there will be an equally strong finish,the finish is anything but strong.In fact,I consider it horribly lame.Just when you think the strong finish is coming,something happens that makes you go,"Why did they do that?".The film took an entirely disappointing route from this point.As for the acting,Diane Lane and Olivier Martinez give credible performances,while Richard Gere tended to overact in places.My opinion? Save your money!This film will only build you up just to let you down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Gere never ages. He seems to have a problem with his wives in movies; they do not fair very well. I would not be surprised if this was a remake of a French film. It had an European style to it. Richard Gere plays the loving husband and Diane plays the wife that has too much time on her hands. The reverse of fatal attraction. A bit long. When events spin out of control, it leads to a tragic fate. This film is suspenseful which Richard is great at. 7/10</fullReview>

The theatre was packed to the brim .. 30 minutes before the movie started. During this very well portrayed life situation...I had observed the theatres audience..who consisted of the obvious cohort...woman ages 20-40. The surprisingly unexpected group of persons there other than the scattered male...was the senior men and woman...coming together in couples. For the steamy(ness) of this movie...I felt a little funny have grandma and grandpa seeing such awesome sexuality. I do understand though they too still have the need for sensuality and explicitness in their lives...(I'm Not that nieve)The HUSH that come over the theatre was unbelievable several times throughout the film. It was that INTENSE!..Its a HAVE to see movie and a Have to BUY when it comes out on DVD movie. EXCELLENT EXCELLENT JOB.I am planning to see it again this week..I truly loved it that much..Go See IT YOU wont be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is exciting! It starts off nice and cool and then that day comes when she meets Mr. Perfect! And then everything goes awry when the husband snaps. I couldn't believe it. The movie has its mountains and valleys but never leaves you hanging. What I didn't like about it was how the wife never turned her husband in. Adultery is a sin, not a crime. Murder is both! I started thinking of this movie as a cross between Intersection anothe Richard Geer movie and Fatal Attraction. The same premise is there. Where the spousal character kills the cheetee. That part was completely unbelievable. The fact that Geer replaced the Water buble back at their house was almost an act of arrogance. I don't know why he couldn't have just told her that he knew she was having an affair. He got in trouble when he went to the guys apartment. But, that just shows you how stupid men are. The guy should not have let him in! He too was caught of guard when the globe started crushing his skull!This movie was great! I would recommend it to any adults interested in a mystery like movie.</fullReview>

There was very little character development prior to the affair beginning, and you ask yourself, "was this little french guy really cute enough for her to just fall down and spread her legs for?" Probably not! You have no reasons why she would do this. After the fact, the development of Diane Lane's character is really interesting, and great to watch, but the set-up stinks.

Diane Lane deserves special recognition for giving a performance mostly in eyes and body movements (no pun intended) to create a perfect sense of dissilutionment (and I like that she's a beautiful older woman who isn't ashamed to show some skin and action), and even Richard Gere gives more than is usually warranted as her confused husband. Some scenes almost have nothing to do with the rest of the picture, and even that works something to. This is a work that needs to be seen, though it is not 100%. A or A-</fullReview>

This is quite a scintillating tale full of secrecy and eroticism, indulging the mind in simple pleasures of asphixiation and intrigue. Diane Lane is ravishing in this film, never giving less than her best to portray the embattled Constance Sumner. I always thought Adrian Lyne had disappeared, but he makes a strong comeback with this stark tale of infidelity and jealousy. Too bad it was released between two of the biggest movies of all time, or else this film would most likely do better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know whether I would like this film or not, but the reviews had been great and I heard good things about it from other people. The trailers and TV spots looked interesting but nothing new.I was completely blown away by how red hot and sexy this film was. It was so cool to see a film be sexy and erotic without being gratuitous or too obvious. This film is a perfect mix or unpredictability, coolness and sexiness. It has everything, and the performances by all the very attractive actors were wonderful. Diane Lane really delivers some amazing acting and her character was so likeable yet she did all the wrong things. It takes a great actress to make us feel like that. This film has been getting great reviews and they are deserved because it is red hot entertainment of a classy nature. RollingStone called it a scorcher and I wholeheartedly agree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only all thrillers could be as good as this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an excellent thriller. For those of you who love subtlety and atmosphere, and films like "The Others", "The Sixth Sense" etc etc then this is for you. It isn't a supernatural thriller like those, but it does share the same atmospheric and eerie suspense and haunting cinematography. It is a real cut above the usual Hollywood thriller and that combined with the stars exceptional and committed performances makes "UNFAITHFUL" a great alternative to the "Spider Man" and "Star Wars" movies.It actually appeals to me that we as an audience are respected in this film. Everything you think is gonna happen doesn't and everything you don't expect to happen does. The film sounded un-original when I read about it before seeing it. But it was a cracking film that had me transfixed.Olivier Martinez is an absolute beauty. He is one of the most gorgeous men I have ever seen, and he isn't just about looks. This boy can act too. Richard Gere looks good in the film and also turns in a great performance very different from his usual 'stud' type thing. Diane Lane is simply amazing in the role of Connie. Her character is the focus of the film and Diane Lane holds the film together remarkably well. Her performance is certainly the type that wins awards."Unfaithful" is certainly one of the best drama/thrillers to come along in a long while. And for those who love subtlety and suspense, it will be hard to beat. The great performances just add to the films undoubted class. A 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good remake of Chabrol's "La Femme Infid?le"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Unfaithful" is a movie that at first starts as drama and then after while transforms in thriller (after murder). Director Adrian Lyne is a master in this genre. Most of his movies talk about same things and always there is strong bond between man and women that is very erotically shown to us, viewers. From his first movie of that type - "Nine 1/2 Weeks", Lyne continued with "Fatal Attraction", "Indecent Proposal", "Lolita" and finally "Unfaithful". "Unfaithful" is story about two people: Connie (Diane Lane) and Ed Sumner(Richard Gere), who live in marriage from dreams. They've got young son, beautiful house and enough money do live careless life. During trip to Manhattan, Connie meets 10 years younger man, Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez) who sells and buys books. Soon Connie starts passionate relationship with Paul. Ed suspects on his wife so he hires private detective to follow her.This is one of Lyne's best films. On top is definitely "Jacob's Ladder" and after that "Unfaithful" is here with "Fatal Attraction" and "Lolita". In the story of cheating wife Lyne puts problem of marriage crisis and jealousy. Diane Lane was very good in her role and surprisingly Richard Gere also did good job. Diane Lane was very brave to accept this role and Oscar nomination is award for her.After all this positive things about this movie now I have to say few bad things. For me, it is quite impossible for a women who is married and has son and everything she wants to involve in this kind of connection with younger man. OK, she did it and I can even pass that but why after everything she sends him message that is over between them. What? She realized that things cannot go the way she planed? What did she planed? Lots of questions and Lyne breaks them with scene when Gere and Martinez have conversation in Martinez's apartment. After that movie goes in whole different way and that is again something good because in the middle story gets a little boring.And only one information. This is remake of legendary Claude Chabrol's movie "La Femme Infid?le". "La Femme Infid?le" is much better movie then "Unfaithful" but Lyne's try also counts. At least he made a decent remake with stars like Richard Gere and Diane Lane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfaithful is more of a serious drama, then a erotic movie. I think it has a great realistic storyline for a change. I personally know a few girls in similar situations as Diane Lane. Diane Lane gave the BEst performance of her career in this movie. She plays a mother and housewife, but still looks very sexy. Richard Gere gave a decent performance as the husband who finds out about his wife. Oliveir Martinez plays the guy that starts the affair in a average role. The DVD has some deleted scenes which are quite funny. One particular scene is in the Cinema, Where Diane and Oliveir are love making, while watching the movie. The Sex scene have been directed quite nicely. Especially the scene in the hallway, a bit of yes and no. I think Unfaithful is one of the sexiest movies of all time.</fullReview>

They start a steamy love affair, but Connie's husband, Edward, does find out. He confronts Paul and murders him, technically he's just out of his mind for the moment. The FBI investigates, obviously Connie is caught between all the lies with Edward.

		<fullReview>What would you do if you found out that your spouse was having an affair outside of your marriage? Most likely what most people do when it happens to them -- go to marriage counseling or seek a nasty divorce. Edward (Richard Gere) does something different: he kills the man his wife is seeing and tries to cover up the crime. It is, in a way, the perfect murder -- no one else knew about the affair his wife was having, no evidence traced the victim to his killer. At least that is what Edward thinks as he rushes to attend his son's school play.Soon the irony starts and the tension builds. Edward gave his wife, Connie (Diane Lane), a snow globe as a present. She then gave it to her lover (Olivier Martinez). And when Edward finally confronts his wife's newfound boy toy prior to the killing, he sees the globe sitting near his bed. "Where did you get this?" he asks, before delivering a massive blow to the side of his enemy's face and inadvertently killing him with the glass ball.It's an accident. He didn't mean to kill the man and he didn't even mean to overreact. But as the reality of the affair bombards his senses, Edward literally collapses, sent into a spiraling downfall of vengeance and anger.It's Richard Gere's best performance -- ever. I'm not a fan of Gere, but he brings so much raw intensity and reality to his character here that it's hard to not realize his performance as one of the best of the decade thus far. Observe his facial features as he examines the bedroom of his wife's lover. Imagine yourself in his place and imagine yourself not reacting the exact same way.But Gere is also able to bring a touching sense of love and humanity to Edward. His affection for his wife is as clear as sparkling water, and the day she comes home after encountering her new boyfriend he suspects something is wrong. Watch Gere in this film and you'll soon find yourself reconsidering whether or not he's that bad of an actor. I know I did. And you actually empathize with him. This is the man whose films have made more money the more he has become naked on-screen; the man who is renowned for being a playboy hotshot and a sleazy celebrity pretty boy. But yet in "Unfaithful," Gere abandons this self-made image, and plays a meek, nerdy family man living a modest life with a wife and a son. He wears glasses, lives an ordinary wife and actually respects his wife. His performance is spot-on and heartfelt, to say the least. I could have imagined almost anyone playing this role, except Gere. His performance is amazing.After killing Martinez and dumping the body in the back of his car, Edward takes the snow globe home. He places it on a shelf behind many other souvenir globes. Imagine Connie's surprise when she sees it there, and imagine the irony in the situation: they both know that they know each other's secret. Yet since they both are shameful of what they are done, they are too scared to confront each other, for fear of being accused of their own crimes."Unfaithful" is one of the most elegant and firmly constructed thrillers in years -- realistic, cruel, ironic, and irreverently erotic. It's not your standard-issue sleaze. It's not all heavy on sex and style like "Basic Instinct" and it's not pure stupidity, either. It's actually a thriller rooted in a touching story of marriage and faith, and everything else gradually follows thereafter.Like "A Simple Plan," "Bound" and "Fargo," "Unfaithful" is about one single event that suddenly causes a chain reaction of horrific ones. In "A Simple Plan," the moment that Hank took the cash was the moment his life changed forever. The moment that Corky's plan proceeded forwards in "Bound" was the moment that all hell broke loose and everything went wrong. And the moment that Jerry Lundegaard sent those two bumbling idiots on their way to kidnap his wife and hold her ransom was the same moment in time that his life would begin to dramatically fall apart, almost overnight. And the moment that Edward strikes his wife's lover with a small glass snowball is the moment that both of their wives -- his own and his wife's -- change forever. I love these sorts of movies, the kind that take your average, innocent passersby and place them in an unfortunate chain reaction that leads to a major downfall in their lives. Why do I love these movies? I think for the same reason that has made them all so successful: we love to watch characters corrupt themselves and get caught in conspiracies where they are literally fighting to stay above water. The scene in "Fargo" where Jerry's plan falls apart all at once is a great example of this.This is Adrian Lynne's crowning achievement. It's glossy and masterfully, beautifully constructed. It's eerie and realistic and has a noticeably strong, yet strangely subtle, presence. I cannot imagine a more effective, sensitive and touching adaptation of this story that will surely hit close to home for many people out there. Even if it's not relative to your life, you will still find yourself deeply absorbed by the lead characters and their turmoil. "Unfaithful" has its flaws, but I find it hard to think of a more effective and beautiful thriller of its genre made within the past five years.4/5 stars. - John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing new here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Warning: spoilers ahead!)Like 'A Perfect Murder', minus the charisma of Michael Douglas. The story and images in this film are unbearably stereotyped, from the sexy latin-lover and his trendy inner-city apartment to the manila envelope of classic black-and-white photographs snapped by the private investigator. We can usually forgive a film for its reliance on stereotype if its strengths lie in plot or character development. The problem is, 'Unfaithful' offers audiences neither. There is not one single moment of true suspense, but instead many brief instances that unfortunately arouse little more in viewers than 'oh look, something's happening'. Lane's slip into infidelity is sudden and awkward, and the events following Gere's crime should be climactic, but aren't. Worse still, the characters in this film have no depth. We learn absolutely nothing of Lane's character, and instead we are given a generic, every-woman, insert-name-here cheating wife. Similarly, Gere represents little more than a successful man who despises betrayal. I can name TV movies with greater exploration of character. Lane's Oscar nomination for Best Actress is simply bewildering. She's not bad, but she ain't good. To be frank, she looks simply ridiculous stumbling around the city with post-orgasmic smile on her face, while Gere's unfortunate selection of glasses contributes to the narrowing of his acting range into one single facial expression of 'confused ferret'.The sex scenes are awkward, and one gets the impression that the director has tried much too hard to make them sexy. Moreover, the actors' attempts at sexual aggression are contrived and incredibly unbelievable.There's nothing worse than a nit-picker, but I must say I simply could not believe that Gere's character would really have been so stupid as to return the snow dome back to its place in the family home. Similarly, the convenient use of the New York city stranger offering to help Gere lift the heavy bundle into his car seems somewhat at odds with the usual Hollywood portrayal of New York streets as harsh and unfriendly. But now I'm being pedantic. Highly unoriginal and nothing new to offer.</fullReview>

She won an Oscar and Golden Globe nomination for this performance and it is easy to see why. She is sexy, believable and very sympathetic in this role and she is supported well by a cast against-type RICHARD GERE. It is a thriller with plenty of twists and turns and it is very cool, stylish and entertaining, as well as being thought-provoking. However, as many critics have noted it is DIANE LANE who makes this film so exceptional. 10/10. Great thriller!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was OK, but I was expecting better because of Diane Lane's oscar nomination. She was OK, but I don't think she really deserved the nomination and I'm glad she didn't win any awards for this movie. Her character just isn't sympathetic. And how does it take much acting skills to be in a bunch of sex scenes with a hot French guy. First of all, the movie never explains if she was unhappy in her marriage or what. So, why does she have an affair because all the scenes between her and Richard Gere make their marriage seem OK. Was this her first affair, had her husband ever had an affair? It just wasn't believable that this house wife with a kid would decide to call the French guy back with a flimsy excuse to meet him for coffee.Also, the murder of the French guy is not to exciting. He just gets bashed in the head. I thought Diane Lane would help her husband hide the murder or something like that, but that never happens. Also, this movie was a little too long. It should have been 15 minutes shorter. There was plenty in the beginning that could have been cut out.FINAL VERDICT: It is OK for what it is. So, if you are looking for slow paced drama with some flesh scenes, then this wouldn't be a bad choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This came on cable last night. Diane Lane IS an actress and deserved the nomination going through all those emotions and being able to make me feel what she was feeling. That is such a gift!Then there is the movie itself. Ya just wanted it to be a bit better. Some parts will keep ya interested, others will make you look at the back of your eyelids.Which takes me to the most interesting thing about this film. Stick with it. It has alot of holes and for the first hour I was thinking.."Oh a typical Lifetime Movie", then it went in a direction I didn't see coming. The resolve could have been better, but this film may not be as HORRIBLE as many peg it to be.The tone of the film also needed work. After it was over I thought, if Adrian Lyne filmed this in back and white, set the characters and story to the 30's/40's or maybe even the early 50's..this might have been an interesting piece of work. Being Contemporary with a very boring (at least to me) guy Ms. Lane is having the affair with, make the piece snoozy.If it's a rainy day, you're by yourself and have nothing to watch, (meaning you've seen "The Elizabeth Broderick Story" parts one and two on Lifetime TV enough times) and feeling kinda gloomy, this may be the film for ya.Not a bad or horrible film...it's just...okay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Infidelity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you look back on his career, you'll notice a cinematic pattern in the directoral choices of Adrian Lyne. 'Lolita', 'Indecent Proposal' 'Fatal Attraction', '9 1/2 Weeks' all share the same core themes of sex, obsession and consequence. Upon deeper observation, perhaps Lyne's own attitudes towards sex and relationships are revealed, along with what would appear to be a vehement distrust of women.What these films are really about is power and it's possessor. The one who would appear to have it would be the strong and sexually charged femme fatale who has set out to control and destroy the heart/family/career of her male lead. However, it is the male who ultimately prevails, any shadow of guilt cast upon his character consequentially forgiven in light of his strife caused by the evils that women do. 'Unfaithful' doesn't veer far off the mark.On the surface Edward and Connie Sumner, played by Richard Gere and Diane Lane, appear to be a happily married couple. Indications that their 11-year marriage is headed south isn't detailed, only eluded to as we witness Connie's hectic morning ritual. Maybe she is not so much unhappy, but a bored suburbanite in need of a little excitement. A chance meeting with a smoldering French book dealer gives her all that and more as they enjoy hot, sweaty monkey sex all over the city. These scenes are the only ones of value in the entire film. It was the early 80's when the lovely Diane Lane first caught our attention. After her portrayal as the virginal Cherry Valance in 'The Outsiders', she went on to star in a couple more time capsule favorites of that era including 'Rumblefish' and 'Streets of Fire'. Though she worked steadily for the next two decades, it wasn't until 'Unfaithful' that she achieved the attention she has worked so hard to achieve. As uncomfortable as you'd think it would be to shoot a sex scene, Ms. Lane is flawless. You see her character at first as vulnerable, then brazen, caught up in the throws of her affair. Watching her, the expression in Lane's face reveals so much more about her character's inner struggle than her dialogue. Her first sexual encounter with the Frenchman literally had her shuddering. This scene in particular transcended the screen and shook me as well. The potency and strength of her performance is deserving of an Oscar, even if the film itself doesn't.I honestly fell asleep three nights in a row trying to finish this movie. There was not enough suspense between the sex to keep me enthralled. We know the gig is up once Edward catches Connie in a lie and hires a private investigator (a nice cameo appearance by Dominick Chianese of 'The Soprano's'). But the rest of this film doesn't solve the mystery of the affair for Edward. I would have been more satisfied if the movie revealed more of the characters themselves instead of ditching the intimacy for an easy ending. If the ending had been more realistic, 'Unfaithful' would have dared to delve into the core of human emotion to see what we find. Instead, the writers chose a predictable ending the rest of the film did not deserve.Of all Adrian Lyne's films, I would have to say I enjoyed 'Jacob's Ladder' the most. Though it was more surrealistic than his usual psychological thriller, it had substance. 'Unfaithful' contains none.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Unfaithful" tells of a happy suburban homemaker who has an extramarital affair with profound consequences. Although there's little new in this film (an affair is an affair is an affair), it does excel in art and technicals but it's Lane's world class performance which makes the 2+ hour run worthwhile. And, though there is some steamy sex, the film concentrates on the way the adultery reverberates through the family unit with ominous rumbling undercurrents until husband and wife find themselves squeezed mercilessly between the need for normalcy and the knowledge that it is impossible to regain. A slick and serious minded drama for mature adults worth a look. (B+)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Diane Lane gives astonishing Oscar worthy performance in another Adrian Lyne masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the qualities that separates Adrian Lyne's latest study of infidelity from other "Cheatin' Heart" types of movies is that it neither glorifies nor vilifies any single character. There is NO villain in the movie, just circumstance that leads three attractive, yet ordinary, people on a collision course with a tragic destiny. Most movies about cheating spouses have an abusive or neglectful husband, or a mentally unstable wife, or a psychopathic stranger who seems nice at the beginning. "Unfaithful" completely avoids all this familiar stuff and goes for a more mature and more realistic approach. The film is as much a character study as it is a thriller. That said the film is all the more engrossing, thought-provoking and "different" for it. DO NOT expect "Fatal Attraction 2" or a "Fatal Attraction" with the roles reversed. "Unfaithful" is more than that, but is also less than that.Diane Lane ("The Perfect Storm", "Judge Dredd", "Murder At 1600") and Richard Gere ("Primal Fear", "The Mothman Prophecies", "Pretty Woman") play Connie and Edward Sumner. They have a seemingly idyllic life with a nice house, a stable marriage and a cute kid called Charlie (played by Erik Per Sullivan, who plays Dewey in "Malcolm In The Middle"). One very windy day while out shopping in New York, Connie is literally blown into a French book dealer called Paul Martel (played by the sexy Olivier Martinez of "Before Night Falls"). This then triggers a chain reaction of events that will consume them all and which lead to a tragedy that will reverberate forever. In "Unfaithful", Connie's affair with French boheme Paul just "happens," a mixture of serendipity and clouded decisions, a scenario probably far closer to reality than most of the contrived excuses usually made for the characters in such films. As a consequence all of the characters retain something very "human" in them, even if it is just a hint of sympathy.What is great about "Unfaithful" is the performances - we really care about these characters. Everyone is put through a living Hell and the emotions are etched on the actors faces with superb skill. Diane Lane's performance is remarkable and is, on it's own, worth watching this film for. It is THAT good. Lane's portrayal of the tragic Connie is almost certain to get her an Oscar nomination come February. The kaleidoscopic nature of emotions and conflicts that Connie finds herself awhirl in, particularly as she starts to come to grips with the aftermath of her initial infidelity, would be a major challenge for any actress, and Lane absolutely nails it. Without a 100% authentic performance in this crucial spot, perhaps we as an audience would have been quicker to damn Connie for cheating on a perfectly good husband and betray her family as Lane leads us along Connie's "downward spiral". Of course, it doesn't hurt that Diane Lane has a unique beauty about her, a "hot lady" quality that makes her a perfect personification of middle age desirability, appealing to a wide range of male demographics. Richard Gere is surprisingly great in a supporting role as the husband. It is a role we would never expect to see him play. I always see Gere as playing the lover, but here he is the tortured cuckolded husband and he delivers one of his best ever performances. It's just so different from what we expect from Richard Gere, and while it is not in the same league as Diane Lane's (he is given far less to do), he is far better and more animated then the Richard Gere people love to criticise. This is definately his best performance since his corrupt cop in 1990's "Internal Affairs". Olivier Martinez plays the stereotypical French hunk, but he does infuse his character with an abundance of charm and he will definately have the girls sighing. The guy does have something about him, and he holds his own against both Lane and Gere.Full credit should also go to Adrian Lyne, who both wrote and directed this film. Lyne also knows how to film a love scene with style and a sense of eroticism. He has enthused "Unfaithful" with style and class. It is not just erotic, it is provocative, sexy and cool. The film is not perfect and some may find the pacing a little on the slow side. Don't expect an action packed two hours whatever you do. It is refreshing to see Lyne come up with something different from such a tired genre. Definately recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hot and Racy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the movie was erotic and hot. I was fully impressed with the plot and flow of the film. It spoke to all us married or involved people as a "What would you do?" Would we, as women, forget our vows for a ride in the sack with the hot Olivier Martinez? Of course!!!! And would we give such sacred and precious gifts to our lover, even if that means letting go of memorable and special memories of our partner? The reaction of Richard Gere in the film as truly an honest reaction along with a schoolbook case of temporary insanity. I utterly enjoyed the film and was left refreshed with the romance and seduction of the film. But to speak that way of the end is giving the film too much justice. Even though we all would have struggled with that decision of turning ourselves in, shouldn't the director had stood on a moral soapbox and said....whatever his answer would be?</fullReview>

Gere wouldn't confront Lane about anything that went on. Come on! All the people here saying that it was a great performance by Lane is would say that Superbad is the best movie ever (while funny, Superbad is no Godfather or Citzen Kane). The best thing in this movie is the performance by the little kid....Erik Per Sullivan (what a name by the way), from Malcolm in the Middle. He is a breath of fresh air compared to the pompous and overly dramatic performances of the rest of the "adult" actors. Don't see how hard it is to get humped against a wall. Yeah, great acting! I guess the kid from the American Pie movie should be deemed the greatest actor ever for showing that Pie who's the boss. Would give it 0, but can't do that here for some reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Maybe spoilers?) Forget the trivial sideplot which has Diane Lane getting her kit off, this is a film about American Businessman Richard Gere killing a smelly frenchy and dumping his body on a landfill site.It has about nothing to do with Claude Chabrol's Femme Infidele (where it stole the elements of its plot). In Chabrol the murder is deliberate (but Richard Gere is such a hunk he just can't help killing wimpy French guys), and the wife's cover-up is motivated by complex but finally selfish thinking. (Diane Lane doesn't seem able to do motivation - at least not in this film).'Unfaithful' is xenophobic, shallow, predictable, and its sex-scenes are calculatedly disgusting. It is a Richard Gere film.Basically 'Unfaithful' is what is wrong with Hollywood.</fullReview>

Did you ever cheat yours husbands or wives? Did you ever have sex in public place? Of course you did. But can you imagine something equally moronic as saying (or screaming, or whispering) "Take me to heaven!" without indulgently? If it happened to you, it could mean that you have to deal with dangerous psychopath or Diane Lane.I don't understand how anyone can regard such a predictable screenplay serious. His banality is tremendous, acting - unconvincing, Gere waste his talent here. I would be glad if all this horrible family pay for theirs lack of style, lack of taste and stupidity.

		<shortDescription>Unfaithful...Who towards what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit I watched the film for the sake of Martinez's looks; didn't know anything about his acting abilities, but I sure did about Gere's: he is the exemplary case of the "internal" acting school, you know, the one the French are usually accused of. But Gere supplants it with a twist, a twist where nothing is twisted: all is purged from true psychic conflict, courtesy of neo-liberal fake spirituality, so, goodbye dramatic art.I went to such lengths because I think his brand of on-screen appearance (this is not acting) is such a quasi-anonymous phenomenon that fits perfectly the logic of the product, a.k.a. this movie. This movie spills out of its frame and becomes a sad and dangerous phenomenon, the dangerous phenomenon of neo-puritan moralism.Having admitted that I watched it for the sake of the french hunk's looks, I felt I was deprived of my guilty pleasure the moment he appeared on screen: yelling three times in a row "merde!", I knew that the sexual temperature would not rise beyond the heights of menopause and cardboard situations.But no, actually it got worse.You know the story: woman starts affair with hunk, hubbie finds out, visits "rival", has a fit, kills him, wifey finds outs, still consolidates their love blessed by the matrimonial God of Hollywood. Amen to that.Still, one question: who is unfaithful, and to whom, or what? The frankly inelegant appearance of the title, the white faithful turning into a bloody unfaithful word the moment un- sticks to faithful, already sets the tone of what the viewer is about to witness at his own risk. So, is it just a depiction of her infidelity? Or is it his the more profound infidelity, towards God's love? All right now give me a break! The high level of professionalism, with Hitchcock sprinkled allover, makes it even more disgusting.She is a good actress. I sympathized with her when towards the end it became somewhat evident that she did the best she could, battered as she was in such a bad script. Notice how in the end, when Gere proposes that they go to Mexico, she says "Mexico...!" in such a tacky way, you might think she said Tahiti, or some other glorious destination.Even usually clear-sighted critics took the bait: there is no actual dilemma here. The couple, if it wakes up, wakes up too late to its own adulthood, and unconvincingly. An adult viewer should take care of what is served to him or her. If there really was a re-emerging of love, this should be shown by its reversal: the situation is so radical, that only by betrayal they would redeem it. Either he should turn in, as he says at one point, or even better, their kid finds out and turns them both in! Otherwise it smacks of guilt and damnation to eternal calculation with the petty alibi of 'a human face', endurance through love, love and love which is actually guilt, guilt and guilt. Unfaithful, go to Mexico!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The writing in this film is horrible - the characters often don't have clear motives for their actions, so they come across differently than intended. The acting is equally as hollow and stiff and literal. The plot ends half-way through the film and a new crime plot starts after a STUPID (as in, poorly set up and unmotivated) killing of Paul with a bang of a thin-glass snow globe. That snow globe would more likely shatter not cause such a severe wound, and Paul would not die instantly anyway and would end up with brain damage rather. The rest of the plot is completely unnecessary - who gives a f*** how they deal with it when we know the consequence is that the adultery has scarred their marriage? Especially when in the end it leads to no real resolution (at least in the original plot...) Because of the writing and equally bad acting, I can't identify with any of the characters and hate them all by the end of the film. I'm not jaded by experiences or my values - I understand why Connie would do it, but the way her character is developed makes her just look like a b**** to her husband. And her husband, he comes across as having an inner socio-path. The kid - well he's just so obnoxious and terrible, I want to shoot him by the end of the film. Paul is a more likable character because he isn't lying as much as the rest of them, but then he doesn't respect Connie's wish to end the relationship. Also because of the writing, some of the sex scenes boarder on being almost pornographic and almost rape scenes because they are not supported by motives. Connie says no I don't wanna keep going repeatedly and then she has sex? Or Paul shows up at the café and they have sex in the bathroom while her friends talk about him? That's too close to fantasy.I also find this film has a terribly narrow audience: 40+ moms who have been married for a long time and possibly work 9-5 or are housewives and are very traditional, or a variant where the woman already has cheated on her husband or wants to. I can see this film's obvious commercial aim. It's obvious in not only the characters that are created (EXACTLY like their audience) but by making constant outcasting references to family life like tags sticking out of clothes - f***, that's not cinematic!My favourite part of this movie is when Connie almost gets KILLED by the shopping cart blowing down the street at the beginning and my favourite character is her racially discriminated black maid. I laughed most of the time watching this movie, and I could not 'suspend my disbelief'. Especially when the cinematography supported the stupidity of the plot - such as, a fast zoom in while Paul grabs at Connie leaving "seductively" - that was hilarious! I could not feel any sympathy for the characters because instead of coming across like adults, they handled the whole situation like teenagers and eventually children. It also sucked because at any point, the whole plot could've been smashed to bits easily by Connie or Edward telling the truth. The whole aspect of the plot being *irreversible* actions was non-existent. It could've stopped anywhere - which to me says, this is not a unique enough story. And since this film rips off a French film (that's probably way better), it isn't original. If there wasn't the whole second plot of the crime, this movie would be thinner than air.</fullReview>
