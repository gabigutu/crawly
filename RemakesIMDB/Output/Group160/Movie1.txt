		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Romantic Comedy Caper Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1960s Hollywood combined the classic "caper" film with a healthy dose of romantic comedy. The result was a series of charming films such as CHARADE (1963) and HOW TO STEAL A MILLION (1966)--films that combined major stars, clever plots, witty scripts and which balanced suspense with comic and romantic complications.Made in 1966 and released in 1967, GAMBIT was among the last of these films, and like all others in the genre it had a complex plot. Ahmad Shahbandar (Herbert Lom) is quite possibly the richest man in the world and a recluse to boot, a man who has never gotten over the death of his beautiful Eurasian wife some twenty years ago. Harry Dean (Michael Caine) devises a clever plan to gain access to his luxury apartment and rob him blind: he will use honky-tonk dancer Nicole Chang (Shirley MacLaine), who bears a striking resemblance to Shahbandar's long dead wife, to breach Shahbandar's defenses.There's only one problem: it won't work. To tell exactly why it won't work is to betray the plot, which is extremely clever; suffice to say that Dean has made a number of incorrect assumptions about both the situation and the personalities involved. When the plot begins to twist, it does so in a truly unexpected way, taking both Dean and the audience completely by surprise.This is the sort of film that Hollywood used to do so well but which we seldom see today, a frothy, glamorous confection with first rate production values and expert performances from major stars. MacLaine gets top billing, and she is quite fine, but the weight of the film rests on Caine and Lom, who give memorably dry performances, and director Ronald Neame (who was responsible for a host of memorable films including THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE) keeps everything moving along at a smart pace with plenty of style.This may not be the best of the genre--I think both CHARADE and HOW TO STEAL A MILLION, to name but two, outpace it. But even so it is a perfectly charming film, the perfect antidote to a drab afternoon. Just add popcorn! GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TWISTY FUN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although perhaps not in the same top-flight league as "Rififi" and "Topkapi," "Gambit" is nevertheless an extremely entertaining heist movie that features consistently fine performances, an amusing and twisty script, and good production values. In this one, Caine hires MacLaine, who is working as a dancehall girl in Hong Kong, to assist him in the purloining of a priceless piece of sculpture, owned by Herbert Lom. This is not your typical heist film, however, and there is a twist right around the first half-hour mark that really had me chuckling out loud...and I'm not an easy person to make laugh out loud at movies, either. MacLaine plays one of her patented loveable kooks in this film, and is ever so appealing. Caine, in his first American production, plays it alternately cool and exasperated. Lom is surprisingly good as Shabhandar, one of the world's wealthiest men; his performance is both urbane and beautifully modulated. Good in smaller parts are two faces that classic "Star Trek" fans will recognize: John Abbott (an Organian) as the French art connoisseur, and Roger "Harry Mudd" Carmel as a hotel clerk. The heist itself is fairly suspenseful and, I suppose, high-tech for its day. Both Caine and MacLaine display surprising derring-do and quick thinking, and toward the finale of the film, the viewer is treated to at least three unexpected twists of plot. "Gambit," thus, offers good suspense, real wit, some romance, colorful locales, and fine acting. It is a real winner. If you're a fan of the heist movie, this one will not disappoint. It's good, light, well-done fun, and infinitely more entertaining than recent, "serious" caper films such as "The Score" and "Heist." Check it out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid 60's entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this again, after a period of many years; I think that I must have seen it in its original release, and it would have seemed wildly glamorous and exotic at the time. Its always been a favorite of mine; I love it when MacLaine finally opens her mouth and starts talking, and the entire story tilts and veers off in an amusingly different direction.So very many things could have gone wrong with this production, and MacLaine could have completely overwhelmed it. Miraculously, everything stays in harness and no scenery gets chewed (as opposed to, say, "Topkapi", which although fun goes completely over the top, and where Mercouri lustily devours everything in sight). Caine and MacLaine were both in their early 30's at the time, and MacLaine gets away with photographing much younger. Its one of the earliest of her films where she got top billing; she had been making a series of Hollywood big-budget bombs, and I suspect that this somewhat modest entry kind of redeemed her. Its great straight entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forgotten comedy thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Caine uses flighty Shirley MacLaine to hopefully steal something from Herbert Lom--the richest man in the world.That's about all you need to know. This is a fun movie--nothing too serious about it. It's very colorful with some beautiful settings and outfits (get the white dress MacLaine wears). The script is sharp and sometimes very funny. MacLaine is full of life and fun in her role--quite an accomplishment since she has nothing to work with. Caine (a great actor) seems strangely muted in his role. Lom is having a fun time with his part. The comedy mixes very well with the action (MacLaine comes off best) and there are some really neat twists and turns at the end (although I saw the last one coming). This isn't an acting film--just a film to sit back with, turn off your brain and enjoy! Strangely this is pretty unknown--I didn't even now it existed till it turned up on TV unannounced! Well worth catching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brilliantly paced, gripping crime caper, the film has an interesting plot formula, and in general it is quite engaging stuff. Neame's vision of the film involves many close-ups and low camera angles, and this provides an enticing visual style. It is often amusing, with clever ideas, clever sets and wonderful costumes. MacLaine is also very good in an intriguing performance that involves her being silent for the first 25 minutes. So, what can one say against this film? It is a bit silly, a tad overlong, somewhat predictable, and not very deep, but as simple entertainment you cannot find many films better than this. I found it a joy to watch, and Neame's crafting as director can be admired too. It is a great film, even if not a masterpiece, although, for its genre, it could possibly be regarded as a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever and diverting heist caper with excellent leads...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MICHAEL CAINE was hot after appearing in THE IPCRESS FILE and SHIRLEY MacLAINE grabbed him for her leading man in GAMBIT. It's a highly entertaining and very clever crime caper and is Caine's first American film. It benefits from highly polished production values and Ronald Neame's expert direction, not to mention a story that has several unexpected twists.Aside from excellent performances by the two stars and Herbert Lom as the intended victim, the plot will keep you guessing until the final moments. Shirley is a knockout in her oriental disguise and delivers a wonderful performance as the girl who discovers she prefers an honest man to a thief, no matter how much she let herself be tricked into the role of a charming look-alike for Herbert Lom's former wife. The trick is to get into his lavish digs so she and Michael can see the layout and devise a plan to steal a prized sculpture. Herbert Lom is urbane and sophisticated as a man who is highly suspicious of his new acquaintances.If you like crime capers or jewel heists, this is for you. Diverting from start to finish with a particularly good opening sequence that sort of sets you up for a different kind of film than this actually is. But saying more than that would give too much away.My only complaint--Maurice Jarre's score is a skimpy one. He provides some light and catchy melodies for the lighter scenes but fails to deliver the goods for the film's darker moments. Maybe he figured the audience would just be holding their breath while silence accompanied the cat-like burglar approach rather than music. Whatever, the darker moments would have been heightened by a more suspenseful score.John Abbott is seen to advantage as a French sculptor devoted to his art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicole (Shirley MacLaine) works as a dancer is some shabby night club in Hong Kong. She is approached by Harry Dean (Michael Caine), a young cockney thief, who has thought out a brilliant plan to steal an invaluable piece of sculpture. The trick is that Nicole happens to be a spitten image of the late, beloved wife of multimillionaire Ahmad Shahbandar (Herbert Lom) who owns the sculpture."Gambit" is a consistently entertaining crime comedy with engaging performances from the principal actors. MacLaine in particular is rather impressive as the beautiful accomplice who keeps making difficult questions but can also be quite resourceful when needed. The plot contains a couple of neat twists and Ronald Neame's direction leaves no dead moments in the film. Also features a pleasing score by Maurice Jarre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Minor fun featuring Shirley MacLaine as a cabaret dancer who gets a chance to become a key player in a major heist masterminded by thief extraordinaire-wannabe Michael Caine. It has lots of twists and surprises, and it's fun, but the sleek, more serious opening moments prepare you for a totally different picture then the one you eventually get. It seems as though this is going to be classy stuff at first, but it's just a daffy live-action cartoon. Energetic though, and the leads work well together. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Note! Minor plot points to be discussed. Proceed at your own risk.One of my favourite genres - the caper movie! In most caper movies, the plan goes perfectly, at least until the heist is over. However, this one is probably unique as the careful plans of our chief thief, Michael Caine, keep going horribly horribly wrong, and right from the beginning to boot. Shirley MacLaine as his female accomplice and Herbert Lom as the "unwitting" victim are allowed their full range of intelligence and emotion as move follows countermove and bad descends to worse. The final plot twist at the end preserves a happy ending for everyone. Definitely worth a look, if you can find a copy or its playing late night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love heist flicks, and this overlooked item delivered the things I like about the best heist flicks: suspense, trickery, a plot twist or two, and humor. This is a dead-on heist/comedy that surprised me with a couple of twists.I've always been a Michael Caine fan, so naturally I'll tell you that his performance here is up to his high standards. I've never really been a Shirley MacClaine fan, though, so it was a surprise to me that she was so good in her role.What kind of summary can I give without giving everything away? Harry Dean (Caine) has his sights on some loot, but needs a partner for his scheme. Nicole Chang (MacClaine) turns out to be everything he hoped for. But he didn't count on her being as clever or as alluring as she turns out to be.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[***POSSIBLE SPOILER***] This film is representative of a certain type of slick, glossy caper film - e.g. 'Topkapi' - common in the sixties, and, for its type, this an excellent and rarely seen effort. The primary virtue is the cast, with Michael Caine, Shirley Maclaine and Herbert Lom playing very well off each other. Lom is particularly good as the suave and wealthy Shabandahr, proving to be a more wily target than Caine/Deane had predicted. A nice conceit of the flick is the opening segment which lays out how Caine/Deane imagines the caper will go, the rest of the movie then contrasting how reality does not play out as imagined. Well worth catching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the best laid plans don't get off the ground...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any film with Shirley Maclaine and Michael Caine has real potential for being delightful. Add to it Herbert Lom as a powerful, but not really bad fellow for a change, and it is headed for being terrific. What carries it to the top is it's sense of spoofing. For GAMBIT came at the end of the first sequence of crime movies where a scheme for the big robbery or whatever was the crime involved was carefully, step by step, explained to the audience as it was done. The best known of these films were THE ASPHALT JUNGLE, RIFFIFI, TOPKAPI, THE KILLING, OCEAN'S ELEVEN (the original one with Frank Sinatra). Normally the schemes are flawlessly carried out, but some small error blows the game away (such as THE LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN or THE LAVENDER HILL MOB), or there are internecine jealousies that destroy the plan (RIFFIFI, THE ASPHALT JUNGLE), or outsiders destroy the plan (THE KILLING, OCEAN'S ELEVEN). But GAMBIT changes this deliciously.The movie is actually two films, one about thirty minutes long (interesting but mechanical) and the other about eighty minutes long which makes a total hash of the initial film. We see Caine and his partner, John Abbott, looking at Maclaine in the dance hall/bar she works at. She is important for some reason tied to her face. Soon after hiring her, they show her a file on the life of Shabandar (Lom) the world's richest man living in a country like Indonesia or Malaysia. He is a lonely man, ever since his one beloved wife died some twenty five years before - and she resembled Maclaine. They head for the city that Shabandar lives in, planning to check into the hotel that is his home and headquarters, as aristocrats. They know his secret police will bring Maclaine's appearance to Lom's attention. He is fascinated by her, and takes her out to dinner, while Caine explains he has to await for some phone calls. You see him doing some robbery in Lom's apartment (which is electronically protected - but he is able to handle that), to get at a rare ancient bust of a princess (which looks like the late Mrs. Shabandar and Maclaine). At a given timed moment, she excuses herself to go to the powder room, leaving her bag behind to allay suspicion, but gets a cab, which picks up Caine at the hotel, and takes them to the airport where they leave for London.And that half hour gives the whole scheme. As Caine explains it to Abbott it is perfect. Not a seam in it.Soon the seams begin to be shown here.First off, Caine imagines Maclaine is putty in his hand, doing what he wants without any questions. From the start she is nothing but asking questions. This drives him crazy, like when she questions whether Lom can be the richest man in the world or not (Caine shouts back, in desperation, "OKAY, HE'S NOT THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD...HE'S THE FIFTH OR THE FOURTEENTH! WHAT THE HELL DOES IT MATTER!!") It still would not be totally off-centered if Caine, in his research, had been more careful. Lom (as typical for Herbert Lom) is an exceptionally smart guy - and very modern. He later explains to a bemused Caine that years before he allowed his inner sanctum to be invaded by a reporter and photographer, and had dressed up like a religious Mohammadan, but that was just window dressing. Since Caine has based his scheme on the information from that same article, one can imagine his feelings.Even Abbott, who plays a small part in the robbery plans, has problems. He is supposed to call Caine "to tell him that he has to call back that night", to give added details for the sake of a naturally suspicious Lom. But instead of using a specific pay phone as planned, Abbott can't even get into the phone booth because of a belligerent local man who is angrily making a telephone call.As you can see from these examples, the second movie (the eighty minutes following the opening) is like a guide book to why planning can only be a failure. It is a welcome antidote to the idiotic flawless plans that are at the center of the other films. And the three leads (four with Abbott) are enjoying the joke. The film is not will the plan be a success, but will it succeed despite the flaws that nobody even thought could arise.Only in the Sinatra OCEAN'S ELEVEN was there a similar sense of fun - as the Rat Pack realizes the inanity of the film plot (there robbing the Vegas casinos on one night) with the lights of Dino, Sammy, Frank, Joey, and the others working with precision when they'd prefer being drunk. Here Caine and Maclaine try to keep to an impossible time table and scheme after realizing they are not dealing with a tradition bound millionaire but one who fully likes using anti-burglary devices based on modern electronics. Yet they do manage to get done in time, for the double (possibly triple) surprise at the conclusions of the movie.An absolute joy (particularly seeing Lom being really pleasant for most of the film - except for one moment, but it passes quite quickly). It certainly deserves the kudos it has received as a first rate adventure comedy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fans of caper films and stylish heist yarns should be pleased with this well-appointed entry. Caine plays a shifty Englishman who recruits a jaded Eurasian dance-hall girl (MacLaine) to aid him in his latest plot. Due to her resemblance to the dead wife of the richest man in the world (Lom), he plans to use her to gain entry to the man's heavily guarded suite where he can map out a way to pilfer a priceless piece of sculpture. He intends to gussy MacLaine up in the appropriate hairstyle, clothing and manner of the dead woman, knowing that Lom will be fascinated enough by her to let his guard down. To reveal more would rob first-time viewers of some of the twistier elements of the script. A significant twist occurs about a quarter of the way in and it isn't the last one. The story begins one way and then takes off on a different tangent, giving the audience a chance to amply discover that the best laid plans don't always turn out they way they're intended to! Caine was just emerging as a major name in the cinema and gives a low-key, but assured performance here. His stern, understated persona is a terrific counterpoint to the more animated MacLaine (she hand-picked him for this role.) MacLaine is given a considerable showcase which allows her to display her range. She plays both a demure, silent, deliberately mechanical type and a chatty, animated, opinionated person. She also gets to show off her incredibly limber physique in one climactic scene. Lom is excellent, conveying a sure authority and a suave, aristocratic presence. Though the film is chiefly a three character showcase, all the other roles are portrayed by talented character actors. One small role is played by Tayback, who would later make a splash as the loud-mouthed short-order cook on TV's "Alice". The film is visually arresting, thanks to excellent set design, art direction and some eye-catching Jean Louis costumes. It's glossy, tasteful, old-fashioned entertainment featuring two charismatic stars. Caine and MacLaine would pair up again the next year in "Woman Times Seven" and be reunited almost 40 years later in "Bewitched".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first 20 or so minutes of "Gambit" are among the strangest and most unusual I can recall having seen. Harry (Michael Caine) discovers a dancer, Nicole (Shirley MacLaine) in a cheap cabaret. You then see him offer her a job and they then go off on a caper to rob the richest man in the world, Shahbandar (Herbert Lom). The plan goes off like clockwork and the theft has worked perfectly. It is only then that you realize that most of what you see happening is what Harry is describing to his partner, Emile (John Abbott). Then, and only then, does Harry's plan actually unfold. However, in this real caper, so many of the details do NOT work out as Harry has planned--and his 'wife' (Nicole--posing as the Missus) is nothing like she is in the plan. In the plan, she's silent and mysterious--but in reality she's chatty but actually a whole lot smarter than Harry! What's next? See the film for yourself to find out--but be aware that there are lots and lots of twists and turns! "Gambit" is a very good film--I won't deny that. And, it's nice that it is a more humorous and lighthearted sort of caper film. However, and here is a problem, it's in a genre that is absolutely glutted with exceptional films. So, while "Gambit" is very good, films like "Rififi", "Grand Slam", "Big Deal on Madonna Street", "Bob le Flambeur" and many others make it seem to be second-tier. Good but not among the many better films like it. My biggest complaints was the bizarre casting of MacLaine as a Eurasian(why not have her play an American?!) as well as perhaps too many twists near the end for its own good. However, Shirley MacLaine and Herbert Lom are particularly good in the film. Worth your time but not a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Neame's "Gambit"(1966) stars Michael Caine as a criminal who concocts an elaborate scheme involving the theft of a priceless sculpture. The film was released several years prior to "The Italian Job"(1969), another heist movie starring Caine.Unusual for heist flicks, "Gambit's" entire first act is comprised of a fantasy sequence in which Caine's scheme flawlessly unfolds. Caine's idealizations are then mirrored to various male characters, who either idealize the past or pine longingly for actress Shirley MacLaine, who's forced to adopt a blank face, a canvas upon which men project their fantasies. Emblematic of deified women, and venerated artwork made in their image, Shirley eventually does something which shatters the fantasies of her admirers: she reveals a personality. The film's final act then sees various illusions and idealizations shattered, and then promptly built back up, Caine revealed to be "not quite a criminal" after all. Such thematic preoccupations make "Gambit" one of the more unusual heist movies of the 1960s.7.9/10 ? Worth one viewing. See Antonioni's "Beyond The Clouds".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fun '60s "caper" film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Caine and Shirley Maclaine star in "Gambit," a 1966 movie done in the style so popular in that era, the "caper" film. Inspired by the success and style of "Charade," the '60s brought us "How to Steal a Million," "Topkapi," "Rififi" et al. - sophisticated, glamorous, international, breezy fun. In "Gambit," Harry (Michael Caine) hires Nicole (Maclaine) to pose as his exotic wife so that he can get into the apartment of the richest man in the world, Shabhandar, played by Herbert Lom. "There's no such thing as the richest man in the world," Nicole complains. "It's like the highest star or - " "Okay, the second richest man in the world, the third richest!" Harry yells. Nicole is made up to resemble Shabhandar's late wife. The purpose: robbery.Without giving anything away, the beginning of the film is fabulous and draws the viewer in immediately. Caine is a riot as the gifted Harry, who finds that coping with Nicole is one part of the plan he hadn't counted on, and Maclaine is very funny as a performer who gets more involved in her assignment than she wanted to. Herbert Lom, as the first, second, whatever wealthiest man in the world, Shabhandar, is perfect portraying the urbane, suspicious, and calculating recluse.This isn't the top of the genre, but it's still very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gambit (1966)I love both Michael Caine and Shirley MacLaine, and yet I went into the movie with low expectations. Maybe this was partly the dull poster art (which is all I had to go on), or just the fact I had never heard of the movie (and I see a lot of movies from this era).And it was really good! Yes, a fun, snappy, somewhat contrived but still engaging piece of very 1960s entertainment. It begins with a narrative trick, which I can't reveal, but the first twenty minutes is a kind of set-up or reference point for the next hour. Once you see it happen, it's a big laugh, and they actors play it out well, though with a slight bit of camp. Caine plays a thief and con man, and MacLaine is just a willing and slightly naive participant. At first.We are supposed to believe, as well, that these two young charming people are not made for each other (they act disinterested), but the love story becomes a small part of the situation. The third main actor is Herbert Lom, who plays an Arab connected to oil (this is several years before the oil embargo, and more than a decade before the first big Islamic uprising, the one in Iran in 1979). He happens to be the richest man in the world. And a target for this British man looking for easy success.Easy it is, if only things were what they seemed at first. Brightly lit, photographed with verve and acted with a kind of wink to the camera, the movie is just good fun. This isn't a drama, it's a comedy, and it will brighten your day even if you have to ignore the forced twists in the plot. Michael Caine had just finished filming the astonishing "Alfie" which is both funny and truly dramatic, and he was proving to be a complex and yet still caddishly likable leading man, very British. Shirley MacLaine (an American) had been making charming funny movies for some time, playing the cute and vulnerable "girl" over and over (as in "The Apartment" best of all, but see "Irma la Douce" too, where she is a prostitute). Together here they are really well matched and hold up the movie start to finish. Remember to make it through the "set-up" part of the movie, which will at first seem a little stiff. It makes sense later!</fullReview>

The second half of the film is the actual heist taking place as they try to steal a priceless sculpture and things do not go according to plan but the film still has a few twists up its sleeve.MacLaine is miscast as a Eurasian, Lom is less of a villain but a man who is urbane as well as suspicious and knows early on that something is afoot.It is an enjoyable romp with a lightness of touch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicole Chang (Shirley MacLaine) is a Hong Kong nightclub dancer. Harry Dean (Michael Caine) hires her to do a job. He plans to rob the wealthy recluse Ahmad Shahbandar (Herbert Lom). His late wife resembled Nicole and with a makeover, she becomes an exact copy posing as Harry's wife.The movie starts with a long fake out. It does throw the movie off in a strange mood as essentially it redoes the first act. I actually love the real Nicole Chang. The relationship between her and Harry is much more complicated. I really don't like it at first but then the movie does the standard rom-com love-hate move. These two great actors almost sold me on this pairing but in the end, it's a little too hard. The caper has plenty of twists and it's pretty good. There are a couple of unusual elements in this movie that keeps me from truly loving it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like the other notable twist laden Michael Caine movie Sleuth, I can't say much about Gambit without spoiling it. During the first 25 minutes I was doubting if I was even going to enjoy the film. The characters appeared to be forgettable and two dimensional. Michael Caine outwits everyone, but in an uninteresting manner, Shirley MacLaine never speaks nor shows any emotion or vulnerability, while Herbert Lom plays an unimaginative caricature of a reclusive, eccentric millionaire. Like Sleuth, on first viewing I thought that film was making a mistake during a certain section; with Gambit I felt the same way about the first section of the movie.However when it is revealed these first 25 minutes are just the idealised scenario for a heist played out in Michael Caine's head, I had the biggest smile on my face and the reaction of "You clever bastards!". All of a sudden this seemingly boring film became fascinating with the scenario I had just seen played out now occurred with a welcome sense of realism and with interesting, flawed characters, with much of the humour stemming from the differences between fact and fiction. It reminded of that popular internet meme 'expectation/reality', and came off to me like a satire of sorts on unimaginative writing and characters. Watching the film a second time I can now spot the moment of foreshadowing when Michael Caine says to his accomplice, "Now pay close attention". Of course it wouldn't be a heist movie without suspense, and does the third act deliver, full of nail biting moments and clever solutions.Released in 1966, just prior to the rise of the New Hollywood movement, Gambit sees the final days of that distinctive old Hollywood glamour. Gambit is a very exotic movie at that, with Shirley MacLaine being presented in the image of a goddess throughout, and even her more common looking attire during the heist at the end is exceedingly stylish. Plus who can look more dapper as a cat burglar than Michael Caine? The back and forth between Caine and MacLaine is pure heaven. There are few other actresses with as playful an on screen persona as Shirley MacLaine, while Caine gets annoyed by her giddy, child like attitude. I don't care how many films I see which contain the "the hate each other but secretly love each other" dynamic, as long as it's between a screen pairing with superb chemistry then I'll never tire of seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take the Gamble on Gambit ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shirley MacLaine teams with Michael Caine in this fast paced thriller where a guy seeks the aid of a female to steal a famous sculpture from the world's richest man.The first 20 minutes of the film is devoted to the perfect execution of the caper with MacLaine not uttering one word.Then reality sets in and there are problems along the way, including that MacLaine is far from a subservient accessory to this intended crime.Herbert Lom is the wealthiest man who seems to turn the tables on Caine.The real diabolical part of the scheme is revealed at the film's end, but love shall conquer all including the scheming Caine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Corkscrew Caper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A corkscrew picture with so many twists and turns you may need to take notes. I love the screenplay idea that first shows how the theft is supposed to go, and then shows how it really goes. Very imaginative and a perfect set-up for comedy. As it is, the movie's a rather light- hearted caper film where everybody outwits everybody else, but no one really gets hurt.Caine's perfect as the conniving English gentleman. Besides no one wears upscale suits as well as he. MacLaine too is a dazzler in her many gowns; let's just hope they weren't paying her by the word. Note how athletic she is, a skill from her days as a dancer, I suppose. It's sort of good to see the scary Herbert Lom as the Big Cheese rich guy. I'm troubled, however, because his commanding presence always makes me bolt from the chair and stand at attention.Anyway, there are echoes here from 1964's Topkapi, but this one's more plot heavy. Then too, I can't decide whether that very last twist is just one too many or a perfect way to end a corkscrew film. All in all, it's an imaginative heist movie at a time when there were lots, but this one's as good as any. Besides, I nominate Caine and MacLaine as the eye-catching couple of the decade, or maybe longer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Entertaining Crime Caper.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very enjoyable and entertaining crime caper. Harry is a burglar(played by Michael Caine) who recruits Nicole (Shirley MacLaine)a dancer to help him rob tycoon Mr.Shahbandar. Apparently Harry has devised a foolproof scheme to rob the tycoon. The reason he employs Nicole is that she is a dead ringer for Mr.Shahbandar's late wife. The couple meet Mr. Shabandar and the robbery is then carried out to perfection. Or is it?? Watch it and see for yourself. I think you will really enjoy this charming entertaining movie which was one of Michael Caine's early films.The three main stars Caine, MacClaine and Lom are all perfect in their parts. Another trip back to the 1960's - oh how I wish that I had a time machine!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fluff, but fun fluff...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Highly enjoyable mid-sixties fluff. A well-teamed Michael Caine and Shirley MacLaine play a thief and his not so willing cohort. Caine attempts to steal a priceless statue from the world's wealthiest man (Herbert Lom) and pays MacLaine to help him. Things do NOT go as Caine plans. Lom, looking very tanned, is on to him immediately and MacLaine gives him more trouble than he expected. Directed by Ronald Neame, the film is a fun, cleverly scripted caper. Caine and MacLaine have terrific chemistry and Lom, usually playing high strung characters, is very good in a rare low-key performance. The swinging music score is by Maurice Jarre and Clifford Stine was responsible for the (very colorful) photography.</fullReview>
