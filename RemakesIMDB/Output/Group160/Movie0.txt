		<shortDescription>Quite good really</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film on release night with my fiancée. We had previously seen a couple of trailers for the film and thought it looked funny and interesting, although on the day I was disturbed to see find such a low rating here on IMDb.*Disclosure, I am not connected to the film's production or any of the cast, and have no agenda here other than offering an alternative point of view.The basic plot is already known in advance: that Colin Firth wants to con his evil boss using a beautiful Texan as bait. He travels to meet her accompanied by his friend and co-conman, Major Wingate. After watching her in a rodeo they go to a local bar to make the approach. The Major asks Colin how much is he going to tell her? He answers: "Oh, only enough for her to play her part". And the same is true of the audience. You are only told enough to a) identify with Colin's character and his motivation, and b) follow the plot to come.We're then treated to a brief 'Ocean's 11-style' précis of how Colin imagines the con will play out from start to finish. Needless to say, no plan ever works out exactly as imagined!The humour is very dry, never in-your-face, and this isn't the kind of film to hand you gags. Laughing our loud isn't the point. Instead there's a mixture of situational comedy, miss-understanding comedy, wordplay, and great interaction between the characters. Some of the best jokes are the ones where you have to smile ruefully when things go wrong on a bad day. I thought at the time that the screen-writing was a lot like Richard Curtis, and could easily imagine Rowan Atkinson as the lead. Instead the best joke is Colin Firth himself, playing a little man, in Cameron Diaz's words, instead of a larger-than-life character for a change; playing it straight, rarely smiling because he's not very happy (he wants revenge, remember) and not trying to seduce the very comely Cameron Diaz, who also plays a wickedly funny character without being cast as the comic side-kick.But, from a critics point of view, I guess, there's not much originality. You can perceive homages to other films; old Ealing- comedies like the Ladykillers, where the subject matter isn't funny but there is some great humour. And I'm not referring to the re-make, which I didn't like.I'd like to watch this film again at a later time and see if I can. It might grow on me and become a minor classic, or it might drop to mediocre. Either way, if you watch it you have to appreciate it for what it is, rather than what it isn't. And it probably helps if you have a temperament where you can see the funny side in unfunny situations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved it!! What are people on about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am surprised at the bad reviews. I thought the film was hilarious. Obviously people's sense humour is not the same but come on.. Give them some credit! it's no where near as rubbish as some of the reviewers are making it to be. This film made me laugh properly and I found it entertaining and engaging from from A to Z. I haven't seen any older version to compare but I don't care I think this film was money well spent. I loved the cast especially Colin! Sometimes just looking at his facial expressions in some scenes was funny. Directing was great too not to mention the script. I can't claim that I am an expert film critics but I felt I had to write a review after reading so many negative ones which I think is quite unfair for a film that had so many laugh out loud moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't think this film deserves the poor reviews it has received! I have never seen the original so am not comparing this, simply judging it as a film in its own right. The cast is brilliant, I love Diaz, Firth, Rickman and Tucci so was never going to be disappointed! Yes it's a ridiculous caper movie, it's not meant to be taken seriously on any level! It's great fun, I was weeping with laughter at some of the hotel scenes, and that doesn't happen often in a movie! I'm not quite sure what some of the reviewers on this site were expecting, but I was thoroughly entertained! I came out with a smile on my face so in my books that's just fine!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent traditional comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gambit, a revisitation of a swinging 60s caper movie starring Michael Caine and Shirley Maclaine, features Colin Firth as a hapless art expert who, with the aid of sexy Texan rodeo girl Cameron Diaz, plans to swindle obnoxious squillionaire Alan Rickman with the aid of a fake Monet painted by art forger Tom Courtenay.This is fairly broad and obvious stuff. It has come in for a moderate amount of criticism, yet much of this is unfair: it is frequently genuinely funny (though not screamingly so), although the funniest moment, by far, is a fart gag. The knockabout side of the humour is comical and Firth is amiable enough, but Diaz overplays (not that she is given the opportunity to do anything else).Perhaps criticism derives from the fact that writers the Coen brothers are supposed to be edgy and trendy, and this is actually pretty traditional stuff. Maybe so, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating: it may not appeal to those who love the Coens as auteurs, nor to the fans of toilet, sex and profanity filled youth comedies, but it greatly pleased a cinema populated by English couples in their middle years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why pick this for a remake?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Colin Firth obviously wanted a less taxing role after stammering as King George VI. In this remake of a Sixties Michael Caine comic 'caper' he plays a disgruntled art dealer who decides to trick his unpleasant billionaire boss into buying a fake Monet. Shirley MacLaine's Hong Kong dancer roped in as co-conspirator and candy-floss in the 1966 version has became a Texas rodeo queen - Cameron Diaz doing her best with a one-dimensional part. Alan Rickman does an appropriately pantomime turn as the monstrously egotistical tycoon and gets some of the movie's most embarrassing scenes, but he seems to be having fun. Colin Firth makes a visible effort to enjoy losing his pants on a ledge outside the Savoy Hotel, but the role would have perhaps been easier for Hugh Grant. Stanley Tucci plays a German art expert who may (or may not) be inspired by Albert Schweitzer. The London scenes are livelier than the scenes at Rickman's Downtonesque country house, though a farting dowager moment targets a younger audience than this is likely to pull in.This piece of fluff comes from the Coen brothers who usually apply themselves to something zanier and zingier. If they wanted to revamp a comedy heist movie, why didn't they take on Peter Ustinov's all-star Istanbul romp TOPKAPI (1964) or, if they wanted to keep the budget down, Warren Beatty's KALEIDOSCOPE, also from 1966, which had more pace and plot than the original GAMBIT but not such deft performances? It's really only the actors who raise this year's GAMBIT from being potentially dire into something that is merely mediocre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightful lighthearted comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about an art curator who decides to seek revenge on his horrible boss by tricking him to buy a fake Monet painting."Gambit" is a delightful lighthearted comedy about a heist that deviates from the plan. The original plan that Harry had was displayed in the beginning ten minutes of the film, then the rest of the run time is about how things do not go according to plan. Actually everything goes wrong and the situation becomes so hilarious. Colin Firth is great as a frustrated and disgruntled art curator, while Cameron Diaz is charming with her distinctive accent. She makes her character so interesting, her mischievous simplicity is a sharp contrast to how she gets things done in a well controlled manner. The ending twists are well executed, making it a truly Coen script. I find "Gambit" funny and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully enjoyable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very entertaining, witty and well acted comedy heist! With an all star cast including Colin Firth, Cameron Diaz and Alan Rickman. Cameron Diaz in particular plays the part of the charming, brassy Texan rodeo queen superbly and shines in every scene.I spent more than half the film laughing and the rest intrigued. It has enough plot development to keep you guessing and interested until the end and enough depth and development of the characters to be believable and touching. In addition to this the sets and costumes are sumptuous and really add to the entertainment value of the film in a surprising way.There is a lovely cameo part from the red haired chap from Green Wing as an employee at the savoy hotel who keeps catching Firth in a series of embarrassing situations during one evening. It will never be 'The Shawshank Redemption' in terms of critics' approval but I don't think it is trying to be - if you want a smart, entertaining, funny film to watch you won't be disappointed with this. I would watch it again which is always a good barometer of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Colin's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was prepared to like this film as I'd seen the original Gambit. This film however, had a completely different story line. Colin Firth does his best with it and there are a couple of smiley moments, especially when he loses his trousers climbing round a hotel ledge but it is not enough. The film is very short, and when it ends you wonder what possessed the Coen Brothers to make it. Cameron Diaz is extremely irritating and the character goes nowhere. Tom Courtenay was wasted in his role and some of the so called funny situations are too contrived ie when they book into the London hotel. The twists in the tale aren't twists at all, just cop outs. It just seems a pointless film and is not clever or funny enough. Colin Firth is a brilliant actor but sometimes his lightweight film choices are very strange. A disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to a mall to see what movies the have, and was very bored about those really really bad films i saw from the end of 20012 to the beginning of 2013 ( especially The movies nominated for the Oscar or got praised by critics ) all of them were bad such as Django Unchained (2012) which was by the way a nightmare ,Killing Them Softly (2012) you can call it a disaster and Skyfall (2012) was just a commercial film for the watch ,the sunglasses and of course the car,and Taken 2 (2012)!!!(no comment for this one0.Gambit is what i called a SWEET MOVIE give u both pleasure and fun which by the way a good thing when you're sad. again its not a great but its nice one such as (The Hottie &amp; the Nottie 2008) and its even better.I just loved all the main characters, especially Cameron Diaz she played the role of a taxes woman working at the rodeo very well and her accent was very good you have to watch the film just to saw her acting ability.Colin Firth was OK, not at his top as (Bridget Jones's Diary ) but he has his nice moments which by the way were very funny.Alan Rickman was at his top playing the snob Lionel Shahbandar in a very impressive way.I loved very much the beginning of the film when you see the names of the players with a cartoon of each on of them telling you the story in some way but without destroying the story or the events.It is a bout how to steel but in a very different way cause the huge problem is that the leader cant lead anyone even himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's NOT you typical Coen Brother Production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Webster's defines a gambit as a chess opening in which a player risks one of his pawns or a minor piece in order to gain an advantage of securing a larger more valuable piece or position. This British import re-make of the 1966 Michael Caine / Shirley MacLaine comedy caper is devilishly delightful and features the ensemble cast of Colin Firth, Cameron Diaz and Alan Rickman. Written by the Coen brothers Joel and Ethan, this films lacks the laugh out loud comedic antics that you have come to expect with a typical Coen Brothers production; however, this film is an engaging movie to sit through and effortlessly hits all the sweet spots that a heist comedy should hit.Colin Firth (The King's Speech) plays Harry Deane, an art curator working for Lionel Shahbandar (Alan Rickman), a maniacal businessman who possesses little or no concern to the employees that work for him. Deane, who despises his boss, devises an elaborate scheme to swindle his boss using Shahbandar's biggest weakness, his fondness of art, more specifically Monet artwork. Shahbandar paid $11 Million Pounds (British Sterling) for Monet's 'Haystacks at Dawn'. Deane hopes to entice his boss into buying a forged Monet's 'Haystacks at Dusk' replica companion piece for $12 Million Pounds (British Sterling) in which Deane will authenticate as the real genuine article.Prior to putting this genius plan into action, Deane shares his complex connivery with the audience in a dream sequence of how exactly this diabolical plan of action would/should fall into place. In order for this whole plan to work, Deane needs to secure the services of one more very essential person to his plot, P.J. Puznowski (Cameron Diaz). It seems that PJ is the great, granddaughter, of SGT Puznowski, who lead the raid on the Nazi stronghold of European stolen artwork which so happen to include, Monet's 'Haystacks at Dusk'. Deane is adamant that if Shahbandar is so obsessed and blind to Monet's artwork that he will do or pay any amount of money to complete his collection. However, nothing seems go as Henry Deane planned, it's a total debacle from the beginning.The true star of this film is Alan Rickman!!! He's funny, arrogant, chauvinistic, evil, belittling, in other words, MAGNIFICENT!!! He steals every scene that he is in. Seriously underestimated by Deane (Firth), Shahbandar (Rickman) is a cut-throat businessman; Rickman (doing his best Alan Sugar, British magnate, impersonation) isn't as eagerly venerable to the dangling bait Deane has to offer.A very cute movie nonetheless; I am actually now very interested in seeing the Michael Caine / Shirley MacLaine 1966 original. This film is definitely worth seeking out on DVD, Cable, or On Demand. Again this is not your typical Coen Brother's slapstick, in-your-face comedy, but instead a more adult refined sort of comedy. British in nature; however, be warned that some of the disturbing images of Alan Rickman from this film may resonate in your memories for a long time to come.See more of my reviews on FB @ "The Faris Reel"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Funny Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very funny movie. I saw the movie in Berlin with a mostly German audience. The laughter started slowly and then built to a continual roll. Colin Firth is such a good actor who can do both drama and comedy. My favorite comic bit in the movie is his wandering around the hotel in his boxer briefs, jacket and tie, a comic routine reminiscent of some of the great screwball scenes in movies like Bringing Up Baby and The Awful Truth. Alan Rickman gives a great performance once again acting with his mouth. Cameron Diaz who is usually over the top obnoxious in movies brings a touching tenderness to what could have been a brash and obnoxious character. I am not sure how to describe this comedy. It is neither farce nor slapstick but has elements of both. What it is is a funny, sly and witty comedy without any over the top situations, car crashes or violent scenes. I hope it makes it to the States so I can see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(36%) An enormously average crime caper from the hands of people who we know can do much better. The cast was there, so were the writers, and the director isn't exactly a first timer. So what went wrong? First of all all the characters are HUGE stereotypes, and I do know that this is based around a film from an era in which that type of attitude was common and largely excepted, but this couldn't pigeon-hole its cast list even if it tried. Which I thick it probably did. Cameron Diaz plays essentially Daisy Duke crossed with Toy story's Jessie because she's from Texas where everyone wears a Stetson and eats T.bones all day while firing a pistol in the air. Colin Firth (best aspect of the film) and Alan Rickman on the other hand are as English as a rain soaked summer bank holiday. While the least said about the Japanese characters the better. This really isn't "Lay the favourite" bad, but you'd need to be very easily pleased to get anything from this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightfully funny and full of one liners!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure why it got so many low ratings. It's one of those movies I've passed over many times, despite my love for Colin Firth, because reviews were so low. Finally, Redbox sold out of anything better, I gave it a try and now I'm so glad I did.If you're looking for Oceans 11 or The Italian Job type intricacies in the plot, it isn't going to happen. However, it's still cute and interesting with enough of a twist to be worth it. Where this show really shines is in the hilarious writing - the insults and comments are really really funny - and in the acting abilities of Colin Firth and Alan Rickman. Both do tremendous jobs. Colin Firth can take impossibly stupid situations, the kind Steve Martin and Ben Stiller do, situations almost painful in how absurd and moronic they are, and yet he makes them hilarious. A guy on a hotel ledge several stories up, no pants, is old old old, but Colin Firth makes it remarkably entertaining, as if this is the first time you've ever seen that scenario in a movie. Alan Rickman plays a SOB like no one else and he's the total jerk you love anyway (think his Sheriff of Nottingham role) because he's just so good at it and his muttered comments and blatant insults keep you busting out in laughs. I got to the point I was jotting down some of the lines in the show, and thinking I may need to go back to the beginning to write down others, because they're absurd, clever, and all-together brilliant.If you need lots of intricate plot twists and details - maybe not for you. If you enjoy understated yet remarkably hilarious verbal humor, witty comeback, diverting insult and repartee, ridiculous colloquialisms and a few side-splitting guffaws, this is the show for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art Scam Flick Rings Hollow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing with all the talent associated with this remake of the 1966 art scam movie, that it could ring so hollow, providing some laughs but the preponderance of humor, in my opinion, fell flat as a pancake. The movie has an all-star cast, is written by the great Coen Brothers, and is directed by Michael Hoffman (Soapdish, The Last Station). To me, the film just seemed to waste so much of this talent and just never came together as a consistently enjoyable movie.Colin Firth stars as Harry Deane, a straight-laced British curator, overseeing the private art collection of media mogul Lionel Shahbandar. Alan Rickman believably portrays the vile and obnoxious Lionel, and Harry begins to devise a plan of revenge against Lionel that will bilk him out of millions of dollars.He will need the help of his friend and cohort Major Wingate, who's an accomplished art forger, and is played by a barely recognizable Tom Cortenay. He'll also need the help of one PJ Puznowski, who's a worker in a poultry processing plant in Texas, and a part-time rodeo roper. Cameron Diaz handles the role of the free spirit PJ, whose grandfather, as an American GI in WW2, may have absconded with a highly valuable Monet painting, when his unit raided the stolen art collection of Nazi Hermann Goering.'However, when Harry and the Major bring PJ to London to try and complete the scam, things, of course don't quite go according to plan. It all will culminate in a couple of plot twists near the end of the movie that were fairly well conceived.I wasn't expecting much from this film after reading the reviews, so I can't say I was disappointed. It had its' moments with some clever and humorous scenes but overall, for whatever reason, the bulk of the film just rang hollow and flat.</fullReview>

Cameron played her part well, given the genre and her comedic timing as usual was spot on However, she was bound up by a lack lustre script. The only other 'high light' in this very low mood lit film was the Japanese media representative Do yourself a favour, go for a penny farthing bike ride in 45C heat or organise a flash mob in North Korea.

		<shortDescription>To promote or not to promote</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From what I've heard, the distributors had a tough time deciding on how far to go in promoting this movie. Its being and Coen Brothers film seem to call for corresponding promotion effort to reap such benefits. On the other hand, they know (and they realize that the audiences will eventually know) that this is not exactly the auteur's best offering. In seems that expectation management won, and it makes good sense. Free of the expectation normally attached to a Coen Brothers' movie, "Gambit" is a delightful little diversion from the banal daily existence that a lot of us are unfortunately stuck with.In wisely contained 90 minutes, "Gambit" offers a simple heist plot that culminates in a small twist that is just about right. The laughs come in a good variety of quality, from wit to farce. Playing an arts expert, Colin Firth's British wit is a joy to watch and he even undertakes a bit of pure visual humour in the glorious tradition of Peter Sellers, in a series of scenes involving trying to find a place to sit down in the boss's office. Said boss is played by Alan Rickman who takes a different route to comedy, exaggeration and farce, in a nutshell. Cowgirl personifies Cameron Diaz's Southern accent is quite delightful, especially in snobbish London. Stanley Tucci's German accent is equally endearing as he plays a rival art expert.Just to reiterate, this is not among the Coen Brother's better work but for a short 90-minute entertainment, the time is well spent.</fullReview>

And was really annoyed by the fact nothing funny happened yet after 30 minutes. Or was I supposed to laugh at the scene where Deane messes up with the chairs? Did I have to laugh at his naked boss? Or was Cameron's accent supposed to make me laugh. It didn't even manage to make my mouth corners go up a inch.The only moments that I thought were funny were every time the hosts see Deane making a fool out of himself.Anyway.. horrible movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know that relaxing movie that you wanna play sometimes, but you're ashamed to, you know what I mean... That mix of comedy, somewhat intelligent humor and a good cast to top it all off, but not too romantic, modern or lame... Well, these are the gambits you are looking for (actually gambit, but then I couldn't make that Star Wars reference showing you that, I too, have watched the trilogy at some point (oh wait, is that another remark about Star Wars, now showing that I don't acknowledge the last three parts(oh snap, we got some Inception stuff right here...))). Anywhoo, Gambit is a cleverly written light comedy with an excellent cast, each character seems to be specifically written for that actor, although this movie could have been starring a completely different cast: Hugh Grant, Sandra Bullock, and Ben Kingsley.Lionel Shahbandar, a media mogul and a lord has one more title to his name, a horrible boss. Especially to his curator Harry Deane (Colin Firth, long live the king) who looks after his art collection, a simple fellow with good manners and a big heart, but really depressed because of the fact he has to be humiliated on a daily basis by his pompous boss. Harry and his good friend Major, devise a plan to stick it to the man, well in this case, Lord Shahbandar, magnificently played by the almighty Alan Rickman. This complicated and yet simple scheme involves a third person that could not be farther from the business and art world, miss PJ Puznowski (Cameron Diaz). PJ is a country girl from Texas, that enjoy cattle rustling and plucking chickens, so a plan that will make her rich very quickly sounds very good to her. But, as in all good plans, things don't go quite well as you would expect them to...Written by the Coen brothers who brought you many legendary movies, Gambit is good for one watching and perhaps a second, when you accidentally catch it on cable. Still, I liked how the romance was shifted out of the focus, and the clumsiness of our dear fellow Harry brought into the spotlight. In the scenes which take place in a hotel, he reminded me very much of a timeless performance by Peter Sellers in the movie The Party (1968). Other than that, I think that this sums up my thoughts about this movie, enjoy...Movie recommendations Rabbit-Reviews.com - Only movies worth watching</fullReview>

The time you spend watching this film you can never have back, my only recommendation would be not to start watching it, and if you have already started to do so then stop immediately. Dull, dull, dull Stereotypical characters, staid 'jokes' and a predicable story.

Firth and Courtney were great together. Diaz and Firth had great chemistry. Stanley Tucci and Alan Rickman were weak links, but it was the script, not the actors. Firth was a good sport being put into humorous humiliating situations that evoke Lucille Ball in I love Lucy. The direction by Michael Hoffman could have been better. Nonetheless Firth, Courtney and Diaz made up for those deficiencies. I say See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy at the Hands of the Cohen Brothers Not a Good Gambit and End's Up in Sturgeon's 90%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sturgeon's Law (paraphrased) states "90% of fiction, music, art and films is of low quality". The Cohen Brothers have a pretty good track record with more than 50% of their offerings residing in the elite 10% of "good material". However, when good filmmakers miss the strike zone, they tend to hit the batter. In this case, the batter is the audience, and the Cohen brothers, despite good intentions, pitched one right at the head missing the strike zone by a mile. "Gambit" is a good idea with a good cast wasted on a poorly written script. The "funny parts" weren't funny, and I couldn't take the serious parts seriously.The central premise, decent but needed a lot more rewrites, involves the hustling of a billionaire magnate out of millions by selling him a fake painting. Harry Deane (Colin Firth) is a disgruntled employee seeking to outwit his vain employer, billionaire Lord Lionel Shabandar (Alan Rickman). Lord Lionel has a weakness for Monet paintings, particularly the ones featuring haystacks. Deane solicits the help of The Major (Tom Courtenay) who can replicate paintings by the best modern masters. Before the events of the story, we learn the Major has faked a Monet. Now they need a hook to entice their prey.They find a pretty young woman, PJ Puznowski (Cameron Diaz), a cowgirl rodeo enthusiast in Texas, and create a narrative in which her family has supposedly owned a real Monet for many years. Deane and the Major find her at a bar in Texas, and she agrees to engage in the deception for a fee of ?500,000, or about $800,000 US. For the con to work, they take a picture of PJ and her mother sitting on an old 1970's couch in a caravan/mobile home which is then published in a rodeo magazine, which happens to be one of Lord Lionel's many publications. There's a short sequence in which Deane and the Major imagine how the con will play out successfully before they return the current "time" in which they need to convince PJ.She agrees, and then Deane shows the magazine photo to Lord Lionel who believes the painting only to be a replica because of its residing in a mobile home (called a "caravan" in British English) in Texas. Deane convinces him they should at least explore the possibility the painting is real, and they fly PJ to London. PJ meets Lionel, but rather to Deane's horror, PJ takes a liking to Lord Lionel and begins having doubts about engaging in the deception. Back at his flat, Deane keeps getting punched out by his neighbor. Is this supposed to be funny? Also, we learn Deane is nearly tapped out, being forced to pay extravagant prices for PJ's accommodations at the Savoy Hotel in London, one of the most expensive in Europe.Lord Lionel then asks PJ on a dinner date at a Japanese Restaurant where they meet the Kon'nichiwa Media Club who are there to interpret Japanese for the English-speaking guests. Up until now, some of the humor was barely tolerable and I wanted the story to get on track about the con. However, the Cohen Brothers opted for nearly-offensive stereotyping of Japanese people I guess for cheap laughs. Then Deane finds a priceless vase in the hallway of the hotel and tries to pilfer it by risking his life on the hotel ledge. Couldn't he have just stuffed it into a suitcase? I found the rest of the film going from hard-to-watch to nearly-insufferable.You have to credit the three leads for doing the best they could with a mediocre script. Rickman makes an excellent multi-zillionaire as PJ calls him, Firth a good straight-man to Diaz and Rickman, and Diaz as the clueless southern American who knows nothing about British/European culture. Unfortunately, there were too many over-the-top moments which I guess were designed to be funny but more in the "you can't be serious" department. Deane literally losing his pants to steal the vase was one of many. Also, I wasn't quite buying that Deane was "tapped out". I was expecting something at the beginning, maybe a sequence with him and Rickman in which he's denied a raise or similar denial for loyal service. Unfortunately, the Cohen brothers missed the strike zone on this one and ended up in Sturgeon's 90%. What a bummer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Cast, but the Humour is Lame and Immature,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gambit is a very poor film with a simple story that is in no way special and a great cast that sadly couldn't save this mess. It had a promising set up and with a cast like Colin Firth, Cameron Diaz and Alan Rickman, it seemed like it could have been a very fun comedy caper, but sadly it did not come close, there's no real element of adventure in it because of just how straight forward the whole story was, we never feel in danger. I am a big fan of the three main actors but they just could not do anything to save this, Colin Firth's characterisation for Harry was great, he clearly put a lot of work in to this role, but sadly he is unlikeable, it's difficult to support him. As for Diaz and Rickman, their characters were simply irritating, with an uneducated supporting female and a villain who is in no way menacing. As a comedy, it's simply not funny, using nudity and sexual innuendos as its main source for laughter, it's very immature for a British comedy, which you would normally expect to be more sophisticated and subtle. Despite an impressive cast, Gambit loses any potential it had with lame comedy and unlikeable characters, I would not recommend it. An art curator wants to seek revenge on his boss, so he hatches a plan in to conning him to buy a fake Monet. Best Performance: Colin Firth</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My opening gambit on Gambit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gambit is one of those films where you look at the cast list and feel you should like it a lot more than you actually do. I mean you have Colin Firth (fresh from The Kings Speech at the time) Cameron Diaz and the dearly missed Alan Rickman. Where can you go wrong? The answer is by creating a mildly amusing (and sometimes very amusing) sort of Pink Panther-esque farce that at some points tries to be too adult and then at other moments too sentimental. As for Diaz's accent, well you'll either love it or hate it.There are some lovely moments of farce but they are bookended by dull moments and too much plotting and not enough doing. The eventual con is carried out in moments, leaving you thinking what was the point of the rest of it. And it's only a very short film to start with.Alan Rickman though shines in his role. Firth and Diaz run around like headless chickens and he exudes more of a laugh from the audience just by raising an eyebrow. A legend.Overall this is a good example of top stars doing their best with a weak script (by the Coen Brothers no less).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched the film and then out of curiosity went onto IMDb to find such a low rating! I am a bit of Colin Firth fan. I loved how Firth's costume was a suit and the humour was very subtle and indeed very British - it did remind me a bit of his role in Kingsman. The film also cheered me up after having a bad day. I'd recommend it to everyone who likes to be amused without the need to laugh out loud or listen to loud and obvious jokes.The plot was indeed not the most unique. Although it wasn't until he was holding the painting until it clicked for me of how obvious it actually was. However, the casting in this film is great!Having a cowgirl from Texas along side what one might call proper British gentlemen was hilarious!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry is an expert in art and he also wants to get back to his boss for mal treating him. So he hires an American woman to pretend that she owns a lost painting. On paper the movie had everything one movie needs in order to be successful, funny and entertaining. However, apart from some sparks of brilliant humour, the movie was dreadfully. First of all, the pace was so messed up, that one time we are speeding up, the next we are stuck into a boring scene for more than ten minutes. Then, it was the music and the whole atmosphere that can be only compared to the old movies, but not as much for the quality. The acting wasn't good, the story wasn't presented as it should be, in other words it was boring, up until the last three minutes when it finally got interesting. So 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this a satire or an unnecessary"homage"to 60s comedy?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sort of crime/comedy capers that starred big names in psychedelic colours and absolutely up to the minute fashions quickly palled only to be briefly resuscitated by Mr P.Bogdanovich in the sublime "What's up,Doc?"which also echoed much earlier works by the great Hollywood directors. Unfortunately,the evidence here is that the Coen Bros do not have the grasp of this broad humour in contrast to their recognised skill with "funny" that sometimes isn't "funny" at all but instead rather "disturbing". So "Gambit" is either a painfully unfunny satire or a wildly over- acted and painfully unfunny "hommage" to the briefly popular international super - productions loaded with stars that scarcely had us rolling in the aisles forty years ago and the survivors of which genre make for embarrassing viewing today. And so it is with this woeful production featuring some very hammy performances by big - name actors who mug desperately and try to look as if it was all terrific fun on the off- chance that such enjoyment might be infectious. Unfortunately for them it isn't. Mr A.Rickman is particularly guilty in this respect,making his Sheriff of Nottingham seem like a masterclass in restraint. Messrs Firth and Courtenay are like the Cannon and Ball of the 21st century. Miss C.Diaz wears a fixed grin like a politician kissing his 20th baby of the day. It is loud,boorish and tedious. Presumably the remuneration was in direct disproportion to the artistic effort displayed. A blip,one hopes,on the Coen's splendid C.V. that hopefully will neither be held against them nor repeated. I urge you not to waste your time on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of the 1966 film of the same name, 'Gambit' is a fair comedy, that offers some decent laughs in its short &amp; sweet running-time of 88-minutes. Keep your expectations in check, and have some fun! 'Gambit' Synopsis: An art curator decides to seek revenge on his abusive boss by conning him into buying a fake Monet, but his plan requires the help of an eccentric and unpredictable Texas rodeo queen.'Gambit' isn't laugh-out-loud funny, which it definitely should've been. Nevertheless, the film has a consistent pace &amp; some of the jokes involving the protagonist's series of unfortunate events, tickle your funny bone. Joel &amp; Ethan Coen's Screenplay is fair, but it needed more humor, for sure. Michael Hoffman's Direction is royal. Cinematography &amp; Editing are pitch-perfect. Performance-Wise: Colin Firth is the life of the show. He's fantastic, enacting a comedic role with flourish. Alan Rickman is alright. Cameron Diaz is sporty. Stanley Tucci is wasted. Tom Courtenay is cute.On the whole, 'Gambit' is a safe bet to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High on talent, but a bit short on laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gambit is a remake of an old Michael Caine film, where an art dealer (Firth) attempts to con his unbearable boss (Rickman) by enlisting the help of a beautiful, but slightly na?ve, American cowgirl (Diaz). With those three names on the cast list, you know it's going to be good, especially when it's written by the - critically-acclaimed - Coen brothers. However, you may be wrong.And it's not the fault of the actors. To put it simply, they're given very little to work with, script-wise. Cameron Diaz does what she does best, i.e. she's cute, a bit dippy, but thoroughly endearing nonetheless. Alan Rickman is...well, Alan Rickman - he's devious, cold-hearted and charming. Still, so far, so good, but then we come to Colin Firth - an actor who's proved his excellent credentials in numerous films. However, he's the protagonist here - attempting to basically rip-off his boss by foul means. Therefore, for us to feel sympathy towards him, we need to see him as more of a good-guy. Yet, he does very little to warm the audience towards him. He's spineless, a bit too weedy and, just because his boss isn't very nice, thinks he can take him for all he's worth. He doesn't even give us that many laughs (a few, but certainly not many). Unfortunately for him, Rickman steals the show and - despite obviously being the baddie - seems to charm the audience more than Firth can.I know Gambit is supposed to be an addition to the long line of British 'farce' films, but it does tend to rely a little too much on low-brow humour, rather than utilising the cast's natural talent. Also, because it's rated 12A, it can never really descend into the 'gross-out' territory and do anything too risky.Unfortunately, what you're left with is a very capable cast, being reduced to simply one of a number of stereotypes (the English are VERY English, Cameron Diaz is VERY Texan and the Japanese are VERY Japanese).It's not a bad film. I quite enjoyed it, plus it doesn't drag itself out for too long. It's charming enough in its own way, only with the heavyweight names that go with it, it could have been so much more than just an excuse to watch Cameron Diaz in hotpants.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a classic, just awfully dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised when this movie opened with a rather old looking animation. A cartoon character bumbles around the credits, opening them like doors or being squashed by the lettering. Pink Panther instantly sprang to mind.I was even more surprised to find the entire movie shot in the style of an old 70's comedy movies. The production, actors and settings are all new but the slap stick comedy, outlandish characters and the relentless double entendre are all very old.Back in the 80's when the staple TV films were the likes of 'On the Buses' and 'Carry On' I saw of lot of this kind of thing, but to be honest they were a bit dated back then.When one of the 'funniest' scenes centres around a man losing his trousers I felt like I had been sucked into a time warp. Oh I say nurse! Has anyone seen my pussy?The reason they stopped making films like this is audiences have generally become more sophisticated. If you fancy old school comedy, I would suggest picking up an old title that will surely be made with more integrity, skill and at least be current to the time it is set.On top of this; performances are bad, story is dull and predictable (and because of the format) production levels negligible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Remake of a Sixties Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A loose remake of the classic Sixties film starring Michael Caine and Shirley Maclaine, GAMBIT is a highly entertaining romp involving Colin Firth as a hapless master-criminal, Cameron Diaz as a rodeo specialist and Alan Rickman as a boorish bourgeois financier, supported by Tom Courtenay as a retired general acting as the narrator for the whole film. Filmed on location in and around London, it proves quite unexpectedly funny: Firth demonstrates a particular talent for comedy, simply by remaining straight-faced, while Diaz has great fun in an unexpected piece of casting. The plot is gossamer-thin, involving the creation of a fake painting which Caine hopes to sell to Rickman; what matters more is that the plan keeps going wrong. There are some memorable set-piece scenes here, notably Firth's parading up and down the halls of London's chic Savoy Hotel without his pants, or Diaz's untuneful karaoke rendition of "The Yellow Rose of Texas" in front of a group of Japanese business people. The Coen Brothers' script contains several hommages to the Sixties, while moving the action along at a great lick. Definitely a film to watch if you're feeling down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Liked this feel good surprisingly funny art caper comedy set in London. The stars are good and the dialog is cute. Colin Firth plays a man working for an unbearable boss (Alan Rickman) and devises a scheme to get back at him involving a forger Monet and a Rodeo queen. Cameron Diaz still has her stunning figure but her face is looking a bit older. Her Texan accent and hillbilly character are charming enough and not over the top. Colin Firth is suitably fumbling in this comic role - I haven't seen the original 60s version but I think Michael Caine would have been a bit irritating. Stanley Tucci has an amusing supporting role.The screenplay is more hit than miss. There are quite a few surprising jokes and laugh out loud moments throughout. The dialog is sharp and worth listening carefully to. There are unfortunately some jokes that fall flat especially in the hotel. Coen Brothers surprisingly can do a good comic caper script.Even if there is a slightly dated element in it because of the source of the story, it's pleasantly dated and worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had no idea what "Gambit" would be about when I watched. It was the stellar cast of Colin Firth, Cameron Diaz and Alan Rickman that convinced me to try this low-key film release. And I am sure glad I did."Gambit" is a funny little comedy about art curator Harry Deane (Firth) hatching a caper to sell a forgery of a Monet painting to his own haughty boss (Rickman). Deane picks an American rodeo champion, PJ Puznowski (Diaz) as accomplice, or does she have other plans up her sleeve?The very British comedy had been written by the very American Ethan and Joel Coen, with very wry and witty results. Surely, there is no out-of- the-box, off-the-wall "Fargo" or "No Country for Old Men" Coens in this film. This is simple and straightforward comedy. I wonder why they did not direct it themselves.Colin Firth gets away from his serious period films with this film where his character gets into the most unfortunate and ridiculous of circumstances. Alan Rickman plays a very rich, formal and ruthless CEO here, but we get to see him in a couple of the most embarrassing scenes of all. We will forget Prof. Snape as we watch this. Cameron Diaz again plays a pretty, perky girl, seemingly lacking brain matter, a character she can play with a blindfold, but nonetheless fun to watch. Distinguished British actor Tom Courtenay plays the very capable art forger Major, who is Deane's partner-in-crime.Overall, this is one very entertaining film. Those scenes of Colin Firth outside the window of the hotel were pretty funny, among many other scenes. It is fun. It is neat. I enjoyed it a lot.</fullReview>

The mimic was obvious but once removed,the closest thing that came to mind was Lesley Downs' quip to Burt Reynolds in Rough Cut: ''You're not doing Cary Grant. You're doing Tony Curtis doing Cary Grant.'' The rest of the cast played well, Stanley Tucci is always fun, and Cloris Leachman was priceless.

		<shortDescription>Quirky comedy with a funny cast and plenty of laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other reviewers have noted that "Gambit" isn't a film that draws out lots of laughter. Rather, it has witty lines and very clever scenes that are quite funny; with an occasional goofy bit that is just too funny not to laugh at. It's a bit of a combination of sophisticated (witty dialog) and goofy (silly scenes), which makes for a quirky comedy overall. This isn't a large production film, but it has quite a cast of actors with diverse characters. They all seem to meld together well (or not so, as the script intends). Colin Firth and Cameron Diaz are very good as the leads. But, the supporting cast and bit performances have some of the funniest lines. Alan Rickman is riotously funny. I have to laugh in the scenes where he wears a disapproving expression of "what's Deane doing now." Rickman is one of those actors whose wonderful humor drives home by his frowns and other facial expressions. When a line comes with the look, it's most often over the top hilarious. This is a wonderful funny film fiasco. I think an opening scene sets the stage for viewers to know they are in for an enjoyable and entertaining film. Colin Firth (Harry Deane) and Tom Courtenay (The Major) are on an errand from England, have landed in the U.S. and drive up to a gas and shop station somewhere in New Mexico rodeo country. They go inside where Joe Berryman is the gas station cashier. Deane says, "Excuse me. We were given to understand that there was an equestrian tourney in this area." The cashier says, "Well, we got a law attorney. Don't know his religion. Up downtown Alpine. He's a fairy. Moved here from Albuquerque. It'll be five, no six years ago come May. Not that I judge.

		<shortDescription>Degas and his Haystacks, what will one go through to get the painting?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie on Netflix streaming movies. I like the actors and the synopsis of the movie seemed funny enough. And in fact it is a nicely humorous movie and, even though we think we know where it is going next, it often surprises.It is about a shy, unappreciated art expert who has a very unsavory but wealthy boss. So he decides he will pull a big ruse, get his friend an accomplished painter of fakes to do the painting that the boss lusts after, a Degas, Haystacks in the field. He will convince the boss that the painting is worth 12 Million pounds sterling and sell it to him.To do that he travels to Texas to find a rodeo performer who has an ancestral connection to a stolen Degas from WW2 Nazi Germans. With appropriate cooperation they will travel back to London, he will make the sale, and pay the Texan a handsome fee for participating.The art expert is Colin Firth as Harry Deane. His forger is Tom Courtenay as The Major. The dastardly and abusive boss is the always excellent Alan Rickman as Lionel Shahbandar.The rodeo performer is Cameron Diaz in an appropriately zany role as PJ Puznowski. At first we think she is just a dumb Texan but as the story unfolds we see that she has "negotiating" talents also.Anyway the movie wraps up in a way that we did not expect, and overall is appropriately entertaining. SPOILERS: The end gets a bit complex, but as Lionel hires a different "expert" (Stanley Tucci) to verify the fake painting, which he does verify, Deane sprays a solvent on it, rubs out some paint with a rag, and exposes it as a fake. Meanwhile the other Degas, a real one, was swapped then stolen by Deane as the others are out of the room, so the ruse works, he gets a valuable painting of Lionel's and sells it to the Japanese at the airport, verifying that they transferred money to his Swiss account, while Lionel is shown still at home, examining his painting with a magnifying glass, no longer the real one but the fake.</fullReview>

Harry decides on a plan that involves his boss buying a fake Monet painting form someone he knows and taking the money. He just needs someone to play the person with the painting.

		<fullReview>I came to this because of the Coen brothers credit. It's an anomaly in their filmography ? one of only two feature-length films they wrote but didn't direct, and the first since 1985. Sure, the poster makes the film look a lot less art-house-ready than the last film of theirs I saw, but I've enjoyed a Coen brothers farce before. Maybe the reason it hasn't made it stateside is because it's a misunderstood oddball. Turns out, no, it's pretty easy to understand. It's a cheaply-felt farce, replete with broad stereotypes sporting funny-sounding accents and the usual game of misunderstandings, several of which looking like they could quickly end if only certain characters decided to use peripheral vision. You wonder how different this film would have looked if the Coen's script hadn't reportedly been reworked or if they directed it instead. I did enjoy the idea that our conman hero initially paints his mark as a cartoonish and sour individual. But when we meet him in a more objective gaze, he seems much more rational, though clearly impatient with his employee. There's an intriguing antihero-versus-antihero story in that. I wish the film had further explored that idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankly, I stopped paying much attention to this film after the second time Colin Firth got punched in the nose. Why is it considered funny to see a harmless person abused by a fat idiot? I find it disturbing and characteristic of a weak plot and inferior and unbelievable character development. Which is to say, there wasn't any. Firth was his generally understated engaging self and Alan Rickman was his usually aloof and interesting nasty guy. Cameron Diaz played her ditzy self, somewhat reprising her character in Something about Mary. But what a terrible waste of good actors. The star power in the film should have guaranteed a better film: Tom Courtenay, Stanley Tucci , Cloris Leachman, Ben Kingsley. And, for good measure, a couple of hot babes: Jennifer Aniston and Lisa Bonet. Stars, however, for the most part do what they are told and in this case what they were told was of not much help. This has to be the worst film ever written by Ethan and Joel Coen. Are they getting lazy? Or should the blame be placed on the director, Michael Hoffman? If you are looking for a piece of fluff that might appeal to people who don't take movies seriously, and if you enjoy watching babes and seeing people get hit in the face then you might like this film. But I much, much, much prefer the original Gambit starring Michael Caine and Shirley McLane. Save your money and save your time and see the earlier one instead. This one is just awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Colin Firth has a lot of fun with this, as is Cameron Diaz playing the most straight forwarded character in this movie. And probably the most honest one (bar a lie or two that is). Generally speaking the movie is deception, as any good movie should be. This more than others, but not in a way that is so great, that you really have to watch it.A nice little caper, emphasis on the "light". There is one particular segment though that is especially funny. Without spoiling it, I'll just say it involves Colin Firth, wardrobe malfunction and different rooms of a hotel, with nice little jokes thrown in the mix. It may be predictable, but it is also more than decent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of a 1966 Ronald Neame film of the same name, "Gambit" is a lightweight but amusing flick starring Colin Firth and Cameron Diaz as a couple of schemers who attempt to outwit a billionaire art collector."Gambit" was written by Joel and Ethan Coen. It lacks the humour of their best comedies, and jettisons the philosophical ruminations of Neame's 1966 picture. Firth's role, incidentally, was played by Michael Caine in the original. As a nod to Caine, Firth wears giant black spectacles throughout his picture, a reference to Harry Palmer, the protagonist of several Michael Caine thrillers.7.5/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this a good movie? your answer is "YES!!".Gambit has a very simple story and if you watch it carefully,it is easy to predict ending.Its not just about Harry Deane and his revenge ,Its about failure of dreams unless you take action and follow your dream in the REAL world(the opening sequence shows harry's plan comes together in his fantasies but what will really happens?).Brilliant screenplay by Coen brothers makes a perfect combination of realism and humor and a little bit crime.Colin Firth is playing a very different character with comparison to his previous roles and you will see,he can makes you laugh.Not to mention great performance by Alan Rickman(He plays Lionel Shahbandar,a selfish and rude boss).Cameron Diaz as the Texas cowgirl is very cute and believable.Michael Hoffman also really tried to make a funny movie with no complexity and a heist theme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Gambit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written by the Coen brothers Joel and Ethan, Gambit is the remake of the 1966 heist comedy of the same name starring Shirley MacLaine and Michael Caine, which this film had borrowed its base premise from in having what's expected played out in the mind of one of its protagonist, before having its actual execution go completely and hilariously wrong. And once this had started off as a troubled production with cast and crew suffered from a revolving doors syndrome, it finally nailed its key casting of Colin Firth, Cameron Diaz and Alan Rickman, all of whom prove to be what made Gambit an engaging movie to sit through and effortlessly hitting all the sweet spots that a heist comedy should hit.Colin Firth plays Harry Deane, an art curator working for Lionel Shahbandar (Alan Rickman), a mean and scrooge like businessman who doesn't think twice in hurling insults of all shapes and form at his employee base should they get in his way, in any way. Clearly unliked by many, and by Harry of course, who hatches a plot to skim millions off his employer as revenge. To do so meant to come up with an elaborate plot involving Monet's Haystacks series of paintings, and travelling the world in search of a possible bait to play along and boost the credibility of the story he concocts. This brings together The Major (Tom Courtenay), a master forger, and P.J. Puznowski (Cameron Diaz), a ditzy cowgirl from the USA to bolster his plot for a cool promise of a half a million sterling pound reward for basically sealing the deal.And true to the original work, we get to see how the perfect heist plays out in perfect terms, as would any heist film in laying out the challenge, and the objective, with a quick run of the process and the plan in order to fulfill what the motley crew got assembled for. But when things start to swing into action, this means Murphy's Law being applied liberally by the Coen Brothers, and makes for a hilarious film with excellent comic timing brought on by all three leads. Classical moments include the entire sequence at the Savoy hotel as Harry got sidetracked into trying to go for a Ming vase, and of course, the inevitable twist within the twist as its crescendo that makes this very much fulfilling and less empty had this been nothing more than a straight-forward narrative.Colin Firth proved to be more than capable in being the gentleman's gentleman with an axe to grind with his employer, and getting back through the only means he knows how, being surprisingly quick thinking especially toward the end. stanely Tucci makes a small supporting appearance as his professional adversary, while over the top, does suggest a thought about how we tend to think that foreign experts are the best, often overlooking equally capable, or in some instances, more than capable, locals for the job. Firth's comic timing is impeccable, and is primarily responsible for holding the narrative together. Diaz goes back to what she does best as the ditzy blonde with her own street smarts to get out of sticky situations, who is aware that she holds the key to the success of Harry's absurd plan, while Alan Rickman shows what it takes to be a fiend, and yet a likable one whose presence and background may draw a sympathetic eye or two.Like almost all heist films, the payload is toward the end where things get revealed for what they truly are. Gambit has more than its fair share of surprises, reaffirming some plot points brought up but debunked early, and red herrings galore that got closed off. This is probably the Coen Brother's most accessible story to date, playing it in straightforward fashion, and while it's no insult to director Michael Hoffman, perhaps the film may be more interesting if we got to see the Coen Brothers' take on this. Still, for what it's worth, Gambit is recommended for the performance of its cast who delivered as expected without playing against type.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Deane is an expert in fine art, but he's equally accomplished in taking abuse from his abhorrent boss. But that's about to change though. The plan is to trick the art collector into buying a fake Monet painting. To assist in the heist, Deane hires a rowdy cowgirl to help him fool the cad. But as the plan begins to unravel, Deane finds he is falling for the rodeo queen, ensuing further complications.....If you don't mind the fact that Firth spends one major set piece trouserless for comedic effect, its a pretty funny romp, that was surprisingly given negative reviews on initial release.But it's no masterpiece. In fact, it reminds one of those seventies movies inspired by TV shows of the same era. Think Man Of The House, Please Sir, or Bless This House, and your pretty much in the zone.Firth is as good as he always is, and predictably Rickman steals the film, but kudos to Courtenay, who raises the film from averageness whenever he's on screen.Its a caper alright, something that will end up on Channel 4 in the afternoon before Countdown in about ten years.It's utterly average, I didn't laugh once, but it's like its leads, charming for charming sake...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, but not in the right way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GENUINELY, one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune to see. I don't know what possessed all those involved to agree to lend their names to this project, but it makes me highly suspicious about the validity of this remake, and whether the Cohen brothers are REALLY the people to be adapting a script of this nature. The performances are over- exaggerated and in point of fact actually not CAMP enough! Even the king of camp, namely Alan Rickman leaves us disappointed. I mean, we expect nuttiness from Cameron, but we see here that her Achilles heal is accents. Even I, as an Englishman, can hear she just doesn't have it, which is irritating and distracting. Colin Firth should stick to being who he is, and not allow himself to be so "directed". To sum up, this a complete car crash of a remake, which insults the original, and should never have reached the screen, and it says a good deal about the cynicism of the distributors that they still want to sell this drivel to the public. They will only ruin their reputations in doing so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it is only a holiday. for cast, for public. so, it is not the case to see it very seriously. because it is less than a version of original Gambit. an interesting list of actors and a game without great/many ambitions. just fun with few sparkles of classic romance. this is cause for who every comparison with original/ the usual performance of actors/ original can be only a great mistake. because it is an ordinary comedy, full of crazy situations, with a Colin Firth interesting in clothes of his unusual role, with Cameron Diaz in skin of her usual character. so, nothing new. so, it is not a bad idea to see it. only for a form of humor who can make the things more easy.</fullReview>

Cameron diaz is a pretty good actor but its just the script that doesn't do it. if you like what happens and Vegas and bad teacher and you are hoping on a comedy like that... your wrong. I'm just going to try save you some time here and if I'm not a negative person I'm just realistic and it isn't a good movie at all. you can better go to bar and get drunk then spending your money at this. cheers</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The remake of the 1966 comedy caper Gambit was a film 15 years in the making. It was marketed heavily on the name of The Coen Brothers who provided the script but Gambit is the weakest film of theirs which I have seen.Harry Deane (Colin Firth) is a art curator who an arrogant, rich and malevolent media tycoon, Lord Lionel Shabandar (Alan Rickman) who is a major art collector. Upset with his years of mistreat, Harry attempts to use Lionel's craving for Monet's lost Haystacks at Dusk, having the help of a talented art forger (Tom Courtenay) and a sassy Texan (Cameron Diaz) who has a link to real painting.Gambit is very board comedy; it uses many clichés and plays it very safe. Gambit relies on board stereotypes of different nationalities, uses some crude humour involving a fart and vomiting and giving Firth a Johnny English character, someone who thinks he is much better then he really is. There are repeat jokes and running gags as the film strains for a laugh, as Harry gets punched in the face, the constant embarrassment Harry suffers and the many misunderstanding involving Harry's sexual prowess in the Savoy Hotel. There are some mildly assuming moments, but they are too few and far between and there are not enough to substance a comedy.The cast was wasted and in the cast of Stanley Tucci gives an embarrassing performance as a Euro-Trash stereotype: it was cringe worthy with what he had to do from someone who is so talented. Rickman has made a career as a villain for hire and even he felt like he was just mugging and forcing his performance. Diaz was the strongest performance, even if she was playing a clichéd Texan who keeps quoting her mother, but least she is a strong, confidence woman with street smarts, it makes you wonder why she is working in a chicken factory? Harry as a characters should have been written that he is suave and an excellent planner, but goes to pieces when things go wrong, or that he is too arrogant to think anything could go wrong.Gambit has a very old fashioned, starting with an animated credit sequence, very much like the Pink Panther, but nowhere need as good, to the fantasy heist with editing copying the Oceans films to the score which was reminiscence of classic crime capers. But it was all old hat and Gambit felt like it should have been made another time. The biggest offence is the stereotypes of characters, we live in a digital, multimedia age and people know what people in other country are like. It was a bit embarrassing with two British characters in Texas talking in a stupidly posh way to a local, all Texans dress in cowboy gear, etc? Admittedly it was fun to see Courtenay, a 75-year-old man kicking ass in a bar and it is not a complete disaster of a film. There are some decent moments, but it is still very weak and the worst Coen Brothers film I have seen. If you want to watch a good comic film about art theft then go for Headhunters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Please do not go and waste any time on this tripe. OK, there are some big names - some of them delivering their lines pretty damn well. However, the story is pants. The worst is that the direction is from a complete and utter non-entity. With the material supplied by the Coen brothers along with the potential in the fabulous cast you'd think this would be a sure fire winner. It ain't. It is interesting that this movie is being sold on the screen play - i.e. the bit contributed by the Coens. Now, that just shows you how weak this film is. If you go to an Almodovar film you know how much Directing makes a difference. So, this Hoffman film is exactly that...."Who?" "Never heard of him" etc etc. It mirrors pretty much the so-called story line. You go to see a 'Coen' movie - it turns out not to be a 'Coen'. The Coens' mates have all done their best in pulling off the fraud but in the end you're left staring at a pastiche of the real thing that was never there in the first place. The emperor is wearing no clothes...(Oh you naughty Coens.We can see you laughing behind our backs).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If people are paying to watch a movie, this is one of the worst movies they can spend their money on. There have been many missed opportunities for comical and witty remarks. The plot line is very weak, not much story to it. Its neither a comedy nor entertaining, even with some mild humour but you don't need to watch it in the cinemas. It can be watched on TV. It should have been a straight to DVD movie. I got a orange Wednesday offer so i didn't pay for it but i can imagine how my friend felt as he had to do the paying. The famous stars like Alan Rickman, Cameron Diaz and Colin Firth is the only thing going for the movie.</fullReview>

Sadly Colin Firth was mostly to blame. All the others were OK.The cast, and the fact that the script was by the Coen brothers meant that our expectations were high. Sadly had our expectations been low this film would have failed to meet them. I laughed once and honestly thought the film had "audience" laughter added to the soundtrack. Interesting to hear if anyone else notices that. Firth sack your agent, after Kings Speech you should be demanding better scripts.</fullReview>
