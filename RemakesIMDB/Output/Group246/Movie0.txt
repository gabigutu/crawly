		<shortDescription>A Wacky and "Out There" Musical that's a lot of Fun...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1986 film version of the Broadway musical LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS is an entertaining movie based on the black comedy from the 1960's about a nerdy milquetoast who raises a man-eating plant that gets totally out of control. Rick Moranis is perfection as Seymour, the nebbish who is at a loss at what to do when his own Frankenstein grows too big for him to control and Ellen Greene (reprising her role in the original musical) is delightful as Audrey, the object of Seymour's affections. Moranis and Greene make one of the most engaging screen teams I've seen in a while. Vincent Gardenia plays the greedy flower shop owner, Mr. Mushnik and Bill Murray is hysterically funny in one scene as Arthur Denton, a man who seems to enjoy going to the dentist a little too much. Tischina Arnold, Tisha Campbell, and Michelle Weeks are awesome as the Greek Chorus known as "The Urchins" and Steve Martin practically steals the movie as "Orin Scrivello, DDS". His song "Be a Dentist" is hysterically funny. The voice of the plant, Audrey II, is provided by Levar Stubbs of The Four Tops and he is superb. A fun musical comedy that the whole family can enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, not the black &amp; white Roger Corman jewel featuring Jack Nicholson, though I suppose I'd watch that one again too. I'm talking about the 1986 color musical with Rick Moranis and Audrey II by way of Frank Oz. Like I tell my friends about "Babe," I love a film with a Greek chorus. In this one, the chorus consists of three Motownish women singers, Crystal, Chiffon and Ronette. I'll watch this film again, just to hear them sing one line: "TO ? TAL ? E ? CLIPSE ? OF ? THE ? SUN!" This is an all-singing, all-dancing science fiction black comedy that features human misery, a sadistic dentist, a masochistic patient, casual murder, girlfriend abuse, and a blood-sucking alien house plant monster. It's hilarious from beginning to end. And the music is outstanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depravity: The Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:I am just so gauche. Forgive me, was that a song by a girlfriend beating, sadistic dentist on a motorcycle to a catchy Elvis tune supposed to be funny? How about one pushing a grandma off a cliff to a Lady GaGa tune? Do lyrics even matter anymore? Yes, another nice song about, how because downtown is awful and dangerous, apparently we are morally justified in doing just about anything to anybody? Ellen Greene's voice sounds like the slow strangulation of a cat; I understand it is supposed to provide moral justification for Martin whaling on her but, no, believe it or not it is still wrong. What do you expect from the man who featured the rape of a hot blond by a lonely, giant maggot in Galaxy Of Terror? Can I say something? The more of your movies I watch the more motion lights and weapons I am buying. Who is our hero in this film: The pathetic, acne covered geek who could not get action in a bordello? The girlfriend beating, sadistic dentist? The greedy, cruel florist? See, if all of your characters are loathsome swine, believe it or not, it makes your movie a pile of poop. What is with the traveling chorus, is this Sophocles?The movie is not bad; the movie is disturbing. I love when Miss Piggy decides to spare Seymour from killing Martin; later, he feeds Mushnick to the plant. We are treated to the shadows of him dismembering him in the back alley. Look, Yoda, if you are going depraved on us try not to P out OK? Crappy it is, run from the theater you should. What was the point with Martin? The film is not funny; the movie is revolting and repulsive. Some times being a philosopher here is such a task: depravity set to catchy music is still depravity. Everyone in the movie, including the cat screecher, is a loser or a depraved maniac. Who gives a crap about any of them? I am supposed to sympathize with Seymour? He is our hero? The murdering, acne covered dweeb? Look, Oz sucks as a director, all of his pictures stink. After this, he made Dirty Rotten Scoundrels which also was not funny. Young people, this opened in the back of a ten theater multiplex, within two weeks the movie was gone forever. My brother and I had never seen a new movie open in that small of a theater; it is obvious that the manager had screened it before the opening. It is not funny; it is fruity and freaky. It bespeaks a mind desperately in need of high voltage liberally applied to the cerebrum. Bill Murray makes a cameo as a masochist seeking sexual satisfaction frequenting dentists like others do bars. Bring the kids. If you like woman beating, dismemberment, cat strangling singing, and mass murder; hey, this is the film for you. Yes, when I saw his giant maggot ripping that woman's clothes off and sliming her; then use your imagination, the first thought was he ought to make a musical. What a genius!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most unappreciated films of the eighties, the songs, performances, and especially the affectionate screenplay all harken back to the cheap old days of Roger Corman and his B movie compatriots. From Steve Martin's sadistic Elvis-inspired dentist to the early girl-group rock score, "Little Shop" moves with an appropriately cheesy style that lets you in on the joke, yet never insults you for loving those poverty row movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I certainly don't understand the low rating on here for this film - if you've never seen it before don't let that put you off watching it.LSOH was my 'family movie' as a kid, introduced to us by our dentist uncle. Everything about it is just perfect it - is funny, self-aware and contains too many brilliant scenes to count. The songs are consistently great and the casting is spot on. I especially love all the amazing cameos: Bill Murray, John Candy etc.Whenever I'm ill or feeling down, all I need to do to feel better is just watch this film. I never trust anyone says they don't like this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Offbeat Horror-Musical Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, only a few songs are memorable. The main theme and when "Audrey 2" sings are the best. The song "Suddenly Seymour" is good but not great. The best song is "Downtown", a true send-up of the Petula Clark classic. Ellen Greene's revealing push-up front is quite annoying and Steve ("Elvis") Martin is the meanest dentist of all time with Bill Murray his strangest pain-loving patient. Look for other cameos, including John Candy and Jim Belushi. (I actually had a dentist not wait for the Novocain to kick-in, so I changed dentists.) Frank Oz at his best and that great 4-Tops &amp; Motown Sound. I love the "Slumtown Supremes". A great and scary plant-"puppet". Just wonderful. At it's worst, a true "horror" film but no worse than the old black and white original. Fun-to-watch, but little kids will have nightmares. A guilty pleasure, worth seeing from time-to-time! Only surpassed by "Rocky Horror Picture Show" as a classic Halloween movie-musical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feed Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1986 musical version is adapted from the successful Off Broadway play. The film was shot in London and filmed in the style of a musical play hence you get this interior staged bound feel to this movie.Rick Moranis plays Seymour a nerdy, hapless and put upon flower shop boy owned by Mr Mushnik (Vincent Gardenia.) Seymour is in love with the blonde, beautiful Audrey (Ellen Greene) but she is going out with psycho, motor biking dentist Orin (Steve Martin.)After an eclipse Seymour discovers a new plant which becomes an instant hit with the customers who all flock to the shop to admire it. The plant which Seymour calls Audrey II needs feeding and as it gets bigger so does his lust for human flesh and blood.The film is uneven, some of the song numbers are interesting but too many are overbearing or just drone on. Moranis is in his element as the put upon nerdy type with dark edges as he goes along with the desires of his insatiable plant maybe from outer space voiced by Levi Stubbs. Ellen Greene is simply delectable and divine as Audrey. It is left to Martin to deliver the laughs as the sadistic biker and the best scenes are between him and Bill Murray as the masochist patient who leave Martin questioning his nastiness.It is a fine enough retro musical and the version I saw also had the alternate and a more grim ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than a recent film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally reviewed on Letterboxd on 14th August 2016.AT LONG LAST. WATCHING THE DIRECTOR'S CUT AS EVERYBODY SHOULD AS WELL.An wonderful musical with a wonderful cast. And it feels so much more emotional and complete with the original ending. There's need to be pain in this musical and the alternate ending feels so much forced. Proves the general public is scared and is also scared of real emotion in films like Suicide Squad although we don't know for certain if deleted scenes will make that stupid film better. Thing is though, the filmmakers were so lucky that there got very positive reviews from critics (90% on RT) even though there was always the risk of huge audiences watching the original musical and saying that the original ending was better. But the thing with either the original ending or the alternative, it was funny and emotional, the cast was great, no matter which version you've watched although the original ending will always stand superior in its lengthy finale and its creativity. Ellen Greene, I'll only love your Audrey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I usually loathe remakes but this is a gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a black campy horror film remake of a 1960 film of the same ilk. The original is typical of Ed Wood, Hammer Film Productions of the era, low budget horror, actors not that well know at the time, crank it out fast, under or at budget.This remake is just perfect, it's polished without taking away from the original, it has a strong feeling of seeing a theater performance, not surprising since it is base on an off Broadway musical production, but here you get close ups of the actors, I enjoy a lot how it was film in this theater vs movie style.The doo-wop and that old black 60s Motown sound peppered thru it is just wonderful and fits the movie well. Love how the actors are allowed to use their own voice belting it out, with very little enhancing. Steve Martin's evil Elvis dentist is just throttled back enough for a great performance, Rick Moranis carries the movie well as the plant geek, all the actors are top notched. Even the Plant, well he is a mess and full off himself, love the steal the coin from the cash register to make a call scene, that smirk of being so pleased with himself.I still enjoy the original black and white but this one is so good, unfortunately it's an unfair comparison, this was no low budget film and was based on one of the most profitable off Broadway musical ever, something like a 5 year run, over 2,000 performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this movie currently at 1am at work for the first time in 15 years (watched it when I was a kid) and I enjoyed every part of this movie. Didn't notice at all that Rick M. can sing. Favorite song is "Suddenly Seymour", calm to BOOM vocals on both parts, loved Ellen Greene. People on the discussion forums say her voice is annoying, I disagree insanely, he voice is the most attractive part of her character. Okay so great movie, great songs, a decent dark comedy/ musical, a entertaining movie for the family to watch. Though swearing is some what common but great movie. Enjoy, its worth a once-watch at least, for all you skeptics out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Someone took a cheesy, 1960s movie a turned it into gold!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And what a great concept it was! The original version was lame, along with the ending leading to disappointment. Frank Oz obviously felt the same, and decided to do a beautiful, SF musical version you see before you! Rick Moranis stars as a nerdy guy who works in florist's shop, and has a crush on a beautiful girl named Audrey. He fantasizes about being happily married to her in a suburban home, with a picket fence, and two adoring children.The problem is she don't know how he feels about her, and to top it off, she's stuck in an abusive relationship with a scummy boyfriend named Orin. And the shop isn't selling and thing at all, causing his boss, Mushnik to be hard on him.It seems like his dreams will never come true, that is until he finds a strange plant during an eclipse. He thinks its a type of Venus Flytrap, so he takes it inside and calls it Audrey II. He later discovers that its no ordinary, bug eating plant one day, when it wilts and he tries everything to revive it. He accidentally cuts his finger, and when it bleeds the plant starts making sucking noises. He figures out that it needs blood to eat, and he feeds it this everyday.This just suits Audrey II just fine, until it grows excessively large. Thats when it suddenly speaks to Seymour, and demands him to feed him something much more gruesome. Steve Martin does a fine job as Orin, the sadistic and amoral dentist, whose dental gear resembles medieval torture devices. He also has an obvious addiction to laughing gas. Many of the memorable songs from this movie are: Mean Green Mother From Outer Space, the title song and Be A Dentist!This movie is also seen as something of black comedy as well, with many of the dark things going on in this movie. It is a fine classic,(and dark) remake you won't soon forget. If the Broadway version shows up in your town, make an effort to see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little Shop of Horrors=GREATEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't be alarmed by the title. Little Shop of Horrors is about as much fun as you get with musical movies. Even the villain, Audrey II, is somebody to like. Little Shop is one of those movies that you'll want to watch over and over again. The thing with this movie is, there's nothing really not to like about it. The Music is Legendary with it's peppy and catchy tunes (my favorite is Mean Green Mother From Outer Space) and at the same time has heart to it. I've listened to the soundtrack countless times, and it's still just as good as the first time. The cast is ultra-awesome. Rick Moranis was by FAR the right choice for Seymour. His sweetness, nerdy-like characteristics, and timidness all forms well to create the perfect vision about what the character should be like, and is surprisingly a talented singer. Frank Oz made a very good decision about taking Ellen Green from the off-Broadway show to the screen version, with her speech impediment becoming perfect for Audrey's cutesy tone and kindness. And of course, course, who could forget STEVE MARTAIN!!!!! Steve Martain may have some limited scenes, but he steals every scene as the psychopath dentist with his perfect over the top insanity, which he displays perfectly into Orin, making even him a likable character. But most of all, who could forget rock star Levi Stubbs, who you never see on screen but he hear him yell FEED ME!!!!!!! He proves himself to be a voicer full of dynamics and character, but rocks the house with "Supertime" "Feed Me" and "Mean Green Mother From Outer Space." And Vincent Gardenia, who doesn't even get to sing, still proves himself to be the right choice for Mr. Mushnick, who's emotions, and his sense of environment are as believable from when you see him first reading the paper to being eaten by the plant.But the three characters you can't resist are the Skid Row Supremes, all cast in nationwide auditions. They have absolute pitch, deliver perfect sense of rhythm, and have first-rate singing voices, things you almost never see in musical movies today.As for the rest of the team. Howard Ashman's book and lyrics are astounding. Both tell a story that could've been so much more dark and scary, and instead use perfectly crafted over-the-top humor to appeal to musical-theater lovers out there. And Frank Oz (a.k.a. YODA!!!!!!) flawlessly directs the actors to deliver the over-the-top humor in ways that will stick to you, make you want to reenact scenes, and for the most part, have a ton of fun watching every scene!I've seen good movies before, but this sticks out from every other one, and you'll be feeling the same way too when your mind is blown by this mega-awesome movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, it's definitely mean. And I guess green as well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A nerdy shop assistant and a wannabe botanical mad scientist Seymour (Rick Moranis) discovers an abandoned plant, which he nurses back to health, in the process turning the fortunes of his boss' flower shop and earning the admiration of his fellow assistant Audrey (Ellen Greene). The only problem being the actual nursing, for the carnivorous plant requires his blood to thrive.Little Shop of Horrors is a love letter to the early B-films. Every single character is a stereotype of a stereotype, from the nerdy protagonist to the extreme doormat of a love interest suffering in a bad relationship, from which only her one true love could possible safe her, to the bullying jock villain to the greedy boss. The story line is also pretty much textbook and very clichéd, though in a somewhat unexpected way. You've definitely seen all the elements before, but the film can still surprise you with the way it mixes those elements together. It's definitely not a perfect blend, because the middle part of the film drags quite a bit and the characters are such cardboard cutouts that you don't really identify with them, making the drama part of the film fail miserably.But the humour works. The plant is a lot of fun, with its deep, booming voice and impossible demands. The jock bully has probably the best twist surprise in the whole film, plus the best song, and the love interest is so whimpering and so under the thumb that it turns from annoying to kind of funny more than once. And the original ending, which was restored in 2012 by the studio, is so over the top that you cannot help but laugh because of its dark humour.The music is also pretty good, heavily utilizing these three background singer girls, who're always switching roles to fit into the situation. Though I do have to admit that very few of the songs are all that memorable. Both the villain songs are amazing, and you'll be humming them for weeks, and the opening number does set the mood very well, but all the others I have no recollection of, and it hasn't been that long.All in all, the movie is something of a mixed package. It has some truly great moments and an excellent initial idea, but it flows something haltingly and the two main characters could have been fleshed out a bit more. Still, definitely worth a watch if camp is your thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Little Shop of Horrors" is so amazingly special and unique, that viewing it almost transports you to another world. It's quite possibly the best film representation of a stage musical ever made--the sets are perfect, the casting is perfect, the music is perfect, and everything else about the film is perfect. Rick Moranis, Vincent Gardenia, and Steve Martin are all wonderful as Seymour Krelborn, Mushnik, and Orin Scrivello, DDS. However, my favorite performance in this film is that of Ellen Greene (who reprises her part from Broadway). The role of Audrey, Seymour's bubbly, sexy yet innocent co-worker with low self-esteem was made for her. I heard that the role was first offered to Barbara Striesand (who declined), and I am SO glad Ellen ended up getting it! Maybe the reason why some people, though very few, don't care for this movie is that there has never really been another film (that I'm aware of) even remotely like it. I just hope one day this film gets re-released into theaters!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Take: Definitely one of my favorite musicals of all time. The last few months of the year 2008 have not been good to me, but it has its ups and downs. The limelights? A reunion with an old favorite: None other than the 80's hit musical LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS. I remember watching LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS as a kid, and I remembered loving it. I've been hunting to see this movie for quite sometime. Thankfully, it caught me in surprise on TV one time, then I went out seeing it again... and again on DVD, still being fresh each time. It's the best movie of its kind, even if I don't know exactly what kind of movie it is.LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS combines two delightful concepts: A joyous, old-fashioned musical and a send-off of the campy, low-budget B-movies of the B&amp;W era. In fact, which you all might know by now, this brilliant concept all started from one big joke, from Roger Corman no less. Corman produced the original LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS as a mere joke that he can make a film with a reused set from another movie and a limited shooting schedule of two days. The result was a film that was ignored in its initial release, but earned its cult following subsequent years later. One of this avid admirers is David Geffen, who has just come up with a brilliant idea: turn the film into a silly, bent Broadway musical. Strange, maybe if it wasn't so good. The musical was a surprise success, even loved by Mr. Corman himself. So it was inevitable for Geffen to take his brilliant idea one step further: turn it into a big-budget Hollywood production.Originally attached to the project is Martin Scorcese and Steven Spielberg, doing the movie in a very modest budget. But the reigns eventually went to puppeteer Frank Oz (most remembered as the voice of Yoda), with the budget exceeding $30 million. Plus the film was also legendary for flushing out $2 million worth of special effects after the menacing original ending tested poorly (deemed too dark) on test audiences, with an improved Hollywood happy ending made to replace it. Still, despite the expenses and some of the criticism toward the film, LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS is still one of the best times I had in watching movies. The movie is a funhouse of endless entertainment packed with silly laughs, memorable musical numbers, tuneful songs, fine acting and outrageous special effects (even in this CG era, the Audrey II puppet created by Lyle Conway is still very convincing).Rick Moranis stars as a down-on-his-luck slob Seymour Krelborn, who works in a bankrupt florist shop in the outcast district of Skid Row, where all the outcasts reside, including his bankrupt boss Mushnick (Vincent Gardenia) and battered beauty Audrey (Ellen Greene, reprising her off-off Broadway role). But when he finds a small, potted plant which he calls Audrey II, his life's about change. He becomes a great success, with the florist shop and boss right along with him. But there's a catch: Little Audrey II's hungry for blood, and he's growing... and growing... and growing. So how does Seymour feed a giant, singing man-eating vegetable? Nothing big, just chopping-up and killing people! LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS is quite like the "Springtime for Hitler" scene from Mel Brook's THE PRODUCERS. It's a little sick and dark on one hand, with a concept that's totally beyond its league, but in the end, it's fun, funny and peppered with inspired moments that never fails to make you smile in every frame. What are you waiting for? Feed yourself with the oddball delight of the irresistible LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS.Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

The cast is superb, Moranis surprisingly has a good singing voice. The only actress I don't like is Ellen Greene (her voice drives me crazy every time I hear her). At least I don't go to some sadistic dentist. Probably the best part of the movie has to be Audrey II, he's so real and has a lot of personality. Levi Stubbs (R.I.P.) is phenomenal doing his voice. I can even impersonate him. I love all the songs especially skid row- which a lot of people today are facing. I will forever remember this line "Feed me Krelbourne! Feed me NOW!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8 or 9/10 for the theatrical release, but 10/10 for Frank Oz's original version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If your idea of a great musical is less 'Singing in the Rain', 'West Side Story' or 'South Pacific' and more 'Hairspray', 'Rocky Horror, and 'Phantom of the Paradise' then you simply must check out Frank Oz's Little Shop of Horrors.Based on the off-Broadway show, which was itself based on the cult Roger Corman movie, this marvellously entertaining piece of sci-fi schlock horror is funny, romantic, a little scary (well, my kids thought so), and huge fun from start to finish.Rick Moranis stars as Seymour Krelborn, a nerdish shop assistant in a skid-row florists. Seymour's pitiful life changes drastically, however, when he discovers an unusual plant and takes it back to his workplace: the strange specimen brings the lonely horticulturist fame and fortune, plus the chance of finally scoring with busty blonde co-worker Audrey (Ellen Greene). The only problem is that the plant needs constant feeding, and Miracle-Gro just won't do.... no, this sucker wants blood, and lots of it!Moranis makes a likable leading man, and shows off a surprisingly good singing voice, whilst Ellen Greene impresses not only with her incredible vocals, but also with her amazing body, which often threatens to steal the show. These two leads are joined by a fine supporting cast, which includes top comedy performers of the day Steve Martin, Bill Murray, John Candy, Christopher Guest, and James Belushi.The real star of the film, however, is 'Audrey II', the alien plant creature voiced by The Four Tops' Levi Stubb's; this 'mean green mother from outer space' is a miracle of special effects with its fluid movements and impeccable lip-synching making it one of the finest examples of animatronics I have ever seen in a film.The theatrical release of Little Shop of Horrors?the one that is currently available on DVD and the one I first saw back in 1986?ends with Seymour destroying the monstrous pot-plant and living happily ever after with Audrey; it's a lot of fun and is easily worth a rating of at least 8/10. But if you think that is good, be sure to check out Frank Oz's original, downbeat, apocalyptic ending, which was rejected by test audiences; it's on You Tube and will leave you gob-smacked. Now that version is definitely worth full marks! Let's hope there's a Director's Cut available on DVD sometime real soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly I should state that, in general, I *loathe* musicals. Can't stand them. Although I love music. Secondly, this is my favourite film of all time. The acting, the songs, the plant... the whole thing is close to perfection. Funniest song, with the BEST lyrics ever - "Dentist!" Most moving song (guaranteed goose-bumps even after 20 viewings) -"Suddenly, Seymour". Ellen Green has a powerhouse voice and Rick Moranis' voice does just as much as it should to stay in-tune and in-character. Levi Stubbs is excellent as the voice of 'Audrey'. If my house were falling down, I'd grab my dogs, my L.S.O.H. DVD and then my husband, in that order!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>captures the musical on film without compromising the theatrical attributes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film. The music is amazing. The set was created to look rather theatrical and noir - an om-age to the original movie and off Broadway musical. A lot of musicals adapted to the film medium end up losing a lot of their good attributes in exchange for a more classic Hollywood approach to film making. An example is the recent adaptation of the Broadway hit Rent to film. Though the music was good, it's story was changed around and many of the songs were altered or left out completely. Even more awkward was many of the original singing lines were converted into speaking lines... speaking lines that rhymed. Rhyming works in musicals... as long as they are being sung. Anwyay, I think I've made my point. If you want to see a highly entertaining musical that will have you laughing out loud, I highly suggest watching this film. Steve Martin's special appearance as the "demented dentist" is more than I can bare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best musicals you can get for sheer comedy and surprise musical talent. I would recommend any comedy fan to get this out!! I felt that for Steve Martin this was one of his funniest performances of his life, and Rick Moranis has shown he can be not only funny, but very musical. I have bought the DVD and am getting the music on Cd in the new year so I can be a complete fan and play it in my car!! I hope they never re do this as it will spoil the original flavour of the movie, and I don't think they could get anyone to replace the original cast and make it work as well. Possibly ask the old cast to re do it.... now that would be worth seeing!! In conclusion... one of the funniest, darkest most catchy musical there is to date.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seymour (Rick Moranis) is a klutz of a shop assistant that works in a unsuccessful flower shop and is deeply in love with his co-worker Audrey (Ellen Greenie) who's dating a sadistic dentist (Steve Martin), but when he discovers a weird looking plant one day and decides to nurture it and place it in the shop's window. There's a sudden interest as nobody knows anything about it. Suddenly, his famous and the shop has a change of fortune, with business flowing all because of Seymour's unique plant named Audrey II, which people come to see. But what nobody knows, except for Seymour that Audrey II is no ordinary plant, but an men eating one which craves more and more blood. So, now Seymour is knocking off unexpected victims to fulfil its needs and if not he might share the same fate? Another musical this week, *hmm* last time I check I remember not being too fond of that genre, but watching this and "The Happiness of the Katakuris" (2001) has probably changed that around. Could it? Uh, actually if I think about it, the possible reason why, is because I enjoyed the unusual and campy nature of both. Well, both were hardly a dreary viewing and I enjoyed the nostalgia feel of the 80s within this piece.Anyway, director Frank Oz does a fine job on this rapidly inventive remake of the off-Broadway musical which was influenced by Roger Corman's cheap and quickie 1960's version of "The Little Shop of Horrors." Which is one of my favourite Corman productions, if not my favourite. This remake is definitely a strange piece with it boasting some bold musical numbers and juicy dialogue. Reality is thrown out of the window, but it was highly entertaining because of that. At least it still manages to keep the dark humour that flowed in the original. These musical sequences are colourfully drawn up, with fairly catchy tunes and the backdrop/sets where covered with great amount of detail even though they come across more plastic than anything. But hold on there, you know what really makes this film better? the lively performances. Especially from some standout star cameos. Which you got to put it down to Steve Martin's joyous performance as the sadist dentist. He just shapes the film for me and that song "I'm a Dentist" was a real ball to listen to. But also that scene in the dentist with Bill Murrey as a masochist had me cracking up as well. Others to make some memorable appearances were John Candy, James Belushi and Christopher Guest. The main players were perfect in their roles. Rick Moranis as the bumbling but sweet Seymour looked and acted the part and the same for Ellen Greenie as Audrey. Vincent Gardenia was good too as Mr. Mushnik the flower shop owner.The musical score was done by multiple Academy Award winners Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, so it was sure to exceed everyone's expectations. Howard Ashman's screenplay makes sure that there's a lot fun to be had with its amusing scenarios and broad humour, but also making the beat grow within each reel. What went hand and hand was the sharp editing and showy camera-work. The effects were top-notch, I thought. Audrey II was sublime in appearance, the puppet looked great! Plus the personality of it shined with the song "Mean green mother from outer space" being one of the film's highlights. Although I bet when it came to the bigger versions of the plant it was a pain to shoot. A rather polished production, despite its miniature budget.What disappointed me more than anything was that when I watched the commentary and learnt they change the ending because their test screen audience didn't like the two central characters being killed off, so they went back and re-shot a happy ending, which I thought felt misplaced. Really, I wouldn't have cared if they got knocked off. Oh well it looks like I'm in the minority, as most people I read prefer this ending.An enjoyably trashy romp of a musical!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A satire of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people miss the point of this film. It is not perverted or trashy. 'Little Shop of Horrors' the musical is a class act all the way. It is even a good family film. Yes, there are some dark elements in the film, but life can be very dark. The film spoofs everything from America's love of horror and sci-fi, bad films, to America's shameful urban decay in it's inner cities. The film boldly confronts poverty in America and the desperate, unhappiness of the lives of the people in it. The film is basically sociology put to music. Anyone that finds this film tedious or stupid, is behaving in a really limited and narrow minded way. The film has too much insight and class to be stupid, and there is so much visual humour and design for it to be boring. If you don't like the film it is probably because you can't handle the truth. Life is dark and not everyone is rich and perfect like on 'The Hills'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fanatic of musicals, this film is one of the best movie adaptations of a musical I've seen! Frank oz has captured what the show is really about from the spoof 'B' movie element to the general musical sense. The cast are fantastic (especially Rick Moranis as the down trodden worker turn superstar Seymore Krelborn) and the working of Audrey II is really convincing. And the surprise guests in the film really gives it a 'wow' factor, with John Candy, Bill Murrey and Steve Martin as the manic sadistic dentist, the famous people in it really increases the films greatness The set is brilliant as it seems so realistic to a bum street Sadly the ending doesn't match the show completely but its still good. One of the best I've seen in a long time! Thankyou Mr Oz</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't really care for this movie that much. I think the singing ruined it for me. I do like the idea of the movie, just not as a musical. I think if this movie wasn't a musical, I might have enjoyed it better. What I did like about the movie was its plot, which I thought was original, funny and dark at times. It's a scifi / musical/ dark comedy about a large, carnivorous plant with a mind of its own that begins to take over the life of Seymour, a nerdy flower shop employee. In addition to the plot, I also liked the acting of Rick Moranis. I think he was good as Seymour. I got the sense that if Seymour had just been braver in life, he wouldn't have needed a plant telling him what to do. I also enjoyed the performance of Vincent Gardenia as the flower shop owner. However, I didn't care for Steven Martian in the role of the sadistic dentist. I didn't find him very threatening or convincing. Also I though Ellen Green as Audrey, the object of Seymour's affections, was annoying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular film, a piece of real genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Noting the several comments from people who hated or just didn't "get" this film, I am more convinced than ever that democracy is a rather lame idea since many people are simply too stupid or vapid to deserve a vote. But I digress....I laughed my ass off when I first heard that "Little Shop" was being remade as a musical, and gleefully predicted that it would be an even bigger turd than the musical remake of "Lost Horizon" -- truly one of the most ghastly things that ever soiled a piece of film. I rented the presumed-abominable "Little Shop" musical, invited a few friends over, and we flat fell in love with this movie. None of us are even big fans of musicals; I liked "Carousel" and "Oklahoma," but that's pretty much my complete list of musicals that will bear re-watching. And now this one!Boy, did I ever call this one wrong, and I'm damned glad I did. I've seen it ten or fifteen times, and caught pieces of it another few dozen times while flipping channels. I never tire of it. It's that good.The music is fabulous (as many others have commented), and every piece of casting is perfect. Rick Moranis, who I never thought of as anything other than a competent character actor, does a grand job; he's actually VERY competent and perfect for this role. Surprisingly, he does an amazingly good job of singing (if it was lip-synched, the voice-match was simply perfect). His stock shot up a lot of points with me for this work. His duet work with Ellen Greene (particularly on the operatic "Suddenly Seymour") was superb, though I'll bet he was sorely intimidated to be belting out a duet with someone with the power and range of the incredible Ellen Greene. But he rips right in, carries it off beautifully, and magic happens. There are a lot of tremendous voices in "Little Shop," but "Suddenly Seymour" never fails to bring out the goose bumps for me. How that tiny little woman can shake the walls like that is a great mystery -- my God, what a pair of lungs!Everyone else has sung the praises of Levi Stubbs and Steve Martin, and a raft of other cameo roles, so I'll just say, "Ditto."As I said, I was a big fan of the very dark "original" version, and I never saw the stage play. I've read enough about the "original" ending of this musical (which I won't spoil) to believe that I'd have liked the "original" ending at least as much as the basically "happy" ending we were left with. I'd love to see a DVD with both versions, just to compare.I was perfectly prepared to hate this film, and particularly since I have nothing but disgust for Geffen, personally. However, this has become one of my favorite films of all time -- certainly on my "Top 30" or thereabouts, maybe even "Top 20."</fullReview>

My favorite cameos are by John Candy and Bill Murray both as excellent and fun characters that are good for some serious laughs. The other most fun character is played by Steve Martin in one of his best and most fun roles I've ever seen him in.I can't say that I'm a big fan of all of the songs but still there are some good songs in the movie which makes it a successful and pleasant musical to watch and listen to.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS (1986) ***1/2 Rick Moranis, Ellen Greene, Vincent Gardenia, Steve Martin, Jim Belushi, John Candy, Christopher Guest. Entertaining musical comedy based on the off-Broadway smash inspired by Roger Corman's cult low-budget horror flick "The Little Shop of Horrors" never lets up on energy in this decidedly camp tale about nerd Seymour Krelborn (Moranis in geek mode) the apprentice florist at a skid row floral shop whose hybrid creation of a Venus flytrap grows in more ways than one when it develops a nasty craving for human blood. Very funny and brightly directed by Muppeteer Frank Oz with lots of eye candy and expert detail of 1960 with a creme de la creme cast of comic geniuses. Outstanding especially is Martin as the sadomasochistic dentist a la Elvis and his scene with pain on the brain patient Murray (pricelessly hysterical in the role made famous by a young Jack Nicholson). Great creature visuals of "Audrey II" with voice provided by Four Tops leadman Levi Stubbs. Greene does a memorable turn as the abused heroine Audrey whose best described as Marilyn Monroe and Carol Channing purreed into one; sad sexpot with a lot of spunk and heart. Memorable songs particularly the show stopper "Suddenly Seymour".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as great as the original Corman version, but original in its own way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am usually not a big fan of musicals turned into film (except in the case of films like "Fame" or Busby Berkeley films), but "Little Shop of Horrors" surprised me. I rushed right out and bought the soundtrack! The music is excellent, very tongue-in-cheek, great lyrics, music reminiscent of the 50s (the female chorus members are named after girl groups: Crystal, Ronette, Chiffon), and just fun to listen to.The ensemble cast is one of the best in recent history. Everybody in the film acts in a role tailor-made for them! Rick Moranis as a geek, Ellen Greene as a bubbly blonde, Steve Martin as a cool biker dentist, Bill Murray as a giggling masochist, Vincent Gardenia as a slob flower shop owner, etc.Fans of the original Corman film will be deeply disappointed. Gone is all and any dark humor from that film. I deeply miss the scene where Seymour considers getting a hooker to feed to Audrey II (Seymour: "You're too bony?" Hooker: "Bony? [exposes torso] What do you think this is? Chopped liver?")! But all that is missing is replaced by fun musical numbers, sleazy sets, and a much better Audrey II plant. The musical version ended with Audrey being eaten and Seymour sacrificing himself to the plant, but the movie's ending is made to be happier...sort of...Recommended for everyone, even those who aren't fans of musicals!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In The Little Shop of Horrors, an once orphan boy named Seymore Krelborn was taken in and raised by Mr. Mushnik in exchange for his drudgery at Mr. Mushnik's flower shop.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The grown up Seymore and a woman, Audrey (Ellen Greene), who also works at the flower shop, have secret infatuations with each other. Audrey is in a vituperative relationship with a reckless dentist. Mushnik's flower shop on Skid Row has very lousy business and Mushnik thinks about closing down the shop. As a last resort, Audrey suggests putting in the window some of the exotic plants Seymore has been working on. Seymore brings Mushnik a little plant, called Audrey II, he bought in the plant market during the total eclipse of the sun. He discovers the plant only eats blood. The plant strives and brings the flower shop plenty of business. As the carnivorous plant grows, certain members in the town go missing, one-by-one.I feel like the director's intent for this movie is to explain that enemies can come from anywhere. Enemies surface in the most unlikely and seemingly innocent of places. Deadly threats can be anyone or anything. Seymore finds an amazing plant and once it starts making him rich and famous, he gets carried away with the wealth and popularity. When he realized he needed to take command of the situation, he began fighting for his survival. The musical portions add more emotion to the movie. The setting portrays the time period the action took place in extremely well. The animation of Audrey II, the carnivorous plant from outer space, was done amazingly. It looked pretty realistic. The lip-synching performance given by the plant was life-like as well as entertaining. I also admire the random irony thrown in throughout the film. Although, one thing I believe could make this movie more unpredictable would be if they didn't foreshadow as much in the opening scene. Overall, I personally enjoyed this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully dark bit of fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly, when it comes to my relationship with musicals, we've never gone together like Rama-lama-lama-lama-dingidee-ding-de-dong. Perhaps this was due to a fascination with horror that I possessed in my younger years, but I never found myself sold by the idea of the genre with its exaggerated, happy-go-lucky façade. Regardless, 'Little Shop of Horrors' is, for the most part, an exception.On the surface its the all singing, all dancing bastard cousin of Jim Henson's "The Muppets'. At its core, it's a black comedy with underlying brushes with themes such as domestic violence, drugs, and homicide. It sounds heavy-going for a children's film, right? Wrong, the film has a blatant Broadway flair that keeps things light-hearted and humorous for the duration. The sole element of the film that should be deemed unsuitable for anyone is the abrasive and piercing voice of the lead actress, Ellen Greene. On the other hand, all the performances have these exaggerated, camp qualities that you would expect on a stage show with Steve Martin's sadistic dentistry, Bill Murray's masochistic cameo as a patient and the recognisable, caricature-like facial features of Rick Moranis.Although there was a diverse selection of music, the abundance of song and dance numbers became tiresome at a point. Disregarding this, 'Little Shop of Horrors' is an infectiously fun film that shows all involved having the time of their lives in an ultra-fun, campy depiction of one man's pursuit of the American dream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie changed by screenings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Little shop of Horrors' is a great film which combines successfully different genres such as black comedy, horror, and musical. Comedic performances are outstanding; songs work as both singles and narrative resources, and special effects (puppetry) still stand the test of time (almost making the actual CGI standard look unreal). The director Frank Oz couldn't release a sad ending which took his team a year to film; but now that it's available in digital video, you can't help to wonder why artists in Hollywood can't have their cake and eat it too. Remember the dream sequence in 'Terminator 2'? That was suppose to be the fate of humanity on the film; but characters try to change it and we got a happy ending. Why couldn't the filmmakers of 'Little Shop of horrors' present a false ending (the original sad one); the happy ending (the one that got released), and an ambiguous one as epilogue in the credits to remind us that the sad ending could be real? This is just a modest proposal to exemplify how the tyranny of making everybody happy leads to Hollywood to the same formulas and lack of imagination. A better world is possible (in fiction and the real world). Thanx for reading! See you at the movies!</fullReview>

The music was crazy too, good, but it didn't seem to match the idea of the rest of the film. Also the thing I didn't get in the end when the girlfriend got partially eaten, was that when she got pulled out she had this gaping tooth hole in her side from the plant and she was acting like she was dying. The scene when to a cut, and later turned back to her the hole had disappeared and they lived happily ever after...something is missing?

		<shortDescription>Feed Me, Seymour! Fun Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been a fan of musicals. Although I enjoyed "Annie," "The Wizard of Oz" and other movies of that nature, I always found myself fast-forwarding through the musical numbers to get to the real meat and potatoes of the plot. That's how I felt for the most part watching "Little Shop of Horrors" on Blu-ray for the first time. I did find a few of the songs humorous, but for the most part I found the musical numbers to be a distraction and break from the actual storyline. That's a funny thing to say about a beloved movie based on a hit play but that's how I feel.Seymour works and lives in a plant shop where he eeks out a sad and lonely existence. His work mate is the lovely physically and emotionally abused Audrey. He pines for her day in and day out but never tells her about his true feelings. While shopping one day, Seymour sees an interesting plant he's never encountered before. He buys it and takes it home, only to find out it's a blood-thirsty man-eater. The more it drinks and eats, the bigger it gets. Will Seymour give into its demands to be fed or will he destroy the plant before it gets out of control?I found both the theatrical and Director's Cut to be entertaining. However, the Director's Cut could have five minutes trimmed down from it and still be effective. http://contributor.yahoo.com/user/849014/eric_shirey.html</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this work on stage in - I think - 1983 at the Comedy Theatre in London. It was a surprisingly neglected production and I had no trouble blagging an excellent seat. I thoroughly enjoyed it despite the economy of scale imposed by a stage. Don't recollect who was in it.This movie dates from about 3 years later. It's cast includes the (then)cream of American screen comedy. You could go Ghostbusting and still have something to spare. Which means that production budgets must have been way beyond those of a minor London theatre. Yet the movie left me largely unimpressed. The progressively-engrossing monster plant was much more spectacular on stage. And as everything had to be confined within the remit of a few metres; there was no divergence or excess. As I recollect, the voracious vegetable ate everyone but the chorus-girls in the end.TLSH started out as a theatrical piece, and maybe that's where it belonged. The limits imposed by set changes provided a level of spontaneity that was lost in the smoother but more divergent movie. Also, as stage is a live production, rough spots can be polished and subtle improvements made show-on-show, maintaining freshness &amp; surprise. In this movie, the songs seemed flat and the lyrics less witty and sometimes slurred. The ending also allowed for the hero &amp; heroine to survive, whereas in the play, the monster triumphed and its lethal progeny sold like hot cakes, culminating in a spectacular torrent of green lianas descending from the theatre roof! A great finale that had everyone in stitches.If you didn't see the show, you missed a treat. I'd have given it 8-9 stars. This movie version is a poor substitute.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is the movie called Little Shop of Horrors? There was only one Audrey 2. One horror. Bingo. Anywho, this movie is unfortunately a musical. I say unfortunately because I usually dislike musicals, but this one's numbers were extremely catchy and still pretty entertaining. Even though I don't get the movie at all. The Cameo appearances are better than the quote unquote stars of the movie (my favorite was Bill Murray). It seems that this movie just doesn't have a point to it, a giant talking plant from outerspace? I originally thought this was gonna be a horror movie, until I realized Rick Moranis would be the main role. An off off Broadway production (so this is the cream of the crop, right?) that somehow made it to the big screen. But what can I say, the movie is funny, bizarre, but at the very least memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Lil Shop deserves a shot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll short-cut this: If you think a giant puppet-plant singing funky musical numbers including 'Mean green mother from Outer Space" to a gormless, nerdy Rick Moranis and a ditzy blonde with her nips at '10 and 2' is funny you'll probably get something out of Little Shop of Horrors. If the previous sentence had you reaching for the mouse then perhaps you are better served moving on...Cartoony all the way, Little Shop... is based upon a stage play and directed by a prominent muppetteer Frank Oz. Every 5th line seems an excuse for a lavish musical number, and every bit part is filled with a comedian looking to squeeze every laugh that can be mustered from their precious moments on screen.In sketchy downtown some-city USA (where "depression is status-quo") nerdy and shy plant store assistant Seymour happens upon a magical plant after an eclipse of the sun. Clumsily dubbed Audrey 2, after Audrey the plant arranger that he lusts after, the plant immediately brings the struggling store renown, with customers flocking to see it and the media rushing to talk about it.After the plant gets sick Seymour lucks out with a solution - human blood - initially his own... The plant grows. Thrives even. Thirsts for more.Talks.SINGS! Of course it sings. Why wouldn't it? As Audrey 2 grows Seymour finds fame and renown, but as the plant continues to grow unabated on a diet of... other, demanding more and more, desperate measures are required.Little Shop of Horrors is a musical even though Rick Moranis can't sing (be he damn sure gives it his best) and Steve Martin can't sing (but he damn sure is funny).Cameos abound also, notably the afore-mentioned Martin as a sadistic, violent and mysogenist dentist who steals the film in a quarter of an hour. Bill Murray also gets laughs as a patient who longs to be ill-treated, John Candy is a Radio DJ and James Belushi is an obnoxious, opportunistic businessman.Back to the plant; it seems odd that a film featuring an otherworldly creature in plant form that finds sustenance from blood and flesh might not be the central part of the film, but Audrey 2 really isn't. The core of Lil Shop is the fun, frequent and above all spontaneous songs that populate the flick. Homeless people become back-up dancers, random passers by guest vocalists and three black women show up time and again to sing the plot forward.The lyrics are at times quite dark if you think about them, and sound nice and funky if you don't... (As an aside friends of mine had a song highlighted at their wedding reception where the lyrics referred to suicidal thoughts. We don't always listen carefully enough.)... but all in all Little Shop of Horrors is a an enjoyably lunatic film, with catchy songs, let it all hang out performances and eye-catching - but more importantly - funny cameos that propel the film. I remember it was funny and original in the 80s, and damn if it isn't worth a look now.Final Rating - 7.5 / 10. Possibly the best singing-talking-alien-plant film musical/comedy since... I can't think. I'm too dizzy from all the hyphens and slashes. Give Lil Shop a shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A black comedy musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fewer genres are likely to mix successfully than the black comedy and the musical. By their nature, the former is borderline unpleasant while the latter is upbeat and fun. But here it is, the unexpected Off-Broadway success that mixes these two opposing genres. And while time hasn't been good to it, it's still irreverent enough to be 90 minutes of fun, if of a bizarre sort.Seymour Krelborn (Rick Moranis) is a lonely man working at a flower shop for Mr. Mushnik (Vincent Gardenia). Seymour's life is in a slump; he longs for his co-worker, the beautiful Audrey (Ellen Greene) and the shop is going under. However, his luck turns when he finds a new plant, which he calls Audrey II. Suddenly life is looking up, until Audrey II reveals its bloody eating habits."Little Shop of Horrors" lives up to its name. The film deals with such things as sadism, masochism, axe murders, and a carnivorous plant. None of this is remotely frightening, however. Director Frank Oz keeps the tone so irreverent that it's impossible not to laugh at the over-the-topness of it all. In fact, "horror" isn't the best word to describe this movie. "Bizarre" is a more apt description.The cast is first rate. Rick Moranis has made a career out of playing perpetual nerds, and that's what he does here. However, this is easily his most accomplished performance, and while Seymour is nerdy, he's also a tragic figure and not a usual Moranis-ish buffoon. His co-star, Ellen Greene, is wholly successful as the helium-voiced and bubble brained Audrey (I was reminded of Frenchie in "Grease"). This isn't as surprising; Greene pioneered the role in its original off-Broadway show. Cameos by Steve Martin, as a sadistic dentist (who acts like an Elvis impersonator) and Bill Murray as a masochistic patient. And of course, Levi Stubbs shines as the singing plant, Audrey II.Sometimes time eats away at the quality of material. What was side-splittingly funny 25 yeas ago is merely amusing today. This is the case with "Little Shop of Horrors." Although it's still irreverent and strange enough to be enjoyable, the over-the-top antics of Steve Martin and Bill Murray are unlikely to elicit belly laughs (grins and perhaps chuckles are guaranteed, however).It takes a sure hand to create something this strange and keep its mainstream appeal. Indeed, the play's original ending was vilified by test audiences, so Oz had to throw away the 2 million dollar original ending and film a new one. Surprisingly, it works. The set design is impeccable; it feels like a Broadway stage come to life. Actually, the only complaint I have is that near the 1 hour mark there's an awkward cut.It ain't perfect, but "Little Shop of Horrors" is a bizarre bit of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Argument over who sings the part of the old woman in Downtown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am having an argument over who sings the part of the old woman in the song "Downtown." I know that Bernice Reading played the role but, according to the soundtrack listing, it is Michelle Weeks who doubled for her singing. Bernice has a long history of singing and it had to have been humiliating for her voice to be replaced. Michelle is more of a featured player so it would not be amazing if they preferred her rendition to a singing featured extra. Perhaps unjust but there are plenty of instances where such decisions have been made ever since sound came in. I also think that people who don't see the satire in this movie and Oz's direction could be victims of a generation gap because it's the early Sixties that is being spoofed as well as the obvious take-off of Grade Z horror movies and musicals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was quite young when I watched this film for the first time and it freaked me out. I didn't find it funny, and when the dentist dies I thought it was creepy. But after I watched it I realised how I couldn't stop humming the songs. Recently I bought the soundtrack, then had to buy the film itself. And it's just so good. Audrey II has to be the best film puppet ever. Yeah you've got Yoda and other legendary puppets but none have the matching lip movements. Those lips continue to amaze me! Audrey II looks amazing and sounds fantastic, Rick Moranis was made for Seymour, I could go on. If you've seen this film and later didn't find yourself any of the songs, (especially "Feed Me" and "Mean Green Mother From Outer Space") there's got to be something wrong with you. If you want an evening filled with laughs, amazing songs and an alien blood sucking plant this is the film for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Met My Expectations, But For Those Who Know the Plays Ending, It's Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS: This is a great movie, don't get me wrong, the acting is great, the special effects are excellent, the songs are memorable, and the storyline doesn't go all over the place like that dentist. But for those who know the play, most will be kind of disappointed with the 'happy ending' instead of the play (or if one could call the 1960 version having this kind of ending) a 'dark ending' (where the plants take-over and one learns the danger of greed.) But enough nagging about the ending, lets go onto acting, the acting was spot-on (even if the only person from the stage musical to be on here was Ellen Greene) Rick Moranis is, also, at the best he could do (which is quite good, actually.) So all in all this is a great movie. Good songs, good singing, good instrumentals, that's all it takes to make a musical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Screwball musical is a laugh riot...Rick Moranis screamingly funny...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS, from the Broadway musical of the same name, is a stylized, very funny comedy about a man-eating plant that thrives on eating flesh whenever it can. Rick Moranis is Seymour Krelborn, the nerd who works in a florist shop and is enamored of the shop assistant, Audrey--so much so, that he names the plant Audrey II after her. But little does he know that the plant is really an alien from outer space out to settle a score with the world.There are a few catchy songs that are entirely in keeping with the zany plot and all of them are performed with wit and style by a talented cast. And then we come to STEVE MARTIN as "the dentist from hell" who can't wait to yank out teeth with fiendish delight and sadistic glee. His scenes are all a bit over the top, but it doesn't matter--so is the whole concept of the film while at the same time managing to be screamingly funny.If your funnybone doesn't react to this kind of material, skip it. Otherwise, it's a treat just watching the interaction between nasal-voiced Seymour and Audrey II.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On stage, Alan Menken and Howard Ashman's musical is a riot, funny, sharp, and with great songs. The plant Audrey II usually steals the show and quite rightly.Here, in the film version by Frank Oz, the story comes across well (although some songs have been excised and the ending is different). The best thing about the film is the retention of the stage Audrey, Ellen Greene, recreating the role for the big screen. Her interpretation of the dumb blonde is perfect.Rick Moranis as Seymour is also very good, as is Steve Martin as the sadistic dentist with an Elvis complex. The voice of Audrey II is provided by Levi Stubbs who embodies pure evil with his versions of 'Feed Me' and 'Suppertime'.The setting of Skid Row is the backdrop for a love story including plants, Doo-Wop singers, a trio of Supreme-like ladies who first appear singing in the driving rain, and amusing cameos from the likes of Christopher Guest, James Belushi, and Bill Murray.Much better than I expected, this film rivals the Rocky Horror Picture Show and Phantom of the Paradise for sheer kooky strangeness, and is well worth watching. Based on the cut-price Corman cult classic, this is a fun addition to movie musicals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Little shop of horrors is about a flower shop attendant (Rick Moranis / Seymour Krelborn) who finds an alien species which grows only when fed blood, basically like a Venus fly trap but with the ability to talk (and sing) and prefers humans over normal plant food with hilarious consequences. The plant (Levi Stubbs / Audrey II) introduces new life to the flower shop bringing big business and fame to Seymour. Semour has low self esteem but is in love with Audrey (Ellen Greene) which leads to some funny and inspiring acts. In the end it is worth watching, especially if you like a good musical ... or a comedy. Cheesy ending with a nice twist right at the end, perfectly in tune with the rest of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know what the masses who vote on this movie are thinking. This movie blows it at the end. Changing the ending of the movie was a huge mistake, but Hollytwood loves the happy ending. this movie is great regardless of the not so stellar ending. Rick Moranis seems like he was put on this earth to play the uncool, nerdy, dirty, poor, but lovable hero. I have seen two different versions of this show on stage , and I have never seen a dentist played any better than the one played by Steve Martin. I personally think that Steve Martin is one of the most underrated actors of any generation, and it is because he plays goofy and unrealistic characters like Orin the dentist. He pulls this off very well, and his death scene is one of the funniest things I have ever seen. Also funny in this movie is a small cameo by Bill Murrey. He is a patient of the dentist and loves the pain that Orin is inflicting on him. That is another classically funny scene between two great comedians.</fullReview>

I love it too death because of all the humor and singing (since I love musicals). Mainly all the story is about is an average guy who is in love with a girl but is dating the sleazy boyfriend. He owns a plant that is from outer space and they compromise in a deal to make Seymour famous and the plant (Audry 2) well fed. But there's more to the story than just a plant from outer space. It's a romance and a tragedy to the greater good of mankind. I especially love the three girls. The singers. Without them this wouldn't even be a good movie. With there sisterly act and hip hop soul they make the movie even better. I love them for that. I totally recommend this movie to watch with your loved ones and laugh and cry at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the tradition of "stupid films with music in them", Little Shop of Horrors offers a great cast, a wonderfully senseless story of a man-eating plant called Audrey II, and stuck-in-the-head music which will make you sing "Feed Me Seymour" on the street every now and then. Unlike any other musical of the 80s, LSoH combines great sound with some amount of self irony. Why do we start singing now? Well, whatever, who cares? As far as I know, no other musical movie has had this certain attitude in it, except for the Rocky Horror Picture Show by Richard O'Brien. And in fact, it seems adequate to name both film creations in this comment. Although LSoH is slightly less senseless and bears a bit more heart warmth, it still makes up to all the expectations of those who like the rather "weird movie". A classic and not only that. And be prepared to go singing on the street for a while!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie! It's one of my favorite movie musicals along with The Wizard of Oz and Oliver, and one of my favorite movies period. It's a hard movie to categorize. It's part musical, part black comedy, part send up of horror films from the 60's, part horror/sci fi, and part romance. The story-narrated by a Greek chorus- concerns a nerdy but good hearted flower shop clerk named Seymour who cares for a mysterious plant and then finds himself in a moral pickle when he discovers what it lives on. Everything about this movie is top notch. The acting is awesome featuring: Rick Moranis (absolutely wonderful as Seymour-and who knew he could sing so well?), Vincent Gardenia, Levi Stubbs, the hilarious Steve Martin, and Ellen Greene, both funny and moving as Seymour's love interest, Audrey. The film also features an array of cameos with John Candy, James Belushi, Christopher Guest and Bill Murray, all great in their roles. The music is amazing as well, and was written by Howard Ashman and Alan Mencken who would go on to pen the songs for The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast. Little Shop is a great movie, the kind you can watch over and over, and always find funny and hugely entertaining.</fullReview>

Steve Martin previews the demented dentist later perfected in Novocaine. Ellen Greene is fetching, unrecognizable from the L A Law window dressing. Rick Moranis as Seymour is perfect casting.The joyful amorality of the film hit a wrong note for me- using musical theater mixed with horror was off. Rocky Horror could overcome this by being outrageous camp, rewriting the rules. Lil Shop hews a bit too close to straight romantic musical to totally succeed. despite this, overall it is great horrid fun. Just not for the weak of stomach or rigid of morals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Spoilers included) You take the famous Broadway and Hollywood song writers Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, a poorly made monster movie in the 60s about a man-eating plant, Rick Moranis, Steve Martin, and the silky, toe tapping voice of Levi Stubbs and what do you get? Why probably one of the best musicals since Fiddler on the Roof. Little Shop of Horrors is the story about a skid row flower shop that needed a miracle. When one of the shop's employees Seymour Kreylborne finds a strange and interesting breed of fly trap at a Chinese man's flower shop, this little flower attracts so many customers that the store now needs two cash registers. Everyday the customers come in and everyday Seymour's plant Audrey II (Named after his secret love) grows bigger. What's Seymour's secret to his success? The plant survives on blood! Seymour and the evil plant make a cryptic deal that if Seymour feeds it human blood, the plant will supply him with fame, money and the girl of his dreams. But what Audrey II is really planning could be the end of the world as we know it. For anyone who needs a good laugh, a little song in their life and some pretty creepy stuff, I suggest you go down to the nearest video store and rent or buy (which I strongly suggest) the horrific, comedic, musical known as Little Shop of Horrors.</fullReview>

Plus, Ellen Greene as 'Audrey' is one of the only (if not the only) cast member to make the jump from stage to screen - and what a set of pipes she's got! Rick Moranis makes a great little Seymour - he always does well as a little pip squeek. The major stealer of the movie - without a doubt, is Steve Martin as Dr. Scrivello - the Dentist with a twist. Many other comedic actors make stupendous cameos - John Candy, Bill Murray, and more - as well as the musical cameos made - especially 3 girls - all with great pipes, too! And one of the Motown greats as the voice of Audrey II! GREAT!You've all read the premise and the plot. You know what goes on, so I won't wreck it for you. Just rent it or buy it for the fun, the frivolity and the fashion! Plus, doesn't it just make ya glad that you got 'outta Skid Row'?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gotta love this movie -- nothing earthshaking, but pure viewing pleasure and ridiculously hummable. (How I wish they'd kept the original, darker ending; hands-down cult classic.) And I know just how Mr. Anderson, above, feels about having one particular moment that just makes the movie for him. I feel exactly the same about this split-second little... hop? jig?... that Steve Martin executes near the end of his "Dentist" number. Utterly blissful (yeah, Steve and me both). And what's not to like about a movie that posits everyman Rick Moranis as a romantic lead?! It's interesting to remember that this and Platoon (Big Important Message Movie) came out the same year. Does anyone still care about Platoon? Don't discount the appeal of fluff. It's more enduring than you'd suppose.</fullReview>

Steve Martin is fantastic - if you don't hire it for any other reason, hire it for his Dentist song. It's one of my favourite songs ever! I could list the things great about the film, but its one of those films where everything about it sounds so daft written down, so here are your orders people: abandon all prejudices and reservations and hire it immediantly.

		<fullReview>Little Shop of Horrors is a comedy musical which is entertaining almost from beginning to end. Rick Moranis is fantastic here and there is Steve Martin/Bill Murray dentist scene which many people feel it is worth watching the film for. The comedy may not have you laughing out loud very much but it should keep you smiling all the way through. Most of the songs are used to develop the plot rather than interrupt it, and by the end of the film you might be left with the optimism that almost anybody could be a hero if they had to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best musicals of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1986 version of 'Little Shop Of Horrors' holds a very special place in my heart. It was one of the first films I viewed in the theater. My parents took me to it when I was five years old, and I remember loving every minute of it. Back then, and even still today, I find that director Frank Oz perfectly mixed a musical with retro sci-fi and created this quirky masterpiece, based on Roger Corman's 1960 original of the same name and the stage musical. And with this blu-ray release, it still proves that after 26 years, 'Little Shop of Horrors' is an inspiring and highly entertaining film. Not to mention, that finally we get the rare never-before-released 20 minute original ending.'Little Shop of Horrors' centers around a shy and nerdy orphan named Seymour Krelborn (Rick Moranis), who was taken in by Mr. Mushnick (Vincent Gardenia), a local florist, when he was a kid. Seymour has spent his life living in the basement of Mr. Mushnik's shop and working for him. The only other employee at Mr Mushnik's plant shop is Audrey (Ellen Greene), a busty, beautiful blonde, whom with Seymour is secretly in love with. Although Audrey does dream about a life with Seymour outside of the plant shop and city, she does not share her feelings with him, for fear of her cruel and insane dentist boyfriend, Orin Scrivello (Steve Martin).However, Seymour's life is forever changed during a total eclipse of the sun, when a strange and interesting plant appears out of thin air at a rival local plant shop. Seymour purchases the bizarre looking plant in hopes to attract business to Mr. Mushnick's decaying shop. Instantly, people take notice of the plant and start doing business at Mr. Mushnik's shop, but at a life- threatening cost. The plant, which Seymour names Audrey II, only feeds on human blood. So days turn into weeks, and weeks turn into months where Seymour drains his blood on a daily basis to feed Audrey II. Since Seymour is so good about feeding Audrey II, the plant grows to an enormous size, thus needing more blood. Soon, Audrey II is speaking fluently and requesting that Seymour kill people so it can eat. It is soon revealed the true intentions of the plant, which prompts Seymour to take serious action.I'm so glad that fans of the film will finally get to see the original ending to this film. The ending we all saw in the theaters and on the last DVD release ends on a high note, however the ending originally intended, which was the ending in the stage version is a bit on the more grim side of things. This ending was approved by the studio, but test audiences were upset with it, so they canned the ending and made the new one that we have seen since 1986.Frank Oz did a perfect casting job on this film. Rick Moranis is amazing as Seymour. He brings his wit and nerdy charm to every second of the film, and who knew that Moranis could sing. Ellen Greene played Audrey in the stage version for a number of years, so it was a no-brainer that her impact on this character could not be matched. And her and Moranis's chemistry is incredible. And of course Steve Martin is the scene stealer as the bad guy dentist. He's funny and sadistic at the same time. Not too mention that Bill Murray, John Candy, James Belushi, Christopher Guest, Tichina Arnold, and Tisha Campbell all have cameos in the film.Then there is the ultimate star of the film, Audrey II. The plant is a milestone in special effects, puppetry, and animatronics in filmmaking. I still think Audrey II looks just as good if not better than any CG work done in film. That's right. Audrey II was 100% real, meaning there were no CG effects done on the plant. It took at the most 60 people to operate one of the Audrey II's, which made the plant's movement smooth, fluid, and very life-like. In the commentary, Oz says that the scenes with the large plant were filmed at 16 frames per second. Films are usually shot at the normal 24 frames per second, meaning that the human actors had to act in slow motion when doing scenes with the plant. When the 16 frames per second were played back at normal speed, you cannot tell that the slow motion acting was done, which means that every actor and special effects supervisor and technician were doing their job perfectly.The music in the film is some of my favorite music in a musical film. It's part 50's and part rock n' roll. Every actor's step and cue is done in sync with the music and it is all very catchy and will have you, well at least me singing the tunes for days after watching the film. This 1986 version of 'Little Shop of Horrors' is a perfect example of the remake being better than the original. When you have top notch talent, great music, great dialogue, and the best special effects crew of the time working together, you get the masterpiece that is 'Little Shop of Horrors'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seymour Krelborn (Rick Moranis) is a bumbling worker at Mr. Mushnik (Vincent Gardenia)'s flower shop on Skid Row. His co-worker Audrey Fulquard (Ellen Greene) gets beaten by her semi-sadist dentist boyfriend Orin Scrivello (Steve Martin). They both want to leave Skid Row. During the total eclipse of the sun, a strange plant appear out of the sky. Seymour and Audrey figure a strange plant at the window would bring in business and it does. Seymour calls it Audrey II. The plant has a need for blood. It demands blood and in return, it promises to bring good fortune to Seymour.This is a lot crazy wacky overblown Broadway music. It's fun for the most part. Steve Martin goes over the top. The craziness doesn't get that many laughs. Some of the songs are catchy. It's a fun musical but not many big laughs. Bill Murray as Arthur Denton should have been funnier but like a lot of the movie, he's a crazy character and the movie assumes that he's funny just because it's wacky.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very fun movie version of the hit musical, which itself was based off of Roger Corman's 1960 camp classic. Although I like both movies I prefer this one. The humor is great. The nostalgia parody stuff is very cute. The songs are catchy and memorable. The cast is terrific. Rick Moranis is immensely likable. Ellen Greene pretty much steals the movie. She's perfectly cast as Audrey, a part she also played on stage. The singing trio (Tisha Campbell, Tichina Arnold, Michelle Weeks) is one of my favorite parts. I felt like they were missing too much from the second half of the movie. That's one of the few complaints I have. Steve Martin, Bill Murray, Vincent Gardenia, John Candy, and Christopher Guest all have funny roles. Frank Oz does a good job directing. He's no stranger to working with puppets and the Audrey II puppets here are impressive and cool. Levi Stubbs provides the voice for Audrey II and seems to be having a great time with the role. This is a fun musical horror-comedy that just about everybody should enjoy on some level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fans of Fraggle Rock and Sesame Street will see a very familiar creative streak and aesthetic in this wild, eccentric 1986 sci-fi/musical/horror. Though very different from his previous films The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth, Frank Oz (when not voicing Kermit or planting cellophane bags of Angel Dust on Dan Aykroyd) does seem right at home and the perfect choice to direct this movie of a giant hungry plant gone mad.Nerdy florist Seymore Krelborn (Rick Moranis) encourages his boss to display a bizarre new plant, the Audrey II, in the shop window in order to entice more customers into their failing business. The plan works, and as Audrey II grows larger so does their fame. But Audrey demands to be fed, and blood and human meat are at the top of the preferred menu, as so, in a sort-of botanist version of Hellraiser Seymore arranges to keep Audrey II fed with people who deserve to die.Little does he know that Audrey II actually has plans for world domination and is merely using him as a naive puppet. Many musical numbers and cameos later (from John Candy, Bill Murray, and Steve Martin) the film forks into two different endings, depending on what version your watching. The theatrical cut, which I never really liked, gives us a happy ending that was shot merely to appease a fickle test audience (insert groans and rolling eyes here) while the extended ending of Frank Oz's director's cut is more epic, darker, crazier, and feels like a more natural homage to creature features of the 1950s such as Godzilla or Creature from the Black Lagoon. I can't believe this ending was ditched and not seen for over 25 years.Little Shop of Horrors deserves and enduring popularity and if you watch it I insist on the director's cut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>10 reasons why you should, no, you must watch "Little Shop of Horrors" ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1/ "Little Shop of Horrors" screams "80's" in every single frame, whether it's a scream of terror, of orgasmic delight under a shrill dentist-drill, a scream of shock or a scream of rock ? "Little Shop of Horrors" concentrates in one hour and half, everything that made the zany and delirious 80's such a marvelous decade as far as comedic film-making is concerned. Hell, you can point a gun at my head, or make me feed 'Audrey II", I'll never say anything wrong about a film that reunites John Candy, Steve Martin, Bill Murray and James Belushi, a film that has Christopher as a Guest star and Rick Moranis as the central hero! And speaking of Moranis ?2/ The 'Krelborn' ? especially if you're a fan of "Malcolm in the Middle" like I am, you'll discover the inspiration, the ultimate nerdish hero with a heart of gold, who only wanted to be loved by the girl of his dreams and gain enough fame and money to please her, and for that turned into the unlikely creator, and something of a father, of a devilish man-eating plant. The sympathetic florist is so dedicated and well-meaning he even wanted to feed her with nicks of blood coming from his own finger until he almost ran off it. As the Yin to a Yang incarnated by Tim Curry, no actor will touch your heart like Rick Moranis.And speaking of heart ? 3/ That "Little Shop" is a magnificent demonstration of how genre-bending formulas can provide some great stories. For all the horror and music the film features, there is an irresistible touch of sweetness in the on-going romance between Krelborne and Audrey, the first one, played by Ellen Greene, two misunderstood hearts who belong one another and yet don't have the strength to overcome their own fears. One is so self-diluted he can't believe in his own appeal, and another, so terrified of her sadistic husband she'll never have the guts to make the move and leave him!Speaking of the husband ? 4/ Steve Martin stars in one of his greatest roles, too short for the film, but talk about a scene-stealing performance. Martin is the macho leather-clad motorcycle-driving wife-beating rocker of a husband, he can't help it, it's his nature but what a magnificent twist when we learn that his profession is dentist, and when we accept it as an evidence, the sadistic number he displays while singing "I'm a dentist" is catchy, funny, disturbing and God, I knew there was some evil impulses in that gloomy, and not misunderstood at all, part of the medical world, the worst you can wish to him is to have a client like ? 5/ Bill Murray (I got tired, with these 'speaking of', you knew where I was going at) .. Murray is on-screen for less than 5 minutes but this is the mark of a great comic actor to impact viewers with the tiniest role. His frenetic S&amp;M exchange with Martin, the way, he's literally melting of pleasure while receiving the treatment, is perhaps one of the funniest sequences of the 80's, the way the film turned violence, sex, lust into spectacular humor is something I never thought was possible, not since Tommy's sadistic Cousin Kevin and Uncle Ernie in another classic rock musical.And speaking of violence? 6/ Well, there still is the plant, the real star of the film, voiced by Four Tops singer, the late Levi Stubbs. The flytrap-like monster acts like the devoted protégé brilliantly masterminding Krelborne's naivety to make his world-dominating scheme possible. And it's not just the plant, but the bad-ass coolness it exudes, the way it talks, the "feed me", which makes it not just a super-looking, supra-monstrous, larger-than-life villain but a character on its own, we do believe it's a real thing here, hell no wonder, it was designed by Jim Henson and directed by Frank Oz, so the spectacle is still here. Except that for once, it's the creature that pulls the strings.Speaking of the spectacle? 7/ There are the special effects, of course, but no more special than the effect the music has on you. From the catchy opening of "Little Shop of Horrors" to the poignant "Skid Row", there's a genuine quality in the film's songs that gets you totally obsessed with it, as if you wanted the 80's to go back, I don't know if it's about the Greek chorus featuring the three singers, the lyrics, the way the music makes one with the story and never feels dull or forced but I can't get the music out of mind, it's definitely one of the greatest rock musicals and maybe musicals of the last 30 years.8/ And there's this nostalgic feeling, the fact that the film is set in the 60's (the same era of the original) makes the 80's eternally connected with the sweet 60's, now, the 80's are our own oldies, conveying the same innocence, the same notions of pleasure and fun. And that's exactly what you've got in "Little Shop of Horrors" the joy of a successful Broadway musical gracing the silver screen, as a great entertainment and piece of film-making.9/ And the film doesn't take itself seriously but deals with the story with originality and consideration for every generation, it's definitely pure family entertainment, with enough horror to please thrills-hungry movie-goers, enough romance to make some hearts 'oww' enough fun to please everybody. And how about the fact that a flower-themed film (so rare in that cynical industry) features an actor named Gardenia! I guess the 10th reason works as a combination of all the parameters I described. Now, if you excuse me, I have a song to listen to ? "Little Shop ? Little Shop of Horrors, Little Shop, Little Shoppa Terror"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is my belief that a movie's first and most important function is to entertain. It may contain messages, opinions or whatever, but if it fails to entertain, then it fails as a film. The Little Shop of Horrors entertains. It is entertaining on every level making it just about a perfect film in my opinion. The late Vincent Gardenia (what an appropriate name) is the perfect flower shop owner in a failing business somehow still trying to survive in the very worst slummy part of the city. Everything about this film is perfect. The set decorations, the chorus in the background, the array of colorful characters with cameos by Steve Martin, Bill Murray, James Belushi (or Paul Dooley) and the chameleon- like Christopher Guest. Ellen Greene is absolutely so perfect in her role as the lovely but a bit whacko assistant and Rick Moranis is the nerd of the year, of many years. This is a film I can (and do) watch whenever it turns up on TV. I own a copy too, just in case I get that sudden urge to listen to The Urchins again. As to the critic who complained that, during his dream sequence, Seymour is mowing his lawn but the grass remains the same. It was fantasy dream, fellow!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun, over the top musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A 1986 musical film based on the 1982 musical based on the original 1960 film?Yeah, it's based off some stuff. I have no knowledge about the original film or the musical but I certainly had a fun time watching this one. As a prerequisite, I typically do not enjoy musicals, I've only enjoyed a handful, (classic Disney films, Singin' in the Rain, The Muppets, etc.) most of them I don't like due to the fact that when they break into song it feels so out of place or weird. Rather, in this film, it compliments the silliness of the film with its over the top acting that provides most of them comedic moments in the film. The film follows Rick Moranis' character, Seymour, who works in a plant shop where he has worked almost all his life after being taken in by Vincent Gardenia's character, Mr. Mushnik. The other employee at the plant shop is played by Ellen Greene with her character Audrey. Seymour has always liked Audrey but unfortunate for him, she has a boyfriend hilariously played by Steve Martin named Orin who is a dentist. Martin provides some of the best laughs from the film with his ridiculous music number.One day, Seymour brings a plant in that appeared one day during a strange eclipse while he was shopping for plants, he brings this strange plant and it instantly brings in customers that the store desperately needed. Little does everyone know, is that the plant isn't exactly the most normal thing and this leads to a turmoil of events with Audrey II (the plant) named after Audrey by Seymour. Rick Moranis definitely helps carry the film with his charming performance and the film is loaded with great comedic cameos by some of the best around at the time. The film has beautiful and simplistic set design with a city that obviously looks like a back lot, but it doesn't matter because it still provides an extra charm to the film due to the design. Regardless of how silly the movie is, it still manages to have some heart and you do care about the two leads. The musical numbers are fun and interesting albeit a bit overbearing at times. In general, the film is a fun time that provides a great and over the top experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What looks like a bad movie on paper turns out to be a favorite of mine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Episode #5 of Lionheart490's IMDb Movie Reviews It has been about 3 years since I last made an IMDb review and I've decided to return to posting reviews on this site. For my return to writing text reviews on movies, I've decided give my opinion on an underrated 80's comedy tragedy parody movie musical starring a talking plant who has a taste for murder. This is my review of the cult-classic, "Little Shop of Horrors".I just can't believe how much I absolutely love this movie. Nearly every aspect of this film that could possibly be done right is done absolutely right. This is all the more surprising considering how awful the movie sounds on paper. It is a cheesy dark comedy musical that parodies B-Movies while acting like a Greek tragedy. It was based on a campy Roger Corman movie that was made in only two days which was later adapted into an Off-Broadway musical which then got adapted into this movie. And did I forget to mention the giant singing alien plant who has a craving for humans. Yes, this sounds the making of an awful film... and yet it turns out to be an absolute favorite of mine. Despite how campy and cheesy this movie sounds, I do recommend you check this film out because it is just a wonderful movie that I just love watching again and again without getting sick of it. Nearly everybody about this movie was masterfully done. It has performances from people like Rick Moranis, Ellen Greene, and Steve Martin who are just great in their roles, can be very hilarious, and often-times provide some very good singing. We are really able to see the dirty, disgusting, and depressing streets of Skid Row pop out of the screen. The special effects for Audrey II are just phenomenal and along with Levi Stubb's great performance, you really do believe there is a real giant singing plant in the room. The movie is able to mix in all kinds of different things from different genres without it being a tangled mess of a film. The movie can be comedic, tragic, campy, dramatic, and fun yet still have an enjoyable tone that stays throughout the film which is an impressive feat. And remember this is a musical and I have to say I absolutely loved the songs in this movie. My favorite songs in the movie are "Suddenly Seymour" and "Mean Green Mother from Outer Space". However, I think all the songs in the film are very catchy and enjoyable to listen to. Nearly everything in this movie was absolutely perfect.Overall, I think "Little Shop of Horrors" is an amazing movie. The movie does nearly everything right to provide a unique, memorable, and enjoyable experience that you can laugh, cry, and hum along to. It is one of my favorite movies of all time. Honestly, I cannot say anything really bad about the movie and I truly recommend anyone to check this film out. It is certainly a cinematic experience that you will never forget. I give this movie a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, although near perfect, epitomises what I would say to be a heady cocktail of what I loved about the eighties. Frank Oz, a Muppet creator and star, has never really received full recognition outside of his die-hard fans (recognition he often betrays he does not want) in the arena of serious movie critique (which he solely desires, even though he is as a god to fans of felt puppets and foam latex goblins)Here, he shows only he could have made a giant foam latex monster orchid be menacingly cool. He reunites with Saturday Night Live alumni (He and Henson did adult muppet sketches on the first series of SNL) to create that delicious synergy of comedy and sci fi horror geekery that added that special MSG to 'Ghostbusters' and 'Gremlins'.It is hard to define and I'm meandering here, but Oz could have been far more great and powerful of he didn't shrink from mention of the Muppets and Yoda in every TV interview and had pursued more comic fantasy in the 'Little Shop' style.</fullReview>

He plays an employee of an unsuccessful flower shop. After an eclipse, he finds a strange and interesting plant that he has never seen before. The plants diet: blood. This film, which was based on a Broadway musical, which was inspired by a non-musical movies, has its ups and downs. Ups: Steve Martin as the sadistic, almost-Joker like, boyfriend of Audrey. And the cameo appearances by Bill Murray and John Candy were amusing. But other than that, I didn't find the movie as entertaining or funny as I hoped. The ending was less than satisfactory. Now, I have read that there are two endings: the original "happy" ending (the one I saw), or the intended Director's Cut that was finally just recently released on Blu- Ray, which I am quite interested in seeing. Perhaps watching the other would change my opinion of the film. I sure hope so. All in all, it wasn't horrible, but it could have been better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 1986 musical version of the classic black and white comedy "Little Shop of Horrors" is actually a great re-make and a re-invention of the classic movie. And it has been spiced up with some snappy and snazzy musical songs and dances. Sure it is no "The Rocky Horror Picture Show", but it is quite entertaining nonetheless.If you have seen the 1960 version, then you basically have seen this 1986 version as well, though of course, this version is a musical whereas the original version was not. And if you enjoyed the 1960 version, then chances are very likely that you will enjoy this 1986 version as well. Personally, I think the musical aspect of this version actually worked out quite well, adding a whole new dimension to the movie, and it worked out nicely.And they actually had some rather great names to the cast list. There is, of course, Rick Moranis (playing Seymour Krelborn), Vincent Gardenia (playing Mushnik), and some nice appearances by Steve Martin (playing Orin Scrivello), Bill Murray (playing Arthur Denton), John Candy (playing Wink Wilkinson) and James Belushi (playing Patrick Martin)."Little Shop of Horrors" is a nice black comedy that stays true to the original version, even though it is spiced up with dancing, music and singing.And a great deal of the success of this movie, the reason for why it worked out so nicely is, of course, because of Frank Oz's unique and fantastic ability to create puppets and make them come to life and seem lifelike and real. The plant, Audrey II, was really nicely made and was a treat, both visually and audibly.Despite it being from 1986, it still is loads of fun and great entertainment to watch even today. It is one of those timeless classics, just like "The Rocky Horror Picture Show"; you never tire of it no matter how many times you've seen it.If you enjoy musicals and comedies, then you should be familiar with "Little Shop of Horrors" already. If not, well, what are you waiting for?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trashy, silly, but undeniably fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the off-Broadway musical by Howard Ashman, which was based on Roger Corman's 1960 film that was apparently shot in two days, Little Shop of Horrors sees lonely plant shop worker Seymour Krelborn (Rick Moranis) discovers a strange venus fly-trap-alike plant while wandering uptown. With the shop failing and facing a possible sacking from owner Mushnik (Vincent Gardenia), Seymour tries the plant in the shop window to instant success. He names the plant Audrey II, a dedication to his squeaky-voiced love Audrey (Ellen Greene) who is in an abusive relationship with sadistic dentist Orin (Steve Martin). Not knowing how to feed his new sensation, Seymour accidentally cuts his finger one day, and discovers that Audrey II has a lust for blood. With his fingers drying up, and Audrey II becoming bigger every day, Seymour must resort to other means to find fresh blood.Like most straight men of my age, I don't tend to warm to musicals. There are, of course, some greats in the genre - Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933), Singin' in the Rain (1952), West Side Story (1959) - but I usually find them to be three hours of singing and dancing based around a simple concept or plot. The genre has seen its fair share of oddball productions, and Little Shop of Horrors is one of these - one part a lovable homage to B-movies and the work of the likes of Roger Corman, and one part an impressive musical, featuring some very catchy numbers and staying true to the ideals and traditions of the genre. The film is also surprisingly (and therefore pleasantly) dark, featuring axe mutilation, domestic violence, dental torture, and a sadomasochistic patient.Of all the cameos that pop up, Bill Murray's (as you would expect) is the most memorable. Taking over from Jack Nicholson's baby-faced role in Corman's original, he becomes visibly sexually aroused while Orin ploughs through his draw of many horrific-looking dental instruments to create a hilarious and quite edgy scene, given its PG rating. John Candy, James Belushi (taking over from an unfortunately axed Paul Dooley after the climax had to be-shot due to negative test screenings while Dooley was unavailable), and Christopher Guest are less successful. But Steve Martin manages to steal the film even from the fantastic Levi Stubbs, who voices Audrey II, playing the ridiculously over-the-top, motorbike-riding, gas-addicted Orin, whose musical number is the best in the film (the part in which he punches the nurse in the face had me giggling). It's a nice reminder of how Martin used to be one the most watchable comedians of his day. This is the Martin of The Man With two Brains (1983) and Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid (1982), before he became the go-to guy for middle-class suburban dads in those wretched American family movies.I've yet to see the original ending (also the ending of the off-Broadway musical), which was seen as too nihilistic and satirical for test screening audiences. I have read what the other ending is though, and sounds far more memorable than the rather simplistic one that was re- shot (it was preferred by director Frank Oz and practically everyone else involved in making the film), but it isn't the first, and certainly won't be the last time a mainstream audience would hide behind their hands in the wake of watching something a bit different. This film was one of my favourites as a kid (my brother said that I used to sing and dance around the house to the opening song - a claim I staunchly deny!), and watching it as a 27 year old, I can appreciate it as a B-movie fan, something that obviously flew over my head as a child. It eclipses Corman's cheap-as-chips original, and is ultimately a rather trashy, silly, but undeniably fun experience.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror Musical based on a Broadway play that was based on a movie filmed in 2 days ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the few remakes thats better than the original, well sort of. You see, this movie is technically based on a Broadway play, the Broadway play without a doubt was better than the movie, but the Broadway play is based on a 1961 movie that took only 2 days to film, this movie is without a doubt better than that one, although its not that bad. This However, is one of the best musicals ever without a doubt!This movie takes place in a flower shop in a trashy neighborhood called Skid Row, which, as the second musical number states, are florist protagonist, Seymour, wants to get out of. The plot kicks off when Seymour introduces his exotic unidentified plant, Audrey II, after the love of his life and co worker portrayed by Ellen Greene, to there world and gains instant fame. However their is an issue, the plant needs blood to survive. Seymour starts slitting the tips of his fingers to keep the plant fed. It soon learns to talk, and cries "feed me" when hungry. it also grows to big to be satisfied by a few drops of blood and needs to eat human beings. Seymour is unwilling to go and kill people for the plant, so he convinces him that if he feeds it Audrey will fall in love with him. And so the killings begin.This is a great movie with amazing music and good acting, although Ellen Greene is only OK for the most part. The movies main flaw is the ending, which is a little to happy for my taste. the Broadway play had perfect ending though. But still an amazing movie, 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A forgotten, but very well-done and enjoyable musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I myself am not well-versed on great musicals. I've been trying to watch as many as I could. South Pacific, Sweeney Todd, and now Little Shop of Horrors(although I actually watched Little Shop of horrors first) are some of the many great musicals I've watched to try and get a feel for the genre. The beginning of the movie just slams you with an awesome opening song, featuring the Greek-chorus of the three teenage girls, who'll be popping up throughout the rest of the movie. It's insanely catchy, has a great beat, and gets you psyched for the rest of the film. The movie stars Rick Morranis, as Seymour Krelbourn, a nerdy, clumsy, but well-meaning employee of Mr.Mushnick's(greatest name ever!) flower shop. He's also in love with Audrey, a gorgeous, sweet girl, played by the original stage actress, Ellen Greene, also working at the shop, who's in an abusive relationship with her insane dentist boyfriend, played extremely well by Steve Martin. The plant comes into play as a means of attracting business for the store. However, it turns out the plant is alive and requires human blood in order to grow. The Audrey II, as it is referred to, is played magnificently by Levi Stubb, who has a great villain voice, both speaking and singing. The special effects are magnificent, as the plant has tons of life and personality. You're often wondering how they pulled it all off. There's also a few really funny guest cameos, from legends John Candy and Bill Murray. They only have one scene, but the humor and effort is felt and works very well. Lastly, the songs are all excellent. They were written by the legendary Allan Menken, and probably assisted in some way by the equally great Howard Ashman, both of which you may recognize from Disney's Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid. My favorites would have to be Down on Skid Row and Mean Green Mother from Outer Space. Also, special mention goes to Somewhere That's Green, which is so tender and sweet, that it's sort of played for laughs, but there is genuine heart in it, that truly gets you invested in the characters. The songs are all performed very well, with a surprisingly amazing tenor from Mr. Rick Morranis himself. There's not much else I can say, but go see this movie. It's not for kids, as there is mild swearing, adult themes such as sadism, massochism, abuse, drug use, and murder.However, it's not really overly graphic. It's alright for ages 10 and up, probably. The music is excellent, the characters are excellent, the performances are excellent, and the special effects are excellent. It's just a great movie. By it wherever you can(probably online nowadays) and enjoyable, well-constructed film and musical. 9/10 for sure!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Near Perfect Adaptation of Howard Ashman's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Howard Ashman was, in my humble opinion, under-appreciated as one of the great American playwrights, stage directors, and lyricists, who was taken from us all too young.The original 1960 film of Little Shop by Roger Corman was a quirky, deliciously dark humored B-movie. From that, Ashman wrote a stage play, further developing the characters and situations, with songs co-written with his collaborator Alan Menken, and created one of the great cult musicals. Weird, wacky, extremely dark humor about subjects such as sadism and masochism, yet strangely touching. Sometimes it's compared to Rocky Horror or Sweeney Todd, but it's very much an original work. Seymour and his talking plant, Audrey and her tacky outfits, and the sadistic dentist.This 1986 film, directed by Frank Oz, is a near perfect translation of the play, mostly because Ashman wrote the screenplay himself. Just about every aspect of the film fits like a glove. Oz was the perfect director, as his mix of comedy with puppetry skills was perfect for the plant. Audrey II really does come to life, and the special effects are perfect. Rick Moranis was ideally cast. Seymour is a difficult character to play because he has to be nerdy yet also the lead. In some productions I've seen, Seymour comes off as creepy and not really a likable leading man. Moranis makes the character instantly sympathetic. Ellen Greene is perfect as the likable but ditzy Audrey (personally I prefer Kerri Butler's take on the character, but Greene is fantastic). And Steve Martin steals all his scenes as the dentist, making it a fun, energetic sequence. The songs are all classic, from "Somewhere That's Green" to "Suddenly Seymour" to "Skid Row," plus the original song "Mean Green Mother From Outer Space." It comes so close to being perfect, and it falls short because the ending is changed from the stark, hard-hitting one of the play to a tacked on happy one. Many people have defended this change, stating that the original ending worked on stage, but is too dark/upsetting on a movie screen. Maybe so, but all the same, it really is the RIGHT ending to the story. Seymour and Audrey are two lovable losers who are also dreamers, yet their story is ultimately a tragedy; to me, that's the whole point. I know all the reasons why they made the change; it doesn't change the fact that what they came up with a very artificial ending.Little Shop is often compared to Rocky Horror, but the difference is Rocky Horror is considered a classic film and its cult following is legendary. Little Shop has never been seen as much more than just a dark comedy. The difference is that Rocky Horror had the guts to have a dark ending, and that made it into a little more than just a comedy. Regardless, the film does convey Ashman and Menken's talent, and as the years pass, more and more people have come to appreciate the genius that was Howard Ashman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shouldn't have changed the ending!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I strongly disliked this film when it came out in the 80s. I thought that the visuals were very cool, and I liked the music, but I really disliked the happy ending.***SPOILERS AHEAD*** Essentially, "Little Shop" is set up as a tragedy from the very beginning, with a classic Greek Chorus narrating the way that Seymour, the main character, has doomed himself. Seymour actually does some pretty horrific things throughout the movie (killing people then chopping them up and feeding them to a plant). Then, at the end, there is no retribution, he marries the girl of his dreams and goes off to live happily ever after.Last night, I saw the alternate ending of the film, which is much more true to the earlier Roger Corman film, as well as the stage musical. In it, the evil space-alien plant eats Seymour and Audrey, his love interest, after informing Seymour that he's "been had." The alien plants then proliferate around the world, and attempt to take it over, as depicted in a montage of scenes spoofing various monster movies of the 50s and 60s.This is not a "feel good" ending, but then, this is a movie about a serial killer who feeds his victims to a plant that eat human blood, I don't think it deserves a "feel good" ending. The ending they gave it was much more contrived, and it always felt a bit creepy to me, in that it seemed to reward someone who did some terrible things. I liked the ending they threw away. It was a lot more elaborate, and I would have enjoyed seeing it on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Look out, here comes Audrey II!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based upon the 1982 Off-Broadway production, Little Shop is my favorite musical of all time! It has an all star cast of names such as Rick Moranis, Ellen Greene, Steve Martin, and even a cameo by Bill Murray and John Candy. The film became a cult classic and still remains one to this day.Enter Skid Row of New York. Seymour Krelborn is a poor young man living with Mushnik, who took him in and gave him a job at the flower shop with the beautiful Audrey. However, the store isn't doing so good, and Seymour appears to have a new plant that he calls "Audrey II" after Audrey, whom he adores and loves so much. However, Audrey is dating a sadistic and abusive boyfriend named Orin, a sadistic dentist who lives to cause pain. Back to Audrey II, one night Seymour discovers that Audrey II can talk, and is a plant from outer space, who can only survive if fed human flesh! This leads Seymour onto a hilarious adventure with gruesome results! This is my favorite movie ever. It has a rock musical score, has amazingly talented cast of actors and boy, Rick Moranis sure can sing! Plus Levi Stubbs, who played Audrey II's voice is part of what adds to the fun! So overall, this is the best musical ever, and if you like a twisted movie with great music and loads of laughs as much as I do, go buy this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SCTV + Jim Henson = Only way to do Little Shop.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as non-Disney movie-musicals from the 80's go, Little Shop of Horrors is probably about as good as you can get, although since its sharing a category with disasters like Earth Girls are Easy and Xanadu, that's not saying much. In this adaptation of Roger Corman's schlocky monster flick, Rick Moranis (remember him?) plays Seymour Krelborn, a poor doofus of a kid working as a lackey for a downtown flower shop on its last legs. One day he comes across a "strange and unusual plant" he affectionately names "Audrey II" after his co-worker and girl of his desires, Audrey (Ellen Greene). As Seymour's discovery rapidly grows, so does the store's business; alas the catch is the plant won't grow unless it is regularly fed blood, which Seymour does with a poke and squeeze of his fingers. When Audrey II lets Seymour in on the secret that she can talk (and sing with soul thanks to the vocal talent of The Four Tops' Levi Stubbs), the evil manipulative plant talks Seymour into something a tad more chewy than blood in exchange for empty promises. All of the songs are catchy - standout musical numbers include "Skid Row" (Moranis, though nasal, is shockingly talented at singing), "Feed Me," and my favorite scene, "Dentist!" with classic doll-decapitating Steve Martin appropriately miscast as Audrey's rebel D.D.S. boyfriend. The movie can come off as painfully campy at times (especially if your high school is one of the millions to do the stage production), but through the astounding puppetry of the Jim Henson Creature Shop (Frank "Fozzie" Oz directed) and some memorable funny cameos by the likes of Bill Murray and Christopher Guest among others, Little Shop gets the passing grade, even if the ending does a complete 180 from the original stage musical's.</fullReview>

Of course, I couldn't help but make comparisons between this and "Rocky Horror Picture Show", the latter being my favorite movie musical ever. That being said, this movie was a bit odd in the discovery of a few overly Disney-ish songs ("Skid Row," "Somewhere That's Green," and "Suddenly Seymour") I now must skip through in future viewings. But the film is well handled for a sci-fi horror musical comedy, and Frank Oz knows what he's doing with talented comic actors such as Rick Moranis, Ellen Greene, and Steve Martin. And the Audrey II is excellently realized! Come on-- what's not to like?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Enjoyable Musical Based On A Sci-Fi Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Little Shop Of Horrors (1986): Starring Rick Moranis, Ellen Greene, Steve Martin, Vincent Gardenia, Levi Stubbs, John Candy, James Belushi, Tichina Arnold, Tisha Campbell, Michelle Weeks, Christopher Guest, Bill Murray...Director Frank Oz, Screenplay By Charles B. Griffith, Music and Lyrics By Howard Ashman and Alan Menken.Little Shop Of Horrors was a highly entertaining musical in its time, drawn from an old horror film which starred a young Jack Nicholson, with the same premise of a man-eating plant from outer space. Rick Moranis portrays Seymour Krelborn, an orphan who is given a home and a job by Mr. Mushnik (Vincent Gardenia) who runs a flower shop. Together with Audrey (Ellen Greene) they run an unsuccessful shop until Seymour discovers a mysterious new plant which quickly attracts customer attention. The plant talks and sings (voiced by Levi Stubbs)and thirsts for human blood and flesh, although this is not established until later. Comedian Steve Martin is hilarious as the sadist dentist Orin Scrivello, who derives pleasure from giving his patients a lot of pain. He is abusive to Audrey, with whom he is in a relationship with and this fuels Seymour's anger. Scrivello becomes food for the plant and soon Seymour is in trouble. Tisha Campbell, Michelle Weeks and Tichina Arnold provide the "Supremes" kind of trio chorus narrating the story. John Candy guest stars as an outrageous radio show host. Bill Murray makes a cameo as a patient of Scrivello's who derives pleasure from receiving the pain. The lyrics are fun and memorable. It's a fun musical but truthfully it is not suited for children as some foul language, especially coming from the Plant itself, is used.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird Fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are certain movies that are extremely bizarre, break every movie-making rule possible, and get away with it. Little Shop of Horrors is one of those movies.Based on the hit off-Broadway musical, which was based on the schlocky Roger Corman movie of the same name (but if it's so schlocky, why do we all love to watch those movies?), Little Shop of Horrors is a movie that could have gone wrong in a million different ways, but in the right hands, it is a thoroughly entertaining experience. Directed by master Muppeteer and brilliant comedy director Frank Oz, the be-bop music, talking plant, romance, humor, and creepiness all work together in unison, something that would not seem likely on paper.The story is somewhat of a fairy tale, albeit a twisted one, about a down and out guy (Rick Moranis) and a down and out girl (Ellen Greene) who wish for a happy life beyond Skid Row, but are forced to live a miserable existence in a ramshackle flower shop. But the discovery of a very unusual plant brings unexpected business, unexpected fame and fortune, and one very unexpected problem, because this plant seems to have a very particular appetite. . . .Rick Moranis and Ellen Greene (who incidentally originated her role in the off-Broadway play) make for charming and thoroughly sympathetic leads (I never knew Rick Moranis could sing!). And Steve Martin is hilarious in the minor but certainly unforgettable role of the sadistic dentist. But Mr. Martin is only one of several comedic cameos in the film, including Christopher Guest who gives a hilarious performance as the flower shop's first customer, Bill Murray as the masochist patient, and a few other surprises.Alan Menken, who is probably best known for his work with Disney on Beauty and the Beast, Little Mermaid, etc., and Howard Ashman present yet another dazzling musical score that sticks in your mind well after the movie is done. And a big round of applause must go to the plant itself. Remembering that this was made in the days before CGI, you will be floored by this live animatronic creature. But really, this is a movie that cannot be explained. You just have to experience it yourself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Little Shop of Horrors" is a joyous offbeat oddity--a musical comedy with bits of sci-fi, horror, and romance thrown in for good measure. The result is a recipe for success that reverently recalls Roger Corman's 1960 original without being imitative, and includes a collection of catchy, toe-tapping songs. Rick Moranis is a meek flower-shop employee in possession of a Venus Fly Trap that grows to human-eating size (and with a brilliant voice courtesy of Levi Stubbs); Ellen Greene is the helium-voiced blonde bombshell he loves; and Vincent Gardenia is the overbearing shop owner. The three leads are excellent, and the succession of cameos (including Steve Martin as a sadistic dentist and Bill Murray as a masochistic patient) give the film additional comic luster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but doesn't live up to potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, adapted from the off-Broadway play, has loads of potential but is often defeated by celebrity cameos and and ill-conceived changes in the storyline. After seeing it on the stage, I felt that the Greek chorus, a brilliant part of the stage show, was underused and underdeveloped, and could have replaced the bad celebrity cameos had they been given more screen time. The cameos I didn't like were mainly Jim Belushi and John Candy, popping up to spout unfunny jokes and adding nothing to the movie. However, Bill Murray was very funny as the masochistic dental patient. Also, songs were cut and shortened. I miss the full version of "The Meek Shall Inherit," and completely cut songs like "Now," and "Mushnik and Son." A lot of them could have fit right in with minimal problems.But my biggest problem is the new ending. Changed after a bad test-audience reaction, it is somewhat implausible and doesn't match the tone of the rest of the movie. It just feels tacked-on at the last minute, which it was, shot over-budget after production had wrapped. Unfortuneatly, the original ending has been pulled from the DVD's and is very hard to find, so the footage will probably never be seen.Nevertheless, the movie is worth checking out, at least for the performances and the monstrous plant alone.Rick Moranis does what I think is his best work here, along with Ellen Greene, wonderful as the squeaky, big-boobed Audrey. Steve Martin is hilarious as the sadistic dentist and Vincent Gardenia is solid as Mr. Mushnik. But the standout is Levi Stubbs as the ever-growing, foul-mouthed Audrey II. Every note he sings and every word he speaks bends and twists into something original, fun, sinister, and never heard before.The special effects bringing the villainous pod to life still hold up after nearly 20 years and are amazing, but the methods used to create them seem a little difficult and outdated after seeing how they were made. The whole thing was a huge puppet, operated by hundreds of people at a time and only able to move very slowly, forcing the actors to perform at the same speed so the film could be sped up later. Nowadays, it would probably be CGI, but the texture and organic look of a live creature might be lost.Recently, the play was brought to Broadway to great reviews and perhaps one day they will take another crack at transferring it to film and learn from the flaws of the first try. In the meantime, this version has a wonderful cast and special effects, buoyed by the great, inventive songs of Menken and Ashmen and grungy production design, but suffers from bad cameos and too many changes in the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It does have its charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never in a million years would I have expected an all-singing, all-dancing horror comic about an evil man-eating plant to provide such compelling entertainment, but there you are. I've still yet to see the 1960 original that first presented this curiously macabre concept, and the big stage musical it later inspired, so I can't say for sure if this was an improvement or not on either format, but certainly as a stand-alone film this 1986 version of 'Little Shop of Horrors' works surprisingly well.Ellen Greene's exaggerated high-pitched inflection as Audrey (the human Audrey, that is) does get a little grating on the eardrum, and there are a couple of clichés around the end, but otherwise there's little fault to be found in such a quirky B movie that pretty much accomplishes everything it aims for ? that is, to be merry and light-hearted, and to put smiles on the faces of its viewers. The various musical numbers are all upbeat, swinging and highly memorable, while the colourful cardboard settings give it a pleasantly direct-from-Broadway feel, all helping to transform the essentially rather gruesome subject matter into something unexpectedly disarming. And the cast, with the possible exception of the aforementioned Ellen Greene, just about manage to hit all the right buttons on cue. Levi Stubbs does an especially great job as the voice of Audrey II, the articulate house plant with a taste for human flesh and blood.Audrey II makes such an engaging character precisely because he's got the kind of charisma you could only ever hope to project onto your movie monsters in the 1980s. They definitely couldn't duplicate this same blithe tone were they to remake 'Little Shop of Horrors' today. I suspect they'd be all too eager to render him as some sort of sophisticated CGI creation, meaning visual realism by the truckload, but losing a lot of the story's heart and soul in the process. After all, as with Joe Dante's 'Gremlins', half the charm here comes in knowing that our sinister antagonist is really a Jim Henson puppet. That, in addition to chomping people, he can sing, dance and make practical phone calls seems all the more fitting for it.While it's probably not going to win any awards for being the Most Prestigious Film of All Time, 'Little Shop of Horrors' still makes for a fun and perfectly enjoyable diversion from the real world whenever you need it ? having watched it just a few days ago, I know I personally will be humming 'Mean Green Mother from Outer Space' for weeks to come.Grade: B+</fullReview>

Whatever the case I loved this movie simply for its talented cast.It seems that all (almost) of the former SNL comedy squad have yet again teamed up to stir up a few laughters from their viewers. Now,don't tell me that Bill Murray isn't absolutely fabulous as the masochistic patient,while Steve Martin(who plays an equally sadistic dentist,BRRRR!) is practically the movie's main attraction. Moranis is good too, and I also enjoyed seeing James Belushi and Cristopher Guest. So, even though this movie will never be considered a horror classic (like The Fly was,both movies being released in the same year), I still find it good, clean, simple fun.P.S: Actually, I hate musicals so I tried to ignore the songs and focused on the comedy. Surprisingly, it worked!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie a whole lot. I love the soundtrack, the direction, visual effects, editing, and the actors/actresses in this movie. My favorite scene in the movie was "Suppertime". I love that one a lot. I love Rick Moranis movies a whole lot. "Little Shop of Horrors" is the best Rick Moranis movie of all of his movies. That is my favorite rated PG-13 movie of all PG-13 movies, and of rated PG-13 movies of the 1980s. I watch it every October when I watch horror movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alternate ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a quick comment on the famous alternate ending. Rumor has it that producer David Geffen (now the G in Dreamworks SKG) pulled the original DVD release because he hopes for a theatrical re-release someday with the original ending, and he thought that including it on the DVD would kill any chance of Warners doing it (not that it has a chance anyway at this point). The deaths of Seymour and Audrey were too downbeat and were dragged out too long - they just didn't fit in with the rest of the movie and deserved to be cut (although that also means losing that great reprise of "Somewhere That's Green"). But the FX sequence that followed is absolutely amazing! I'm not sure if it would go over so well in New York after 9/11, but it might work if it's integrated into the original film as a dream sequence where Seymour imagines what would happen if Audrey II escapes. Hopefully, Geffen and Frank OZ can work something out and re-edit the film this way, allowing audiences to see this footage in color and on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The wizardry of Oz (Frank, that is)... The idea of turning a so-so no-budget schlocker into a musical was- at least in this case- a stroke of pure genius. I have the book for the stage play (words and music) and it only adds to the enjoyment. While I normally shun musicals like the plague, this one is so endearing it's impossible not to like it. Muppeteer Frank Oz proves himself a more than capable director (again). Because I was so impressed with this one, I decided to give THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW a look (and was again pleasantly surprised). LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS has it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome music (and an ending creepier than the original)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I don't particularly the entire idea of the original Little Shop musical (man-eating plants just kinda freak me out), especially the ending. However I do love the music! So when the movie version played on TV a few days ago I thought I would suffer through the somewhat gruesome ending (which I thought was coming) and listen to the great score. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the ending in the movie was different from the show, the only thing I missed was the great chorus song "Subsequently", however I think the last shot of the movie (the one with that creepy little plant in the garden just grinning) is much more effective than the propose original ending of the Audrey II's eating the world, it suggests rather than shows and lets the viewer imagine the events that happened after the credits rolled.That being said, the rest of the movie was also great, from the puppets to the casting (loved the voice of Audrey II). Definitely a 9/10 if not a 10/10. Just keep it away from your kids, it will give them nightmares (hey I saw the show when I was 15 and it gave me nightmares)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original b/w, and I haven't seen the stage version either! - I haven't lived - but this film is a good musical.This film is a fun musical that passes the time easily enough. Rick Moranis (surely that poor guy is stereotyped) and Ellen Greene both do very well in their roles, and they carry the film well. But to me, there are only two stars in this film...The brilliantly OTT Steve Martin as the Dentist and Bill Murray as Arthur Denton. God! and these two share a scene?! Oh yes, and it's as madcap as hell! I was crying with laughter. Martin's song about being a dentist is spot on, with the guy just personifying comic timing, and what lyrics!!Audrey II looks cool, and the voice? Wow - "FEED ME!!".Yep, this film is good, not amazing, but as I said, it does it's job. It entertains and passes the time.7/10Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rick Moranis played the DEFINITIVE Seymour Krelborne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a fan of Rick Moranis long before I first saw this movie, and I had always admired his comic/acting abilities, but I was blown away by his performance as Seymour Krelborne. I'm an actress who doesn't enjoy many musicals, but I have about five that I am simply crazy about, and Little Shop of Horrors is one of those. On the stage, I have seen many actors tackle that leading role, but none of them could ever hold a candle to Mr. Moranis' portrayal. I've seen other actors play the character almost one-dimensionally, but Rick Moranis truly showed viewers what a complex character Seymour Krelborne is. Rick Moranis is an amazingly talented man, and as I plan to write thesis on Little Shop of Horrors, I hope that I'll one day get to meet him. But enough praising of that glorious actor, let me get on to talking about the movie. So few plays make a respectable and admirable transition from the stage to the screen, but this one did, and I'm inclined to agree with a previous critic here that this may in fact be the last great movie musical. A fair amount of the play was altered for the screen, like a couple of songs that were replaced by new songs or more dialogue, but that seemed to make the movie better (I was very happy to find that "It's Just the Gas" was omitted from the film). The movie also adds the masochistic dental patient who was in the original 1960 Roger Corman film, but who wasn't added to the play. Played by the wonderful Bill Murray, the character has a delightful meeting with the sadistic dentist, played by the brilliant Steve Martin. Bill Murray doesn't give off the same amusing gay undertones as the great Jack Nicholson did in the original (and if you don't believe me about the original gay undertones, go watch that scene where he tells Seymour, who is posing as the dentist, to "DON'T STOP NOW!!!"). However, Bill Murray does seem to very subtly show that his character finds the dental torture to be sexually gratifying, which of course results in hilarity that is reminiscent of the original film. As for the ending of this film, it's hard for me to form an opinion about it being better or worse than the ending performed on stage. I agree with another previous critic, that the play is a Greek tragedy (and I thought I was the only one who took interest in deeply analyzing that play!), and that it is important for Seymour to pay the price he's given. When watching Little Shop of Horrors on stage, I find the tragic ending to be quite fitting, but in this movie I honestly don't think I could see that happening. I'm not the kind of viewer that has to have a happy ending in whatever she sees, no not by a long shot, but something about this movie made me want to see them live happily ever after. I think I can chalk that feeling down to the fact that, like Leonard Maltin wrote, Rick Moranis "played the character to perfection", and the fact that Moranis and the lovely and talented Ms. Greene had such dynamic chemistry together. Like I wrote above, Rick Moranis played the character with so many dimensions, that I felt drawn more to his portrayal than anyone elses' I had ever seen. I felt more compassion, hope, and love for his Seymour than I had for anyone elses' (Rick even gave the character more sex appeal, in my opinion). Rick Moranis knew how to make his character have that desired and appropriate effect on the audience. So, because of how he truly got down to the heart of the character, I don't think I would have enjoyed seeing his end come. However, I would love to see that ending. Ellen Greene is a magnificent, versatile actress and for her sake, it was a shame that scene was cut; the audience should have gotten to view that. And I'm sure Rick, who hasn't had the chance to do many dramatic scenes in his career so far, was amazing as well. So, what it comes down to is that I would love to see Rick and Ellen in that last scene, for I too feel deprived of parts of two great performances, but I'm still a fan of the happy ending. Does anyone know where I can find the movie on DVD with the original ending? I believe I read that it was released with the original ending, but that was taken out of stores after some time. I would really like to see that, so if anyone can tell me of *anywhere* where I might find a copy (never before seen, used, or re-recorded) of the DVD, I would pay any price asked and be greatly appreciative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb musical whose ending was raped by 80's audiences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen the REAL ending of "Little Shop of Horrors" both on stage and on the DVD release that was killed by David Geffen, it nauseates me to see the ending that 80's audiences WANTED, a happy frou-frou ending with Seymour and Audrey getting married and living a 50's existance.Bah!What audiences missed was a stunning "deathbed" reprise by Ellen Greene, so heartfelt she cries real tears, the fantastic cathedral-like music as Seymour gives his lover to the plant, the excellent song by Greek chorus ("Subsequently"), and the Godzilla-spoof ending in which a hoarde of 50 foot tall Audrey II's devour New York City and the world, with the slightly disturbing image of an Audrey II strangling the Statue of Liberty.Morever, the musical, which is in actuality a Greek tragedy, is deprived of its moral. Seymour in the edited version NEVER PAYS for selling his soul to the Devil. The original ending has the classic Greek tragedy line: Seymour sells his soul to the Devil, kills his enemy, then kills his "father", then kills his love, and finally kills himself.80's audiences weren't able to handle the dark comedy; hopefully David Geffen with authorize an "Original Ending" theatrical release. It's CRIMINAL that nearly no one has seen the tearful reprise of "Somewhere That's Green".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is truly a wonderful movie. It manages to capture very well the spirit of the Broadway show while having a fluid style of filmmaking unlike just about any other film. The people responsible for the sets, the camerawork, the acting, and the music/lyrics all deserve an amazing amount of credit for having everything pull together so amazingly.One of the most notable things about this film, compared with many, is that many of the sets are continuous from exteriors to interiors. In most movies, the exterior shots and interior shots are set on different sets, requiring a cut any time a character goes through a doorway. Here, the camera can start on a character who's outside and either follow the character inside or retreat inside while the character follows (as in the intro to the dentist's song). The film has a lot of long (in duration) shots which really help hold it together. For example, near the end of "Somewhere that's green", the camera shows Audrey insider her apartment closing her magazine three lines from the end of her song. The camera then, in a continuation of that same shot, pulls back out the window and travels up and to the left where the chorus starts in their next song and completes the first verse of it before there's a cut. Other memorable long-lasting shots include Audrey's talk with Semour after Mr. Mushnik yells at him for forgetting Ms. Shiva's flowers, and the last few lines of "Suddenly Semour" where the camera ascends the stairs in front of Semour and pans around as Audrey and Semour embrace.My one criticism of the film itself is the addition of foul language in the new song "Mean green mutha' from outer space". While much of the song is clever, I found the language offensive and unnecessary.Finally, I'd like to recommend that anyone considering watching this film see it on DVD if at all possible. The narrow frame of VHS (or 16mm prints, which is how I first saw this movie) really detracts from much of the filming. Additionally, the supplemental materials on the DVD are interesting and informative. My biggest complaint with the DVD is that I would have liked to have had the original ending included in the supplemental materials. Earlier editions of the DVD included it, but apparently the producer objected so later versions left it out. Too bad since, as a fan of the musical, I would have enjoyed seeing how the film handled the ending.On a parting note, while I'm hardly fluent in French I do know it somewhat; while the French subtitles and dubbed soundtrack don't quite agree, I did find some parts interesting. Some examples:"Downtown... down on skid row" becomes "Our home... in our neighborhood.""Far from skid row, I dream we'll go somewhere that's green" becomes (on audio/subtitles) "Far from our neighborhood/hell, I dream we'll make a little green nest."Highly recommended film.

Ellen especially stole my heart in the "Somewhere That's Green" sequence---her voice is so real for her character. And Moranis is hilarious as always. Also great are Steve Martin, Vincent Gardenia, Christopher Guest, and especially Bill Murray as the masochistic yet pleasured-by-dental work patient. And the trio of girls who serve as the narrator in true theatrical fashion are great! This movie is one of a kind and I recommend it to everyone, old and young!

		<fullReview>"Little Shop of Horrors" is one of the few films that has comedy, horror, brilliance, music, and delight all in one film. It's really an outstanding film. The comedy is hilarious, the story is simplistic, the music and songs are ingenious, and the special effects are state of the art! It's really an excellent film when you take into account the talent and craftsmanship that was put into it. You have brilliant comedians such as Rick Moranis, John Candy, Steve Martin, and of course, Bill Murray. You have an ingenious musical to make it all flow through beautifully and elegantly, with some of the most brilliant songs I've heard in years! You have a great, simple love story. And of course, you have special effects that still impress viewers to this very day!As happy as it all may sound, it almost wasn't. As some of you know, "Little Shop of Horrors" originally ended on a darker, more dismal note. I have finally seen the "legendary" alternate ending, and I must say that it's a dark reminder of the importance of test audiences. Sure it was faithful to the source material, but that doesn't mean it translated well to film. It just seemed too distant from the film's previously upbeat, funny attitude. It's also a shame that the producers couldn't find a way to use some of the footage of the plants destroying the world. The effects are pretty good!In short, "Little Shop of Horrors" is a true delight, and it's rare that you'll find a comedy with so many beautiful qualities as this one does. If you haven't seen this film, you should. If you don't like it, then you're nothing but a "mean green mother from outer space"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since the 70s or so, there haven't been many musicals at all, so it's a great thing that this movie got made. "Little Shop of Horrors" has it all: musical numbers, Steve Martin, and a singing plant. This was director/Muppet performer Frank Oz's first non-Henson movie, and he did a darn good job. A lot of it is blocked as a stage musical would be, to give it that musical feel. The acting is all good &amp; funny, the script is good, the songs are catchy, and the effects are terrific. A lot of the plant effects would today be done by CGI, but the puppetry they use here looks so much more real. I haven't seen the original Roger Corman movie that this is based on and satirizes, but I'm sure it would be interesting to compare the two. It's just too bad they had to go with the "Hollywood" ending rather than the original intended ending. Hopefully someday soon there'll be a rerelease of the DVD with the footage from the original ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant satire... even better music!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most consistently hilarious films ever, "Little Shop" is also THE greatest cinematic musical ever! It far outshines the likes of "Rocky Horror" and "Grease."Films with such a star-packed cast often sink under the expectations of such a talented group, but "Little Shop of Horrors" is filled with high-caliber performances from a wide range of comedic giants. Rick Moranis and Ellen Greene truly shine as Seymore and Audrey, the two leads. Their performances skillfully alternate between subtle and bravura, as the situation and/or musical number demands. Greene's over-the-top vocal style is particularly affecting in the delivery of such numbers as "Somewhere That's Green" and "Suddenly, Seymour." John Candy, Steve Martin, and Bill Murray all appear in instantly memorable and hilarious cameos/ supporting roles.Michelle Weeks, Tichina Arnold, and Tisha Campbell are also superb as the 'Greek Chorus' element, providing both great side-bar commentary and killer three-part vocal harmonies.Even beyond the superior level of acting in "Little Shop," there's also a great satire, which lambasts social elitism and the desire for upward class mobility. In the course of a 2 1/2 minute, seemingly doe-eyed song ("Somewhere That's Green"), "Little Shop" manages, quite effectively, to slap an entire era of American history squarely in the face. What makes this even better is that "Little Shop" is not so full-of-itself that it's 'above' self-deprecating humor, because there's quite a bit of that here, as well.And the music is absolutely classic. It never succumbs to being cloying or manipulative, as so many musicals (re: "Hopelessly Devoted to You" from "Grease") often do. It's upbeat; it's catchy; and it's absolutely VICIOUS in its cynicism. ("Who wants their teeth done by the Marquis de Sade?")Rating: 9 out of 10. Brilliantly acted, with intelligent and thoughtful elements of plot, theme, and satire. Very few films are this uniformly clever and engaging. The ending is a bit too abrupt, but it still works well, as does everything else in this "Little Shop."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong; I enjoyed this movie immensely. I enjoyed it almost as much as I enjoyed the play that it's adapted from. Yes, the PLAY, on Broadway in the early `80's, not the MOVIE, made in 1960 by Roger Corman, which is also a gem. The 1960 movie inspired the play, inspiring the 1986 movie by Frank Oz. And this is where Hollywood took over.In truth, I have not seen the Corman film, so I don't know if the viewer comes away from that film with a sense of the common man as a hero, as with the 1986 film. But the PLAY ends on a decidedly tragic, menacing, unusual note, while the ending of the 1986 film has been tremendously happied up. Both endings have merits, and standing alone, the Frank Oz film certainly is enjoyable and one of my favorites - ending and all. My only resentment is that Holllywood saw fit to end the movie on a happy note with only a hint of menace, as opposed to the full-blown menace of the play's ending, which, even if it were not true to the Corman film, was a unique treatment of the "alien invasion" subtype of the SF genre.An enjoyable, well made film none the less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film goes far beyond being a musical comedy. It's a brillaint satire on class aspirations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always sad to me that so many miss the finer points of Little Shop of Horrors. This one of my top ten all-time favorite films because of the way it deals with disadvantaged people longing for something better. It weaves wonderful acting (Audrey's little squeak when she finds out that Seymore has named the plant after her is priceless every single time I watch the film, which I own on video), great songs, direction, comedy, suspense and set design all together in what I consider to be an ever better cult classic than the over-rated Rocky Horror Picture Show. The "Uptown" scene alone is worth the price of the movie. I really love the depiction of those who live downtown lamenting their social positions in life, while they dream of living uptown...even while acknowledging how they are treated when they are actually uptown as people who live downtown. Ellen Greene's rendition of "Somewhere That's Green" always gets my eyes wet. Even though just about every thing she wishes for as the "Good Life" is a construct of advertising and could be seen as very tacky, she wishes for it in such a heartbreaking way that you really do feel for her as much as you would feel for someone longing for world peace. I think it's an amazing accomplishment that happens when the right lyrics, melody, staging, voice and director all comes together. Of course Levi Stubbs as the voice of the plant is flawless, as are the performances of all involved. It is a pity that some would only single out Steve Martin and Bill Murray for their great performances, when Moranis and Greene's acting shadings are much more subtle. I mean...you gotta love "Suddenly, Seymore"....I really could go on, but the biggest point to make is that I love this film...right up there with my appreciation of the play "Sweeney Todd"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Musical Movies Ever Made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't listen to all the bad press. This movie is highly underrated. I checked it out of the library, expecting a few laughs and maybe a few memorable songs. What I got is one of my favorite musicals ever!The set design is flawless. Specifically, the set's centerpiece, Audrey II, is jaw-droppingly realistic (as well as wonderfully voice by Levi Stubbs).The acting is perfection. Rick Moranis is a complete surprise - he is a powerhouse of vocal stamina. Ellen Greene gets a lot of criticism because she's "annoying", but I thought her simple approach to the character was very well realized, and she brought a unique depth to the character by being simple and blonde, like Marilyn Monroe. The guest performances are uproarious. Who new Steve Martin could sing? And Bill Murray's cameo as a masochistic dentist patient is gut-busting. The songs are fantastic. Menken and Ashman are already well-known for their work in LITTLE MERMAID, ALADDIN, and BEAUTY &amp; THE BEAST, and this musical goes in the same vein. Worth a watch, I want to own it! See it - you will not be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit, this is one rare late music film, beside Marry Poppins, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Annie (all ahead of time), where all the songs match the story line. They don't make musical movies like this anymore. The songs from the beginning of the movie are so strong and emotional, one might think it can only get worse, because there is no step up from there. Guess what, they do get better and more powerful. Indeed one of the best musical movies of the century. It does deserve 10 Stars! As a musician and a writer my self, I am insulted by comments that state the music is lame, because it is just the opposite. I wonder: did the story line come first, or the music?</fullReview>

Rick Morains, Bill Murray, Steve Martian John Candy, James Belushi interacting with each other makes for an amazingly entertaining film. The special affects our top notch and hold up well even after all these years. Audrey 2 is a great monster and villain. It is a horrible nasty alien plant, but is so fun and entertaining at the same time! You have fun watching the creature interact with Rick Morains and telling him he can get what he wants with his help when the creature has other plans!

		<shortDescription>quite fun, in a twisted way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been the third incarnated version of the 1960s short film that saw Jack Nicholson in his first movie, this is a great update, coming straight from the stage. It's been considered one of the great musicals of the 80s, although, technically in Hollywood a film has to be at least forty to reach the official 'classic' label. I'm more bent on definition when it comes to movies. This was one of the highly successful films that saw a lot of cameos from Spinal Tap's Christopher Guest as the first customer to Bill Murray's fanatic dentist patient. Having gained enough recognition from the Off Broadway B musical, Frank Oz takes the helm of directing and did a darn good job. Most people would agree that his alternate ending to the film was a good idea, after doing the original test screening that proved a point. However the truth still remains that most die-hard fans of the play would are more likely to appreciate the original ending where the plant eats both Audry and Seymour. It's a delightful piece with plenty of detail to follow, much in the way Frank's last two pieces with Henson did in 1982 and 1986 when they decided to try something new with puppets - The Dark Crystal and Labrynith. Worth the watch.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, this movie does not have the big fan-base here in Sweden as it deserves, there are not that many people who knows about it. But I will never stop recommending this movie to everyone, it really is a thing of beauty, both for your eyes and your ears!One thing that bothers me now as an adult is how annoying they made Audrey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Growing Pains</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood proves it's the land of second chances with this engaging, inventive, sometimes labored musical comedy.Originally a cheapie Roger Corman flick from 1960 which became a musical sensation off-Broadway in 1982, "Little Shop Of Horrors" made the transition back to the screen as a raucous comedy about a diabolical plant who wants to turn mankind into fertilizer. The plant, voiced by Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops, certainly makes a strong case to his nebbish tender that there are plenty of bad people "you can 86 real quiet-like and get me some lunch!"The humor of Howard Ashman and Alan Mencken's energetic, Brill-quoting score is well-abetted by a star turn by Rick Moranis as hapless plant- store lackey Seymour Krelborn and Steve Martin and Bill Murray in brilliant supporting turns.Martin's cruel character, "he's a dentist and he'll never ever be any good," gets off on the pain he inflicts so hilariously, with the best song in the movie, "Dentist!" and some quality time with Murray as a masochistic patient, that he hurts the film's final third by his necessary if disappointing absence. By then, the film has run out of laughs, even if it still delivers some nice music ("Suddenly Seymour", the other great song) and the master puppetry of "Audrey II." "Little Shop" is never not entertaining, but it doesn't really benefit from the big-budget treatment so much as allowing itself to be overwhelmed by it.I don't even mind the controversial Hollywood ending. I haven't seen the ending director Frank Oz originally shot, but it seems unlikely "Little Shop" would be the enduring hit it is with sadder fates played out for the two leads, played so sympathetically by Moranis and Ellen Greene you really root for them. I suspect cynical Manhattan theater-goers would have loved a gory finale, but I can see moviegoers in general being turned off as they were in test screenings. Still, this different ending has its own issues; mainly from being kind of rushed and tentative in its tone, its comedy reduced to more forced laughs at the stereotypical conventions of mid-20th century American life."Little Shop" works best as a straight genre send-up, with sketch work courtesy of its many "SCTV" and "Saturday Night Live" vets. Even so, John Candy's bit as a DJ is lame padding, as are some of the musical numbers, like the dire "Skid Row (Downtown)." Oz's ability to work with puppets does wonders for selling Audrey II's menace, and his visual cleverness is, as always, a delight for the eyes. Having three girl singers come in and out of the story does a lot to keep the energy up; I enjoy their bits even when they don't always make sense.For me, "Little Shop" will always be a great cable-TV discovery, something you could watch for a random ten minutes here or there, be entertained, and then move on with your life. The film doesn't run out of gas so much as suffer a bit from its irony overload, a need to showcase its cleverness at every turn. It is clever, very clever at times, but lacks for real heart.Still, this is a movie everyone should see at least once, especially if they love cheapo sci-fi horror movies and early-'60s ambiance. "Little Shop" has a lot going for it, even if its parts don't add up to a riveting sum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cheesy fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm no big fan of musicals but LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS captured my heart the first time I saw it as a kid. What's not to love about the ultimate carnivorous plant growing to gigantic proportions as the story progresses, and the ultimate geek whose life is given over to mentoring it? Rewatching it now as an adult, it's easy to see this film as a product of the 1980s. It's all about cheesy excess, and there's never a moment of restraint when some loud, all-singing sequences are ready to be played out. The songs are belted with gusto and the actors put their all into the show. This is a film all about spectacle, and it works.Rick Moranis is one of those guys who I feel got unfairly maligned by producers and viewers alike back at the time. He was passed over as one-note, OTT, cheesy, unbelievable. But comedy is a subjective field, and I always admired the guy for his turns in this and the likes of GHOSTBUSTERS and HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS. Against him, Ellen Greene has a cracking set of lungs and proves every bit his equal.There's a lot to enjoy in this adaptation of the stage musical, not leave Steve Martin's extended cameo as a truly deranged dentist. Martin goes all out with a performance so physically demanding that he brings an adrenaline shot to the heart of energy to the movie. Plus, of course, there's Audrey II, who still looks and sounds great after all these years; kudos to Levi Stubbs for providing the inimitable voice.LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS might not be high art, but it sure is a lot of fun.</fullReview>

It's one of those rare movies that I loved as a child as much as I love it as an adult and that my own children now enjoy watching with me.Rick Moranis is in his ideal element as the unfortunate "born loser" Seymour, he has a perfect helpless sadness about him that almost makes the sincerity of his character seem out of place in this world of other, more wild and colorful characters.Speaking of which, this is my all time favorite of Steve Martin's performances, his evil dentist is so hilarious and well played that it's effortless to forget that the role is being played by such a famous and well known comedian.Throw in the giant puppet plant with an insatiable blood lust and really, what's not to love?</fullReview>

Introducing Tichina Arnold, Michelle Weeks and Tisha Campbell.Excellent musical-comedy that actually has great music and is geniunly funny. It's about down on his luck nerd Seymour (Moranis). He works for mean bossman Muschnik (Gardenia) along with his co-worker Audrey (Greene) who he has a major crush on. She meanwhile has a greasey boyfriend that happens to be a dentist named Orin Schrivello (Martin). Everything is going bad until he puts a strange plant he found in the store window. Soon the plant (named Audrey 2) comes to life and needs blood. Every performance in this film was top notch. Rick Moranis is excellent as nerd Seymour and even sings well. Ellen Greene, who played Audrey on stage, obviously has the character down and gives a flawless performance. Vincent Gardenia is great as the blowhard flower shop owner. And of course, the one remembered most from this film is Steve Martin, who gives his best performance to date as an evil dentist who enjoys others pain. Even with the amount of screen time he was given he manages to give a stellar performance. Excellent acting and great music. Direction is great too, by Frank Oz (of the Muppets). I highly recommend it!!!!!My rating- A minus. rated PG-13 for violence/gore and some language.</fullReview>

In a mixed up world of post war America (with the odd 1970s references)Little Shop of Horrors is a gorgeously funny and romantic film. With all the trappings of a typical musical, plus a dark comedy bonus it is bound to make you giggle. Seymore is the typical Rick Moranus character, and there are many other famous faces as main (or minor) characters. A bit of love, a bit of blood and a lot of laughs, a definite watch for those who enjoy a bit of gore with their love, complete with sing-a-long lyrics.However, it may give you an irrational fear of plants, as well as dentists....

		<shortDescription>Review for Little Shop of Horrors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The little Shop of Horrors was not all that impressive,I had heard the title before and was expecting something that was somewhat intriguing, but i was completely wrong.I found the film extremely bizare and was not able to really gain any interest in the film or story line itself. As if the story was not bad enough the lighting made it hard to pay close attention and the acting completely turned me off. The message portrayed by the film was not interesting at all because it was illustrated with poor supporting details and unrealistic events. Although this is can be calssified as a love story, which happen to be my favorite, I was disappointed by the film. Even though Seymour is willing to do whatever it takes in order to impress Audry and obtain her love, killing people and feeding a plant is not romantic.I suppose this film would impress people who enjoy this type of genre, but even then I am not o sure. I would not recommend this film to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Notes, And The Director's Cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were some things that made this surpass the 1960 original and other things I could have done without.I might as well get the ** Big Spoiler ** out of the way first: in this new Blu-Ray Director's Cut, the two main characters also get eaten by the plant! Yeah, "Audey Jr." is one mean motha, and the film does not have a happy ending. Screening audiences did not like that, so it was cut from the theatrical release.Anyway, the plant was spectacular and the lyrics to his songs had me laughing out loud several times. They were hilarious. The main actors did a pretty good job of imitating the 1960 actors. Moranis was very much like his counterpart. Ellen Greene's main contribution was her cleavage, although she was good as the ditsy-voiced "Audrey,"The music was decent, but nothing spectacular outside of the plant. i didn't see the point of having the three women singing in a number of early scenes.Steve Martin's cameo as the sadistic dentist/boyfriend was memorable, both good and bad. His gestures of a 1950s James Dean-type were excellent but his potty-mouth was overdone. This is the kind of film that looks like it would be fun for the kiddies, but it is not. It's a pretty hard-edged violent movie for a comedy/musical....but adults will get plenty of laughs. The BD boasts a good transfer and surround sound.</fullReview>

Throw in some great Canadian actors, some "Saturday Night Live" veterans, a quirky soundtrack and Jim Henson's puppet crew. (Oh, and get Henson Company member Frank Oz to direct!)While the original is still a great film, this is a definite improvement. The interaction between Steve Martin and Bill Murray really caps this one off -- that scene alone makes this one of the most memorable films of either of their careers.I could not more highly recommend a horror or science fiction musical (though "Repo!" comes to mind).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little Shop of Horrors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the 1960 film, apparently only filmed in two or three days, this is the remake based on the Howard Ashman Broadway musical, directed by Muppet veteran Frank Oz (In &amp; Out, Bowfinger). Basically nerdy Seymour Krelborn (Rick Moranis) wants to help improve business at the florist he works at for Mr. Mushnik (Vincent Gardenia), and get the interest of his co-worker who he has a crush on, Audrey (Ellen Greene, reprising her Marilyn Monroe inspired Broadway role), by placing an unusual and unidentified plant in the window to attract customers, and it works. The plant, Audrey II, seems to have a craving on blood, and grows after every feeding, to the point when it speaks/sings for itself (with the voice of The Four Tops' Levi Stubbs) for his supper. Luckily Seymour finds the perfect victim he can chop up and feed to Audrey II, sadistic dentist and Audrey's on-off boyfriend Orin Scrivello (Steve Martin), Mr. Mushnik is also victim to the plant after witnessing Seymour's chopping up. Seymour questions Audrey on why she loves him, and it's not for the success of the plant, and not long after she discovers the truth, nearly to her demise, Seymour decides it's finally time to put a stop to Audrey II. Also starring Tichina Arnold as Crystal, Tisha Campbell-Martin as Chiffon, Michelle Weeks as Ronette, James Belushi as Patrick Martin, John Candy as Wink Wilkinson, Bill Murray as Arthur Denton and Christopher Guest as Customer #1, Miriam Margolyes as Dental Nurse and Stan Jones as Narrator. The Doo-Wop songs (of course all performed by the actors themselves) are all very catchy, in particular: "Grow For Me", "Somewhere That's Green" (spoofed hilariously in Family Guy), "Dentist!", "Feed Me (Git It)" and the Oscar nominated "Mean Green Mother from Outer Space". With a similar feel to The Rocky Horror Picture Show, this is a fantastic special effects and star-filled black comedy horror musical. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Original Score for Miles Goodman. It was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Musicals. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talk about progress in musicals! There was once a time when "musical" only referred to Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers sashaying around glorifying the ultra-wealthy. Then came "Little Shop of Horrors". Rick Moranis plays Seymour, a down-on-his-luck employee of a plant store. He's interested in co-worker Audrey (Ellen Greene), but she barely notices him. Then, he discovers a man-eating plant, which he names Audrey II. And is that plant ever hungry! Anyone who wrongs Seymour is just asking for it! That includes - but is not limited to - sadistic dentist Orin Scrivello (Steve Martin).Either way, the whole movie is so cool! The songs are as wacky as can be, and the supporting cast (Vincent Gardenia, Bill Murray, John Candy, Christopher Guest, Jim Belushi) is perfect. If only more movies could be like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hilarious musical remake of the cheap production that starred Jack Nicholson from 1960. This version casts Rick Moranis as he is an orphan who is raising a wild Venus fly-trap who continues to grow and grow. Why? It thrives on human blood. So as Moranis becomes more and more famous, he needs more and more victims to keep his plant alive. A really funny musical comedy that works due to arguably Moranis' best performance, solid turns by Ellen Greene and Vincent Gardenia and super cameos by Steve Martin, Bill Murray, James Belushi and John Candy. Far from a masterpiece, but still a nice little piece of entertainment. Levi Stubbs is perfect as the voice of the scene-stealing plant. 3.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know how you have a movie you remember all through your childhood? Well, for me, this is that movie. I remember watching it with my mother and laughing at the Dentist, tapping along to the tunes and just thoroughly enjoying it! Now, I am older, I can't say much has changed. It possesses all qualities of a musical, all the "cliche" of a ridiculous 50's Horror Movie and all the slick, dark (and somewhat disturbing) comedy of a black comedy. Many people will know the original stage show, from which this is based...but the ending is entirely different. Frank Oz re-shot it, because it is not a happy endng. You have two choices...see the movie with the original ending, and...well...say that you've seen the real ending, or watch the movie one, and get the showstopper of the whole movie - Alan Menken and Howard Ashman's Oscar Award Nominated "Mean Green Mother From Outer Space"...it's up to you. I know that people, when they see the stage show, are dissapointed that that song is not in it...as it is one of the best. All the songs are impressive...but that's normal for the Ashman-Menken partnership (who can't hum "Be Our Guest" or "Under the Sea"?) The movie, however, should have had more songs from the Broadway Musical. A good example would be "Mushnik and Son". This would have made the relationship between Seymour and Mushnik much stronger...and it would be funny to see Rick Moranis and Vincent Gardenia to the tango together. I also say this becuase the styles of music in the movie are all that of the 50s and 60s (Motown, Rock and Roll etc) But, if they used the songs from the stage show, they would have more varied music styles (examples include March and Tango) The cast in this movie is very strong, especially Rick Moranis, and his singing voice is pretty impressive for such a small stature. The most memorable role is Steve Martin's "Elvis" perona - of the sadist dentist. His song "Dentist" surely is one of the cleverest display of lyrical play I have ever heard (The Leader of the Plaque!) This movie is going to make a big come back, with a possible re-release in the near future (with the original ending), and a broadway revival for the first time in nearly 15 years in the summer of 2003, people will be hearing alot more of this movie...again! Go see it...or go see it again...and then probably again; Go "Downtown" to the "Little shop of Horrors", and "Suddenly Seymour" and the "Dentist" will provide you with "Some Fun Now"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LOVE IT!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw a rehearsal for the play at a NY Festival. I fell in love with the music and rented the movie, I LOVED IT! Rick Moranis was adorable as the loveable geek, and Greene was fabulous as the sweet ditz, and the object of MOranis' affection. LEvi Stubb's voice was AWESOME and the Greek Chorus was alot of fun. One Complaint: I bouch the Stage Play CD and I enjoued the song "Ya Never Know", instead of the replacement "Some Fun Now". I have never seen the play ending so i cannot really compare, but I LOVE EVERY SONG AND THE WHOLE CAST IS TERRIFIC! My fav is probably Steve Martin as the Semi-Sadist, no one can beat him. RENT THIS TODAY!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much fun...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love musicals, and Little Shop of Horrors is one of my personal favourites. It is wonderfully weird, and close to perfection with only the rather tacked on ending striking a false note.The story has a wacky, weird but definitely timeless quality about it with seldom a dull moment, while the screenplay is funny and witty. The characters are delightful, the most memorable for me being Audrey II, and the production values are theatrical but in a charming and colourful way. And I must mention the special effects, they are very clever and successfully underline the rest of the production without ever swamping it.The score itself is a masterpiece, the lyrics are superb and never fail to put a smile on my face and the music is very memorable and catchy. The cast do a stellar job, Rick Moranis is wonderfully nerdy and Ellen Greene reprises her stage role with aplomb, but top honours go to Steve Martin as the sadistic scientist and especially Levi Stubbs as the voice of Audrey II.All in all, a delightful, memorable movie musical and so much fun. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun trashy musical that is greatly helped by it's cameos</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr Mushnik's plant shop is situated on skip row, unsurprisingly it is not doing very well and is close to shutting down and getting rid of it's employees Seymour and Audrey. However, when Seymour finds a special little plant, things turn around for the shop. When the plant doesn't grow, Seymour finds out the plant needs human blood to grow ? not a problem when it is tiny and sucking it out of his fingers, but a problem when it is bigger than Seymour! When Seymour meets the cruel boyfriend of his sweetheart Audrey, he realises that he has a way to feed his plant ? but where will it end?In The Simpsons, the bits that have stuck in my mind are the spoof musicals such as `Streetcar' and the musical version of `Planet of the Apes'. This film reminds me of those spoofs, being a version of a Roger Corman film and it works in the same way as those spoof do ? by being tongue in cheek and self mocking. The film has a wonderful sense of humour that runs all the way through it ? from the `Supremes' singers to the personality of the plant itself!The songs are mixed; most are pretty catchy and fun but the odd one struggles a little bit. The lead characters are all pretty good. Moranis' Seymour is as wishy-washy as all his characters and he was a good choice for the lead. Greene is not a great asset to the film but she has the perfect look for Audrey ? she does come across as sweet but downtrodden and lacking self worth. Stubbs' Audrey II makes the film work a lot better, his voice helps the plant's personality and is a larger than life character that matches his physical embodiment. However it is the cameos that really support the film and keep it all entertaining. Steve Martin is the best and has the funniest song, but Guest, Murray, Candy and Belushi all give good little roles.Overall this is not a great film and is a little trashy but it is fun. It doesn't take itself too seriously at all, the majority of songs are catchy and fun and the cameos give great support to the good headline cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I've seen the play, so maybe I'm biased but... Excuse me if my opinion differs from yours, but I just didn't think Seymour's character or Audrey's character could sing. They could lipsynch to someone else's voice. Having said that (which, "coincidentally," is a big part of the movie as it is a musical *rolls eyes at casting director), the movie actually wasn't too bad. They skipped a few numbers with cursing (*wipes eyes*) but it was funny (Steve Martin and Bill Murray) and there were parts younger ones couldn't see...but overall it was pretty good. Don't bring those who've seen the play! 7/10 *******</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen hundreds of films at the theater and this was one of only two during which I actually fell asleep. Steve Martin and Bill Murray, along with the Dentist song, try to salvage an otherwise slow uninteresting film. In my book, this is one where the original was more enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"With the right advertising this thing could be bigger than Hula Hoops." Disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Little Shop of Horrors is set in a failing florist's in New York's Skid Row district. The owner Mr. Mushnik (Vincent Gardenia) is considering letting his two assistant's go, Seymour Krelborn (Rick Moranis) &amp; ditsy blonde Audrey (Ellen Greene). However a few days previous Seymour discovered a strange, new type of plant just after a total solar eclipse &amp; decides to call it Audrey II after his secret love for Audrey &amp; put it in the window to attract business. It succeeds &amp; Mushnik's shop has never been so busy as he rakes in the money as people can't get enough of this strange new plant. However Audrey II begins to wilt, while trying to save Audrey II Seymour pricks his finger on a Rose thorn &amp; the plant instantly perks up. Seymour feeds his own blood to the talking plant which starts to grow, but soon Seymour can't satisfy it's insatiable appetite with a few drops of blood. Audrey II demands huge amounts of fresh blood &amp; with all the fame, fortune &amp; success it has brought Seymour obliges...Directed by Frank Oz I was disappointed by Little Shop of Horrors, probably due to my expectations rather than it being a bad film. The script by Howard Ashman is based more on the off-Broadway musical than the Roger Corman horror film from 1960 which is where the problem lies for me. In fact during the opening credits no mention is made of Corman's film yet the musical version is. I want to say straight away that I have nothing against musicals but when I sit down to watch a film about a man-eating plant from outer space then that's what I want to see. For me the musical numbers just annoyed when I'd much rather be watching the plant &amp; Seymour's attempts to feed it. It moves along at a fair pace &amp; is entertaining if you know what your letting yourself in for but I'd have preferred a sci-fi horror remake of the original rather then try to turn a musical into a film. Apparently the ending was changed after bad preview audience reaction to Audrey &amp; Seymour being eaten &amp; the plants taking over the world, well maybe this is the horror sci-fi fan inside me but I think this ending would have been cool &amp; the one we are left with is dull as dishwater by comparison.Director Oz does a fine job, Little Shop of Horrors has a great look &amp; feel throughout with some catchy tunes although at times it just seemed liked the actors were singing their lines rather performing a proper song, if that makes sense. The animatronic Audrey II is stunning, it looks brilliant &amp; has real personality which makes it even more disappointing that it's stuck in a glorified musical &amp; doesn't get to do much until the end.With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 Little Shop of Horrors is very well made &amp; the special effects are brilliant just check out how realistic the movement on Audrey II's lips is for instance. The sets are wonderfully detailed &amp; as a whole it has top-notch production values. The music, songs, &amp; dance numbers are fine &amp; even quite catchy so I have no complaints here, my favourites being 'Suppertime' &amp; 'Mean Green Mother From Outer Space'. The acting is fine, Steve Martin, James Belushi, Bill Murray &amp; John Candy all make an appearance in fun cameo's &amp; Moranis is perfect as the nerdy Seymour.I have to confess that I was disappointed with Little Shop of Horrors as it turned out, musicals just aren't my thing &amp; this has done nothing to change my opinion although I'm sure there are lots of people who love this film out there, the reason I don't like it isn't really the films fault. I so wish they remade the Corman original straight without the songs, oh well you can't have everything I suppose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too corny and stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A re-make of the very popular off-Broadway (and off-off-Broadway) show and 1960 film, Frank Oz's attempt at an off beat musical comes off as silly and ridiculous.In order to enjoy this movie you would have to love musicals, wacky humour and you would also have to forgive the leads' less than impressive voices. Rick Moranis is Seymour Krelborn, a pathetic little shop assistant who discovers an unusual plant with an even more unusual appetite.This is a musical comedy so the plot doesn't matter anyway. Sadly though it does not work as a comedy, and I have never had much time for musicals. Some of Alan Menken's music is quite catchy, especially "Mean, Green Mother", and the scenes involving sadistic dentist Steve Martin and masochistic patient Bill Murray are indeed very humorous. These would have to be the only two pluses though, in a film that is just too corny and stupid to be considered entertaining.Sunday, January 16, 1994 - T.V.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A semi-funny movie with horrific singing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, everyone, Rick Moranis is pretty funny. Steve Martin- pretty funny. The plant's voice- pretty funny. None of them funny enough. There is pretty much one part of the movie that actually makes you laugh, rather than asking you to laugh as charity. This is the Bill Murray cameo, in which he goes contrary to everyone else's reactions to a dentist, is hysterical, and makes one marvel at how a part with little or no lines can be that funny. However, I suggest you mute the television whenever they start singing. Whoever plays Audrey, combined with Rick Moranis, sounds like cats being tortured. Whenever a musical number finished, I would sigh with relief that a moment of horror was over. It's good enough to watch if you are planning on performing in the musical, but not a good leisure activity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror film? A horrible film, yes, but not a horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't find this movie to be any good, and it definitely held no scares or shocks(as you can probably guess from my one line summary). In fact, I pretty much hated it. I didn't even watch a fourth of it attentively, and found every second that I did pay attention to, to be very, very bad and almost entirely unfunny. The exception, the one thing that was a little funny, every once in a great while, was Levi Stubbs, the voice of the extra-terrestrial evil plant(yes, you read that right). He did a pretty good job, and was occasionally funny. The special effects were somewhat good, for a late 80's film. I don't know if my strong dislike for this film came from the fact that I mostly loathe musicals, that I found the humor to mostly consist of the same in-your-face not-in-the-least-bit-subtle humor that you see in most crappy TV shows and comedies today, or simply from the fact that I had expected it to be the Roger Corman horror-comedy of the same name, which I have wanted to see for some time(same as just about all of the other Corman-directed films, after seeing, and really liking, The Terror and Frankenstein Unbound) since the ads that promoted the showing of this movie all talked about the Corman version, or some fourth reason... but I did. I disliked it. A lot. The plot is dull and poorly paced. The musical numbers are awful. The characters are clichés and stereotypes, and poorly written ones at that. The acting is laughable. The cast features many impressive names within comedy, but none of them actually *do* anything remotely funny. Can you imagine how good this could have been if these great comedians had gotten to do what they do best? Steve Martin, Rick Moranis, Bill Murray... even James Belushi, though he's always lived in his brother shadow. The film is just a mess of an 80's musical with bad music. I recommend it only to huge fans of the actors and of 80's movies. Everyone else should really just stay away. It has nothing memorable and even less of interest. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My dislike for musicals is well documented and this one is no exception. Though this one did feature a rather funny performance by Steve Martin. Without him the movie would have been completely unwatchable. As it is, any scene without him is rather boring and lame. I just had the hardest time watching this thing. The story has some 50's style to it, and it may appeal to people who liked that age. However, it is a musical so it was not going to appeal to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Only Horror About The Film Is That It Was Made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be the dumbest movie I've ever seen, and I've seensome dumb movies in my day! They get an actor who's good at every role he plays, Rick Moranis, and stick him with an untalented cast.And Vincent Gardenia is in this movie too. He was good in The Super, but isn't in his other films or on All in the Family. They gotta sing every dang minute. Look for cameos by Steve Martin, ugh! He's not very good in his films so why does he keep making them? And Bill Murray! I hate Bill Murray! He's such a bad actor. See Ghostbusters and you'll see what I mean. Now the plant idea was pretty good. I have an Audrey II bank at home. It doesn't work anymore, but I like it. I didn't like the one in the movie though. And the things they did in the movie were gross! Like when Krelboyne was "feeding" the plant--his own blood. I do not find that entertaining!!! They used the name Krelboyne on TV's "Malcolm in the Middle". It's the name of the class Malcolm Wilkerson is in. Either "Malcolm's" creator liked this movie or hated it, either way he used that name. So in conclusion, this movie is terrible! Don't see it!Don't but it, but if you do, here's something you can do with it: Keep warm this holiday season by chucking it into the fire place. No more cutting down trees, just use Little Shop of Horrors video cassettes. Throw in Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 while you're at it. (I am joking by the way). This movie stinks! It sucks! Do yourselves a favor and just don't see it!! --</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a musical about a shop which contains a giant talking plant, and a geek who fancies this blonde bimbo, who has a nasty, spiteful boyfriend.I have never, ever seen such crap in my life. Full of cheesy songs and I cringed whilst watching this, and then fell asleep about 40 minutes through. What a waste of my time that was! It is embarrassing to watch, I don't see how anyone could watch this film in the privacy of their own home without cringing and turning the TV off.My advice to anyone wanting to see this film: Don't waste your time. This film is appalling and absolute garbage.I rate this film 0 of 10, and that's being generous!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bad remake of a bad 1960 film, somebody inexplicably decided that it would play better as a musical. It doesn't. A really weak plot about a carnivorous alien plant made all the worse by putting it into musical form, thus treating us to Rick Moranis' singing "ability". Far worse than the original for just awful acting performances, a miserable score, and laughable special FX. I would not even consider seeing this turkey again unless somebody held a gun to my head or the head of a loved one and forced me to. Since that is unlikely, I am thankfully done with any involvement with this pitiful failure of a film.1 out of 10. only because they won't register a zero.</fullReview>
