		<shortDescription>Still Unique Even After 45 Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a movie that's gone from cult classic to just plain classic. For me, it's one of the few "cult classics" I saw when it was released and then first shown on television. I loved it then, and I love it now.Forget the musical re-make made in the 1980s. It couldn't hold a candle to the original."Original" is what this is, too. and nowadays, it's great to have it on DVD in which the audio is clear and the picture pretty sharp.I have always particularly enjoyed the many humorous lines delivered by Mel Welles, who plays the flower shop owner. He is the real comedian of the cast, although the plant does quite well as do the two leads played by Jonathan Haze and Jackie Joseph. The latter two are a little more subtle in their comedy. All the characters in here are totally whacked, from Haze's hypochondriac mother to Dick Miller's flower-eating character to the Jewish mother who always has a dead relative to moan about and to the dentist and his patient. The latter, of course, is Jack Nicholson, making his movie debut and looking about 16 years old.In the end, though, what one remembers most is the plant demanding, over and over, to "Feeeeeed me!!" For that, the plant and the film never fail to make me laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funny, sexy black comedy shot by "King of the B's" Roger Corman on a landmark budget of 27 000 and in landmark time of only 2 days! Its the funniest movie i've seen from 1960 or before, and between this fact, the fact that it is black comedy, and the fact that it has the charm and lack of pretension of a cheaply made horror movie, its no wonder it has such a huge cult following.It has the incredibly sexy Jackie Joseph, one of the most buxom lasses i've ever seen, and many risque scenes, which, along with the jazzy soundtrack and black humour, give this a much freer feel than any studio picture of the era, or any picture before. Its humour hasn't aged a bit - and feels quite modern compared to most humour of the day.As an added curio, this features Jack Nicholson in his first ever appearance in a feature film (he was in one short film before it), as the nerdy, masochistic patient who squeals with delight when the dentist is drilling holes in his mouth and pulling teeth. Though its only a five minute part, its a great part.The movie is filled with an edgy humour that the remakes (including the broadway musical, which the 1986 film was based on) are too conservative for. I thoroughly recommend it to you.Corman went on to become one of the most important producers of the century, since he provided opportunities to many young filmmakers in the 70's, whose projects the major studios would never have invested in, and so we would have been deprived of the talents of Peter Bogdanovich, Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather, Apocalypse Now), Martin Scorcese (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull), Jonathan Demme (Silence of the Lambs) and many others. Corman taught them how to just go out and make a good movie, and make it cheaply - and his major qualification to be able to teach them this, in my opinion, is that he made Little Shop of Horrors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming little movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This charming little B-movie tells the story of Seymour (Jonathon Haze), a good hearted yet rather slow boy, who works at a flower shop owned by Gravis Mushnick (Mel Welles). During his spare time Seymour develops a new type of plant, which he names Audrey Junior after a woman he likes (Jackie Joseph). Unfortunately this particular plant feeds off human blood and when Seymour can no longer feed it on his blood, the plant itself forces him to look elsewhere for food.This delightful horror-comedy was remarkably shot in just two days and was originally intended as a sequel to director Roger Corman's ?Bucket of Blood' (1959). However, ?The Little Shop of Horrors' stands out in its own right as a charming and inventive low-budget horror movie. Throughout the movie we meet a whole variety of weird and wonderful characters including a man who eats plants (played by Dick Miller who would also work with Jackie Joseph in ?Gremlins' (1984)), a sadistic dentist, a masochistic dental patient (an early performance from Jack Nicholson) and a woman who can't go a day without a family member passing on. Despite (or maybe because) of the overall absurdity of the movie, ?The Little Shop of Horrors' manages to be strangely captivating yet portray an air of darkness in the right places.Roger Corman directed this movie very well considering his resources and complimented the fairly tight screenplay written by Charles Griffith. The special effects were not of that high a standard but, considering the budget and shooting time one, can hardly have anything negative to say about that. The appearance of the plant as it grows throughout the movie may not be that great but overall it takes nothing away from the viewers enjoyment. Perhaps a little bit more could have been done to represent the plants movement more realistically but, even so, this is just a minor flaw of an otherwise great film. The performance from the three main stars was delightful. Though the acting was hammed up in places the movie never lost its comical charm and some slightly dramatic performances towards the end helped create an unsuspected eeriness in the dying moments.Surprisingly ?The Little Shop of Horrors' was virtually ignored on its initial release but eventually attained a cult status due to continuous TV play. For those of you who doubt its classic status ?The Little Shop of Horrors' has now spawned a Broadway musical, a high-budget musical remake and even a Saturday morning children's TV programme. Short (around 68mins) but very entertaining, I recommend this to fans of quirky horror comedies and general horror fans alike! The movie features good direction, a well written story, interesting and likeable characters and some excellent one-liners. My rating for ?The Little Shop of Horrors' 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A $50 Corman classic!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Little Shop Of Horrors' is one of the movies that Roger Corman's reputation as the "king of the quickies" is founded on. Filmed in two days on a budget less than Spielberg's dinner money, this is one of the all-time b-grade camp classics. While the humour is extremely dated the concept is very black and contemporary. Charles B. Griffith probably deserves as much credit for this movie as Corman. Writing this, 'A Bucket Of Blood', 'The Wild Angels' and 'Death Race 2000' has ensured him movie immortality! Corman semi-regular Jonathan Haze may not be as fondly remembered as Dick Miller, but he is well cast as the klutzy Seymour Krelboyne, "father" of the blood thirsty exotic plant Audrey, and Mel Welles hams it up as his tyrannical boss Mushnick. But the show is stolen by Miller as a flower eating hipster, and an astonishingly fresh faced Jack Nicholson as a masochistic dental patient (a classic bit!), as much as Audrey herself. Forget the crappy 80s musical version, stick with this, the real deal. It is pretty creaky in places but still a lot of fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming little movie to watch over and over again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is ONE movie that made Roger Corman THE king of low-budget quickies, it's The Little Shop of Horrors!! Practically no budget and shot in two days this movie still looks very decent now, almost 45 years later. That's quite an effort if you ask me and it's good to see that this movie finally received the status of immortal cult movie. This is a very charming little movie, to say the least. The story is simple but it keeps you alert all the time ( originally, it was meant to be a sequel to Bucket of Blood ) but it's the characters that steal the show. Every character that walks through the screen is exceptional and hilarious. We've got a guy who feeds on flowers, an old lady who loses a family member every day, a mother with a fetish for diseases, a masochistic undertaker who visits the dentist and almost has an orgasm ( legendary appearance by Jack Nicholson in one of his first roles ) and a whole bunch of others...Too much to list, actually. Jonathan Haze is brilliant as the dumb florist assistant in love. He created a new type of plant and that causes a whole lot of trouble...and comedy. Watch Little Shop of Horrors for it's value in cult cinema, maybe. Or because Roger Corman is an interesting director who deserves to be checked out. Or you could watch it to see where Jack Nicholson started his impressive career a long time ago. But - most of all - watch it because it's an adorable little movie with very funny sequences and a lot of low-budget charm. The 80's musical version by Frank Oz is also worth a look but it doesn't come close to this original version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly funny piece of b-movie entertainment from Corman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mushnick's is a small florists in skid row ? a dead end part of town that everyone knows about but nobody wants to know about. Business is not great, in fact it is awful ? nobody wants to buy flowers when they can't be sure where their next meal is coming from. However the cleaning boy has nurtured a strange new plant up from seed and it seems to be getting interest. When he discovers it needs a few drops of blood to make it grow Seymour is the toast of the town with his employer very grateful for the increased revenue the visitors bring. However as it grows it begins to need more than a few drops and soon he is heading down a terrible, dark road.Like many viewers I suspect, I came to this film after seeing the musical remake; as such I assumed that this would be a straight film in the b-movie genre that Corman is famous for. However I was taken by how amusing this film was because really this is as much a horror comedy as the musical is. From Seymour's alcoholic mother to the cop so hard that even the death of his son is met with a shrug, the whole film is full of darkly comic touches that drew some nice laughs from me. This comic approach helps the film because really it is a silly plot and the fact that the script was tongue-in-cheek meant it was easier to swallow, if you pardon the choice of words. As a horror it doesn't really work but it does have a slocky property that Corman films tend to have ? not high quality but low budget, b-movie fun.The cast match the material and all buy into the joke, watching them also shows that the cast in the musical are really pretty much just impersonate the actors here. Haze is enjoyably geeky and convinces throughout. Welles is funny and plays up to his ethnic caricature well. Corman regular Miller hasn't really got much to do but his face is always a ruggedly familiar and welcome sight. Joseph is not great but her performance suits the b-movie genre ? likewise Campo and Warford (who are very funny as Dragnet style cops). Nicholson is pretty funny and was a curious find in a small cameo.Overall this is not a great film but it is a great b-movie horror. Never taking itself seriously means that it can be darkly funny and take the audience along for the ride. To me it is just as funny as the musical even it is a different type of humour and it is worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plant food!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this on a weekly television show called Chiller, when I was in high school. It was one of those local celebrity things, with an emcee presiding over whatever horror movies were in the library of that particular station. I realized quickly, what an offbeat flick this was. It was utterly hilarious with its moments of masochism, the man eating plant, Audrey one and two, and all the other things that Seymour must deal with just to keep going. The plant controls him and it is a hilarious plant. The black and white neutral staging of the plant is so much better than the flashiness of the musical (though I do like some of those songs). The smallness of this film is what helps make it work. Everyone is a caricature. Jack Nicholson's proudest moment. No wonder he is such a wack, spending all that time in his formative years with Roger Corman. The acting works because it is a period piece. No matter how much we try to reproduce the fifties, it always falls short of just seeing the fifties. It's like Dragnet without the strange suits and the slang of the time. It's just more honest because they weren't trying to reproduce it. I haven't watched this in some time, so I think I'll leave my computer and sit down and watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Nicholson Loves His Teeth Pulled !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Corman made this film in 1960 and was able to produce this film on a shoe string and secured unknown actors like Jack Nicholson (Wilbur Force), " Chinatown",'74, and Jonathan Haze (Seymour Kreilboind), "The Terror", '63, with Boris Karloff and once again Jack Nicholson. Seymour was fantastic in this film, with his Jewish jokes and on going Punch Lines throughout the picture. Jackie Joseph (Audrey Fulguard), "The Split", '68 played a way out good looking gal trying to please everyone, including the Hungry PLANT ! Wilbur Force played a great patient in a Dentist office who just simply LOVED PAIN AND SUFFERING and needed almost every tooth in his mouth PULLED for the JOY of IT ! If you want to see a very young Jack Nicholson starting out in pictures, this is a must see film !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The picture concerns upon a geeky employee (Jonathan Haze) working in a florist shop called Mushnick (Mel Welles) who brings a carnivorous and ferocious plant developing a bloodthirsty hunger and is forced to murder for human eating .Horror comedy blending black humor , parody , tongue-in-cheek and horror . The comedy is absurd and cheesy but gets its moments here and there . Incredible cheap but effective visual effects . This is a well known terror-comedy , it's a quickie but was shot for two days and is deemed one of Corman's best and funniest movies ever made although with lack budget . The principal actors and technicians will repeat along with Corman in various films ,in fact, the picture belongs to horror-black comedy sub-genre as ¨A bucket of blood¨ and ¨Creature from the haunted sea¨, both of them written by Charles B. Griffith (who is the voice of ¨Audrie the plant¨ and besides plays the thief) . In the film appears the Corman's ordinary actors as Mel Welles, Dick Miller, Haze and a young newcomer Jack Nicholson in a comic interpretation as a sadomasochistic who receives a especial dental intervention . The picture is remade (1986) as an amused musical comedy by Frank Oz with Steve Martin and Rick Moranis . The flick will appeal to classic and cult movies fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hilarious Cult Comedy Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Little Shop Of Horrors is a brilliant movie, one of the funniest comedies I have ever seen. I bought this movie from HMV (Top dog for DVD's) It was in "The Classic Horror Boxset" Volume 1. It included other movie classics like House On Haunted Hill, Horror Hotel, The Ghoul, and some more. This movie shouldn't even be called a horror movie, I don't know anyone who was scared by this movie, if they were, then don't watch a movie like "The Wasp Woman." The story of this movie is hilarious, and so are the characters. This movie is about a young man named Seymour Krelboyne, who nurtures a plant then discovers it's a talking, man- eating plant, The plant is funny, the lines that the plant says like: "Feed Me Seymour","You look fat enough". The character of Seymour Krelboyne is funny, he tends to say "I didn't mean it" This movie is just generally funny. This movie was supposedly shot in 2 days. How did they make it in 2 days? The acting is this movie is good. The actors really make the movie funny. Mel Welles plays a funny Gravis Mushnik, and Dick Miller makes a great Burson Fouch and the character of the old woman, every day she loses a family member. The funniest scene in the movie (SPOILERS CONTAINED!) is the scene in the dentist. Where Seymour Krelboyne is pulling out a man teeth. The man is played by Jack Nicholson. This was supposedly his first movie. Overall. This movie is brilliant. There was a remake in the 1980. I liked that one, but the original is still the best. I give The Little Shop Of Horrors (1960) 5 stars out of 5 stars. *****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Campy classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie on TV when I was a kid and it probably never even made the Drive-In circuit but went straight to local television station libraries. Even as a kid I never saw any horror in this but viewed it as a tongue-in-cheek horror/comedy. This is directed by the king of Drive-In horror genre movies Roger Corman who also went into straight to video film making as a producer. This movie likely would have had it's limited late night TV run in the 60's and into the early 70's and then disappeared if not for the fact that a young Jack Nicholson had a fun and memorable role in this. Lead actor Jonathan Haze didn't have a notable career after this but Jackie Joseph would go on to a lot of film, television roles and TV cartoon voice-overs. Other cast members Dick Miller and Mel Welles would go on to appear in many television and movie roles and Miller is still very active today. Writer Charles B Griffith and Roger Corman wrote this in a single night, gave their actors three days to rehearse and shot it in two days. Griffith supplies the voice of the man-eating plant. This is a black comedy, low budget campy classic and I've seen it many times. Great character names and a funny script. This is bad by design which makes it pretty good. I would give this a 6.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of R Corman's finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, how often do you get to see Jack Nicholson at bottom billing, and enjoy a movie. Little Shop of Horrors is a classic farce summing up everything Corman has done to this point. The characters are deliciously over-the-top and ingeniously played by the cast. And the movie throws in one-liner after one-liner, keeping you laughing hard enough (intentionally) you don't notice the little things that bother you in other Corman movies. My favorites include "If hit by a truck call your physician." and "it grows like a cold sore on the lip". The chase scene at the end is something to make the Zucker and Abrahams families proud. So lets all grab a bottle of Dr. Phlegm's cough syrup and drink a toast to the one of the great underground movies that Roger Corman got right. I didn't mean to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Corman's first is still one of his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first version of The Little Shop of Horrors, long before the Broadway musical and Frank Oz's musical/horror/comedy, is one of the primary examples of shoe-string movie-making. Shoe-string, of course, refers mostly to the budget, and this possibly ranks above others like Clerks, Slacker, Night of the Living Dead and Blair Witch in order to put it together so quickly. And yet for all of its little slip-ups and deranged moments of comedy, it does work for what its worth. Not that it doesn't show that the film was made in two days, but on those terms of extremely low-budget, go-for-broke B-movie-making, Roger Corman as a director has quite a nifty effort here. The story is similar to a fairy-tale (a darkly comic one to be sure, like one of the Fractures Fairy tales from the old Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle show), in how Seymour (Jonathan Haze, perfect as an awkward, easily shockable little guy) tries to nurture a plant to earn the affections of Audrey (Jackie Joseph). But then the plant turns into a meat-eater, to put it that way, and from there Charles Griffith's script goes into wild comic turns where he now has to figure out how to take care of the plant before it 'takes care' of him. Some scenes are less notable than others, and sometimes the cheesiness of it all (just look at the plant itself for proof enough) can be wearisome. But Corman keeps the atmosphere with a giddy amount of late 50s 'shlock', and some scenes stand the test of time as the best of their B-movie status. Tops go to the 2nd film appearance from Nicholson as the most psychotic of the bunch, as a 'chipper' fetishist who gets off on getting his wretched teeth worked on- it's a masterpiece of a scene with cartoonish action, innuendo and crazy looks from a 23 year old Nicholson. Worth checking out, maybe more than once, and you're likely to find it (appropriately) in the cheapest lot of DVDs and videos at your local store.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Corman Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't remember which version of this film I saw first the musical or the original. Although, both versions of the film are rather good the original has a true place in cult history. The comedy in the musical is a little more oriented for people of all ages but the original is truly a masterpiece of black comedy. The story starts at Mushnick's flower shop and we are introduced to most of the main characters right away. This is pretty typical of any Corman film from the time. There is Mr. Mushnick who plays a tyrant of a boss, we have Audrey who is a very sweet young lady, then we have the lead of the movie Seymour (who is ultimately a joke). Dick Miller plays the man who is eating flowers in the shop and there are a few other characters who are more on the side. Anyway, Seymour is about to get fired when he tells his boss that he has a plant he might be interested in. His boss sends him to retrieve this plant and of course the plant is dying so Mr. Mushnick tells him he has one week to revive the plant. Of course, later that day Seymour finds that the plant only wants blood to eat. Well, there's the story because you can only imagine what happens afterwords. The end of the movie is still one of the funniest endings ever, I think anyway. Look for a small role by Jack Nickleson as the masochistic dental patient. 8 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of farce, slapstick and backfire humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is possibly the nearest that American cinema has come to producing a classic French farce based on outlandishly unbelievable characters, story and situations. However, what makes it special is the incorporation of staccato New York Jewish humor into the exchanges between the principal players - something like the way the Marx Brothers' ad-libs transformed their early scripts into masterpieces. It is also a beautifully tight production with hardly a single sentence or shot flagging from the breakneck pace and outlandish humor.The entire film is said to have been shot in just three days and, from the way it turned out, it looks as if Roger Corman just turned on the cameras and let the cast insult the bejasus out of each other.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in 1960, this was a typical B-movie fare. B-movies usually took six months to make, and were often not that good, as it was shown after the main feature. This was watchable, and it was often very funny in a black comedy was incredible and horrible. NO, not incredibly horrible! This film was film was shot in two days, and knowing this made the film incredible. Roger Corman, the director did a wonderful job.People claim that the bought this movie for `Jack' but `Jack' wasn't any good. Jack Nicholson had a bit role in this film? A man that enjoys pain. Jack Nicholson stole the show? while Seymour stole his teeth.The movie, in all due respects was funny, dark and crazy. Although the special effects are horrible, get over it! It was shot in two days! What special effects do you want?The remake, all in all was not even close. The darkness is gone, and worse of all, they changed the ending? I'm glad the show was more similarNerdy and clumsy Seymour Krelboyne (Jonathan Haze) and Audrey Fulguard (Jackie Joseph) works at the Mushnick Floral shop on the dirty and poor Skid Row. Impassionate Gravis Mushnick (Mel Welles) the owner of the shop continues to threaten Seymour that if one more thing goes wrong, and if they lose another dollar because of him, (since they are not getting any) he will be fired. BOOM! He breaks a vase. It all turns out OK when Seymour makes a deal with Mushnick. He says that he has a newly crossed plant that he would bring to the shop. The store's sole customer pursues Mushnick into believing that the plant would bring in lots of business. Mushnick agrees and Audrey Jr. is brought into the shop.It gets sicker and sicker, and Seymour hopes that he will find some sort of food it likes before the end of the night. He cuts his finger on a rose thorn and the monster's mouth opens up! He's found something the plant will eat! Blood!? But soon Jr. becomes more demanding, forcing Seymour to murder for the survival of the Audrey Jr. Recommended to all!

		<fullReview>Inept Skid Row florist shop clerk Jonathan Haze (as Seymour Krelboin) is, after hours, an amateur botanist. In a coffee can, Mr. Haze crosses his Venus Fly Trap with another plant, and creates a cannibalistic monster. He names the hybrid plant "Audrey Junior" in honor of ditzy co-worker Jackie Joseph (as Audry Fulquard). Haze is in love with Ms. Joseph. At "Mushnik's (sic) Florist" shop, the potted Audrey Junior draws in paying customers, which pleases nervous shop owner Mel Welles (as Gravis Mushnik). But, Haze finds it difficult to satisfy Audrey Junior's increasingly insatiable appetite for human flesh...Writer Charles Griffith's "Little Shop" is a wickedly funny comedy classic. Roger Corman's direction is dead-on. Certainly, this is the Corman-Griffith partnership at its peak, collectively and, perhaps, individually. The low budget style employed (necessarily) herein has been imitated (necessarily), but unsuccessfully. The film is fresh, and full of wit; and, it is performed exceptionally well. Griffith's own characterizations reveal a promising comic actor (he plays "Audrey Junior", the burglar, and others). The supporting characters are, also, a riot. Especially hilarious are masochistic Jack Nicholson (as Wilbur Force) and hypochondriac Myrtle Vail (as Winifred Krelboin). Flower-eating Dick Miller (as Burson Fouch) provides contrast.

		<fullReview>This comedy built around a flesh-eating plant has very little storyline, but it sure is packed with laughs! You'll mockingly imitate the human-gulping "Audrie" as she squeals "...feed me, feed me!" A very young (then unknown) Jack Nicholson is marvelous as the wacko dental patient ready for a filling. There are many crazy surprises, but face it, this is and always will be a cult classic, NOT Academy Award material.One warning: If you have high standards regarding "perfect DVD quality", you should look for a better transfer copy. The VHS version (around since the early 1980s) offers far superior quality, although it also is less than excellent. The best way to view this piece of Hollywood Nostalgia would be to catch it at a college campus -- It'll make you feel like a kid again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>cheap but very entertaining drivel (or what ever it is) is actually pretty well made and directed even though this took only 2 days to shoot!!!!! that is pretty remarkable in my opinion. plus there was a bit of gore tiny bit of blood there was a cut of foot and hand but not much more but this movie isn't really about that. the effects are pretty cheap looking but that just adds to the fun of it and it's supposed to be that anyway.the acting is very campy but amusing and it works!. Jonathan Haze is very funny here giving a great campy performance he cracked me up a lot of the time. i have only seen him in 1 other movie and that was The Terror(awesome flick)he did a great job!. Jackie Joseph is also amusing here with that funny voice of hers she also cracked me up. Mel Welles was my favorite character here he had me on the floor and i want to see more of him after this he did a great job here giving a wonderful campy performance I LOVED him. Dick Miller is great here in his limited time he was also in The Terror he did good here. Myrtle Vail is hilarious here as the mother that is always thinking that she has some sickness she cracked me up too. Jack Nicholson is HILARIOUS i couldn't stop laughing after a few minutes he is so funny as the guy who LOVES pain. Overall a cool film that is well worth seeing *** out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Roger Corman knew what a Cult Classic was in 1960 ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And was aiming at that as a goal, well, bullseye! Of course the goal was to be done by 5:00 p.m. tomorrow so as to avoid the expense of overtime, but thats beside the point. The point? Just way cool Cult Classic campy fun. You pretty much have to love this movie. Jack Nicholson as dental patient Wilbur Force (Trivia for those of you who read comics ... Does that name ring a bell? If not, hey, maybe you're just a born looser. ), the cost of plant food even in '60, the victims of hunger being planted one by one, and of course Seymore. This thing, in its entirety, is classic. All the way. For a film that had the budget of "Whats under the car seat and the pillows on the couch?" and done in two days of shooting you can't do better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to shot a movie in two days!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a movie! It's got (A) an infamous reputation, (B) a cult following, and (C) the pride of knowing it inspired both an off-Broadway musical comedy and a big-budget movie musical.All this from a Roger Corman movie that was shot in only two days! It's all about a nerdy flower store clerk who boosts business in a skid row store by displaying a talking, meat-eating plant he calls Audrey, Jr. (named after the girl he loves). The owner of the shop is played by Mel Welles, who went on to direct "Lady Frankenstein" in Italy. The screenplay was written by Charles Griffith, who also plays a hold-up man and provides the voice of the carnivorous plant ("Feed me! I'm hungry!") He later had to sue to receive credit when the stage play became a hit.Young Jack Nicholson is a masochist who visits his dentist for fun. Dick Miller is a customer who buys flowers and eats them. Jonathan Haze stars as the clerk who serves the hungry plant until it's big enough to eat the store (although the box of the prerecorded tape shows the now-famous Nicholson holding the plant).Despite the film's seventy-minute running time, it's crowded with black-comedy gags; they overlap each like roofing shingles. The first one is a quick spoof of "Dragnet's" typical kick-off narration, after which things get increasingly frantic until the plot finally swallows its own tail and vanishes altogether. Critics initially scoffed at Corman's "two-day movie", but now they refer to it as "one of Corman's best efforts". A computer-colorized version is available if you'd like to see what a carnivorous gilded lily looks like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gravis Mushnick is a cheapskate flower shop owner in a poor neighborhood. Seymour Krelboyne is a clumsy worker. Mushnick wants to fire him but he claims to have a new kind of flower that could be a good money maker. Seymour's mother is a bed ridden drunk. He names the plant Audrey junior after his beautiful co-worker Audrey Fulquard. Then late one night, he discovers that Audrey junior loves blood. The plant becomes healthier overnight.This is one of the great contributions of schlock filmmaker Roger Corman. This is a completely weirdly original story. It is insanely quirky and odd. I wouldn't say it's laugh out loud funny. However it's quite watchable even though the quality of production is very low. For such a great original, I am willing to add one to my rating. Also watch out for a young Jack Nicholson as masochistic patient Wilbur Force.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Little Shop of Horrors once on TV when I was in junior high and my girlfriend saw it also. For weeks we made giggling "Feed me! I'm hungry" jokes and we both thought of it as a really bad-funny horror film. I just saw it again and realized we were wrong. It was not a 'really bad-funny horror film; it was a really really good dark comedy. The fact that Corman made it in just 2 days for $27,000 only adds to my amazement as to how good it is. Every character was an eccentric gem, especially Jack Nicolson's masochistic dental patient, better even than Bill Murray's later portrayal of the same character - and that is saying a lot. I especially liked the two cops, Fink &amp; Stoolie with Fink doing an excellent Joe Friday. If you like black comedy - and I do - please give the 1960 version of Little Shop of Horrors a look-see. If you find it even half as funny as I did, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the few Roger Corman productions that I've enjoyed. And it's mainly because of the ghoulishly amusing story, a couple of outrageous performances, and the wit built into Charles B. Griffith's script.Gravis Mushnik operates a flower shop on "skid row" in Los Angeles. He can afford two employees, the innocent Audrey and the clumsy, mother-dominated Seymour. The boy is so inept he sends flowers to a funeral with a "Get Well" card, and others to a hospital patient with "Rest in Peace." To keep from being fired, Seymour brings in a strange plant, a mutated Venus fly trap. The plant is small at first, a bulb the size of an avocado, but when it's fed flesh, it grows as large as a refrigerator. It's up to Seymour to keep finding it fresh meat and he does -- a railroad detective, then a sadistic dentist, and finally a beautiful whore. Two accidents, one self defense. Seymour decides that the plant will make him famous and rich enough to marry Audrey. In the end, Seymour is consumed by his own ambition.I would guess that the budget was something less than that available to a marching band in St. George, Utah. The opening, noir-like narration by a detective, accompanies a picture of Skid Row, and it really IS a sketch, in a crowded style something like Robert Crumb's. Some of the performances are so poor that the actors might have been dragged in from the street and paid off with a box lunch.But, oh, the presentation! Gravis Mushnik, the store's owner, is a big man with dark eyes, like Charlie Chaplin's frequent villain. His speech is full of Yiddish locutions -- flowery, ironic, unabashed and unashamed. "It's a finger of speech." "Come, talk on me." And the signs on the wall of his shop. "Lots plants cheap!" And, "We don't letting you spend so much." He's a marvelous character, the waving of his arms, the agonized ululations, and the rolling of his eyes heavenward with disbelief.The sometimes sharp wit extends to lesser characters, like Dick Miller, the customer who buys bouquets only to eat them. "Be back tomorrow. I love kosher flowers." When Seymour's mother tells him, "They're presenting my son with a trophy," Miller comes back with, "Oh, yeah? What'd he do, run away from home?" I won't go on about the scene in the dentist's office except to mention Jack Nicholson as the whining pain freak with the high-pitched voice. Oh, and the insane dentist who drills Nicholson's teeth full of holes and mixes the filler, saying, "I can't afford silver. This stuff doesn't last long but it tastes good," and then takes a spoonful of it.The musical score is by Fred Katz, a popular cellist and jazz musician of the period. I doubt he was responsible for what we hear on Seymour's Mom's radio: "Music for old invalids. And now -- Sickroom Serenade." The movie has no mercy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sci-fi movie that inspired the more familiar musical that came later on. Jack Nicholson is hilarious as the masochistic dental patient, but what really caught my attention is that this movie is way more emo than the musical. Seymour, with his horn-rimmed dark glasses, plaid scarf, and self-deprecating personality, is almost reminiscent of Rivers Cuomo. He even runs into a prostitute and is immune to her over-the-top sexuality. If I didn't know better, I'd think I was watching a sci-fi version of "The Catcher in the Rye." With a giant plant. But hey, when you think about it, that actually sounds kind of cool. It was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cheesy fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Roger Corman film is great cheesy fun--mostly because it never takes itself seriously and has a deliciously dark sense of humor. Quite often, the jokes are corny, the acting way over the top and the sight gags are silly as can be--resulting in a very charming movie that is sure to please everyone except stick in the muds and people too sophisticated to give an American International film a look.The plot is beyond weird, as Seymour Krelboyne is a pitiful loser living in the worst neighborhood and working a nowhere job for Mr. Mushnick. However, this loser gains instant fame in the neighborhood when he cultivates a plant he names "Audrey, Jr.". The only problem is, this weird new wonder begins to die until Seymour discovers the secret to making it grow--human blood. At first, he gives it some of his own, then through some hilarious accidents, he begins feeding it entire people! And, the more he feeds it, the bigger it grows and the more it begins to demand more food--in a very loud and silly voice! It's all very silly and very reminiscent of another dark Corman comedy, BUCKET OF BLOOD--which, incidentally, stars Dick Miller who is also a supporting player in this film.What also makes the film wonderfully entertaining is the use of weird characters with weird names--such as Mr. Mushnick, Seymour's psychosomatic mother and the mad performance in a small part by Jack Nicholson as a masochist!! Murder, pain and excess--this film is like Roger Corman meets John Waters. A great film for anyone wanting a good laugh plus it's not too dark to let the kids see it as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dated, but still worth a watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSIn 1986 a movie was made staring Rick Moranis and was an all singing affair known as "The Little Shop Of Horrors", skip to 2003 and to my surprise that Moranis's little feature was a remake of a 1960s movie of the same title. Avoiding any sort of criticism I might receive for not being aware of this original classic, what can I say about it?Well all in all, it's not half bad. Sat watching it for the first time on Dvd, it struck me as slightly distressing that it appeared so badly dated and the film quality was in rather bad shape. Is this the case for so many gems from the 60s or earlier? If not, why in particular does this seem to be the case for this movie. A movie which, whilst not possessing the musical numbers of the remake (something I enjoyed a lot), was still the original and ultimately is a more rewarding experience.In "The Little Shop Of Horrors" we're introduced to Seymour Krelbourne (Jonathan Haze) who working at a struggling flourist develops a form of Venus Flytrap Hybrid which he names Audrey Jnr in tribute to his coworker Audrey Fulguard (Jackie Joseph). The one flaw which Seymour soon discovers about Audrey Jnr is that his little plant is a carnivour with a taste for human blood.This movie is, as I previously mentioned, a gem. I don't know whether it could be described as missing as obviously a lot of people will have seen it, but I must confess it's a new pleasing discovery to myself. The special effects on minimal, but they work. The script is good in itself. The acting is top notch, including a performance by Dick Miller (who I embarassingly recognise more as Murray in Gremlins 1 &amp; 2 than as any other part) as Burson Fouch, a man with a taste for flowers ..... literally. Finally and most amazingly of all, this seventy minute film was filmed in just two days. It's nice to see that countless retakes aren't necessary to produce a good piece of entertainment.Also, it's probably worth mentioning one last thing about this movie, and that is the small appearance by a young actor by the name of Jack Nicholson. At the time of shooting "Little Shop Of Horrors", our Jack was in his young twenties and obviously impressed with his extreme portrayal of a man who enjoys the pain of a dentists, as after this movie the guy continued to act and as they often say, the rest is history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A deliciously silly film full of cleverly hidden "in" jokes - the sad woman who loses relatives every day is called Siddie Shiva - that's a reference to the Jewish custom to sit "Shiva" (to sit in mourning for 7 days).The malapropisms are wonderful, but much of the humour is hidden in the small details which must have been either very lucky accidents or cunningly planned (the policeman has an almost surreal appearance because of his strangely over-sized glasses).The setting is skid row, and all the characters are clearly speaking Immigrant English, replete with malapropisms, hence Audry's reference to "Cesarian Salad", and somehow all the characters seemed to be a bit "comic book" rather than aiming for realistic performances.Nicholson's role is hilarious, if a bit short. You can see that was destined to play some unsettling roles in future...I felt that the copy I saw looked like broadcast TV rather than film, but it was clean and sharp, unlike US TV images quality from 1960. The sets were cheap and it really felt like watching an extended Twilight Zone episode but on a higher budget and with humour added.But that all made the film better rather than worse. If you want a good laugh, this original version knocks the spots (or buds!) off the 1986 remake!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seymour Krelboyne (Jonathan Haze) is a clumsy young nebbish who works in a flower shop and who has grown a very unusual new plant, something along like the lines of a Venus flytrap. As it grows, it brings him much fame, and it helps to bolster his confidence. Unfortunately, he finds that the plant is bloodthirsty. Not only that, but it can actually talk as well, and soon it's relentlessly prodding him towards procuring it human victims for sustenance.One of legendary producer / director Roger Cormans' best known and best loved movies, its reputation as The Film Shot in Two Days precedes it, but it's really quite an entertaining little dark comedy gem. It's got a high body count and also takes a very cavalier attitude towards death, giving it a fine edgy quality. The dialogue is just full of malapropisms spouted by some of the characters. It's got a high quotient of solid gags, and the cast simply couldn't be better.Corman stock company player Haze, in *the* big role of his career, is appealing as the put upon Seymour. Jackie Joseph is cute in the role of Seymours' co-worker Audrey, who has inspired him to name the plant Audrey Jr. Mel Welles is great blustery fun as flower shop owner Mr. Mushnick. The great Dick Miller of so many fun Corman movies is hilarious as Burson Fouch, who regularly munches on flowers. Other fine contributions are made by Myrtle Vail as Seymours' hypochondriac mom, who has a devastating idea of what constitutes fine cuisine, Leola Wendorff as Mrs. Shiva, whose family members are always dying, Wally Campo and Jack Warford as the deadpan, 'Dragnet' inspired police detectives, Meri Welles (Mrs. Mel Welles at the time) as the hooker Leonora Clyde, and John Herman Shaner as sadistic dentist Dr. Farb. Viewers will automatically recognize the young Jack Nicholson in one of his earliest film roles; he's a riot as masochistic dental patient Wilbur Force, who's addicted to dental pain. Writer Charles B. Griffith appears on screen as the hold-up man &amp; the screaming man in Farbs' office, and is also the voice of Audrey Jr.The jazzy score by Fred Katz and Ronald Stein is enjoyable and the puppeteering / effects are actually pretty good.This is one production that has definitely transcended the gimmick of originally having been made as a joke. It's a wonderfully loony story that inspired a Broadway musical that itself got filmed in 1986.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absurdly funny farce, with a lexicon all its own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Little Shop of Horrors" is a low budget (almost no budget) film that doesn't fit the fright and terror of the horror genre. It's in a league of somewhat scary flicks that are funny as well. The silly premise here is festooned with farce, parody, puns, sight gags, and horrendously humorous lines. The movie pokes light-hearted fun at all sorts of subjects with impunity. The script subtly and not so-subtly switches between subjects that it knocks. One moment it jabs at an ethnic neighborhood, and the next it pans a phobia of dentists. The cast is mostly unknown outside the industry at the time and a cult following today. One exception is a 23-year-old Jack Nicholson in just his fourth movie. This is a decade ahead of his A-film roles and 15 years ahead of his Oscar performance in "One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest." Here he plays Wilbur Force with hilarious aplomb. Nicholson's scene in the dentist's office is one of the funniest of the film, combining dialogue and sight gag. In the waiting room, he's reading an article by a doctor in a magazine: "There were other complications. The man had cancer, tuberculosis, leprosy and a touch of the grippe. I decided to operate." One of my favorite scenes is when Seymour, played by Jonathan Haze, goes home to check on his hypochondriac mother. He walks in the door and we hear the radio from his mother's bedroom. "This is radio KSIK. You've been listening to music for old invalids. Our next selection is entitled, 'Sick Room Serenade.'" Seymour is the source of most of the buffoonery in the film. Many sight gags happen throughout the film, and some go by rather quickly. I caught one in a street scene as the camera was panning toward Mushnick's flower shop. A billboard above the street shops advertised in large letters, "Skidrow Seminary." A sign in the flower shop reads, "We don't letting you spend so much."The names of many characters are wonderful jabs at Hollywood and humanity. Detective Sergeant Joe Fink parodies Joe Friday of the long- running TV police drama, "Dragnet" (1951-1959). But in this film, Joe Fink says "I'm a fink," and his partner is Detective Frank Stoolie. Finks and stoolies were the same thing in the underworld of that day, and the terms still are used today. Mrs. Siddie Shiva is a pun for a Jewish funeral rite. Then there's Hortense Fishtwanger of the Society of Silent Flower Observers of Southern California ? the SSFOSC. And, there is Gravis Mushnick, for which I offer one possible generic parody ? a producer or lover of serious mushy romance stories. By a wild stretch of the imagination, I can see a clever similarity of this movie with the 1940 big-name film, "The Shop Around the Corner." Who knows what director Roger Corman and writer Charles Griffith had in mind at the time? Or any time?All of this is fun, of course. What makes this movie a true treasure and delight to watch ? and listen to, is the witty script. Two characters stand out for their riotously laughable lines and hilarious malapropisms. Jackie Joseph is a hoot as demure Audrey Fulquard. And Mel Welles is over the top hilarious as the bombastic Gravis Mushnick. This is a great piece of comedy film, well worth having in any film library. I encourage viewers to read the IMDb Trivia and Quotes sections. Here are some of my favorite funny lines and malapropisms. The latter are wrong words (or no words) that sound like words that should be used, so that the dialogue is nonsensical and usually very humorous. Gracie Allen was a master of malapropism on the George Burns and Gracie Allen TV show (1950-1958). Mrs. Shiva: "I thought possibly because I give you all my funeral business, that maybe you should possibly give to me a little cut rate." Mushnick: "Look at me, Mrs. Shiva. What am I ? a philatelist? To my throat I would be giving a cut."Mushnick, to Seymour: "You're fired!" Audrey, to Mushnick: "Why don't you give him a chance to resurrect himself?"Winifred Krelboyne, reading a medicine bottle label: "If you get hit by a truck, call your physician."Mushnick: "I don't like my house cluttered up with rotten vegetables."Seymour to his mom, Winifred: "Look Ma, I've gotta go. Can I bring you anything?" Winifred: "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Bring me the Evening News. They're running a self-diagnosis contest. The winner gets to go to the Mayo Clinic."Seymour: "I gave it (the plant) a name." Mushnick: "What name?" Seymour: "Aw, gee ?" Mushnick: "What, you gave it a dirty name that you can't even mention it?"Burson Fouch: "I'll see you tomorrow. I'm crazy about kosher flowers."Audrey to Seymour: "I think you're a fine figurative of a man."Seymour: "Look, Audrey. Isn't he beautiful? Isn't he delicious? Isn't he got a $2 raise? What happened to your fingers?" Seymour: "Bee stings." Mushnick: "All four fingers?" Seymour, holding up both hands: "All 10 fingers."Seymour: "Look at that. It's almost a foot long." Audrey: "Isn't it a spiracle?" Mushnick: "It grows, like a cold sore from the lip."Girl in the flower shop: "Doesn't it have a scientific name?" Mushnick: "Yes, of course. But who could denounce it?"Audrey, to Mushnick: "Try to eat something. It'll calm your agrimation."Seymour: "Ain't that something'?" Audrey: "It's monstrosinous."Seymour: "You kiss good, Audrey." Audrey: "I guess I just have a good kisser."Mushnick: "It's a finger of speech."Mushnick: "Are you hungry?" Audrey: "Sure am. I could eat a hearse."Audrey: "There's a lady from some kind of a comitance outside."Seymour, to his dentist: "It's this tooth, over here."

		<fullReview>"Seymour Krelboyne" (Jonathan Haze) is a bumbling store clerk for a flower shop deep in the heart of skid row in Los Angeles. His boss, "Gravis Mushnick" (Mel Welles) finally gets tired of his incompetence and decides to fire him. But as luck would have it, Seymour has grown a brand new plant which is very rare and when people flock in to see it Gravis has a change of heart. What neither Seymour nor Gravis realize is that this plant feeds on blood. And Seymour only has so much to spare. At any rate, rather than spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it, I will just say that I first saw this movie as a kid about 50 years ago and I remembered it to this day. Back then I regarded it as a horror film, but having recently seen it again I can now appreciate it for the comedy it was all along. A "black comedy" to be sure, but a comedy just the same. I can now also appreciate Roger Corman's ability to take a shoe-string budget and make something out of almost nothing. Definitely worth a view.</fullReview>

The acting was great a bit goof but for the purpose of the characters they were playing which made the movie a lot more enjoyable. The detectives that were trying to solve the murder were the best detectives ever, one cared more about solving the case instead of greaving over his child and their method of interigation is top notch they get straight to the point.

		<fullReview>I remember seeing the musical version of this classic movie back in my youth and did enjoy that, but never having seen the original 1960 movie, I made a super bargain at a local DVD store and picked it up.Now, keep in mind that this movie is 52 years old already and shot in black/white, but still it was a great movie to watch. A lovely dark comedy with a funny and good story.To shortly summarize what "The Little Shop of Horrors" is about, then Seymour Krelboyne (played by Jonathan Haze) works at Gravis Mushnick's (played by Mel Welles) flower store, and he is hopelessly in love with Audrey Fulquard (played by Jackie Joseph). Having a very unique plant, Seymour names the plant after his love, and he accidentally finds out that the plant needs blood to live. As the plant grows in size, which it does at an alarming rate, the plant grows more and more hungry and need more than just blood to satisfy it's ravenous desire.The storyline is very good, easy to follow and offer some funny moments. Being such an old movie, don't expect too much from the props and scenery, although I will say that the movie actually fares quite well with whatever meager props and scenery they made use of.And of course, Jack Nicholson, is in this movie as well, one of the first performances of his I have seen personally, but he is not the star of the movie. After his fame and success in Hollywood, of course, his name is one of the headliners on the DVD cover, despite him having a small role only."The Little Shop of Horrors" is a definite must watch movie, because it is a great comedy from that age, and probably a pioneer in its genre at the time. Well worth a watch and a great addition to any movie aficionado's DVD collection.</fullReview>

I saw a play version of this when i was younger and though i really enjoyed the play this version a little better. The classic black and white color made it plain but the lighting, was simple and great throughout. There were a few flaws that i saw. In a couple scenes one of the characters faces is blocked by a piece of furniture or a railing. In my opinion it just looked bad. But, for a story about a young murderer whom is always on the wrong side of an accident, the goofy approach fits perfectly. It eases the seriousness of the crimes and plays right into the idea of a blood thirsty, man eating plant. the movie is constantly funny and exciting with the most outrageous characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Happy Accident</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A nerdy flower shop assistant nurtures a flesh-eating plant, leading to fame fortune, and a funny movie.I can't imagine anyone thought this 3-day wonder would have the afterlife it's had. The movie only surfaced from underground thanks to that old TV staple the Late Show, where it built up a cult following. I doubt that more than 50 ticket buyers saw it on initial release. Thanks to a colorful cast, a witty script, and a novel concept, this shoestring exercise in black humor could be called a 'happy accident'. Haze is flawless as the junior-grade Jerry Lewis, Jackie Joseph is sweetly sexy, while Welles grouches amusingly as the boss. Then there's the wild-haired Myrtle Vail as a mother whose home cooking could frighten Jack the Ripper. Also, shouldn't forget Audrey Jr. who's not likely to be found in any neighborhood pet store or garden shop, for that matter.I'd like to know the backstory to the production. A three-day shooting schedule is brief even for the famously budget-minded Corman. But somehow the main elements all came together, which I guess shows that sometimes results don't depend on budget.In passing?note how the updated poster headlines Jack Nicholson and no one else, even though he had only a cameo role, a funny one, but a cameo, no less. To me, that's not fair to the rest of the cast, who may not be 'name' stars, but do get most of the laughs. Also, note presence of Karyn Kupcinet as the dark haired teen who, along with her blonde pal, squeals over Seymour's celebrity. Her high-profile murder in 1963 remains unsolved to this day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard of this movie over and over so I was happy to watch it. Turns out I had heard of the 1986 version but I was happy to watch this one anyway. The story by itself is funny in a twisted way; a man eating plant. I like films with story elements that make no sense, like this one where a tire comes to life and can blow things up with its mind. I thought the ending was great and funny and sad. They did as good a job as they could with making the man eating plant. I'm glad they had it in the movie or else it wouldn't be half as interesting. The plant itself was hilarious too with how it talked. Overall I actually enjoyed it and can't wait to see the newer version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind of cheap and lame but also funny and original at the same time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a bit of an odd movie. On the one hand its being entertaining but on the other it's also being a quite poorly made and simplistically written one. In other words; this movie is pretty much the perfect definition of a fun campy B-movie! No, it obviously is not as great as the 1986 musical version of this movie but that's all because this movie was pretty much being a very fast, simple and cheap one to make. Just like any other Roger Corman production! And Corman did not only produce this time, he also co-directed the movie, no doubt to make sure this movie got done quick and cheaply!I sort of still wish some time and effort got put into it, since the movie its main premise definitely deserved a better and more thought out treatment. Something that did happen for the 1986 Frank Oz movie. It also truly could had benefited this movie, since now instead some of the story developments only work out half and don't seem to be fleshed out fully. It's a movie that seems to be filled with half ideas. Good ideas! But half ones nevertheless.But obviously it doesn't harm the movie all too much. The movie does still has plenty of good comedy in it, which mostly comes from its fun characters. Some of the stuff is pretty random but that's what's making it so fun. It's concept also makes the movie a quite original one to watch. What is it? A comedy? A science-fiction movie? A horror? A little bit of all, which gets beautifully and effectively combined!The cast doesn't really impress all that much. You have the feeling that with a bit more star-power behind it, or some actors with a better sense of comical timing, this could had turned into a far better and also more successful movie, at its time. Just imaging what would had happened if someone like Jerry Lewis played Seymour Krelboyne. The movie would had been huge!But there actually still is a big star in this movie; the 23-year old Jack Nicholson. It wasn't his first movie appearance but it's definitely the earliest one I have seen by him. He's already being very Jack Nicholson-like in this and even though he only was 23 at the time, he's much older looking already. His role is actually really one of the most fun ones and forms one of the highlights of the movie, even though he is only in it for a couple of minutes.Despite everything, this movie still remains a perfectly good and fun one!7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. This movie was great. Disregard the fact that it debuted in 1960 and it is a black and white film. This was a hilarious film anyone could enjoy. I loved the humor- everything about it! The crazy dentist who loves inflicting pain- The man in the beginning of the movie who eats flowers as a delicacy- and Mr. Mushnick, ohhh Mr. Musnick was the funniest of all. I do not know if it is considered classic right now, but when Mr. Mushnick (refering to the plant) says, "It grows like a cold sore on the lip" I think I died from laughter and came back to life only to listen to what he says the rest of the movie. I had heard of this film before, but never got around to watching it, and I'm glad I made the decision to finally view it! Absolutely hilarious! I think the best part of the movie is that even though all the dialogue was written over 50 years ago, the humor still applies and even seems fresh in parts. Silliness is prevalent throughout the movie but they way the filmmakers present this wacky situation is flawless. Loved it, go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you told me that this movie is why they call a B movie by that name, I wouldn't be surprised. This movie has one of the lowest budgets I have ever seen. But of course that doesn't make it bad, in fact this movie is actually really good. The writing was really good in this movie, it was exceptionally witty and smart. The acting was really good in this movie too, especially for a bunch of no name actors (at the time). The plant in this movie is also pretty good looking, especially towards the end of the movie. I'm guessing majority of the budget was spent on the final stage of the plant. This is a classic movie and I recommend everyone to watch it.</fullReview>

Jonathan Haze was perfect he kept the character boyish but also had a hint that he really didn't know what was going on. The plant was hilarious it made me laugh through the whole movie it was not what I expected. Myrtle Vail was the best for the scenes that she was in she added a weird mother to the movie that took the attention away from everything else that was going on in that moment.

		<shortDescription>Funny and unique quickie from Roger Corman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shot in just two days by B-movie maestro Roger Corman, this micro-budget horror-comedy tells the story of a florist's assistant who cross-breeds a plant that turns out to be a man-eater. With his business struggling and his idiotic assistant Seymour (Jonathan Haze) causing more trouble than good, Gravis Mushnik (Mel Welles) doesn't know where to turn. But as Seymour's oddity grows bigger by the day, it starts to attract the crowds. The only problem is, the bigger it gets, the more food it needs, and available human flesh isn't that easy to come by. If this wasn't hard enough, Seymour also has to romance the dippy Audrey (Jackie Joseph), and take care of his hypochondriac mother who thinks a bowl of baby oil makes a good meal.The fact that it was shot in two days using the leftover sets of a previous production is quite amazing, even though the film isn't exactly of high quality. The problem is that it really shows. The lack of time didn't exactly open up opportunities for anything other than mundane camera-work and shaky sets. The main setting, the florists, basically has two cameras pointing to the centre from different sides, and the whole feels like a sitcom rather than a feature. Of course, this is Roger Corman, and things like that don't really matter in his films. They are about entertainment and shameless exploitation, and the film is both.What surprised me the most about the film is how genuinely funny it is. What lacks in visual flair is made up for in the script, which is fast- paced, quirky and every now and then a little bit clever. It reminded me of the comedies of the Marx Brothers (of course, nowhere near the quality), where the characters would zip back and forth between jokes and innuendos. The comedy has a definite Jewish feel to it, similar to that of Woody Allen (again, nowhere near the quality).The film is also outright bizarre and inventive. An early role for Jack Nicholson sees him play a creepy and over-excited sadomasochist who pays a visit to the dentist, looking to have his teeth torn from their roots. It's the role that Bill Murray would play to hilarious effect in the musical remake starring Rick Moranis.It will hardly appease gore-hounds as there is next to none and the effects are pretty bad and very silly. But this is more comedy than horror, and it is certainly enjoyable.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roger Corman's The Little Shop of Horrors is another of his classic comedy-horror movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Roger Corman and screenwriter Charles B. Griffith's previous movie-A Bucket of Blood-The Little Shop of Horrors is another hilarious horror movie that retains its classic status today. In this one, Seymour Krelboin (Jonathan Haze) works in the flower shop for boss Mr. Gravis Mushnik (Mel Welles) with his crush, Audrey (Jackie Joseph), the only other work mate. In order to increase business (and to keep from being fired), Seymour brings an unusual plant to attract customers. He names it Audrey, Jr. I'll stop there and just mention despite some over-the-top physical comedy involving Haze, this was another great black comedy provided by Corman and Griffith. Seeing Corman regular Dick Miller as a plant-eating customer was a witty surprise. And the best part of this opus that was only filmed in two days is the patient of a sadistic dentist named Wilbur Force who is played here by the pre-legendary movie star Jack Nicholson! I mean, hearing him say "Don't stop now!" with a gleeful tone still has me in stitches! Also funny were a couple of police detectives doing "Dragnet"-like dialogue especially when one of them says "Them's the breaks!" All I'll say now is if you haven't seen this movie yet, what are you waiting for! So yes, I highly recommend The Little Shop of Horrors. P.S. Besides Griffith, actress Tammy Windsor (real name: Karyn Kupcinet) also came from my birthtown of Chicago, Ill. Griffith's grandmother, Myrtle Vail, plays Haze's mother. A relative of Griffith's, Jack, plays a tramp. And Jackie Coogan's brother, Robert, plays a drunk.</fullReview>

He's a clumsy, well meaning kid, who is in love with Audrey (Jackie Joseph), who both work for hard driving florist Mushnik (Mel Welles), who is about to give Seymor the boot, because of his incompetence. So in order to keep his job, Seymor promises Mushnik a flower, that would bring in a boat load of customers. And deliver he does, but the horrifying truth of the flower is soon revealed to poor Seymor, as the plant, Audrey II, is a flesh eater. And not just any regular beef, but human.At first he tries to feed the plant his own blood, but soon the demands grow too big. In desperation Seyomor walks around the city when he accidentally causes a rail workers death. In panic he at first tries to dumb the body, but then he ends up feed it to Audrey II, which causes the plant to grow even bigger. So now Seymor is between rock and a hard place: should he keep the fame and glory this bloodthirsty plant has bring him, or should he just destroy it before its all too late."The Little Shop of Horrors" is a well known Corman cult classic. Its crazy cast of characters ranging from a sadistic dentist to Seyomors hypochondriac mother work well and the comedic timing of the film couldn't be much better.All said, "The Little Shop of Horrors" is well executed small scale dark comedy, which has a load of charm intact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Fun With Wonderfully Demented Characters!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as I am considered, Roger Corman is a genius! In the same year in which he began his brilliant Edgar Allan Poe cycle (starring the great Vincent Price) with the mesmerizing Gothic tale "House Of Usher" (1960), he also came up with this hilarious quickie called "The Little Shop Of Horrors", an adorable black comedy that was shot within a few days, and yet became a classic. This was originally meant to be a sequel to Corman's macabre and hilarious "A Bucket of Blood" of 1959, which it isn't really. While I still prefer "A Bucket of Blood", since it is way more macabre and less slapstickish, "The Little Shop Of Horrors" is also hysterically funny, and a must-see for lovers of black comedy. Seymor Krembolin (Jonathan Haze), a clumsy assistant florist crosses several plants and creates a new plant that soon becomes the main attraction at the flower store he works in. He soon has to discover, however, that the carnivorous plant, which grows incredibly quickly, does not only hunger for flies and beetles... What follows are 70 minutes of pure fun. The amusingly macabre slapstick gags are amusing from the beginning to the end, which makes this a comedy that can easily be watched several times. My favorite aspect of "The Little Shop Of Horrors", however, are the wonderfully eccentric characters. Star Jonathan Haze is great in the lead. Dick Miller, star of "A Bucket Of Blood", plays a customer with a very peculiar appetite for flowers. Then there's a dentist whose methods are, mildly spoken, quite unorthodox. The great Jack Nicholson shines in an ingenious early role as the masochistic patient Wilbur Force. "The Little Shop Of Horrors" is no masterpiece like the Poe-based Gothic Horror productions with Vincent Price that Corman directed in the 60s, but it is definitely a hilarious little film that lovers of black comedy can not afford to miss. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Corman's most entertaining films, and thats saying a lot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Little Shop of Horrors" is a major cult favorite for a good reason. It combines multiple elements which psychotronic film fans and b-movie lovers have come to crave - gonzo humor, bizarre and unique characters, cheap production values, and a truly outrageous monster. Its one of the most consistently hilarious films ever made, and viewed today, its much funnier than the classier major studio comedies of the era (such as "Some Like It Hot"). The jokes are unsubtle and often politically incorrect when viewed today (there's a good amount of ethnic stereotypes on hand), but the film is so good natured it never becomes remotely offensive. Plus, some of the slapstick moments (particularly the needle battle in the dentist's office) border on surreal.What ultimately makes this a classic is the sheer number of memorably quirky characters on display. The protagonist is a meek nebbish who wants to do good but lacks any brains. His girlfriend is impossibly wild-eyed and naive yet still lovable. There's also a man (played by Dick Miller) who eats flowers, a nagging Jewish aunt who is continuously buying flowers for deceased relatives, a hypochondriac mother, and a pair of police investigators who are so stoic an Dragnet-like they can only react to murder with a shrug. Not to forget Audrey Jr., the plant itself, with its constant moans of "feed me".All in all, if you consider yourself a fan of Roger Corman or cult cinema, there's really no reason why you shouldn't have seen this yet. Its absolutely mandatory viewing and remains completely unique to this day. (9/10)</fullReview>

It makes more of practically every plot twist than the musical version does; Audrey is not a bubble headed blonde, Seymour isn't quite as much of a geek; the plant is a lot more sinister ...A small cult classic which is well worth watching.

		<fullReview>1960's "Little Shop of Horrors" is a B movie horror-comedy classic that's entertaining and both humorous. To me the film is most memorable for the early screen work of legend Jack Nicholson. The story is entertaining and crazy as that was so common of Roger Corman's movies, anyway it centered around a skid row flower shop of a man named Gravis who's ready to fire his loser assistant Seymour. Yet Seymour finds a discovery of talking plants he's created called Audrey Jr. and now they are in the money as business soon soars! Only the film takes an even more crazy turn as the plants develop a taste for more and more human blood to stay alive! Jack Nicholson has a very memorable scene as a pain loving masochistic in the chair of a dentist. Overall an okay movie that's very cheap made and B type to me more comedy than horror, really it's worth a watch due to the legendary Jack Nicholson being in it even though his scene was short it's very memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Silly, stupid, ludicrous, absurd, GREAT! Those are all words to describe this black comedy by king of the quickies, Roger Corman. It really is hard to believe this film was shot in two days but supposedly it's true. The story goes something like this -- Seymour works in a flower shop where he is not very popular...until, of course, he gets hold of the ultimate plant. This plant gets lots of attention and brings in plenty of customers which pleases his boss (a funny Mel Welles.) It also makes Seymour popular with the chicks. But something's not right about this plant. It feeds on human blood. At first Seymour feeds it with his own blood but it soon yells "feeeeed me" whenever Seymour is around by himself. Seymour wants to stay popular so begins killing people to quench the plants large appetite. Funny cameo's by Jack Nicholson, as a dental patient who loves pain, and Dick Miller, as a customer who is obsessed with eating flowers, make this whacked out movie even more fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Oddball Stuff From The Master Of Cheese..........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS is notorious in the "biz" for being shot in two days. This may be apocryphal, although I don't know because I wasn't there. The fact that it's a Roger Corman "quickie" that is actually good makes it all the more legendary. Corman is renown for making fast cheap exploitation pictures, but in recent years he has become a veritable icon in the world of independent film. He made movies his way, outside of the constraints the Hollywood system (although he would often copy successful formulas from industry projects). He has also launched the careers of countless well known actors and directors (Joe Dante, Ron Howard, Jonathan Demme and Francis Ford Coppola have all given him small parts in their films). If you average it out Corman has been involved, in some capacity, with about seven film projects per year, for the last fifty-one years. Being prolific does not necessarily equal greatness however and very few of his films have gained critical or financial success. In his respective field he moves what is known as quantity, but every once in a while things come together and something great emerges. This is the case with 1960's THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS.The story opens on a "skid row" flower shop that is barely making the rent. The store is run by Gravis Mushnik (Mel Welles) who is at wit's end with his incompetent employee, Seymour Krelboyne (Jonathan Haze), who can't seem to even cut flowers right. Audrey (Jackie Joseph) is the only other person who works at the shop and Seymour spends most of his time silently pining for her. One day Burson Fouch (Dick Miller) walks in, orders flowers, and begins to eat them in the middle of the store (he adds salt, of course). Now this is a guy who has probably been tossed out of every other flower shop for thirty miles around, but Mushnik tolerates him (mainly because he's buying) and it is Fouch that offers up some sage advice. What they need is a gimmick, something to draw in the high-paying customers. Seymour sheepishly states that he has been growing an exotic plant at home. Mushnik demands a success or Seymour will lose his job. The plant, which he names Audrey Jr., becomes the talk of the town and the cash comes rolling in. There's only one problem: the botanical beast must be fed human blood in order to survive......THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS was meant to be a pseudo-sequel to the Roger Corman picture A BUCKET OF BLOOD (which also starred Dick Miller), but that idea was abandoned (or I fail to see the connection). What Corman, along with his screenwriter Charles B. Griffith, has created, is a strange and fast paced black comedy. They get a lot of help from the actors who have great comedic timing, especially during scenes in the flower shop where everyone is talking over the other person. The writing for these scenes is sharp, but the cast really pulls it off (considering that most of the sequences were done in one take). The characters are another asset: there is the flower eater, a perpetually grief stricken old woman, and two coppers who exchange tragic dialogue in "Dragnet"-esque monotone (Cop#1: "My son just died."/Cop#2: "Those are the breaks. Let's role."/Cop#1: "Ok."). There is also Seymour's factitious disordered mother (played by Myrtle Vail) whose eyes light up when her son brings her a nerve tonic that is "ninety-eight percent alcohol." When Seymour brings Audrey over to the house, his mother prepares not "health food" but food prepared with health care products (epsom salts, caster oil, etc.). There is also Dr. Farb (John Shaner), a dentist who "extracts" revenge on deadbeat customers. And, of course, Jack Nicholson in an early (and oft mentioned) role as a masochistic dental patient. The fact that Corman and Griffith throw just about everything into the mix (the plant having hypnotic powers for example), and that they still manage to pull the whole thing off walks a thin line between skill and luck.Although the fact that there was a Broadway musical based on Corman's project is well known, I'll quickly retread it here. When the stage production became a hit, the story was recreated for the screen by Frank Oz in 1986. These large scale productions lose some of the oddball humor of the original though, and some of the best things are missing (the mother, the cops, the cheesy production values). The reinterpretations do fail to fully capture the manic seat-of-your-pants energy of Corman's film, but they are fun in they're own right. THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS is a film about a talking plant who eats people, but somehow the cast and crew elevate the material above camp, above cult, above inspired, to masterpiece....Alright, maybe not that far but it's still pretty good. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, anyone can tell it didn't cost much to make this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Which is never a bad thing, but the movie does look cheap and the acting even more so(apart from a small, but thoroughly funny role by Jack Nicholson). I didn't think the effects were that lousy, quite the contrary, they were fairly decent, especially given this movie was filmed over a period of two days. And the fact that the budget was minimal. The thing that bothered me the most was the set. The whole movie looked like it was a play(which, ironically it one became in the years to come) because the sets were extremely boring and sitcom-like. Imagine watching "Ned &amp; Stacey" for a long hour and you should get the picture. And I thought the movie was missing some important element and when I remembered the newer remake was a musical I knew exactly what; some witty songs to go along this minimalistic "play" of a movie. Although I haven't seen the remake yet(though look forward to it) and don't yet know how the songs worked in it I think it has to be superior to the original. The humor may be old and scarce and the actors may have been amateurs but the movie has heart. All my respect goes to Corman for making this feature length movie for such a small budget. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought the video because it was on sale at K-Mart the other day. This is a lotta fun! I had small hopes for this film, even though it spawned the mostly-enjoyable musical of the same name. But (especially for a Corman film), I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. The acting is bad, but not as bad as, say "Plan 9 from Outer Space." And the actors are funny (not the least of which is Jack Nicholson in a walk-on)! It does a great send-up of "Dragnet"-style detective stories, as the deadpan gumshoes discuss the untimely death of one of the cops' nephews: "Yeah ... that's the breaks," the cop mutters. A special award should go to Mel Welles for his hilarious turn as Gravis Mushnik. The film was apparently shot in two days, as evidenced by its decidedly poor editing. But for a B movie, the acting and plot is relatively strong, and the result is a very enjoyable black comedy which, even in its harshest moments, is tame by today's standards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the Greatest Horror-Comedy of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another film that's been sitting on my shelf for a while, I found it at a thrift store and was so excited that I had actually found a decent DVD, but alas, it took me months to finally watch it. I finally decided to sit down and watch it last night. An absolutely hilarious movie with some genuinely creepy moments is what we have here. The story is very quirky and fun, and the monster is amazing. There's also a hilarious cameo from Jack Nicholson. Great acting all over and some laugh out loud jokes make this a masterpiece in my book. If you're like me and you have this movie but haven't gotten around to watching it, stop stalling! It's awesome!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No music but man, it sings!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just HAD to write a review of this classic little Corman pic. It's one of my very favorites, and goes to show that you don't need a big budget to make an entertaining film. In this, case, the budget is almost non-existant and yet the story of Seymour Krelbourne and his potted plant monstrosity Audrey Jr. sings to you, and without the songs of the musical.Now, I probably shouldn't do this, but I have to compare at least some of the elements of this one and the film version of the Broadway musical. The excising of characters, like Seymour's hypochondriac mother who makes soup out of cough medicine, is one reason you should see this film BEFORE you see the musical Frank Oz film. The other thing is that Rick Moranis's stereotypical nerd version of our Stanley is totally unnecessary. Just watch the Jonathan Haze nebbish at work and you can see that horn-rimmed glasses are no substitute for pure characterization.Okay, so maybe the Dragnet-style cops are dated, but what possessed the writer of the musical effort to make the plant some outer-space visitor? It really isn't necessary and it adds nothing to the proceedings.I even like the Supreme-type girl group choir addition which in a musical makes narrative sense, but I really hated the outer space angle and the loss of a truly memorable character like Seymour's Mom.And this one has Jack Nicholson in an inspired black comedy performance which Bill Murray does okay but not nearly as well.But then the musical did have Steve Martin which is cool.Anyhoo, this is the one that is a keeper. The cheesiness and even the grainy black and white works for the picture and not against it.Oh, one more thing. Was it really necessary to go so broad for the Jackie Joseph character? Simplicity is still the key here. As wonderful as the performance of the Audrey in the later film musical was (she is an amazing singer to be sure and did a lot with the character) I could have done without the bouffant blonde wig and pink dress with over-sized bows. Less is more, people!One of the best of Corman's pics and a damned funny comedy. It fed me just the right amount of everything and it's music is the praises I sing. No note is flat here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Skewed, off-kilter comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS is another one of the Roger Corman quickies made on the cheap. This one was shot in just two days and it shows. It's got a one-trick storyline, takes place for the most part in a single set, and with a small group of actors involved, many of whom were Corman regulars. It could have been a load of old rubbish but it works and the major reason for that is down to the interesting, original storyline. Griffith's idea is about a sort-of Venus flytrap plant that feeds on human blood rather than flies; in essence this is a vampire story, but with a plant rather than a human. There were lots of 'killer plant' type stories being churned out in the pulp age of weird fiction and this is just like one of them. Corman chooses to play things for laughs and the result is a quirky comedy with lots of surreal humour involved.Many of the laughs come from the bizarre characters in the film. Jonathan Haze is very good as the dim-witted Seymour and Jackie Joseph shines as the beautiful object of his obsession, Audrey. Mel Welles has fun as the larger-than-life flower shop owner and there are great, minor roles for Corman regulars Jack Nicholson (hilarious as a sado-masochist) and Dick Miller (as a guy who loves eating flowers). The special effects of the killer plant are VERY limited but the ending, with the faces of the victims appearing in the blossoms, is imaginative and slightly disturbing. It's not a film that you'll want to watch more than once, and the musical remake vastly outclassed it in terms of budget and technical proficiency, but the skewed, off-kilter comedy and bizarre storyline make it worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Corman Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Corman's low-budget classic about Mushnick's flower shop on skid row where inept Seymour creates a hybrid plant, named Audrey Jr. after Seymour's co-worker and crush. Audrey II is sickly at first but once Seymour accidentally gives it some human blood, it grows quickly and is a big hit with the public, bringing in lots of new business for Mushnick. But to keep Audrey, Jr. happy and growing, Seymour must find new ways of getting it blood.It's a brilliantly creative black comedy, with a script by Corman and Charles B. Griffith. There just wasn't anything else quite like this when it was released. It does owe a little to another fun Corman and Griffith black comedy, A Bucket of Blood. The cast is made up of mostly forgotten actors today but they're all wonderful. Jonathan Haze and Jackie Joseph are likable as Seymour and Audrey. Myrtle Vail is a hoot as Seymour's hypochondriac mother. Mel Welles plays Mushnick and steals every scene he's in. The two most recognizable faces in the cast are Jack Nicholson in his famous cameo as a masochistic dental patient and Dick Miller as an oddball customer who eats flowers. The film is limited by its budget and how quickly it was shot. But those same limitations add to the charm of it as well as making it perfect for adapting to the stage, which it was in the 1980s. That version, a musical, was eventually turned into a great movie all its own. That is also the one I grew up with, having seen it many times before I ever saw this original. This is often cited as Corman's best work. That's debatable, I suppose, but it certainly has to be considered pretty high on the list. Very few of his films have stood the test of time and resonated quite the same as this one. It's a unique and funny movie with colorful characters and a good script. Love that ending!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original Little Shop of Horrors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before it became a hit musical which was later adapted into the popular 1986 musical film, Little Shop of Horrors was this, a B-movie at it's best. For a film that was shot over the course of a few days, I was impressed by. The cinematography isn't daring because of this, but the film's best asset is in it's style. It's dark and farce at the same time, strangely, the two go well together in this universe. The plot is simple, a boy working in a florist's shop creates a strange plant that feeds on human flesh and blood. The more it eats, the stronger and larger it becomes, it even develops the ability to talk and hypnotize people to do it's bidding. I personally am more of a fan of the musical film version, but it's nice to see it's roots. Director Roger Corman does a good job at tying all of it together for it's short production schedule. Hats off to Jack Nicholson, who manages to make a cameo in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay movie. A little strange</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening credits of this movie were very interesting in my opinion. The sketched buildings were very appealing since that is a different approach to introducing a movie. The music is very entertaining and flows along very well with the movie. I liked the voice over in the beginning as the credits were rolling. Seymore is a very funny character who in a way kind of reminds me of Charlie Chaplin. He is very clumsy and it works for his character. The mallet music is in a way Seymore's theme song when he is on a mission. I think it is goofy which matches his personality. It is very strange that the movie is based around a plant, and also that the plant can talk, but the plot is effective and very funny. Some scenes were were a little off synchronized with the camera angles and elements like that. But overall, it was a pretty good movie in respects to it being a B-list movie, which explains the cheesy plot and non synchronized shots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Little Shop of Horrors" is an odd finding in the black comedy barrel. It's a movie that has about as much structure as a Jenga tower; It seems that with every over-the-top moment in the plot and overreaction of the characters, the film gets to the point where you're not certain whether or not it will fall over by the next scene. I'm aware of its B-movie charm, and I've even heard that it took only two days to shoot all the footage, so it's understandable to see actors often rushing and forcing dialogue. It does make for great entertainment, however. The overall goofiness of the entire situation makes it comical in a sense. The script drops a lot of great jokes and lines, too. Jonathan Haze plays a fantastic main character, because it's fitting for him to be two-dimensional.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Now, no Novocain, it dulls the senses."Bumbling, fumbling Seymore(Jonathan Haze) works at Mushnick's Flower Shop, for an owner with a hair-trigger temper and little tolerance for his clumsiness and ineptitude. What I found humorous about LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS was the fact that Mushnick, a flower salesman not only hates what he sells but is too easily angered to work in customer service. He is one outburst away from a coronary and struggling to survive with a business that doesn't produce isn't exactly helping matters any.Seymore has a domineering mother(Myrtle Vail) who always goes on about how ill she is even though a doctor's report claims she's so fit she "could play fullback for the Rams." Seymore is an easy victim who has few opportunities to rise above mediocrity, a likable but vulnerable chap, a bit dim-witted and *awe shucks*, whose unusual plant may be the only saving grace which can help him keep his worthless job as a flower preparer and courier. The unusual plant, he names Audrey, Jr. after a girl who works at the flower shop, is essentially a giant mouth which chops open and shut when desiring sustenance. The plant seems to be dying until Seymore cuts his finger, and the blood seems to encourage a voracious appetite which leads to its growth at a stunning rate. But without a continual blood supply Audrey, Jr. will cease to exist. When the plant talks ("Feed me!"), Seymore, dumbfounded and surprised, will try to keep it from getting malnourished, but how will he be able to provide the needed blood to satiate its thirst?The plot, a talking plant which loves to eat humans, is preposterous, but that's part of what has made this an enduring cult classic. The subject matter is certainly ghoulish: how Seymore, who accidentally lends a hand in a drunkard's demise, splattered by an oncoming train, getting rid of the evidence by feeding the victim's remains to Audrey, Jr. which only leads to inescapable consequences for the feckless misfit. The scene where Mushnick finds Seymore feeding a foot to Audrey, Jr. is too wonderfully absurd not to laugh. Of course because he's making a profit from Audrey, Jr., Mushnick won't inform the police and instead decides to benefit from its popularity. The deranged screenplay doesn't stop there. Seymore, with a serious toothache, decides to go to the worst dentist imaginable, known to torture his customers, and the result ends tragically in another victim at the hands of this dufus. It's only a matter of time before the cops start coming around to ask questions, particularly since the man hit by the train was a detective! There's even a Society of Silent Flower Observers of Southern California who wish to present Seymore with a trophy for his plant! Charles B Griffith has provided a lot of amusing scripts for Corman during their early days prior to the great Poe films with Price, but LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS is one of his most warped and wacky.A great cast includes Jackie Joseph, a delight as bubble-headed but sweet Audrey, who is committed to Seymore until he starts "raving" about the plant and its true nature. Mel Welles as Gravis Mushnick is also a treat, with a funny scene where he uses Audrey, Jr. to save himself from a dangerous thief, willing to conceal the deadly secret of the plant devouring folks until Seymore wins the trophy. Corman/ Dante regular Dick Miller has a hilarious cameo as a patron who comes into the flower shop to buy carnations for eating purposes! Oh, and you know I can dare not leave out a totally bizarre cameo by Jack Nicholson as an undertaker with a demented enjoyment for pain, so gleeful of his visit to the dentist office that he practically has an orgasm when a nervy Seymore (having just killed the real dentist) pulls a tooth. When Seymore feeds an entire man to Audrey, Jr., followed by a belch, you kind of understand why it has such a reputation! Another visitor to the flower shop, quite a regular since she seems to lose relatives at an exorbitant rate, is Ms. Shiva(Leola Wendorff), always with a sob story (seems forced so she can get a cheaper rate for flowers she purchases). The ending, when some buds blooming unveil Seymore's misconduct, just accentuates the film's overall black comic tone. The film does parallel A BUCKET OF BLOOD is many aspects, such as the dense hero and final chase by the cops after their criminal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is there any soundtrack available for this one? (CD or Vinyl)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This little movie holds up quite well over 50 years - a B classic in its own right - but I wonder: Was there ever a soundtrack available of Fred Katz' jazzy, whimsical alto sax score? At times it reminds me of some of Jerry Goldsmith's later work for "Planet Of The Apes" and Sonny Rollins' "Alfie". It is quite extraordinary what Corman was able to accomplish with such a limited budget - the equivalent of about a half million $$ nowadays. All the participants certainly had their heart in this one, for little or no pay - kind of the equivalent of what the French 'nouvelle vague' was attempting at the time. In any case, let me know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roger Corman... love him or hate him, you can't claim he isn't/wasn't just about the most lucrative person in the film-industry. His films have little to no budget, are made in about the time it takes for the film to be put in the camera for the usual studio picture, use sets that have been used before or will be again(which he gets for next to nothing, because they were going to be torn down) and he made more than one film a year... well, so many times that he managed to direct over fifty films in about fifteen years. No, no typo. Sure, his films are hardly the greatest work committed to celluloid... and unlike Robert Rodriguez, his made-for-nothing films *look* made-for-nothing. You could probably blindly pick any of his films and use it to show someone unaware of it what a B-movie is. But they aren't bad, for being such. This is more or less a one hour, ten minute sick joke(or maybe rather one hour and ten minutes worth of such jokes)... but I found it very, very funny. Some of the humor is slapstick(one or two sequences are downright like the work of Benny Hill) and otherwise silly, and yes, at times it can be... not the most wonderful thing in the world to sit through(though there were times where I couldn't help but laugh), but the dark comedy is absolutely golden at times(and seldom, if ever, bad), and I definitely found it worth sitting through the rest. There are some good jokes in and of the characters, playing up the stereotypes, including a Jewish one and a powerfully dead-panned police detective. The film's cast includes several relatives of the writer... and the writer himself, in more than one part. Haze isn't bad, Miller is about the same. Jack Nicholson is instantly recognizable(though do not be fooled if you see a copy of this with the same cover as I did, which was little else other than the man... he only has a small role; you might be disappointed if you watch it solely for him... personally, I regarded his appearance a bonus, I watched it because of Corman), and considerably more animated than in The Terror, as well as more memorable. His mannerisms are there, even this far back. The film isn't for the faint of heart... there isn't as much gore and blood, nor is it as strong, as at least what I've seen of his horror efforts, but there is some. The effects are remarkable at times, and always passable. I recommend this to any fan of Corman and/or dark comedy. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a serious piece of work it would have failed miserably; as it is it's a gem.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seymour Krelboyne, an inept but well-meaning assistant at Gravis Mushnik's Skid Row flower shop, is haplessly in love with fellow shop assistant Audrey. When Mushnik threatens to fire him unless his work improves Seymour brings in a plant of his own, a unique one that he's been propagating at home and which he calls 'Audrey Jnr.', hoping it will interest the customers and get him back into Mushnik's good books. It works and the shop is suddenly bustling with new customers. Unfortunately Seymour discovers that Audrey Jnr. needs a special kind of food to keep it alive: Human blood. And the bigger it gets, the more it needs, but without the plant he will not only lose his job but also his beloved Audrey...With a working title of THE PASSIONATE PEOPLE EATER, LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS is very similar in plot (?) line to Corman's offering of the previous year, A BUCKET OF BLOOD (not surprisingly also written by Griffith) in which Dick Miller, the plant chewing Burson Fouch ('I like to eat in these little out of the way places') of LITTLE SHOP (and who would play in many other later Corman and similar genre flicks), plays a Seymour-esquire nerdish character working in a Bohemian café and who is jealous of his artistic customers. One day, after accidentally killing his landlady's cat and encasing it in plaster to conceal his crime, he is suddenly acclaimed as a brilliant sculptor. Obviously to maintain the illusion he must produce more works of art and, like LITTLE SHOP, things start to get nightmarishly, but amusingly, out of hand. A BUCKET OF BLOOD doubtless served as a dry run for this slicker and funnier follow up.With a script written in a week and filmed, according to Corman, in two days and one night, LITTLE SHOP makes Robert Rodriguez' EL MARIACHI pale into insignificance as an exercise in low-budget movie making. Corman even made use of an existing store-front set to serve as Mushnik's flower shop and had to rush filming before the set was due to be demolished. The beauty of this piece though is that the low (reportedly $22,500) budget doesn't matter. Other low-budget B-movies suffered because they were over ambitious, took themselves too seriously and were consequently let down by their meagre budget. LITTLE SHOP does none of this. It accepts its limitations and glorifies in them. Its many charms are probably, and most likely, a result of the rushed filming, like the fact that the shop owner's name listed in the credits is Mushnik, but the sign outside the shop reads 'Mushnick's'. With its witty black comedic script, its bizarre scenario, its preposterously melodramatic performances, its quirky, sleazy jazz score and it being a parody of those other B-movies, the cardboard sets are totally appropriate. As a serious piece of work it would have failed miserably; as it is it's a gem.Roger Corman himself cites this as the movie that established him as an underground legend. Screenwriter Charles Griffith, who had also penned IT CONQUERED THE WORLD ('56), ATTACK OF THE CRAB MONSTERS ('57), the aforementioned BUCKET OF BLOOD and would go on to write, amongst many others, PLEASE DON'T EAT MY MOTHER ('73), DEATHRACE 2000 ('75), and SWINGING BARMAIDS (aka EAGER BEAVERS (no; I don't believe it either) ('75)), also appears as an ill-fated hold-up man and gave voice to the insatiable Audrey Jnr. with the infamous bellowing cry 'Feed me! Feed me now!'. The film also importantly features Jack Nicholson in his first feature role, albeit about five minutes, as a masochistic dental patient, a role in which he takes a relish that hints of things that were to come.Wherever you acquire it, it's a minor classic, retaining the rough edge that the subsequent stage and movie musical versions sadly polished away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With an easygoing flair for the kitsch of the 1960's, Roger Corman's original "Little Shop of Horrors" is a fine mix of horror and offbeat humor (the less seriously you take it, the better). Seymour is a lonely nebbish working for the thickly-accented Gravis Mushnick, the proprietor of a struggling flower shop; when Seymour brings in a curious Venus Flytrap that grows to an enormous size, he becomes the talk of the town...even though his pet project can only be sustained by the flesh and blood of humans. Even though the humor doesn't always connect, the film is innocent, playful, and immediately engaging; it also contains early screen roles for Dick Miller and Jackie Joseph ('The Futtermans' in the "Gremlins" films), plus an extremely odd cameo by a young Jack Nicholson, who plays a dental patient turned on by pain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roger Corman vented forth this weird and weirdly funny little movie that became a cult classic the minute it hit theatre screens in the 1960s. The story, of course, has been made famous by the later New York musical and the film it spawned: an incompetent floral shop worker grows a plant so weird looking that it boosts business at his employer's skid-row shop; trouble is, the plant requires regular feeding, and its food of choice is whatever body part happens to be, er, handy!Mel Welles, who plays Mushnick, is very entertaining, and Jack Nicholson makes his screen debut with a really wild performance as the masochistic dental patient, but for the most part the cast is no-name; likewise the production values are non-existent, and print quality is usually mediocre at best. The script, however, is rather witty, taking swipes at everything from hypochondria to garden club ladies to television's DRAGNET. The whole thing is extremely uneven, but that's part of the charm. Some viewers will find the joke isn't as funny in execution as it is in concept, and the film tends to drag a bit toward the end, but cult film fans are sure to love it!Gary F.

		<fullReview>I swear that this film actually gets funnier every time I view it. It's one of the few movies that can do that. So, it was a movie that was shot in just two days. *pfft* If this is the result of a two-day shooting, more films ought to be low budget and shot with 24 hours! This is an incredible film in a category of it's own. In my opinion, it was Roger Corman's best and I'm sure that it would be a full-fledged classic, instead of a cult classic, if more people had a chance to see it. Seriously, folks, if you ever come across this film, don't pass up the chance to view it. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (the following is for people who read my review for "Little Shop of Horrors" (1986))BTW, I love the musical, too. I wrote a review of that as well, but when I wrote it, I hadn't seen the movie in a while. I think that for the most part, my review was pretty accurate, but I'd like to correct myself on one thing: Bill Murray did not *subtly* give off gay undertones, compared to Jack Nicholson. The undertones that Jack Nicholson gave in the original film were very funny, and like some of the other jokes in the film, ahead of its time, but Bill Murray just went totally wild and turned the subtext from the original film into maintext.

		<shortDescription>EXTREMELY BIZARRE, BUT SOMEHOW FUNNY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Corman's "The Little Shop of Horrors" was made on a budget of $30,000 and looks it. But that's a good thing with a movie like this. Like its' predecessor "A Bucket of Blood", it is supremely silly. But "Little Shop" is somehow funnier, probably due to its' extremely bizarre premise.No need to go into the story because you probably know it already, most likely from the 1986 big-budget musical remake with Steve Martin and Rick Moranis. While that film has good music and hilarious comedy (especially Bill Murray as the dental patient)and is an overall better film than this original, how can you not enjoy this?There are very funny performances here. Dick Miller (from "A Bucket of Blood")plays Fouch, a man who can't stop eating flowers. This is itself not very funny, but Miller plays it very straight and slyly and the result is a wonderful comic performance, different from his "Bucket" one. Jack Nicholson has Murray's role here. Although he's only on screen for about 4 minutes, it's a scene stealer and a sign of good things to come. Mel Welles is Mushnik, the Little Shop owner who hates the plant and what it does, but loves money so much, he turns the other cheek. It's mainly a collection of stereotypes, but Welles does such a good job that one can forgive it. He deserved an Oscar nod.The film's budget was so low that Corman lifted the entire music score from "A Bucket of Blood". However, the score fits this film much better than the previous film. In fact, aside from a few details, this film is a variation of "Bucket". But "Bucket" had a few flaws that prevented it from eventually reaching greatness. "Little Shop" is not without flaws, but it's much more entertaining. It has a goofy charm that big budget films can't give us.***1/2 out of 4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all know Roger Corman made some pretty lame ones, but thankfully, he had his exceptions, like this little gem. the plot is a virtual spoof of horror films, dealing with a large plant that eats people, and the schmoe who takes care of him (Her? It?). Yes, Roger made sure to include all of his friends in this one - Jonathan Haze as Seymour, the schmoe (I'm surprised, at the rate he kills people, that he never killed a person before,) Dick Miller as a guy who eats plants, Mel Welles as Muschnick, who has a hilarious, hard-to-place accent, and, as everyone knows, Jack Nicholson as a sadisitc dental patient. When it's good enough to be remade into a musical, you know it's good (like Seymour says, "There's no accounting for people's tastes."). And remember, it was made in two days, in true Roger Corman tradition!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's A Cult Classic, Not A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one is going to watch "The Little Shop Of Horrors" and think that it's a masterpiece. It isn't. Really not in any way. The performances are at best OK for the most part, the story is silly, the sets are bare bones, the man-eating plant looks ... well ... not very scary at all. Just silly. But of course, you're making a mistake if you watch this expecting to find a masterpiece. It hasn't become known as a cult classic for no reason. It has pretty much everything you'd want to find in a cult classic. In its silliness, it's fun pretty much the whole way through. Interspersed among the "OK" performances is actually a pretty good one by Mel Welles as Gravis Mushnick, a flower shop owner whose store is on skid row, so he doesn't make much money. When his employee Seymour (Jonathon Haze) develops a new plant, it's a chance for Gravis to make money by getting people into the store to see the new plant and hoping to get them to buy flowers while they're there. Unfortunately, the new plant is a man-eater, and Seymour ends up having to find its food for it. There's a bit of a spoof of the TV show "Dragnet" going on, revolving around a couple of local cops assigned to find the people who've gone missing (after being fed to the plant.) There's even a very early role for Jack Nicholson as a guy who loves having pain inflicted on him by dentists!It's not a masterpiece. Not at all. Not in any way. But it has more than enough going for it to deserve the status of cult classic that it's gained. And you'll never hear the words "Feed Me!" again after watching this and not think about this movie!

		<fullReview>This movie is definitely a must see and quite an entertaining movie to watch. It tells the story of a man-eating plant that save's a dying business. The acting was great throughout the black &amp; white film and the photography was excellent as well and was able to capture the many different angles and look of the plant. The lighting was great as well even in the dark scenes. One of my favorite aspects of the movie would be how Mushnick would get jealous whenever the girls acknowledged that Seymour was the brains behind Audrey Jr (the plant).Overall I rated the film a 9 out of 10; I've seen both this version and the newer version and would recommend either one to someone looking for a good laugh!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Say what you will about Roger Corman movies, but the man had/has a knack for the obviously absurd. It was not until I got older than I really "got" Corman, and his Little Shop of Horrors is a perfect example of how to do it right, and the first time (for cult classics). You can tell the budget was low, but somehow that's what also makes this movie work (pay attention to the street scenes on Skid Row). And how come in his night scenes we can see what's going on, but in a lot of movies out today we cannot? The casting was perfect, and Haze as Seymour could not be any better. He plays the part of the klutzy and nebbish young man perfectly. His physical comedy was spot on. Also catch the names of the characters Corman gives. An absolute hoot. But what (who) was really funny was Audrey Jr. That voice. That pleading, Feed me....feed me....FEED ME NOW! reminded us of our teenage son, which of course makes this movie even funnier for us. Sure, there are no special F/X and Audrey Jr. is as poorly made as they came, even for back then, but the voice for Audrey Jr. more than makes up for it. Much better than the remake (which is actually a musical with a smart-mouth Audrey 2 and not funny at all, even when he pleads, Feed Me). Check both of them out and make up your own mind, but the original cannot be beat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Starving Actor... hard to believe Jack Nicholson was once one of them, right?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's so funny because I had such a hard time deciding on what I should rate this film, I haven't seen a terrible, but yet such a guilty pleasure type of film that is so bad that it just makes you laugh all over again. Not to mention, you can't help but just go crazy over Jack Nicholson's role, this was one of his first's, he's such a baby, but you can tell even back in his day he loved being the clown and making people laugh. The thing about this movie, this is not the musical, so this was more of a sci-fi with a mixture of dark humor, it even has some attempt at good old fashioned drive through horror. This is such a low budget film, you can tell by the bad effects, the unknown actors(excluding Jack, even though he was a no-name at the time), and the way the film is made. But there is something so campy about this film, as cheesy as it is, you do enjoy it on some levels.Seymour works for Mr. Mushnik at a flower shop that isn't doing too well and it's about to go bankrupt. Seymour is constantly being threatened by Mr. Mushnik about loosing his job, but the love of his life Audrey always defends him, and Mr. Mushnik cuts him some slack since Seymour takes care of his sick mother. But one day Seymour brings in a plant that looks like a fly trap that all of a sudden attracts a lot of customers and brings business and life back into the flower shop. But there is only one type of food that this plant needs to stay alive and grow... human blood, leading Seymour into a murderous second life that has everyone scared for their lives on who will be next to feed this mighty plant.The Little Shop of Horrors, well, even though I prefer the musical, in some ways it made more sense as a musical vs. a cheesy sci-fi movie that really had some disturbing humor, but it's fun for what it was. Like I said, it feels like one of those old drive in movies that had you cuddling with your sweet heart, all because of a man eating plant. The acting is bad, the effects are horrible, the editing is terrible, but for some odd reason, I think we can all have a little bit of fun with this movie. As bad as these movies are, there's something special about them, I think because the cast looked like they were just having fun together and they did try to make a fun movie, so you have fun with them in this campy movie.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't decide which movie to watch for Roger Corman's 81st birthday: Little Shop of Horrors or The wasp Woman. This movie won and it is a fitting tribute.Corman, who allegedly could negotiate the production of a film on a pay phone, shoot the film in the booth, and finance it with the money in the change slot, shot this film in two days and one night on a set that was left over from someone else's production.It is a classic featuring a very young Jack Nicholson as an undertaker who loved pain in his third film. The face that was to later become famous in The Shining was very evident.Jonathan Haze played the lead as the clumsy Seymour who invents the man-eating plant. Haze worked exclusively for Corman until he quit acting for behind the stage work.This is an extremely low budget feature, but it is funny and many of the laughs are from Seymour's girlfriend Audrey (Jackie Joseph) and his mother. They alone are worth the price of admission.So, Happy 81st Birthday, Roger.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Little Shop of Horrors is vintage Corman! It has a little of everything. It has horror, definitely. It also has comedy, absurdity, outrageousness and of course the ever-present screwball characters that seems to find their way into every Corman film. Low budget does not mean less quality here. This is worth the watch. It's too bad they don't have theatres anymore where you could watch a series of Corman's greatest B movie classics. This ranks up there with The Wasp Woman, Creature From the Haunted Sea, Beast From the Haunted Cave and the Masque of the Red Death as some of Corman's early,low budget classics. While, not your typical scary monster movie, this low budget gem is worth the renting. Thanks you, Mr. Corman!</fullReview>

The whole cast is perfect, from Jonathan Haze in the main role as Seymour to Jack Nicholson in a small role as masochistic dental patient. Roger Cormans (and Joe Dantes) regular actor Dick Miller also has good part as the flower eating Burston Fouch. Also worth mentioning are the two policeman, who are hilarious in the few scenes they appear. I think this is a must film for anyone to see, dont let the reputation as the film that was made in weekend fool you, this is pure stuff, one of the greatest horror-comedies ever made.

		<shortDescription>Cult classic does well with tiny budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, it's 40 years old. Sure, it was infamous as the film shot in two days (and it shows!). But there's a lot to be said for this short film with small production values. The audio quality on the tape I viewed was not very good, but the quality of the script sure was! Before the Broadway musical and subsequent movie, this classic penned by Charles B. Griffith was positioned not as a light musical romp but as a dark horror/comedy. What do you have? Well you have a tiny plant that apparently grows stronger when fed human blood; so, in order to keep the plant (and his job and his love life) intact, lovable nebbish Seymour goes out and kills....and kills. Throw in a sadistic dentist and a masochistic patient (played to the hilt by a very young Jack Nicholson, in his Corman days), and you have yourself a black comedy. It's short, it's sweet, and it's not something you bring a date to see, but it's pure cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Little Shop of Horrors, The (1960) *** (out of 4) A dorky flower lover (Jonathan Haze) gets the perfect Venus Flytrap but the only catch is that it needs human meat to survive. This is the rather legendary Corman picture that took 2-days to shoot and it certainly looks it but that's certainly not something negative. It's rather amazing at how well the film turned out considering the budget and shooting time so it makes you wonder why talented directors can't do better with a twelve-month shoot and a hundred million dollars. Haze is terrific in his role and really captures the dorkiness of his character. His weak nature really comes through perfectly and makes for a very funny character. Mel Welles and Dick Miller, two Corman regulars, are also very funny in their roles. It's the pre-fame Jack Nicholson that makes the biggest slash however with his pain loving character. I'm not sure if you watched this in 1960 if you would be able to tell what Nicholson would turn into but there's no doubt he had an excellent comic timing then. Charles B. Griffith also deserves special attention for the voice of the plant and what an excellent voice it is with the constant 'feed me' screams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the non-musical original, klutz Seymour Krelboyne is played with a right bumblingness by Jonathan Haze. He works at Mushnick's Flowers along with Audrey (Jackie Joseph, who I don't think is as good as Ellen Greene) and Mr. Mushnick himself (Mel Welles). Seymour finds a new plant and tries to feed it, but it's sick. Nevertheless, it's like nothing anyone has ever seen. After pricking his finger by accident, Seymour finds out that Audrey Jr. (the plant) likes blood. Soon he gets in over his head.It's a fine movie, a couple laughs here and there, but I liked the comedy-musical-horror version of the new one more. It did start off immediately and went quickly (of course, it's 70 minutes long).Look for Jack Nicholson as a masochistic dental patient. As I look at what I've written, it's not much, but there isn't really much else to say except that it has cheesy special effects but is still enjoyable.My rating: 5/10Not Rated</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roger Corman directs a script by Charles B. Griffith; filming two days and one night coming up with a black comedy masterpiece. A low budget success that quickly became a cult classic. A hapless nerd(Jonathan Haze)in order to keep his job at the Mushnick Flower Shop creates a hybrid plant that needs human blood to flourish. Seymour(Haze)names the plant after his girlfriend Audrey(Jackie Joseph). Why is it fun to laugh at serious situations? Also in the cast are Dick Miller, Wally Campo and a young Jack Nicholson with a hilarious bit part. Haze is convincing as the bumbling idiot. Joseph is so irritating it hurts. Merri Welles is fetching as the looker hooker. The special effects are bad enough to make this a hoot to watch and believe it or not is superior to the remake in 1986.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as i like seeing Rick Moranis sing horribly, and Bill Murray get his rocks off on pain, i never really liked the musical remake of this movie. I just don't like musicals. The best part of this film was the fact that it kept its dark comedy feel that inspired the remake. Roger Corman is best known for his b movies, and this is probably one of his most famous. It's got such a cheesy, unbelievable plot, and such flimsy acting and overall horrible sets, but it doesn't even matter because we as the audience know it's supposed to be funny. We know this was Cormans intention and it makes the whole thing much much easier to endure. I thoroughly enjoyed the original movie to the remake because there wasn't much of an excuse for the remake. Corman made this in a time when this was what was popular. The remake was done when b-movies weren't really excused, and it was also made a musical? Thats just asking to be placed on the 100 worst films of all time list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Roger Corman's cult classic that took two days and $27,000.00 to produce has flower boy,some ten years before the term flower children came into existence, Seymore Krelboyne, Jonhatan Haze, developed this plant that turns out to be his biggest nightmare. It turns out that the plant Audrey Jr named after Seymore's girlfriend Audrey Fulquard, Jackie Joseph,lives exclusive on human blood! And to keep it alive Seymore has to find victims for it to feed on or else he'll in fact become it's next meal! Working on L.A's skid row flower shop owner Gravis Mushnick, Mel Wells, is having trouble in having ends meet with his employee Seymore always screwing everything up for him. It's when Seymore brings his plant Audrey Jr to Mushnick's flower shop as an exhibit people begin to flock to Mushnick's by the thousands in order to see it. That also has them buy flowers from his store which ends up getting Mushnick out of debt and foreclosure. Meanwhile behind the scenes Seymore has to dig up live bodies to keep his man and woman eating plant both alive and happy. That's until it ends up ruining his life, with Audrey leaving him, and with that drives Seymore off the deep end.The story told to us in flashback by LAPD Detectve Sgt.Fink, Wally Campo, and his blood sniffing partner Det.Frank Stollie, Jack Warford, is a true modern day horror in both murder an cannibalism if in fact the plant, by it being able to speak English,is human and the cover up b Seymore of the ghastly crimes it committed. Not only does the plant commit murder but even worse gets the innocent Seymore, by blackmailing him, to join in. At first trying to keep the secret of his plants thirst for blood from the police Seymore himself gets involved in providing the plant with blood that makes him and accomplice to the very crimes that it ends up committing. ***SPOILERS*** With no turning back and blood on his hands Seymore in the end faces the inevitable,life behind bars or worse,and sacrifices himself to the man eating plant that,like Dr. Henry Frankenstein's Monster, he in fact created and in the end,like it's many victims,becoming a part of it! Besides Seymore and Mr.Musnick there's a number of very interesting characters in the movie that makes it successful. Among them a young 23 year old Jack Nicholson as pain freak Wilber Force who forces Seymore, whom he mistakes for his dentist,to pull his teeth out without the use of Novocaine so he can enjoy,like Dustin Hoffman didn't in "Marathon Man", every painful second of it. Nicholson had already put Hollywood on notice the year before in his earth shattering film debut as Jimmy Wallace in the movie "Cry Baby Killer" to what wild and crazy things to expect from him in he future. P.S The man eating plants voice was provided by Charles B. Griffith who was also one of it's, as the flower shops stick-up man, victims.</fullReview>

Now I first saw the musical version from the 80's with Rick Morranis which personally I loved, but doesn't get much praise here. I was quiet surprised with how much I love the older version after I picked up a copy with remastered sound and refined picture quality. The original is much funnier then the re-make and the acting is much better then Rick Morranis (not hard to be a better actor). In all I have taken the original as my favorite of the two movies.

The audio was bad, but that doesn't matter because the script was bad. It was a far-fetched horror movie, that was more comical than scary. It was a bust with small parts of entertainment and comedy.The only highlight of this film is the appearance of the ever so young Jack Nicholson.

I've never really understood the meaning in that scene.Does Krelbourne get inside the plant-- A: originally in an attempt to destroy the plant from the inside, or B: because his guilt over murdering and butchering people for the plant to eat drives him to commit suicide?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, underrated film; worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I re-watched this movie last night after not seeing it for years. As it turns out, it was better than I remembered. Lots of jokes go by quickly, and you have to listen close to get them all. Look out for Mushnick's English problems("Does [the plant] have a scientific name?" "Of course, but who could denounce it?"). The thing that makes these little things funny is they are off to the side, said quickly and moved along. It's not like a joke as seemingly weak as the one above is said real loud, and given ample time for a rimshot; this is said and then we move on quickly. This film is full of little chuckles and funny dialogue, but is not loaded down with huge guffaws and side-splitting gags. Certainly, this little shop is full of little laughs, but they keep going and keep your attention.By the way, the listing in the main cast list on the IMDB for this film says Seymour's last name is "Krelboined." I think they missed the joke: His name is Krelborn(as his boss calls him), but his accent made it so he pronounced it, when asked, as "Krelboin." I could be wrong, but that was what I got out of it.Finally, I have to say: When they packaged this with 2 other Corman movies for DVD, why didn't they include Bucket of Blood? They were both the same story with slightly different elements(instead of someone accidentally killing people to feed to a plant, he accidentally kills them to make statues out of. Otherwise, it's the same story), and they go well together. If *any* movie should be packaged with tLSoH, it should be Bucket of Blood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Feed me Seymour! Omg! I always loved this movie and was pleased to see it as one of the movies I had to write about. This movie is straight forward with some great scenes. I guess I can compare it to the one that was done in the late 80's, even though that one is way better. This movie was in black white, I'm not a fan of black n' white movies, because there's no enthusiasm in it for me. However I over looked that and stuck to the acting and plot which was quite interesting and well played out. I just hate the ending because I hate to see him go. This movie was fun to watch being able to compare it to the one done over in the 80s. my favorite part in this film is when the plant ask for more of his blood and he replies 'I'm already anemic " that was to funny, like if you should be even thinking about giving it any more of your blood. This entire movie is a tremendous classic in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My school put on "Little Shop"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And I'm proud to say our version more resembled this version than the 1986 remake. Like this, we had no songs (except for the Dentist song which I did as I was the Dentist) and had the "the plant wins" ending. As a man who put this on, let me rate this movie based on each performance.Seymour: Words cannot describe how much more I like the 60 Seymour better than the 86 Seymour. I mean, in 86, Seymour was some whiny dork who sang songs in a basement. He had dorky glasses and clearly wasn't a cold blooded killer. Here, he is not like this at all. The 60 Seymour is bad ass. I mean, he stabs the Dentist in the neck with a scalpel and bangs the hot chick on the head with a boulder. He is psychotic, manipulative, and down right evil (and in my humble opinion, reminiscent of Jon Voight's Paul Sarone in "Anaconda"). I am pleased to say, my production's Seymour was like this too.Mushnik: I much prefer the 60 Mushnik to the 86 one. Here, he fills in a void that the 86 one lacks, the hero. Sure Seymour acts the hero part in 86, but he is no hero. Not like Mushnik here anyway. Mushnik actually has a personality. He isn't just some unnecessary man begging to be eaten like in 86. I give him props.Audrey: Here, I actually prefer the 86 version. Audrey was hardly a main character in the 60 version. All she is is just one of Seymour's many chicks, and not even his best looking one. I must give the 86 version props for creating a better character, though I guess that version combines with Leonora (who I much prefer to Audrey in 60).The Dentist: As someone who played the Dentist, I am pleased by what I saw here. Sure the role isn't as big in 60, but at least he gets a sweeter death by being stabbed in the neck in cold blood.The Plant: I prefer the 86 plant, but admire what was done with him in this version. Audrey Jr here much more resembles the legendary Ya-Te-Veo in this story than in 86 (where he's a "Mean Green Mother From Outer Space"). Plus, he gets to eat five people here as opposed the dismal total of two in 86 (how I wish it had been four as planned there).The Girls: I like 2 as opposed to 3 (probably because my production was the same).The Rest: I like a lot of the characters here who don't appear in 86, particularly Mrs. Krelboin and Leonora. In my opinion, there is no excuse for not having them in 86.Overall: I highly recommend this movie to anyone who like movies involving people getting stabbed and eaten. It is kick ass (the "Anaconda" of it's day) and a worthy owner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little Shop Of Horror: Roger Corman's Best B Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Little Shop of Horrors (1960): Starring Jonathan Haze, Jackie Joseph, Mel Welles, Dick Miller, Jack Nicholson, Myrtle Vail, Tammy Windsor, Toby Michaels, Leola Wendorf, Lynn Storey, Wally Campo, Jack Warford, Jon Herman Shaner.The 1960 Roger Corman horror film "Little Shop Of Horrors" inspired the 1980's stage musical and film. There is much to admire in this B movie, for quite honestly it's the best of director Corman's otherwise campy and badly written movies, which nevertheless enjoy cult classic fame. Jonathan Haze plays Seymour Krelborn, a shy, awkward young man who works at a flower shop owned by Mr. Gravis Mushnik (Mel Welles). He has a crush on the pretty but mysterious Audrey Fulquard. When business begins to wane, Seymour finds a rare plant which comes from nowhere and business begins to pick up. The plant is actually a predatory plant from outer space. It feeds on human blood. At first, Seymour makes the sacrifice and feeds the plant bits of his own blood. But the alien plant becomes endlessly hungry as it grows and begins to go on a rampage throughout Southern California. This odd movie is meant to be both very dark, disturbing and also tinged with elements of humor. Nevertheless, it is far darker than the musical, which can still be enjoyed by the whole family. This one is far uglier in its premise, ending tragically even. A wealth of bizarre characters appear- including a young Jack Nicholson, in what is apparently his first or second movie, as Mr. Wilbur Force, who derives pleasure, possibly sexual pleasure, from receiving intense pain from his dentist Dr. Farb (played by Jon Shaner) who in turn enjoys giving pain to his patients. There is also Mr. Burson Fouch (Dick Miller) who is a herbivore and eats plants instead of solid human food. The creepiness, often eerie silent moments, are part of this movie's best features. At this time in horror cinema, directors focused on bizarre, psycho-sexual aspects, or elements of sci-fi but were gradually becoming more disturbing and disgusting, paving the way for today's gore fests. However, unlike today's violent horror, this one is a mixture of the unusual and the tame. No moment in this film is truly that scary. It was even featured on both the hit cable series "Mystery Science Theater 3000" in which a human and robots constantly make fun of old and campy horror films while watching it and in "Macabre Theater" hosted by the Elvira-like Ivanna Cadaver and Butch Patrick of the "Munsters", another horror showcase with elements of humor. Because this movie is rather old and it was never that successful on VHS, it suffers of bad sound, at times really loud at times too quiet. The cinematography also shows its age, because the night scenes are so pitch-black one can't see what is going on. Roger Corman is still doing a great job with this film. Wonderfully frightening and spooky. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Tell The "Tooth" This Movie is Wonderful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an old movie lover, I have to say that this movie is quite cute. Although of course the effects are lame compared to nowadays, they are quite well done for the 1960's. Of course, don't expect any "jump-out-of-your-seat" horror any more than you would watching Jekyll and Hyde.The story is of Seymour, an average man that works at a plant shop. He one discovers a new breed of (talking) plant, which of course gets him a lot of publicity. However, one night the plant wilts, and Seymour discovers, much to his unpleasant surprise, that the plants feeds upon human blood. And as time escalates, the plant craves more than just blood. In order to keep the plant alive long enough for the day of his "big interview", Seymour is forced to kill other human beings of which to feed the plant.In a nutshell, that's the plot. However, my personal favorite character happens not to be Seymour at all. For those Jack Nicholson lovers, you'll adore him as Wilbur Force, the local masochist, even if he only gets a few minutes of screen time.Love it or hate it, Little Shop of Horrors is a classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superb B movie mayhem.Either by design or through a fortunate coming together of genius this movie hits all the marks. Well paced with good balance of black humour. This movie could probably stand the test of time in it's own right but the sprinkling of artists who delivered well here and went on to greater heights just adds to its fun.I'm torn between the concept of "if an infinite number of monkeys directed an infinite number of films" and Corman's personal approach "make 'em fast 'n make 'em cheap" ... he had to strike gold eventually. As a Corman fan, for me everything just comes together in a perfect storm for this one, actors, writers and director and maybe he blew an extra $50 on this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Little Shop of Horrors is supposed to be a movie version of the musical that goes by a similar name. Most of the time, movies based on musicals are often garbage, but this was better than the musical. Some of the enjoyable things of the movie is the boyfriend's love for toxic and how the main character, who is a florist, is growing a Venus flytrap bent on global conquest. The personality of the florist matches his job quite well and the one he had affection for also had her part done right. When I saw this movie, I thought about "Singin' In The Rain and realized I enjoyed them both equally for some reason. Regardless, both were amazing and they both belong together: on your selves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess that the musical is more famous, but Roger Corman's original is still worth watching. The plot of course has underpaid Seymour Krelboyne (Jonathan Haze) creating a plant that desires human blood. However, nowadays the movie is more famous because it was Jack Nicholson's film debut. He plays masochistic Wilbur Force, who goes in for a dental check-up.If the movie is worth watching only as a historical reference, then so be it. If nothing else, it is funny just for Nicholson's performance. Another appearance is B-movie regular Dick Miller (whom Joe Dante always casts as a tribute to the old B-movies). Still, I prefer Frank Oz's remake (mainly because of Steve Martin's performance).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a black comedy, "The Little Shop of Horrors" has some of the most bizarre scenes and one liners that you'll ever encounter in an American movie. Shoestring doesn't begin to describe it's frenetic pacing and lurid effects, and it all gets started with introductions at Mushnick's Florist Shop. There we meet the customers who bedevil proprietor Gravis Mushnick (Mel Welles), from the funeral a day Mrs. Shiva (Leola Wendorff) to the flower eating patron (Dick Miller) who's wife makes gardenias for dinner. However they're only a warm up for employee Seymour Krelborne (Jonathan Haze), who's trying to save his job by developing a new type of plant, the only one like it in the world. And it doesn't stop there, before it's all over, we're treated to music for old invalids from Seymour's mom (Myrtle Vail), and a strangely Jerry Lewis inspired performance by the very young Jack Nicholson.The real star though is Audrey Junior, the Venus fly trap of a monstrosity nurtured by Seymour, and named after his wannabe girlfriend (Jackie Joseph). Audrey thrives on blood, and claims victim after victim supplied by the hapless Seymour, until the long arm of the law gets too close for comfort. You'll have to see it for yourself to appreciate it's wacky humor and understated zaniness, as well as find meaning in such cleverly crafted lines as "You wouldn't find him here with the toilets, let's go back."</fullReview>

Sadly, Audrey the plant can only survive on blood, so Seymour reluctantly has to provide victims...Bizarre film is a big cult item with many, and certainly has a most offbeat sense of humor, but I found this a stupid, clumsy and grisly comedy with annoying characters and no point at all, especially in its ending. Jack Nicholson does give a most enthusiastic performance in his brief bit that seems dropped in from somewhere else...One funny bit: the "Fink" speech!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some years ago I saw the remake with Rick Moranis and I thought it was an overall hideous film. It was awful as a movie alone and the fact that it was a musical made it all the more worse.However, the destiny of this review is to comment on the original version. Now that I've seen the original, I can affirm that it's only slightly better. Even this original version is fairly ridiculous. The plot is familiar but with some differences. For example, this version is in black and white and it's not a musical. By being the original it is also more "original", of course.Mel Welles is great as the impatient florist shop owner/boss. Jonathan Haze's portrayal as the clumsy Seymour is just as great but... but... the problem is on the character himself. Seymour is supposed to be a poor devil and funny but the things he does are sick: he kills 3 people and feeds them to the vicious man-eating plant. Even if the murders he commits are accidental, it's still sick. He even feeds the plant human remains of his first victim. And apparently the third victim (the prostitute) was eaten alive by the plant.It was a surprise to see a very young Jack Nicholson. He only has a minor role as Wilbur Force, a freak patient who loves pain. Jack is hilarious as that freak. Portraying freaks has always been what he does best, that's part of his charisma.</fullReview>

They only needed to show it if it was necessary, but they did it every time. over all I think they should rethought-out this movie and gave it a better plot, acting, and ending.</fullReview>

The film is terminally lacking humour and lacks any originality. The actual idea is good and it's not surprising that other versions were made and I'm sure the live show could be fun. Be warned, Jack Nicholson is not the star of this film. He has slightly more than a cameo but I suppose that his name will help to market such a dull enterprise. Style wise it's a bit like the Adams Family but vastly inferior. I bought this as a cheap triple-movie pack and the sound quality was awful.</fullReview>

Granted, I knew what was going to happen because I'd seen the remake but the remake made more sense.

		<fullReview>The Little Shop of Horrors is set in a skid-row flower shop owned by Gravis Mushnik (Mel Welles). Mushnik has had enough of his clumsy assistant Seymour Krelboyne (Jonathan Haze) &amp; fires him, Seymour begs for his job &amp; with the help of one of his friends Audrey Fulquard (Jackie Joseph) &amp; a bizarre flower eating customer named Burson Fouch (Dick Miller) Mushnik decides to give Seymour a week to prove himself. Seymour brings the plant that he has cross bred into the shop as a sort of attraction &amp; has named it Audrey Jr. after his friend, the unusual plant feeds on human blood but is a good crowd puller so Seymour obliges with his own. However the plant begins to talk &amp; demands more blood, much more. While out walking Seymour 'accidently' causes the death of a railroad worker &amp; with a little persuasion lets Audrey Jr. eat the parts. Seymour becomes stuck with a dilemma, Audrey Jr. is terrific for business &amp; pulls in the crowds &amp; Seymour is suddenly very popular but at the same time it likes to eat people which isn't good as Seymour has to find it's victims. Things get worse when Detective Sergeant Joe Fink (Wally Campo) &amp; his partner Detective Frank Stoolie (Jack Warford) start to figure out that something is going on &amp; begin to trace the recent missing persons back to the shop...Produced &amp; directed by Roger Corman The Little Shop of Horrors was apparently filmed in just two days on a budget of $27,000 &amp; to be brutally honest it shows, the main set wasn't even made for this film &amp; Corman simply redecorated it. Now I've nothing against low budget horror but The Little Shop of Horrors doesn't really have that much going for it. The script by Charles B. Griffith who also has a few cameos including the voice of Audrey Jr. &amp; the burglar who gets eaten piles on the comedy more than the horror. For the most part I didn't find much to laugh at although some parts are mildly amusing particularly the deadpan cops, Mushnik who talks in broken English all the time &amp; the strange flower eating customer. I felt the film went from funny to just plain silly which didn't work for me. The horror elements are confined to the fake looking plant &amp; a couple of severed limbs. At least the film is short at only 70 odd minutes so it doesn't outstay it's welcome. The acting is OK for this sort of thing &amp; Jack Nicholson turns up but I didn't recognise him. The special effects on Audrey Jr. aren't up to much &amp; as a whole The Little Shop of Horrors is technically an unremarkable film throughout with nothing to distinguish it. Worth a watch I suppose especially considering that The Little Shop of Horrors is now a public domain film &amp; you can probably find it on the internet for free &amp; I'm sure it's on DVD everywhere for next to no money. Not the classic I was hoping for though.</fullReview>

The only good thing to the film was Jacks Nicholson very first performance, he was a crack up and the only good thing to the film, the rest of the film was crap, gee the 1931 franksein was 100% better then this, this movie should have been put in the trash pile before it was release, i feel sorry for the performers who had to play in such a pile of crap of a film, i give it 2 only for Jack Nicholson. This is on of the worst monster movie eve made, even the Japanse Godzillas films are more enjoyable then this, and some them were pretty bad. The remake is one of the best remakes of if its kind, well it was made in 80's, directors knew how to make good remakes back then. For an original film, its nothing but a joke, if it puppet work, its the worst i have seen. There nothing else i can say how bad this film is, I'm surprise its even on DVD, the quality is so bad it makes the movie even worst, as its hard to see what is going on in the dark scenes, especially the scene where Seymour accitally kills a drunk hobo at the rail way yard, its night time, but the DVD is rather dark and it hard to see whats going on, you need to turn up the brightness to see what is going on.</fullReview>
