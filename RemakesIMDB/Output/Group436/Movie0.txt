		<shortDescription>Bob Hope and Jane Russel in a great western comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is quite a funny western, it is so much fun you don't want it to end. Frank Tashlin who later became a director of great comedies shared the credits for the screenplay. As a matter of fact he directed the excellent sequence of this film, "Son of Paleface". Bob Hope acts like a dumb guy, but sometimes he comes out with something that reminds you he is the famous Bob Hope who is not taking the film seriously and that works very well, making it even funnier. As for Jane Russel as Calamity Jane, the combination of being sexy and apparently a bad girl also works well. The best scene is the showdown when they give so much advice to Hope, that he gets mixed up. The song "Buttons and Bows later became a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Paleface Is What Made Jane Russell's Career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Paleface one of the funniest films Bob Hope ever did was a godsend to the career of Jane Russell. Take a look at her film credits and see how few there were during the Forties. She did The Outlaw which kept going in and out of release every time Howard Hughes re-edited it. She did a film called The Young Widow which she hated and was a box office flop and then The Paleface.Although Howard Hughes kept messing around with The Outlaw and kept Russell off the screen for most of the Forties, the man did know about publicity and certainly kept her name before the public. But a movie star has to make movies. So even Hughes realized that and I'm sure he exacted a good price for Russell's services to Paramount for The Paleface.Hope of course is his usual character. A recent graduate of a dentistry college, he's gone west to seek fame and fortune, Hope the schnook gets tangled up with the notorious Calamity Jane. Of course Russell is Calamity Jane, she's being offered a pardon in order to trap some no good outlaws selling weapons to the Indians. When her contact is killed and she nearly is also, she picks up Hope and they get married and join a wagon train.Of course the some of the funniest stuff in The Paleface when Russell does some fancy shooting and let's Hope take the credit for it, giving him an undeserved reputation for fearlessness. One of my favorite bits is when Iron Eyes Cody gets a hold of some of Hope's laughing gas and Hope thinks he's Russell behind a barrier.Bob Hope got to introduce his second Oscar winning song in The Paleface, Buttons and Bows by the Paramount contract song writers, Jay Livingston and Ray Evans. He sold a few records of it, but the real big hit was done by Dinah Shore. It's now become identified with Russell as well, but she sings it in Son of Paleface, not here.This was Bob Hope's first trip to the American west in search of laughs and it was a successful expedition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Hope comedy is fun spoof of old westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many wonderful moments in this gloriously silly movie, that it would be impossible to mention more than a few. Hope's timing, the verbal and sight gags combined, a fairly bawdy undercurrent,involving Painless Potter's unsuccessful attempts to bed his new bride, and probably the funniest parody of the classic showdown ever filmed, add up to a very entertaining movie.Some of the most priceless moments go by very quickly, and may not be obvious at first. Painless Potter is smilingly massaging the bald head of a tough dental patient, and they both begin chuckling uncontrollably, due to a leak in the laughing gas machine. Painless Potter is shaving outdoors, with a small mirror hung from a tree branch. An arrow whizzes by, and he remarks that he must be shaving too close. A very obvious man ,trying to conceal himself behind a bush, comes closer, and Potter remarks with a sort of deadpan whimsy, " Must be a Virginia Creeper." When another arrow nearly hits him, he examines it curiously, and muses aloud on who it is that shoots arrows. He lists the possibilities, including Cupid and William Tell, before shrieking " Indians!" and running for the blockhouse. When he tries to get wife Jane to let him in, he hollers, " Help, help, there's a million Indians out here against one coward!"Viewers who can let themselves get immersed in the wisecracks and sight gags, along with just about every western cliché you can think of, will have a good laugh with this delightful film.And, the scene where Painless Potter serenades his sleepy wife with a concertina, singing " Buttons and Bows", as their covered wagon moves slowly along the trail, is absolutely charming. There's something very tender about the way the naive husband sings the funny little song to his drowsy bride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably Hope's best film ? his comic style in a well structured film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gunslinger and criminal Calamity Jane is released from prison by the Governors in exchange for her help with a problem. Someone is selling guns and dynamite to the Indians and other agents have been killed trying to find out who ? only someone like Jane can get close. When her partner is killed she has no-one to act as her husband and help her travel incognito. She happens across a cowardly dentist, Painless Peter Potter, and she marries him in order to get a ride to Buffalo. However, can she keep him out of trouble long enough to find the dynamite?Bob Hope may be 100 years old as I write this but he has been out of movies for quite a few years, also he only tended to make one type of film and play the same part in each one. So the appeal of this film very much depends on whether or not you like that. Personally I love Bob Hope and enjoy him even when he is in a weak film. The Paleface is one of his best films simply because it is a good piece of all round entertainment. It has a good central plot that stops the film just being a vehicle for him to do his stuff and instead is actually going somewhere.The songs are quite nice but also there's only really two so it doesn't slow the film down too much. I do like the odd musical number but some Hope films had 5 or more songs in a 90 minute film, which was way too many. Hope is on good form, his asides and jokes work better in a good plot and he is very funny throughout. Some routines work better than others but if you are a fan then you'll like his style even when it isn't as funny as you'd hope. Russell is a good leading lady despite being a bit serious and then softening too quickly. The support cast are all in the background and the Native American clichés can be explained by the period and not racism.Overall this is a very enjoyable film that works well because it allows Hope to run free within a good film instead of simply letting his performance be the film. He wisecracks his way along and it is easy to see why his light comic style has made him an icon even with a generation who have found him on their television and not the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bob Hope is hilarious in this western comedy!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jane Russell plays Calamity Jane who is offered pardon on a ten year sentence if she tracks down the culprits who are selling weapons to the Indians. She hitches up with a dim-witted dentist, Bob Hope, so that she can trick the bad guys into thinking that he is the federal agent tracking them down, instead of her. Hope is conned into thinking that he has killed a dozen or so Indians, in one of the funnier scenes. Hope is extremely funny in this comedy western as he struts his stuff through the old west. Most jokes hit their mark, and Russell is as much fun as Calamity Jane as well. The catchy Oscar winning tune "Buttons and Bows" is given a voice by Hope early in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>quite excellent in a fluffy sort of way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The chemistry between Jane Russel and Bob Hope is one of the many reasons that this film shines. There are several genuinely hilarious scenes - the Indian on laughing gas, Bob's big gunfight, the cowboy having his rotten tooth pulled ...the list is endless.The only fault is that the films drags a little towards the final all action finale but other than that it's close to perfect. A great comedy and one of only a few truly great comic westerns. The currently available DVD is a great transfer but it comes on a vanilla disc. A documentary about Bob would have been welcome or even an introduction the way they have done with the John Wayne reisues would have added even greater value.As it stands a great little movie from the Golden Age of Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painless Peter Potter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bob Hope is in his element in this type of role, here he plays a dopey dentist named Painless Peter Potter, he is the kind of dentist that pulls the wrong teeth and gets high on his own laughing gas. Here he manages to get involved with Calamity Jane {a positively smouldering Jane Russell} and a caper set around rouge Cowboys selling guns and dynamite to the Indians. After mistakenly being taken for a hero after repelling an Indian attack and killing a number of them during said attack, we are taken on this delightful journey as Potter the coward transforms himself into a bravado gun slinger whilst not realising it's actually Calamity pulling his strings and shooting the pistols. It's a smashing comedy that perfectly showcases Hope's immeasurable talent for delivering one liners, in fact few comedians in history can deliver a quip better than Hope could. The chemistry between Russell and Hope is as sharp as the writing, and to cap it all off we get the delightful song Buttons &amp; Bows to hum along to, smashing uplifting comedy, 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, the title did not suggest anything to me when I first read it, but it made sense when I found out it was set in the Wild West, I was certainly hoping it would be worthy of a recommendation. Basically out west someone in town has been illegally selling guns to the Indians, frontiers woman Calamity Jane (Jane Russell) is hired to find the culprit, and she is to be partnered with a secret agent, they will go undercover and pose as husband and wife. When the secret agent is killed Jane is forced to recruit a new husband, and she finds innocent, inept and cowardly dentist 'Painless' Peter Potter (Bob Hope), he wants to the leave the barbaric west all together. On their investigative journey their wagon train is attacked by Indians, and while Jane is sharpshooting from inside an empty shack witnesses spot Potter presumably firing and defeating them, when in fact he is useless with a weapon. Upon return the townspeople praise Potter as a hero, and this means he will be a target for both the Indians and the gunrunners, but as time passes he may in fact be learning bravery and to defend himself better, and of course he and Jane cannot help having affection for each other. Also starring Robert Armstrong as Terris, Iris Adrian as Pepper, Bobby Watson as Toby Preston, Jackie Searl as Jasper Martin, Joseph Vitale as Indian Scout, Charles Trowbridge as Governor Johnson, Clem Bevans as Hank Billings and Jeff York as Big Joe. The most memorable Calamity Jane for me will always be Doris Day, however Russell, a short time after The Outlaw, proves a great choice for this film as she looks beautiful and is brassy when she needs to be, I have not seen much of Bob Hope as a stand up comedian (perhaps because I know all his material was written for him by others), and he too is a good choice being the wisecracking and for a good while lily-livered dupe. I have read various reviews by critics saying that the sequel, Son of Paleface, is much better than this is, as for this original I found it funny enough, it had a good amount of good old fashioned slapstick, this was apparently a big box office hit, and it is entertaining for its action as well, so it's not a bad comedy western. It won the Oscar for Best Song for "Buttons and Bows". Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nice western spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I confess a weakness for the Bob Hope of the '40s - cute, funny, and guileless. His cowardly persona played well in many films."The Paleface" is the story of Calamity Jane (Jane Russell) being broken out of jail and offered a full pardon by the government if she can track down who is running guns to the Indians. Unfortunately, the man who is to accompany her on the wagon train to investigate is murdered. While running from people out to get her, she ends up in the office of Painless Peter Potter, a dentist who has to use a manual when he's working on a patient. He has his own wagon; Jane recruits him to marry her and join the wagon train.Hope and Russell are great together. She's gorgeous in color wearing a variety of costumes. Hope is very funny, and he gets to introduce the song "Buttons 'n' Bows." One of the best scenes is Painless Peter trying to pull a tooth; another is an Indian who inadvertently inhales Peter's laughing gas.Not exactly politically correct by today's standards, but it's still fun and wonderful to see these classic film stars, whose number is dwindling with alarming speed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Similar to Shakiest Gun in the West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing I noticed about this movie is that the plot is similar to that of The Shakiest Gun in the West, starring Don Knotts, which was made 20 years later. This worried me a little at first, because although I love The Shakiest Gun in the West, I didn't want to watch a movie that was almost exactly the same except that it starred a different person. However, I didn't let this stop me from watching the entire movie, and I was pleasantly surprised. Enough of the story was different that it didn't get boring, and of course Bob Hope lended his own acting style and sense of humor, so I ended up really enjoying it. In fact, in some ways I liked this movie better than The Shakiest Gun in the West. If you like Bob Hope movies, you'll probably enjoy this one. I know I sure did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>481st Review: Simply one of the best comedies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If comedy is about making us laugh then The Paleface is comedy at its finest; it's goofy, spoofy, and just superb. Bob Hope hams it up, Jan Russell burns the screen with her dark looks and all in all this really is one of the funnier films ever made.The plot of the dentist who gets mixed up with the wild west gunshooting girl is just an excuse to hand line after line of comedy. Every grimace, every double take is perfection, but more than that, it's not trying to be smart, it just aims to make you forget the world and lose yourself on the silver screen for a while.Every time I watch The Paleface, and I must seen it more than ten times now, it just always, but always, makes me laugh, and it always makes me wish that Bob Hope was still with us. It's vaudeville and farce, but it's also the kind of comedy that is absolutely timeless - I guarantee we'll be watching this one into the next century and beyond!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Bob Hope's best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all of Bob Hope's films, this is among his best. In fact, the film was so well received when it debuted that the song "Buttons and Bows" went on to be a bit and a sequel came out four years later. In the sequel, of sorts, Jane Russell and Bob Hope return--but as different people (Hope plays the son of the man from this film). Why is this film so good? Well, part of it is that the music (which they seemed to always shove into 1940s comedies) isn't bad, the script quite good and the characters quite enjoyable.The film begins with Calamity Jane (Jane Russell) being broken out of jail. However, this is no ordinary prison break--it was organized by the government because they wanted Jane to do some undercover work. But, they staged it so that her partners in crime wouldn't suspect she'd made a deal to help out in exchange for a pardon.Soon after agreeing, she meets up with Bob Hope--who is a rather addled dentist. She pretends to fall in love with him and marries him to create a cover for herself--not because she has any interest in being married. And, considering that Hope is annoying and a wimp, you'd think he's realize he's being used. But, he's pretty dumb and has no idea his wife is a special agent or that they aren't making love. Every time she kisses him, she whomps him over the head--and he thinks she's so hot that is why he passes out! Eventually, the trail of the baddies leads to an Indian camp and Hope's prowess as an Indian fighter will lead to his dying a horrible death. That's because Jane has, on the sly, done all the trick shooting that everyone thinks Hope has been doing--and taking credit for throughout the film! Will they get out of it alive? Will love bloom for real? Will Bing Crosby make a cameo? Tune in to see.Overall, while the film ain't exactly subtle, it's pleasant fun from start to finish. Nothing brilliant here, but it is quite good and the sequel is also quite nice as well--plus it co-stars Roy Rogers in addition to Hope and Russell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good vehicle for Bob's talents. A few of the posts here do not like this movie and do not find it funny but I think they must have a strange sense of humour. This was original in that it parodied a very popular genre of its time, the western. It seems that almost every other film was a western in the fifties and this was a breath of fresh air, debunking the myth. However the sequel, Son of Paleface, was sharper and funnier, building on the success of this one. While not the best actress in the world Jane Russell was always sexier and more talented than Monroe in her movies. Incidentally, there should be a movement for Kelsey Grammar to portray Hope in a biopic before he is much too old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Paleface is not as funny as it first seemed back in 1948, when a spoof western was more of a novelty. Nevertheless, there are still some very amusing situations and many of Bob Hope's wisecracks and comebacks are just as snappy and laugh-getting now as they were back in '48. Good old Norman Z. McLeod's direction even occasionally evinces a bit of style such as the wedding ceremony observed entirely with close-ups of the players' hands, and most notably in the whole episode of the shoot-out, starting with its really inventive pan in the saloon with all the characters lined up at the bar! Jane Russell ? in only her third film ? registers agreeably both as a filler for curvy period costumes and as a straight man for Bob Hope's foolery. Bobby Watson heads a great support cast featuring some of our favorite cameo actors including Olin Howlin as a grinning undertaker, Nestor Paiva as a tough guy patient and George Chandler as a meek one. Is that Glenn Strange who changes clothes with our hero? No, I guess not. The film's only drawback lies in the non-humorous sequences in which the plot is laboriously explained. These are directed in a totally lackluster style. Fortunately, whenever Hope is on-screen, the movie ticks along nicely. He even gets a chance to sing an agreeable little ditty called "Buttons and Bows" which went on to win Hollywood's most prestigious award for Best Song. Ray Rennahan's color photography is also first-rate. In fact, production values generally leave nothing to be desired. Available on an excellent Universal DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No matter if I've now seen this Western comedy umpteen times boy and man it still makes me laugh. There isn't much subtlety and there's plenty of farce but it's still an entertaining story with many sparkling quips to be had from Bob Hope in classic form.Jane Russell as Calamity Jane is sprung from jail by government undercover men, in the hope she will help them track down some white baddies running arms to the Injuns, and in return for a full pardon. On the way she enrols the unwitting Hope playing a not-so-painless dentist. One memorable scene follows another, not a minute is wasted in the ninety ? even the slapstick sections (such as Hope stopping to growl a bit too much) are brief. And the cute song Buttons And Bows won the Oscar so maybe should be sat through respectfully. Favourite bits: Nestor Paiva laughing at the pain he was in after the wrong tooth was extracted by a laughing Hope with both under the influence of laughing gas; Hope apparently giving the marriage JP a kiss; the trouble had taking the reins; Hope not fooling with Joe's gal ? and the offhand reprimand he later gave Joe's corpse; the lean to the right sequence (Danny Kaye's later take on it in The Court Jester was better though); the happy film having a happy ending; so many others. The production values were high, the Technicolor warm, the direction tight, and thankfully the humour was decidedly middlebrow.One of my favourite Bob Hope films it was meant for ordinary people to enjoy thoughtlessly, a concept that is always derided by clever people. Thanks to its immense antiquity this maybe had an abundance of stereotypes of all types but it had a good heart and humour, something missing in the later Western comedy Blazing Saddles. I wonder idly how many untrained moviegoers in 1948 would've laughed if Hope and the other cowboy characters in here had sat around at length swearing and bursting their fluffboxes?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paleface- Jane Makes Bob Shoot Straight ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A typical Bob Hope comedy made more interesting by the presence of the recently deceased Jane Russell.Hope had the honor of singing Buttons and Bows, and the song went on to win the Oscar in 1948.The premise of the movie is quite humorous. To get pardoned for her transgressions, Russell must find out who is smuggling guns to the Indians. When the agent assigned to be her husband is killed, she finds unlikely candidate Hope as an eastern-correspondent school dentist and quickly marries him.Whoever made the costumes for Russell deserved some kind of award. In many scenes, she was made to look frumpy, far out of her usual realm.The picture goes down in quality once she and Hope are captured by the Indians. Some real good straight shooting by Russell makes Hope look like the town hero. This is always good for a laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hope Romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie, as I recall, was a smash hit, along with the catchy "Buttons and Bows" musical number. It's also one of Hope's best roles. He's Painless Potter, dentist extraordinaire; just don't let him anywhere near your teeth, or anything else, for that matter. As bumbler-in-chief of about everything, Painless muffs one funny challenge after another, as fashioned (in part) by the imaginative Frank Tashlin. There's also a couple of Bob's gag writers credited, so the one-liners fly as fast as Tashlin's sight gags (for example, the occasional comic strip blurbs cartoonist Tashlin was noted for). At the same time, the complicated plot is just a handy rack for Hope to hang his polished shtick on. And catch that final gag with Bob's breaking character with an aside to the audience that just about sums things up.But instead of Crosby to pair up with, Bob has the luscious Jane Russell, and while she may not be as funny as Bing, I love it when Painless mistakes an Indian for her on their wedding night. (Note how the screenplay marries them early on, thereby avoiding censorship problems. Note too how her buxom measurements are downplayed, likely a concession to the expected family audiences.)I don't know if there's a downside since it's a funnyman romp all the way. Maybe, for me, a downside is finding out from IMDb that Iron Eyes Cody, such a great Indian, is not an Indian at all, but was instead born in Italy. Oh well, it's all Hollywood make-believe anyway, so who cares since it's a darn amusing movie, Italian Indians or no.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hope Goes West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the old American West, faint-hearted dentist Bob Hope (as "Painless" Peter Potter) plays horsey with statuesque sharpshooter Jane Russell (as Calamity Jane). Mr. Hope masquerades as a fearless Indian fighter wedded to Ms. Russell as a government agent. Possibly the film's comedy highlight ends when Hope nearly kisses a Native American chief on laughing gas. At least, it's the film's least lifeless scene. In a surprisingly inept dub, thanks to the star's own laughable instrumental accompaniment, Hope sings Livingston and Evans' classic "Buttons and Bows" which became a huge million-selling #1 hit for Dinah Shore. At the time, audiences were ripe for Technicolor and a western spoof. In the 1940s, they seemed to always be in the mood for Hope, and "The Paleface" helped make him "Quigley Publications" #1 box office star for 1949.**** The Paleface (12/24/48) Norman Z.

		<shortDescription>A Pretty Good Showcase For Bob Hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This works pretty well as a showcase for Bob Hope's comedic and other talents. While it's hardly anything to take seriously, it allows the ever-likable Hope to be himself and to make use of the opportunities for one-liners, sight gags, and a song or two, including his "Buttons and Bows". The story is exaggerated enough to render moot most questions of believability or character motivation.Hope is in good form, delivering his lines well and in a style that keeps things light-hearted while not pushing it too far. His role as 'Painless' Potter suits him well, and he is able to carry much of the movie by himself. That is fortunate, since most of the rest of the movie is rather slight. Jane Russell starts off well enough, but it's not long before she has little new to offer, and her character is left with some unfulfilled potential. The other characters are mostly one-dimensional to begin with.Then again, this kind of feature is not really meant to be analyzed. It gives Hope a chance to deliver his easygoing style of comedy, and should just be taken as such. It also worked well enough to provide the basis for a pretty good sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Pales' In Comparison To Some Of Hope's Other Comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't think this was anywhere as great as some reviewers (not here on the IMDb) led me to believe, saying this was "Bob Hope's best movie," "funniest film ever," etc. I found that FAR from the truth, although humor is very subjective. I can think of two of Hope's comedies, just off the top of my head, that were much funnier: The Ghost Breakers and Sorrowful Jones.Anyway, the first half of this film was the worst, just stupid and very few laughs. The second half is much better, after Hope begins to think he's a gunfighter. The second half has some good humor, and helps save the film. This was my first look at Jane Russell. I thought she acted woodenly and wasn't all that pretty. Like this movie, Russell's reputation, looks-wise, is better than the reality. Her chest is what made her. She would have fit better in today's films where hard-looking, tough-talking women are featured.One last thing on the positive side: there is nice, bright color in here, good to see in any 1940s film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low-Key And Amusing, With Decent If Not Overwhelming Stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been a little bit underwhelmed by Bob Hope. I grew up in a home that watched all of his TV specials with family who thought he was the greatest and funniest comedian ever. I never quite got it. I find him low-key in the extreme; sometimes amusing in a mild, quiet sort of way but nothing to write home about. That also sums up my reaction to "The Paleface." It's OK. Sometimes amusing, and if it's mild and quiet it has some good writing - I'm thinking of Painless Peter Potter (Hope) trying to keep all the advice he had received about his gunfight with the local quick draw artist straight ("he leans to the right so shoot to the left," and so on) as well as the fun song "Buttons and Bows" (sung by Hope.)Potter is a hopeless dentist trying to make his way in the Old West when he gets caught up with Calamity Jane (Jane Russell) - who's been recruited to work as a government agent trying to find out who's getting guns to the Indians. She hooks up with Potter, tricks him into marriage and manages to turn him into the gunfighting hero so that no one would notice her. Russell was fine in the role, but like Hope she didn't overwhelm me.I would say that this was better than the 1960's movie "The Shakiest Gun In The West," which had essentially the same sort of plot with Don Knotts in the role as the dentist. Hope played the role straighter than Knotts would do 20 years later, and that perhaps made it a little easier to take the movie seriously - as comedies go, of course. (5/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great fun early parody, starring Bob Hope.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is really one great fun comedy, that can be seen as an early parody of the western genre.Parodies actually weren't quite common yet in the '40's. Besides, westerns themselves also weren't that popular anymore at the time, so this movie seemed a bit like an unlikely one and a bit of a gamble that paid off very well in the end.It's a real fun movie to watch, thanks to its humor. As a comedy this movie is just great and does definitely has some funny moments in it. Not just physically but also it's writing and acting from Bob Hope is what's making this movie often so fun to watch.I must say that Bob Hope was really one great comedy actor, who know how to handle its slapstick as well as its dialogs. A real actor who just seemed to be made for the genre. He adds quite a lot to this movie and often makes scenes that otherwise wouldn't had been very funny hilarious to watch. Too bad that Jane Russell impresses less. She just wasn't being a very great actress in this movie and it doesn't seem like a big wonder that her career never got off the ground and mostly played her film roles in the '40's and '50's only. There also is absolutely no chemistry between her and the Bob Hope character, not even in the sequences when there really is supposed to be. She must hate the character for most part of the movie though luckily, which still makes her performance a bit bearable for some parts of the movie. Oh well, at least the movie knew who to put it's main focus on though; Bob Hope.It was kind of weird though seeing Bob Hope blast away all those Indians with his guns, just for the comic effect of it all. I don't know, it just didn't felt right. The whole thing just had a bit of a racist thing over it.It was a good choice this shoot this picture in full color. It makes the movie a bright one to watch obviously, which adds to the fun feeling of the overall movie. It also makes the movie perhaps a bit fake and campy looking but again, this also adds to the overall feeling of the movie and seems suiting for an early genre movie such as this one.Still they could had spend some more time on its story. Now the story is mostly being dull and hard to follow, simply because it's such an uninteresting one. They tried to put in perhaps a too serious main plot-line, which is in huge contrast with the movie its comedy and the reason why the story just never becomes compelling. The movie is best to watch while switching your brain off and when you're just not wondering too much what the movie is all about, who all these characters are and what their motivations all are. No, just sit back and enjoy this movie please!A surprisingly great and funny western parody from the late '40's!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedious fluff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple of laughs punctuate this slapdash and brainlessly silly (even for Bob Hope standards) comedy oater. Very standard fare, though it looks great on DVD.Was there ever a more lifeless starlet in the forties than Jane Russell? She always looks like a prostitute in the sack checking her watch every five seconds. She does absolutely nothing in this picture but look bored and full of contempt. And Hope tries and tries to be funny but mostly just falls flat. One exception is the lead-up to the gunfight when he mixes up the instructions on how to approach the killer while trying to keep them straight in his head. This routine was stolen and re-tooled to better effect a few years later for Danny Kaye in The Court Jester.The bit with the cat made me laugh too, and Hope singing 'Buttons and Bows' is notable, but other than that I'd only recommend this film if you have insomnia</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly high death toll for a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martha Jane Canary-Burke and Ernestine Jane Russell not only had the same middle name but also preferred to be known by it. It was therefore perhaps appropriate that one of them should have played the other in this comedy Western. Ms Canary-Burke was also portrayed in (among other films) "Calamity Jane" where she was played by Doris Day, but Ms Russell's interpretation is very different. Although the script of "Calamity Jane" tells us that the heroine is a tough frontierswoman she is played by the ultra-feminine Day (in a deliberate piece of miscasting for comic effect) as a sweet young thing who looks far more at home in a pretty dress than in her buckskins. Here she is certainly physically attractive (what character played by the fair Ernestine could ever be anything else?), but also rough and hard-bitten. The film opens with Calamity in jail, charged with some unspecified offence. She is offered her freedom if she can perform a task for the government, namely to discover who's been illegally selling guns to Indians. In this task she has the assistance of Peter "Painless" Potter who has been trying to earn a living out west as a dentist, despite an almost total lack of aptitude for that profession. (His self-awarded nickname is far from appropriate). Painless's professional incompetence is only equalled by his cowardice and general ineptitude, so he is perhaps not the most suitable companion for Jane in her mission. Nevertheless, Painless acquires the reputation of a crack shot and brave hero because Jane (who needs to keep her identity a secret) allows him to take the credit for her own deeds. For reasons too complex to go into here, Jane and Painless end up married to one another and (in the best romantic comedy tradition) they of course fall in love.As with most comedy Westerns, this one relies for a lot of its humour on its ability to send up classic Western situations. That duel between Painless and a local ruffian is a comic version of every Western in which a fearless lawman cleans up a lawless town, such as "Dodge City" and "My Darling Clementine" which had come out two years earlier. I am not particularly familiar with Bob Hope's work in the cinema, having previously seen only a handful of his films, but he was clearly a talented comic actor, and his sense of timing and his facial expressions both contribute a lot to the humour, making lines or scenes seem funny even when they would not seem very amusing on the printed page. He also receives good support from the lovely Jane Russell in only her third film. The film was made in Technicolor, but unlike many colour Westerns from this period and the following decade (such as, for example, "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon") it was not filmed on location but in a studio. As a comedy it has stood the test of time fairly well, except in one important respect. For a humorous film there is a surprisingly high death toll as Calamity ruthlessly guns down her enemies, with Painless taking the credit. With a few exceptions such as the aforementioned ruffian, most of the dead are Native Americans or, as they would have been referred to in 1948, Indians, who are mocked as comically savage villains, (and who can therefore safely be shot dead even in a comedy without anyone worrying). To say this is not anachronistic political correctness. By the late forties Hollywood's attitude towards Indians was starting to change, they were being portrayed with more respect and dignity (again "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" is a good example) and "Broken Arrow", that great pro-Indian Western, was only two years away. The way they are shown in this film is, to say the least, regrettable and the main reason I feel unable, despite some genuinely funny scenes, to give it a higher mark. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's never a good thing when I have to struggle to come up with a film review. I'm a pretty big fan of Bob Hope but this one left me a bit flat, perhaps because I watched it out of sequence with the follow up film "Son of Paleface" with Hope and Russell on hand once more, but as different characters. The sequel also featured my favorite movie cowboy Roy Rogers, along with Trigger giving a career performance that might have upstaged the nominal stars of the picture.The team up of Hope and Russell seems like a natural but it wouldn't have hurt for Mariska Hargitay's mom to crack a smile every now and then. There's no pretense at all that this is a parody Western, so why not lighten up and have a little fun with it? Russell seemed to be taking this a lot more seriously than she needed to, and if I noticed it I think the director should have too.Perhaps the biggest plus here is the film's vibrant Technicolor format, especially when it showcases the Indians in their brightly colored tribal gear. Hope's no slouch either in his gaudy Western outfit, which only goes to emphasize how out of place he is in the Old West scheme of things. Once again though, I'm of a mind that Russell's reputation is greater than the reality, and her full figured look isn't as exceptional as one might be led to believe. Nothing she wore in this picture managed to flatter, so if that's what you're expecting, you'll have to catch her in the sequel doing that sexy singing number at the Dirty Shame Saloon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Hope vehicle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never as funny as it might have been, THE PALEFACE is a Bob Hope vehicle that has the old ski-nose playing "Painless" Potter, a bumbling dentist out West who gets tangled up with Cal;amity Jane (Russell) and a bunch of gun runners. Jane is a government agent sent to stop the bad guys, and she marries Painless so she can pose as a clueless married woman. Along the way, she makes her new husband appear to be a fearless gunfighter. The film is long and just not all that funny. Obviously, writer Frank Tashlin agreed, as he made his own sequel several years later that is a real hoot. In SON OF PALEFACE, Painless' grown son teams up with Roy Rogers and Trigger to fight the bad guys. Nothing against Jane Russell, but in the case of these two movies, I'll take Trigger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pale acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tycoon/studio head who discovered Jane Russell had to be a nut. Although a big size, she's not glamorous, doesn't have any sex appeal, nor can she act, or even react to Bob Hope's line. There's only one facial expression of hers throughout the picture, which is impatient with whatever Bob does. It's amazing that they brought her back to do SON OF PALEFACE with Bob again.THE PALEFACE is simply too childish to be funny, so is every film touched by Frank Tashlin, one of the writers of this movie and later became the director of its sequel. It's hard to imagine anyone over ten-years-old would enjoy his tired kiddie gags.Norman McLeod is one of the many comedy directors who relies heavily on competent writers and fine actors, otherwise he couldn't invent any joke by himself. It's understandable that most of the better Bob Hope movies are those ROAD pictures he made with Bing Crosby, where the directors would just sit back and let them improvise their scenes on the set.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not exactly David Milch material but OK for a few chuckles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bob Hope has a way with murder and mayhem. It just goes down extremely easy with the guy. Jane Russell is eye candy but is a one note actress if I've ever seen one. The villains are bowling pins to be knocked down and the movie doesn't have a racial tolerant bone in its body. Frank Tashlin understood how to stage his films with the most extreme cartoon-like aspects. Very broad but without depth. The final punch line, however, revealed a dark humor that was played out on the edges of the story. Whenever I look at a western these days I immediately try to imagine what David Milch could have done with it."What were you expecting? A happy ending?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hope is a dentist who gets a false reputation has a great gunfighter, thanks to Russell, as Calamity Jane, using him as a decoy. This lame parody of Westerns is good for about two or three mild chuckles. Hope tries but the script is stupid and humorless and the direction is uninspired. Russell has a somewhat annoyed expression on her face throughout the film. It does get better as it goes along but that's not saying much. The best bits are the gunfight between Hope and the guy that he tells to get out of town before sundown and the scene where Hope is tied to two trees by the Indians so that he'll rip apart. The attempts at humor are forced and just not funny.</fullReview>
