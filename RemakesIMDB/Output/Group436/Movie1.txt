		<shortDescription>kids will love it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most surprising films I have recently seen. I first saw it as a kid and liked it. However, I saw it again recently after one of my students brought it in and asked if his 8th grade history class could watch it. Well, I figured the movie had nothing to do with the class so I made some excuses not to use it. Later in the year, we had a day just before the break and once again he asked if the class could watch it. Well, we were about to do a small unit on the real West, so I reluctantly agreed. The film turned out to be pretty helpful in discussing Hollywood myths about the old West (as it had a few like most Westerns) but I was also VERY surprised to see how much 8th graders today liked the film. This actually says something, because normally these kids would never watch an "ancient" film like this--choosing instead to watch only the latest releases. But the film held their attention and I heard a lot of laughs. It's actually better than I remembered and is far better than a lot of Don Knotts' other films (such as THE INCREDIBLE MR. LIMPET or THE APPLE DUMPLING GANG--yuck).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very, very funny, vintage Don Knotts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie. It is hilarious. Don Knotts proves once again why he was so beloved by audiences, especially children. His winning, comedic character is so sweetly vulnerable. He is a great example to today's comedians, who rely on vulgarities and smart-Alec comments to "entertain" audiences. There are many wonderful supporting players on hand, such as Carl Ballantine, Pat Morita and Donald "Red" Barry. And of course the lovely Barbara Rhoades. Seeing this film as a little boy in the theatre, I thought there was no lovelier creature on the planet-- especially in that green velvet dress!I hope this commentary is more helpful than the inane, pseudo-intellectual ramblings of the previous comment, which, if it was not made in jest, should have been-- there is no other excuse for it. At least we both agree-- this is a terrific film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don Knotts star in this wacky comedy/western.Knotts plays a Philadelphia Dentist who head west to bring oral hygiene.he gets more than he bargained for,in the process.Dr. Jesse Heywood's penchant for being timid nervous,and bumbling provide some pretty funny moments.Knotts is pretty funny here,but i really Barbara Rhoades as Penny.i loved her spunky,and her take no guff attitude.she is the perfect foil for Knott's Zaniness.while this movie won't change your life,it should make you laugh.even if it wasn't funny,i think it would still work as just a western.for me,The Shakiest Gun in the West is a 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barney Fife Goes West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story by Edmund Hartman and Frank Tashlin has certainly got an endearing quality because two comics managed to get hit movies from it. The Shakiest Gun In The West is a reworking of the Bob Hope-Jane Russell classic, The Paleface. Into Hope's shoes steps Don Knotts trembling all the way to the bank.Knotts takes his Barney Fife character and has him graduate Philadelphia Dental College and decide to take Horace Greeley's advice and go west to seek fame and fortune. Like Hope he gets himself tangled up with a lady bandit played by the curvaceous Barbara Rhoades. Barbara might not have the development of Jane Russell, but there are few who do. Anyway she's been promised a pardon if she'll find out who's selling guns and whiskey to the Indians.And to get west she needs a schnook and when Bob Hope's not around, Don Knotts will certainly do. But Knotts certainly has an endearing quality to him as she finds out.Some western veterans like Don Barry, Terry Wilson, Dub Taylor are all in this cast. This film was the farewell performance of Frank McGrath, best known as one of Hollywood's premier stunt men who turned actor and played Charlie Wooster on Wagon Train. Jackie Coogan is in this one too, playing a church deacon.Some of the gags from The Paleface are repeated here and some might say get better with age.Definitely a film for Barney Fife fans the world over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your Standard, Fun Don Knotts Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jesse W. Haywood (Don Knotts) graduates from dental school in Philadelphia in 1870 and goes west "to fight oral ignorance." Meanwhile stagecoach robber Penelope "Bad Penny" Cushing (Barbara Rhoades) is offered a pardon if she will track down a ring of gun smugglers.Don Knotts fans will enjoy this one, as it fits right in line with his regular comedy style (more like "Andy Griffith" or "Frame a Figg" and less like "Private Eyes"). There is plenty of physical comedy, especially early on, and if you like a bit of slapstick, this is for you.By today's standards, the film may be considered questionable because of its portrayal of Native Americans. I am not one to be politically correct, but did find the scenes with them to be rather dated. Not offensive, but not really positive either. But I will not dwell on this.Definitely one of Knotts' better films, and a good deal funnier than "Mr. Limpet".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Wagon Train" meets "Paleface," and more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when "The Shakiest Gun In The West" was released, and as a kid, I took Don Knotts for granted, because he was on every day on reruns of "The Andy Griffith Show." I'll admit that I was not a fan of his.That said, this was an enjoyable outing. While I understand this was a remake of a Bob Hope Western comedy, what stuck out for me was how this played, in part, like a late-1960s episode of "Wagon Train," especially with Terry Wilson and Frank McGrath present. In fact, this was the final appearance of Mr. McGrath, who died 18 months or so before the film's release. Mr. McGrath's passing was a real loss, as he added something very special.And then there was Barbara Rhoades! I first saw her in "Harry and Tonto" (1974), and her presence adds something special. As for Don Knotts, I do understand his presence and his appeal for many. While it is not so easy for me to connect, I will put the blame on myself for that one, because Mr. Knotts is good at what he did! Anyway, it is well worth a watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don Knotts meets Bob Hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you happen to own or rent the Don Knotts "Reluctant Hero" pack, this is one of the four films, and probably the least strong in terms of comedy. It is a remake of the movie Paleface, with Bob Hope and Jane Russell, not exactly shot for shot, but close. A lot of the same jokes were used, and the plot is identical.However, I still recommend this film. It's got some very funny stuff. While I'm not usually a fan of remakes, I thought this WAS better than Paleface, though it could just be I saw this one so many times first. Son of Paleface I had seen before Paleface, and I enjoy that one quite a lot.Apart from the comedy in this film, we get Barbara Rhoades, the love interest. Let me just say, VA VA VOOM! YOWZA! and COR, BLIMEY! You'll have to see for yourself though....This fits nicely into Knotts' "reluctant hero" idea, and I recommend it overall. It's a fun film.P.S. "How's it going, Heywood?"</fullReview>

The boy,being society.I think it was followed in spirit by other films further down the line.Funny Farm,and it's own references to a miss-adventures in an element that is not ones own. I give it four and a half stars on a scale of five.Two thumbs up,fine holiday fun.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked it...what can I say?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know it's a remake of Paleface, which I also enjoyed, but I liked "Shakiest.." better. It was...dare I say it?...cute. Don Knotts' patented nervous Nelly riff was great. Nobody does it better than he did. Barbara Rhodes was beautiful, sexy, and fiery, much more so than Jane Russell. This is no slam against Ms. Russell. Ms. Russell had a smoldering sensuality few actresses even today could match. And I loved the subtle gender role reversal at the end. Few actors other than Don Knotts could have pulled it off without seeming weird or gay. Not that there is anything wrong with being gay, mind you! I am just saying is all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Similar to " Son of Paleface and Paleface " but not as good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don Knotts was true to form as a meek and weak man with a little gumption; his historical stereotype. Yes, this movie is a weaker version of a combined " Paleface and Son of Paleface " from earlier times. Barbara Rhodes is a very attractive woman with average acting skills. She is the best looking "cowboy" in her western duds. Her jeans look fabulous on her very shapely figure; she was poured into these pants like liquid wax into a mold. Barbara wears tall , tan ,suede cowboy boots with her jeans tucked inside with matching tan leather gun belt,; very sensual in her disguise as a male outlaw. Barbara, like Jane Russell in both Palefaces , becomes a reformed outlaw and marries the male star.By contrast, I have given " Son of Paleface " a value of 10 out of 10 for its effort in previous reviews. Jane Russell as a " cowboy outlaw "doesn't wear jeans but fancy stretch ski pants as her riding attire, over all Jane Russell is more sensual than Barbara.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an enjoyable spoof of the western by the great actor Don Knotts. Knotts is in top form as a mild mannered man out of his element in the old west and plays Dr. Heywood with one of the greatest physical comedy performances I've seen. He is able to faint at one moment and at another freeze in place like a statue (that was one of my favorite gags)and let's not forget his hilarious bug eyed expressions.The movie also features the pretty red haired Barbara Rhoades as Knott's love interest/protector who adds a twist on the heroic exploits of the western hero. Overall this is a light hearted romp which left me laughing on numerous occasions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don Knotts stars as recent dental school graduate Jesse W. Heywood, who goes west from Philadelphia to make his name and fortune, but instead gets mixed up with stagecoach robber Penelope 'Bad Penny' Cushings(played by Barbara Rhoades), who is captured by authorities but offered a pardon if she will help them stop gun smugglers, which requires her to assume a new identity and husband - enter Jessie, who is all-too thrilled by her "romantic" interest in him, and helps him build a reputation as a gunfighter by doing his shooting for him... another silly comedy with Don Knotts doing his best with inferior material. Some occasional funny bits, and Rhoades is appealing, but film goes nowhere and leads to unfunny ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shakiest Gun In The West (Alan Rafkin, 1968) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second Don Knotts star vehicle that I've watched is perhaps more readily enjoyable than the first - THE GHOST AND MR. CHICKEN (1966) ? but the fact that it was an unnecessary remake of the classic Bob Hope comedy THE PALEFACE (1948) hurts the overall effort. In fact, Knotts takes the role of a dentist out West who comes up (at least, initially) against an attractive sharp-shooting female robber (Barbara Rhoades) - played in the original by Jane Russell; when the latter is pardoned by the U.S. government and enrolled as their agent in hot pursuit of Indian gun-runners (one of whom is played by Jackie "Uncle Fester" Coogan), she is forced to hastily take the understandably awed Knotts for a husband as a cover (following the killing of her original intended).The amusing opening sequences depict Knotts' misadventures in dentistry ? highlighted by his energetic encounter with a generously-built female patient who beats him up repeatedly within an inch of his life - but he is soon on his way westward because his hometown is already overrun with dentists. His wagon train is attacked by marauding Indians before long and, consequently, he earns himself a reputation as a fast gun (even though, in reality, it was Rhoades who mowed down ten Indians). After their marriage, Knotts is naturally more of a hindrance than a help to Rhoades in fulfilling her mission - even going so far as to bring about her abduction by the two villainous gun-runners to a nearby Indian camp when he follows her to a midnight rendezvous in a chapel.However, he proves his real mettle to his wife when, dressed up as a squaw(!), he infiltrates the Redskins' camp at night and frees Rhoades - but not before stirring up trouble (of the romantic jealousy type) between two Indians who, incongruously enough, had found Knotts' sinewy figure attractive in their eyes! At the end, yet another Indian wants to exert his lawful rights on the squaw-attired Knotts but he has to contend with the now-gushing Rhoades and her gunmanship. A harmless, moderately entertaining Western comedy, therefore, but nowhere near the shining examples of the genre (which, incidentally, include THE PALEFACE itself).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don Knotts. Enough said.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not as well made as the original Bob Hope film "The Paleface" (this remake pretty much uses the same script but loses the song "Buttons and Bows"), but better than it's sequel "Son of Paleface." Don Knotts plays his usual nervous character without the Bob Hope pathos making for a sitcom style comedy (think "F-Troop"). Don Knotts would do several other comedy westerns in a few years including "The Apple Dumpling Gang."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>60's Style Comedy On The Big Screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's nothing wrong with the premise of this movie. In fact, the premise is really quite amusing. Jesse Heywood (played by Don Knotts) is a newly graduated bumbling dentist who moves out to the Old West to practice and bumbles his way into being mistaken for a big-time gunfighter. It's quite silly in a fun kind of way. It doesn't have very many uproarious laughs but it keeps you smiling. To me, though, it doesn't have enough substance to be a big screen movie. Don Knotts played the part of Heywood well - he played it basically as Don Knotts would play any part. I like Don Knotts, but really - he's a second banana type who's made for TV. As second banana to Andy Griffith in "The Andy Griffith Show" or to John Ritter in "Three's Company" he added a lot with his own unique comedic style. As leading man in a Hollywood movie (even a silly one like this) he just doesn't have the presence to carry it.This is a bit slow to get started, and in all honesty Knotts struck me as a bit old to be just graduating as a dentist (although that might have been appropriate to the character - Heywood had spent his whole life in his mother's pocket, so to speak, and now was finally branching out on his own against her will.) Once Barbara Rhoades entered the scene as the beautiful stagecoach robber turned government agent it picks up steam a bit, although she also has little screen presence and has been consistently a supporting actress at best, mostly on TV. There's nothing especially wrong with this. I just found that it had trouble filling 100 minutes of screen time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don Knotts makes a Hopeless "Paleface"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1870 Philadelphia, faint-hearted Don Knotts (as Jesse W. Heywood) obtains a license in dentistry, and decides to spread "dental health through the west like a plague." After his stagecoach is held up, Mr. Knotts joins a wagon train. He plays horsey with buxom Barbara Rhoades (as Penelope Cushings) and dresses up as a fetching Indian squaw. Is Knotts' character bisexual? The ending leaves the question unanswered. Gun smugglers Jackie "Uncle Fester" Coogan and Don "Red Ryder" Barry head off an able supporting cast. Vic Mizzy's wild, wild western music resembles his own "Green Acres". All in all, this is a tedious, uncalled for re-make of Bob Hope's "The Paleface" (1948).** The Shakiest Gun in the West (7/10/68) Alan Rafkin ~ Don Knotts, Barbara Rhoades, Jackie Coogan</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paradigm Shattering!!!!!!!!!11</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to overlook the societal importance of "Shakiest". Most academics consider it a vapid re-make of a "superior" Bob Hope film. However my consensus is that Hope's movie simply Overemphasized the comedic aspects of the story and downplayed the sociological importance and mythical underpinnings of it. I don't fault Hope since his comedic talents are such that only his fully grasping of the genre and paradigm in its epistemological sense would allow him the proper frame/reference to "dim" his comedic talents enough to let the nuances of the story's deeper meanings emerge. Not so with Don Knotts. His performance is neo-subtle in the sense that he draws attention to the pre-Scorsesian templates of story entwined with yet separated from, meaning, by overexagerating Hope's performance to a Vonnegutian level. Example; his performance as Painless Jesse in the film's opening sequences underscore the relationship of Man the Creator with Man the Destroyer and Man the Dentist. In Barb Rhoades we see an equal but lesser voice representing tenets of Post-modern imperialism as well as Proto-Schwarzeneggerian grandiosity. Yet, it is Knotts, initially passive who redeems himself in the end, triumphing over Rhoades and all she symbolizes as well as echoing the pan-universal theme of the hero transformed by "plumbing" his own depths. This is shown particularly in the mine scene, where we read "mine" as "Subconscious Id". Simply put, not sense "The Incredible Mr. Limpett" has Knotts blended Transformational Mythology with Wellesian Cinematography and Jerrylewisian slapstick. BRAVO!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nervous dentist Don Knotts graduates from college in Philadelphia and goes west to start his practice. He inadvertently gets embroiled with a beautiful sharpshooter (Barbara Rhodes) and some bad guys (Jackie Coogan and Don "Red" Barry). The bad guys are wanting to sell weapons and liquor to Indians for their own monetary gain. Before we know it the wide-eyed Knotts falls in the middle of all the chaotic action with would-be funny results. Knotts was never the same after he left "The Andy Griffith Show". The reason is he had lots more help in that sitcom and he only had to sustain the audience's interest for a half hour at a time. This movie plays more like a television sitcom except for the fact that it is not as funny as it should be and it fails to make the characters believable or humanistic. Basically a cheap western live-action cartoon. 2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>
