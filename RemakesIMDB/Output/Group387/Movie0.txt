		<shortDescription>even sweeter with the years...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was younger &amp; first saw this movie, what caught my eye was the stage-y production, the over-ripe acting- I was wrong. It's funny, but being a late 30-something divorcee with my own self-esteem issues, I now watch this movie &amp; marvel at its depth. This is a movie about so much more than a con man, an old maid and people stuck and unable to change. It's really about loving yourself. We've all heard the saying that you have to love yourself before someone else can love you. And that is what this movie is about. Believing in yourself even when that's the hardest thing. It's really the crux of the movie.The casting is actually perfect. I cannot imagine anyone else as Starbuck. Burt Lancaster's magnetism and on-screen "je ne ce qua" and Hepburn's radiant simplicity are a match made in heaven. They compliment each other very well. The supporting cast is also well done. Holliman's exuberance is contagious and the sweetly supporting father and no nonsense brother Noah are well done but not over done. I highly recommend this movie. Give it a chance &amp; suspend your disbelief- that's part of what going to the movies is about. P.S. Several people mentioned the last scene with Lancaster riding into the rain as being over done, cheesy or whatever. Yet it's just that kind of imagery that does indeed stick with you after the movie. It may seem overblown the first time, yet upon subsequent viewings, I love the effusive and memorable affect it has on the viewer. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The skeptical reviewers miss the point. In fact, they take the position of Lizzie herself before she begins to believe in herself.That some of this movie appears hokey, over-the-top and unbelievable is perfect. It requires the same leap of faith for the movie viewer as the characters must take in the story.The script for this movie is brilliantly written and as timely today as it ever was. The casting and acting are wonderful.This movie makes a very valuable point: It's not a con when you help someone believe in herself. You do something wonderful when you help another find hope, faith and love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>big-hearted film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie always leaves me smiling. Sure, it's not a masterpiece of cinema, and one has to be willing to go with the staginess of it (it was, after all, a play originally), but there's such an exuberance to the performances and gentleness to the story that the movie wins you over. In fact maybe there is something appropriate about the obvious artifice of the sets, since the movie is about the roles that people play and the dreams that they cherish. Certainly Lancaster's charming con man is a master of the orotund and theatrical spiel. Another haunting Alex North score that occasionally recalls some of the poignant themes that he wrote for "A Streetcar Named Desire."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The drama of human emotion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>N. Richard Nash adapted his play for the silver screen. Directed by Joseph Anthony, this is a wonderful insight into the core of human emotion. A hard glimpse at the look of low self esteem.Katherine Hepburn plays Lizzie Curry, a young woman that lives with her father and brothers in a dusty prairie town. She is led to believe she will become an old maid. She of course has more brains than beauty and her emotions tell her that she needs to become a "woman".Enter Bill Starbuck, played aptly by Burt Lancaster; Starbuck is a con man constantly on the move bilking his way through life. He convinces the Curry family he can end the drought by making it rain. He ends up in the barn with Miss Lizzie. Now she feels a new world has opened up to her.Deputy File is too shy to tell Lizzie of his interest in her; until he finds Starbuck with her and wants to arrest him for his previous bad deeds. Lizzie has to make a big decision between the side of law and order or a life chasing dreams with a wanderer.This movie deserves to be called a classic. The deep human element and the diverse relationships within the characters makes for a very interesting movie. Scenery and language may seem at times a bit hokey; but the realism is there. Great movie.Besides Hepburn and Lancaster, this cast was full of good acting. Wendell Corey, Lloyd Bridges and Earl Holliman turned in fine jobs. Holliman's innocence and fresh spirit was a real highlight. The always cute Yvonne Lime also has a small part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When The Rainmaker came to Hollywood it was decided to get a couple of movie star names with some box office draw to replace the Broadway leads of Darren McGavin and Geraldine Page. The Rainmaker ran for 164 performances in the 1954-1955 season on Broadway and got good critical notices.Paramount wisely retained the services of playwright N. Richard Nash to do the screen version and he very nicely expanded the play which on Broadway was set in the Curry parlor to include all kinds of outdoor scenes. But the biggest thing they did was signing Burt Lancaster and Katharine Hepburn as the leads.Hepburn plays somewhat against type, though not apparently so. She manages to successfully hide her Bryn Mawr speech and does do well as a mid western spinster. The last time Kate went middle west it was for Alice Adams over 20 years before.But Lizzie Curry is no silly little girl like Alice was. She's an educated woman, a little too smart for most of the town folk where she lives. She intimidates them with her education. In fact she's being unfairly contrasted with Yvonne Lime who plays a silly flirt that her younger brother Earl Holliman is stuck on.Into her life comes Starbuck who says he can make it rain for $100.00 of Curry money that father Camerone Prudhomme forks over, much to older son Lloyd Bridges's objections. As Starbuck, Burt Lancaster is in dress rehearsal for his Oscar winning role as Elmer Gantry five years later. Lancaster gives Hepburn the great romance she's been seeking and needs in the same manner he wooed Sister Sharon Falconer in Elmer Gantry.My favorites in The Rainmaker are Hepburn's two brothers, Holliman and Bridges. Holliman in fact got a Golden Globe Award and young Earl more than held his own against this experienced group of veteran players. He's not terribly bright as he was in a whole lot of his early roles, but Earl has a good heart. Bridges is this control freak of a brother to whom the father has ceded much authority in the family and the running of their ranch. Cameron Prudhomme is the only one from the Broadway cast appearing in the film.Rounding out the cast are Wallace Ford and Wendell Corey as the sheriff and deputy who are both on Lancaster's trail and who the Currys try desperately to fix their sister up with. Corey has a few issues of his own to resolve however.Katharine Hepburn got one of her Best Actress Academy Award nominations for The Rainmaker, but she lost to Ingrid Bergman in Anastasia. The Rainmaker holds up very well for today's audience. After all, every family has some member they're trying to see happily wedded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another of Kate Hepburn's ageing spinsters, to set aside her travelling lady in Italy in 'Summer Madness'. This time she's the unmarried sister in a house of men, whose heart gets a kick start by a visiting 'rainmaker', in the shape of Burt Lancaster. Hepburn and Lancaster give charm and credence to what might have been an extremely ridiculous scenario. The whole is pretty stagey but it has heart which shines through. Good support from Lloyd Bridges, Wendell Corey and others. Funnily enough the part of the youngest brother was set for Elvis Presley's debut - wonder if he'd have been able to pull it off?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's called acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been made of the fact that nearly all of the actors were too old to comfortably inhabit their roles, which I think is crap. I don't think Hepburn's character felt anything other than genuine nor did it seem as if she were playing a character younger than her years. For one, she was a pretty well-preserved 49 - but that's almost beside the point. The point, I think being, is that no matter what your age or station, dreams will infuse you with beauty and purpose, so never abandon them. Sure, there were show-boaty moments (the final scene of the Rainmaker riding off springs to mind) - but this was made in 1956, after all, and gestures tended to be a little more expansive. Context, people, context.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's best, to live only in our dreams, only on the outside of them, or somewhere in between? N. Richard Nash has written a deceptively simple story about faith, reality, trust, and transformation in the script from his play, "The Rainmaker." Ably directed by Joseph Anthony, richly scored by Alex North, and lovingly played by Katherine Hepburn and Burt Lancaster, this is a poignant and surprisingly moving drama. While the secondary love interest between Earl Holliman and Yvonne Lime become a bit cloying and hokey at times, the main theme is beautifully enacted by two enormously gifted stars. "The Rainmaker" is an entertainment winner, while offering much substantive food-for-thought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> What can I say, it was a great movie. Katharine Hepburn is excellent as Lizzy Curry and Burt Lancaster in one of his best performances ever. Hepburndeserved her Oscar nomination but Lancaster should have been nominated aswell. You have to admit he was not playing his ordinary tough character. Hebrought some laughs to the movie as Starbuck. The supporting cast includingLloyd Bridges and Wendell Corey was great and Alex North's music is great asit usually is. This is an underrated movie and is definately worth your timewatching. You should see this movie if you haven't already. It's pretty hard to find of Video and it is not yet available on DVD and it should and if you do get this movie, don't get it confused with John Grisham's version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll say it like it is. This is a classic. Nash's play comes to live on the silver screen with veteran actors Cameron Prud'homme, Wallace Ford, Katie Hepburn and Earl Holliman. Wendell Corey, who few of us remember beyond his breaking a Ming Vase in Mildred Pierce, is great as the stiff deputy. Sweet little Yvonne Lime is on but for a few moments but the cast is great and the story comes together just wonderfully. The commenter who was bothered by Katie's New England English and the implausibility of the storyline needed to let go of such a rigid standard. Nothing is ever perfect. Lancaster is great as the fast-talking Starbuck and one can see flashes of his former role as the Italian buffoon in The Rose Tattoo and what will come in the later Elmer Gantry. This is a wonderful story and sensitively done by a fine cast. Check it out. It is a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Radiant Hepburn Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the screen adaptation of "The Rainmaker" remains firmly stage bound, once the film's fine cast involves viewers with the characters' complex emotions, the obviously fake sets are rarely noticed again. The painted skies, over-lit interiors, and western back-lots would under cut the film's veracity with a lesser cast. However, the leads are sterling, and, only a short time into the film, the small dreams of a lonely woman, who is just beyond her marrying years, engage the audience to such an extent that distractions from pedestrian direction, an often overly dramatic music score, and sound-stage exteriors will fade away.Katharine Hepburn gives arguably one of her finest performances as Lizzie, the plain spinster who harbors a repressed yearning for marriage and a family. Despite the ploys of her brothers, well played by Lloyd Bridges and occasionally over played by Earl Holliman, Lizzie returns from a visit to a family of eligible bachelors without a beau. Although her sights had originally been set on Wendell Corey, a divorced sheriff who is disguised as a widower, he is an independent man and prefers to remain in the single state. Enter Starbuck, a flamboyant con man, played to the hilt by Burt Lancaster, who was born to inhabit such roles. Starbuck is cousin to Elmer Gantry, the Crimson Pirate, and other athletic extroverts that created Lancaster's larger-than-life screen persona, and Lancaster plays to this image in "The Rainmaker." Meanwhile, Hepburn is at the peak of her aging spinster parts, which also include such indelible women as those in "The African Queen" and "Summertime." Together, the two stars captivate viewers and lend credence to a some-times predictable story line. Actually, during a few of playwright N. Richard Nash's over-wrought scenes, the cast seems about to burst into song, which makes the play's subsequent musical adaptation, "110 in the Shade," almost inevitable.Despite the film's flaws, patient viewers who persist beyond the first half hour will be rewarded. Although Hepburn became mannered as her later career progressed, the portrayal of Lizzie Curry does not rely on ticks and quivering chins, and the sensitive dreamer beneath the weathered woman shines through with the help of Lancaster's charismatic Starbuck. Hepburn's glowing demeanor, when faced with a cross-roads decision that she has dreamed of for years, will bring a tear to all but the toughest in the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Egregious miscasting of Katharine Hepburn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1956, and Hepburn is 49 years old, and we are supposed to believe that she is the "old maid" sister of a couple of young fellas, while her father looks about the right age to be her husband.The movie is set in about 1910, out on the prairie, with shiny vintage automobiles sitting around what is obviously, awkwardly, only a stage-set town. (Hepburn's accent, however, continues to reek of Eastern refinement--is it possible that her late, unmentioned mother was a displaced Main Liner?) She's trim &amp; capable &amp; likes to wear pants, but we're supposed to believe she's yearning to press a man's suit for him, to be "womanly," to be "needed"! (That KH, who is still alive at 92 &amp; has NEVER married after a very brief episode in youth, could say such lines!) Of course, in 1956 we can't be told flat out that she is going to wither up and die if she can't have sex before she's too old to enjoy it, but this is implied.So we have a climactic scene in a barn, where Burt L. takes her hair down &amp; kisses--yes, kisses her. ("Have you ever been KISSED before?" he says to her when "it's all over.") While she's out in the barn being "kissed," her real boyfriend, who's been too shy to communicate with her, shows up, &amp; she's torn (supposedly) between the passionate, dangerous stranger who's just deflowered her &amp; this shy guy who's been a non-starter. And she, unaccountably, chooses the shy guy, presumably because he's on the side of law &amp; order (vs. poetry &amp; anarchy). So, Lancaster (who doesn't seem at all downcast by her decision) drives off into the rain.The only fascination this movie has for me is in watching a really good actress, Hepburn, do her best with a totally implausible situation and lines that are so out of character she must have reminded herself constantly of how much she was being paid to utter them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE RAINMAKER (Joseph Anthony, 1956) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To prove that he was not merely an athletic actor in the Errol Flynn mould, Burt Lancaster would occasionally dabble in film adaptations of serious stage plays from the likes of William Inge and Tennessee Williams; this is his third such attempt ? albeit taken from a lesser-known author (N. Richard Nash) and with a more optimistic outcome (in fact, it was later musicalized on Broadway as "110 In The Shade")! That 1964 revamp shared with this straight film version its director Joseph Anthony, here making his first of just six efforts in that capacity. For a self-proclaimed atheist, Lancaster did his fair share of hammy, arm-waving 'preaching' on the screen and this is his first instance as such ? portraying travelling con man Bill Starbuck whose "rainmaking" capabilities are just what this film's drought-ridden Southern town needs; on the other side of the coin is "plain" old- maid-in-the-making Lizzie Curry played by an overage Katharine Hepburn. I have to admit to a curious antipathy towards this most decorated of screen actresses and, indeed, her (by turns) moving and embarrassing performance here garnered nominations at the Oscars (her seventh), BAFTAs (third) and Golden Globe (second); the film itself earned a handful of other awards (Earl Holliman was named Best Supporting Actor at the Globes) and nominations (a second Oscar nod for Alex North's typically fine score; Golden Globe nods to Lancaster and the film; and another one for Nash at the Writers Guild Awards). Unsurprisingly embracing (as opposed to eschewing) its theatrical origins given the "performance" subtext that permeates the entire plot, the film has its fair share of good scenes which (apart from the opening sequence) revolve around the eight characters that seemingly inhabit this town: Wendell Corey (as the 'widowed' deputy), Lloyd Bridges (as Hepburn's equally cynical brother), Cameron Prud'Homme (as her well-meaning father), the aforementioned Holliman (as her spunky younger brother), Wallace Ford (as the elderly Sheriff) and Yvonne Fedderson (as Holliman's red-cap wearing girlfriend); the whole makes for a pleasant if not especially outstanding romantic drama about the interior beauty of lonely people. For the record, the play was later also brought to the small screen in 1982 by a past master of the medium (John Frankenheimer) with Tommy Lee Jones and Tuesday Weld in the leading roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>no dice...despite A-list actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Rainmaker" released in 1956 - has some of the finest actors of its time. Katharine Hepburn, Lloyd Bridges, and Burt Lancaster being the principle players. Not even they can save this completely over acted melodrama. First of all, Hepburn is horribly miscast as a shy spinster - despite her brilliance as an actress, not even she can pull this off. She is too strong to be credible as being this much of a simpleton, and was just too old for the part. Lancaster over acts to the extreme, and Earl Holliman is way too hammy and comes off more like Jethro Clampett. Only Bridges and the ever reliable Wendell Corey seem to rise above the cast a bit - but even they can only do so much. It seems like the 1950's was a time when Katharine Hepburn wanted to spread her wings a bit as an actress, and that is fine. She just made a bad choice here. Fortunately for her fans (me being among them) she didn't make too many of them. Despite an A-list cast and good production values, it doesn't work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sturdy film adaptation of a well-received stage drama. Burt Lancaster is perfectly suited to theatrical role of a con-man out West who befriends a folksy family and convinces them he can make it rain on their drought-ridden land. N. Richard Nash's play becomes hearty vehicle for a hand-picked cast, with Lancaster mercurial as ever and Katharine Hepburn appealing as a sweet spinster who could use the rain--and then some! A bit encumbered and awkward at the beginning, though this is compensated for by the handsome production and sterling players (including Wallace Ford, Wendell Corey and Lloyd Bridges).

		<shortDescription>one of the few Burt Lancaster films I hated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I generally LIKE watching Burt Lancaster's films--especially when he is needed to go nuts with his imposing screen presence like in Elmer Gantry. However, his greatest strength, his magnetism, was occasionally also his greatest weakness as he rarely, if ever, underplayed ANYTHING. And it is this lack of subtlety that really hinders The Rainmaker. Now I understand that his character was meant to be a sort of showman but how Katherine Hepburn could fall under his spell is completely inexplicable. She is supposed to be smart but doesn't seem so when Lancaster's blarney is being thrown about the screen! In addition to this, the story is perhaps one of the most stagy looking films I have ever seen and it is way too obvious that this is a movie based on a play. It just looks like it was mostly filmed in a sound stage instead of in the great wide open West like it was supposed to be.Overall, a very overrated film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The drought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Starbuck is a cunning man that can enchant small town folks with the fake promises the products he peddles will do miracles. As we come to the story, he is trying to unload devices that will help folks with tornadoes, so prevalent in that part of the country. Unfortunately, he is found out and must flee before being arrested. The countryside in rural Texas is broiling under the strong summer sun. No rain has fallen in quite some time. The Currys, H.C., the father, Noah and Jim are at the train station to meet Lizzie, the daughter, and sibling that has gone on a trip and is coming home. The Currys are obsessed in finding her a husband. Lizzie, a woman of a 'certain age' seems resigned for her own old maid status.When Bill Starbuck arrives at the Curry ranch, he sees the three men in a field where a few dead animals lay on the ground because of the drought conditions in the area. Later, Starbuck arrives unannounced at the ranch. The Currys have invited the sheriff to come to dinner, something that was arranged to see if the lawman would click with Lizzie. The sheriff File never got over the way his wife left him for another man, so he is reluctant to begin any other relationship if he can help it.That night, Lizzie, realizing her prospects of ever getting any man interested in her, goes to the barn where Starbuck has been staying. Their meeting does not begin well, but Starbuck guesses what is causing this woman's troubles. Having a gift of gab, he convinces her she is her worst enemy and seduces her. Lizzie responds in kindness because for the first time in her life she has felt wanted for the first time in her life.Joseph Anthony directed the screen adaptation of Richard Nash Broadway play. The original cast included Geraldine Page and Darren McGavin as Lizzie and Starbuck. The film version was blessed with the unusual pairing of Katherine Hepburn and Burt Lancaster. In fact, Ms. Hepburn had starred in "Summertime", released the previous year. It was, in a way, a variation on the same theme, but in another setting and context. Lizzie was a variation of the character she had played successfully, although not in the least intentionally. The only thing the movie does not avoid is the feeling it is nothing but filmed stage play.Burt Lancaster as Starbuck deserves a lot of credit for giving his character a lot of the poetry that it required. Director Joseph Anthony got a great performance of this actor. Katherine Hepburn's contribution to the film is enormous. Her chemistry with her co-stars was one of the best things in the film. Wendell Corey, Lloyd Bridges, Earl Holliman, and Cameron Prud'Homme rounded up the cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Putting the Rain in Plain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading the DVD sleeve description of "The Rainmaker" certainly opens the door to different interpretations. It says here, "Under the spell of a wandering charlatan named 'Starbuck', a lonely ranch girl blossoms into full womanhood. Katharine Hepburn garnered an 'Oscar' nomination as the 'believably plain yet magnificently beautiful' tomboy rancher, with Burt Lancaster brilliantly cast in the role of the smooth-talking con man who sells his rainmaking 'powers' to unsuspecting, drought-ridden Western towns." Ms. Hepburn is clearly neither a "ranch girl" nor a "tomboy rancher" in the film. My impression was that she was a spinster, with some advanced (for the time) degree of education in her background.Hepburn's "Lizzie" correctly amends her "plain" character as, "plain? as plain as old shoes." In progression, Lancaster addresses her as "Lady," then "sister," then "girl." Hepburn's characterization has different timbre than original play; obviously, the actress was taking her age and background into consideration. Hepburn and Lancaster effectively use bits and pieces of their own personalities in the lead roles. It helps that director Joseph Anthony keeps the film theatrical-looking. The camera moves well, and deliberately with the performers. So, you feel like you are watching a stage play. Sets and setting are also permitted to be less realistic. In these ways, the film shows itself to be aware of casting shadows.Another stand-out in the "older" cast is Earl Holliman, who certainly must be playing a teenager, or is endearingly dim-witted? Interestingly, the two performers most arguably too old for their parts received the greatest award recognition - Mr. Holliman with a "Golden Globe" win as the year's "Best Supporting Actor", and Hepburn with her "Academy Award" nomination. Mr. Lancaster was also deservedly praised, and would extend his "Starbuck" to his award-winning "Elmer Gantry" (1960). Wendell Corey, Lloyd Bridges, and Cameron Prud'homme also contribute intriguing performances. Much credit should go to N. Richard Nash, who wrote a story that strikes collective chords in the human consciousness.********* The Rainmaker (12/13/56) Joseph Anthony, N.

		<shortDescription>But Lancaster Shines, Kate Hepburn Burns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie when I first saw it 40 years ago. I remember being dazzled by Burt Lancaster's performance. Seeing it again, Burt Lancaster's performance is still wonderful, but I see a lot more flaws in the film as a whole.People have weighed in on the central issue of Katherine Hepburn's performance. Some think it is a great performance and some think that she is miscast. I think both are right. She does a wonderful acting job, filled with nice moments, but she is miscast in the role. She breaks what I will name now as the "Seven Year Rule". While an actor or actress can easily always play older, they should never play a character more than seven years younger than they are. You can get away with playing a high school student until you're about 24. After that, it looks fake. By the way, this rule works for male actors too. Gary Cooper ruined "Love in the Afternoon" when at 56 he tried to play a 40 year old having an affair with a 20 year old looking Audrey Hepburn.In this movie, Hepburn, who was 49 at the time, was playing a character who was supposed to be around 30. She could have passed for 42, but no-one could have mistaken her for a 30 year old. At 30 a woman desperate for a man to marry her is still a source of comedy, at 42, it is really a source for bathos. Still at times, she does make you look past her age and feel the depth of emotion of the character.The camera placement and editing of the movie really does make it look like a stage play, although the sets are quite nice and realistic.Also, the second and third acts are really slow. If redone today, at least 20 minutes and perhaps 30 would have to be cut to give it a more modern pace. For example, a scene where the deputy is invited for dinner drags on for almost 15 minutes. It could easily have been done in 5 minutes or less.Still, we're getting some beautiful technicolor here and we're getting Burt Lancaster in one of his most exuberant and charming performances. He is having so much fun with the part that it is impossible not to enjoy the movie when he's on-screen (which is only about 40 minutes, alas.Apparently, Elvis Presley was up for the Earl Holloman role. While Hollowman did win a Golden Globe, he now seems to be overacting. Probably Elvis would have done as well and made the movie a much bigger hit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fascinating story full of tenderness and feelings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story takes place in a thriving town called "Three Point" where the family Curry lives , who now suffers from drought. The father is a patient man, with a clear commitment and trust in humans. Him, and his other two brothers (Jim and Noah), deals with the eldest daughter, "Lizzie" (Katharine Hepburn), a high and brilliant woman, of great eloquence and clear concepts, whom I see as a maid because all efforts to marry her were in vain. The family was left with the hope of the deputy sheriff, but this does not show much interest and is marked by a past that no doubt it affects their decisions.Then comes in. "Bill Starbuck" (Burt Lancaster), a braggart as skilled with the language as Lizzie, and who gets to offer a "special service" is able, within 24 hours, make it rain on those thirsty lands . The family provides the game, where "Lizzie" the only one who uses logic and shows rejection.But the wind is caressing, and soon, between those warm and sensitive characters begin to emerge their greatest weaknesses, and at the same time, are flourishing his greatest strengths. And then, begin to brew a true miracle in this charming family and completely renewed that fertile land.A fascinating story, full of tenderness, marked feelings, with an inner envelope and recognized the powers that sometimes we have no never know.Joseph Anthony, versatile American director with a long and distinguished career in Broadway theater, get a flawless film debut staging with a narrative force that gets completely fascinated.Katharine Hepburn, again to account for his greatness as an actress and Burt Lancaster gives the measure with that character, in the end, proves to be much more than just a con man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute romantic perfection!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely love this production! Missed it in the movie theatre so long ago, and was delighted when it was released on DVD. This version of the Broadway play was perfectly cast with an ensemble of wonderful actors who delivered well of their individual roles.Nobody could do it better than Burt Lancaster, as he was always bigger than life itself--a true Hollywood star! Katharine Hepburn acquitted the role of Lizzie perfectly, as well. Young Earl Holliman made a great enthusiastic younger brother and Lloyd Bridges the stern and controlling older brother was fine, too.The only change I would desire would be to film it on location, as it was so obviously filmed on a sound stage or back lot; however, back when it was produced, only really big budget movies were filmed elsewhere.What I liked most was the recurrent theme that ran through the entire story--the importance of believing in oneself. That theme touched all of the cast except for Lizzie's father and the nearby aging town sheriff. All in all, this is a warm-hearted family movie with a little comedy sprinkled over it for good measure. Sit back and enjoy the stars of the past and the good side of Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lizzie Curry (Katharine Hepburn) is a spinster living with her father and her two brothers (Lloyd Bridges).The town sheriff File who is a widower holds some secret desires, but is unwilling to act on them.The town is suffering from a drought, and everybody is desperate for water including the Currys. Then comes Bill Starbuck (Burt Lancaster) who claims to be a Rainmaker. Is he a huckster or is he real? But maybe more importantly, will he show Lizzie how beautiful she truly is?Katharine is acting too big, but I guess it's the style of the era. Burt is masterful as the big showman. He has the big personality to pull it off. However his motivations are too unclear for the audience to root for fully. When you add Lloyd Bridges, there are truly big star power at work. And they can paper over any minor imperfections.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dry Spell...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now here's a film that hasn't stood the test of time. Burt Lancaster plays Bill Starbuck, a larger-than-life conman who happens upon a small town in the grip of a seemingly endless drought. Katharine Hepburn is the daughter of a local farmer who sees right through his sales pitch, but who softens towards him as she struggles to come to grips with what looks like a barren, loveless future. Earl Holliman and Lloyd Bridges play her over-protective brothers.More often than not, The Rainmaker belies its stage origins with limited attempts to open out the action and for the most part using sound stages rather than location shooting. Perhaps the most curious aspect of the film is the acting: everyone shouts and hollers at each other in hayseed accents as if they're in some screwball comedy or a Beverly Hillbillies episode, and I regularly half-expected them to suddenly burst into song. Hepburn in particular, is horribly overwrought (and about twenty-five years too old for her role) but her often quite terrible performance is completely overshadowed by Holliman's over-playing as her younger brother. Lancaster overacts too, but at least he brings a genuinely vigorous joie-de-vivre to his role.There isn't much of a story here, either. The town's drought is a metaphor for daughter Lizzie's love life, and Starbuck is there to moisten the parts man and nature have so far failed to reach. That Lizzie's father would approve of her enjoying a romp in the hay loft with this admittedly charismatic but also devilish stranger just so she can at least have something to look back on in the long years of spinsterhood that lie ahead of her is strange to say the least. It's an attitude that seems at odds with Lizzie's professed desire to devote her life to domestic servitude to a strong man. Either way, this isn't the type of film that rewards anything more than passing consideration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hepburn Miscast in "Rainmaker"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Rainmaker" is all wet.Thanks to a badly miscast Katherine Hepburn (who is almost 50 here, and looks like she's trying to play 25-30, and a truly obnoxious performance by Earl Holliman, plus an awful directing job by Joseph Anthony turn what could have been an interesting story of how a woman discovers how to believe in herself, into a farce that is barely watchable.It seems as though Mr. Anthony did not trust the script (by N. Richard Nash, based on his play), and just told his actors that the bigger you play your roles, the better the film will be. I believe a director like Fred Zinnemann or George Stevens could have made this into a really glorious film.The story is a simple one. Bill Starbuck (played magnificently by Burt Lancaster, who looks as though he's warming up for "Elmer Gantry") is a huckster who convinces a family that for $100, he can make it rain, and thereby end a drought. What he actually does is end the drought in heart of Lizzie Curry, the daughter of the rancher who gave Starbuck the $100. He gets her to believe in herself, and in doing so he falls in love with her.The message of the film about believing in and loving yourself is very powerful. Hepburn does do a terrific job in these latter scenes. But her performance is so mannered and "over the top" in the first half of the picture, that you just don't buy the transformation.And Holliman seems as though he's about to go on auditions for "The Beverly Hillbillies" or "Hee-Haw".In the end, the film is worth seeing for Lancaster's performance only. But it is a magnificent performance.6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is there a 5-minute sequence anywhere in this movie where someone isn't either laughing, crying, yelling, throwing a punch, or more likely multiple characters doing all of the above? To me the best performance was easily Wendell Corey.. the only one not seemingly possessed by multiple personalities. His first scene about having a dog named "dog" is a great bit of "dramedy", and in the one-one-one with Hepburn he looks just like what File is... a man who might be in love but terrifed at the thought of showing his hand and getting burned. OK, right after the dog scene he does punch somebody, but "he had it coming"... and a nice swing too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the rainmaker is the inspiration behind the Indian movie guide</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rainmaker (1956) by Richard Nash In a world of drought comes a man who imagines himself to be a "rainmaker". This character has deep inner conflict between his passionate belief that he can bring the rain, although he has never been able to do it, and his terrible fear that he's a fool or mad. He meets a woman, falls in love, then suffers as she tries to believe in him, but turns away, convinced he's a charlatan or worse. He has a strong conflict with society ? some follow him as if he's a messiah; others want to stone him out of town. Lastly he faces implacable conflict with the physical world ? hot winds, empty skies, parched earth. If this man can struggle through all his inner and personal conflicts, against social and environmental forces and finally coax rain out of a cloudless sky, that storm would be majestic and sublimely meaningful. This is the story outline of "The Rainmaker" which was adapted to screen by Richard Nash from his own play. This has been described in the book titled "story"The Hindi classic Guide (1965) directed Vijay Anand based on the eponymous novel by R.K Narayanan seems very similar. Raju the "Guide" has the same inner and outer conflicts. He also falls in love with a woman who happens to be a dancer and married. He goes through sufferings as she becomes famous. He walks away from her but his mind still carries the baggage of the past. He reaches a drought ridden town where people think he's a messiah who can bring rain. Some people try to stone him to chase him out of the town. Lastly he faces the final conflict of the spirit and the flesh ? hot winds, empty skies, parched earth and the gods of the temple. He struggles through all his inner and personal conflicts,(with a fast- unto-death )against social, environmental and spiritual forces to finally coax rain out of the cloudless sky.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is something curiously "off"and unsatisfying about this otherwise engaging movie with its all-star, ca. 1950's lineup. It really should be a musical! There were times when the action paused and I really waited for Kate to do a song about the perils of being plain, or for Burt to sing about putting on a happy face, followed by Kate's "I feel pretty." (I think I read that it was later turned into a musical on Broadway). Trouble is the first two-thirds of the movie was a believable, non-romantasized portrayal of a likeable big family...a sort of "Big Valley" or "Bonanza" clan, who suddenly looked dysfunctional when diagnosed by "dreamer/con-man" Burt Lancaster. Over-responsible (but well-intentioned) big brother Lloyd Bridges was the character who lost the most ground as the tone of the movie veered into a non-musical "musical", but it was overall unsatisfying to be unexpectedly steep in psychobabble about self esteem and soul searching and not liking this family anymore. A movie I was loving turned into one that I thought would never end. Still, Kate did a great job, whooping and hollering with her brothers when the rain and the movies' end (finally, mercifully, blessedly) came.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There once was an ugly duckling...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rainmaker is directed by Joseph Anthony and written by N. Richard Nash. It stars Burt Lancaster, Katharine Hepburn, Wendell Corey, Lloyd Bridges, Cameron Prud'Homme and Earl Holliman. Music is by Alex North and VistaVision/Technicolor cinematography is by Charles Lang.Starbuck (Lancaster) is a conman who arrives in the little town of Threepoint and promises to deliver the rain to end the town's crippling drought problem. More telling, perhaps, will be his impact on the Curry family...N. Richard Nash wrote it as a television play and would then see it hit the Broadway stage, so he was the logical choice for screenplay duties here. The film very much feels like a play, with very pronounced acting and sharp dialogue, it's also - at just over two hours in length - far too long for a talky based production. Thirty minutes could quite easily have been shaved off here. There's also the contentious casting of the Oscar Nominated Hepburn, who in many people's eyes - myself included - is miscast and just doesn't sit right in the role, leaving it to Lancaster to bring the flight and breeze to light up the piece.However, to enjoy the art of acting brings some rewards, it's also a pic of crafty humour and features a story of considerable humane substance. That one man, a scallywag, can have such a positive impact on a sterile backwater family, builds nicely to an ending that is a complete joy, a real smile raiser. It's also handsomely photographed by Lang, the colour lensing so smooth, and the production design, backed up by North's most appealing musical score, ensures you know that the makers cared about what they were doing. Relationships on set were initially rocky, but the principal stars would come to be friends and speak fondly of their time on the film. 6/10Footnote: The material would also be turned into a musical titled 110 in the Shade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, what a revelation this movie is! By it's title I was expecting it to be all about con-man and rapscallion Bill Starbuck (Burt Lancaster), but it takes a wonderful little detour into the home life of the Curry Family, and the attempts of Pop H.C. (Cameron Prud'Homme) and sons Noah (Lloyd Bridges) and Jim (Earl Holliman) to marry off sister Lizzie (Katharine Hepburn). Sensitive viewers may tackle a misty eye here for Lizzie's old maid outlook on life, as she tries to process the worldly advice of the would be Rainmaker. Lancaster's character bursts on the screen with all the manic energy of a fast talker and out-sized showman, but his insight into the human condition is decidedly accurate for Lizzie, who comes to see herself in a new light and believe in herself once again. 'All women are pretty in a different way, but they're all pretty' is the way he awakens Lizzie's self-confidence, and her transformation is a wonder to behold. The picture's valuable lesson for most everyone is that you can't get stuck inside your dreams or live outside of them, but find them somewhere in between. It's almost too simple a message, but it's one that works for the person who finds themselves here, there and nowhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-acting. Guilty as charged!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two main faults with this movie. The lesser fault: (although it may contribute to the larger fault) is that the director (Joseph Anthony) had more of a history in stage work than films, and it shows. In fact, I didn't know of Anthony until watching this film, but even before I looked him up, this film felt very "stagey" to me.The bigger problem here is overacting by a number of the actors...and my guess is that that related directly to the film's director. Burt Lancaster sometimes tended to overact, such as can be seen in "Elmer Gantry" and here; he is better when he exhibits self-control such as in "Airport" and "Judgement At Nuremberg".Katherine Hepburn was always less likely to overact, and rarely does here. So her performance seems a little more realistic. Wendell Corey does alright here; less known, his performance is probably the most realistic in the film. Lloyd Bridges always more suited to television, but he was sometimes pretty decent in films; here, however, he also overacts. Although not as badly as Earl Holliman does here -- truly excessive. Cameron Prud'Homme as the father is okay...with a little overacting.Despite the preponderance of overacting, there are some good scenes here. Particularly notable are some of the scenes between Katherine Hepburn and Burt Lancaster when both drop the overacting and control themselves.The story is a decent one, although there are times that the musical scores almost makes you believe that the actors are about ready to burst into song.On balance, due to the deficiencies noted, I'll have to give this film a 6, which I consider to be below average. I'm glad I watched it...once, but I won't want to ever watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rainmaker is the 1956 film version of the N Richard Nash play about a slick-talking con man who breezes into a sleepy little town, suffering from a serious drought, who promises he can bring rain while bringing some magic into the life of a lonely spinster.Burt Lancaster turns in one of his most charismatic performances as Bill Starbuck, the fast-talking con man whose ego definitely outweighs his actual abilities. Katherine Hepburn received a Best Actress nomination for her performance as Lizzie Curry, a buttoned-up spinster who bristles at the phrase, "Old Maid", no matter how many times her father and her brother Noah sling it her way. It is the brief encounter of these two people from completely different worlds, who have no business being together, who make a special connection, which may or may not be genuine, that makes this story so special.Lloyd Bridges and Earl Holliman provide solid support as Lizzie's brothers, Noah and Jimmy, who have completely different feelings about Starbuck and Wendell Corey is wonderful as File, the local deputy who has been fighting feelings for Lizzie and realizes that with Starbuck around, he has to put up or shut up.Nash adapted his own play for the screen with care and though Joseph Anthony's direction is a little static, giving the film the look of a photographed stage play, the performances by the stars more than compensate. The story was later turned into a Broadway musical called 110 IN THE SHADE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all Hepburn . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was Katharine Hepburn best performance.She plays Lizzy Curry, a forty-something spinster living on a ranch with her father and two brothers during the drought in Kansas. When we meet her she has just come back from visiting relatives to a home she shares with the three men in her life, father H.C. (Cameron Prud'Homme), and her brothers, the overbearing Noah (Lloyd Bridges) and soft-headed Jim (Earl Holliman). Lizzy is a smart woman with a big heart and a lot of love to give but believes that her plain looks will make her an old maid.She would like to be courted by the town sheriff, File (Wendall Corey), but is so lacking in confidence, that her father and brothers go into town and ask him over for dinner. He reluctantly agrees but when Lizzy tries to downplay her own intelligence so not to make him feel intimidated, she makes a mess of the whole dinner. When he leaves, we get a sense of where some of her self-loathing comes from as her brother Noah heartlessly reminds her that she is plain and no man will ever love her.Onto the ranch comes Starbuck (Burt Lancaster), a fast-talking traveling huckster who makes a living selling a lightening-rod device that is supposed to prevent tornadoes. He has a gift for spinning pretty words just as a concert pianist makes beautiful music. He works his magic on H.C., convincing him that he can end the drought by making it rain ? for a meager charge of $100. Lizzy is on to him and berates him for fooling her father with such a scheme, but then he turns his magic on her, convincing her of her own worth and in the process, falling in love with her. She is charmed by this man and a tender, but brief, romance ensues. Starbuck is able to convince Lizzy of the power of her own worth, that she is beautiful and that any man would be glad to have a woman with a heart as big as hers.The beauty of their scenes together come from the fact that, while we know Starbuck is a trickster, his approach to Lizzy is quite genuine. He is able to bring sunshine into her life and in her heart that she has kept bottled up for years. When, in the end, it does start to rain, it is as if the dammed up emotion in Lizzy's heart has come spilling over. Her drought has ended, just as it has for the land.I am glad that Hepburn was nominated for this performance; it is one of her best. As I have mentioned before, I did not like any of the four performances that brought her Oscars because they seem (three at least) to be just dutiful housewives who stand beside their men. I, too, have chosen Hepburn four times for her performances as Alice Adams in Alice Adams, Tracy Lord in The Philadelphia Story, Jane Hudson in Summertime and now as Lizzy in The Rainmaker. What these four women have in common is that they all have big hearts but desire the physical beauty or the confidence to be loved on their own merits. They stand for women born without great physical beauty, who have to work a little harder to find someone special.Through Hepburn's expressive face, we understand the pain within and the need to express love and to be loved, to feel needed. Of the four performances I have chosen from Hepburn's career, Lizzy may be the most complete, because she comes full circle and we sense, in the end, that her happiness won't be temporary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of interest only for seeing Lancaster and Hepburn together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are films that age well, and there are films that age very well, so well in fact that they almost feel timeless somehow, because everything works so perfectly or near perfectly that the film feels flawless. This is not one of those films. Based on the stage play of the same name, which was loosely based on a real man, "The Rainmaker", directed by its own original stage handler Joseph Anthony, is the story of a, ahem, "plain" woman in danger of becoming an old maid, Lizzie Curry (Katharine Hepburn), her unrequited love for the town sheriff (Wendell Corey), her dysfunctional family (father H.C. played by Cameron Prud'Homme and "big brothers" the overbearing Noah played by Lloyd Bridges and Jim played by Earl Holliman, who somehow won an award for his obnoxious performance) and their encounter with a dashing, charismatic con man known as Bill Starbuck (Burt Lancaster, in what feels like a prototype for his Oscar winning role in "Elmer Gantry") who, ahem, helps Lizzie become "a real woman" unleashing her, um, true beauty or some such. He even manages to get it to rain during their drought. Overlong, slow pacing, and obvious inexperienced direction of a motion picture film (vs the live stage) result in an awkward, unpleasant soap opera that could've been better had it focused on either just the dysfunctional family or the social ramifications of the con man's effect on the town during the drought, also not helped by the very old fashioned, outdated ideology of its core characters, despite how hard it tries to be a sensitive examination of the hopes and dreams of regular people. One of the film's biggest sins is the miscasting of Katharine Hepburn as the "PLAIN PLAIN PLAIN!" Lizzie. The first obvious flaw is that Hepburn, who was pushing 50 at the time, is clearly too old for the character (everyone reacts to her as if she still has time to start a family of her own, which she very much wants), making it all the more awkward if not outrightly bizarre to watch a middle aged woman grapple with adolescent issues, as well as off setting a number of her scenes with other characters - she's supposed to be the daughter of Prud'Homme but looks and feels like she should be his wife (he was only 14 years older than Hepburn in real life - a case where an actor couldn't pull it off) and instead of a young woman full of sexual frustration in her scenes with Lancaster she feels like she should be the widow he takes advantage of. Then there's the idea that Hepburn was so ungodly unattractive that she could only ever be "PLAIN!" (which everyone, especially Bridges, keeps saying as if what they really mean is ugly), when even a middle aged Hepburn still had some beauty about her. I couldn't help being reminded of Kate's role in "Bringing Up Baby" where she also played a woman hung up on a man, and she felt just as miscast there as she does here. Perhaps some of it was her real life personality shining through, but the boy/man crazy types were never her strong suit. The other actors do what they can (Holliman is downright unbearable and will have the audience cheering every time he gets hit), but in the end the best thing about this film is Burt Lancaster. Some accuse him of being a large ham here, but at least his natural go for broke energy and charisma brings some much needed life to the dull proceedings, and he also manages to show his subtle side in his scenes with Hepburn. It's a shame these two iconic stars - both well known for their fiery, sometimes frightening personalities off camera - didn't have a better film, but in the end the film is worth a rental for their scenes together. But only for a rental.</fullReview>

But she has to teach deputy File, and the dreamer Starbuck what relationships is all about. While at the same time put up with the oldest brother(Noah) being a negative nay-bob(you are an old maid). Young Jim Curry also has to put up with being put in his place by his older brother "why do I always feel stupid when you talk to me Noah?". The play has been made into a musical (110 in the shade) with cowboys and yippees. But this movie script(1956) being more modern would make a blockbuster musical with it's romance genre.

		<fullReview>In a small town in the early 1900s, a spinster's father and brothers try to find a man for her. This comedy-drama is based on a play and the stage origins are quite evident. The sets are confined and the dialog is contrived. The biggest drawback is that the acting has not been adjusted for the screen. The blame for this mostly falls upon Anthony, a stage director making his first film. Lancaster, warming up for his role in "Elmer Gantry," starts chewing the scenery from the first shot and never lets up. Hepburn appears too old, too attractive, and too smart for the role of the plain spinster. Holliman is annoyingly hammy as Hepburn's dim-witted brother.

		<fullReview>Based on a Richard Nash play and directed by Joseph Anthony, "The Rainmaker" stars Katharine Hepburn as an ageing spinster who's unluckiness with love have led to her becoming bitter, callous, cynical and skeptical of men. Mirrored to Hepburn is Starbuck, a character played by Burt Lancaster. He's a charming conman who promises - for a fee of course - to bring rain to the drought inflicted farmlands of superstitious suckers.The film delights in clashing Starbuck's optimism with Hepburn's pessimism. It's larger point, though, is that Hepburn's pessimism is both the result of her fierce intelligence and masks a deep, optimistic yearning. She's a hopeless romantic, always believes, is the film's true optimist, whilst it is Starbuck who cynically exploits others and has no faith in his abilities to conjure up rain. The film's end, of course, espouses a healthy merging of both stances.Today "The Rainmaker" is mocked for its wild, hysterical acting. It's a good example of a certain "type" of acting, though, and Hepburn's performance here was once frequently used to teach young theatre actors. Lancaster, meanwhile, is as over-the-top as always, his character imbued with the same manic energy which made his early action/adventure movies so memorable. Yes everyone in the film (Lloyd Bridges, Hepburn, Lancaster) is too old for their roles, the film's too theatrical, too on-the-nose, but Nash's script goes into some dark places, and scenes in which Hepburn lays bare her insecurities regarding her plain body, her fears of loneliness, her acceptance of her own virginity, are shockingly frank. Elsewhere the film does well to show how superstition and a kind of grim logic tend to both operate in the same space and facilitate each another. Starbuck's superstitions mask his weaknesses, his insecurity, his disbelief, whilst Hepburn's cold logic masks her longings, her fantasies, her private delusions. The film is ridiculously heavy-handed, but in its theatricality is able to sketch out regions which most art can't.7.9/10 - Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adapted from a Stage Play, and It Shows</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Rainmaker" is, officially, a Western. It is set in a small town rural town in the West, (probably in the 1920s or 1930s, to judge from the cars and costumes we see), but it bears little resemblance to most Westerns from the fifties. This was the decade when the cinema first faced serious competition from television, and spectacular Westerns featuring exciting action sequences shot against the dramatic scenery of the American West were one of Hollywood's major weapons in its fight against the newcomer. ("Shane", "The Naked Spur", "The Searchers" and "The Big Country" are all good examples). This film, by contrast, is adapted from a stage play, and it shows.The plot is a simple one. It is a hot summer and the area is suffering from a severe drought. A man calling himself Bill Starbuck arrives in town, promising that he can make it rain. A spinster named Lizzie Curry falls in love with him. The film tells the story of the effect which Starbuck has on Lizzie and the other townspeople. The film's message is, effectively, "learn to love yourself and to believe in yourself". Starbuck, of course, is not a genuine rainmaker but a con-man; even his real surname is not Starbuck but Smith. The important thing is that he projects such assurance and self-belief that others accept him as genuine, and under his influence Lizzie, hitherto put upon and patronised by her father and two brothers for whom she acts as housekeeper on the family cattle ranch, learns to believe in herself too.I have never seen the play on which "The Rainmaker" is based, so I do not know how well this story might work on the stage. (I understand that it is a staple of the American theatre, but on this side of the Atlantic both the play and its author, one N. Richard Nash, are virtually unknown). Unfortunately, the film does not work for me, and when I recently saw it on television I was disappointed; I had been hoping for something far better, given that it stars two actors as talented as Burt Lancaster and Katharine Hepburn.Part of the problem is miscasting. Hepburn is quite wrong for the part of Lizzie for three reasons, namely age, looks and personality. We never learn exactly how old Lizzie is, but I think we are supposed to assume that she is considerably younger than Hepburn's 49 years at the time the film was made, possibly in her thirties. Secondly, Lizzie is supposed to be plain, whereas Hepburn in her youth was considered one of Hollywood's most beautiful actresses, and even in her late forties was still strikingly handsome. Thirdly, and most importantly, Hepburn spent most of her career playing strong, independent and capable woman, and is not really credible as a downtrodden, put-upon spinster lacking in self-confidence. Her "Best Actress" Oscar nomination today seems incredible. (Mind you, there seems to have been something odd going on at the Academy Awards for 1956; that was the year which saw Don Murray's bizarre "Best Supporting Actor" nomination for his awful performance in "Bus Stop" and Kirk Douglas unaccountably losing "Best Actor" to Yul Brynner). Lancaster as Starbuck is better suited to his role, but this is not one of his great performances and he was to be far better as another charismatic con-man, Elmer Gantry, four years later.My other problem with the film is to do with the direction. I was not surprised to learn that Joseph Anthony was a theatrical director who directed Nash's play on stage but had never previously directed a movie, as he seems to have made this film on the basis that there was no essential difference between the two media. There is little attempt to open the story out and little in the way of action; most scenes take place indoors and consist mainly dialogue rather than physical action. The result is a static, talky film, dominated by interminable conversations. Another reviewer claims that the film could have been far better had it been made by a major cinema director such as Fred Zinnemann or George Stevens who would no doubt have escaped from the "filmed theatre" style of film-making and made maximum use of the greater freedom which the cinematic medium offers. That is doubtless true, but I suspect that Zinnemann or Stevens, or any of the other great directors of the period, would have demanded from the producers more artistic freedom and a much greater budget than Anthony appears to have had at his disposal. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rainmaker- When It Rains, It Pours But Cloudburst Doesn't Help **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even the great Katharine Hepburn and Burt Lancaster can't help this film dealing with a woman who has little prospect of ever finding a husband in a rural Texas town.Hepburn plays Lizzie Curry to the hilt but she can't arise over the writing and some utterly boring scenes. Hepburn may also have been too old for the part. She was 49 in 1956.She is frustrated in her attempts to find love despite the fact that she has strong family support in her father and brothers played by Lloyd Bridges and Earl Holliman. Both gentlemen give ample support, especially Holliman, the more sympathetic to his sister's needs.Lizzie admits that she is no Lady Godiva or Cinderella at the ball. Bridges frankly tells her that she is plain and will remain a spinster. Remember the way that Ralph Richardson told Olivia De Havilland this in "The Heiress?"Lancaster is Starbuck, a con man who comes to the town and brings Lizzie to realize that she is more the woman than she actually thought she was. His early scenes will remind you of his Oscar winning portrayal of Elmer Gantry 4 years later.There is also another wonderful supporting performance by Wendell Corey, the town sheriff, a divorced man who can't bring himself to love Lizzie.The story is told in the backdrop of a drought hitting the small Texas town. The ending in particular is more stage like than a motion picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enchanting drama about a charlatan (Lancaster) who dupes a town into buying his rainmaking services, and a local gal (Hepburn) is particularily taken with him. Colorful performances from both stars, plus great support from Holliman, Corey and Lloyd Bridges. Hepburn was Oscar nominated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Rainmaker" is a full representation of the play itself. It captures the heart and soul of a true Romantic Comedy. The passion and spark of this movie comes alive on the screen. One can smell the rain as if sitting in the living room with the Curry's</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable directing job: Even Lancaster was good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After avoiding the film for years, I finally accidentally saw "The Rainmaker." And kicked myself for having missed it.The director, Joseph Anthony, is someone of whom I am otherwise totally unfamiliar, but he is obviously a genius. Even wooden Burt Lancaster is animated -- and, yes, he got much better as his career progressed.Perhaps the most enjoyable surprise was the performance of a favorite actor, Earl Holliman. He just really outdid himself in this. Of course, all the actors were great, but Earl Holliman had, for a change, a part worthy of his ability and he lived up to all expectations.I want to see this movie again and again, just for the direction and performances. And especially to see Earl Holliman again.</fullReview>
