		<shortDescription>A wonderfully subtle study of the nature of love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some reviewers have complained that certain parts of the movie are unbelievable--agreed. However, "A Guy Named Joe" isn't a documentary. It's a riff on the nature of love and loss. I've seen many Spencer Tracey movies, but none in which he is so subtle, charming, and heartbreaking. I won't give away his final line at the end, but it is a very simple line, delivered simply. But in his understated way, he encapsulates the most complex of human emotions.Irene Dunne, a truly fine actress, is at her best here. Yes, her style does take a little getting used to for modern audiences, but she, too, has some incredibly difficult work to do in this film, and she meets the task impressively. And Van Johnson, whom I've never really given much thought, turns in a fine performance here, early in his career. It is obvious that these three actors had a healthy rapport together. The lines of communication had to have been wide open for them to have turned in such gentle, subtly nuanced performances. I can't say enough about this film. It may sound corny, but if you have ever loved anyone, and if you have ever lost anyone, you will immediately recognize the characters in this film. It's also worth mentioning that the screenplay contains some of the most beautiful poetic language I've ever heard in a movie. If you've never seen "A Guy Named Joe," I strongly recommend it; it will do your heart good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting comparison with "Always" by Spielberg.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As many viewers I saw "Always", actually several times, before I even learned about "A Guy Named Joe." It is factual that the later film was a remake of the earlier one, but being in more modern times a significant story difference was depicted. I have no reason to compare the two against each other, for each one is a fine film on its own. Set in WW II England, "A Guy Named Joe" gets its title from a comment made by one of the British children waiting to talk to Pete after one of his bombing runs over Germany. He told one of the other children, "that's what all American soldiers are called, guys named Joe." There was no actual character named Joe in the film. I had never seen Spencer Tracy in his prime, and he was quite a handsome actor. Now I understand why he was so popular. He plays Pete, the pilot who takes unapproved chances to get difficult jobs done. In "Always", Dryfuss as Pete does the same for putting out forest fires. In both films Pete dies during a heroic mission and in heaven is sent to help a novice pilot, who ends up romancing his old girlfriend, Drinda. I understand that at least one viewer who was in WW II thinks this is not a very good or realistic film. Maybe not, but it is still entertaining, and for me interesting to see a film made the year before I was born. Worth seeking out, for anyone who also enjoyed "Always" to see where it came from. Two different films from two different times, both excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Girl Named Irene, A Guy Named Spence, and Another Guy Named Van</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful romantic picture set in World War II and I have to say Spencer Tracy has almost as much chemistry with Irene Dunne as he does with Katharine Hepburn. During his career Spencer Tracy was basically two types of character, the cryptic tough guy adventurer and later on a wise father figure. In A Guy Named Joe his Pete Sandidge gets to be both. But he has to get killed before he morphs into his second character.Spencer Tracy is an ace pilot who's over in the European Theatre and his girlfriend, Irene Dunne is also a pilot, a la Amelia Earhart. She's forever worried about the risks he takes and then her wishes turn into reality as he gets himself killed. Of course he's not quite ready to enter the pearly gates. It seems as though Heaven has an Air Corps advisory program for ghosts to advise living pilots and Spence's first assignment is Van Johnson. Wouldn't you know it, Van's the guy that's getting Irene on the rebound. Tracy's not enough of a ghost yet that the old green-eyed monster isn't grabbing hold of him. So.............................With Tracy being dead, the possibilities of endings are limited. But it's at this point that Tracy grows into the father figure character we know him better from in his later work.Van Johnson's career got a big boost from this film. He's previously been in mostly B films, a lot of them as successor to Lew Ayres in the later in the Dr. Gillespie series. He was injured in a motorcycle accident during the shooting and Spencer Tracy threatened to walk off the picture if Van was replaced. Van healed and the film started him into the upward path of his career.Irene Dunne who did almost as many musicals as straight drama in the 1930s got to sing in this film. That's always a plus. Here she sings a great rendition of I'll Get By which was enjoying a revival of popularity in the World War II years.Rounding out the supporting cast are Lionel Barrymore, Ward Bond, James Gleason, Barry Nelson, and Don DeFore all performing to their usual standards of excellence.A really great romantic film like they don't make any more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Story With Appealing Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those old-fashioned, nice stories with generally nice people, some good lessons to be learned and some touching scenes. You just have to go with the fantasy-type theologies, in this story dead people coming back as angels-you-can see.Irene Dunne never looked better, although the soft-focus lens helped her looks. She isn't beautiful but she's wholesomely pretty, and thus appealing. Spencer Tracy gives his normal strong performance but I liked supporting actor Ward Bond in here better. Tracy gives an excellent short speech at the end of this film.The special-effects in the aviator-war scenes were not good but, hey, this film was made about 65 years ago. You could tell the planes were model airplanes on several shots.Note: this film was re-made by Steven Spielberg 40 years later under the title "Always." That was a nice film, too, but I think I'd still take this version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irene Dunne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irene Dunne is what makes any movie she is in, superb! No female actor today, or for that matter in the 30s and 40s can compare to her wholesomeness, versatility, and talent! This movie was a lesson in many aspects of life. It was made during a time that these things were much needed but we can certainly apply the same selflessness to our daily lives today. It is funny and dramatic, fast moving and keeps your interest. Spencer Tracy is good, so was Van Johnson in that part! Ward Bond is always so good at anything he dose, he is such a great SUPPORTING actor he supports and complements, he always seems to be the character he is playing.Yet, again I must say Irene Dunne is a Jewel, she does every character in such a believable manner you feel they could be your next door neighbor. Thank You Irene !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful lead performances by Dunne &amp; Tracy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two very good reasons to see this charming movie are a terrific performance by Irene Dunne and the excellent interplay in the romantic relationship between Irene Dunne &amp; Spencer Tracy. The movie simply sparkles when these two are on screen together. A great script by Dalton Trumbo only adds to the rich, comedic and touching dynamic between these two fine actors. While the World War II background is not the most realistic ever filmed, it still adds to the overall story by evoking the important ways that even small individuals were affected by and contributed to the war effort.Warning spoilers ahead!The movie also showcases an uncommonly mature (for Hollywood) perspective on love as it develops between these complex, grown-up characters. Tracy genuinely evolves in a believable fashion when he comes back as an angel to advise his loved ones and the rival pilot. Dunne remains loyal to him in life and even after death, but finally honors their love by choosing not to pine away the rest of her life. Tracy is touching in their scenes together when he can't be seen by her.Still, it's Dunne who carries this affectionate movie on her very capable shoulders with a simply wonderful, strong, funny performance as an independent woman pilot who holds her own both during the war as well as in the demanding relationship banter. She's no more willing to give up flying than is Tracy. And there's a great unexpected bonus in the ending (however much it stretches credibility) where she actually pilots the plane that blows up the ammunition dump. See this movie to enjoy Dunne and Tracy and an excellent supporting cast led by Ward Bond.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a touching story about love which knows no end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best love stories ever. It isn't a war story, war simply happens to be the setting. And I don't see how a movie can prevent nations from winning a war. The whole fact that Spencer Tracy's character loves Irene Dunne's so much that he will watch her marry another man is the most amazing testimony of love. I don't know how you can watch one of the final scenes; in which Tracy and Dunne are in the plane and he says that their love is too good to make her unhappy; and still call "A Guy Named Joe," a silly movie. Again, the war was simply a setting, because war in itself isn't very interesting, it is the human experience in war which creates a story.The Fact that Spielberg enjoyed and admired it so much that he remade it also says a little for the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet film about the immortality of love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Guy Named Joe" is a beautiful, sentimental, tear-jerker of a film starring Spencer Tracy, Irene Dunne, Van Johnson, Lionel Barrymore, Ward Bond, James Gleason, and Dom Defore. Tracy is Pete, a fighter pilot in World War II involved with Dorinda (Dunne), a female flier. Apparently pilots whose "number is up" emit some kind of dead man walking spirit, because Dunne recognizes the signs and wants Pete to return to the states with her and teach fledgling pilots. She's so desperate that he agrees, but he's called for one last mission, and the inevitable happens. Before he knows it, no one can see him or hear him, he's escorted around heaven and earth by Barry Nelson, and assigned to be an angel for a young pilot (Johnson).For all the warmth of this film, it was fraught with problems behind the scenes. Van Johnson was in a horrid car accident before he finished filming. The actors said they wanted to wait for him rather than see him replaced. That story may or may not be true, as the scar on his forehead is only visible in a couple of scenes; there can't have been much left to film. The second problem was that Spencer Tracy kept coming on to Irene Dunne, which made her furious, and she complained to the front office. She never worked with him again, which is a pity, because they made a charismatic screen couple.Spencer Tracy is fantastic as a cocky pilot who comes down to earth only when he dies. His scenes as he stands behind Dunne telling her what he should have said to her while alive are very tender. Dunne is excellent as always - strong yet vulnerable, and she gets to sing "I'll Get By" in her lovely soprano. Johnson, in his breakthrough role, is good-looking, boyish, and likable. One of the nicest thing about "A Guy Named Joe" is some of the lighting effects - the silhouette of Dunne as she says goodbye to Pete; the look of his plane in the distance when she first arrives - these really add to the sense of foreboding.Strangely, when viewed today, "A Guy Named Joe" is a feminist movie in more ways than even it knew. Dunne is a female pilot and proves her mettle in a dangerous mission. But more than that, consider the fact that she becomes involved with Johnson in the film and was 18 years his senior! She was 45 when this movie was released, and Johnson was 29. The age difference is obvious. Good for her - playing a lead at that age while employed by Louis B, no less, and having a younger love interest! Mayer is the man who booted out Joan Crawford and didn't make any noise when Garbo and Shearer left.If your eyes aren't moist at the end of "A Guy Named Joe," it'll be surprising. Much loved by Steven Spielberg (who remade it), and a lot of other people, it still touches the heart today and reinforced to wartime audiences that the spirit of their deceased ones continues on, with love the tie that binds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Still Successful World War II Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The question that faces (or scares) Americans ever since the debacle of Vietnam is: is patriotism dead here. Because of that national nightmare we have questioned every government foreign policy ever since. Naturally we should question them, but it sometimes seems that our questioning causes a national paralysis of will. Time will tell (and shortly) if the Iraqi - Afghani incursions will add to this paralysis.It was not the case in 1943, when A GUY NAMED JOE was made by MGM. The film is about a hot shot air force pilot (Spencer Tracy) who is in a squadron commanded by James Gleason. Although they have a friendship, Gleason is constantly having problems about Tracy's independence from rules. Frequently they pay off in damaging the enemy, but they break safety rules. Gleason also sympathizes with Tracy's girlfriend (Irene Dunne) who wants Tracy to take a quieter job (like training fliers in the states). Just when Tracy is about to take such a job, he goes on a mission, and his plane is hit. After the crew bails out, Tracy (instead of ditching) flies the plane kamikaze style into a German aircraft carrier and sinks it (but he dies).In the afterlife, Tracy is taken under the wing of the "General" (Lionel Barrymore), and is assigned to act like a conscience or guide to budding air force pilots. He is assigned to Van Johnson, and helps him get more confidence. Johnson is assigned to a war theater where Gleason's command is, and where Dunne is. Dunne is mourning Tracy, but their closest mutual friend (Ward Bond) gets her to go out to enjoy herself. She meets Johnson, and an affair begins. Tracy gets jealous as a result. The film follows as Tracy and Dunne finally accept the truth about the ending of their physical contact. It moves to the point of tragedy here when Tracy finally releases Dunne from the harshness of the emotional chains that bind them, and that lead Dunne to do something atypical and foolhardy for the intelligent person she supposedly is. In the end she and Johnson find a new happiness together, while Tracy goes to his next "angel" assignment. Fantasy is usually tied to one set of ideas or theme, but what is good World War II American propaganda became a study in tragic resignation. Fortunately the acting level of A GUY NAMED JOE was so high, that the fantasy transcended the historical period film and left us with a film of emotional loss and rebuilding. As such it is a fine movie.One final point, on a historical level. Who is Lionel Barrymore supposed to be? He is only referred to as "the General" and he died before the war. He is highly respected as a great air figure. Tracy quickly recognizes him, and tells Barry Nelson he wanted to take him up in one of the new aircraft that had been built. So who is Barrymore supposedly?The key is the model airplane on Barrymore's desk. It is a model of a Martin Bomber. That was the plane used in 1921 to sink two battleships in Chesapeake Bay, and to prove the theories of an air power pioneer that the future of warfare was not with dreadnoughts but with air planes. The "General" is supposed to be Brigadier General Billy Mitchell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flight of fancy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all it's reportedly Steven Spielberg's favourite Hollywood movie, I found it rather awkward to watch and enjoy. I admire Spencer Tracy and Irene Dunne and found them an agreeably spiky couple for the first half hour of the film evoking memories of Cary Grant and Jean Arthur in "Only Angels Have Wings" but from that gritty introduction to the main characters, the film then "goes Capra" and into a strange fantasy with Tracy winding up in heaven after a bombing mission goes wrong and then getting the job, Clarence-style of chaperoning young buck Van Johnston to fly in his slipstream, not only as a daring pilot but also, eventually overcoming his inbuilt jealous reluctance, to supersede his own place in Dunne's grieving heart.Now I love fantasy films of this ilk, "A Matter Of Life And Death" and "It's A Wonderful Life" prominent amongst them, but here the narrative is just too fantastical and sentimental especially the coincidence of Dunne falling for Johnston, (she looks old enough to be his mother), Tracy getting the job of being Johnston's guardian angel and the ridiculous ending where Dunne carries out Johnson's so-called suicide mission, under Tracy's spectral, but watchful gaze and tutelage and of course defies death in the process.These scenes and more turn the credible into the incredible and even solid acting from the leads and exciting air-sequences couldn't convince me that this belongs in the pantheon of Golden Age Hollywood classics.Sorry Mr Spielberg...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During WW2, fighter pilot Spencer Tracy (Pete) has a maverick streak which causes him problems and gets him sent to Scotland for reconnaissance flights and eventually back to the USA to train junior pilots. However, this is not before he is given a final assignment to sink a Nazi aircraft carrier alongside several destroyers. Well, as per usual he goes all maverick and it doesn't work out too well for him. Or does it? The message of the film is one of acceptance of your situation and Tracy is perfect to lead us through the proceedings as he does indeed help those junior pilots. He also helps his partner and fellow pilot Irene Dunne (Dorinda) to come to terms with her situation as she has to let go of confinement and share out the love.It's a sentimental film that is sentimental in a good way with ghosts helping out. We have 2 locations ? Earth and the halfway-house before Heaven which is presided over by deceased ace pilot Lionel Barrymore (The General). The film is a little long and the first 45 minutes is pretty dull, an exercise in setting the scene which dragged on a bit. However, the film gets going once Tracy is given his final mission and we see the introduction of novice pilot Van Johnson (Ted). It is at this point that we also get the humour going as there is amusing dialogue from the non-mortal Tracy as he walks around in the land of the living casting disapproving facial expressions. The film is also a story for Tracy to accept his fate as his true love Irene Dunne goes off with another.Van Johnson tells an amusing story of someone who grew another foot and whilst I can see the attraction that he may have had for Dunne, I think that Esther Williams (Ellen), in a non-swimming role, was far more suited to him romantically. Ward Bond (Al) is good as Tracy's pilot pal who remains with the living but I'm afraid I cannot say the same for Commander/General James Gleason (Nails) who annoyingly barks his way through the film. Shut up Gleason! Overall, a film with a nice story ? you may get emotional. You may also start to wonder whose spirit is standing beside you, and whilst they may poke fun at you on occasion, they are ultimately there to help you along ? your Guardian Angel. I met mine in a dream ? there were two of them, a little boy and a little girl and when I asked them "Who are you?", the little boy turned around and said "I'm your Guardian Angel". And it was me at age 4?? I'm my own Guardian Angel! So, there is definitely weird stuff that goes on in life. Or in my head!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Likable Romantic Whimsy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's an efficiently staged story of Spencer Tracy and his girl friend Irene Dunne in the US Air Force in World War II. They're deeply in love. When Tracy dies a heroic death, he's sent to the Command Post in heaven and given the assignment below of shepherding young pilot Van Johnson through his training and subsequent combat in New Guinea. Irene Dunne shows up and Johnson begins courting her, much to Tracy's disgust. He ultimately gives up the power he seems to have over her and she and Van Johnson are married.The film is worth a couple of observations. One is that performers rarely get the credit they deserve for delivering the goods in comedies or, until recently, in Westerns -- with the exception of some silent comedians. Spencer Tracy's role here is mostly comic, yet it's one of his finest performances. Every line, even the corniest, seems to come directly from his character. He boasts, he sneers, he insults, he woos clumsily. He lifts the picture well above the ordinary. He gets extra credit for his skill because he doesn't LOOK at all interesting -- not handsome, not compellingly homely, just plain plain. And he doesn't have the extra juice that ethnicity or a regional dialect would give him. He looks and sounds like what he was, an ordinary guy from a small town in Wisconsin. Turning that ordinariness into a winning trait requires a certain mastery of one's art.I'll mention just one scene. Watch him just after his death. The viewer sees a vast, empty space with a few clouds in the background. The floor is covered by a foot of ground fog. (Production design by Cedric Gibbons.) Still in uniform, Tracy appears, strolling casually but purposefully towards the camera, as if he had someplace to go. His hands are in his pockets and he's whistling a pop tune. Then he spots the figure of an old friend, Barry Nelson, in the distance, dashes over to him and gives him a big hug and handshake. Boy, is he happy to meet Nelson again! Tracy expansively begins to tell him of his latest exploit in the air and after a minute or so, pauses, gives a quick glance around, and then continues bragging as before. In the middle of a sentence, he stops, looks puzzled, and says, "Somethin's cockeyed here. I saw your plane go down in flames over Brest. How'd you get out?" "I didn't," replies Nelson. The scene is utterly stupid but Tracy and his gradually growing awareness of his surroundings makes it hilarious.The second observation is that this was released in 1943, meaning it was probably written and shot in 1942. Well, this is a story about a loved one who was killed in the war, and how much we need to put our sorrow behind us and move on with our lives. And 1942 was a very bad year when it came to the good folks at home losing loved ones overseas, and the men and women overseas losing their best friends in combat. In a sense, this is a sort of documentary, a training film for civilians on how to handle the memory of people who were killed in action. Irene Dunne will never forget Tracy but, after a bit of rough handling by Tracy's friend, Ward Bond, she marries Johnson anyway. And if there are ghosts, they will understand and forgive us. They'd want us to get on with our lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guy Named Joe, A (1943) *** (out of 4) Well-acted drama has a hot shot pilot (Spencer Tracy) getting killed during a WW2 battle leaving his fiancé (Irene Dunne) all alone. The dead pilot eventually comes back as a ghost to help a young pilot (Van Johnson) but soon his morals come into question when the young man starts dating his fiancé. This here seems to remain a popular movie considering how many times Turner Classic Movies plays it a year. The same can't be said for the Steven Spielberg remake, Always, which seems to have already been forgotten as one of the director's minor works. This film here is certainly sappy and predictable but the wonderful cast makes it very entertaining to watch even though the running time is a tad bit long. Tracy leads the way with a very touching performance that lets the actor show off various emotions ranging from anger to sweetness to even some nice comic tones. Tracy was also great at playing the tough guy with a heart and this here is no exception. Dunne is good in her role but I was surprised to see how blandly written it was. She basically just sits around (or stands) waiting for one of the men to come up to her and considering how star level at the time it's rather shocking to see her role not juiced up a bit. Johnson steals the film as the new pilot who mirrors Tracy's character too much. The naive innocence Johnson brings to the role is quite memorable. Lionel Barrymore, James Gleason and Ward Bond all offer up nice support. Barry Nelson and Esther Williams have small roles as well. The are a few battle scenes, which look extremely well including the main battle at the middle of the film when Tracy gets killed. The aerial footage was well shot and manages to be quite dramatic as well. The cinematography is another plus as is the music score. Again, the main problem tends to be in the screenplay, which really doesn't allow for too many surprises and that includes the ending, which isn't believable and really comes off rather silly. The great cast makes it worth watching though.</fullReview>

Pete's girl Dorinda(Irene Dunne)knows that his "number" is up; and drama thickens as Pete doesn't make it back. Hollywood fantasy takes over as Pete's angel guards over young pilot Ted Randall(Van Johnson)in his training; even as he romances Dorinda, who still remains devoted to his memory.

		<fullReview>Spencer Tracy plays a World War II pilot who isn't just killed, but demolished, in the exciting opening of "A Guy Named Joe". He goes to a Heavenly place (with Lionel Barrymore in charge). There, he is given his Real Wings - he is to return to earth and be Van Johnson's "Guardian Angel". In the process, he has to deal with Mr. Johnson hooking up with his ex (Irene Dunne).The Victor Fleming-directed movie doesn't do anything to differentiate the ghostly Mr. Tracy from the Earthbound players. The story is propagandistic and illogical. But, the production looks nice, and some performances are worthy. ***** A Guy Named Joe (1943) Victor Fleming ~ Spencer Tracy, Irene Dunne, Van Johnson</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is an example of the World War II work of Dalton Trumbo, who wrote the screen play. Not many young people have seen this picture because it was pulled from the shelves when Trumbo - one of the "Hollywood Ten" - was blacklisted by the film industry for being publicly accused of being a "Communist" by Senator Joseph McCarthy during the Red Scare. It was updated and remade in 1989 by Steven Spielburg as the movie "Always", and "Always" is just as good as this film, if not better, which proves that Trumbo wrote a great story to begin with. The re-write replaces World War II Carpet Bombing with Rocky Mountain aerial fire fighting, and adds some very sound romance and bonding that really makes the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pathos-Filled Entertainment That Appeals to the Heightened Emotions of the Audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Guy Named Joe is a popcorn movie entertainment in the most classic sense. We are suckered by the maven charm of the inherently self-assured never-miss talent of Irene Dunne, the cocksure wiseguy swagger of Spencer Tracy, the brazen spectacle of the airborne war effort, a creative high-concept plot device and just the romanticism of the whole thing. Victor Fleming---hot off the helm of the two most celebrated and remembered films in American history, The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind, which he directed both in the same year---was proved a highly capable director to say the least, particularly within the vein of such idealistic Americana as A Guy Named Joe. He was like Mervyn LeRoy, who made greatly satisfying escapist pictures like Random Harvest, but Fleming was notorious for his uber-masculine edge, which comes to life here much more than in either of his 1939 epics. It is this treatment of his surrounding talents that is designed to excite the 1943 viewer.This drippy film uses premonitions, the afterlife and spiritual counseling to drive the story, and we tend to have some premonitions of our own in terms of cogitating the next step ahead after awhile. Legendary screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, though his script feels rushed to conclude, sketches characterizations that the actors bring to formidable life, and not just the two fiery leads but peripheral characters whose functions in the narrative formula are self-evident, like Ward Bond and Van Johnson. It is a lavishly verbose script as well, with positive and negative results. It is, nevertheless, a melodrama, but likewise, it is not entirely such a clearly constructed world of connotations: There is no unambiguous villain posing a threat, save the unseen dogfight opponents, but a humbling test for a wealthy heroic ego. The hero does not escape, nor does he rescue the heroine. He learns to accept the hand he's dealt and the heroine is a whole other character of her own with a quest of her own.A Guy Named Joe is still a pathos-filled tale that appeals to the heightened emotions of the audience, but done with a great deal of industry talent, and an implacable, abstract sense of wonder and novelty as a classic American studio picture. It makes me think of a strip of celluloid whirring from one reel to another between my fingertips.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Correction of Plane Type</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pete did NOT fly a bomber (B-25). His plane was a Lockheed P-38 Lightning, a FIGHTER plane, and one of the most advanced and successful fighters of WWII. Not only did it shoot down more Japanese aircraft than any American fighter, it was used by the two top American aces: Richard Bong and Tommy McGuire.The P-38 used in the movie (and the mock-ups) were early versions since they had the very sharply angled scoop on the engines. The plane was not perfect, as it suffered from "compressability" (the phenomenon of air passing too swiftly over the control surfaces and making it extremely difficult to pull out of a dive), AND its Allison engines were not as good as the Merlin/RRs used for the P-51 Mustang. Nevertheless, it was an excellent airplane, and its twin engines were greatly appreciated by its pilots, especially those in the South Pacific who flew over great expanses of ocean. Thus, to label this plane a "bomber" is not only grossly inaccurate, it fails to capture the attitude that all fighter pilots had during the war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Dunne It Wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I disagree vehemently (okay, I need a life to get that upset about a goofy movie) with the folks who rave about Irene Dunne's performance. Tracy is GREAT. Johnson is GREAT. But Dunne is totally miscast. When she's with Tracy you're thinking "Where is HEPBURN? She'd be much better in this part!" When she's with Johnson you're thinking "Dang, she looks like his mother. She's just the wrong type for him." I think...yes, and I hate myself for saying it...that Esther Williams, who just has a bit part would have been a better choice than Dunne. Most of the movie (except for the corny ending) is good. But when they cast Irene Dunne they Dunne it wrong!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood's depiction of death on screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite often, death scenes in movies seem -- for lack of a better word-- hokey. This practice is not limited to the early days of motion pictures (it continues into the present, especially in horror films). But watching A GUY NAMED JOE, namely that scene where Spencer Tracy learns he is either crazy or dead up in the clouds (you're not crazy, buddy), one can't help but wonder if this is how people thought the afterlife was in those days. Doesn't it seem contrived, uneducated and moronic, to an extent? Juvenile is the word that comes to mind.Where is the subject of death treated more accurately, or at least more believably, on celluloid? How about THE LAST ANGRY MAN (check out Paul Muni's spectacular deathbed scene); THE MCCONNELL STORY (where June Allyson's character witnesses the flying formation at the end that does not include Alan Ladd's deceased character); or GOOD-BYE MY LADY (which though it is unabashedly sentimental, seems to honestly convey the loss of a beloved pet).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The so-so original of a so-so remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a so-so film that was remade into the so-so Always. Just to make matters worse, there is no one named Joe. Spencer Tracy plays Pete, a WWII fighter pilot with a best friend and a girlfriend (the always irritating Irene Dunne). When Pete dies, he becomes a specialized guardian angel, training pilots from the beyond. Eventually, his trainee falls in love with his former girlfriend. The movie features an absolutely outstanding performance by Tracy -- even for Tracy, and some nice stuff about letting go. It also features some mixed patriotic/metaphysical preaching about war or honor or something that was so gobbledygooky I failed to understand it -- and I LIKE that sort of thing. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whose Joe??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Granted, I missed about 20 minutes of this movie, but I wish someone would PLEASE tell me who Joe was?Sure, from a factual standpoint, this movie was full of holes and idiocies... but for a basic premise it wasn't bad. Maybe that's why "Always" did it better? A guy who loves a girl but dies - then has to be the guardian angel to the girl's new guy... Spencer Tracey does the best he can in a movie that can't decide if it wants to be a drama or a comedy and settles for being neither very well.All actors do rather well with the difficult task of acting like they can't hear the person talking to them, yet somehow get what is being said. (Example: Irene Dunn mourning Spencer Tracey while he stands behind her telling her all the things he should have said while he could - perhaps the film's best moment.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We won the war despite films like this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was stationed in the Pacific during World War Two when I first saw this film. It was perhaps the most senseless of all the movies released at that time. The good thing is that it did not stop us from winning the war anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I just didn't like it very much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I want to stop all the rumors that I hate America and wanted Hitler to win the war. It's NOT true--it's just that I really didn't like this film. It just seemed silly and ridiculous. Here's the amazingly silly plot in a nutshell: Spencer Tracy is a hotshot pilot who loves Irene Dunne. The problem is, he crashes and becomes worm food--well at least that's what happens to his body. The angels apparently are good patriotic Hitler-haters, so they let Tracy come back as a ghost to help the war effort by letting him look over and secretly guide the actions of younger, more alive, pilots. Well, he is assigned to Van Johnson and prevents him from also assuming room temperature. BUT, in the process, Johnson now gets Dunne. Bummer.Okay, I know that many romance lovers out there might see this movie as a classic. It must be true because they recently remade this as the film ALWAYS. Well, given that I am a curmudgeon, I have yet to see ALWAYS and have no interest in doing so. The plot just annoys me. Okay folks, time to send me your hate mail, as I am probably one of the few reviewers that didn't really love the film. It only gets a 5 because I really like p-38s and other cool planes.And finally, I just thought of a really cool movie idea. Let's do the same movie. Then, let's switch to the Germans and show little dead guys working for the Devil helping their pilots! Now that would be really cool!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shot down by the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can see what `Upsetter' is talking about. A real pilot must have blanched at this hokum. It's not bad until the absurd ending. The idea that deceased ex-pilots are assigned to go along with their younger colleagues to whisper in their ear and give them a little divine inspiration might have been attractive to pilots or their loved ones. And the unusual dramatic triangle where Tracy has to guide Van Johnson through his difficult mission so he can get back to his girl and make her happy is a wonderful dramatic contrivance. But what actually happens at the end is a far worse contrivance and would have no credibility to anyone who knows anything about real war. The idea that dangerous bombing missions are run by single planes that drop a single load of bombs and practically win the war single-handedly by doing so brands the intended audience as idiots. Finally, the effects are cheesy enough for a Flash Gordon serial. Yeah, I know it was 1943 but take a look at the effects in the next Tracy/Johnson bomber pilot epic, `Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo', made just the next year to see how they could do it right in the old days. The director of that one must have had someone who knew what he was doing whispering in his ear on that one. Not so here, I'm afraid?</fullReview>
