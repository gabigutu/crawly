		<shortDescription>Why I love the film Always...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll just be honest here --- when I originally saw Always at the cinema in 1989, it was just a few months after my big brother passed away prematurely at the age of forty, and I'm not at all afraid to say that I cried like a baby. Like so many Americans, I have watched far too many films that i have taken to heart, but you know, Always is probably one of the final American films to ever really explore and display such deep human issues as unconditional love, mortality, and what a hero really is -- and isn't. It may be mushy, romantic, and a bit flawed, but I am proud that Spielberg made this bitter-sweet film -- I just saw it again and, if anything, it comes across as even more humane and honest in today's America of aggression, greed, and "relative" truth. If you've ever really, honestly, been so in love and committed to someone that you were willing to unconditionally put their needs before you own, or if you've ever lost anyone who meant the world to you, check it out. It changed my life when I first saw it because it made consider death in a new light... and it is about to totally change my life again as I have decided to live every moment for the rest of it as honest and decent and true to myself as possible --something that few of us today are willing to admit is lacking in our lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you have ever had a loss, this is the one for you!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I lost my husband suddenly about 2 years ago. I first watched this movie about 10 years ago and I enjoyed it. Then, I watched it last night again. This time, it was much more personal to me, and I still enjoyed it,only in a different way. The relationship between Holly Hunter and Richard Dreyfuss was portrayed wonderfully. The selfishness he felt when seeing her and Ted together for the first time was so very honest and painful. The pain she feels at moving on with her life, the love and concern John Goodman shows her, the uncertainty of her future and the way she will handle it kept me on the edge of my seat. The emotions were so real and many of them were the same ones I have felt over the past 2 years. The scene where Dorinda dances alone yet with Pete simply sent me to the tissues. When she is putting out that last fire, and is contemplating the rest of her life alone hit home as well. I cried for almost the entire movie this time. The actors portrayed their characters as real as can be, and I truly felt their pain and confusion. I read the book years ago and I feel that this is one of the few times the movie is as good as the book. This time after watching it, I actually was able to find a little peace in my life situation. If you have ever suffered a major loss in your life, I wholeheartedly recommend this movie- even if you haven't, the acting, the script and the movie as a whole gets a 9.0 in my book.

		<fullReview>Spielberg deserves a fresh look. I open with that because as I read the decidedly mixed thoughts on this and other films of his, I notice the same thought over and over again. People who review Spielberg usually want to pigeonhole him into a type: the ET-warm-and-fuzzy-alien children's storyteller versus the special-effects-heavy-but-rather-empty-plot dreamer. All the while there is the generic whine of 'why doesn't he ever try to do something else (SCHINDLER'S LIST notwithstanding)?' Then when he does, as evidenced here, there are wails of dissatisfaction that he tried to do something over his head. Oy.It's so silly to label and categorize a filmmaker so much. ALWAYS is, first and foremost, a love story. A remake of an earlier film to be sure, but even this 1989 treatment looks and feels nostalgic with its amber-tinted cinematography, the sentimental presentation of the devoted fighter pilots, even Holly Hunter's birthday gift of 'girl clothes' tips a hat to 1940's elegance. And you can't get more nostalgic than the appearance of the ageless, magical Audrey Hepburn (sharp as a tack in her last film as a bright-eyed, no-nonsense angel). All of Hepburn's scenes with Richard Dreyfuss are wonderful (especially the first one when she tries- slightly befuddled- to explain his state of existence), as is the leitmotiv of "Smoke Gets In Your Eyes-" used in two dance sequences with Dreyfuss and Hunter: one at a charming birthday party (watching all the burly firemen clean up is a riot), the other in a bewitching soliloquy of mourning. And once again, John Goodman rises to the occasion as the best friend anyone could ever have. Just saw it on TCM, rounding out a July 2005 tribute to Ms. Hepburn. You should check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film worth revisiting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been a while since I have seen this 'Always.' The years, I should say, have done this film justice.A noted cinephile, I know when to eat my words, and this is one is for the books. Sincere. Honest. Touching. Obviously sparked with a late-eighties, Spielbergian hyper-real, cinematic extensions and flair, these elements do not bog the film downs as, say, with '1941' or 'The Color Purple.' And why should we expect modern filmmakers to be like those of the forties or fifties? Modern filmmakers are just that -- modern. Holly Hunter is a walking dream and she has talent in droves. I have long had a crush on her and her funny mouth. She is simply enchanting and steals the show. Goodman, for once, is kept under control. Dreyfuss, with the thankless role of revisiting his past and commenting on the future, is the weakest link but only just. Sumptuously photographed by deftly edited, this story of unrequited love is as universal as mothers and babies. If it doesn't bring tears to your eyes, shame on you. The best advice to view this film is to forget it is a Spielberg film. Enjoy it for the love story that it is and sink into its voluptuous and charged charm.We should all hope we become angels in the mist, able to return to Earth to right all the wrongs of the world.This may be one Spielberg's most romantic films, next to A.I., which is a supremely magnificent film and, also, equally dismissed when it first arrived on the scene.I urge all to give this film a second chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartfelt and touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Ebert made the colossal blunder of calling this unceremoniously trashed 1989 romantic drama "Spielberg's weakest since '1941'". Spielberg hadn't made HOOK yet. And make no mistake about it, this was unceremoniously trashed (just as A.I. is being unceremoniously trashed).ALWAYS is in essence a reworking (rather than an outright remake) of the 1943 Victor Fleming classic A GUY NAMED JOE. Richard Dreyfuss, Spielberg's favorite Everyman, is the fire-fighting pilot who is great at putting out fires but has this horrible penchant for taking unnecessary chances in the air. Even his best friend (John Goodman) thinks he's overdoing it; and now, his one true love (Holly Hunter) has come down hard on him, basically saying "Enough is enough." Dreyfuss, scared of all this, agrees to change his ways and settle down. But on his last firefighting mission, after having saved Goodman when the engine of Goodman's plane catches fire, Dreyfuss' plane blows up, killing him instantly.In heaven (or a burned-out forest, take your pick), Dreyfuss is met by his guardian angel Hap (Audrey Hepburn, a final fitting performance), who tells him that, yes, he is to go back and to give much inspiration to a future aerial firefighter...but that's only part of it. The problem is, of course, what Hepburn didn't tell him the first time around.Dreyfuss gives inspiration and (often witty and hilarious) guidance to this rookie flyer (Brad Johnson). After a few false starts, including the hideously funny "dump-all-over-Al (Goodman)" sequence, Johnson begins to learn the ropes. But then, Johnson begins to fall in love with Hunter. And it is there that we realize that Dreyfuss can still feel pain, even though he's dead. Hepburn understands his pain, and says that he still has to settle with Hunter. Until he does that, not only won't Hunter be free of her pain, but Dreyfuss won't be free of his. The moment of truth comes in the climax, a terrifying flight by Hunter through the flames of a mountain firestorm in which Dreyfuss has to safely guide her out. The coda is one of the more heartfelt and touching sequences in history.So many complained that this feels like a 1940s film with 1980s/1990s new age mysticism. In a certain way, it does. But ALWAYS worked for me because of its incredible emotional sensitivity. Dreyfuss, Hunter, and Goodman are really great in this film, as is Hepburn in her final role. John Williams' great score is the icing on the cake, and the use of "Smoke Gets In Your Eyes" as the film's love theme is also appropriate.ALWAYS is nowhere near being the bad film Roger Ebert and others made it out to be. Next to A.I., I think it is the most misunderstood film Spielberg has ever made. It's a real touching film, worth seeing again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A graceful swan song for Audrey Hepburn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance, Always looks like a variation of Ghost, until one realizes it is a remake of a much older movie. But it has something Ghost certainly did not have -- Audrey Hepburn.In what would be her final big-screen appearance, Audrey is radiant as the angel Hap, who appears all too briefly in the film. From the moment her famous voice is heard, time seems to stop. True, Audrey doesn't have a lot to say -- although her Doctor Who-like non-explanation about time is funny -- the few moments she is on screen are minutes to treasure. If Judi Dench and Ingrid Bergman were able to get Oscars for glorified cameos, it's a shame Hepburn didn't rate a nomination. Of course, much of what's special about Audrey's role in this film comes from hindsight -- the fact she only had a couple more years to live, and the fact she had only appeared a few times on film in the previous 20 years. But we can be thankful to Steven Spielberg for not only getting Audrey to make the appearance, but also for giving her a classy film in which to make her swan song.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Positive review of movie, comparing and contrasting to Ghost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a quality film, and it is one of the reasons why I think John Goodman is a really a good actor who often goes unnoticed. This movie would have been decent with any cast, but I think the combination of John Goodman, Holly Hunter, and Richard Dreyfuss really brought the story to life. Additionally Spielberg does a good job of incorporating the supernatural presence of Pete Sandich's ghost without relying on dramatic special effects. This movie is somewhat similar in theme to Ghost (which came out one year after Always), but Ghost focuses more on the supernatural aspects and goes to great lengths to show the ghost walking through doors and other objects. To a certain extent these special effects take center stage in ghost, whereas in Always you never see Richard Dreyfuss walk through anything. All of the cool supernatural stuff happens offscreen leaving the plot and the characters as the main focal point. That being said I think that the action scenes with the planes flying over the forest fires are really thrilling. It's beautiful, and intense. (I think it makes the dogfights in Top Gun look like a Carousel ride) Go rent this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still moves me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just seen a re-cap of AFI's 100 most romantic films, I decided to go through my own video library to see how many I owned. Of course, starting alphabetically, I pulled out "Always". It wasn't on AFI's list. But it is on mine. I threw it in the VCR, having seen it at least 3-4 times before, and it was like watching it for the first time again.To sum it up, I wept, from the opening to the closing scene. Rarely am I so touched by a film that it affects me so strongly as to push aside all rational thought and open up the flood gates. But I should expect no less from the man (Spielberg) who single-handedly keeps the tissue industry in the black. He knows how to tug those heart-strings. He's doesn't just play off one emotion; he goes for them all! Drama, action, humor, loss and love. And what he does in "Always", just like "Empire of the Sun", "The Color Purple", "E.T.", "Schindler's List", and "Saving Private Ryan"; is never let the rider off the coaster.Unfortunately, at the release of "Always", he had not fully gained the respect of the industry enough to prevent this film from being pushed aside. For me, however, it's still right there up on top!Kudos Spielberg , for reminding us that even your less-seen films were done w/ brilliance, integrity, humor and a more than just a few tears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Spielberg always</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unexpected film from the director who made his name with box office hits like ET, The Jaws (to say nothing of Indiana Johnes series). Always comes from this period between all these kids' stories and a new wave of escapist fantasies about dinosaurs. When a kid I loathed this film because I did not understand it at all and was a big action ?special effects movies fan. Time changes a lot. I learned to appreciate this magnificent picture and it is one of its biggest secrets at the same time. I love this movie but can not clearly explain why, there are lots of films which appear to me to be much more interesting, lots of film which appear to me to be much more intellectual but still I can not help loving this simple low budget love/friendship story. I just want to tell you about some scenes from Always which are my personal favorites:1.The fire pilot club scene when Pete "remembered Dorinda's birthday wrong", He says:"Why do not we try signaling to the band, it works in the movies" and then everyone present wants to dance with Dorinda while Pete is watching the whole affair from upstairs. It is so?..so perfect. 2.Hepburn ? Dreyfull dialogue in the field with her telling him about Spiritus "something they get when they need it most".3. Dorinda and Ted dining with Dorinda dancing to Platters tune. Words fail to describe it.4 The final scene in the aircraft, and these Pete's last words:"You are going to have wonderful life". JohnWilliams' score is awesome, especially the closing titles theme-a sound of a lonely piano echoing?. Away with the pretences this film weights 8 on my great movies scales because it moves me, inspires me and I keep 9 and 10 only for all time classic like Bergman's Virgin Spring or Griffith's Intolerance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of his lesser films, Always is a nice, touching story that seems to never have found its proper audience. Wonderfully shot, well acted, the 1989 film is a departure from Spielberg's usual fantasy and historical pictures but has echoes of both. The firebomber sequences hint at some of the battle scenes from Saving Private Ryan years down the road. Well worth checking out if you haven't seen it. Hepburn's final screen appearance is gentle and touching. Spielberg is restrained in this film. Perhaps he considers it a small film, but it is a forgotten gem in many ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsatisfying, but only by Spielberg's standards. Rent 'Ghost' instead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Dreyfuss plays a reckless pilot who tells his girlfriend she'll never get over him, dies early on in the film, and is then given a kind-of mission by Hep (an incredible-looking 60-year old Audrey Hepburn) to do an unselfish act. Spielberg has the gift to draw you in, but on a scale of Spielberg to Home Video, 'Always' disappoints. There is something unsatisfying about it - we're used to such entertainment from Spielberg, that when he delivers us an intimate, personal film about grief, it can't help but seem lacking. It is uneven and flawed - mainly because it is shallow and naive. In so many places it compromises its intimacy in order to lighten the mood: the bawdy jokes in the first ten minutes, the supernaturalism. Then there is the nauseating screen presence of Richard Dreyfuss, who tries to balance the sentimentalism of the material but ends up looking obnoxious. First prize for the worst laugh in cinema history. Rent 'Ghost' (1990) instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Ten is for Penicillin, Democracy, and this Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film deviates from your typical Steven Spielberg movie. Intricate technological gimmickry was supplanted with a largess of spellbinding emotions that the movie "Always" implemented so astutely; as a result, the film, "Always" struck a very sensitively artistic nerve cord!! The focal song to this picture, "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" is seemingly appropriate with the genre of this film, and, the acting is spectacular!! Holly Hunter, Richard Dreyfuss, Brad Johnson, and John Goodman establish a cohesiveness in this movie that perpetuates a heartfelt empathy which is pertinent to the idealistic notions for which people perceive about the unexplained!! The kinetic energy, which is absolutely ubiquitous in the film "Always", induces the movie audience to construe the physical absence of Richard Dreyfuss' character as something which signifies a necessary spiritual guidance throughout the duration of the film!! In evaluating this movie, it does a remarkable job of making you feel fortunate for all of the wonderful things that have happened in your life!! The close knit camaraderie with every one of Hunter's and Dreyfuss' fellow workers, has an auspiciously enticing disposition for the delicately diligent procurement of this Spielberg masterpiece!!! The year, 1989, was one of my favorite years, thus making it easy for me to identify with the positive emotions that this movie has depicted! Understanding the gist of what a relationship has to offer is a critical component to making that relationship last!! My association with this movie is very positive; the emotional gratification to the film "Always", homogenizes directorial, and acting genius, such an aggregate wealth of talent, makes "Always" an incredibly fantastic movie!! I definitely recommend seeing this movie!! The cerebral comprehension to the film "Always" goes that extra mile, that is why this film is so amazing!! "Always" is, without question, a Steven Spielberg caliber flick, there are no two ways about that estimation whatsoever!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie with my wife when it came out in 1989 in a small theater on a rainy night. We had just been married weeks before and in many ways still getting to know one another. We had no idea what this movie would mean to us as we knew very little about it before seeing it. I've "always" been a fan of both Dreyfuss and Hunter. He's just magnificent and she's just completely adorable. This movie hit me like a ton of bricks. I'm not one to show emotion during movies. You know what I mean guys...sneak a little tear wipe here and there. Well when we got back to the car and sat for a moment in the pouring rain before I started the car, the waterworks flowed like Niagra and we could not stop crying. All the pent up emotion of the movie came pouring out of us both and it's still one of the most touching moments we've ever spent together. This movie will have a similar effect on you if you're at all in touch with your emotions. Kudos to Spielberg for showing us his range and kudos to the cast for a great set of performances. A great example of how amazing a movie can be without tons of smoke and mirrors. This one should be in every collector's DVD rack. Even if you're not a collector of DVD's, rent it with your significant other and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My husband asked me to marry him after we saw this movie. He was a helicopter pilot and we had met at an air show. We both loved vintage aircraft so this seemed to be just the movie to see. We both laughed and cried so hard during the movie. Little was I to know that 13 years later I would lose my husband while he was flying. It took me some years to watch this movie again and I too cried through the whole thing. It is so personal to me. There are times when I feel, like Holly did, that I can hear my husband talking to me and guiding me. There is a lot to be learned from this picture about life and love.

		<fullReview>I've loved this film for 25 years (it celebrates it's 25th Anniversary) how time flies! (sorry couldn't resist)This film works or fails on it's 4 main characters...and god are they good!Richard Dreyfuss is an American Acting Legend who deserves more credit and his paring with Holly Hunter might NOT have been many people's first choice as a romantic pairing but boy does it work, she's a pocket rocket firecracker and he is at his most handsome ever!Then there's John Goodman as his good friend 'Al' another terrific performance and Brad Johnson as Ted Baker, without these two actors and characters working it might just have fell flat (in fact it soars, sorry I must stop this!)Audrey Hepburn (Hap) gets a magical, beautiful, final movie cameo (THANKS Steven) and she is PITCH PERFECT."YOUR A GOOD MAN PETE...WE DON'T SEND BACK THE OTHER KIND"The Beginning of the film is TERRIFIC...and sets everything up (he's reckless, she's scared to death, Al is the joker in the middle) it is a film brilliantly directed by Mr Spielberg, beautifully photographed with colours and lighting that will stay with you.The first time you see Dorinda (Holly Hunter) in THAT dress!!! well if your a guy you'll want that dance too...that is some dress and this is some woman!Events happen and not soon after Pete is observing, in one scene he sees a guy brushing away the dust and in a light hearted way smiles and says "I think your a funny looking guy", a few seconds pass and this guy is then seen looking into the cars mirror and sadness falls upon his face, yup Pete realises he has the power of suggestion over people (but the power of love? well that's hard to control)"GIVE HIM A CHANCE AL"That's a line Pete would regret (at least for a short time)The old guy (that can hear Pete) you'll know from "HOME ALONE"When Pete says "GOD I WISH WE'D HAVE MET SOONER" to Dorinda many of you like me will be thinking the very same....I never did meet my Dorinda so if you meet yours 'Hang on Tight'Now I'm a guy that loves ACTION, SCI-FI, HORROR and ADVENTURE FILMS but if a films a good 'un then it's good one no matter what genre and this is so GOOD. Maybe I'm getting older but there are numerous times throughout this film that get the tears flowing...THE TALK between Pete and Dorinda at night especially when Pete tells her what's going to happen.DORINDA WALKING AWAY from the PLANE...not knowing what Pete is saying to her and she kind of knowing what was about to happen...she knows!AL visiting DORINDA in her apartment on the edge of a runway.And finally...THE PLANE TALK FINALE (watch Holly's eyes!!! this is some acting! and how she does not tear before is truly incredible!)If you are not trying to hold it together at these points well I just don't know!This is an amusing, thrilling, funny, heartbreaking and wonderful feel-good movie with so many good moments, many trash it because of Mr Spielberg's name attached (shame on them)Having read so many reviews here I was especially taken by two, one whom had lost her pilot husband and another who had lost her brother, my heart goes out to them but it just shows the power of film.Scores as low as 2 and 3!!! these folks have no idea! Overall rating of 6.4!!! OK I guess the people have spoken and that's the true reflection but I disagree with this strongly.A STEVEN SPIELBERG Gem that sadly is forgotten but is ready to be re-discovered.Romantic Love movies don't come much better than thisTHIS FILM WILL LIFT THE HEART IF YOU ALLOW IT.UPDATE: It was a delight to recently see Mr Spielberg (yup someone whose movies I have grown up with and is my favourite director) on Film 2015 and upon being asked which film he thought of his was perhaps underrated he mentioned "ALWAYS" YES!!! my gosh he's NOT WRONG, to my eyes it's a CLASSIC, BEAUTIFUL Movie and i'll thank him for this forever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only heard of this film because it was mentioned in an episode of South Park, but I guess that's the joke, it is one of the less known films directed by Steven Spielberg. Basically Pete Sandich (Richard Dreyfuss) is a daredevil aerial forest firefighter, with best pal Al Yackey (John Goodman), with true love Dorinda Durston (Holly Hunter) by his side, as radio controller. He takes a lot of risks, and one day a risk doesn't pay off and he is killed, but he finds himself coming back an an invisible ghost. He cannot be seen or heard, and he has to watch as Dorinda and his successor Ted Baker (Brad Johnson) start falling for each other. His "spirit guide" (or whatever she is) Hap (Audrey Hepburn, in her last screen role) tells him that he will be freed and able to go when he allows himself to let her go and say goodbye, so when he eventually does, all the women will probably want their handkerchiefs. Also starring Roberts Blossom as Dave, Keith David as Powerhouse, Marg Helgenberger as Rachel and Brian Haley as Alex. I have to say the concept of this film reminded me of Ghost, which was made a year after this, but this film doesn't quite have the same quality for story-telling. But the performances by Dreyfuss, Hunter, and a scene-stealing Goodman (that dance scene being a highlight) are all good, so it's not bad. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disclaimer: At time of writing this is the only review I have done where I did not see the original version prior to watching the remake. However, given the extraordinary pedigree (in no particular order, Spielberg behind the camera, and Hepburn, Dreyfuss, Goodman and Hunter in front) I decided to grab the old typewriter (keyboard) and dive in anyway. First the direction. Spielberg would rather have a root canal than leave behind to posterity any scene that is not perfectly lit and shot. So that's a non-issue. Hepburn? OMG what can I add that has not been said by the other reviewers? One of kind star presence. Five minutes of screen time with this lady is equal to two hours with any so-called modern actress. As for Dreyfuss, Hunter and Goodman what I really like about them is that not only do they do what is required, but they are relatively underexposed for the talent they deliver, and Spielberg kept each on a tight leash. (To see what happens when you don't keep these guys on a tight leash, watch Dreyfuss in Duddy Kravitz, Hunter in Saving Grace, and Goodman in just about anything he has ever done). As for final impact, I will say that the story is perhaps not for everyone and does take some time to build. But the payoff is there, and the reality of life and death is not going to change much over your lifetime, so, when you are ready to face either or both, this film will still be available for your viewing pleasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's Mid-Life Crisis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the 1970's, Steven Spielberg and Richard Dreyfuss made a great team. The intense little actor played a likable shark expert in JAWS and a suburban alien-obsessed dad in CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND. And ten years later, they attempt to rekindle that magic. And although there's some good use of The Spielberg Touch? flowing camera-work weaving in and out of glorious special effects? this is a romance that tries too hard to pull heartstrings.Dreyfuss and sidekick John Goodman are firefighting pilots with a dangerous job. Dreyfuss is a daredevil who, with each venture, risks his life more than necessary. The first thirty minutes consists of Holly Hunter, Dreyfus's girlfriend who works ground control, and Goodman trying to tell their friend he's taking too many chances. But this occurs between sappy dialog and the building of a relationship that wasn't very special to begin with.That is, until Dreyfus is killed and, while wandering around a earth-based purgatory, New Age angel Audrey Hepburn gives him an afterlife mission: to help a handsome young pilot, Brad Johnson, earn his wings. But Johnson's true aim is to win over Holly Hunter ? turning an interesting twist into a wasted subplot.Dreyfuss, as a ghost, seems more like a creepy stalker, placing thoughts into people's minds to maneuver their choices ? especially Hunter, who he won't let go of. Meanwhile, he reluctantly helps Johnson? who unsuccessfully balances a suave yet dorky character? become a great pilot.Holly Hunter, while being a cute, spunky actress, is miscast as an ingénue every man desires. Goodman does his usual fat funny guy, but to an annoying level ? he and everyone else seem to be playing for opening night audiences. And Dreyfus goes so overboard with forced sentimentality you'll wish the shark had got him or that those aliens never brought him home.The Ariel shots, while filmed beautifully (especially the pivotal death scene), are simply used as breaks from an overlong Hallmark Card. And Steven Spielberg would thankfully end his creative mid-life crisis with HOOK and get back to business at hand.And More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Weaker Spielberg Film Saved By Holly Hunter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Dreyfuss plays one of a unit of aerial firefighters, dropping fire retardant to extinguish forest fires. He and Holly Hunter, a dispatcher, are deeply in love. Following another of Dreyfuss's pointlessly dicey flying stunts, the pilots, mechanics and firemen are lounge at the saloon. Dreyfuss catches Hunter unawares with a white dress for her birthday, even if it's not the right day. She puts on the dress anyway and all the guys rush to wash their hands so they get a turn dancing with her to a cover of Smoke Gets In Your Eyes that is no comparison to the old version sung by the wonderful Irene Dunne, the co-star of the original film on which this movie is based.While on a bombing run, Dreyfuss's engine catches fire and doesn't make it. The next thing he knows, he is in a scenic forest with an angel played by Audrey Hepburn in her final screen role, who explains in her signature gentle manner that he is going to be a muse to others. That, which to a degree seems promising, prepares us for the second half of the movie, in which poor Dreyfuss has to return to earth and be an imperceptible muse for the dull and boring youngster who has taken his place. And he has to watch, powerlessly, as the kid and Hunter fall in love. Dreyfuss is takes this much too lightly for us to feel the true extent of the tragedy that exists in this material.One of the weaknesses of lesser Spielberg effort is that it is one thing to sacrifice your life for a buddy in combat and quite another to run unnecessary risks while fighting forest fires, which are proved to actually be natural anyway. Another hindrance seems to stem from Spielberg's love of mighty special effects. The airplanes in this film appear to crash and slam their way through acres of scorching woods. Wouldn't a impact with only one of these trees cause a plane to crash? Because the seemingly heroic firefighters cut through the wood like it's nothing. The effects are so stunning that they're implausible.The single upholding grace of the movie is Holly Hunter, conveying real and gushingly emotional pressure and stubborn impulsiveness. She has a straightforward style that is so much stronger than the cornball audacity and unflustered cool of Dreyfuss and Goodman. The scenes in which Dreyfuss is an angel watching while Hunter and Brad Johnson fall in love are the most out of depth in the film. Dreyfuss throws out jokey lines when perhaps a wounded gaze or a quiet turning of his back would have been more real and affecting, but we see no indignance and that is what is needed.The film's most peculiar attribute, considering the fact that it was made by the director of The Color Purple and Empire of the Sun in the same decade, is a deficit of stress. Albeit pilots are flying into engulfing flames and we are in suspense hoping they came out on the other side, they have a lack of concern, a casual manner, that undercuts the emotion promised by Hunter's intensely persuasive depiction of raw love for Dreyfuss. The air of the film is a 1940s impression, which is surely what Spielberg was wanting, but I'm not certain it succeeds as expected. In an attempt to create a dated feel for the dialogue, very much of it sounds scripted instead of spoken. The result is a remake with less than effective anachronisms, thus no reason to remake it save for the fact that the director loves it so much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pete is a hotshot pilot who flies water-bomber planes to put out forest fires, and is madly in love with his feisty girl, Dorinda. When he dies in a fireball, his spirit is sent back to Earth to inspire another pilot, but also to let go of the love he could never truly express.This film, a loose remake of a great old black-and-white movie called A Guy Named Joe, is one of my favourite love stories, and I'm the first to admit I don't like many of them. Too often I find they have sappy characters, heavily contrived plots, no action, and not very much of anything to say. This film however has sharp, funny, disarming characters, a simple but gripping storyline, thrills galore (the flying / forest fire sequences are sensational) and is a profound study of grief, loss and redemption. Spielberg astutely tones down his technical genius and focuses almost entirely on character; Pete's ghostly qualities are played entirely without special effects until the final shot, and the depth of his love, frustration and pain is explored to its full dramatic impact. Dreyfuss is simply wonderful in this film, made twelve years after his great collaboration with Spielberg on Close Encounters Of The Third Kind. He is shrewd, funny, aloof and tender - he has a terrific affinity for playing distanced, thoughtful and yet warm-hearted characters (see also Stand By Me and Moon Over Parador) and delivers a mature, rich, beautifully-measured performance. Hunter sparks off him with fabulous energy, Johnson is a lovable side of beef, Goodman a stalwart comic-dramatic foil, Hepburn is memorable (in her final role) as the enigmatic angel Hap, and Helgenberger, David and Blossom (another alumni from Close Encounters) all shine in bit parts. The movie has a lovely ethos to it - that the departed stand behind us and occasionally share their wisdom subconsciously - and although it's a simple ghost story romance, it really explores what it means to lose someone dear. It's extremely well made, with many memorable shots (my favourite is the one of Dreyfuss standing at the fridge - a ghost before he's a ghost), great optical effects and several lengthy sequences that just build and build (the dancehall party, Pete's death, the schoolbus scene, Dorinda's date with Ted, Pete and Dorinda's night flight). One of the many things I admire about Spielberg is his rare talent to move between films of different genres and styles almost effortlessly. This is his one out-and-out conventional romantic movie (ET is a love story, but between a boy and an alien), and it's magical, heartfelt, beautifully played and tremendously entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A thoroughly excellent Film. The flying sequences are a pleasure to watch, the filming of them appears to be so easy, belying the difficulty of co-ordinating aircraft of dissimilar performances, including the camera aircraft. The fire fighting scenes have me 'pulling up' for them! The characters in the film are people that you would care about if you knew them personally, and by the end you feel that you do. There is no 'nastiness' in any part of the movie, the characters are well rounded human beings with their own faults and strengths. My three daughters, 4, 7 &amp; 11 enjoy the film, and have watched it quite often on DVD.</fullReview>

Dreyfuss has you crying along with him, and sharing his pain as he struggles to give up his love, while Hunter captures your eye almost immediately. While John Goodman beats Hunter verbally for giving up on herself, you really struggle between anger and sympathy.There's not a single flaw in this film. The cinematography is stunning, with the lighting bringing every scene alive. I couldn't help but be drawn into this story, and really feeling for the characters.The whole story is steeped in big life morals, but not in the usual in-your-face way. It's a story of accepting life and death, letting go, and above all, saying what you feel before it's too late.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fellini had And The Ship Sails On. Hitchcock had Frenzy. Spielberg has Always. I'm sorry but dumping big vats of red stuff on forest fires, practice ones or real ones, does not dramatically equal dropping bombs on Nazi enemies. The vaguely 40's-esque dialog and attitude throughout don't help. Even the performances aren't tip-top: they all seem to know they're in a movie--you can feel the craft service table just outside the frame. But it's Spielberg, which means there's a restless and brilliant imagination at work in every shot, so if you go in knowing the great man dropped the ball on this one, there will be something here to enjoy. And then you can rent Saving Private Ryan or Amistad (underrated and masterful) and get back on the boat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A lot of the films I've made probably could have worked just as well 50 years ago, but that's just because I have a lot of old-fashion values." - Steven SpielbergA loose remake of "A Guy Named Joe", Steven Spielberg's "Always" finds Richard Dreyfuss and Holly Hunter playing a couple of lovers torn apart by death. An attempt by Spielberg to emulate Frank Capra, the film's also heavily influenced by Powell and Pressburger's "A Matter of Life and Death" and, to a lesser extent, Wim Wenders' "Wings of Desire"."Always" was bashed by critics upon release, many stating that the film's elaborate action sequences detracted from its central romance. But the truth is probably also the opposite: "Always" needs a lot more noise and special effects to distract us from the fact that Spielberg can't film any line of dialogue that doesn't end in an exclamation point. His second feature-length foray into the world of comedy, "Always" is mostly unfunny. Spielberg's idea of humour is 1950s screwballs and early Looney Tunes cartoons, a style for which he personally has no gift. The film's surprisingly heavy-handed, every emotion overplayed, every joke over designed, every sequence filled with unnecessary business. And as he's unable to handle human beings, and certainly not intimacy, the film's central romance is awkward. Holly and Dreyfuss come across as brother and sister rather than lovers, she a wisecracking tomboy, he a wisecracking old-man. Spielberg's repeatedly stated that he considers himself different from the other brat pack directors of the 1970s, in that he is an "optimist" and "humanist". But he's probably the biggest sadist of all these directors, the very form of his films often undermining their supposed intentions, their very box office performances always proportionate to their dazzling displays of carnage. The failure of Spielberg to connect with any of the characters in "Always", and the relish he shows, instead, for filming forest fires, air-planes crashing etc, perfectly encapsulates the rest of his filmography. People running from dinosaurs, sharks, Nazis, tripods, bullets, genocide, rocks etc...this is what Spielberg delights in. The moment his characters stop to speak, however, everything self-destructs. A film like "Amistad" failed with audiences, in other words, because not enough blacks died and too many whites talked.In many ways, Spielberg's box-office "flops" are more illuminating than his more "successful" films. They reveal the steel skeleton beneath the technique. They show what the amusement park looks like when its not working, revealing the vacuum beneath the machinery. Indeed, it was "flops" like "Always" and "Hook" which taught Spielberg how to con audiences. After a series of colourful, gooey films, Spielberg dumped the gooey cinematography of "Color Purple" and "Empire of the Sun" in favour for the more desaturated "black and white" worlds of "Schindler's List", "Munich", "Private Ryan" and "Minority Report". From here on, "less light", "dark cinematography" and pops of violence became equated with "serious topics". Ironically, after the financial success of each "dark film", Spielberg reverts back to his rosy cinematography (and a brazenly sentimental tone), and falls flat on his face once again. These "colour" films ("Always", "Hook", "War Horse" etc) are always bashed for being too tacky, sentimental, corny and hokey, but his "serious" films are the same, their kitsch is just hidden by noise and desaturation.4/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is why Spielberg is the greatest of all!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cast was fabulous. This was Audrey Hepburn's last appearance on the big screen as well, in a role as "Hap", the angel who Pete (Richard Dreyfuss) first encounters after dying from his plane exploding. Holly Hunter shines as Dorinda, Pete's girlfriend, who tries to come to terms with Pete dying. John Goodman is also funny and lovable as Al, one of the pilot trainers. Steven Spielberg's tale of love defying death is a good premise for a story and he does very well. Richard Dreyfus plays the fire pilot who dies trying to save some forest fire men who are trapped by a large blaze. He is recruited by Audrey Hepburn to return to earth and act as a guardian angel/trainer for another young pilot. Little does he know, that he is also there to help his girlfriend (Holly Hunter) and friend (John Goodman) come to terms with his sudden death and move on with their lives. Some good performances from the main players and a joy to see Hepburn on the big screen again in this small cameo.There's a lot of room for emotional moments in this film, so don't forget the tissues. I love the whole idea of the film. It's great to watch Richard Dreyfuss weave his magic with a touching script. And John Goodman is the perfect buddy for, first Pete and then Dorina. In the end we have to forgive Ted for wanting to take Pete's girl. It is hard because we can see Pete is still desperately in love with her. But when he turns the corner and starts pulling for Ted, we can't help but follow. A good solid movie that will leave you with a smile, if not some tears, on your face.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film on Netflix recently and i hadn't seen it in years. In fact I had not seen it since my dad died three years ago in my arms, and it just blew me away, to the point where i could not stop the tears from flowing the entire film. I loved it back when i first saw it many years ago, and it still resonates for me to this day. Why is it so wonderful? Honest, simple filmmaking, an uncomplicated plot, believable actors, and a great but believable story. This is Spielberg before the Jurassic monster he created, and although he made many films before this, this for me was him at his best. Holly Hunter, Richard Dreyfuss, and John Goodman were just so ideal in their roles, and without trying to sound overtly intellectual and snobbish, it's just a beautiful film, and if you love storytelling at its' best, give this a chance. What saddens me about this film and this site is the low rating, especially compared to ALL those "masterpieces" that Tarantino vomits forth. Its a sad world we live in when this is only in the low 6s and dreck like Pulp Fiction, Django Unchained, and whatever else he creates are considered to be such great films, and then a touching, lovely and heartbreaking film like this is overlooked. Please watch this film if you already haven't, and give it the rating and love it so richly deserves. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Always brings me back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time I see the title Always in our DVD case I'm tempted to pull it out and watch it again, for perhaps the 10th time. This isn't normally something I's want to watch because it shows the lead character influencing and being around in spirit after his death. But there's something about this project that give is a warm part in my mind.I guess it's primarily the love story between Pete and Dorinda. But it's so much more than that. It's the light-heartedness, the humor, the tragedy, and filled with characters I'd be glad to call my friends.Personally I've never found that Spielberg knows how to portray love, but this film was an exception. He got it right. There is a depth to this story that lingers.I wouldn't have rated this 8/10 years ago, but it is that sense that it keeps drawing me back that makes me admit that I like it that much. I like Dryfus but he seems to be an actor without much breadth. However this may be his best movie.Holly Hunter is not only easy on the eyes but the way she speaks, with that slightly off normal voice, is very endearing. She is a terrific actress.Goodman doesn't seem like an actor, which is meant as a huge complement. He fills each part so well it doesn't seem like he's acting. Perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my all time favorite movies, reinforcing the maxim that everything starts with a good story. "Always" has all the best elements working together. It is a great story, with superb casting, top-shelf acting, and it touches the heart. It combines humor, heartache, adventure, tragedy, relationships, love, life and death into classic entertainment for young and old. Way to go, Mr. Spielberg. Having said that, don't be surprised that the original screenplay which "Always" is based upon was a World War II story written in 1943 by Dalton Trumbo, entitled "A Guy Named Joe," starring Spencer Tracy. Spielberg did a masterful job of adapting "Always" with characters bearing the same names as those in "A Guy Named Joe," the real-world depictions of World War II-era aircraft for wildfire suppression bombers, and references to water bomber bases resembling WWII bomber bases. Watch "A Guy Named Joe" and then watch "Always" to best appreciate the combined genius of Dalton Trumbo and Steven Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a glorious, feel good movie. I've always liked "A Guy Named Joe" and found this charming piece an equal to the original. True, Dreyfuss is no Spence, Hunter sure isn't Dunne, and Johnson can't hold a candle to Van, but all in all as remakes go this was great. The set up scenes where Dreyfuss buys Hunter the dress and then at the bar has to share her with all the fliers is funny. Showing Johnson first catching a glimpse of her and seeing in his eyes what we will come to find out later in the movie sets the whole plot up quite nicely. Dreyfuss' last night spent with Hunter where she explains to him how she feels and her comment about risking his life for trees seems hollow, that she could understand if he was doing what he did to save a life was prophetic to say the least for as we see in the next scenes, Dreyfuss does indeed give his life to save his best friend, Al Yackey played by Goodman. Goodman plays (quite well I might add) the role of Dreyfuss' best buddy, but also takes on the wonderful added role of friend, confidant, and protector of Hunter. When he brings her back to the base to face her loss and then sees her interaction with Johnson you realize how much he really does care for those around him. Audrey Hapburn as Hap was simply marvelous. Although she did appear tired, she gave the role something that brought the whole movie together. Her quiet demeanor as she leads Dreyfuss to his, shall we say, redemption is a masterpiece. Watch both films and see just how a remake should be done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally (cinematheque)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrary of its title, the movie is a swan's song: it's the final movie with Spielberg for Dreyfuss and it's the last movie for Miss Hepburn before she goes to her hair stylist. The entire movie is about ending (death, end of romance, leaving friends). However, as it's a Spielberg's movie, it's not about mourning and desolation but a vibrant call for love and optimism. For me, this movie would be always indeed my favorite Spielberg's because it's one of the best love movies that I have seen.As unusual as it is, I'm sure the setting in an incendiary unit brings something particular, fire being the image of passion. Also, the facetious Dreyfuss and John Goodman brings a lot of warmth but the movie is clearly illuminated by Holly Hunter. I didn't know her well but she is an amazing brunette, small, fragile but also courageous and passionate. With her, Spielberg can amend a filmography a bit too masculine, because his hero is always a boy or a man. Now, it's true that we can't talk about this movie without mentioning "Ghost" that have the same story (a ghost lover) and the same choice for a 50's song ("unchained melody" vs "smoke gets in your eye"). "Always" has failed while "Ghost" wins it all. However, my preference goes to "Always" because it's more powerful, devoid of all violence and without Whoopi (see below) as well. Pairing: "Purple color": maybe it's only other love story but as it stars Whoopi, this is the only Spielberg's movie i will never see.</fullReview>

The original version was set in WWII, but the story line is true to it's essence. Where Richard Dryfus plays an aerial fire fighter, Spencer Tracey is a fighter polite. The story line similarities are the dual love interests, the initial jealousy of the dead hot-shot pilot boyfriend who doesn't want to admit he can't be the love interest of "his girl". But same as in the re-make, he eventually realizes all he's really interested in is her happiness, and steers them together. The endings are almost identical...."That's my girl,...and that's my boy.", and saunters off whistling, then fade to black.</fullReview>

Always has the benefit of John Goodman and all the awesome lines he delivers. Always has better effects, and a tight story.

Al's plane catches on fire and Pete saves him but loses his own life. In the afterlife, Pete meets Hap (Audrey Hepburn) who sends him back to the world to inspire people. Al is now running a school and Ted Baker (Brad Johnson) is the newbie. Dorinda is depressed working as an air traffic controller. Al takes her back with him to Colorado.Steven Spielberg is not known for romance. The comedy bits from Goodman is alright. I have no doubt that Spielberg wanted to stretch but he struggled to make this compelling. The movie starts well with some chemistry between Dreyfuss and Hunter. They have a good report. The problem is that the chemistry becomes a much more complicated thing. She basically has two loves and Johnson has no charisma at all. It becomes wonky although Dreyfuss keeps it from falling apart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considered to be one of Steven Spielberg's worst movies a massive flop at the time of release in 1989. I never got round to watching it until today when it was on TV, and in the absence of anything else on, I decided to give it a go. The likable cast is headed by Richard Dreyfuss as the spirit of a recently deceased expert pilot who mentors a newer pilot, while watching him fall in love with his surviving girlfriend.I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. The still gorgeous Katherine Hepburn (in her last role), Holly Hunter and John Goodman offer stellar support to Dreyfuss who is on top form. A good movie for me is one that does not end with the credits, and this one stayed with me for a while after it's heartwarming conclusion. All the lead characters seem nice people to hang out with, and I'm not gonna lie, I shed a year at the end too. Given the talent involved, I'm surprised this failed to find an audience, and I think If it was sold it differently it might have done differently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies, my wife and I watched it in the drive-in not long after we were first married so maybe that's why it holds a special nostalgic place in my heart.I was quite surprised to hear several years later that this was considered to be a failure (or at least less than a success) for Spielberg.While the themes of the movie may seem formulaic, the way the pieces fit together is anything but. Overall it's a great love story which also examines the qualities of heroism vs. selfishness, and it has a great sense of humor throughout. All of the actors put in heartfelt performances.If he was trying to channel Capra, then he certainly succeeded, IMO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You're probably wondering why I didn't give this a "10"--a "10" is for penicillin and democracy. But that bit of humor aside, this movie has it all: drama, suspense, romance, adventure, fantasy, comedy. To me, it is one of the most consistently underrated movies of all time and it's more than "just another ghost movie". I love Irene Dunne movies and I'm a Spencer Tracy fan as well, and when I heard this was a "remake", I was appalled. But it's more of a re-working of the movie "A Guy named Joe", than an out and out remake of it. There are a few subtle differences; "A Guy named Joe" takes place during World War II and Spencer Tracy is pilot bombing the enemy and Irene Dunne is a WAC. "Always" puts Richard Dreyfuss as a pilot who bombs forest fires with retardant to help the smoke jumpers on the ground. But even as many times as I've watched "Always", I'm always biting my nails and on the edge of my seat during the forest fire scenes. I still cry when Pete helps Dorinda swim to the surface of the lake when her plane crashes and when Pete moves out of her heart to go face her future. I laugh at John Goodman's dance scene and when Ted lights Al's cigar on fire and the "Give him a chance, Al!" line. And of course, Miss Audrey Hepburn is sublime! Yes, Miss Hepburn's part is smaller than I would have liked, but that would have detracted from the fact that Pete needed to figure most of the situations out on his own. Richard Dreyfuss, Holly Hunter, John Goodman and Brad Johnson are all wonderful in this movie, the dialogue is well written, and the cinematography is fabulous. "Always" is my go-to movie, no matter what genre of film I want to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's better to have loved and lost, than etc etc......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Always is a landmark film in Steven Spielberg's canon for more than one reason. It would be the first time Spielberg would adapt someone else's work, and also it would see Spielberg caught in transition between bidding farewell to childhood memories and a crowd pleasing necessity. In fact it is not too bold to say that without Always, Spielberg could not have progressed into the superlative director he most assuredly is. Often wrongly thought of as a Spielberg flop, it actually grossed $74,134,790 worldwide, that's three times what it cost to make. Always is awash with sentimentality, the kind that Spielberg detractors use to constantly berate the director as being his safe haven calling card, yet it's an oddly tender movie about loss, love and the need to move on from former yearnings. Working from the excellent original source by Dalton Trumbo called A Guy Named Joe, Spielberg crafts his tale with deftly visual flourishes aiding the sweet nature of the piece, none more so than when Audrey Hepburn arrives {in her last film appearance} as Pete's angel guide, Hap.Richard Dreyfuss takes the lead role of Pete Sandwich, with both he and Spielberg sharing a passion for A Guy Named Joe. So much so that Spielberg honoured a promise to Dreyfuss back in the Jaws days that he would cast him should he ever remake the film. Holly Hunter takes on the pivotal female lead of Dorinda and does brilliant work, all doe eyed beauty fusing with tight emotion that has the discerning viewer eating out of her hands. John Goodman is suitably ebullient as Al Yackey, with Spielberg framing him rather well in certain scenic sequences, while the only weak link in the film is probably Brad Johnson as Ted Baker, but time has been kind to his performance and it doesn't quite jar as much as it used too. The critics hated it on release and the watching public were most indifferent to it as well. Yet it's definitely one to revisit as we all get older, be it with a loved one or during times of reflection. You obviously can't get away from the sentimental aspects of it, but sometimes sentiment is a necessity to smooth out those rough edges. Charming, delightful and a real important film in Steven Spielberg's career. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah! What a bloody pity that not many of the commentators seem to notice or bother to mention Audrey Hepburn's last and luminous-as-always presence in that movie ! As for the movie itself, in spite of Spielberg's undeniable craftsmanship and storytelling abilities (and perhaps apart from «Schlinder's List»), this entry is enjoyable while being watched but -- and this is my own personal opinion -- nothing much is left to cherish with either my mind or heart once the «spectacle» is over and the manipulative sentimentality has worn off. This being said, I must admit that I'm usually moved by the sentimentality usually found at the end of many of Spielberg's films. But, as in a dream, once I «awake» to everyday reality and ponder upon his movies, well... nothing much of consistency is left for to enjoy in a retrospective manner ! Am I the only person with these views about most of this «great» filmmaker's productions ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess I see this movie from a pilots point of view, and although like most aviation films pilots can pick apart all of the inaccuracies that they see. But really this film isn't all about aviation. The flying, the airplanes and the interaction with aviation in this movie really serves as a means to deliver the real idea.Richard Dreyfuss, Holly Hunter and John Goodman do an amazing job. The overall ambiance of the movie, in my opinion, wipes away all the little things that might bother some moviegoers. I first saw this movie many many years ago and fell in love with it.

		<shortDescription>Another Perfect Spielburg/Trumbo Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Always" is a remake of the 1943 MGM film "A Guy Named Joe", which had a screenplay written by Dalton Trumbo, one of "The Hollywood Ten" who was accused of being a Communist by Senator Joseph McCarthy, and thus blacklisted from the industry. The original film dealt with a hot-shot B-17 Bomber pilot, played by Spencer Tracy, who was shot down, and was given a chance by Heaven to go back and inspire another bomber pilot to success. In the original film, the pilot he helped was played by Van Johnson, and the girl between them was played by Irene Dunne. The film did not get great reviews at the time because it was produced as a morale builder for the war effort, and so it was rushed to completion, but that the story was a great one in any event is proved by its use in this film by Sten Spielburg to great effect. This film would NOT be as good without the Trumbo screenplay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Always' is a poignant, adventure-filled, magical love story. One of Spielberg's best. So why did I like it more than 'Ghost'? First, we never see Pete (Richard Dreyfuss) walk through walls like Sam. Secondly (and what I like most), Dorinda (Holly Hunter) isn't callow like Molly. Dorinda's a strong-willed, somewhat tomboyish woman who doesn't take crap (when Pete gets Evel Knievelish in his flying, she steals a plane to show him). She also saves the day in the climax while Molly runs. Thirdmost, the ending was also a little more happier (but just as moving) than 'Ghost', when Pete says, "I'm releasing you" and Dorinda goes with the others, smiling. Pete's last line is, "That's my girl. And that's my boy." He smiles and walks down the runway to Heaven. If you haven't seen this film, SEE it. You'll love it.</fullReview>

The players work well together in director Steven Spielberg's little sleeper which is both lightweight and heartfelt. It is Audrey Hepburn's last film too. Richard Dreyfuss plays a firefighting pilot who dies in the air to save his buddy (John Goodman) from a similar fate.

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg took a break from his usual sci-fi/action fare with this story of firefighter Pete Sandich (Richard Dreyfuss) who sticks with his friends...even after dying. Maybe "Always" is a little hokey, but it's an interesting look at the possibilities not only of the afterlife, but of personal guilt: not only does Pete feel that he has to right some wrongs, but his friends Dorinda Durston (Holly Hunter) and Al Yackey (John Goodman) also are dealing with the guilt of seeing their friend gone, and the role that they may have played in his death.On another note, this was of course Audrey Hepburn's final film. She plays angel Hap, who helps Pete through the afterlife. In my opinion, it makes sense for a woman as beautiful as she to play an angel in her final role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had forgotten that this was a Spielberg film. I had forgotten that John Williams did the score. I had forgotten what a nice film this is, until I saw it again tonight. "Always" is a fantasy, Pete (Richard Dreyfuss) is the best firefighting pilot, but dies when his plane catches fire and explodes, right after he extinguishes the fire of his friend's (John Goodman) plane. That's really when the story gets going. Holly Hunter plays his girl, and he doesn't want to let her go, even in his death. He is a ghost for most of the film, encouraging a new pilot, or others, to do their best.The funniest scene, Pete wanders into an old barn where a crazy man is ranting, and then discovers that the crazy man repeats the words that Pete is thinking. But he doesn't repeat the whole phrase, only parts, and the message gets totally reversed, sending the new pilot away to romance Pete's girl. In the end, Pete can only get closure, and his girl can only start getting good nights of sleep, after Pete lets go. The dialog and acting are uniformly superb throughout the film. It has more funny monents than sad, and the resolution is uplifting. Just a very nice "feel good" movie to watch any time. And the action scenes, the planes flying, the forest on fire, are very exciting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Always" combines Speilberg's sentimentalism with an interesting scenario.. the ghost of a pilot who can't leave his earth-bound love. The casting is brilliant. Richard Dreyfuss plays the newly-departed with a charm and wit that's essential for the plot to work. Holly Hunter is charming, earthy, tough , yet fragile enough for us all to feel for her and with her. The movie, a remake of "A Guy Called Joe" works on a few levels.. it looks at the concepts of "inspiration", earth-bound spirits, and the meaning of it all. This film always makes us laugh and cry. And Audrey Hepburn's appearance (only months before her death)as a guardian angel, is a poignant piece of casting. It's a lovely film, not without some holes, but honest, caring and surprisingly lacking in Hollywood cliche. The last shot is beautiful.I give it 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie usually is poo-poohed for several reasons. Speilberg may have been stuck by fantasy about what he was doing rather than what he actually put on screen. The original 40's movie, I understand, was one of Speilberg's favorites in childhhood and perhaps he replayed it so much in his mind that he forgot to pay attention. There's a disconnect between the planes in flames shots and what the story is really about. Episodes are shoved adjacenty to each other as if that would serve integration and synthesis all by itself.What's really fine about this movie is its sensitivity and tenderness between Dreyfuss and Hunter. There's maturity and understanding rarel found in Hollywooddom.Speilberg gets the most out of Drefuss' abilities in this regard. It appears theat Speilberg and Dreyfuss really worked together on this one. Hunter turns a really outstanding performance; the movie couldn't have made it without her; she provides another kind of fire that ignites the drama of this movie. Very disappointing is Goodman who shows that the even with the best direction he will provide truly forgettable characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg is one of the Greatest Fillmakers of World Cinema, his body of work gives u goosebumps. He has made a list of remarkable films, of which many have gone down as Cult/Classics. Now, 'Always' which takes inspiration from the 1943 movie A Guy Named Joe, isn't a bad film in any aspect, but what goes against this honest effort is it's brand, Steven Spielberg.'Always' is a simple tale on a legendary pilot, which has been made with utmost honesty. The film has a story to tell and the Master Of Film-making has done his job, but one can't except him to make a one-time watch kinda film. The film was a box office flop during it release, and has remained as Spielberg's weakest effort as a filmmaker to date. For me it ain't his weakest, but as mentioned in my summary, his not-so-cool stuff! Coming to the acting department, Audrey Hepburn is all grace. Richard Dreyfuss is superb. In fact, this is amongst his better works. Holly Hunter is flawless, yet again. This underrated actress needs to make a comeback in mainstream films! John Goodman is likable. Brad Johnson does a sincere job.On the whole 'Always' is a decent flick, watch it if you must!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's failed remake of "A Guy Named Joe" has fire-pilot Richard Dreyfuss killed on the job, spending the rest of the movie looking after girlfriend Holly Hunter in ghostly form. After a grueling start (filled with gags that don't play and characters who don't convince), Spielberg settles into a predictable, home-sweet-home rut--a love story with comedic asides. Audrey Hepburn, in her final film, looks lovely as the angel Hap, but her sequences are handled in such a frozen, immobile fashion that one just watches her as Hepburn the Star (there's no chance for a character to emerge). Once Spielberg gains solid footing, the plot of "Always" has already played out its cards. If you haven't attached your emotions to the other-worldly relationship between Dreyfuss and Hunter by this point, then the finale will undoubtedly fail to be moving. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

The characters are well-written, well-acted, three-dimensional and lovable. The first third of the movie (before Pete's accident) is loaded with honest laughter, inspired by real humor. No sight gags, cursing-to-get-a-laugh, or parody. Pete's death is felt by the audience, who already likes him, and his interaction with those he left behind is at times hilarious, touching, and (ironically) human. His friendship is felt, and his jealousy is understandable. The entire cast acted with their hearts, not their heads, and that makes "Always" a true masterpiece of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is replete with sentimentality, unprofessional flying that makes a pilot like me cringe, and irrelevant material. Why introduce Rachel, for instance? She has absolutely nothing to do with the film except to permit her "Follow Me" truck to run wild and crash into Dorinda's fence. That has got to be one of the stupider sequences among many in the film. Another is at the end when the aircraft (was it a B-26 or an A-26? --both designations are used in the film) is left with props whirling and no chocks in place. That serves the plot, of course, but to reveal it would be to commit a dreaded spoiler. As it is, the aircraft would have begun to taxi sans control. The ending (again, avoiding spoilers) involves much too much talk -- as at the beginning of sound films in the 30s with all those final speeches. Here, Dreyfuss just babbles on and on. The ending also incorporates other radical violations of aircraft protocol and a couple of improbabilities/impossibilities that I won't describe. What a dull and disjointed effort!</fullReview>

That is the message and theme of this beautiful heartbreaking subtle masterpiece which is so underrated and forgotten that it almost feels like it does not exist to many people but it does but many people hate it because they are not used to seeing Steven Spielberg direct this kind of film which is a shame because it has a subliminal message and essence of love and thoughtfulness and forgiveness because maybe we are not there for the ones we love and the time we would all like to spend with one another is too much or we all get carried away with jobs or work commitments which takes away the time we have with our loved ones so does death in a way and the film explores the themes of what happens after we die do we just enter a void of nothing or do remain a helpful part of the next generation do we support and comfort the people we cherish and help them guide them even though you can't see them they will always be there any time anywhere and that is what Hap Audrey Hepburn's Character explains to Richard Dreyfuss's Character Pete Anything you do for yourself is a wasted spirit your life is over and at the end after Pete tells Hap that he is not ready to say goodbye to Dorinda the woman he loved all those years ago Hap simply says you have to free yourself and let her go otherwise if you don't she will not be set free and ready to move on and look forward to the next goal the next phase of her life your life is over the time you had has gone you had your chance it is time to remember and let her go as Pete learns his lesson he finally lets her go when he says go on go on after a beautiful scene of acceptance and remembrance where Pete tells Dorinda those magic words I love You something he was afraid of saying something uncomfortable for him he never tells Dorinda how he feels he always lets his job get in the way his friends his life outside of his love life he always shrugged or pushed the romantic element of their love aside, Dorinda and Pete's relationship is strained they never could connect or bond they are 2 very different people with different paths or directions they feel are the right choices Dorinda feels insecure about Pete's job as a fire pilot but as you discover throughout the film she never has the confidence to explore different careers she was always happy on the ground Pete's spirit helps her overcome her fears and worries which help her in her life and ends Pete's life fulfilling the purpose of his life to care for her in her time of need and to cherish her thoughts and her dreams Dorinda always shops in her sleep which creates a memory for Pete similar to Jim's Mother's piano melody in Empire of the Sun or Celie and Nettie's hand clapping motion and song in the Color Purple That is Pete's Memory Dorinda creating the shopping list in her sleep that is the core memory the thought that Pete's spirit remembers cherishes holds dear in his heart even in death! I loved Audrey Hepburn's couple of scenes as Hap she is the light in Pete's afterlife and guide she helps him understand how to morn the loss of your own life the loving romance to his wife but also how to grieve and remember the life you have enjoyed and cherished all the friends you made the family you loved and respected I wish there was someone like Hap to guide me through the problems in my life I Really need it right now my life is very worrying and sad my life is not what I expected it to be when I was welcomed into the world by my Mother and Father I am depressed lonely and scared of all the things that could happen to me any day now Back to the film Hap's purpose and the film's purpose is to say look back on all the memories in your life and cherish them for as long as you can and enjoy your life while it lasts because you still have a life to enjoy after all and never feel disappointed in yourself because sometimes the memories that come back to haunt you will never go away and will leave a permanent sense of guilt in your life in conclusion hold to what you have and never look back because sometimes the things we love most they never truly leave us even if that is in life or in death you can always find them in your heart or spirit! Thank you Steven for showing me the light and telling to always look forward never look back and to never forget the things we hold dear in our hearts whether that be good happy memories or sad lonely memories Always is a beautiful romantic thoughtful perspective on life it teaches us all how to live our life's decently and to treat people with compassion and dignity!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a classic 80's action/humor/romance movie centered around aerial firefighting. Thankfully this film was shot before the CGI era, so the aircraft flight scenes are all live action. The storyline is a bit corny, and the hair/clothes are dated, but the acting is great. In my opinion this is one of the best John Goodman movies. I think it really captured his range as an actor. Richard Dreyfus also had a strong showing in this film, and the on camera chemistry between the two seemed genuine. My only criticism of the film was the technical inaccuracies involving the aircraft. As is often mentioned, the A-26 would have no problem climbing after dropping it's load. In fact, with the inertia it gained after diving heavy, NOT climbing after dropping the load would have been difficult. All-in-all though I thought it was a great movie, definitely a must watch from the Dirty Dancing era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic love story. Better than "Titanic" actually.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years, I've seen many love stories. And I've like them all. My favorite one for a while was "Titanic," (which I don't see as a chick-flick), and this certainly is no exception. It's actually better than "Titanic." Spielberg can make anything from action movies to dramas to comedies to horror movies to love stories, even. I don't understand how this is avoidable. It's a great film.One of the things that I liked about this movie was Audrey Hepburn. She was excellent as an angel. I was deeply touched by this movie. I've been looking for it everywhere to buy, but still haven't found it. But I won't stop looking until it goes in my DVD collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I was in charge of the Academy Awards (thank heavens I'm not cause not many people would like me) this movie would have swept them all. It's a beautiful film full of love and passion and friendship. Keeping those close to you right where they belong in your heart. Though a little like Ghost (though this did come first) it was wonderfully made. You really feel the pain and hurt Pete felt when he saw Dorinda kissing Ted. And you just wanted to knock Ted out for stealing Pete's gal. But you also feel glad that she is starting to move on in her life. You know that she has to let Pete go but she will always love him. If you have not seen this film. Go out and see it right now. It's one of the very best movies ever made!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I cannot watch this movie without crying...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie like five or six times, and I can't stop crying. The ending sets up such a lovely relationship. The fact that Pete can't say "I love you" and then he does right before he gets in the plane (the plane ride that kills him) but she doesn't hear him, is so unbelievably sad. If I had a more powerful word than sad I would be using it. Then after he dies, she tries to move on, but can't and ends up trying to run away from her memories of him. This is extremely realistic, and anyone who has lost someone can relate to it. I don't understand how people can see it as a bad movie. It is a heartfelt and emotional story that makes you want to jump in the movie and hug the characters to try and comfort them. The acting was magnificent by ALL of the actors. Each one brought something to the movie that made the film that much better. I can't explain this movie in any other way. BEAUTIFUL.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Always" follows the story of pilot Pete Sandich, a good guy with a goofy sense of humor and a heart of gold. He's in love with Dorinda Durston, and they want to get married.Everything falls apart when Pete is killed in a plane crash (while fighting a raging forest fire) while attempting to save his best friend Al, whose plane's engine caught on fire. Pete saves his friend, but soon discovers *he's* the one who needs to be saved now -- his left propeller has caught on fire, and it's about to reach the fuel tank. Pete takes one last look at his best friend as his plane blows up.He then finds himself walking in the barren forest, not yet knowing he is dead until he meets an "angel" who explains to him what has happened -- six months earlier, he was killed when his plane blew up, and is now in the form of a ghost. No one can hear him or see him. And now Dorinda has a new man in her life, Ted, a somewhat clueless wannabe-pilot who is in love with her.Pete now has to say goodbye to the one he loves, even though he never confessed those three little words to her -- but in his heart, he loved her more than anything in the world."Always" is a touching, charming, funny, and feel-good film that will capture your heart. With terrific performances, a brilliant script, and beautiful cinematography, this is one film you can watch and laugh &amp; cry at the same time.I give "Always" 9.5 out of 10.mswelles</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Combines Too Much And In The End Disappoints</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie ended with me scratching my head. Steven Spielberg seems to have put out a movie that tries to combine action-adventure (the story of fire fighter pilots) with a romance (the story of one pilot who's killed, and the difficulty the woman who loved him has moving on) and then he wrapped it up inside a fantasy (the pilot who was killed sort of keeps watch over his ex-love as a ghost while being the inner voice/instructor of a young fire fighter pilot.) Maybe it was just too bizarre a combination of things, but it didn't seem to work very well. The fire fighting scenes were exciting, but they were so scattered so that there was no sustained excitement; the romance - while sometimes sweet - lacked any real sense of passion. The fantasy aspect was well done, but when it was all put together it just didn't work that well.The performances were all right, but no one was truly outstanding. Richard Dreyfuss was the lead as Pete - the fire fighter pilot turned ghost, but I honestly didn't find it to be one of his stronger performances. At least in my experience of the man's work I've only seen him play one other "romantic" role - in 1977's "The Good Bye Girl." His performance in that was by far the superior. The other primary actors were Holly Hunter as Dorinda (Pete's romantic partner), Brad Johnson as Ted, the pilot Pete is supposed to guide and who becomes (perhaps too conveniently) Dorinda's new love interest, and John Goodman as Al - a fellow pilot. Goodman was probably the best of that trio, Hunter was OK but not great and Johnson didn't do anything for me. Perhaps this movie is most interesting because it was Audrey Hepburn's last film - she plays "Hap" - the angel (?) who explains Pete's new role to him after his death. The role was small, but Hepburn was fine in it.</fullReview>

Richard Dreyfuss and Holly Hunter are a wonderful couple together and John Goodman also shows his dramatic skills. Extra plus is Audrey Hepburn's presence in her last role.The forest fire sequences are filmed in a wonderful way and the aerial sequences are filmed in such a way that they seem like WW II dogfights, which I think was done on purpose.

		<fullReview>It's hard to feel how Holly Hunter affects the average male movie audience in this movie, either as a sexy tiny grown woman or a sexy tiny teen-a-bopper. Either way she cannot be ignored when on screen. Comments about Richard Dreyfuss as always are not need as he is always perfect. The script, corny by some, is well done for a picture with ghosts, much better than most. The setting in the Pacific NorthWest is perfect. The musical score is outstanding as to its choices of the correct timing with the acting. The flying scenes of the WWII planes are fantastic and very real. Background sound engineers on the film deserve credit with their work. The cameo appearance of Audrey Hepburn just a few years before her death is a great plus for the film. All in all this is a film that should be in everyones library and re-watched at least once a year with someone you care for, only if to see Holly and Richard at their best. She is the prize package of Hollywood compact ladies. He is a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a director loves his job, sometimes he just wants to make a movie which is great fun in making. I have no doubt that the filming of "Always" was an unforgettable experience to those involved in it, because this is a light and unpretentious work, which, however, keeps scoring high on Spielberg's trade mark magic charts. This is due to the fact that the production team kept the same love for the movie they would give if this was "Schindler's List" or "Indiana Jones". This dedication comes out as a work which shows movie magic and beauty at its best. Let's just say that this movie lives on its cinematography and its music, the story element being given for the first time a back seat. One reaches the conclusion that this movie is to be taken lightly, and no one should expect a master piece, although many will love it for its tenderness, and for the fact it is an unique work in Spielberg's career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's Worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg, despite the constant whining of the naysayers, is a truly gifted filmmaker. Well, even Babe Ruth struck out from time to time. "Always" isn't just Spielberg striking out, it's Spielberg striking out looking on three straight pitches."The Lost World" had its moments, "Hook" had some neat visuals, "1941" is truly fascinating to watch for a variety of reasons...but "Always" just has nothing going for it. Yes, Spielberg remembered "A Guy Named Joe" affectionately from his childhood...but I remember "The Karate Kid" affectionately from my childhood, but that doesn't mean I think it needs to be remade.Nothing really comes together for me in this movie. It's just some pretty good actors kind of wandering aimlessly through some half-connected and half-written scenes. It's almost there, but just never really works. Compare this with "1941," wherein absolutely nothing even comes close to working - but at least it's interesting to watch a film self-destruct that badly. "Always" is so amazingly bland that it doesn't even manage to generate interest on that level.The worst part of the movie, though, is that what little emotion it generates is the worst of what Spielberg's critics accuse him of - over-sentimentalized tripe. The late-80's/early-90's, with "Always" and "Hook" represents the unquestionable low point of Spielberg's career - saccharine, melodramatic, overblown...perhaps as a reaction to poor response to the truly brilliant "Empire of the Sun," perhaps for other reasons unknown and unguessable...but it seems that Spielberg is aiming to give audiences and critics no more than they absolutely expect from him. It's unfortunate because shortly doing after these two films, Spielberg directed "Schindler's List" and moved into a period where he has shown us that he is capable so very, very much more.If only he had applied that ability to "Always," material for which he clearly has great affection, he could have created a truly complete, emotionally moving story..."E.T." with ghosts instead of aliens...but as it stands, it's an empty shell that no one ever bothered to put nearly enough effort into.</fullReview>

Audrey Hepburn is luminous, and the scenery of the Pacific Northwest is stunning. Newcomer Brad Johnson is a total hottie and the movie is worth a watch just for his dinner scene with Holly Hunter in her adorable cottage at sunset. His other great scene involves a bus driver &amp; a very realistic (&amp; heroic) administration of CPR.

		<shortDescription>sentiment and Steven Spielberg: not a good combination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few directors have the clout to film a mediocre remake of an already mediocre wartime romance (1944s 'A Guy Named Joe'), updated from aerial combat to aerial fire fighting but with all the sloppy sentiment intact. The result is an anachronistic romantic fantasy more convincing (no surprise here) in the fantasy department: ace pilot Richard Dreyfuss dies in a plane crash, but his spirit returns to comfort grieving girlfriend Holly Hunter and guide flyboy / klutz Brad Johnson. It's in the romantic scenes where Spielberg loses his footing, creating flames aplenty in the Montana pines but not a spark within his miscast trio of stars. Dreyfuss, in particular, is hardly credible as a romantic hero, and Johnson, cut from the same Superman cloth as Christopher Reeve, isn't required to be much more than a gorgeous hunk. The film has to be written off as an indulgent sidestep in the career of a talented but too powerful director: Spielberg is clearly wearing his heart on his sleeve but, true to the lyrics of the maudlin theme song (heard incessantly throughout), smoke obviously got in his eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is another missed opportunity.Dreyfus's performance as a pilot who everybody loves for his lively persona and humor (during his living version at least) is delightful .He incarnates convincingly one of the most likable characters you can encounter in a movie.His popularity is exposed and manifested carefully until it reaches the absolute climax.And then we have the major twist of the movie and of course Spielberg has to ruin what he so carefully achieved by leaning towards the melodramatic as he almost always does .The easy predictable solution that compromised the quality of even the would be masterpiece "Shindler's List" reducing it to a two thirds worthwhile experience and almost totally ruined "Empire of the sun" again haunts this effort.Spielberg has and seeks for no excuses.His approach is the easy commercial one and it is made consciously.But for the thinking viewer it is another let down.Of course the film was not meant to be an epic and many would argue that as a light drama it fulfills some basic expectations .Still, after a flying start and a near perfect first half you expect much more and the disappointment for the soap opera that follows is great . A movie is supposed to be watched throughout .More realism and less dramatic pretension and supernatural interventions would have benefited this film greatly.Parts of Spielberg films are to be included in the very best in cinematic history.This film has its share of very good "light" moments.But as a total it is definitely average at best.And it hurts to admit that once again another of the films that include one of my favorite first halves has to be rated as low as any other mediocre film.Worth your while only if you are prepared to be lifted high only to be thrown down again.Without a parachute...5.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AlwaysThe worst thing about dying on a plane is that your last meal is an infinitesimal amount of complimentary pretzels and your choice of coffee, tea or juice.Unfortunately, the fire-bomber pilot in this drama didn't have enough time to decide his beverage before crashing.While on his last dump of fire retardant, pilot Pete's (Richard Dreyfuss) plane explodes mid-air.Waking in the company of heavenly hairdresser (Audrey Hepburn), Pete is told of his afterlife's purpose: to inspire a new pilot (Brad Johnson).But when the rookie takes a shine to his widow (Holly Hunter), Pete persuades the newbie to volunteer for a dangerous mission in hopes he fails.While Steven Spielberg's remake of A Guy Named Joe, lacks the director's grandiose style, it does contain heaps of his schmaltziness.Besides, when you die in a plane crash you don't go to heaven, you go into the survivors' intestinal tracks.

		<shortDescription>Always (1989)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has taken me almost a decade to figure this out, but "Always" is a very good film- maybe even a great one. This is odd, because "Always", until recently, had always been one of the few Spielberg titles that I was somewhat hesitant to defend. I had never doubted its decency as an entertainment, but I was often willing to acknowledge that it was one of his weakest films. I think the reason was usually the fact that it's one of his poorest reviewed works. The thing is, unlike "1941", with which you can ignore the bad reviews and simply enjoy the movie because it was all fun and games, "Always" is quite clearly a film that Spielberg wanted to be taken seriously. It's never good when the audience is laughing for all the wrong reasons.But then just recently, I revisited "Always". I realized that I had forgotten much of what occurs in the film because I had seen it years earlier. I wondered if perhaps, now that I had gotten older, I would be able to better understand what the filmmakers were getting at. Suddenly, I was surprised to find out many things: that John Williams's score is a treasure; that Michael Kahn's editing makes this two-hour feature move like a streak; that Jerry Belson's screenplay is actually intelligent and expertly written; and that Spielberg directs with the threads that only a master could weave. Sure enough, not only is "Always" a much stronger film than I remember it being, but it has even aged nicely."Always" has only one glaring flaw: the miscasting of Brad Johnson in the role of Ted Baker. Because this is a love story about two people who simply have got to move on, it doesn't help to know that Dorinda is now falling for a guy who doesn't have any of the charisma or charm of Pete. Ted is the equivalent of a male dumb blonde and is almost hilariously stupid; when he's in a bar chatting with a saucy redhead (Mary Helgenberger), he blurts out that he's still thinking about "the girl I met last summer" (as Pete puts it while in ghostly form, "I don't think I'm familiar with this technique, Ted"). Also, when Ted and Dorinda finally hook up, Ted immediatedly gets impatient when Dorinda starts rambling about Pete. How are we supposed to like Ted if he can't even think well of Pete's memory? And sure, the female audiences all thought Brad Johnson was "a hunk", but COME ON! Does he even know how to ACT? Why did Spielberg cast him in this movie? What was Johnson thinking when he did those terrible John Wayne impersonations not just once, but FOUR times? Either the part should have been written better, and/or a better, more experienced young actor should have been cast in the role.One thing about the film that is still pretty confusing is the title. Apparently, Spielberg had wanted to call the film "Always" because he had planned to use the Irving Berlin theme "Always" as Pete and Dorinda's dance song. Problem was, Berlin (who was near death at the time) refused to sell Spielberg the rights to the song. So, Spielberg had to use "Smoke Gets In Your Eyes" as Pete and Dorinda's dance song- but he couldn't use it for the film's title because it would sound offensive to slap that title onto a film that was, really, about people who sometimes got killed in forest fires. Ultimately, Spielberg ended up using "Always" as the film's title, even though this title had already been used for a 1985 independent film directed by filmmaker Henry Jaglom, who, ironically, did not have a good relationship with Spielberg (Jaglom had once criticized "The Color Purple" as "a Disney version of The Grapes of Wrath")."Always" is a sentimental film. That is for certain. But that should not be a sole reason for criticizing it. This, after all, was how Spielberg really felt about the story. Without the sentimentality, perhaps "Always" could still be admired for its technical accomplishments, but nevertheless, it would still be hard to, well... enjoy the film. Part of what makes "Always" such a fantastic achievement is that we care about what happens to Pete and Dorinda. We wish they could have gone on to live a happy life together. We wish Pete could have told Dorinda, while he was still alive, that he loved her. But what would the movies be if characters only did what we wanted them to? What happens to Pete is sad, but ultimately, Hap was right: neither Pete nor Dorinda will ever be free until they are able to let go. When they finally do, we, as an audience, are like Pete and Dorinda, and are finally willing to accept it. This, of course, was not the only film Spielberg made in 1989 that was about letting go. What does Henry Jones Sr. tell Indy at the end of "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"? "Indiana... let it go".When "Always" ends, we are able to let go, but without regret. We are like Pete and Dorinda. We are free.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Worth Seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this film was based on a story called "A Guy named Joe". I like that title better than "Always" which refers to never-ending love. This is certainly a love story, but it cannot claim to be original in its ideas. You'll liken it to "Ghost" or, if you go further back, to Noel Coward's "Blithe Spirit". This film is not as good as either of those.Don't let me put you off this film. It is worth seeing if only for the fire fighting scenes. Planes racing at top neck speed clipping the tops of forest trees all exploding in raging fires are some of the best action scenes I have seen in years. I understand that archival footage of past forest fires are used together with studio special effects. "Special" is the word. The result is truly amazing as you watch planes flying through flames.The love story could have a little more fire in it, although it does improve over time.I cannot quite accept the character that Audrey Hepburn plays. She appears a couple of times but the scenes could be left out without affecting the film in any way.The film does acknowledge the bravery of those men and women who fight fires from the skies.

		<shortDescription>A fantasy film that pulls at the heartstrings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When released, this movie rode the initial wave of popularity based on the incredible list of actors, most notably Holly Hunter and Richard Dreyfuss, and has remained a favorite for over 15 years now. It was my first introduction to the Marlboro model turned actor, Brad Johnson, whose rugged good looks and acting ability made him an instant favorite of the audience. The fantasy of the film removes one from the daily grind and takes the viewer to a special place.... poignant and, yes, somewhat syrupy sweet, but comforting. The script allows the movie goer to read deeply into hidden meanings of words / situations, or simply enjoy the story on a less philosophical level. "Always" will "Always" be one of my all time favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Always" is an enjoyable film, largely on the strength of Holly Hunter and John Goodman's performances. Unfortunately, it would have been better with almost anyone but Richard Dreyfus. Normally a fine actor, he is woefully miscast here. Sorry folks, but I've spent my entire life in aviation and never knew, met, or even heard of anyone who speaks and acts like Pete. Dreyfus simply has no credibility in the role.Spielberg's love of aviation shows throughout, with some excellent flying scenes and a variety of Manly Man aircraft: old, solid machines with big round engines. After that, jets are for kids (and Maverick was the biggest kid of all!) Finally, I concur with previous comments ref. Audrey Hepburn. Who better to play a guiding, occasionally scolding angel?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful and it came from A Guy Named Joe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film touched me deeply, sentimental though it is. The photography is excellent and the setting in a fire camp has the flavor of real.But scene after scene, line after line, and even the character names are right out of Spencer Tracy's A Guy Named Joe (1943). Spencer flies (of course a B-25, as does Richard Dreyfuss. The scene with Pete's (Sandich vs. Sandiche) gift to Dorinda Durston (same in both) with Al Yackey (same in both) present is almost identical. The first lines in Heaven are the same, though the heavenly figure is played by Lionell Barrymore in A Guy Named Joe. It goes on and on, but I found Spielberg's version more moving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a ghost story without special effects and an adventure movie with no bad guys. It's kind of sappy and it is a remake of another movie. Yet somehow it manages to transcend all of that. There is something about this movie that just makes me want to watch it over and over again. Every character is thoroughly believable emotionally. And what's more every motivation they display comes from love. There are so many kinds of love in this movie. The love friends share, the love lovers share, the heartbreak of loss, the wonder of new discovery and the greatest love of all: The love by sacrifice where someone would lay down his life for another. It's a date movie, a family movie, a comedy, a tragedy and adventure. It's credentials cannot be disputed. Actors like Holly Hunter, Richard Dreyfuss and John Goodman; Director Steven Spielberg; Score by John Williams and everything else is top notch. If you want to laugh, if you want to cry, If you have ever lost the one you love - see this movie. Heck if you just want to kill some time in a quality fashion, see this movie. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoyed this movie thoroughly. Had everything that one would want in a movie. Action, romance, comedy. A great cast that really made you feel for the characters. Dreyfuss as the romantic, swashbuckling lead was very enjoyable and the comedic relationship with John Goodman was delightful. Holly Hunter showed a great range with her character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable but Speilberg overdoes the sentiment till it's sickly sweet instead of moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pete Sandich is a aerial fire fighter. When he is killed he leaves behind friends and a girlfriend, Dorinda. However his ghost lives on with them and he struggles to see her fall in love with his replacement. He remains unseen but is able to influence what goes on around him and must learn to cope with his loss.Having just seen the older Speilberg working on Minority Report and fudging the end with his usual sentiment it makes you realise how far he has come since 1989. I say that because Always is one of the films where the sentiment is too heavily laid on and spoils the film. The plot is one seen many times before but it could have been a moving story of lost love but it's made too sweet.The comedy is good and the plot is enjoyable (as it was the first time round) and it is easy to get sucked into b the emotion. However Speilberg and Williams always suffer with the one main failing ? they push it too far and force the sentiment down our throats. Despite this I still enjoyed the film but the line between being moving and being sickly sweet is crossed too often for my liking.Dreyfuss is good but is guilty of pushing over that line himself ? but for most he is very watchable. Hunter is also good as the object of two men's affection and the support cast are all very good in their own ways ? Goodman, Hepburn, Helgenberger etc.Overall I enjoyed this and in no way it is the worse thing Speilberg has done. However his usual failing of overdoing the sentiment is evident here and spoils what could have been a very moving film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing Steven Spielberg's Always with a lot of anticipation.And walking out disappointed.Other than being dazzled by the sheer loveliness of Holly Hunter (looking breathtaking in a sprayed-on white dress), I seem to remember Always being very forced and formulaic, a brazen attempt to twang your heartstrings--that means you, mister, so you'd better get weepy! Like ET, Always is incredibly manipulative and cold-hearted underneath the surface. This is another movie where I walked out feeling irritable and embarrassed, p.o.'d because I couldn't criticize the movie without getting yelled at for being a cynical jerk and feeling as if Spielberg had been trying to cinematically tongue my ear to get a primal response, a weepy blubber out of me.Yech.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg Directs Audrey Hepburn In Her Final Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Always (1989): Starring Richard Dreyfuss, Holly Hunter, Brad Johnson, , John Goodman, Roberts Blossom, Keith David, Ed Van Nuys, Marg Helgenberger, Dale Dye, Brian Haley, Kim Robillard, James Lashly, Michael Steve Jones, Jim Sparkman, Doug McGrath, Shereil L. Bowens, DeMarious T. Morgafield, Todd Jacobson, Mike O'Neal, Larry Landless, Steve Shatnyski, Joseph McCrossin, J.D. Souther, David Jackson, David Kitay, Gene Strimling, Roy E. Harrison, Ted Grossman, Loren Smothers...Director Steven Spielberg...Screenplay Jerry Belson, Frederick Hazlit Brennan.The 80's was a prosperous time for director Steven Spielberg. Already under his belt were the successful films- Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, E.T. and I mention those because, like "Always" they deal with the supernatural and their influence on the more commonly incredulous and unimaginative modern world. "Always" was never a memorable or even "great" Spielberg movie. Audiences were quick to point out how it was an altered adaptation of the 1940's film "A Guy Named Joe". But this movie has many strong moments and works its magic over you in so many ways. Not only does it boast superb visual effects and cinematography by Mikael Salomon, but the cast of actors are doing a top-notch job. In a minor but significant role is an elderly Audrey Hepburn, approaching 90 and this was to be her last film. She was working for UNICEF and after a trip to Africa, died of cancer in early 1993. Richard Dreyfuss stars as firefighter pilot Peter Sandich. He is madly in love with the beautiful and supportive Dorinda Durston (Holly Hunter), but is also competing against another suitor- firefighter pilot Ted Baker. In the role of Peter's loyal buddy Al is John Goodman. During a dangerous mission, Peter's plane bursts into flames and he dies, although he does not know it. Before long, the angel "Hap" (Audrey Hepburn) tells him he is officially dead but has been granted the privilege of looking after his loved ones. He must endure watching Ted make the moves on Dorinda whom he eventually marries. Through it all, Hap offers him words of widsdom and emotional support. Like many of Spielberg's films, this one is charged with emotion and human drama. This sense of human suffering, longing and tristesse is further accentuated by the powerful musical score by John Williams. While many don't care for this film and it has somehow faded into forgetfulness, it's a great picture. Audrey Hepburn is wonderful in this film, providing a young generation (who grew up in the 80's) with the chance to see her in a film while she was still breathing. But the brains behind her casting is Spielberg, who was smart enough to pull her out of retirement for one final film, even when she was not in the best of health. It is ironic how in the film her character is a white-clad angel and associated with the theme of death and the afterlife when her time on earth was going to be over only two years after this film was released. Spielberg's strength lies not only in perfect casting but in the nearly natural ability to tell a good story on film. Even if this is what many consider a re-make of Hollywood's "A Guy Named Joe" (which was more comedy than drama or love story) this version is stronger and more complex than the original. I loved this film and hope that you can give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's kinda neat!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One day, this movie was on and nobody was watching it but a few of us pay a little attention to it and watched the whole thing. It was kinda neat! Though it was kinda boring, you know it wasn't my type of style. But it was kinda fun! It starred Holly Hunter, John Goodman and Richard Dreyfus.It's about Richard Dreyfus as a fire-fighter Cessna pilot who dies before he could ever express his love for his fellow Cessna pilot played by Holly Hunter. If you don't know, a Cessna is like a miniature airplane, so there. But he returns as a ghost and follows her around. He sees her go through hardships and sometimes he gets jealous himself because men start to flirt with her since he's gone. But some points, he wishes he could give her some advice.You probably know that this movie was made by the famous Steven Spielberg. So, no wonder I got so pulled in when I watched it by, you could say, accident. Whoever likes these actors and actresses and likes Spielberg's films ought to see this one?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BEST love story ever filmed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie for more than 40 times, and each time I find something marvelous to talk about, From my opinion, This is the best romantic movie ever filmed, The best thing in this movie is its simplicity, if you compare it to "Love story" and "Ghost" you will see how simple this movie is, let's take this example: - the death of Richard Dreyfuss, it was so simple, Mr. Spielberg didn't show woman crying and people dying, in Ghost the death was a special scene, and in love story it was a very big scene. - Mr. Spielberg did not use any special effects like Ghost to prove that Dreyfuss is dead, like walking through people , or being invisible, or broking things?!! Although he knows how to use it well, but intentionally he didn't use it, because he wants people to concentrate on the story, on the acting, on the scenes?etc Lets go back to acting, of course Holly Hunter was great, for me, I nominate her to the best actress in this movie, again she is so simple and so real, with her you never feel she is acting,?. See how she climbs the plane ladder and how she rides the bicycle, Although it is a simple movie, but Spielberg was not limited in filming the fire fighting scenes perfect, as always known about him, the plans and the fire scenes was excellent One of the best scenes on this movie when Dreyfuss was giving Holly Hunter the dress, this whole scene must be studied, it is so good and again so simple. The colors and lighting of this movie is so effecting and so touching, the directing is perfect, Mr. Spielberg proves in this movie that he is not only a sci-fiction director, ?but he is a great director for any kind of movies.. John Goodman was perfect and Richard Dreyfuss was so good in this role, I can't imagine any other actor in this place, this group of three, ..try to imagine any other actor here, the picture will be ruined. I don't know why some are criticizing this movie, I can't forget the first time I watch it on Theatre, it was an experience that I will never forget, the first time feeling is unbelievable, you can't describe how much feelings and emotions you have, ?just .."Perfect.."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting moments amid the flames</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this film was based on a story called "A Guy named Joe". I like that title better than "Always" which refers to never-ending love. This is certainly a love story, but it cannot claim to be original in its ideas. You'll liken it to "Ghost" or, if you go further back, to Noel Coward's "Blithe Spirit". This film is not as good as either of those.Don't let me put you off this film. It is worth seeing if only for the fire fighting scenes. Planes racing at top neck speed clipping the tops of forest trees all exploding in raging fires are some of the best action scenes I have seen in years. I understand that archival footage of past forest fires are used together with studio special effects. "Special" is the word. The result is truly amazing as you watch planes flying through flames.The love story could have a little more fire in it, although it does improve over time.I cannot quite accept the character that Audrey Hepburn plays. She appears a couple of times but the scenes could be left out without affecting the film in any way.The film does acknowledge the bravery of those men and women who fight fires from the skies. In a war situation they would all earn numerous medals for bravery, but as fire fighters (You've guessed it!) they're only doing their job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie! It will always have a special place in my heart. I like the "Pete Sandich" Richard Dreyfuss (Mr. Holland's Opus, The Competition, and so on). Pete reminded me a lot of my husband Alex as he teases "Dorinda Durston" Holly Hunter (The Piano) unmercifully. I love the theme song. Steven Spielberg "ET, "Schindler's List" was the director and I believe that he is one of the greatest directors of the turn of the century. Books will be written about his work forever. He is one of those people that his work will be taught in film schools around the world. "Al Yackey" John Goodman (The Flintstones) is just so cute, and big like a big teddy bear. He is so flexible! The story is very sweet, and many movies have been made on this topic that are sad, but this one is funny! Like "Dona Flor. and Two Husbands" it has its sad parts but after all you will not feel down. It is an uplifting story dealing with the after life. "Hap" Audrey Hepburn ( Breakfast at Tiffany's) was just great. Favorite Scenes: Dorinda and Pete dancing after she gave her that beautiful dress. Favorite quotes: Dorinda Durston: "He's too beautiful. He's too much twisted steel and sex appeal. I can't be with a guy that looks like I won him in a raffle." I recommend this movie! It is really great!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake, sorta, of A Guy Named Joe. I loved it because it is a sentimental story of a passionate, if flawed, love relationship between a risk taker and his headstrong gal, which then demonstrates that one may love again after the loss of "true love". Watch it if you ever feel that love is lost and depression is looming. The fire/flames imagery is a good symbol for the phoenix...rebirth...renewal. I found it uplifting (John Goodman is great, by the way)in showing that life goes on and can be great again. P.S. I like anything with Holly Hunter in it; her southern "lisp" makes any movie worth watching--even "The Incredibles" if you are not a cartoon fan.</fullReview>
