		<shortDescription>Charisse is a bonus to any film, a compliment of any arm, a true gem...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cyd Charisse, along with Vera-Ellen and Ann Miller, was one of the premier dancing stars of the 1940's and 1950's...Known for her cool sex appeal, Cyd Charisse has a beautiful face, a perfect figure, and a thrilling musicality... She is the American cinema's lyrical dancing beauty with a lovely flow of movements and crystalline footwork, a bonus to any film, a compliment of any arm, a true gem... The sensitivity and eloquence of character she projects as a dancer found great echo in her roles as an acclaimed ballerina capable of expressing herself to the entire audience with a flick of the wrist, tapering her high extensions into a musical phrase like a painter controlling a fine sable brush...When she danced 'La Bamba' and 'Flaming Flamenco' with Ricardo Montalban in Richard Thorpe's "Fiesta," she excelled in technical dynamics... But in 'Broadway Rhythm Ballet,' number from "Singin' in the Rain," Stanley Donen's camera followed the leg up to the figure of a seductive Dancer, a gangster's moll: Charisse was beautiful, bewitching exotic nightclub performer and city vamp, teasing Gene Kelly by balancing his straw hat on the end of her foot, and leaving us all breathless...In 'Silk Stockings' she is a humorless, unromantic and cold, a seriously-austere Russian envoy who is sent from Moscow to check three Russian emissaries who, in turn, have orders to bring back with them a Soviet composer about to lend his talents to an American movie producer...A 'beautiful dynamite,' Charisse warms to the appeal of romance, and Fred Astaire, to luxury, jazz, and French champagne... The chemistry was there when they danced the 'Paris Loves Lovers,' number in which the suave Astaire awakens her interest in life and the City of lights, but in the title song where she throws off her cold uniform for her first fine pair of silk stockings and laces, Charisse, (the very serious and dedicated Ninotchka), turns into an explosion of talent and glamor, with the qualities of a scintillating star, radiantly charming and sweet, filling the screen with bravura, energy and spark... Peter Lorre, Jules Munshin and Joseph Buloff are the three Kremlin agents, the trio of 'clowns' who become fond of freedom and the pleasures of Paris...Janis Paige is delightfully amusing as the temperamental movie star for whom producer Astaire was preparing a musical about Napoleon and Josephine... 'Silk Stockings' has definite virtues, the foremost being Fred Astaire... Although worried about being ageless for the role, Astaire sings 'All of You' to Charisse with all of his old ardent feelings, dances beautifully with her in a deserted movie studio to 'Fated to Be Mated,' and joins Janis Paige, playing 'America's Swimming Sweetheart,' in Cole Porter's delicious 'Stereophonic Sound.' His solo to 'The Ritz Roll 'n' Rock,' in which he wears his trademarked top hat and tails, is a proof of his grace, sophistication and talent... For all its merits, Mamoulian's 'Silk Stockings' has a degree of elegance and sophistication, but mostly a sweet sadness, the end of a living legend, in which Fred Astaire appears in his last great musical role...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Silk Stockings" is something of an enigma. Its release came at the moment much of America had switched over to viewing television and the musical film was dying. But it was still glorious. I couldn't care less about the 'outdated Red Russia' story line; this is a remake of a 1939 film and the USSR conflict was in the original as well. What're you gonna do? The main focus is on capitalist seduction- first by Tobias, Munshin, and Peter Lorre, then most beautifully by Astaire and Charisse. Note that in their first duet (the non-dancing "Paris Loves Lovers"), as they sing in perfect counterpoint, they appear to be undressing each other with their eyes. Later, in "All of You," the gloves come off and our two leads seduce each other through a most graceful dance in a living room. Astaire was 56 years old, Charisse was about 36, and there is still more electricity in their pairing than in some of the downright silly things passing as romantic comedies today. The undisputed highlight of the film is Ms. Charisse in a silent and sensuous expression of terpsichory as she puts on nude stockings, a camisole, and a flared transparent slip. OMG!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now on DVD - CinemaScope once more!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like so many films produced in the mid- to late Fifties and early Sixties, when CinemaScope and other widescreen processes enhanced a production, directors and cinematographers were usually unafraid to take full advantage of the wider ratio. They weren't so concerned about how the final product would look on TV's square screens and probably didn't anticipate the visual desecration of "formatting" and "pan-and-scan" reductions. So it's nice to know that this musical, filmed when M-G-M was about to throw in the musical towel and bid an undeserved farewell to the Arthur Freed "unit," can now be enjoyed again close to its original theatrical aspect ratio on DVD.Astaire and Charisse are a team to be treasured (so wonderful together in "The Band Wagon" a few years earlier, under Minnelli's astute guidance) and all of the others listed in this film's credits are professionals of the highest caliber. Astaire has a fun solo (with a chorus of top-hatted dancers) in the "Ritz Roll 'n' Rock" number; Cyd gets to put those legendary legs to dazzlingly opulent use in the "Red Blues" production show-stopper; and even Janis Paige gets to raunch it up in an amusing example of clever Cole Porter risking something risqué (for its day) in a song about the Empress Josephine, "commonly known as Jo"! And there's that first reel number, "Stere-oh-phonic Sound," that cleverly spoofs the contemporary moviemakers' attempts to lure people from their TV sets with widescreens, sound coming from every corner of the auditorium and eye-glazing color processes. It may not be prime Porter but it's all far-and-away more fun and enjoyable than anything we're likely to get today with the threatened revival of the movie musical with barbarians like Baz Luhrmann given the directorial reins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Glorious Technicolor and Cinemascope and STEREOPHONIC SOUND</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is Cole Porter meeting Ernst Lubitsch's best recalled film, NINOTCHKA. Up-dated to be sure, but still an affective comedy about rival systems of politics, social structure, and economics.In the original, a Soviet economic mission is trying to use some jewelry that was originally owned by a Grand Duchess to purchase needed agricultural equipment. This is jettisoned in the new version. Fred Astaire (Steve Canfield) is a movie producer who is planning a production of WAR AND PEACE with Janis Paige as his star (she is Peggy Dayton, a noted Hollywood swim star, a la Esther Williams), who will play the Empress Josephine. Interesting point: Josephine does not appear in WAR AND PEACE - keep that in mind. Canfield wants to have a score by Russia's leading composer, Peter Ilyitsch Boroff (Wim Sonneveld) who is currently in Paris with a culture mission that is under Jules Munshin, Peter Lorre, and Alexander Granach. Their boss, George Tobias (promoted since NINOTCHKA - he's now a commissar) sends Cyd Charisse (Ninotchka Yoschencko) to keep the other three and Boroff under control. Tobias has reason to be upset. Not only is Canfield trying to corrupt the culture mission (not too difficult there) but also Boroff, who falls for Peggy Dayton (as Canfield hopes).It follows closely the pursuit and "corruption" of Ninotchka, but there is one aspect that is shown here that was barely touched upon in the 1939 film. There Swanna's cynical use of the jewelry as a bargaining chip to keep Leon from Ninotchka sort of suggests that pure capitalism has it's drawbacks when in the wrong hands. In SILK STOCKINGS it is the cavalier use of culture for a fast buck that gets a go over.Boroff's masterpiece is called "Overture to a tractor", but Canfield has it changed into a song for Peggy "Jo,Jo, Jo, Jo, Josephine...commonly called Jo". Whatever one thinks of music in honor of inanimate objects, Boroff's work represents serious art. Ninotchka and the others (including Boroff) are furious, and dismiss the glib excuse Steve comes up with (many other popular songs are based on classic tunes). They leave for Russia, and the rest of the musical follows Steve's attempts (like Leon's before him) to get Ninotchka back.The Porter score here (with the score for CAN-CAN) were the last two really first rate scores Porter composed, but both were composed for the stage productions of the musicals and transposed to the screen. Here the title song (originally sung by Don Ameche on stage, but here by Astaire) is one of the best numbers, as is "Glorious Technicolor", where Astaire and Paige describe all the cinematography gimmicks used to draw in the audience (leading up to "sterophonic sound", which the film sound track blasts out). Munchkin, Lorre, and Granach have two big numbers, the second (SIBERIA) being one of Porter's best comic pieces as the three culture mission people look gloomily to returning to Russia, and possibly being sent to Siberia ("Have you seen our choice bill of fare...Please try the fillet of polar bear!"). There is even a second piece by "Boroff" composed in Russia, "I've got the Red Blues!" which uses forbidden rock and roll.If it does not have the fine Lubitsch elegance and "touch", SILK STOCKINGS still shows a first rate handling on it's own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Musicals die in style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fred Astaire has always been a performer who's work is very close to my heart. The last real Fred Astaire movie (excluding his geriatric non-singing, non-dancing or non-starring roles) is 1957's "Silk Stockings".I was a little afraid to watch Silk Stockings at first. Sure, it had a Cole Porter score supervised by Andre Previn, and Hermes Pan choreography, and, sure, Fred made fabulous movies even at that age ("the Bandwagon", "Daddy Long Legs"), but I knew it was Fred's last, and I didn't want to know why. Now I know what a pleasure I was depriving myself of."Silk Stockings" is a musical remake of "Ninotchka", a 1939 Greta Garbo picture. It's about a serious stern young Russian woman, sent as an envoy to nab a Russian composer living illegally in Paris. The composer is betraying his Russian classical heritage by writing music for a low brow movie musical. The director of this movie, played by Fred Astaire, distracts the pretty young Russian (Cyd Charisse) with the wonders of Paris, classy night clubs, and dancing to jazz. In falling for him, her strict heartless personality melts away.This movie was produced at the height of the cold war, and the height of Hollywood blacklisting, and it's commie-bashing could make some uncomfortable. To me, those jokes are anything but propaganda. The cultural stereotypes are played for laughs, and should be taken with a grain of salt. Of course, I'm a big fan of the top hat and tails ritzy romantic culture that Astaire's character teaches Charisse's character the joys of, so it's easy for me to say.With the exception of the classics "All of You" and "Paris is For Lovers", Cole Porter's songs are comic, here. But, that being said, they are hilarious. This was towards the end of Porter's career too. In fact, this was towards the end of the movie musical as America knew it.Rock and Roll was taking over. To me, the most moving moments in this movie are not the dramatic love scenes shared by Astaire and Charisse, they are the self referential moments, where Porter, Astaire, and choreographer Hermes Pan acknowledge that their era in over.Porter wrote special material just for this movie. One highlight is a tune called "Stereophonic Sound". In it, the singer quips about how moviegoers used to be content to see talented performers do their thing, and a nice love story, but these days all they want is "glorious Technicolor, breathtaking CinemaScope, and Stereophonic sound!" The song puts down all the gimmickry of the modern Hollywood, and even has one verse quite obviously about Fred Astaire himself. Porter writes that these days a great hoofer in tails is not enough, they want a ballet (alluding to Gene Kelly's ballet dance number fad).Fred Astaire's last MGM dance number is to the song "Ritz Rollin' Rock". It's Porter's parody of this new music called Rock and Roll, ironically borrowing from Irving Berlin's dated "Puttin' On the Ritz". This sequence, choreographed by Astaire's long-time collaborator Hermes Pan, ends with Fred writhing on the floor, wearing his 1930's tails and top hat. As the horns hit the last big chord, Fred removes his trade-marked top hat and smashes it flat with his fist. The message Porter, Astaire and Pan slipped into this novelty number, is very powerful, if you know what you're seeing.Pop entertainment changed in the sixties, and the the old kings abdicated their thrones to... well... the King, I suppose.Anyway, if you're a Fred-head like me, and you're afraid to see Fred's final fling, "Silk Stockings", don't be. You'll be reminded why he and his period of Hollywood was great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By no means a miss, but not exactly a smash hit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a number of good things about Silk Stockings, but there also is a professional finality about the movie that makes it easier to observe than to be delighted by it. It was one of the last of the big MGM musicals coming from Arthur Freed's production unit. It was the last musical Fred Astaire made as the lead. It was the last film directed by Rouben Mamoulian. It was based on the last Broadway musical Cole Porter wrote. Silk Stockings also was used to make a statement about the excesses some thought were ruining films and music...the advent of rock and roll and the technological changes in films with wide screen and stereo sound. It even takes a crack at the fashion for ballet in many musicals. You've got to be very clever and original to successfully parody things which are already self-parodies. Silk Stockings, even with its many entertaining moments, isn't that clever. The story is based on Ninotchka, the female Soviet commissar who comes to Paris and finds romance reluctantly...and then enthusiastically. Paris is presented as a place where decadence was never more innocent and persuasive. One of the things that seems so odd is that, for a Fred Astaire film, Astaire spends a good deal of time doing knee drops, full-length on-the-floor sprawls and athletic dance moves that limit the sophisticated and smooth Astaire style. He was 59 when he made the picture, and this might explain the relative shortness of some of the sequences. Still, while he is assured and immensely watchable (and while he can still do wonders with a cane), three major dance productions he is in just seem choppy. Most of the songs from the Broadway show were retained and Porter wrote a couple of new ones. It's become routine with Porter to say that whatever his latest show was, the score was never one of his best. In this case, it's true. The romantic songs are great, but the topical specialty numbers just seem tired. Siberia and The Ritz Roll and Rock in particular miss the mark, in my opinion.Astaire, as always, is first class. Charisse is easy to look at and a fine dancer. George Tobias, as a commissar in Moscow and Ninotchka's boss, gives a sly and dead-pan performance. Some of Porter's songs are very good. Mamoulian brought the film in on time and under budget. And Silk Stockings was a success with ticket buyers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smooth as silk musical and great pairing of Astaire and Charisse...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of humor at the expense of the Soviets (natch) is present throughout this musical version of "Ninotchka" in which Greta Garbo was the Russian who melts into a normal woman thanks to the spell of capitalism. Here it's CYD CHARISSE who plays the very uptight lady (with a stiffness that comes naturally to Cyd who could play an "ice princess" with the best of them). And FRED ASTAIRE is thankfully cast as an American film producer hoping to get her cooperation in borrowing a Soviet composer for his new film.That's the nuts and bolts of the story, but the ingredients (including a trio of Soviet agents played by PETER LORRE, JULES MUNSHIN and Joseph BULOFF and a ditsy American singer/actress JANET PAIGE), are enough to stir up a lot of sardonic humor and some really good song and dance numbers. Paige is especially good with her "Stereophonic Sound" routine and "Satin and Silk", flirtatious and vivacious as ever in a top supporting role.But it's the dance elements that count here--Astaire at his most elegant and Cyd Charisse gracefully matching him step by step all the way through. Her performance as the serious minded miss who gradually bends to his ways is one of her better contributions to film comedy.Summing up: A delightful blend of Cole Porter songs and a clever script make this one a sheer pleasure, smooth as silk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a senior I'll make a couple of stock comments; "They don't make em like this anymore and " Pop culture of the 50's in the USA was artful and demanded talent. Beautiful and sensuous Cyd Charisse and "All Pro" musical dancer Fred Astaire team up wonderfully to update and old story put to music. The settings are lush and the dancing is suberp. Peter Lorre and Janis Paige add the right touch of humor and talent. Although much of the "Cold War" lingo seemed corny, if you were an adult at the time this movie was made, you'll find it hillarious but so true. All said and done, it is a pleasureable treat!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After an adaption to Broadway as the final stage musical of Cole Porter's career, Ernest Lubitsch's acclaimed film Ninotchka, now Silk Stockings is getting its film treatment. Silk Stockings ran for 478 performances on Broadway in the 1955-1956 season and starred Don Ameche and Hildegarde Neff in the roles originally played by Melvyn Douglas and Greta Garbo.For reasons I don't understand Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder's names are not given credit here. I distinctly heard a lot of lines from the original Ninotchka that came from them. I also heard some of the acid barbs of George S. Kaufman who worked with Abe Burrows on the book for Silk Stockings.Most of Cole Porter's score makes it intact to the screen, but since the male and female leads were now dancers, Porter wrote Fated To Be Mated and The Ritz Roll and Rock for Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse. The latter is one of my favorite Astaire numbers from his film. Porter who was no mean satirist himself was having a bit of fun at the new trend in music called Rock and Roll in a spoof of Rock Around the Clock.The plot from the original Ninotchka was changed and updated from the time of the pre-World War II Soviet Union of Stalin to the Cold War. Commissar Ninotchka is no longer concerned with selling jewels of the former nobility, she's negotiating with an American producer who wants a famous Russian composer to score his film adaption of War and Peace. Curiously enough War and Peace did make it to the screen the previous year.Astaire as the producer also has a sexy, but very tough minded star in Janis Paige to contend with. Janis has her moments on screen with the song Josephine and singing and dancing with Astaire in Stereophonic Sound. The big hit song from the score, All of You is sung and danced elegantly by Fred and Cyd. As usual Cyd's vocals were dubbed in this case by Carole Richards who used to be a regular for a while on Bing Crosby's radio show.Peter Lorre, Jules Munshin, and Alexander Granach are the three commissars who Ninotchka has to bail out as in the original film. Granach repeats his role from Ninotchka. But George Tobias sets a record as the only player to appear in both film and the Broadway version. In the original Ninotchka he was the Soviet Embassy Official who balks at granting Melvyn Douglas a visa. On stage and on screen he plays the boss of Garbo/Neff/Charisse, a part that was done in the original Ninotchka by Bela Lugosi.The comedy is a lot more broad than in the Lubitsch film, but with that Cole Porter music and the charm and dancing of Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse, Silk Stockings is a film you should not miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Astaire too old! Gimme a break. He danced with a polish that was always present. Charisse should have been grateful for his presence and I suspect that she was.A characiture of the USSR and America of the Cold War period? Yes indeed, and it was almost as good as "One, Two, Three" in its dialogue and situation. Its sensuality as presented in its dance numbers far exceeded the 1939 version and all comers of the same subject.I had no problem watching a 56 year old Astaire romancing a 36 year old Charisse. As a matter of fact, I found the pair quite sensuous.I have often wondered why in the final dance scene Cyd's costume skirt was switched to a cullote in the middle of the scene. The switch was not seamless as it was very noticeable.But, all in all I give this delightful musical a rating of 8 on a 0 to 10 scale.Dave</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Most Fitting Tribute to Charisse's Terpsichorean Talents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the passing of Cyd Charisse last week at age 86, it's worth seeking out what is probably her finest work on celluloid. As an actress, she was bland. As a singer, she was dubbed (this time by the sonorous-sounding Carole Richards). But as a dancer, she was extraordinary. Along with Vera-Ellen, the ballet-trained Charisse was in the top echelon of the female dancers MGM showcased during the studio's golden years of which this film is one of its final stops. The clearest evidence of this claim can be found in the title tune when she dances with beauty and precision elegantly changing from her drab street clothes into silk and satin. It's a remarkable number, no small feat since her co-star is Fred Astaire. Directed by early musical maven Rouben Mamoulian in what turned out to be his last film, the movie also marks Astaire's swan song as a musical comedy leading man. Symbolically, he smashes his top hat at the end of his final solo number, "The Ritz Roll and Rock". The wear barely shows in his dancing where he pulls off some of his most acrobatic numbers, but other than the professionalism of the two leads, the inspiration seems sadly missing.The film is a partial remake of Ernst Lubitsch's 1939 classic comedy, "Ninotchka" - in fact, some scenes are repeated verbatim - although certain elements have been altered to accommodate Cole Porter's musical score. This musical translation first showed up on Broadway two years earlier, but further revisions have obviously been made to tailor the story to the dancing talents of the leads. Charisse has the unenviable task of stepping into Greta Garbo's shoes as top Soviet envoy Ninotchka Yoschenko, who is sent to Paris to retrieve three lesser envoys swept up by the City of Lights. They had already botched their mission to lure famous Russian composer Peter Boroff back to the mother country. At the same time, American movie producer Steve Canfield wants Boroff to score his next picture, a musical bowdlerization of Tolstoy's "War and Peace" starring comically curvaceous Peggy Dayton, a parody of an Esther Williams-style swimming star whose been in the pool too long. As Dayton uses her feminine wiles to entice Boroff, Canfield tries to seduce Ninotchka, a far frostier proposition though the eventual thawing is inevitable. Porter's music has that effect or so we are led to believe.Playing another variation on the worldly photographer he played in the same year's "Funny Face", Astaire is still at the top of his game, but his dance numbers are less elegant and appear markedly shorter than usual here. Charisse cannot compare to the legendary Garbo when it comes to line readings as a stoic communist. However, her dancing truly transcends ? not only the title tune but also "The Red Blues", an impressive ensemble number showcasing Charisse in a variety of dance styles, and the two duets with Astaire to "All of You" - the first a romantic defrosting of Ninotchka and the second a jauntier, rhythmic pas-de-deux. I wish the rest of the film was as good, but sadly, the energy wavers and the pacing flags during its 117-minute running time. The rest of the cast is serviceable, in particular, Janis Paige on familiar ground as Peggy (nicely paired with Astaire on the energetically cynical "Stereophonic Sound") and George Tobias as the deadpan Soviet commissar. Peter Lorre ("M") and Jules Munshin (Ozzie in "On the Town") show up as two of the bumbling envoys. The 2003 DVD has some interesting extras beginning with a ten-minute featurette featuring a 2003 interview with the still-elegant Charisse in "Cole Porter in Hollywood: Satin and Silk". Because of the Porter tie-in, there is also a 1934 Bob Hope short, "Paree, Paree", a silly musical comedy with Hope wooing singer Dorothy Stone. Also included is the original theatrical trailer, as well as "Poet and Peasant Overture" with Alfred Wallenstein conducting the MGM symphony orchestra playing the Franz Von Suppe piece as an overture to the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cole Porter musical with the songs intact!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been quite a few Cole Porter musicals transplanted from Broadway to Hollywood film, but, they usually lose the Cole Porter songs in the process. Silk Stockings is one of the few which made it to the silver screen with the great music and lyrics of Porter intact.Silk Stockings is a joyous musical version of the Garbo film Ninotchka.The stars, Fred Astaire, Cyd Charise and Janis Page shine. The singing and dancing are superb.Watch for the dance sequence with Fred and Cyd where her skirt magically changes from a plain skirt, to one with a pleat in the middle to kulots and then back to a skirt with a pleat. It is one of the most incredible edit jobs on film, totally seamless.All in all this is one of the best of the MGM musicals.Silk Stockings is an all around great musical film. I doubt you will be unable to hum Stereophonic Sound for days after viewing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The usual lavish MGM treatment is given to Cole Porter's version of the cold war farce "Ninotchka", producing a film more entertaining than Billy Wilder's original. The music is good, particularly the ballads, though some of the more upbeat songs definately suffer from a lack of originality. Lorre and company are engaging as the Soviets sent to bring back Russia's famous composer. Charisse is the "special envoy" -- she does a fine job, showing herself as one of Astaire's most talented co-stars. Astaire is doing a good job as usual. Nice direction by somebody besides Minnelli in the Freed camp for a change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"We got da Red Blues!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clever, witty and charming musical, courtesy M.G.M. and the Arthur Freed unit, of which this was one of their last films. One of several musical remakes (of non-musical pictures) that the studio produced in the mid-late 1950s. This is one of the best.Fred Astaire plays his usual character, the playboy-ish bachelor, in this case a film producer, wanting to use a Russian composer's music for his new film. Cyd Charisse plays Ninotchka, the Russian woman who comes to Paris to bring back the composer and three comrades who failed to return him to his native land. As the three comrades, Jules Munshin, Peter Lorre (holding onto a chair as he dances), and Joseph Buloff are a hoot, adding good comic relief in their "Too Bad" and "Siberia" numbers. Janis Paige is a jewel as the ditzy actress hired for the new film. She radiates with Astaire in the memorable "Stereophonic Sound" number, as well as in her own hilarious "Satin and Silk".Charisse, (whose wooden acting is OK here), is lovely as usual and has a few excellent dances, including the sensual "All of You" (with Astaire), the lively "Red Blues", and the stunning ballet where she removes her old Russian garb, for her new Parisian silks. This was the second of her two pairings with Astaire, and though this is not the gem that "The Band Wagon" is, it still sparkles nonetheless.A clever and classy musical, with some very topical humor. Great songs by Cole Porter (with the exception of the tacky "Ritz, Roll and Rock"...a poor punch at rock and roll). Excellent use of color and the Cinemascope frame help to make this one of the last great musicals of the 1950s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silk Stockings DVD has some fun extras</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As "Silk Stockings" reaches the half-century mark, it is now so dated that it can be enjoyed either as a period piece, as a look at popular attitudes toward the Cold War, as a rather silly but enjoyable setting for the odd couple of Cyd Charisse and Fred Astaire, or as a chance to see character actors like Jules Munchin and Peter Lorre. You know it's an old movie when Technicolor and stereophonic sound are being touted as the new big things! Whether you like the main movie or not, the DVD extras have their own charm. The Special Features section includes a short film with Cyd Charisse as narrator, made about 2003, in which she talks about Cole Porter, Fred Astaire, and how the film came to be. Another short b/w film from the thirties is called "Paree, Paree". This one stars a very young Bob Hope, and features Cole Porter songs from the musical "20 Million Frenchmen".Another musical treat is the "Poet and Peasant Overture", written by Franz von Suppe, played by the full studio orchestra. Both the 'Paree' film and this overture will tease you with musical strains familiar to those of us who grew up with old cartoons, so be warned! Listening to this music may induce animation flashback.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Silk Stockings "v. "Ninotchka"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the occasion recently to see "Silk Stockings" and "Ninotchka" back to back. While the musical (and its Broadway antecedent) is based upon the general plot line of the famous Greta Garbo comedy----each film can fully stand on its own to critical judgment."Ninotchka" is considered a classic by many people, and contains Garbo's first comic performance. It is also one of her most accessible roles as well as her penultimate film appearance. Acting styles have changed considerably over the years, and contemporary film-goers may be somewhat mystified as to why she was so highly regarded in her time. However in "Ninotchka," she created a character that is almost free of the mannerisms and affectations often found in her serious movies that turn off so many of today's viewers. The Lubitsch "touch?" Perhaps."Silk Stockings" may not be a classic, but it's a delightful and enjoyable musical film entertainment. It is interesting that in the year 1957, we saw the last traditional film musical from both Fred Astaire ("Silk Stockings")and Gene Kelly ("Les Girls") as well as "Silk Stockings" being the last film directed by the legendary Rouben Mamoulian. Coincidentally, Mamoulian directed one of Garbo's most highly regarded films----"Queen Christina" back in 1933.The recent death of Cyd Charisse reminds us of what a great artist she was in her prime musical years. And while Fred Astaire may have done better work in many of his earlier films, he left the musical genre (excluding the forgettable "Finian's Rainbow") with a stylish, charming and endearing performance.Personally, I find the character played by Astaire considerably more likable than the one dimensional cad-lover played in the earlier film by Melvyn Douglas. And while Cyd Charisse never was considered much of an actress, her stone-faced Bolshevik who is seduced and in turn warmed by Western "decadence" compares favorably with Garbo's Ninotchka---plus she can dance! What an understatement! "Silk Stockings" is an underrated film from the Golden Age of musicals. Fred Astaire left to go on to other projects---and it could be argued that his several subsequent television specials with Barrie Chase extended his classic dancing work. But "Silk Stockings" is his last great role as a song and dance man. What a way to go!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very good musical starring Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse. Russia wants their top composer back and sends spies to get him back. A good plot!Although some say that Astaire is too old for the part, he handles the role very well. His dancing, singing and acting are still wonderful!Charisse is good as the Russian Spy. With a few elegant dances in it, Charisse is in her element in this film. Her wood-like acting, as some say, comes in handy.It also starrs Wim Sonneveld in his first (and last) big Hollywood film, in the role of the Russian composer. He handles the role beautifully with a touch of zanyness, or as he liked to say "mesjogge". Sonneveld had only done theater work before that and one Dutch film. As a comedian, he liked the role very much, it fitted him. It's only too sad it didn't get him the break-through he wanted.I give this film a 9/10! The good cast, plot and songs make the movie an all-time classic! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Teaming an on-form Fred Astaire and the lovely Cyd Charisse, supported by Janis Paige, Peter Lorre, and others, this musical adaptation of the famous 30s Garbo vehicle, 'Ninotchka', shines out right at the end of the golden era of screen song and dance movies.Cyd looks the part and she and Fred have some marvellous dance numbers, as well as the repartee kept in from the original film. Janis Paige is particularly good in the mickey-take 'Stereophonic Sound' (because, of course, this Ninotchka version is based around, yep, putting on a show). The other fun to be had is in seeing Peter Lorre in a musical number. Priceless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lackluster swan song for Astaire and Charisse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is quite obviously a "book" musical. In fact, it's book-heavy. Without the Garbo performance and without the Lubitsch direction in the original screen adaptation, NINOTCHKA, the material flounders, or actually lounges across the big CinemaScope screen. Charisse dances beautifully and is a beautiful and talented woman, but she is no Garbo - and while Astaire is more suave than Melvyn Douglas, he is way too old for his role.The score is amazingly mediocre. Only one good song, ALL OF YOU, and that is a lulu- one of Porter's absolute best. The rest serve the purpose of book integration, but are uninspired. The list of musical numbers as they appear in the film are: MAIN TITLE, TOO BAD, Paris LOVES LOVERS, STEREOPHONIC SOUND, IT'S CHEMISTRY - THAT'S ALL, ALL OF YOU, SATIN AND SILK, SILK STOCKINGS (instrumental only), WITHOUT LOVE, FATED TO BE MATED (new to the film), JOSEPHINE, SIBERIA, RED BLUES, RITZ ROLL AND ROCK (new to the film), TOO BAD FINALE. The second song, Paris LOVES LOVERS does not occur until the film is a half hour old - far too much spacing between musical numbers. Astaire dances in four numbers: STEREOPHONIC SOUND, ALL OF YOU, FATED TO BE MATED, RITZ ROLL AND ROCK. Charisse dances the soliloquy SILK STOCKINGS and with Astaire in FATED TO BE MATED as well as with the corps de ballet in RED BLUES. Janis Paige dances in STEREOPHONIC SOUND and SATIN AND SILK.Paige's character is based on Esther Williams (also an MGM star) - wonder how she liked the non-flattering portrayal. Besides ALL OF YOU, the only other positive element is the excellent use of wide screen composition - this film truly serves the CinemaScope camera. However, the production design is very drab - the colors are muted and this in a musical is deadly. We need to be visually and aurally stimulated, and this film does neither. Added to this the choreography (Pan and Loring) is meaningless - just a series of steps rather than expressing character or plot progression.So poor color choices, poor score, too much plot and so-so dancing add up to a mediocre musical film, which is amazingly quite popular with the fans out there. Go figure! Mamoulian's only competent direction was his last. He began in films in 1930 and created many innovative directorial, cinematographic and editing techniques, then lost steam after his 1935 BECKY SHARP, turning out 13 more films, none of which even came close to his early work.If you are a fan of Astaire, Charisse or Porter, check it out. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother. The DVD has as special features the original trailer, a ten minute documentary on the making of the film, hosted by Ms. Charisse, and two musical shorts - POET AND PEASANT OVERTURE in full CinemaScope and the 1934 Vitaphone short - PAREE, PAREE - an adaptation of Porter's 1929 stage show FIFTY MILLION FRENCHMEN, featuring a quintet of songs, including YOU DO SOMETHING TO ME and YOU'VE GOT THAT THING.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Silk should be used for parachutes?" but as Ninotchka learns?NOT so in Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comparisons between this and the 1939 film "Ninotchka" are inevitable, but both films are entirely different genres and need to be evaluated on their own merits?or lack thereof. The 1939, Garbo-Douglas "Ninotchka" can be defined as a comedy/drama; the 1957, Astaire- Charisse "Silk Stockings" as a comedy/musical.Also? to those who find fault with the script as an unauthentic representation of Soviet citizenry circa the Cold War era? well?"Silk Stockings" is not meant to be a polemic on Communism, soviet style. It takes elements from Soviet life, exaggerates, and subverts the realities for comedic effect. We're talking comedy here, not documentary. Fred Astaire, as Hollywood producer Steve Canfield, here is an older Fred than we are used to seeing and although given star billing, the film is more of an ensemble effort. Cyd Charisse, as Ninotchhka, is tasked with playing a prudish, repressed, literal minded Soviet official. Ninotchhka, a personality manufactured by political propaganda is more of a one- dimensional caricature, a role that doesn't require great acting skill and Charisse manages her role with facility. Together Astaire and Charisse make a good dance team but the choreography is lackluster and pedestrian. Astaire at age 58 still demonstrates vitality but he's taking it easy here? nothing physically innovative or too rigorous. There's no Fred wow factor that would serve to add another jewel to the King of Dance's crown.Peter Lorre, one of a trio of Soviet commissars come to Paris to waylay a Russian composer's defection to Hollywood, diverges from his familiar portrayals. Formerly inseparable from characterizations of the sinister, sly insinuator here he's an engaging, chubby comrade/sidekick. Janis Paige was a ubiquitous, popular name in entertainment in the 1950s. She's the crass exhibitionist, Peggy Dayton, a concoction epitomizing the Hollywood star factory; she's a proxy for the over the top, gaudy commercialism of the Capitalist System. Her movie star is a manufactured product famous for showcasing her talents in the type of movie called water spectaculars, most commonly confined to swimming pools or sound stage sets mimicking exotic, fanciful lagoons. A not very flattering homage to Esther Williams...maybe?In "Silk Stockings" Cole Porter has given us song lyrics that seem forced, applied with a heavy- handed manipulation agonized over. The tunes are not memorable. Overall, there's a turgid gimmickry at work here, lacking the easy, almost effortless, sophisticated grace of his best work. This musical score is not representative of the best compositions in Porter's catalogue of memorable work. The most glaring bungling occurs in the cinematography and lightening. The camera work throughout is woefully uninspired, filmed predominately using medium shots, every scene is framed in a relentless monotony lacking visual variety. The unimaginative lightening only emphasizes the camera's deficiency further bathing everything in a uniform bright light, without nuance, shadow or mood. The result presents everything as if a flat page in a picture book. These "lazy" production values extend to the costumes and set décor as well where Technicolor is not used to advantage. The entire movie has a flat dullness, and drabness to it all. It might as well have been filmed in black and white. After finishing "Silk Stockings," Astaire didn't make another movie musical for ten years. After viewing the finished product, it's no mystery why he made that decision. All this being said? this is not the worst musical ever made, and can offer some entertainment value. Just sit back and enjoy the effortless charm and courtliness of Fred Astaire and the gorgeous Cyd Charise. What woman wouldn't want her figure and those beautiful, sculpted long legs?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike Fred Astaire's other 1957 release, Funny Face, Silk Stockings was not filmed on location in Paris. The film tells us that "Paris loves lovers", but never really shows it. Granted, very few of M-G-M's CinemaScope musicals were shot on location, after the first one (Rose Marie, 1954). Silk Stockings was no exception - though I have no idea if anyone even wanted to shoot it on location. Most of it takes place indoors. Not unlike the original, Ninotchka - but that was a more talk-oriented comedy. At any rate, elegant decor, costumes, and dialogue are relied upon here to convey the magic and romance of the setting as dictated by the script. Sometimes that works, and sometimes you may find yourself feeling cooped up, wishing you could see some of this immortal city everyone keeps singing and talking about. As Ninotchka, Cyd Charisse had the right looks for the part. As an actress, it's a stretch for her, requiring character acting, even a Russian accent. She pulls it off, but not brilliantly. Except when she dances - then she's Ninotchka to the life. It's one of her best roles as a dancer, and she's thrilling. As American producer Steve Canfield, Fred Astaire is not really on entirely familiar ground, either. The part seems a little aggressive for him. But he does his usual first-class job. Rouben Mamoulian - the director of the brilliant Love Me Tonight, and other early, innovative sound films - had his final hit with this one. It's not as creative as some of his other musicals, but overall it's a fine show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Ninotchka, but great fun - and Peter Lorre dances!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Silk Stockings (Rouben Mamoulian, 1957) is a neat musical update of Ninotchka, perhaps the best romantic comedy of them all. Brilliant ballerina Cyd Charisse is in the Garbo role, playing a Russian envoy who's sent to Paris to bring home the nation's greatest composer, but is seduced by the city - and the American movie producer she meets there (Fred Astaire). Most of the plot and many of the best lines remain intact, while Charisse's communist commissar affects a Garbo accent, rather than a Russian one. While that does highlight the obvious superiority of the original film, there's still a great deal to enjoy here. Taken on its own terms, Silk Stockings is sleek and breezy entertainment.Astaire, about to make his second of four retirements, is in good form and his numbers with Charisse are very attractive - if lacking the spark and sizzle of those in The Band Wagon. All of You is the obvious stand-out, both in its original incarnation and a glorious warehouse reprisal, though Cole Porter's score is positively littered with fun tunes. Charisse does some sensational work to the lyrically slight Red Blues, brassy Janis Paige sings the smutty stomp Josephine, and she and Astaire poke fun at cinema's passion for frightened innovation in Stereophonic Sound. The climactic Ritz Roll and Rock is both impressive and quite silly, as it suggests that fleet-footed Astaire and his high society pals from the stage-show-within-a-film can rock out far more comprehensively than Elvis. I don't really buy it.As a special treat for Golden Era buffs, Silk Stockings also features a most peculiar and welcome sight: Peter Lorre dancing. The star of M, a recurring Hitchcock heavy and all-round mercurial wizard of the screen - by this time displaying a latter-day wideness rarely seen outside of James Cagney's films - Lorre great fun as a fibbing, carousing rogue of a Russian diplomat. Arriving in a distressed state in the early hours, he rubbishes suggestions from his colleagues that he's been out on the town by claiming he's been having a manicure. "At two o'clock in the morning?" a comrade enquires. "I cannot sleep with long fingernails," he replies. Lorre also does one of the silliest dance routines I've ever seen, hoisting himself up between two chairs and swinging his legs back and forth in time to Porter's Too Bad.Silk Stockings isn't a classic to rival Ninotchka, but as these musical remakes go, it's good value - with attractive leads and a handful of great numbers. Charisse, who passed away in 2008, is really something to behold when she's in full flow. Usually it's impossible to wrench one's eyes away from Astaire, but she's a most inspiring diversion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie and a nod to Elvis...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching this film as a kid, probably about 40 years ago, so I recently purchased "Silk Stockings" on DVD and sat down to watch it. It certainly put a smile on my face because I remembered several of the songs AND the lyrics...especially "Stere-oh-phonic Sound" and "Satin and Silk"! One observation, though. While watching the dance number between Astaire and Charisse (the one right before the legendary Janis Paige "Josephine" number), I noticed that several times Ms. Charisse's skirt became a "skort" or a skirt/shorts combination. But in other parts of the dance, she was wearing a simple skirt with no "shorts split". This was probably done to give her complete movement of her legs but it was just interesting to see the skirt magically change throughout the dance number! And I LOVED the nod to the "Elvis generation" in the "Ritz, Roll, and Rock" dance number!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The very idea of a film version of this musical based on "Ninotchka" being produced at the height of both the cold war and the Hollywood blacklist is sick-making. But 1957 was also a year when the MGM musical-making machine was running at full steam, so there was plenty of talent to find a sure-footed way around the sticky bits and this is every bit as charming and debonair as "Band Wagon" or "It's Always Fair Weather." Fred Astaire is far too old to be Cyd Charisse's love interest and reportedly knew it, so their ritual courtship is tastefully deemphasized, and the ripe young beauty mostly cavorts in separate routines so that the aging master can do his stuff on his own terms. It's a little startling to see Peter Lorre in an MGM musical, but he makes an adorable Kommissar and could certainly lip synch just as well as George Tobias, or Audrey Hepburn for that matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scathing satire of drab humorless soviet bureaucracy and propaganda, combined with song and dance of Porter, Astaire, Cyd and others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to start off saying something unexpected. I was struck how much the basic plot resembles that of the previous musical "Belle of New York", also starring Fred, with another famous dancer: Vera Ellen, in Cyd's role. They both involve Fred taking on the challenge(why?) of trying to break through the thick ice of a beautiful, but emotionally repressed, young woman, who is always seen wearing a drab uniform. True , Cyd's character (Ninotchka) was a much harder case to crack, but eventually, Fred succeeded in both cases. In consequence, the singing(dubbed) and dancing of Vera-Ellen and Cyd is delayed compared to Fred's, and it takes time for their characters to fully warm up to Fred's lifestyle, including exuberant dancing. They both get a dance without Fred, in their bedrooms, when they first change from their drab uniforms into some sexy female clothing(including silk stockings). In both films, it looks like they will soon marry Fred at one point. But the woman then becomes disenchanted by something, and partially reverts to her old self until the finale, when their imminent marriage is again hinted. While the earlier film was set in turn of the century NYC, this film is set in contemporary Paris and sometimes Moscow. However, the combination of Fred and Janet Blair impart a significant American flavor to the film. Thus, two musical numbers lampoon the recent pop phenomenon of rock and roll, or several film enhancement technologies commonly adopted in recent times to try to lure potential customers away from their small- screen B&amp;W monaural TVs, back into movie theaters. The present film is much longer than the earlier film, with a more interesting and complicated plot and more significant characters. However, we are stuck through most of it, even to the end, with Cyd's unpleasant arrogant robotic monotone Soviet persona, occasionally replaced by Janet Blair's blasé personality or snippets of Cyd's westernized personality. I would rate the songs in the earlier film as being, on the whole, better, while the dancing is more stimulating in this film. Cyd's solo dancing, in the several opportunities she is given, is especially interesting. There are an endless number of jabs at the stereotypical repressed lives of Soviets, half-truth Soviet propaganda about capitalism, and paranoia, to counter Ninotchka's constant criticisms of 'decadent' capitalism, as she saw it or had been indoctrinated to expect. At one point, Ninotchka, composer Boroff, and the 3 stooge-like commisars sent to bring him back from Paris, have returned to Moscow, reminisce about how they miss their brief stay in Paris, then stage an exuberant dance to music recently composed by Boroff, while singing that they have the "Red Blues": a nifty title. Comically, during this dance, a Soviet bureaucrat walks through the room twice, inducing all to revert to pretending they are discussing the virtues of communism over capitalism. Since Fred can't get a visa to visit Russia, he thinks up a trick to induce the turn of all to Paris...The overall theme of the film clearly is that the Soviet attempt to remake human nature to be interested only in basic survival mode and to only serve the interests of the state is flawed and will ultimately be rejected by real people.In the later part of the film, Ninotchka seemingly develops a split personality, occasionally succumbing to Fred's attempt to westernize her thinking and behavior and seduce her, but then reverting to her monotone Soviet personality. Seems like she mostly lets down her guard after she's had some Champagne. In the finale, she tears up her second plane ticket back to Moscow, after learning that Fred still wants to marry her, thereby presumably proving that even the seemingly most loyal adherents to the Soviet state, given the chance, will choose to live in a western country.The 3 clownish commisars sent to bring back the reluctant -to-leave-Paris composer Boroff rather remind me of the 3 sailors on leave in "On the Town". Jules Munshin served as one of the 3 in both groups, being much taller than any of the others. The choice of Peter Lorre and Joseph Buloff as the other two seems odd, as neither was musical and the singing of both was dubbed. Would have been interesting to have the Marx Brothers or 3 Stooges at their height in their places. But would have been considered overkill, I'm sure.I wonder why the screenwriters decided to subtly deride Esther William's acting ability in clearly casting Janis Paige in her likeness, with the implication that it was doubtful if she could carry a film that lacked her swimming ballets. Interestingly, Esther's long contract with MGM had rather recently been terminated. Seldom used Rouben Mamoulian, as director, was a controversial choice. His last film musical('48) was an expensive box office flop for MGM. However, he had directed some prior successful films , as well as the stage versions of "Oklahoma" and "Carousel". More significantly, he spent his youth in Georgia, where Stalin had also spent his youth. Thus, it was felt he could help provide a more authentic presentation of the Soviets.The non-musical "The Iron Petticoat" and "Jet Pilot", with similar themes of defecting Soviet women, were released about the same time, but were box-office flops, compared to the moderate success of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Musical version of "Ninotchka". Three bumbling Russian men go to Paris to bring a Russian composer home. He doesn't want to go and a friend of his named Steve Canfield (Fred Astaire) talk them out of it. Then strict unemotional Ninotchka Yoschenko (Cyd Charisse) comes by to get the job done. Steve falls for her and tries to get her to fall in love with him.This is a good MGM musical but far from being one of the best. The dance numbers are energetic but dull (Charisse's strip tease goes on forever), the songs are forgetful, it's far too long and the simplistic portrayal of Rusians would be offensive if it weren't so silly. Still it does have its good points--Astaire and Charisse are in top form and just great; Peter Lorre actually sings AND dances (sort of); Janis Paige is full of energy and steals every scene she's in; the script is somewhat amusing and the "Stereophonic Sound" number is a show stopper (and the only good song in the film). So, all in all, it's worth catching but no great shakes. I give it a 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very few of the classic 1950s musicals were original stories. Most of them were musical adaptations of novels, stage plays or, increasingly, the previous generations' non-musical pictures. The quality of these often had little bearing on that of the original. The musical A Star is Born is for example considerably better than the original. But they could also be vastly worse than their predecessors after the rigours of plot rehash, singer-dancer casting and the conventions of a new era.The 1939 movie Ninotchka could only really have worked with Greta Garbo ? it was built around her persona. Silk Stockings does not ? and could not ? have Garbo. Cyd Charisse is not a terrible actress, and even does a decent caricature of a steely soviet officer, speaking without moving a single other muscle in her face. Garbo on the other hand managed to get across the same idea without even such a trick as freezing up her face. She had something likable and beguiling about her even before her grim exterior was broken down. Charisse on the other hand succeeds only in presenting Ninotchka as totally robotic. That may be to her credit but it does not benefit the movie. Her transformation does not seem as plausible as Garbo's, and she is not especially human even after it.And this really seems to feed into all the other problems with Silk Stockings. With the Cold War and the McCarthy scare as a backdrop, there was no way the movie could be remotely equivocal about communism. As such the original story has lost a lot of its complexity, and a tone that was once playful now seems belligerent. Many of the lines seem unnecessarily dumbed-down (compare for example the language used by Garbo commenting on a fancy hat to the equivalent of Charisse and the stockings). There is a new subplot about a Russian composer having his music distorted for a screen musical, and there are a lot of attacks on ostentatious movie-making. But this is as simplistic as the politics, never going further than disdainfully listing the ills of modern Hollywood, as in the song "Stereophonic Sound".Presumably the studio didn't grasp the irony of these sentiments in a picture that was itself shot in Technicolor and cinemascope. Director Rouben Mamoulian probably did, apparently describing the new aspect ratio as "the stupidest shape I've ever seen". For a director usually at his most brilliant and inventive in the musical genre, his work is decidedly lacklustre here. The irony cannot have been lost on poor old Fred Astaire either, who is not at all well-served by 'scope. Either his feet are cut off at the bottom of the frame, or he seems lost amid all the other business on screen. It's a shame this was to be his last top-hat-and-tails performance. It's not exactly a noble send-off.There is one nice feature of Silk Stockings, and that is a sweet little performance by Peter Lorre. He's at his best here, all pent-up as if on the edge of a maniacal outburst. But the fact that this is the only laudable thing to say about the picture shows how generally dire the rest of it is. The Cole Porter songs are far from his best; weak rehashes of material from his earlier musicals. The second great irony about Silk Stockings is that, despite its waxing lyrical about the magic of true romance as opposed to bland analysis, the romance in the picture feels completely flat. It lacks all of the original movie's warmth and passion, not just in the love story but also in, say, the friendship between Ninotchka and the trio of Russian comrades. All in all, this is an atrocious movie.</fullReview>

Whereas High Society came off to me as an unneeded remake of The Philadelphia Story, Silk Stockings manages to hold its own and not come off as a cheap remake Ninotchka, which was released prior to the cold war in 1939 (and not doing much good for American-Soviet relations). Silk Stockings was made right during the cold war and towards the end of the McCarthy years. It's interesting seeing the story of love overcoming ideology retold from the cold war perspective, but it doesn't come as mindless commie bashing; in fact it does at least paint a positive view of Russian arts. But propaganda it still is, as just like Ninotchka before it, favouring the gayety and decadence of the west to the rigid and gray world of the Soviet Union. The movie is self-aware its propaganda, with the film being made within the film described as "The iron curtain dissolved by music", and Astaire gleefully proclaiming the film within a film as "what propaganda!".The influence of the director Rouben Mamoulian is one of the aspects which helps elevate Silk Stockings. Mamoulian was one of the most innovative directors of the 1930's, whose credits include the ground-breaking musicals Applause and Love Me Tonight. Although this was 1957 and his final film, he was an innovator of the genre and his handsome direction is apparent throughout the film. The musical numbers take full advantage of the cinemascope frame, such as the number 'We Can't Go Back to Russia', which features multiple people dancing at once in a long, unbroken shot; while Fred Astaire is dancing, Peter Lorre might be doing something amusing in the background. The dancing on display in the film is not Astaire's most accomplished, but is entertaining none the less. Mamoulian never worked with Ninotchka director Ernst Lubitsch, although Love Me Tonight did feature Lubitsch elements, as well as regular Lubitsch stars Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald. Elements of the famous Lubitsch Touch are present throughout Silk Stockings; for example, when the Soviet commissar has just finished his first encounter with Ninotchka and is surprised to discover she is a woman, his secretary then bursts into the room to tell him this very fact, very much a Lubitsch inspired gag.Cyd Charisse succeeds in holding her own, not merely doing an imitation of Greta Garbo; showing that she was an underrated actress as well as a great dancer. Plus it simply a pleasure seeing Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse reunited again after The Band Wagon. Astaire could have conceivably played Melvyn Douglas' role back in 1939 (I often wish the man could have done more non-musical comedic roles), so his casting does work; plus I've always championed Astaire's for his unsung comic abilities. The casting of Peter Lorre as one of the three operatives is brilliant decision, while Janis Page is also very entertaining as the uncultured actress Peggy Dayton.The film's selection of songs written by Cole Porter are very good. 'Stereophonic Sound' is a satire on the habits of movie goers more concerned with a film's technical aspects over the content of the film itself, while Cyd Charrise's solo dance number captures the decadence of capitalism in the form of dance. The 'Ritz Roll n' Rock' reflects changing musical landscape from jazz to rock n'roll, and appropriately so, as this marked Astaire's retirement from musicals, in the final number of the film dressed in his trademark top hat, white tie and tails; what a send-off! Although my favourite number in the film is Astaire and Charisse dancing on a film set in 'All You Dance', simply beautiful. The big flaw I have with Silk Stockings however is the length; at the two hours the movie is too long, and some trimming could have gone a long way. With thirty minutes chopped out, Silk Stockings could go from a good movie to a great one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great musical but a great entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Silk Stockings" isn't a great musical in the same way that "Ninotchka" was a great comedy, despite the Cole Porter score, but it is a sublime entertainment. The director was the great Rouben Mamoulian who was probably second only to Minnelli at this sort of thing, (in his use of color and widescreen or as the song says, 'Glorious Technicolor, Breathtaking Cinemascope and Stereophonic Sound'); consequently it looks great and thanks to the superb script from Leonard Gershe, Leonard Spigelgass and Harry Kurnitz, borrowing more than liberally from the original, it sounds great, too.Fundamentally, it's a vehicle for its leads. Fred Astaire may have been almost 60 at the time but you would hardly notice; he's still as nimble on his feet as he ever was. As an actress Cyd Charisse is no Garbo, (she wasn't much of a comedienne either), but she was a great partner for Astaire and a terrific dancer in her own right. Janis Paige is here too and is good enough to make you half wish she had been cast in the film version of "The Pajama Game", (as we all know she was passed over in favor of Doris Day). Peter Lorre, Jules Munshin and Joseph Buloff make up the Russian delegation and one of the joys of any musical is seeing Lorre supporting himself between a table and a chair during a Russian dance. Indeed the whole movie is something of a treat and if it sends you back to "Ninotchka" so much the better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An above decent musical remake of Ninotchka</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Silk Stockings is not one of MGM's best films, with it just lacking their earlier films' sparkle, and it is not as good as Ninotchka(a Greta Garbo and Ernst Lubitsch gem), that it's a remake of. However, while it has its flaws, it is eminently watchable and is good entertainment.The film is a handsome-looking film, especially in the sumptuous sets, though the colourful and expansive photography, not-too-bright-not-too-drab lighting and elegant costumes also delight. The music is energetic and whimsical and the songs, while not among Cole Porter's best(Ritz Rock and Roll is a little dull and tired) are very good, with memorable melodies and Porter's usual wit evident. All of You and Paris Loves Lovers are dreams come true for Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse lovers, but the highlight is the enormously fun Stereophonic Sound, Siberia has some funny moments but not for all tastes. Choreographically Silk Stockings is splendid, but does not waste Astaire or Charisse's talents at all, the songs I mentioned as highlights are also the highlights for the choreography, and while Ritz Rock and Roll is tired song-wise Astaire's dancing certainly is not.Also present are a very clever script, where most of the humour sparkles and the romantic parts have the right balance of sweetness and magic while not feeling too much, it also has a good deal of warmth chemistry-wise which stops it from feeling cold and underdeveloped. The film is warm-hearted, good-humoured and light-footed on the most part, and is competently directed, while the cast are as splendid as the choreography. Astaire is as charming and graceful as ever, and Charisse is glamour and elegance personified. Janis Paige is hilarious, and comes close to stealing the show in Stereophonic Sound, and Peter Lorre and Jules Munshin are amusing, though both have given better performances elsewhere.It's not a flawless film though. It does get heavy-handed in places and occasionally over-plotted, the anti-Russian jokes may leave a sour taste in the mouth and as aforementioned the Ritz Rock and Roll lacks the energy and is not as memorable or up-to-tempo as the rest of the film.Despite the problems, Silk Songs is very watchable and fun and an above decent but inferior musical remake of Ninotchka. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fred &amp; Cyd take on a Garbo classic with songs and dances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1955 Broadway musical "Silk Stockings" is one of the few hit stage shows that has not (as of yet) had a major New York revival, even at the City Center Encores. One of the reasons is probably its dated communist propaganda spoofing, something as gone with the wind as the south of Tara and Rhett and Scarlett. But we have this movie version of the musical, and if we don't get the original cast (Don Ameche, Hildegard Kneff and Gretchen Wyler) we do get more than acceptable substitutes (Fred Astaire, Cyd Charisse and Janis Paige) instead. After their pairing in "The Band Wagon" in 1953, it seems inevitable that the team of Astaire and Charisse would be re-teamed, something that other than Fred &amp; Ginger for 10 films had happened with Rita Hayworth for 2 films. When "Silk Stockings" was adapted for the screen, only Cyd Charisse of MGM's musical stars seemed capable of playing that part, even if her acting was nowhere near the quality of Garbo's."Silk Stockings" is of course a musical version of the 1939 romantic comedy "Ninotchka", and was the final Broadway musical of Cole Porter, the genius behind "Anything Goes", "Kiss Me Kate" and "Can-Can". An original Broadway cast album reveals a charming, if not remarkably sung musical score, with pleasant romantic tunes such as "All of You" and "Paris Loves Lovers" added to the snappy comic songs "Stereophonic Sound", "Too Bad" and the show-stopping "Siberia", which is up there with "Kiss Me Kate's" "Brush Up Your Shakespeare" as a classic song for the comic supporting players. Then, there's the big dance number, "Red Blues", which in itself isn't anything outstanding, but an excuse for the chorus to get out there and do all sorts of high kicks and traditional Russian dance moves. (The lyrics basically continue to repeat themselves over and over, as if a skipping record, but getting wilder and wilder. With Cyd Charisse dancing, it ends up the hot spot of the film.) The story of American film director Steve Canfield in Paris to film his latest epic has a Russian composer defecting, sending in Russian agent Ninotchka to bring him home. She finds she loves the capitalistic society and the lights of Paris, and even more so, the charming American man who tells her that they were fated to be mated. But her duty calls her back, and the lovers part so Canfield utilizes the Russian defectors sent prior to Ninotchka to bring her back for the final fade out. Among those men is a comical Peter Lorre who sings and dances for the first and only time, or as some may say, screeches and shakes a leg. Sultry Janis Paige takes on an Ann Miller type role as the American movie star Peggy Dayton and steals every scene she is in. Paige ironically didn't get to repeat her Broadway role in "The Pajama Game" the same year, but when you're dancing with Fred Astaire, why quibble? (Ironically, she would co-star with her replacement, Doris Day, in "Please Don't Eat the Daisies", whom she had ironically appeared with in Day's first film, "Romance on the High Seas").Porter wrote a new song for the movie, "The Ritz Roll and Rock", a spoof of the rock music of the time, combining it with Astaire's traditional white tie and tails. The song is not a classic, but with Astaire's charm and the MGM glamor treatment, it ends up a lot of fun. When Paige and Astaire get together to honor the new trend of glorious Technicolor, breathtaking cinemascope and stereophonic sound, you will grin from ear to ear with the cleverness of the parody of advances in Hollywood movie making. This will never beat the charm of the original movie, but there is a lot of fun to be had in it, and Astaire and Charisse have more chemistry than some of the much younger women he had been co-starring with in some previous recent movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't watch this right after Ninotchka</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You don't want to watch this movie right after its source, the 1939 Ernst Lubitch masterpiece "Ninotchka." Cyd Charisse is certainly a very fine dancer, but she can't begin to deliver Garbo's lines as well as Garbo did, and, unfortunately, she is given a lot of them to deliver. In general, most of what repeats "Ninotchka," often word for word, looks weak in comparison. The story also loses some of its continuity when important scenes from the original get omitted.So, if "Silk Stockings" doesn't do "Ninotchka" well, what does it have of its own to offer in compensation? After all, that would be the compensation. Unfortunately, the answer is slim pickings. This is not one of Cole Porter's better scores; there are only a few catchy numbers (like "Stereophonic Sound"), most of which feature Janet Paige - who is really very good in this movie - and Astaire. The efforts to be "with it" - Astaire's "Ritz, Roll, and Rock", for example - are forgettable.Watched on its own it would be a painless way to waste two hours. But don't watch it right after "Ninotchka" out of curiosity: it will seem to take a lot longer than its one hour and 57 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If they advertised Ninotchka with the immortal ad-line 'Garbo laughs!', they should have plugged this musical remake with the legend 'Lorre Dances!' The human goldfish shares two musical numbers as one of three Russian commissars sent after a runaway Russian composer who, horror of horrors, is considering composing the score for an American picture to be shot in Paris.If his dancing is amusingly underwhelming, most of the rest of the numbers are in the charge of Fred Astaire as the playboy producer of Janis Paige's 'first non-swimming picture' - War and Peace (well, a bit of it). "How do you feel about Tolstoy?" ask the gentlemen of the press. "There's absolutely no truth to the rumours, we're just good friends," she replies between smacking the water out of her ears. Ninotchka (Charisse), the humourless Russian commissar they send after their original commissars, takes a more disapproving view. "This is an American picture. You're liable to have Napoleon win." Even if you haven't seen the original, it's not hard to guess which two characters fall in love.Nonetheless, the film is surprisingly entertaining for a later MGM musical (Fred Astaire's last at the studio). Cole Porter delivers a strong score (minus the lyrics to the title number, here used as background to Charisse's big dance solo), Janis Paige delivers a more streetwise variation of Jean Hagen's dumb blonde from Singin' in theRain and the script delivers plenty of digs at the movies in general ("You know what prestige means?" "Yeah, pictures that don't make money."), CinemaScope in particular and Communism as a matter of course ("Get me a copy of 'Who's Still Who.'").Mamoulian doesn't always know how to handle the Scope frame, ruining a potentially priceless early joke where Lorre coaches his comrades to smile by shooting only the back of his head and not making best use of the frame in Janis Paige and Fred Astaire's number celebrating 'Glorious Technicolor, Breathtaking CinemaScope and Stereophonic Sound', but elsewhere uses it well enough to make this widescreen version a particular treat if you've only seen the fullframe video or TV versions (the Russkies may have sent three commissars after Borov, but you'd only ever see two at one time on those!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It leaves me wanting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me this film has much I like. With Fred Astaire, Cyd Charisse, music, dancing, what more could one want? The music is catchy, jazzy, cool. The pace is good. The dancing numbers become progressively more complex, more energetic, the plot is OK (for a musical), and one can overlook Cyd Charisse's atrocious accent, but there was something lacking! By himself, Astaire was the master. His solo number on the club stage was fantastic. By herself, Cyd Charisse was spellbinding. Her solo number in her Moscow apartment was breathtaking. But together they just didn't zing like Astaire and Rogers did. When I watch musicals I do so for the dance numbers. I suspect I'm no different from most others. And when Fred and Ginger took the floor I didn't want it to end. They were that good! But with Fred and Cyd, the moves were excellent, there was that trademark single shot of the scene demanded by Astaire, everything was as it should have been except for chemistry. There just wasn't any. Compare that to the numbers Charisse danced with Ricardo Montalban in "Fiesta". In all fairness that shouldn't stop anyone from seeing this film. It's worth the price of admission for the solo numbers alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, did my family hate this one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely have I seen my wife and oldest daughter hate a film as much as they hated "Silk Stockings"! I didn't think it was that bad, but I did understand SOME of their feelings. It sure should have been a lot better! "Silk Stockings" is a musical remake of "Ninotchka". Now that is a serious problem, as this Ernst Lubitsch film is a wonderful classic--a film that is very, very hard to top. But the film didn't even come close to the quality of the original for many reasons--though the biggest one is the music. Too often, the romance or comedy of the film grinds to a severe halt when the musical numbers intrude--and they did intrude! Few of the song and dance numbers were that good or had much to do with the film, but the tempo was even more seriously a problem. While the film is a sweet little plot--the songs are often HUGE production numbers. The fit is all wrong. And you know it's a problem when Fred Astaire is totally lost in the process! On top of all this, the characters are way too cartoony and silly to work. Overall, I see no need to see this one considering that "Ninotchka" is light-years better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would Have Liked More Dancing, Less Singing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this to see Fred Astaire dance and Cyd Charisse to smile and show off her legs and dancing talents. I got very little of the above. Astaire, as "Steve Canfield," sang a lot more than he danced, and his singing was always "fair, at best." Charisse's character, "Ninotchka Yoschenko," mostly pouted throughout the film and spoke with a stupid accent, not exactly appealing. It also takes away from the film when you know someone else is singing, not her! To be fair, some of their work here together just makes you marvel at them. Perhaps another look - this time with a CinemaScope widescreen DVD picture, - would make me appreciate this movie more.This is a musical remake of the 1939 Greta Garbo film "Ninotochka." I don't think either is all that great but given the choice to watch either again, I'd take the Garbo film, even though it's always good to watch Astaire and Charisse stepping out, so to speak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Russia with dance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing a lot of Fred Astaire films in grainy black &amp; white RKO productions here is Fred in MGM spruced up colour. Silk Stockings is a 1956 musical remake of Ninotchka the 1939 comedy starring Greta Garbo which was billed as 'Garbo laughs.'The remake is a clash of culture musical-comedy and was made during the cold war period when the USA was looking for reds under the beds at home. Therefore there is some bite to the satire.Cyd Charisse plays the pretty but stern Russian envoy sent to Paris to bring back a musical composer unwilling to return to Russia and who has been contracted to write low brow music for a film by the producer Fred Astaire. She also has to retrieve the three bumbling idiots who were originally sent to get him back but were diverted by the glitz of Paris courtesy of Astaire. Fred distracts Cyd by taking her to nightclubs, getting her stunning outfits, showing her the landmarks as well song and dance where she begins to thaw and starts to enjoy the bourgeois and decadent lifestyle of the west. Its not long before Cyd is kicking those famous legs high.The film is a little variable in quality and also rather overlong. The studio bound Paris setting does not help matters but some of the musical numbers gets in the way of the story and pads out the running time.There is a nice supporting cast with Peter Lorre scene stealing with his between the chair and table Cossack dancing and Janis Paige stunning as the Esther William's type film star.The film is a sad farewell note to the musicals of yesteryear, there is a song and dance number called 'Stereophonic Sound.' At the climax we see Fred singing and dancing to a rock n roll number which is a take on the famous Bill Haley song which kind of has its own surreal charm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cole Porter Meets Iron Curtain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who think that Cole Porter and the Cold War make strange bedfellows aren't going to have their minds changed by this movie. It's a bizarre mishmash of MGM kitsch, Red-baiting, and homosexual archness, adapted from the stage musical. It also must be the dullest movie ever made in celebration of fun. I don't know what the stage version did (it's never revived) but this movie has one idea (Communism boring, Capitalism fun!) and it keeps beating us on the head with it while showing us around out a lot of Louis Whatever hotel suites that few Americans in 1957 could afford either. 1...2...3...what are we fighting for! (Money, evidently.) The propaganda would be more persuasive if Charisse didn't look sexier in her Worker's Black Nylons than she does in the silks that mark her transformation from dull comrade to fun capitalist-- and if those silks didn't actually appear to be nylons. For Komic Relief, there are Three Komrades-- they're the Three Stooges. The 'Ninotchka' (Charisse) is innocent of kissing-- she's like the native girls in '30s South Seas flicks. I guess they didn't do THAT behind the Iron Curtain. Perhaps the relevant passages were blacked out of her state translation of THE SUN ALSO RISES. We wait, and wait, and wait while Astaire sings and Janis Paige (she's trying to be Jean Hagen) chews the scenery, for Astaire and Charisse to dance. The dance numbers are very good and show off Astaire's unending quest to try out new ideas. Shame the rest of the movie didn't do so. This period piece is useful as a stored version of the Broadway show but it's watchable only if you occasionally use fast-forward.</fullReview>

I felt decidedly uncomfortable throughout in regards to the political message it portrayed, it seems to confuse communism and puritanism, just because they didn't have silk stockings didn't mean they weren't allowed to dance or sing! it takes the anti communist propaganda too far for my liking and spoils what would have been a reasonable musical. I know political feeling, especially in America was different in 1957 and that it was a remake of an existing film but i still think the film suffers for it, as i couldn't concentrate on any of the sweeping elegance that other viewers have commented on.

		<fullReview>I'm grateful for any Cyd Charisse appearance, even if it is a bungled musical with a by now distractingly ugly Fred Astair and desperate Peter Lorre. I'm not expert enough in musicals to see precisely what went wrong and how it could have been fixed. But this gives the impression of tiredness: the numbers don't have any energy or cleverness: the cinematic nature of the thing is lacking; and the story (even though it worked before) is insufficient to move things along.This isn't quite Cyd: she is made to act with an oddly stilted accent. But she has one rather terrific dance sequence (thankfully not choreographed by the then lazy Hermes Pan) where she transforms herself from the grim appara-chick to a "modern" woman, going through two stages of underwear that couldn't possibly have been worn under the final getup. Its the centerpiece of the whole thing and presumably where the title comes from.Oh, and there's another redhead here. This was in the heyday of reds (Technicolor, you see) so we got a sexy one and a library-type one.If you rent the DVD, there is a far, far superior short musical on it: "Paree, Paree."By the way, this is where Jim Critchfield got his characters of Boris and Natasha for the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons ? the looks of course, but even the names are similar.And a second incidental comment regarding Paris. France performed very badly in the war, what with embarrassing military capitulation, eager collaboration with the Germans, and native antisemitism. So (until France decided to side with the Soviet Union in the sixties) there was a deliberate policy of the Americans and French to rehabilitate the nation. And the centerpiece of that was the invention of Paris as a place for romance. The French never thought of it that way; its an American, mostly Hollywood invention. The French would have thought of Paris as a center of thought, art, industry, commerce, rather like Americans think of New York.Since after the war (and mostly since) it has none of these things, it has reinvented itself as a theme park for lovers.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>
