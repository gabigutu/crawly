		<shortDescription>NINOTCHKA Still Defies Her Critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An expertly-played and presented comedy that continues to be dogged by detractors for the oddest reasons. Some feel NINOTCHKA suffers compared to Lubitsch's earlier work, finding it formulaic alongside 1933's TROUBLE IN PARADISE. (I hadn't known Lubitsch had been given 'do-what-thou-wilt' privileges from the Hays Office - I'd labored under the delusion he faced the same restrictions in content and tone every other moviemaker did in 1939.) Other nay-sayers decry the film's jabs at Soviet collectivism as 'dated' if not 'unenlightened'. (Huh? You mean show trials and forced starvation of kulaks were GOOD things that a truly witty screenplay would celebrate?) Still other kibitzers squawk over the casting, of all things! (While it IS fun to picture William Powell or Robert Montgomery in the role of Leon, the boulevardier, Melvyn Douglas was never better than he is here. If he has his spotty moments, it's in those scenes where he must swoon with ardor, reciting dialogue that rings a tad purple to the ear; it's quite possible Powell or Montgomery would have fared even worse reading those lines.) Okay, enough defense - now let's go to NINOTCHKA's numerous strengths. Garbo is magnificent; she has a real knack for comedy (her deadpan entrance is hilarious) yet, as always, is able to break your heart with a look, a word, a gesture. Her three 'stooges' (Sig Rumann, Alexander Granach &amp; Felix Bressart) are broadly funny and genuinely endearing. Ina Claire is everything her legend always claimed she was - though her character is icily calculating, you can't hate any woman who can make dialogue bristle like this. Lubitsch is in complete command throughout; his staging and pacing of the proceedings, masterful in its seeming effortlessness. Even the storied Metro glitz shines in NINOTCHKA, right down to the brilliant artifice of Cedric Gibbons' art direction (the Eiffel Tower sets especially). Last but not least is the superb screenplay by (among other hands) the team of Charles Brackett &amp; Billy Wilder. Wisely, their satiric darts are dipped in a curare leavened by wit and sentiment, and while they are thrown with accuracy, their sting is never such that the satire sinks into the mire of political ideology. NINOTCHKA, after all, is about the triumph of love over politics, and to those who feel trapped in the prevailing toilet-ethic of the Farrelly Brothers' blood-poisoning of modern comedy, represents a much-needed antidote. Inoculate yourself at your earliest opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Garbo laughs... and for very good reason!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NINOTCHKA tells the story of a female special envoy from Russia (Greta Garbo), sent to Paris to investigate the rather unorthodox and generally inefficient way in which three Russian ambassadors (Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski--the trio serve as an excuse for much slapstick hilarity in the film) are carrying out their job. They're supposed to be selling jewels belonging to the former Grand Duchess, Swana (Ina Claire), but instead get distracted by the luxuries of capitalist society as gleefully pressed onto them by the Count d'Algout, Leon (Melvyn Douglas). It doesn't take long for the dour, humourless Ninotchka to fall hard for the charming Leon, and their love story begins atop the Eiffel Tower in Paris. We gather, however, that Leon and the ex-Duchess share a casual on-off relationship and Swana handily uses Nina's deep love for her mother Russia to blackmail the latter into returning to Russia without a word to Leon. So what happens when the Russian customs official refuses to give Leon a visa into Russia? You'll have to watch for yourself to discover the whimsical, delightful ending.All in all, NINOTCHKA is a fine, funny film, with romance spilling out of its seams. From the first dry, crisp conversation between Leon and his Ninotchka while they wait for a whistle-break in Parisian traffic, you become involved with the characters and their love as he tries to break down her icy defenses, as he keeps trying in the face of her many rebuffs. One standout scene would be that of the drunken interlude in Nina's Royal Suite, as the couple look quizzically at the necklace that would bring them together and separate them, and Leon crowns his girlfriend before laying her gently on the bed, kissing her goodnight and taking his gentlemanly leave. It's also hard to beat the scene in which, as the tagline proudly declares, 'Garbo Laughs!', as Leon tries to coax a laugh out of Nina, and only succeeds by falling over backwards in his chair. The romantic comedy is certainly strong and sweet, but there's plenty of other comedy available as well, largely thanks to the three Russian sidekick ambassadors charmed by the benefits of capitalism. It's great fun watching them flounder helplessly when they first meet their stern, unforgiving Comrade Yakushova, but warm up to her when they return to Russia and have an omelette dinner together.There is no doubt that Greta Garbo turns in a great performance as the title character. She plays the ice queen very convincingly, with the appropriate suggestion that her lips haven't seen a smile in a decade or so. (If you're worried, her Russian accent is also perfectly credible, though at times she lapses into something somewhat less than Russian.) When she finally breaks into laughter, the transition is believable, as is the sunny change that thereafter infuses Nina as she becomes Leon's Ninotchka. It's an especially nice touch to have her unable to suppress a wave of laughter in the first official meeting--it's also hilarious when she suddenly generously gives her three colleagues fifty francs because they're out of money... only to qualify that by asking them to bring her back 45 francs! I think it is to Garbo's credit that she can pull off both the dour, passionless Comrade Yakushova and the almost shy, giggling Ninotchka with equal aplomb. (Her frequent question, "Can I make a speech?", when drunk on champagne is--I think the only word for it is--adorable.) That face of hers, so famous around the world, really *is* made for the cameras, and I think Lubitsch captured it beautifully. (Lubitsch also directs with the lightest of touches, allowing his cast full rein.) Melvyn Douglas looks absolutely no different from his role a decade later in MR BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE, but there is no doubting that this is Garbo's film.This is a sweet, happy film about love overcoming ideology, nationality, and geography, and one that doesn't feel the need to beat us over the head with it. The relationship is well-developed, the characters interesting, and the execution top-notch. For me personally, the film lacks something that would render it a 10/10 classic, but that certainly isn't indicative of its quality as a romantic comedy. A great way to spend an evening. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Didn't Garbo Make More Comedies?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see that Billy Wilder collaborated on this. Was it a studio decision that Garbo wasn't cast as a comedienne? From the evidence in this film, she should have been. Her timing is excellent, her delivery very special. This is a gem I'd never seen that deserves its National Registry status. In 1939 the Soviet Union had sympathizers in the US, and during the coming World War it was an ally. This gentle spoof of Soviet seriousness and self-conscious worker ethics foreshadows the arguments that were later trotted out after the War to begin the Cold War, but here the humor and satire are soft, more Noel Coward than propaganda.My lament is not seeing more comedy from Garbo. She made such serious and tragic films, when she could have been making us laugh. The film is dated, yes, but Garbo herself shines through along with her three Russian accomplices. I think that Billy Wilder and Garbo would have been a great team</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie -- timeless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fantastic movie. I can't understand why some people have problems with it. Makes me wonder if we don't have some people recoiling at some innocent cracks made at the Soviet Union's expense. As a romantic comedy it has very few peers and is a great introduction to black and white films for those used only to color. There are a plethora of interesting secondary characters. Garbo is wonderful, of course, and Dougless is as good as I've seen him any film. Lubitsch's direction is masterly, but not 'ground-breaking', a fault for which some are willing to run him under the harrow -- a case of holding someone to impossible standards. Nobody can break new ground in every film -- sometimes we have to settle for mere masterly competence. See this film! Unless you happen to romanticize the former Soviet Union, you will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greta Garbo as Secret "Cold War" Weapon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ninotchka has been making a hit with audiences since she hit the screen in 1939. A fascinating, yet little known, "second life" of the film was played out during the Italian Elections of 1947-48. The U.S. was most anxious that the Communists not be elected and pulled out all the stops to prevent it. One was to approach MGM and request prints of Ninotchka - to be shown widely to working class audiences in Italy. Since no 16mm prints of the film yet existed, MGM Labs did "print downs" from the original nitrate negative. The resulting prints are astonishingly beautiful (I have one) and they estimate five million Italians viewed it and other propaganda films each week before the elections - in spite of the efforts of the Communists to prevent its showing. One pro-Communist worker said afterward "What licked us was Ninotchka!" (See "Killing Hope" by William Blum). To paraphrase Carl Denham in King Kong, once again "Beauty Killed The Beast!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfection!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My all-time favorite comedy! All right, I am a Garbo fan regardless of the role, and I happen to think that Melvyn Douglas was perfectly cast here. In fact, the entire cast excels, without exception, in one of Lubitsch's finest and most elegant films. Those who think that lines like "The show trials were a great success...there are now fewer, but better, Russians" are dated, or that making fun of totalitarianism is tasteless and politically incorrect need to lighten up. Garbo is not only very funny in this classic, she is inexpressibly lovely (as always). A must-see for any lover of beautifully crafted and entertaining film comedies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly enjoyable comedy with Garbo at her best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Garbo essayed the first of her two comedy roles here and proved herself as adept at comic timing as she was in drama. Her performance earned her fourth and final Oscar nom (the film received additional noms for Best Picture, Story and Screenplay). Here she plays a dour and serious Russian Soviet sent to Paris to bring back three comrades who seem to be succumbing to the Western World's delights. She is pursued by leading man, Melvyn Douglas, who appeared opposite her in three talkies, making him her only repeated co-star in talkies (John Gilbert was to achieve the same distinction in silents and with his one talkie excursion with the Divine One, brought their co-starring occasions up to four). His attempts at love making eventually wear her down, but the efforts are hilarious. Her monotone voice and completly expression-less affect in the first half are marvelous as she reduces every piece of sensuality to uselessness in its impracticality. Finally a pratfall reduces Garbo to helpless laughter and the ice is broken. The Lubitsch touch is marvelous here - surprising he did not receive an Oscar nom for that. This is one of Garbo's best performances and one of her best films - one to see at all costs. Recently selected by AFI as one of their top 100 comedies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Garbo Laughs, and Makes Me Laugh with Her</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only word to describe this Ernst Lubitsch comedy is: sparkling.Tremendously sweet and funny in that gentle way that was unique to Ernst Lubitsch comedies, "Ninotchka" features a winning Greta Garbo as a Soviet envoy dispatched to Paris to check up on the work of her comrades. They have been sent to sell the confiscated jewels of a Russian countess, played haughtily by Ina Claire. She refuses to let them go without a fight, and enlists the help of her attorney and playboy (Melvyn Douglas) to win them back. Unfortunately for her, he falls under the charms of Ninotchka, as do we.I have never been a fan of Garbo or the moody brooding she was always asked to do in her films. Lubitsch completely understood the image she had in the public's collective mind, and so for the first half of this movie, Garbo presents a parody of herself, refusing to crack a smile despite Douglas's herculean efforts to make her. But then Ninotchka gradually begins to fall under the spell of Paris, its good food and fashionable hats, a pratfall involving Douglas is finally enough to make her laugh, and from that moment on, she's a delight. For an example of just how good a comedienne Garbo could be, watch Ninotchka's face as Douglas's character tells her corny joke after corny joke in an attempt to win a smile from her; or the scene set in a nightclub when Ninotchka discovers the capitalist wonders of champagne.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful Romantic Comedy and Funny Satire to the Fight of Classes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three Russian traders come to Paris to negotiate the jewels of a former Grand Duchess of the Russian empire. The former owner of the jewels, Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire), is exiled in Paris, and try to retrieve the possession through the French justice. Her lawyer and lover, Count Leon d'Algout (Melvyn Douglas), advises the Russians to wait for the sentence of the justice. Meanwhile, the Russian supervisor Nina Ivanovna Yakushova "Ninotchka" (Greta Garbo)" is sent to Paris to survey and evaluate the performance of the negotiators, and incidentally meets Count Leon d'Algout. They feel initially attracted for each other, and later they fall in love for each other. However, the Grand Suchess becomes jealous and their love become impossible due to the Russian closed political system. "Ninotchka" is a delightful romantic comedy and funny satire to the fight of classes. The chemistry between Melvyn Douglas, who has a magnificent performance, and Greta Garbo, gorgeous as usual, is amazing. The confrontation between the capitalism and socialism systems is exaggerated, labeled and caricatured, but very funny, provoking many laughs. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Ninotchka"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Problems of Capitalism v. Communism solved by Parisian Champagne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If any film is chosen by most people as the typical Ernst Lubtisch comedy, it is NINOTCHKA. TROUBLE IN PARADISE is usually pointed at as his best comedy, and his best musical comedy is THE MERRY WIDOW with Chevalier and MacDonald, but NINOTCHKA is the elegant comedy of some point that people recall. I think the real reason is that it is, for most people, the best known of Greta Garbo's movies (after all, she laughed in it), and it does dismiss Communism with such sweet aplomb.Actually it does not do so that well. It shows that given an opportunity to relax and speak one's mind, and not worry about informers and gulags, people will be happier. That is true, but one could also say (as Lubitsch would show in TO BE OR NOT TO BE, that a form of extreme capitalism mixed with racist ideals called Nazism could be just as deadly. Moreover, Leon (Melvin Douglas) does read up a bit on Marx and his theories, and has an interesting conversation with his elderly valet (Richard Carle). Douglas feels that Carle has been oppressed over the years as a servant. Carle, though, reminds him that while he does not mind that Douglas has not paid him in quite a while, the thought that in a Communist world he (Carle) would have to share his money with Douglas, frightens the hell out of him.Douglas is the lover of Grand Duchess Swanna (Ina Claire) whose property was appropriated by the Soviet Government in the Revolution. Her jewelry is now in Paris, in the hands of a trade mission led by Sig Ruman, Felix Bressart, and Alexander Granach. They plan to use it to get needed farm equipment for the Soviet Union. Douglas goes to work to corrupt the three men, which is not too difficult, so he can try to get his hands on the jewels for Swanna. But the Russians send an additional member to head the mission: Garbo as Ninotchka. She is quite hard nosed and business like. Ruman and company try to get her to understand what is going on is a good thing, but she keeps reminding what they are there for. She is not impressed that she is in the "City of Lights". Instead, on her first afternoon in Paris, she is determined to see the city's power plant! Douglas sees her and is instantly charmed, but she keeps resisting his efforts. Her background is quite different from what he is used to - we learn, for instance, that she actually distinguished herself in the Russo - Polish war of 1920 - 21, getting wounded, but killing the Polish soldier who wounded her (and comforting him as he died). She is not without a heart, but she is determined to do her duty. What finally breaks her down is not Douglas' attempts at romance, but his making a fool of himself trying to tell her a joke.She does break down, but she never loses sight of the reason for her mission. And she and Swanna finally reveal their willingness to sacrifice in a showdown scene, where the Grand Duchess gives up the jewels for Leon, while Ninotchka gives up Leon for the needs of her country.Leon too grows, determined to try to bring her back. The scene between Douglas and George Tobias is one of the funniest in the movie, as Douglas desperately offers to return to Soviet Russia, and Tobias (knowing what people like Douglas think of the Soviet regime) refuses to give him a visa (he might try to blow up a dam!).How he succeeds in the end I will leave to the viewer to find out. My only other comment is that this film is also recalled as the only time Greta Garbo shared a scene with Bela Lugosi, as her supervisor Commissar Razinin. It is only a three minute scene, and has only one funny line for Bela (describing the antics of Ninotchka's old mission buddies). He seemed stern and properly in control of his job, but he was far more funny in INTERNATIONAL HOUSE.Please also note Sig Ruman's comment to Garbo, asking her if she wanted to be alone. It is an interesting little reference to her most famous line of dialog from GRAND HOTEL, six years before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lovable Garbo, the Lubitsch Touch and Scintillating Wit from Wilder and His Cronies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it's a given that Greta Garbo was the most enigmatic of film stars during Hollywood's golden age, it's also fair to state that she may be the least relevant today for her austere beauty and cool, sometimes unapproachable demeanor. Yet, all that is erased with this 1939 comedy masterwork which brilliantly teams her with the master of innuendo-filled scintillation, Ernst Lubitsch. With a laser-sharp, witty script by Walter Reisch, Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder (before he became a master director himself), this classic is one part political comedy, one part screwball farce and one part romantic whimsy, all blended impeccably with the famous Lubitsch touch.The plot involves Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, a Soviet envoy sent to Paris to ensure that the government receives the proceeds from the sale of jewels once owned and still coveted by the Grand Duchess Swana, now an expatriate. The cold, emotionless envoy goes about superseding the three lesser envoys who have been assimilating themselves into the frivolous, capitalistic world of Paris thanks to Count Leon, a tuxedoed dandy and the duchess's constant escort. It is Leon who dubs the envoy Ninotchka, and after initial resistance, the two find themselves falling in love but not at the expense of her convictions about the omnipotence of Communist values. The jewels become a negotiation ploy that complicates their affair as does the Grand Duchess herself. The plot develops in unexpected ways and through such clever observational humor that the ending comes all too soon.While she is deified by many for the operatic tragedy of "Camille" and the mannered mystique of "Mata Hari", Garbo seems at first to be a parody of her sullen screen image with witty one-liners delivered in hilarious deadpan, but she, like her character, blossoms into a warm, comically romantic presence as the film progresses. It's a wondrous transformation and the one performance that assures Garbo her lasting stature more than any other. As Leon, Melvyn Douglas specialized in William Powell-knockoff roles like this one and while he does get a bit excessive in his 1930's-style romantic gestures, he is sophisticated and genial enough to have us believe Ninotchka may give up Mother Russia for him.At first, stage legend Ina Claire seems like she will play the Grand Duchess Swana as a dotty ninny, but when her talons show, she is an excellent match for Garbo in their scenes together. As the trio of envoys ensconced in the good life, Sig Ruman, Felix Bressart and Alexander Granach make a merry chorus to the proceedings. I particularly like the scenes back in Russia when they share an omelet dinner with Ninotchka in her Soviet-sanctioned, multiple-occupant room. The print transfer on the 2005 DVD is pristine and brings out William Daniels' sparkling, black-and-white cinematography, though the only extra is the film's original trailer. This is truly a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Works Much Better Than You Might Expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For having a rather odd combination of elements, "Ninotchka" works better than you would expect. It would be well worth seeing solely for the chance to see Greta Garbo in a comedy, and she herself comes off very well. The story is light but entertaining, and it is mostly enjoyable in itself, while also providing an interesting look at contemporary attitudes towards the USSR.Garbo shows that she can handle the light comedy well, and although her character's transformation is somewhat stylized, this seems to be deliberate, rendering moot the otherwise obvious questions of believability. Melvyn Douglas makes an unusual pairing for Garbo, and he only partially works. His style can often become overly ingratiating, and while there are movies where that style fits in well, it is less than ideal here. A different choice for the role might have changed the feel of the movie for the better.Garbo's three Soviet comrades are possibly the best part of the picture. Felix Bressart and Sig Rumann, in particular, are impossible to forget. The roles are well-written and are used well in the story. Bela Lugosi is also in the supporting cast, but unfortunately he does not get a lot to do. The implied commentary on the nature of the (then) fairly young USSR is of some interest in itself, in comparison with the later attitudes of the post-war era.Overall, while "Ninotchka" has some uneven stretches, it is quite an enjoyable and interesting film that generally succeeds with its offbeat mix of cast and material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic pre-war comedy-romance is packed with satire and laughter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ninotchka" is one of the funniest movies ever made. But it's not a slapstick or screwball comedy. It is in the class of "It Happened One Night," "My Man Godfry," and "Holiday." The humor is in snappy dialog. The one-liners, subtle zingers, and satire poke fun mostly at Soviet Russia and communism. But it has occasional jabs at capitalism and western lifestyles ? notably the idle rich. The movie is superb in all aspects, especially in the script, direction, settings and acting. All of the cast give top performances. Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas are the perfect match for some of the funniest repartee ever put on film. But, how Garbo (Ninotchka) could keep a straight face in those exchanges, one after another, is beyond me. I'll bet MGM had to do many retakes of some of her scenes. If not for her breaking down, then for the cracking up of Douglas (Leon) or others on the set and behind the camera. "Ninotchka" is one of the great comedy-romances for the ages. Young and old alike can enjoy it. But, from some of the comments I've read, it seems much of the humor is lost without a little knowledge of the time. So, I offer these tidbits to help set the stage and prepare viewers for a most enjoyable film. The time is the late 1930s. The story takes place mostly in Paris, moves to Moscow later, and ends in Istanbul. In 1939, all the world knows about Soviet Russia and many of its problems. It has been in the news since the communist takeover after the revolutions 20 years earlier. Joseph Stalin's five-year plan for recovery since 1922 was past its 15th year. So far, it had been an abysmal failure. His social programs had disrupted total populations. His collectivist farm program had failed miserably. Combined with drought and famine, the Russian people faced starvation.But that's not all. The Great Purge of 1936-38 had been in the news the past couple of years. It was Stalin's way to get rid of anyone who didn't agree with him or who might challenge his oppressive rule of Russia. The purge eradicated half a million Russian leaders. The press had covered the carefully staged mock trials in Moscow in that time. Many Russian communist and social leaders confessed to being traitors before they were sentenced to death or the gulags in Siberia. As all of that was going on and being reported from Russia, a number of former Czarist Russian royalty were living in exile around Europe, especially in Paris. Many stories and jokes circulated at that time about crown jewels and lost titles. Thus, the stage is set for "Ninotchka." With the large number of reviews posted up to this time, I wouldn't normally add my own. But, I think far too many people have missed the true depth of the satire and comedy in this great film. The IMDb Web site has a long list of witty dialog and exchanges from the film. But there are many more ? and some real subtle zingers that I think many people miss. Here are a few to whet your appetite. In an early scene, Ninotchka explains why Soviet Russia is "peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time." She says, "Our next year's crop is in danger, and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors, there'll not be enough bread for our people and you comrades." What a great example of skewered Soviet thinking. As if tractors could overcome a drought and famine. It's a great jab at the Soviets.Here's another one. Garbo looks over her hotel suite and says, "I'm ashamed to put a picture of Lenin in a room like this." And another, when her cohorts take her to the suite they reserved for her. "Which part of the room is mine?" Garbo asks. And a cohort replies, "You see, comrade, it's a little different here. They don't rent rooms in pieces. We had to take the whole suite." One more side-splitter was when her agents asked, "How are things in Moscow?" Garbo replied, "Very good. The last mass trial was a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians." A direct jab at Stalin's Great Purge. Douglas, meeting with the three agents early in the film, says that the jewels owned by the exiled duchess were confiscated by the Soviets. One of the agents quips, "I give you my word, they were confiscated legally." In a café later, a waiter seats Ninotchka and asks, "Now what shall it be?" She says, "Raw beets and carrots." He replies, "Madame, this is a restaurant, not a meadow." She next says, "Bring me something simple ? I never think about food." The waiter asks, "If you don't think about food, what do you think about?" Ninotchka answers, "The future of the common people." And the waiter replies, "That's also a question of food." What a great running dialog!"Ninotchka" was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Garbo for best actress and the film as best picture. That year may have been the best year in motion picture history for the number of great films produced. But for that, "Ninotchka" likely would have won two or more Oscars. More than 40 full length movies competed for 1939 Oscar honors. Among the best of the year were "Gone With the Wind," "Stagecoach," Goodbye, Mr. Chips," "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," "The Wizard of Oz," "Ninotchka," "Wuthering Heights," "Dark Victory," "Beau Geste," "Of Mice and Men," "Young Mr. Lincoln," "Gunga Din," "The Four Feathers," "Only Angels Have Wings," and "Bachelor Mother." Those top 15 films have a combined average viewer rating (on September 20, 2012) of 7.8. Has there been another year of more great movies than that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its a Comedy, Its a Romance, Its Garbo, Its well worth your time. Must See!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the average film audience, who only know the caricature portrayals of Garbo, this movie is a must see. Some people say her Russian accent in this movie is lacking, others say her rebirth from a cold monotone Russian diplomat to a free-thinking cheerful romantic is a problem. I say rubbish to both. Who cares about her Russian accent? And as to the rebirth, and sudden turn around, I find it refreshing and natural.Garbo's character is straight line Russian hard-line quips, until she meets Melvyn Douglas. He attempts to disarm her with suave sophistication, wit, and jokes. Although her demeanor does not change, she admits to feelings of love, but when she finds out Douglas is her nemesis she attempts to curb these feelings and break off the relationship. The change in her character does not occur (as some think) when Douglas falls off her chair and she laughs for the first time, it occurs the next day.The next day the humor in his joke finally hits her! (A man goes into a restaurant, and asks for a cup of coffee without cream. After 5 minutes the waiter comes back and says I am sorry, we have no cream, would you like a cup of coffee without milk?) Its as if she was an iceberg that finally hit its melting point.A classic movie, that is better viewed without assuming too many social implications...its a comedy! Melvyn Douglas is outstanding, in the role as a leading man, when he usually only plays supporting actor. Its a great movie, a part of film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lubitsch strikes again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best movies in perhaps the best year for movies is Ninotchka, a charming, romantic, yet full of smarts story about the vast differences between Soviet Russia and the capitalistic societies of the western world, in this case Paris, France. Greta Garbo gives a stark, blank-faced performance that is rather unflattering for a woman of her beauty as Ninotchka, a member of the Communist party that is sent to Paris to assist three other Russians in recovering some rare jewels from a former aristocrat in order to sell them for profit of the State. What she doesn't count on is meeting and falling for the smooth, spectacularly elegant Count Leon D'Algout, a lawyer for the Grand Duchess who falls head over heels in love with Ninotchka and slowly warms her cold heart.Simply put, this is a perfect and charming story. It moves along smoothly and effectively and it never makes a wrong turn. What may be most interesting about it is the amount of facts and information the screenwriters injected into the story. Today, any historical account of a past time would for the most part avoid discussing what actually happened and just stick to the present. Here, the film was released just as World War II was beginning and the Soviet Union was quickly becoming a major player in world affairs. There are large monologues where the characters are discussing the beliefs of the communistic society compared to a capitalistic society. Ernst Lubitsch directs with his usual wit and flair while also poking fun at serious subjects at the time. Garbo gives perhaps her finest performance and Melvyn Douglas has never been more suave. A true masterpiece of the Golden Age, Ninotchka is not to be missed by anyone who loves the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Garbo; lady of virtual mystery, proves all too briefly that she was adept at comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ernest Lubitsch's Ninotchka (1939) effectively rounded out Garbo's MGM tenure with a colossal bang. A scathingly funny romantic comedy, it stars Garbo as a Russian commissar who is dispatched to Paris when three of her fellow comrades are suspected of defection. Installed inside Paris's most opulent hotel, she soon discovers debonair playboy, Count Leon D'algut (Melvyn Douglas), a man of considerable suave sophistication who is at first in pursuit of the Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire), but easily switches in mid-ride to tackle the immense obstacle of melting Ninotchka's heart. Throughout, the film is peppered is charming dialogue and situations that continue to tickle the funny bone; such as the moment Leon, observing Garbo studying a city map, tenderly indicates for her where they are standing by taking Ninotchka's index finger in his hand. "Are you flirting with me?" she asks. "Absolutely," he declares. "Suppress it!" The image quality on Ninotchka is bar none the best in this box. A very clean, solid and nicely contrasted film like transfer with fine detail and a minimal amount of film grain all add to the sparkle of the occasion. The audio is mono but exceptionally well balanced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silk underwear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is easy to see why Paris must have been the last place to send a communist delegation to sort out the sale of precious jewels the Bolsheviks had taken from the aristocracy. Not only are the three comrades sent to perform the sale seduced by the luxuries they find, but in the process, their socialist ideology is quickly changed into becoming capitalists.When Ninotchka, a no nonsense woman, is sent to oversee the work of the comrades, she is appalled because of the decadence she finds! Ninotchka is, after all, a woman, so she cannot resist looking at a beautiful made hat, or enjoy the feel of silk underwear she had never worn in her life. Leon, who has been involved with Swana, the exiled Russian aristocrat, is enlisted to help her deal with Ninotchka, who represents the people that stole the family jewels and now are trying to dispose of them to anyone that can buy them. Leon is eager to please; he goes along in a game of his own trying to win Ninotchka, who at first resists his advances. But all is lost because the Russian woman ends up falling head over heel for the dashing Leon. Her transformation begins at this point. If there were things to make the hardest communist to waver, the taste of freedom and luxury prove to be intoxicating for Ninotchka.This was one of the best comedies that came out of Hollywood in 1939. Ernst Lubitsch did wonders in bringing Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett screenplay and turned it into a delightful film that has stayed as fresh as when it first was released. Of course, today audiences might react different because life in Russia is not what it was during the period that is presented in the film.Greta Garbo was a great as Ninotchka. She made a career in Hollywood playing dramatic parts, but she was amazing as a comedienne. Her timing was impeccable, as she clearly shows an uncanny talent for comedy. She was perfectly matched by Melvin Douglas, another excellent actor. Mr. Douglas is a joy to watch playing against the straight faced Garbo. The supporting cast included Ina Claire, Sig Ruman, Bela Lugosi, and Felix Bressard, among others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comedy jewel; the script and Garbo both sparkle like mad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Female sergeant from Russia (Greta Garbo) travels to Paris for the first time to clear up ownership battle over some Russian jewels; she meets and falls in love with a wealthy ne'er-do-well (Melvyn Douglas). Effortless, incandescent comedy-romance eschews the screwball slapstick of the day for witty, whimsical farce instead. It features a dazzling comedic performance by Garbo (she's quite at home in a comedy, and more personable than ever before on-screen). This was Greta's second-to-last movie; she would only do one more, "Two-Faced Woman", also with Douglas, in 1941. There are many classic scenes here to treasure: Garbo trying on her first Parisian hat, Douglas picking her up at the Eiffel Tower, Douglas making Garbo laugh. ***1/2 from **** Remade as a Fred Astaire musical titled "Silk Stockings" in 1957.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ninotchka" starts with three Russian men in Paris that have been sent to sell jewels confiscated in the Russian Revolution on behalf of the Soviet Union. They quickly fail in their duties because they become enamored with Paris life and encounter difficulties due to original owner of the jewels.The Soviet response is to send Nina Ivanovna Yakushova or "Ninotchka" to rescue the bungled mission. Ninotchka is, to paraphrase Gilbert and Sullivan, the very model of a modern Soviet envoy. She is an ardent communist and constrains herself to her duties. That is, until she herself becomes slowly enamored with Paris life and the Count Leon d'Algout.From the moment she appears, this film belongs to Greta Garbo as Ninotchka. She is dazzling and has perfect comic delivery both in her stern and rigid and romantic stages. However, Melvyn Douglas is also notable as the Count Leon d'Algout, and the chemistry developed between the two is perfect. The supporting performances are also memorable, particularly from the three Russian men that are initially in the film's spotlight.The humor in this film is consistently excellent and has two dimensions to it. First, it is funny as a romantic comedy. However, secondly it is also funny as a critique of the Stalinist regime in the Soviet Union, a prime example being when Ninotchka comments that there will be "fewer but better Russians" after "mass trials". Lastly, one other part that deserves note is an amusing effect in the film to show a change in a picture of Lenin. I was drawn into "Ninotchka" from start to finish, particularly due to Greta Garbo's performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greta Garbo And Ina Claire Play Some Hardball</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During those years before World War II when the Soviet Union and America became allies of convenience against the Nazis, MGM produced two of the best satires available about the Soviet Union, Comrade X and Ninotchka. For this reason and for the fact that it is the fabled film where Garbo laughs, the film is remembered.Alexander Granach, Sig Ruman, and Felix Bressart are three of Marshal Stalin's officials entrusted with selling some jewelry belonging to some former Russian royalty. But they linger too long in Paris, sampling a lot of the good living they can't get back in the worker's paradise. Due to their sloth, the real owner of the jewels, exiled Russian countess Ina Claire discovers they are in Paris. She dispatches her boyfriend and apparently doubling as a lawyer, Melvyn Douglas to serve them with a restraining order to prevent their sale.Counting on the fortune these gems would bring, another Soviet envoy is sent, Greta Garbo, who is quite a bit more business like than our previous troika. But unfortunately she meets up with the ever so charming Melvyn Douglas even before she realizes he's her adversary. It's too late though, Douglas's charm and Paris's enchantment have Garbo hooked.The publicity surrounding Ninotchka advertised the film as 'Garbo laughs'. She not only laughs, but she does one mean drunk act besides as she forgets to tend to business at some critical moments.Ernest Lubitsch directed Greta Garbo to her final Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. Unfortunately Garbo was up in the year of Gone With the Wind and she lost to Vivien Leigh. Ninotchka was also up for Best Picture, Best Original Story and Best Screenplay and could not break the Gone With The Wind hammerlock on Mr. Oscar that year.The screenplay was written by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder savored and saved some of his best barbs for his own film about the Cold War, One Two Three in 1961. Run them side by side one night and you'll see what I'm talking about.Garbo got the Oscar nomination and Melvyn Douglas was lauded for his portrayal of the charming French count who lures Garbo away from Communism and her duty. However I'd like to put a word in for Ina Claire who plays the countess. The woman whose world was lost in a terrible bloodbath and who was brought up in luxury, has a lot more steel in her makeup than we originally think. My favorite scene is her with Garbo where she plays one mean game of hardball in negotiating for her jewels. Ninotchka might well have been her finest screen moment.The Soviet experiment is now history, but Ninotchka the film remains a classic view of the west about that system and one charming romantic comedy with that famous Lubitsch elegant touch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Ninotchka, it's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Those were the days, my friends" back in 1939 when Hollywood made the comedies that were funny, classy, and sparkling. Ernst Lubitsch directed the screen legend, the dramatic star Greta Garbo in her first and the best remembered comedy, "NINOTCHKA". In the title role Garbo plays a Soviet envoy sent to Paris to check up on the lack of progress in a sale of the jewels that used to belong to the Grand Duchess Swana, the relative of the last Russian Tsar who now lives in exile in Paris. Initially a fanatical "Bolshevik" and the Ice Queen who never smiles, as the movie progresses, Comrade Ninotchka falls in love with Swana's good friend, playboy Leon d'Algout ( Melvyn Douglas) who tries to interfere with a sale. The first half of the film is among the funniest I've seen. The dialogs and remarks by Billy Wilder are simply sparkling: ___________________________________________________________________Ninotchka: We don't have men like you in my country. Leon: Thank you. Ninotchka: That is why I believe in the future of my country. Count Leon D'Algout: Do you like me just a little bit? Ninotchka: Your general appearance is not distasteful. Ninotchka: Don't make an issue of my womanhood. Ninotchka: The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians. _____________________________________________________________________When Ninotchka began to thaw, it became a little silly for my taste but the Moscow episodes (the omelet-dinner scene at Ninotchka's overcrowded apartment and her conversation with Bela Lugosi's Commissar Razinin) and the end were perfect again. Overall, if anyone had to make a funny and classy comedy making fun of the Russian Politics and fanatic "Bolsheviks", Lubitch, Wilder, and Garbo were the perfect artists for the task.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another gem from Greta Garbo and Ernst Lubitsch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you love Greta Garbo and Ernst Lubitsch, there is no real reason why you shouldn't like Ninotchka. Both have done a little better, Garbo with Camille and Queen Christina and Lubitsch with Heaven Can Wait, The Shop Around the Corner and especially Trouble in Paradise, but Ninotchka is nowhere near either's lesser works, if anything it's up there with one of the best for both.As ever with Lubitsch, it looks fantastic, with gorgeous cinematography, lavish costumes and especially the sumptuous settings that doesn't swamp the actors at all. Lubitsch's direction is not as ground-breaking as it was in The Love Parade(an excellent film by the way and very historically important), but it is never less than masterly with the Lubitsch touch always present. Then again Lubitsch was a consistent director, who's even his lesser work like Monte Carlo has its virtues. It's well and sympathetically scored, the story while somewhat familiar is endlessly charming, heart-warming and good-humoured and the characters are surprisingly likable(even Melvyn's Douglas's). Greta Garbo is magnificent, showing a gift for comedy, and Melvyn Douglas in one of his best performances succeeds in making a not always sympathetic character likable and his comic timing is always solid to excellent. Ida Claire is wonderfully icy and Sig Ruman, Felix Bressart and Alexander Granach are very funny. The star though is the superb, always sparkling and often hilarious script, with one of the credits being none other than one of the best directors ever Billy Wilder. The café scene is just wonderful.To conclude, Ninotchka is another gem from Garbo and Lubitsch. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ninotschka" is not only a typical Lubitsch-style romantic comedy, it is a satirical political movie. Greta Garbo excels in her performance as a Soviet-drilled inspector who undergoes her own transformation the longer she stays in Paris and the more she begins to have romantic feelings for the Count d'Algout. All characters have been finely developed and watching this black and white film becomes a nice afternoon or evening entertainment. Apart from this, we get a nice scenic impression of Paris in contrast to what the East, Moscow, was imagined at that time. With "Ninotschka", Ernst Lubitsch has created a very entertaining and funny love comedy which is certainly a must-see for all Garbo fans!</fullReview>

The scene where he tries to get her to laugh in the high point of the movie. After that everything changes. And that scene is really magical!So, she goes from being stern to being happy! The only thing I would change is I would make the transition just a notch more gradual. Because it really went from 0 to a 100 in a split second. But nonetheless, it worked great and I am happy it happened relatively soon, so that the movie has a dynamic range, and goes into lot's of different "moods". Besides wanting to see a more gradual and believable transformation of Ninotchka, I really have nothing more to say against it. I enjoyed it a lot! Wow! And this was made in 1939! Goes to show you, that really was the year when filmmakers got it all figured out. One of the best years for cinema to this day.Delightful! Funny! Engaging! Enjoyable!

		<shortDescription>my first Garbo feature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My introduction piece to the screen goddess Greta Garbo actually is her penultimate film, under Lubitsch's guidance and paired with a rakish but urbane Melvyn Douglas, Garbo is Ninotchka, a Russian envoy sent to Paris to deal with a jewelery trade, which is involved into a lawsuit thanks to her inadequate comrades. Though one has to wait for a good 20 minutes before Garbo's first appearance in the movie, the foreplay is jocund and pitches the overall comedic atmosphere in the sheer disparity between capitalism and communism. The opening gambit of three communists Iranoff (Ruman), Buljanoff (Bressart) and Kopalski (Granach), from heatedly conversing about whether or not stay in a luxurious hotel for the sake of the priceless jewelery they are taking with, until they unanimously decide to takes the royal suite since it has a big enough safe to contain the whole set, is the quintessential Lubitsch's touch, liberating lighthearted humor but with grace and sophistication, pinpointing the foibles of human nature with inviting proprieties, where in contemporary comedies, we have almost lost it all. When Garbo arrives (perfectly in her European accented English), she immediately dampens the farcical atmosphere with her icy sternness, but when she meets Leon (Douglas), the debonair Count who instantly falls for her in the very first glance, her communist root is going to be shaken in a romantic swooning which sounds a little impetuous to our narrow- minded fiction if one hold a conservative view on communist disciplines, she doesn't refuse Leon's kiss and even kisses him back in their first night. Then comes the tag-line "Garbo laughs" in the working-class eatery, Leon's jokes are practically duds, only slapstick is without any cultural boundaries. After a must-see wardrobe transformation to give Garbo the essential film star allure in a fancy restaurant and a t?te-?-t?te for their future plan, the two lovebirds are routinely to face some challenge, Garbo is at the most poignant in the scenes of the farewell phone call in the morning, while she utters her final goodbye, as for him, it just a casual "see you later". Then the film diverges to Moscow, introduces the austere life of Ninotchka under a radically different belief and social system, the non-hierarchic camaraderie and the yearning for western commodities co-exist under the same roof. After a cameo from Lugosi, the film satisfactory brings up the happy ending under a harmless plot device, it is a well-balanced comedy doesn't ruffle the feathers of politics. The film alters Garbo's usual screen persona and comedy is something very rare in her filmography, but it is a successful gamble, she has all the flair and charisma to make audience fall head over heels for her. A big plus is the chemistry between Garbo and Douglas, the latter is a smooth talker and a devout doer, that kind of prince charming in every girl's dream, devilishly likable. The film is a four-Oscar nominee (BEST PICTURE, LEADING ACTRESS included) and generically, a notch below Lubitsch's finest work (e.g. THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER 1940, 9/10) as the peerless conjurer of romance in comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My only other experience of Garbo was in the 1925 silent film "The Joyless Street", a rather somber picture that featured her charisma with strong body language and facial expressiveness. Apparently the tag line 'Garbo Laughs' was meant to convey a change in character from her ensuing screen roles, but it takes a while to get there. It's only when her charmingly aggressive suitor (Melvyn Douglas) falls out of his chair that the stuffy Nina Ivanova Yakushova breaks character and reveals a human being underneath a commissar's clothing.The film is billed as a comedy, but it's not of the laugh out loud variety. The film delivers it's humor in the witty dialog between Garbo and Douglas, along with the calculated antics of the three apparatchiks Ninotchka has been sent to spy on and see that their mission is successful. I don't know if the title 'Envoy Extraordinaire" was a legitimate one, but Garbo takes it seriously, to the point of declining a railroad porter to take her bags, citing the 'social injustice' of it all. There are a handful of these ideological viewpoints woven into the script; another was Ninotchka's observation that as a capitalist, Douglas's Leon D'Algout was the product of a doomed culture.Personally, I enjoyed the film, though I had a sense that it started to drag at the ninety minute mark or so. The resolution of the romance between Ninotchka and Leon would have required the Russian comrade to defect so in that respect it seemed somewhat contrived. But not any more so than having the Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire) simply give away her jeweled fortune to entice her rival away from Paris.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Garbo At the Top of Her Game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ninotchka (1939)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Terrific romantic-comedy about a stern Russian named Ninotchka (Greta Garbo) who is sent to Paris to look in on three men who were unable to sell some jewelry due to some legal issues. Once there Ninotchka strikes up a relationship with Leon (Melvyn Douglas) who has his own reasons for wanting the jewels. Director Ernst Lubitsch hits all the right moves with this film and turns it into one of the best of its type. It's easy to see why so many people consider 1939 to be the greatest year for movies and this one here is another one of the jewels from that era. Although I'd stop short of calling this a masterpiece, there's still no question that it features a legend at the top of her game and a terrific supporting cast around her. It's funny to see the original advertisements talk about Garbo laughing since this was a very rare thing. Just like her first talking picture, which MGM played up, the moment here when she finally laughs is just a classic scene and one of the most memorable. There are so many classic moments in this film but the majority of the credit has to go to Garbo who is simply wonderful. The stern way she plays this character is just so funny and her line deliveries are flawless. When it comes time for the character to break and have some fun the actress pulls this off remarkably well. It also helps that Douglas is so great in the film and perfectly plays off the actress. Ina Claire, Sig Ruman, Felix Bressart, Alexander Granach and Bela Lugosi are also very good in their supporting parts. NINOTCHKA is full of wonderfully funny moments from start to finish and it's easy to see why it's considered such a classic of its genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's curious to see in Ninotchka how all those stereotypes about communist Russia ? of a dour-faced, emotionless people obsessed with efficiency and bureaucracy ? were apparently well-established before the onset of the cold war in which they proliferated. But despite its clichéd characters and satirical script, Ninotchka isn't really about these stereotypes. The joke is really upon the screen persona of its leading lady Greta Garbo.Garbo didn't make many comedies, and given that her on screen personality was believed to be not dissimilar to how she presented in real life, it's perhaps surprising that she was willing to send herself up so. She pulls it off magnificently however, with a performance that gets increasingly excellent as the picture progresses, beginning with cold parody, moving on to comic lightness (her witty yet believable drunk scene is a highlight), and finally the aching emotional realism that made Garbo so mesmerising. The movie couldn't really exist without her input ? you need someone able to play up that steely façade and then break it down so neatly and with such good comic effect. Incidentally this is one of the reasons why the musical remake Silk Stockings is so poor.But it's not just Garbo that makes Ninotchka work. This is all round a high-calibre cast. Melvyn Douglas proves once again his versatility in what is among his funniest roles. His character in Ninotchka is actually rather sly and creepy on paper what with his rather overbearing way of flirting, but with Douglas he remains completely likable. Broadway star Ina Claire is very good too, conversely making her character totally unlikeable just with her very manner, and I find myself wishing she had done a bit more work in the movies. Then there are the trio who play the Russian emissaries ? Sig Ruman, Felix Bressart and Alexander Granach ? who are a lot like the comical bucolic figures you see in many of the early Ernst Lubitsch comedies from the 1910s.Ah yes, Ernst Lubitsch, the director of Ninotchka. What is striking as ever with Lubitsch is how good he is at showing off the décor in his pictures. Everything looks so pristine, so glittering, and it really gives the movie its character, just as many of Lubitsch's countrymen would give their pictures atmosphere with shadow and stark angle. But Lubitsch doesn't allow the sets to upstage the people, and in fact keeps Ninotchka firmly routed upon its characters by encouraging lots of restless movement around the room within a scene, which his camera dutifully follows, allowing the excitedness of the performances to dictate the pace of the movie.Of course much of the picture's charm lies in its sophisticated screenplay, adapted by Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett and Walter Reisch from a Melchior Lengyel story. And yes, superficially it is a satire upon the Soviet system, one which would probably have gone down better yet in the American political climate of the post war decades, although I think even the most hardened anti-communist would have to agree with Garbo's wondering "How can such a civilization survive that permits its women to put such things on their head" ? because that hat really is awful! And perhaps to some extent that satire does work both ways; after all the villain of the piece is Ina Claire's White Russian aristocrat. However, before long all the movie's political content becomes irrelevant. Through clever writing and flawless acting we become completely absorbed in Ninotchka's sweeping romance, its battle of wits over possession of the jewels and above all its good-natured humour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ninotchka" is screen legend Greta Garbo's penultimate film and her first foray into comedy. Garbo plays the title character, a dour Russian envoy sent to Paris in order to orchestrate a jewelry sale. Melvyn Douglas plays a Parisian Count who disrupts the sale and seeks to thaw Ninotchka's cold exterior.Garbo earned an Oscar nomination for her work here while Melvyn Douglas also gave a fine performance. The two make a fine pair and, along with the rest of the cast, make the most of a witty, Oscar-nominated script authored in part by Billy Wilder.Ernst Lubitsch's direction is attractive and the film is generally well done from a visual &amp; aural perspective.In the end, "Ninotchka" is a satisfying romantic comedy bolstered by some satirical touches. This elevates the film above other, less substantial efforts and likely played a part in securing the film's Best Picture Oscar nomination. Personally, I think that the comedic elements of the film have aged pretty well so I would not hesitate to recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts very well, but ends badly. From the outset the movie is funny - full of great one-liners and social observations. Also a great political satire - mocking the evil of Soviet Russia and the naivety and stupidity of communism with some great satire. Capitalism doesn't get off scot-free either: the superficiality of some elements of it are also exposed.The opening few scenes also give a great insight into the European zeitgeist of the mid/late-1930s, especially the competing forces of capitalism, communism and fascism/nazism.From this auspicious start, a monumentally great movie was in the offing. However, from a point the movie takes itself far too seriously as a romantic drama. Instead of a political satire, or just plain comedy, it becomes a schmaltzy romantic drama, and a fairly predictable and conventional one at that.Even the humour becomes tired, predictable, more-of-the-same, rather than the fresh, sharp comedy from the first few scenes. The final few scenes are quite dull.It's as if the writer, the legendary Billy Wilder, ran out of ideas about half way through.Good performance by Greta Garbo as Ninotchka. Her cool, humourless impression of a Russian bureaucrat was something to behold. Melvyn Douglas is the clown to her straight guy, and does it very well. The three bumbling Russian officials are also played well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Russians Are Coming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NINOTCHKA (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1939), directed by Ernst Lubitsch, ranks one of the finest comedies to emerge in what's regarded to be Hollywood's greatest year, 1939. It was also that very year where certain top-rated stars, having gone through a declining period, would recapture the status they once acquired some time ago. The legendary Greta Garbo happened to be one of them. After playing tragic heroines for MGM dating back to the silent era of 1926, it was time for Garbo to either retire following her last screen appearance of CONQUEST (1937), or do something completely different. A Garbo musical might have been interesting, but quite unlikely. A western? Not quite. Garbo in pistols and petticoats would definitely not be her style, though it did work for Marlene Dietrich in DESTRY RIDES AGAIN. A murder mystery? Perhaps. Or at least another love story might suffice? The next best thing to reinventing the Garbo image turned out to be a comedy. Screwball comedies were highly successful and common place during the latter half of the thirties. For this comedy, however, it had to be both funny and agreeable to public taste. Funny and agreeable it was. Under stylish direction from the man known for his "Lubitsch touch," and excellent scripting by Charles Bracket, Billy Wilder and Walter Reich, the comedy in question resulted to the title character bearing the Russian name of NINOTCHKA.Opening title: "This picture takes place in Paris in those wonderful days when a siren was a brunette and not an alarm - and if a Frenchman turns out the light, it was not on account of an air raid!" The story opens with Russian comrades, Buljanoff (Felix Bressart), Iranoff (Sig Rumann) and Kopakski (Alexander Granach), in Paris, on a mission from the Soviet Government to sell jewels once belonging to the Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire) with the money used for farm machinery. Their assignment is soon forgotten as the trio enjoy themselves in the company of beautiful barmaids. Also at the luxurious hotel is Alexis Rakonin (Gregory Gaye), a Russian count posing as a waiter, who informs the Grand Duchess of their activities. Swana then has her lover, Count Leon D'Algout (Melvyn Douglas), to assist by both filing a court injunction to prevent the selling of the jewels as well as showing the comrades a good time in order to forget why they're in Paris in the first place. Due to the long delay, the Soviet sends Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, better known as Ninotchka (Greta Garbo), to investigate. Having met Ninotchka at a crosswalk, Leon, unaware of her identity, immediately becomes fascinated by her. During her stay in Paris, Leon does everything to entertain her, from escorting her to the top of the Eiffel Tower to endless attempts in trying to make her laugh. When Ninotchka finally transforms into a new woman, trading her beret for a modern hat, she, too, forgets her assignment by concentrating on Leon. When Ninotchka mysteriously returns to Russia, Leon tries to follow her there, but is unable to obtain a Visa.For Garbo's introduction in American comedy, NINOTCHKA comes no better than this. She earned a well deserved Academy Award nomination for her performance. What makes NINOTCHKA work so well is the way Garbo delivers her comedy lines, in the same manner of her dramatic roles. Enacting it in a straightforward manner with no attempts of being funny is the secret to the hilarity. The more serious she is, the funnier she becomes. Of the many classic lines delivered here, with one being a little "in-joke" pertaining to Garbo's classic tag line of "wanting to be alone," the one that should get honorable mention is, "Do you want to see my wound." For Garbo's male co-star, Melvyn Douglas proved to be a most logical choice. His most classic scene comes as he helps his leading lady fulfill her much publicized slogan, "Garbo laughs!" She's laughed before on screen, but never so hysterically. A pity the Garbo-Douglas reunion comedy of TWO FACED WOMAN (1941) didn't earn the same reputation as NINOTCHKA. The now forgotten Ina Claire, better known more for her theatrical than screen performances, gives a good account of herself as the Duchess. It's a wonder how the sophisticated Genevieve Tobin might have done had she assumed that very same role. Horror movie fans will be surprised in finding the fourth-billed Bela Lugosi appearing as the Russian Commissar Razinin. Even more surprising how his one and only scene opposite Garbo to not only come very late into the 111 minute story, but one lasting a little less three minutes!As much as NINOTCHKA has been imitated and recycled throughout the years, only the musical remake, SILK STOCKINGS (MGM, 1957) starring Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse (Ninotchka) comes close in recapturing the success of the original. Distributed to video cassette in the mid 1980s and later onto DVD, viewers can capture a glimpse of the legendary Garbo laughing (and showing off her wound) in one of cable TV's many broadcasts on Turner Classic Movies.

		<shortDescription>Indeed No one Shall Say NINOTCHKA Is Bad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>?To me there is no question that the film that is most like my aunt, the way she was in real life' is NINOTCHKA" Gray Reisfield, Garbo's niece.Greta Garbo, to many as the Garbo who seduces in her unforgettable silents, who talks in her first talkies like "Anna Christie," the Garbo who walks or the one of reflective royal face but mostly Garbo as the dramatic, idealized pretentious lady who longs to be left alone. Yet, 1939 brought a change to her career and, consequently, to her image as a celebrity. At last, Garbo laughs?and the whole world would laugh with her? This is here, with her very first comedy NINOTCHKA, where the exceptional talent of the cold Swede goes with the marvelous potentials of one the very best entertainers, Ernst Lubitsch whose style has been described as "Lubitsch Touch," ? "a style that is gracefully charming and fluid with an ? ingenious ability to suggest more than it showed" (Leland A Poague).However, lots of viewers at that time must have been curious, more to say, worried if their "idea" of the actress, if their belief in her multiple talents would be seriously tested. Being accustomed to the Garbo of dramas, they had doubts whether they would accept the Garbo of comedy - in other words, if the great figure of melancholy may entertain, amuse, make people laugh. Nevertheless, those who doubted were truly astonished? The quotation entailed at the beginning of my review says clearly for itself. Most people will probably agree that this role was really for Garbo being the most unique and at the same time the most accurate for her personality as we can deduce from her niece's words. She did a splendid job as the Russian envoy sent to the Paris of "the times when a siren was a brunette?" to deal with serious issues. She beautifully expresses a "metamorphosis" from a communism idealist among her comrades into no traitor but a charming young lady in love with the handsome Leon (Melvyn Douglas). Among her best scenes, there is certainly the arrival in Paris when she condemns the "civilization." I also laughed genuinely at the moment when she makes Lenin smile? Here, there is a need to mention Melvyn Douglas who is very good as male lead portraying an eloquent man who takes all sorts of pains to bring out at least a bit of humanity from the automatic creature of propaganda. Their moments make for wonderful witty scenes and dialogs that you will not be able to find anywhere else. Just to mention Leon's jokes, Ninotchka's map or the messages of specific hours on the clock? The supporting cast, in particular Sig Ruman, Felix Bressart, Alexander Granach as the three comrades Iranoff, Buljanoff, Kopalski do memorable jobs portraying Russians who, at first, feel so strange in the capitalistic reality finding it odd but who later change so seriously that they are ready to run private business? They absorb some of the movie's amusing moments, especially the hilarious scene with the attractive waitress/waitresses. Ina Claire also crafts her role of Grand Duchess portraying her "jeweled behavior" of barely any authenticity and lots of vanity.However, there is something more about NINOTCHKA. It is a comedy at various levels, not only the aforementioned situational one, but also at the political, social and, from today's perspective, also at the historical level. It appears to be an accurate satire on communist regime, one of the first satires, but, at the same time, one of the bravest (mind you it is 1939) that should have been a cinema symbol of later Cold War years. The culture clash symbolized with the couple stands for two worlds, the world of utopia ideals and the one of individual efforts, the world of public nature of mankind and the one of privacy, the world of commands and the one of bureaucracy, the world where people need ideals to exist and the one where they need budgets to survive. Yet, ironically, it is love and only love that links the both.NINOTCHKA is a masterfully directed comedy, a must see that, as promotions once proclaimed, "Only Lubitsch could have made" with his historic Touch. Very few movie buffs shall say that NINOTCHKA has dated after these 70 years but indeed, no one shall frankly say that NINOTCHKA is a bad movie. Decide to see it and dine with its genuine humor which, like wine, gets better with time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Garbo between two worlds.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would not call NINOTCHKA controversial film. Political comedy in the late thirties by line developments were controversial. The differences between the two worlds are not likely to appear in the right way. I think that's good, because it is a comedy and Garbo. Lubitsch had chosen a great topic in which Garbo fits. Garbo between two worlds. The director deliberately exaggerating the degree of cynicism and comparisons. In a serious relationship director put a little thing called love. Not honestly, but it is funny. I still say that Garbo did not know laugh. Therein lies all the mysticism and magic that binds to her name. Image and scenery are very good. Acting and dialogues are great.Greta Garbo as Nina Ivanovna "Ninotchka" Yakushova It is a particular comedian. Her style is fantastic. Shifts between cold and uninterested envoy and playful girl in love is fascinating. Melvyn Douglas (Count Léon d'Algout), as an insidious capitalistic meddler is nonchalant and excellent paired with a leading lady.This movie is one big joke, which can all laugh. However, I think when the perceived political framework is little disposed to laughter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught this on Turner Classic the other night, and I found it to be a fun little movie. The story revolves around Greta Garbo's character, a Russian emissary who comes to Paris only to be wooed by her diplomatic counterpart.There is a large part of this film that can be viewed as mid-20th Century right wing propaganda. This movie was made as the Red Scare was coming of age--a dozen or so years before Joseph McCarthy would interrogate supposed Communists through the power of the US Congress. Yet this movie demonstrates that the anti-Communist movement was well under way by 1939. That said, the film goes about its task of lampooning the Iron Curtain quite effectively. Garbo offers a uniquely funny parody of Stalinism, and as the movie progresses it tells its tale well.All in all this is a classic film that is fun to watch and well made. I place it one notch down from the 9-10 rating I might reserve for a "Gone with the Wind" or a "It's a Wonderful Life", and so far as mid-century critiques of ideology are concerned, I'd probably prefer to see "Dr. Zhivago" over this movie as well (though that film is of a markedly different genre). Still, "Ninotchka" is a pleasure to watch--thus my 8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the core of this film is a dispute between the French and the Russians over which nationality a certain set of rich jewelry belongs to. Three Russians have obtained the jewels (legally from what I understood) although technically they had belonged to a powerful individual from France. The leading actor plays a Frenchman who is trying to make a compromise for both sides, but the three Russians want a consultant for themselves, so they hire the titular Ninotchka, a Russian woman devoid of all joy and happiness.The Frenchman meets this woman before finding out she is the consultant for the Russians, and as if it was fate, he falls for her. He is persistent to spend time with her, and even realizes she does not enjoy life as she should, so he attempts to make her laugh, but there is no success until he does something unintentionally - he falls over a table in a restaurant and it makes everybody, including Ninotchka, to laugh themselves silly.After this incident, things seem to change for Ninotchka, and she even laughs during very serious matters such as while she consults the three Russians about the dispute at hand. She truly enjoys life now and she comes to like the man, Leon, a lot, and eventually falls in love. This doesn't come about without some struggles, of course, but the heart of the movie effectively tells us that life is definitely worth enjoying.This being a comedy, I wish there was more and better humor involved, but this movie is delightful in that its message is inspiring and still does fine without "better" comedy.3.0/4.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ninotchka - 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casablanca has long been my favorite movie. Ninotchka has similar elements - memorable lines, romance, political overtones and satire , made 3 years earlier. Greta's face shows emotion even when she's not showing emotion. She foreshadows Spock! Her glance at an opulent store display speaks volumes. When the does laugh, the screen virtually splinters. Sally Field and Robert Osborne introduced this movie on TCM recently. Sally's insights are special, pointing out the comedic flair of Greta in several scenes, as when she's "executed". Communism and capitalism take their share of abuse; the contrast is portrayed and parodied. Greta even mentions "social justice", truly a modern leftist buzzword and a Marxist concept. Ninotchka is fun from the first scene to closing credits, with one last parting joke...to be interpreted in a number of ways. Melvin Douglas is superb, a Chevalier/Cary Grant type. Ina Claire was a stage legend and held up well versus Douglas and Garbo, high praise indeed. The 3 minute scene with Greta and Bela Lugosi is priceless. I gotta make room in my top 10 for Ninotchka; like her, I continue to crack up thinking back on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ernst Lubitsch has been my favourite discovery of the year. Having seen and loved To Be Or Not To Be and thoroughly liked The Shop Around The Corner, Heaven Can Wait, Trouble in Paradise and now Ninotchka, I regret to think I have little classics left from him. These five are satisfying enough. Scribed by his protégé Billy Wilder and co., Ninotchka is about as witty as you'd expect, if a little obvious at times in the characterisations and developments - but this wasn't exactly an era of subtle cinema, so it's easy to take as theatrical exaggerations. It wears the geopolitical allegories and conflicts proudly on its sleeve, knowing just how clever it is with all of its hints and comments. Although it may be perhaps too overt, it won me over with the performances and relationship between Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas - my first film of hers and first pre-1960 film from him - and they certainly deserve the acclaim that's endured a near century. Ninotchka is a great, enjoyable, and clever film that notes more things on the list of why I like Lubitsch so much.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ninotchka</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Ernst Lubitsch (To Be or Not to Be, Heaven Can Wait), I had heard the leading actress name a few times, I didn't know much about her, especially not that she retired at the age of thirty five after only twenty eight films, and I was looking forward to this title I recognised from her career. Basically in Paris, France, three Russians, Iranov (Sig Ruman), Buljanov (Felix Bressart) and Kopalsky (Alexander Granach), are selling jewellery from the aristocracy that they confiscated during the 1917 Russian Revolution, and arriving they meet Count Leon d'Algout (Melvyn Douglas) who is trying to retrieve her jewellery back for Russian Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire). But he corrupts the three men and convinces them to stay in Paris since they have become accustomed to their French surroundings, so special diplomatic agent Nina Ivanovna "Ninotchka" Yakushova (Oscar nominated Greta Garbo) has been sent by the Soviet Union to make sure the sale goes ahead and bring the three men back to Russia. She is stern and non nonsense with her attitude, and for a while she has no time to mess around with pleasure rather than business, but after meeting Leon and being introduced more to the culture of the West she lightens up. Ninotchka and Leon slowly fall in love with each other, and this allows the three Russians to do a kindness for capitalism, and in the end the Russian agent leaves behind her work to have a relationship with the Count, and one of the three men protects that the other two were unfair to him, this is a joke. Also starring Bela Lugosi as Commissar Razinin and Gregory Gaye as Count Alexis Rakonin. Garbo gives a great performance as the first strict and then light-hearted Russian agent, and Douglas is likable as the charming man and love interest, I will confess that I could not understand the political stuff and I could not follow everything going on, but I did laugh when the jokes were simple and well made, the most funny material is during the café scene, and the love story is nice, so it was an fun sophisticated comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Picture, Best Writing, Original Story and Best Writing, Screenplay. Greta Garbo was number 5 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and she was number 44 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 52 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lubitsch and Garbo Were a Great Match</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from John Gilbert, the only other actor who could stand up to the Garbo mystique was Melvin Douglas, in this. I'd seen this movie years ago but had forgotten everything about it, so it was like seeing it for the first time. It's not as perfect as "Queen Christina," but it's certainly a great film, and Garbo oozes with charm. There are some scenes between her and Douglas that you just want to go on forever. Directed with style and wit by Ernst Lubitsch, with a lot of Billy Wilder's touches (who was screen writer). The three Russian guys are Wilder all the way. The film reminded me of "Ball of Fire" (directed by Howard Hawks, but written by Wilder), and Wilder's "Love in the Afternoon." There are some scenes that feel a bit forced like Ninotschka's initial one-note Russian proletariat no-smile act, and her overdone laughing fit at Douglas' fall in the restaurant. In fact, the irony of the laughing scene is that although the studio advertised the film as "Garbo laughs!" her laughter - at least in this scene - was dubbed. Still, she has many other moments where her amused reactions are both natural and infectious. The romance between Garbo and Douglas works great and the sets and locales all add to the atmosphere. The plot, which seems predictable at first, takes some interesting turns. Garbo's evolution from Russian proletariat to loving woman corrupted by the west is pitch perfect. The film is just full of entertaining scenes. Loved it.And so why didn't Garbo do more films with Lubitsch? Well, it seems the star's career decisions were so frivolous she might just as well have consulted an astrologer. With "Ninotchka," Garbo had found a director in Lubitsch who knew how to use her persona, and she was told to continue with him in more films. Bizarrely, she took the advice of an actress friend, Salka Viertel (Garbo's co-star in the German version of "Anna Christie"). Vieretel told Garbo she should not return any of Lubitsch's calls. And so Garbo didn't and never acted in another Lubitsch film. In fact, her next film, "Two-Faced Women," was her last, directed by George Cukor, apparently trying to be Lubitsch, and though it's a lot better than its reputation, it bombed when first released. Following that, Garbo left Hollywood forever, apparently, never looking back.</fullReview>

I really enjoyed this film, I doesn't care if it's dated or not because the themes are timeless. I really enjoyed Melvyn Douglas' performance, although Cary Grant would be excellent but I personally don't think that Cary Grant can hold his own against The Divine Garbo. Would I rank this film in my top 10 list? No. But it's just fun to watch it and it's wonderful to see Garbo in comedy, after starred in long list of tragedy films. This is defintely good start if you want to be Garbo fan because her earlier films can be bit tad harder to watch. Check this out. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tenderized Comrade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this film first, perhaps twenty years ago, I was so ignorant of things Russian that I thought the Garbo character had actually been christened Ninotchka and/or it was a genuine Christian name. Since then I've learned that Russians have a charming habit of 'tenderising' names by adding a suffix so that Nina, for example, can be 'tenderized' to Ninotchka. I saw the film again recently in Paris where one Art House in particular seems to run virtually continuous Lubitsch retrospectives. When I saw it recently I knew that Ninotcka had been christened Nina and you know what? It didn't make that much difference. It was a GREAT movie when I saw it first and it's STILL a Great movie, tenderizer or not. I'm also slightly astounded that on the credits on this Board the name of Billy Wilder is omitted (unless, you click on 'more') which is not unlike omitting the names of Lubitsch and Garbo because apart from the Lubitsch 'touch' the Wilder touch is evident in every frame. On this board you will find a large selection of 'quotations' from the film, arguably as many if not more than yielded by Casablanca and in every one the caustic tongue of Wilder is clearly detectable. In fact the whole film reeks of Wilder and his penchant for what we might call the cyanide soufflé, the light-as-air romantic comedy laced with cynical barbs directed - in this case - mostly at the Russia of Stalin. I've looked in vain for a dull moment, every observation is right on the money, the characters are flesh and blood as opposed to cardboard and the leading character undergoes the obligatory volte face two thirds of the way through. The thirties provided some of the all-time great movie comedies - not least two of Wilder's own in Bluebreard's Eighth Wife and Midnight - but this is the one they all have to beat. Rating? Off the chart.</fullReview>

The movie must have gave people some insight into what was going on with the Soviets at that time. She eventually begins to soften a little with some work by her co-star Melvyn Douglas who happens to be falling in love with her. The story is somewhat basic but does have quite a bit of humor that brought on more than a few chuckles. Eventually Ninotchka eyes begin to open and she sees that she's been wrong in thinking that socialism is the way of the future. This is one of the last films that Garbo ever made, she made one more.

		<fullReview>This is the first picture (well, I'd seen a bit of Grand Hotel and I thought she was a terrible actress - really overacting and everything) I'd seen Greta Garbo in. I'd even ordered her biography yet never seen a movie she made. I was pleasantly surprised with 'Ninotchka' (of course, Greta Garbo) - cold, wooden woman who comes to Paris on business. However when she meets a man - Count Leon d'Algout (Melvyn Douglas) she comes out of her shell, becomes relaxed and falls in love with him. Garbo is very good at both the wooden woman and the free, in love girl. But she has to compete for his affections when the Grand Duchess Swana moves in on him.This is her first romantic comedy and she's very good in it - shows her comedic abilities. Watching Garbo laugh is priceless. A very fun movie fit for the whole family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why can't there be actresses today like Greta Garbo?? Certainly, she will live on forever, and Ninotchka is one of the movies that will make her live on so. Ninotchka is delightful, funny, a charming Lubitsch film. It's also one of her only (2?)comedies, and I believe, her only good one. If you are a Garbo or classic movie fan, it is quite a different experience from watching her in Grand Hotel or Camille, showing another side of Garbo. It's also great fun! See it, and be charmed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Garbo as comedienne.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anyone believes that Greta Garbo could not do comedy, then watch this movie. Not only does Ms. Garbo do comedy, she makes people laugh. In fact, her performance is at times hilarious. This movie, which is a satire of the Soviet system, is brilliant. Besides being funny, the chemistry between Ms. Garbo and her co-star Melvyn Douglas is great. He and Ms. Garbo make a great comedy team. And the story itself is wonderful. Using the Soviet Union as the source of jokes is risky but the movie deals with the subject in an entertaining manner. Ms. Garbo is beautiful, witty, poignant and charming. The rest of the cast is also superb, and combined with excellent cinematography and a strong script, they combine to produce an excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Ninotchka, it's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it a little odd that, on the cusp of WWII, Hollywood delivered a piece of anti-Communist propaganda, when clearly there were, at that time, more immediate threats to European freedom. 'Ninotchka (1939)' was produced while Ernst Lubitsch waited for Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart to become available for 'The Shop Around the Corner (1940),' but it was by no means merely a fill-in project: the film was Greta Garbo's first and only collaboration with Lubitsch, and the actress' penultimate role before a premature retirement. MGM's publicity campaign used the tagline "Garbo Laughs!" to advertise that this was a new type of role for the enigmatic actress, a comedy that promised to humanise her otherwise somber screen persona {this campaign deliberately referenced the tagline for Garbo's 'Anna Christie (1930),' which had proclaimed "Garbo Talks!"}. Though the screenplay by Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett and Walter Reisch unsurprisingly has many genuine sparks of wit, the balance of romance, farce and political commentary never quite sits as comfortably as one would expect given the talents involved.When three Soviet diplomats (Sig Ruman, Felix Bressart and Alexander Granach) arrive in Paris to sell off some jewelry confiscated from the Grand Duchess (Ina Claire) during the Bolshevik Revolution, they find it difficult to keep their minds on their work. Far away from the cold, drab apartments of Moscow, the French capital is bustling with life, warmth and prosperity (just forget that the French upper-class are not, in fact, a reasonable yardstick for comparison with the Soviet proletariat). Playful aristocrat Léon (Melvyn Douglas), the Duchess' romantic lover, succeeds in corrupting the bumbling diplomats by flaunting the luxuries of capitalistic society. To ensure that the transaction goes through smoothly, the Soviets send down Ninotchka (Garbo), a curt, tight-lipped Bolshevik with a militant hatred of Capitalism and everything it stands for. Against all odds, the debonair playboy Léon and the belligerent Ninotchka fall for one another, an attraction that ultimately proves more significant than one's national allegiance.Unfortunately, once love softens the formerly stone-faced Ninotchka, the film shifts from being a lighthearted political farce {not unlike 'To Be or Not to Be (1942)' or Wilder's 'One, Two, Three (1961)'} to a weepy romance. Lubitsch followed 'Ninotchka' with 'The Shop Around the Corner.' What worked so well in the latter film, I thought, was that Lubitsch's heart was not necessarily with the star-crossed lovers ? James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan ? but with Frank Morgan's shop owner, and his familial relationship with its employees. The three reluctant Soviet diplomats in 'Ninotchka' are utterly charming supporting characters, but too often they are shunned in favour of the central romance, which seems to tread water once, as advertised, Garbo breaks character and enjoys a hearty chuckle. Nevertheless, Melvyn Douglas is magnificently debonair, bringing something distinctly likable to the role of a lazy playboy aristocrat. During her opening act, you can almost see a smile forming beneath Garbo's icy exterior, and she plays the role with just the right amount of breeziness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly amusing movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ernst Lubitsch was a good genre director, who made more fun movies like this around the same time. He already began his career way back in 1914 as a director, in his native Germany. Writer and acclaimed director Billy Wilder, who co-wrote the screenplay for this movie always had regarded him as one of his favorite directors. His style, called 'The Lubitsch Touch' was even a well known phrase at the time. The movie features some great humor, which makes this movie a very amusing one to watch. This is thanks to Lubitsch's but also really thanks to its script with some fine, comical written dialog in it.It's the kind of movie in which the story is more secondary. Having said that it doesn't mean that the movie has a bad story though. It's a quite good story on its own right and basically one fine and effective story to build a good and fun movie around, like this movie turned out. But besides being a comedy the movie of course also still is a romantic one and a quite good and original one I must say, which is mostly due to Greta Garbo's character and her performance, in one of her last movie roles till her early retirement.Greta Garbo deserved an Oscar for her role in this movie but unfortunately she only received a nomination. She plays a tough, cold, stereotyped Soviet official, who melts for the charms of the Melvyn Douglas character. She plays it in an entertaining way, without falling into comical and overdone clichés. Melvyn Douglas was also truly great in the movie and he and Garbo formed a great couple in this movie. The movie also features Bela Lugosi, in a rare comical role. Not that his role is anything too comical though. He probably is the most serious character out of the movie. His role is also quite small really and only is in the movie for a couple of minutes, at the very end of the movie.The movie can also be seen as a satire on the former Soviet union and the different social classes. East meets west in this movie and the movie doesn't leave an opportunity wasted to make fun of both worlds but without ever getting offensive or crossing the edge. It's a fun satire, rather than one that is trying to make a statement with it.Delightful movie!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An utter delight!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Delightful romantic comedy from the master Lubitsch, with Garbo giving another excellent performance as the title character. She's the Russian envoy who comes to 1920's Paris to fix the mistakes of her three comrades who have been seduced by Western ways, and have failed to fix a deal to sell some jewellery belonging to the former grand duchess (Ina Claire). Garbo, at first stern and formidable, gradually melts for charming Melvyn Douglas. There is a romantic complication when the duchess forces the loyal Ninotchka to return to Russia so she can steal Douglas back, but Douglas wants only Garbo and by the film's end they are together again in Turkey.An enchanting film, it sparkles with wit and has an amazing screenplay penned by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett. Garbo is divine, showing great comic timing and creating another indelible, individual character. Garbo didn't just play Garbo all the time! Ninotchka may be my favourite Garbo performance so far. Douglas at first seems an unlikely man for Garbo to swoon over, yet he grows on you and he really is very good in his role. Wonderful Felix Bressart, a Lubitsch favourite, almost steals the film as Buljanoff, one of the three inept yet lovable Russian trio. A lovely film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The last mass trial went very well. There will be fewer but better Russians." (Ninotchka)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, 'Ninotchka', a comedy set in the aftermath of the Bolshivek revolution. Set in Paris after the first world war, and before the second, Russsia was struggling with poverty and various assets are being sold around the world. Three envoys from Russia are sent to Paris to sell jewels that had been seized from the Grand Dutchess Swana, now living in Paris along with Count Leon (Melvin Douglas), whom she wishes were more romantic towards her. When the three Russians are overheard talking about the jewels, Leon approaches them to strike a "deal". He takes them to lunch and gets them drunk, so that they agree to send a wire to Russia seeking permission for the "deal." Instead, a new, tougher comrade is sent, Ninotchka (Greta Garbo), intending to settle this in court. The hungry Russians need to be fed.Things get complicated when Count Leon falls head over heels for Ninotchka, romances her, kisses her ("That was very relaxing", she responds), and before long they are in love with each other. But the Grand Dutchess hasn't given up, she makes her own "deal", she will sign over all the jewels which she somehow managed to confiscate from the safe in Ninotchka's room, if Ninotchka will take the next plane back to Russia, so that she can't have Count Leon.We see her and her comrades back in Russia. Count Leon tries to gain entry into Russia but is refused. Later Ninotchka gets sent to Constantinople to check up on the three, after reports that they may be into mischief. There she finds Count Leon, they reunite and stay together.The dialog in this movie is very snappy and very funny. "Did you hear the one about the man who ordered coffee without cream. About five minutes later the waiter returned and said, I'm sorry but we don't have any cream, would you like that without milk instead?" I was very impressed with Garbo, she was great as the tough, humorless Russian, and she was equally great as the smiling, carefree love interest of Leon's later in the movie. She was as good a comic actress as any of the classic female stars. And Melvin Douglas was equally superb as the fast talking, romancing Count Leon. Bela Lugosi makes a quick appearance in one scene as Commissar Razinin, Ninotchka's superior.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming Satire Pitting Playboy Melvyn Douglas Vs. Red Greta Garbo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The famed "Ernst Lubitsch touch" as exemplified in this film consists of his European sense of dignity leavened by humor drawn from first-rate actors and absurdist situations, ironies, etc. This film revolves about Nina IIanovna Yakushova--"Ninotchka"--played by Greta Garbo.&nbsp; She is sent as a Soviet Russian agent to Paris, to attempt to retrieve jewels claimed by the USS, removed by Grand Duchesss Swana (Ina Claire). There are&nbsp;three agents already in place, Iranoff (Sig Rumann), Buljanoff (Felix Bressart) and Kopalski (Alexander Granach), whom she finds thoroughly converted to western ways, living in luxury.&nbsp; She also meets Count Leon d'Algout (Melvyn Douglas), who is a ne'er-do-well playboy of good character serving the Grand Duchess. From the first, he is enchanted by the lovely girl he senses underlying the humorless uniformed commissar, to whom he shows Paris.&nbsp; Humor is derived from Ninotchka's refusal to fall in with the lapsed trio of agents' acceptance of western ways and more engendered when the literal commissar tries to deal with Leon's advances, temptations, sarcastic rejection of her nose-to-the-grindstone service to the people of her sadly tyrannized homeland. She does not report her 3 subordinates, and accepts a date with Leon, who takes her to a restaurant. There he tells her a jest; she does not laugh and he accuses her of having no sense of humor. Everyone else present laughs at it the second time he tells it; then he leans back, the chair falls, and she laughs-- and after a while so does he...The next day, during a business meeting, she laughs at the previous night's joke. After the meeting, she puts on a silly hat she has bought, after turning down a trip through the Paris sewers. And later, at Leon's apartment a second time, she ask about a silver-framed photo she has seen, of the Grand Duchess--she is actually jealous, and they are in love, they admit... Next night, he takes her to a huge nightclub where Swana and her party spot them. They drink champagne and the two women exchange bitter words. Ninotchka gets tipsy and tries to organize a revolt among the powder room girls. At his apartment, she feels so guilty about being so happy, he stages a mock execution of her then puts her to bed. Next day, the Grand Duchess shows up--and the jewels, which were being kept in Leon's safe, are gone. She makes an offer--she will return the jewels if Ninotchka gets on the early plane. Leon makes a date with her by phone, knowing nothing; but she goes. The Grand Duchess breaks the news to Leon. He tries to get a passport, for reasons of love, and fails. Immediately, after a brief moment on the plane, we are shown a May Day parade in Moscow, with Ninotchka marching stone-faced among many other, amid posters of Stalin and Lenin. Then making her way through ragged children and a mob, she makes her way up to her apartment, which she shares with two other girls, a military officer and a strange fellow who wanders through and stops all conversation. We meet one roommate, a cello player, who worries about her--her Parisian slip was noticed in the wash as "subversive". She gives it to the girl as a wedding present, after trying to explain that people wear more than one set of clothing a day in the outer world. Then Bujanoff, Iranoff and Kopalski arrived for dinner-- they've saved enough eggs for an omelette. They remember Paris; then a letter fro Leon arrives--censored out of existence. Soon after at work, Ninotchka reports she has completed her research and is working on the second part. Her boss (Bela Lugosi) orders her to check on a shocking report--her three friends, sent to Istanbul on the strength of her report, are running wild. She begs not to go; he says, "Go". The three meet her at the airport; they have defected, and opened a restaurant. What follows is a satisfying ending, beautifully acted and scripted. Cinematography for this witty satire was provided by William H. Daniels (as William Daniels), art direction by the great Cedric Gibbons, and&nbsp;set decoration by legendary Edwin B. Willis. Music was done by Werner H. Heymann, with art&nbsp;department work by Randall Duell and gowns by Adrian. Writing credits go to Melchior Lengyel (for the story), Charles Brackett &amp; Billy Wilder, and Walter Reisch. In the cast Melvyn Douglas is award quality, Garbo and Ina Clair as Swana are quite good. Sig Rumann steals every scene as Iranoff, along with his partners. The most difficult aspect of the script, the handing of Ninotchka's ideas, is done as idealism, the specifics of Russia as shown betraying or belying those ideas. Charming and memorable comedy, well-acted,beautifully photographed by my standards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this 10-15 years ago, it was my first look at the famous Greta Garbo and I was impressed She was a pretty woman who exhibited class and intelligence, reminding me of Ingrid Bergman, although not as pretty.There are a number of subtly-funny lines in here which kind of characterizes the film: okay bit a little slow-moving and not what it could be if it just had a little more a spark to it. The dialog from Melvin Douglas and Ina Claire really date the film. Douglas, as he was in a lot of movies I've seen with him, is not a likable guy. He can be very annoying, but some of that is because he's doing such a fine acting job."Ninotchka" develops into a nice romance story in the second half of the movie with a short, satisfying ending and a pointed comment about living in Russia, at that time, as opposed to a free country. I don't own this movie but it was worth the rental.</fullReview>

We can feel the ambiguous attitude of the American people (and furthermore Lubitsch and Wilder as European immigrants) toward the Soviets in the unfolding events of Nazi aggressiveness in Europe. Paris's seductive as it can be, Garbo shine above all and the movie is fun to watch even from seven decades forward.To my opinion, someone who want to introduce himself with this 'Golden Age' of Hollywood cinema can easily be exposed by this film.</fullReview>

In my opinion, he's unfunny, unbelievable, and unattractive. I am told that his latter movies are much better, but I have not yet mustered up enough courage to see these. However, I can tolerate him in Ninotchka. I'd even go as far to say that I like him, and I can believe that Garbo's Ninotchka would be drawn to him. After all he's completely different from any man she's ever known, and most people are attracted to the new and exciting. The banter between the two is hilarious, and the supporting characters are just as funny and interesting, if not more so. In addition to all this, it has the funniest ending scene ever filmed. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This takes place in Paris before Word War II. A Russian envoy named Ninotchka (Greta Garbo) arrives there in a diplomatic battle for some jewels. She's a no-nonsense, humorless, stern woman. Suave Leon (Melvyn Douglas) falls in love with her and manages to draw her out. But evil Swana (Ina Claire) wants her gone and her jewels.This was advertised with "Garbo laughs!" She does indeed but that's not the only reason to see this movie. It's beautifully done with a sharp funny script. There's plenty of anti-Russian remarks but that has to be taken as a sign of the times. The acting really puts this through. Douglas is as good as anyone can be in his role--he really isn't given much to work with. However Claire is wonderful in her role and Garbo is just excellent. She transforms from a stern, humorless woman into a beautiful, delightful one totally believably. She plays off Douglas very well. Also look for Bela Laugosi (seriously!) in a small role as Razinin towards the end. My only complaint is that it's far too predictable and it's a little slow at times. Still, this is well worth seeing. Avoid the horrid musicalization of this called "Silk Stockings" from 1957.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ninochka is a multi-level film. At the centre of it is Greta Garbo playing the title lead. In this role she satirises her film persona which is viewed by many viewers as serious if not austere. This satirising of her persona is more apparent when she guffaws at Leon (Melvyn Douglas) when he performs his pratfall, by tumbling from his chair at the 'workers' canteen'. In other words she is poking fun at her public image, and the audiences gullibility for taking that portrait as the real Garbo. Moreover, it is her austerity within the context of this comedic film which makes Garbo's role as Ninotchka work so well.On the surface the film's story is a critique of communist Russia in the 1930s. However, if the viewer looks beyond the surface, the film's story can be viewed as a critique of Western perceptions of Russians, and Starlinist style Soviet communism at the time. As such the film satirises the viewers' ideas of national stereotypes and how it affects and shapes their views of nationals of other countries.Overall the film is daring in its approach; well directed with excellent acting, particularly from Garbo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Romantic Communist Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is amazing to think that Ninotchka was made back in 1939. To think, a romantic comedy made in America about 2 people falling in love. One, an American Capitalist and the other, a straight forward Communist. The end result, a funny love story that is still fresher than ever, even after 63 years. This is one of very few films that looks at Communist Russia years before America will Allie with them to fight Nazi Germany a few years later. For the audience of 1939, this is one of very few views that American public had at what Russia was. This is media entertainment at its finest. You have a comedy, that deals with its main plot of love. Then again, you have an amazing political movie, that influenced the public on who their foreign friends were. To think, Ninotchka could have unknowingly influenced the masses to unite with Russia during the 2nd World War.</fullReview>

The ending is funny and memorable. One of the ten or twenty best movies made by Hollywood. It deals with a very relevant subject in a very tasteful and witty manner, and one is willing to forgive its comparing Soviet realities with capitalist ideals. Objections: Too many Hollywood movies feature absurdly, blindingly good-looking actors, and romance must always interfere with everything. This movie should have starred Silvia Sidney (who is of Russian origin), and the romance should have been set aside. It is okay for American men NOT to get every foreign woman!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Pro-Communist Film Hollywood Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People expect this film to be anti-communist and so they read into it what they expect. However, if we look at it dialogically, as the literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin would suggest, we see that it is a film that totally subverts capitalist ideology.It is the good communist Ninotchka who is the hero. She is the role model for the film. She does undergo change, from a heroic communist who is dogmatic about making society a better place and has a slightly grim personality, to a communist who is still interested in making a better society, but who also enjoys the moment. She becomes a more well rounded communist, not an anti-communist as the standard anti-communist reading of the film suggests.From the first moment we see comrade Ninotchka, the viewer admires her strength and self control. She is an idealist with the ability to apply down to Earth solutions to real problems. She recognizes that the cost of her hotel suite is a "cow per day". She recognizes that her three comrades are ripping off the state, but she also recognizes that reporting them might lead to their deaths. They are fools, but not deserving of so severe a punishment, so she files a false report. This is even before she gets "seduced" allegedly by a lawyer played by Melvin Douglas.Ninotchka is throughout the film a strong, smart, scientific, curious and decisive women. It is hard to think of a better role model for a woman in any 1930's movie - and the movie makes this clear while she is still in her dogmatic communist phase.The most revealing line of the film is when she quizzes her would-be seducer and asks him what he has done for mankind. He admits to doing nothing, but making a joke out of it, he says that he does things for womankind. She suggests that his life is a waste and boasts that after meeting him, she now knows that her way of life will triumph. It is said without a trace of irony. She has nothing but disdain for those who only think of themselves.As the seemingly wealthy Douglas seduces Ninotchka and gets her to laugh and wear silly hats, he is also seduced by her. It turns out that he is a capitalist who is really broke. He hasn't paid his butler in two months. He starts to read Marx's "Kapital". By the end of the movie he gets rid of his butler and wants to follow Ninotchka back to Russia, willing to give up capitalism to follow the comrade he loves. The only problem is, the Russian bureaucrats will not let him in the country. They are suspicious of his desire to help them and believe he wants to sabotage them.It is the Grand-Duchess, the white-Russian counter-Revolutionary who is the real villain in the movie. She tries to insult Ninotchka when she sees her wearing a Parisian dress by snidely saying, "Oh, is that what they're wearing in Moscow, this year?" Ninotchka, gives the fabulous come back line, "No, this is what we wore last year," showing her communist pride that Moscow is not a whit behind Paris in fashion.In every encounter, it is Ninotchka, the faithful communist who gets the better and last line. Ninotchka does fall in love, but one can read this as making her a less dogmatic, even more appealing and well rounded communist.Even the ending has been misread. Douglas says that he could not get into Russia, so he had to get her out. We may read this as his saying that since he couldn't get into Russia to marry his communist comrade, he had to get her out. In other words, Stalin's Russia keeps true communists living under appalling conditions. We need to get real communists out of Russia so they can spread communism throughout the world.This movie is quite honest about conditions in Russia in the late 1930's. It was gripped by a wave of paranoia among poor living standards. This movie shows that, but it doesn't mistake that for communism. It was the Stalinists who proclaimed Russian communism as real communism. Ernst Lubitsch and Greta Garbo are communists, not Stalinists. They know that communism is humanist in its heart.This is the most pro-communist and one of the most honest and subversive films made in Hollywood in the 1930's, with perhaps Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times" ranking second.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Odd Little Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A stern Russian woman (Greta Garbo) sent to Paris on official business finds herself attracted to a man (Melvyn Douglas) who represents everything she is supposed to detest.The way Soviet Russia is portrayed here is quite strange. We have Ninotchka saying an old man looks "sad" and should not be working, she has a strict adherence to custom and regulation. And censorship completely blocks out the letters of friends. While I do not think this is completely off-base, surely this is exaggerated. (Of course, in some ways, the situation was probably far worse.) I love that this has a Billy Wilder script. Wilder learned a lot from director Lubitsch and went on to direct some of the greatest films out there (I would argue that Wilder surpassed Lubitsch in greatness).We also get a great appearance (although all too small) of the legendary Bela Lugosi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a beautiful and fun romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this film and would recommend it with only one reservation--the silly performance by Garbo for the first 15 minutes she's in the film. Perhaps it was due to her over-acting or perhaps it was due to the way the part was written or directed, but regardless her version of a Russian Commisar was more a silly stereotypical caricature than a real performance. And what a shame it was, because once her character magically transformed into a "real woman", her performance was indeed magical. Watching her smile and laugh was great--and not what you'd expect from this big screen diva. Along the way, the film is very ably supported by wonderful character actors (such as Sig Rumund and Felix Bressart). Melvin Douglas is really engaging in the film provided you ignore that he has no French accent whatsoever--yet he plays a French nobleman. Well, regardless of these quibbles, the real star is the light and engaging direction and cute script (apart from Garbo's first 15 minutes). So I strongly recommend you watch the film and forgive the film's mistakes---it's a ride you will enjoy nevertheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given Lubitsch, Garbo, and all the hype, I expected a lot more of this film. And actually, the first act was brilliant. And then there was that restaurant scene. Garbo was portrayed as a woman who killed for her beliefs, but as soon as Melvyn Douglas tells a couple of lame jokes and falls off a chair--poof, Garbo's a capitalist. She's wearing silly hats, and being another typical silly moony Hollywood female. I didn't buy it.The movie goes slack in the second act. There's no story, really, no dramatic or comic punch, it's just scenes of Garbo in love. And though it's not bad, it's nothing particularly special, which I suppose is what I was expecting. Things do pick up a bit in the third act, but not enough to recover from the long slow middle. Worth watching, and has some individual moments that are classic--usually involving the characters Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski--but overall, a let down, and not the best of either Lubitsch or Garbo.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, but disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I began this week with Ernst Lubitsch's Trouble in Paradise, which is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. I'm also in love with Greta Garbo. Her Queen Christina is one of my favorite films. I had great expectations for Ninotchka. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to those expectations. The film begins well enough. Three Russian ambassadors get distracted from their duty by capitalist excesses in Paris, which leads their superior to send a woman, Ninotchka, to check up on them and report their activities. Ninotchka is a former soldier and is now a cold-hearted communist. She cares about nothing but facts and figures. Almost immediately, she meets up with a Parisian lawyer who just happens to be fighting her and the ambassadors in court over the ownership of some expensive jewelry. The lawyer eventually breaks through her communist armor, challenging her ideals. For nearly an hour, the film is very good. Garbo is hilarious as an almost robotic woman. After she begins to enjoy herself in Paris, the film quickly goes downhill. The film never gets bad, per se, but it's painful to watch a film that had been so humorous only moments ago become so flat. And the film is never romantic, which seems to be what Lubitsch wants. Trouble in Paradise was a hundred times more romantic. Leon, the Parisian lawyer, is kind of a jerk. At least Garbo didn't become submissive to him. That would have hurt me beyond words. She retains her grandeur throughout the film. I say, check this one out. It is too famous to ignore, and, like I said, it never becomes less than watchable. If your thoughts of it are similar to my own, please, check out Trouble in Paradise and Queen Christina. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nowadays, this seems a little dated, what with the anti-Soviet stuff. But if you can look around that, the movie's quite enjoyable. Nina Ivanovna "Ninotchka" Yakushova (Greta Garbo) goes to Paris to find three of her comrades there. While in France's capital, Ninotchka gets to know Count Leon d'Algout (Melvyn Douglas). The only problem is that he represents the bourgeoisie, which is anathema to her proletarian philosophy and lifestyle. Oh, well. She'll probably find a way around that.I guess that by watching "Ninotchka", I now know what the "Lubitsch touch" means. It's also weird to think that this was less than a decade before the Cold War began, and they were already hinting at a possible conflict.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slightly disappointing, given the promise of the cast and writer/director combination, this one turns out to be an only slightly better than average comic take on the American abroad falls for exotic foreigner genre. In this particular variation, Douglas is the American, and Garbo is a comically dour Soviet (her forced demeanor grows stale for me before her character gives it up). Some moments of nice humor, pleasant romance. I thought Cole Porter's musical version ("Silk Stockings", also filmed by MGM) was more entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hilarious Picture In Spite of Its Propagandizing Second Act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ninotchka begins with three Russians, who need not do more than appear on screen to be funny, in Paris to sell jewelry seized from the aristocracy during the Russian Revolution. They meet Melvyn Douglas, who plays himself as always, and nonetheless is quite good at it, on a mission from the Russian Grand Duchess who wants to recover her jewels before they are sold. He charms them and winds up talking them into staying in Paris. The Soviet Union then sends Yakushova, the Greta Garbo character, a special envoy whose objective is to proceed with the sale and retrieve the three bumbling men. Garbo inhabits her character like no other could, and it is a complete mystery how. Her countenance is so cool, earthy, foreign, penetrating. The script creates fine moments of humor out of her being inflexible and thoroughly businesslike at first, but it is Garbo who makes it more than funny. She makes you exceedingly conscious of just how farcically pragmatic and robotic she is. And we are just as stunned as she is when she gradually becomes seduced by Melvyn Douglas and the freedom of the West, and falls in love with both. The three Russian stooges also become happily accustomed to capitalism.And then that is where Ninotchka begins to lose a bit of steam. There are hilarious early scenes, such as the classic bit where Douglas tries relentlessly in the French restaurant to make Garbo laugh (as she famously does) or even crack a smile. The beginning, when Douglas is corrupting the three Russian guys, is directed with a novel approach, one that adds to its tongue-in-cheekness, by Lubitsch, depicting most of it through the reactions of the maids and cigarette girls who enter and exit the hotel suite and the reactive sounds of the Russian men within the room. But during the second act, the movie takes a less than graceful turn for the more dramatic for the sake of being very loudly pro-capitalist, anti- communist propaganda.I don't say that it loses its impact in this manner because of any personal feelings about its agenda. Actually, its saving grace comes at the very end with an unexpected joke that satirizes capitalism. Rather it is the fact that it becomes almost entirely about its agenda instead of following through with the promising spirit of its first half. In spite of this, Ninotchka is a decent entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Becomes Unwatchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here Garbo plays a Soviet official sent to Paris to oversee three Marx Brother type Soviet loons who have bungled their attempts to sell a priceless bit of jewellery which, it turns out, belonged to an exiled Russian royal now in Paris, who wants them back.Garbo speaks Russian in a dour, atonal voice tapering down at the end, like Lotte Lenya's Klebb in From Russia With Love. She has the hooded eyelids and joyless expression of Macca's Linda when made to shake the tambourine to Mul of Kyntyre in Wings.All the Parisians are American actors. The one who woos Garbo's inscrutable Red is Melvyn Douglas, unrecognisable from his later role as Paul Newman's father in Hud.Sadly Douglas sank the film for me. It starts off very well, it's Top Hat territory really: mistaken identity, a suspicious hotel concierge, art deco apartments: all shiny surfaces and those big pannelled doors that slide open and shut. But Douglas is too sexless to be a leading man; you need a roguish charmer like Fred Astaire and once I realised how perfect he would have been in the role, I grew to loathe Douglas who put me in mind of the actor who played Watson opposite Rathbone in the Sherlock Holmes films, or even the headmaster in Ferris Bueller -certainly not leading man material. You want the woman to submit in a battle of sexes comedy because she'll be on to a winner, but here I found myself hoping she'd hold out against him. Why not ask Maurice Chevalier to do the role? I guess they needed an American lead.Also, the credit crunch and the UK's current drift to bankruptcy makes this not such an amusing watch: when Garbo's dour Russian shakes her head and says: "Any culture that allows women to wear such a silly hat cannot be long for this world!", or words to that effect, it's an uncomfortable moment. Because it really is a silly hat... Later, Garbo is seen wearing it once she 'sees the light' regarding Western capitalist ways. It's like having an Iranian woman deciding that Heat magazine is actually a jolly good read on her visit to the UK...When Douglas is off screen, I enjoy the film, but otherwise I had to skip to the end. He talks to Garbo like he's a father indulging a daughter, really quite irritating. Garbo is very good, though her thawing is a bit quick when it happens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and amusing period piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Ninotchka is more interesting for it's depiction of Communism, Russian stereotypes and Cold War American attitudes than the storyline itself. When it was released in 1939, US and Russian relationships were at a high point, so the popular conception was that the movie's message was simply that the Russian people were just like us and that anyone would be Capitalist if they could only be exposed to it. With the signing of the Soviet/Nazi non aggression pact, the film suddenly became a damning indictment of the Communist regime, but when the US and Russia became allies during the Second World War, it suddenly transformed into a cheerful reminder of the humanism of the Eastern bloc.As a result, it is most likely to appeal to Cold War historians and fans of Greta Garbo rather than cinephiles at large. Watching it nowadays though, it shows a cheerfully naive solution to the escalating, alien threat of Communism: love and laughter. Ninotchka, a stern Russian authoritarian on a mission to Paris remains highly critical of what she sees as bourgeois Capitalism until she develops a growing relationship with a middle-aged playboy. At first, their passion is for her, simply a perfunctory obligation, but when he manages to break her steely features with uproarious laughter in the pivotal scene at a working men's restaurant, her demeanour changes.Suddenly, Greta Garbo's robotic woman becomes open to the possibilities of romance. Her emotional reactions to their affair grow ever more passionate and she winds up yearning to be beautiful like the Parisian courtesans. She noticeably starts wearing more make up and upon returning to Moscow, finds the city to be drab and lifeless. In these later scenes, the reasons for the movie being banned in Soviet Russia couldn't be more obvious, for Communism is a suffocating pall that hangs over its citizens lives and where freedom is but a mask that hides a dictatorial, oppressive Government.Certainly, in terms of academic writing there's plenty for the historians to chew on, but in layman's terms the film is really, a bit flat. Garbo of course is an undeniable star and she gives Ninotchka's transformation a sense of realism that is lacking in the script. Melvyn Douglas on the other hand may be charming, but is ultimately nothing more than another romantic male lead from the 1930's, willing to declare his undying love for a woman he has only known for a few days. Given the nature of the storyline, their relationship occupies most of the running time but is too straightforward in its approach to be satisfying. It is simply another pattern of meeting, falling in love despite the initial strain, coming into a difficulty, overcoming it, coming into a greater difficulty and then when all seems lost, reuniting at the finale for plenty of those clichéd classical Hollywood kisses where they rub cheeks together after a passionate meeting of the lips.However, the movie has another selling point beyond Greta Garbo and that comes in the shape of the trio of Russian delegates Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski. Their storyline introduces us to the movie overall as they are sent to Paris ahead of Ninotchka, but instead of being serious Communists, they come across more as three cheeky young men, playfully enjoying the hitherto unexplored delights of Royal Hotel Suites and French Maids in revealing outfits. They provide some of the biggest laughs of the film, even when they are not on screen and it's a pity they don't get more exposure as they are far more endearing than the romantic plot.In short then, an interesting period piece but not one that stands the test of time. A lot of the humour has grown stale and while Garbo fans will lap it up, its most interesting selling point for today's audiences is in providing an example of how Hollywood handled the early years of the Cold War.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated, Overrated, Too Many Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard much about this movie but I only saw it recently on VHS. Its premise, a Soviet comrade who falls for a dilettante in pre-War Paris, has potential. But the 1930s requirement for evening dress scenes, a bedroom scene or two, always with lavish studio sets, suddenly makes the plotline seem foolish. When the third act moves to a communal apartment in Moscow, the movie becomes ludicrous.Garbo is both sultry and radiant and when the camera moves in for a closeup, she glows under the special lens. And true, you get to see Garbo laugh. But since I never bought into the love affair between Garbo and Douglas, I found the remainder of the film concocted. The ending is atrocious and unsatisfying.There is no one to blame for this. This is a period movie that hasn't survived the period. Ironically, there is a good Russian film 'Sluzhebnyj roman' which deals with similar characters: a strait-laced, hard, professional woman who meets a man and opens up to love. No doubt the theme is universal. It's just that "Ninotchka" misses the execution, at least to modern eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I should say that I'm not a closet fan of Soviet Russia.However, seeing Soviet Russia spoofed so clumsily in this film is just plain embarrassing. The whole notion of making a featherweight comedy set in one of the most oppressive societies of all time is somewhat questionable, and it becomes completely absurd when the "oppression" we see centers mainly around the rationing of eggs and Western lingerie. In other words, this movie feels so artificial, and so tame, and so Hollywood, that its attempts to depict the hardships of life under Communism are laughable.Too bad the intended jokes aren't as funny. Most of the humor here is of a twee and dated nature - like Garbo's "amusing" pudgy friend in Russia, and our hero punching an obnoxious clerk. Good grief.An 8.0 on IMDb? Surpassing the French Connection, and nipping at the heels of Floating Weeds? I don't believe it. Some classics really are great, but some are pure cheese.
