		<shortDescription>80's Entertainment At Its Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love those cheesy 80's teenage love stories. They are fun and entertaining. "Can't Buy Me Love" is one of the better ones for sure. It is one of those movies that you can watch over and over and still love it. The story is interesting and the performances are great. Amanda Peterson is fantastic as the high-priced yet emotionally repressed love interest of lawnboy Patrick Dempsey. The story is funny and moving and can even make you cry. Watch it with friends, watch it alone, watch it with someone you love and remember the pressures of high school and the friends that got you through it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated and charming 80's teen flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most 80's teen flicks leave a rather sick feeling in my stomach, but this one has always been a favorite despite the stereotypical shallow, big-haired girls and the Animal House wanna-be jocks. The difference is that the stars, Patrick Dempsey and Amanda Peterson, are not so stereotypical in their roles as lonely nerd and ultra-popular head cheerleader.Patrick Dempsey has always been underrated as an actor with style, and it is unfortunate that his character, Ronald, is so unlikable after the film's premise kicks in. Ronald goes "from geek to chic" and back again. But Dempsey himself seems too inherently confident to really pull off the geek aspect believably, and he's too cruel to the girl whose heart he won for Ronald to be a truly sympathetic character. The hip version of Ronald, however, is a hoot to watch, even if it is somewhat overdone in the context of an already unlikely plot. The standout in this film is Amanda Peterson, whose character Cindy has to be one of the most genuinely likeable "stuck up" high school girls on film. Watching her character grow and open her heart to Ronald is the main reason I've given this film repeated viewings. Although the genres are quite different, I'd compare Peterson's character to Renee Zellweger's character in Jerry MaGuire in terms of sheer likability. Making characters likeable is much more difficult than making them sympathetic, and I'm frankly shocked that Peterson's career did not skyrocket after this performance.Whether you're looking for creative ways to invest $1000 or dancing lessons, Can't Buy Me Love is one 80's teen flick that has a lot to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The High School Caste System</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can't Buy Me Love is a sweet romantic comedy that's still great after all these years. What was the reason for making an exact replica of the film (Love Don't Cost A Thing) except geared for young black audiences? Why not just make an original romantic comedy altogether instead of trying to replicate this particular teen movie? I hate remakes. Can't Buy Me Love ridicules the high school caste system--that popular kids are the invincible social class that other social groups strive to be part of, but are limited by the "understood" rigid rules of their place among the social system. Ronald (Patrick Dempsey) is supposed to be the hopeless nerd. He's a quiet kid that flocks with loners (one of them being the cool Max Perlich). Ronald is in love with senior cheerleader, Cindy Mancini (Amanda Peterson). As the popular, rich cheerleader, she is definitely hands off for Ronald. Ronald wants the girl. He wants to be popular. Is it possible for the geek to transcend his expected role in the game of high school social groups? Definitely, but for Ronald, the consequences are disasturous and also conducive to helping Ronald straighten out his priorities of friendship, love, and the like. Is he willing to trade it all in for popularity and all the superficiality that comes with it?Ronald's opportunity arrives when Cindy stumbles into the mall one day looking to return or exchange her mother's outfit stained with wine thanks to Cindy, who wasn't supposed to be wearing it, anways. The price of a new outfit: $1,000. So, Ronald, who happens to have that cash since he was saving up for a telescope, makes Cindy an offer: to pretend to be his girlfriend for a month. Ronald expects that this will give him just the popularity he wants. To be a high school senior, friends with Cindy, and make the A List? For Ronald, that's all he wants. Cindy's grossed out by the idea at first, not wanting to be scene with Donald (as she constantly mistakens his name). But with the Mancini make over, Ronald's on his way to being the new stud on campus. One month later, Ronald is rubbing elbows with Cindy's senior friends, cheerleaders Barbara and Patti and and jocks Big John and Ricky. But, Ronald, in his transition, seemed to forgot that what he wanted all along was a date with Cindy Mancini, who's makeover has turned Ronald into some kind of monster. Ronald doesn't only push Cindy away, but also his closest friend, Kenneth (Courtney Gains) and the rest of his old crowd of friends who hate their friend's newfound social life. But, how far is Ronald willing to go? And how long can he live down the lie?It was one of three good movies Dempsey made in 1987, along with Loverboy and In the Mood (actually the latter is better than the former), all being cute romantic comedies. But I think Can't Buy Me Love will always be my favorite. Patrick Dempsey, Amanda Peterson, Seth Green (who plays Ronald's little brother, Chuckie), or hell, even Max Perlich fans, are certain to like this movie. It's got good style for the 80s too and hot teen cast. I still think it is one of the top 80s teen comedies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The person that said this movie was overlong but enjoyable doesn't know what they are talking about. If you want to see overlong, watch Dances With Wolves and it wasn't even enjoyable. "Can't Buy Me Love" is the ultimate 80's movie along with "Breakfast Club" and "Adventures in Babysitting". I watch this movie each time it's on TV. I also have it on VHS and DVD. The story line was easy to follow, not that matters and just kept you interested. I enjoyed all the characters and could definitely see my high school years in them. If you haven't seen this movie, rent, get it, watch it. If you have seen this movie then you know what I'm talking about.I'm Nikki and I approve this message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best 80s movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like 80s movies this is my top 5 of all time. This movie is amazing and should not be forgotten. The story is about Ronald played by Patrick Dempsey who is a nerd and lives next door to Cindy the most popular girl in High School played by Amanda Peterson. Ronald mows lawns for a living and is saving his money for his science project. He finally has enough money to pay for his project but he decides to help out Cindy with dilemma. Cindy ruins her moms dress at a party and she needs a 1,000 dollars to buy a new dress so her mom doesn't ground her for life. Ronald decides to give up his money for the project if Cindy pretends to like him. The movie is amazing. Its very funny, great acting, and the chemistry works. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I could watch it over and over again. If you like 80s movies check this movie out as well as Teen Witch, Some Kind Of Wonderful, Just One of the guys, and Big.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes the most important thing eludes us and we don't recognize it. Not everyone has the opportunity to recognize, especially when one lives it, what is really important, what is in fact real; the truth of who we are and who others are. And to recognize that before the others and ourselves. Not everyone has that opportunity. Almost all of us fall in the lies and fictions of who we are, who the others are and the place of all of us in our world, but only few of us - lucky few - manage, in the end, but maybe still in time, to see the truth, the reality. And these ones, may consider themselves very happy.All it takes is to understand that, and we can be who we want to: our own selves.If you like '80s teen comedies, this one is not to be missed. I liked this movie and i just wanted to share these thoughts i had after seeing it. Patrick Dempsey is good in it, and Amanda Peterson is absolutely great, loved her. Wish i had met a girl like her when i was in high school. But then again, maybe i did...7/10 overall, a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good and is much better then one might expect it to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It kind of reminded me of revenge of the nerds. I liked this cute little movie about a geeky boy who pays the hottest highschool cheerleader at his school to pose as his girlfriend. This is a fun movie and one that works surprisingly well. One of the better teen comedies from the 80's. Myabe not as popular as some others but just as good and somehow does not come across as ridiculous as so many similar movies of this time period did. It's a definite must see for anyone who appreciates a movie like "Revenge of the nerds" and hasn't got to see this yet. I really enjoyed it. Obviously the movie's not an Oscar winner or to highly original but it works and as teen movies go, it is toward the top of the heap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great 80's teen movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best "wannabe popular" teen movie I've seen. Yes it's old, only a year after I was born, but it's still way cool to see the awful trends of the 80's :) It's about the typical "geek" wanting to be the "popluar" kid, who takes extreme measures to achieve his goal. It's not anything anyone hasn't seen before. Geek wants the girl, geek gets popular, geek drops his true friends, becomes a geek again, although the ending is really good! It's just so much fun to watch an 80's teen movie, there so great! It's also fun to see stars in earlier films. Who doesn't want to see Seth Green as a bratty younger brother? Good movie, watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good flyweight entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen bundles of these teen comedies, and "Can't Buy Me Love" does contain every cliche in the book. But it was made in 1987. This was a little past the dawning of the high school movie, and the characters of the nerd, jock, cheerleader, etc. were just recently created. I don't know. Maybe this movie was even a huge cliche back in the eighties. But I'm still gonna give it the benefit of the doubt. I catch this movie on TBS quite a lot of times, and I can't help but enjoy it. There are certain cliched scenes that just force me to roll my eyes and sigh, yet I can't change the channel. Well, there are two key elements that make this flyweight teen comedy work: Patrick Dempsey and Amanda Peterson. They both give charming performances, and have a wonderful chemistry. Even though you know exactly what will happen between them, it's still a delight to see them on screen. Dempsey hasn't had a big role in years, and you can technically classify him as a has-been, but he is a good, charismatic actor. And it would've been nice if his career actually took off. As for Peterson, I don't remember her from any other movies, so I have no knowledge of her career. All I know is she's good-looking and I liked her in this movie. The story is as predictable as you can get, with paperthin characters, but as I said it's good flyweight entertainment. Strictly a guilty pleasure. If I were in the mood for a good--and by that I mean good in quality--high school movie I'd watch "Ghost World" or one of the "American Pie" movies. But if I just want to kick back and watch a cheesy high school movie that will put a smile on my face and contains no intellectual value, I'll watch "Can't Buy Me Love." Of course, the movie has a "message" at the end about being yourself, and not caring what others think of you, but the message is delivered with the finesse of an after-school special and is strictly pasted on. When you have characters that are so stereotypical and implausible, it's hard to fit in a believable message. But what would a high school movie be without a schmaltzy third act? That's why I recommend this movie, just as a guilty pleasure. It's far from great, yet undeniably appealing. But please do not bother to analyze this movie. You'll be wasting your time. My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A high school boy saves up 2000 dollars for a new telescope, but winds up spending it for a girlfriend. She was the most popular girl at school, and needed the money to replace her mother's jacket that she [the girl] had ruined. In return, the girl must date the boy for a month, making him suddenly popular, something he isn't used to at all. Of course, he is found out eventually, and all his new "friends" turn against him. A picture which is well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Teen Flick of the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Possible SpoilersThere I said it. I love this movie. It is cute, heart warming, and also very honest and revealing. I can tell you why this movie was not a hit when it came out but really is a cult favorite now. This movie exposed the 'popular' myth, it showed just how fragile and shallow the 'popular' thing is and how many are simply followers. Of course popular kids at the time would not warm to this movie, it showed them to be either manipulators or followers neither of which anyone wanted to admit to.People mention how this movie does not compare to John Hughes films, and you are right. Because in his flicks the popular kids come out looking good at the end. Hughes films are better written and overall acted but they are not as honest or real as this movie.I am sick of people complaining about stereotypes. Why/How does a stereotype exist?!?! Because there are many, many people who ARE the stereotype. Stereotypes are not created from nothing, they are the single expression of large whole. Complain about stereotypes when they are inaccurate. The stereotypes in this movie are spot on.I know personally that a big reason I love this movie is because I was on both sides of the fence. I was in the popular crowd when I was young, from 1st - 7th grades. Then we moved. For a year I was kinda a nerd/loner, I just hung around the perimeter. I was friends with most of the 'popular' girls but disliked almost all the 'popular' guys so eventually did my own thing. I was liked by most groups at the school but was not part of the 'popular' group.. by choice. But I also did one of the meanest things I have ever done in my life. I basically stole another guys friend and then told him to beat it because he was not 'cool' enough. I am still ashamed of that. I was basically a kid trying to be cool that really was a nerd inside. Moved again for my last 2 years of HS. This really was a bizarre experience as the 'popular' group was small and not well defined. I think this was due to so many new students moving into the area and I guess disrupting things. My best friend was a nerd, but a very very smart one, and a year younger. Again I did my own thing and liked who I wanted to like. It was also at this HS that I witnessed something very similar to the movie.This was in the grade below me. A 'popular' pretty girl dumped a jock and began dating a guy from the 'bad' crowd, you know the group that wore metal concert t-shirts and smoked. Wow, it was amazing to see the effects this had on the school and in particular that class, it turned the whole 'popular' thing on it's head.One other reason this movie works is that the chemistry between Patrick Dempsey and Amanda Peterson is obvious. They just have it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think if you listen to the lyrics of Neil Young's 'Keep on rockin' in the free world' it's kind of like a make-shift anthem for high school people. In a way, not all will agree with Neil or the song, but this movie had me in stitches (at times) given that I didn't laugh as much as "Fast Times At Ridgemeont High", this was a more heart felt story of a young nerd/geek (Dempsey)who is definitely coming into his own. Not all geeks stay geeks. Not all nerds stay nerds either. Patrick Dempsey successfully plays the guy you root for! And on top of it all are Cindy's gorgeous girlfriends that he is now a part of ...their world.Look back at your high school days and see who really changed. It's quite amazing sometimes. In this fun flick made in good Ole Tucson Arizona, the cast of nuts and crazies was like the stock market, with that 'Popularity' thing, up, up, up, then down and out. Patrick Dempsey was so right in this 'Ronny' character, I still laugh. I kind of remember a Cindy Mancini type in high school, which I'm sure many do. That super-hot chic, guys were lining up for. Back in 1998, I was working at a resort in Phoenix and got to meet and put Amanda Petersen (Cindy Mancini) into a town-car for the airport. She was very nice and looked great in person. She signed my little ticket, and called me 'Babe', I was charmed by her she was very wonderful to meet even briefly. She kissed me on the cheek, before getting into the Towncar...it was one of those moments in life. I probably looked like Charlie Brown after being kissed by the little red-headed girl at that point as the car was pulling away.I recommend this for all the high school crazy antics we all did and or miss, from that era in our lives.

		<shortDescription>From total geek to totally chic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Patrick Dempsey caught my eye in this adorable little movie about a boy who falls in love with the girl next door and sets out to win both her and popularity.Possible spoilers: As Ronald Miller (or as the object of his affection calls him Donald), Dempsey is transformed before our eyes from an offbeat, lovable geek to a smokin' hot studmuffin whom all the girls lust after. Despite the fact that his character becomes a total jerk, he is just so darn cute it's hard not to dislike him. After she ruins one of her mother's favorite outfits, Cindy Mancini (played by the perky and beautiful Amanda Peterson)finds herself in need of Ronald's help. Even though he lives right next door to her, she doesn't know he is alive. She lets him help her, and in exchange, she agrees to pretend they are boyfriend and girlfriend. This arrangement leads to a series of events in which they both learn important lessons about relationships and themselves.It is so much more than the average teenage comedy, and you can see glimpses of the future Dr. McDreamy in Dempsey. Great movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This late 80's teeny bopper, starring the king of the teeny boppers, Patrick Dempsey, is a MASTERPIECE. As an eight year old in Wisconsin, I obtained a copy of "Can't Buy Me Love" from one of my favorite babysitters. For the next month I must have watched the film at least 20 times. 16 years went by until the glorious day when "Can't Buy Me Love" was finally released on DVD. As quickly as I could, I purchased the DVD, had it sent overnight priority, and then spent the next 2 weeks in a state of rapture and ecstasy. Anyone out there who can appreciate a good teeny bopper absolutely has to see this film. It is loaded with one liners that you will remember, the performances, plot, and dialogue are all horrifically entertaining, and Patrick Dempsey is hilarious. The other notable performance comes from Seth Green, when he says, "Something stinks in suburbia." I won't ruin any other moments of this film, but I strongly, strongly recommend it to anyone with a good sense of humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess in the case of this movie you could say "you might get what you paid for". The messages in this movie are pretty clear. They are made easy to identify by many simple one dimensional supporting characters and a few scenes devoted to clearly spelling a message out. This movie is extremely stereotypical, but it was made in and about a very stereotypical time, so I don't think they went too far in portraying these characters as their stereotypes and little else. The messages and characters will seem very familiar to those of us who grew up and went to high school in the 80's, but may be be lost on teenagers today. All of that said this is basically a pretty good movie, that I can never turn off when I happen to catch it on cable. The performances are very good by the main characters and reasonably good by some of the supporting characters and the scenes move well without any wasted time. There is very little build up to any of the movies scenes, so there is really something going on all the time. Not in the same class as The Breakfast Club or Sixteen Candles, but very watchable and enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whaaaaat?! No nudity? No graphic sex scenes? Limited profanity? And great acting? Doesn't sound like a good teen flick by today's standards...but "Love" is. The relationship "pops" between main characters Ronald and Cindy. Cindy--a beautiful, yet mature young woman--popular, but with genuine character and a desire for true love. Ronald--a likewise intelligent teen, naive that he has won the heart of his dream girl, who gets blinded by fame. The relationship--actually, the movie--provides some valuable lessons on friendship and the costs of gaining our wildest dreams.Along with "The Breakfast Club," "Say Anything," and "The Sure Thing," this is one of the best teen films of the 80's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can't Buy Me Love. Yes,a hit song for the Beatles,but to me its one of the finest films of all time. Why,you ask? Because Can't Buy Me Love is one of those movies that comes along ever so rarely and leaves the viewer realizing that this is the way things are(Not getting a girl for $1000,but the way "popularity" is).The cast is excellent right from Patrick Dempsey as the lead to Seth Green(*yes from Austin Powers*).The clothes,the music may be all 80's but so what? The focus of a nerd trying to be one of the cool,accepted people in society is something everyone can relate to,whether you were cool in high school or wanted to be. The consequences of "trying to buy your way in" can be devastating. This film is filled with several one-liners and situational comedy(*you'll love the African anteater ritual dance*).No matter how often you watch this film,it has the ability to make you think,to make you agree,and of course make you laugh. Its a shame this movie is no longer in print.If you are fortunate to live close to a video store that owns it,please go rent it.Even if you're "washing your hair,or out of the country"</fullReview>

The boy next door who thinks his neighbor is the girl of his dreams....it's happened to all of us. It's a timeless story of thinking you know what you want because of how it appears on the outside looking in. This is the fun story you get to watch unfold as an outsider buys his way in. You will root for him along the way. You'll fall in love with the characters on both sides as this movie shows you that not everything you think is reality and you won't ever really know what it's like in someone else's world until you walk in their shoes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ronald Miller pines for Cindy the most popular girl in school who doesn't know he's alive. That all changes when she borrows her mom's blouse and accidentally ruins it at a house party now she must replace it before she finds out. Ronald offers to buy her a new one in exchange for becoming his girlfriend for a month.Ronald gains new found popularity among the jocks and cheerleaders who thinks he's a stud. He ditches his old friends for the highlight.The movie not only explores themes like popularity and love in simple terms like other teen flicks. Popularity is shown like a class system. The top percent get the nice tables, women and parties. The bottom are picked on, forced to sit at certain locations and can't even communicate with someone out of their league. Bullying is a took to install fear and keep the herd in line.Cindy and Ronald are kinda like other famous tragic couples. They are forced apart by their peers and expect to act a certain way if they want to keep their status. It's almost like a fairy tale and they end happily ever after when they realize it's all nonsense.Unlike Romeo and Juliet these two get to ride off in the sunset and plan on attending prom. A match made in heaven. Ronald even ends up winning over his old friends and respect of his peers.Bring out the hankie. You won't be able to keep your eyes dry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if I've ever seen anything like it! Every line of dialogue, every character, the setting, the music, the plot, the ending - everything is cliché. It's just a formula. Here's a list: high school setting, nerd/cool transformation, football player guy/cheerleader girl combination, nerd friends/jock friends, reversal of popularity/coolness by someone who formerly had popularity/coolness, the sentimental seriousness near the end of the movie with the soft rock 80s music playing in the background, and ... and this is the best of the whole lot ... the slow clap at the end of the movie cheering him on.No kidding!! A slow clap develops and develops and then everyone's cheering and everything's great! But it's serious!!! I'm not sure if this is a 1 or a 10 or somewhere in between. It's baffling! Someone could have written this whole script in half a day, the plot is so cliché and formulaic that, when you add the cliché characters in the mix, and the cliché setting, the script virtually writes itself. Think about it. You're a writer in Hollywood in the 80s and you throw the plot, setting, and characters together in your mind and you would just naturally start writing because it's so easy, it's so so easy, the whole script is already written for you, you just have to fill it in. This is a paint by numbers movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A nerdy outcast (Patrick Dempsey) secretly pays the most popular girl in school (Amanda Peterson) one thousand dollars to be his girlfriend.At the time this film was made, I do not think anyone involved was terribly well-known. Seth Green was obviously too young to get noticed. Patrick Dempsey had more than ten years to go. And Courtney Gains, though a popular guy in horror circles, has never really made it big. Amanda Peterson is a mystery... she seems to have just stopped.The plot is fun and a bit predictable, but the predictable parts are what make it fun. Is this really how popularity works? I do not think so, but what do I know? I never understood it in high school and now twenty years later I still have not figured it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ladies, you will love Patrick Dempsey transforming from a nerd to a very naughty bad boy. That was my only favorite scene, it's like he is showing off his true colors! I thought the rest was alright but there weren't that great enough scene's.I think there was a lot of whining going on too that would definitely put you off regarding girls grouping over Ronald and the fact, Cindy had kept pressuring him on pointless things like breaking up in public which was fake. I say they copied Grease or any other Greaser films just so Patrick Dempsey looked good in this which he did but Rom Com is definitely not for him to act in!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was inspired to watch this otherwise forgotten 80s teen rom-com by the recent tragic death of star Amanda Peterson.It certainly doesn't hold a candle to the better known teen comedies from the genre's golden age, but stars Patrick Dempsey and Peterson are quite good, and the film features an early appearance from Seth Green, who steals every scene he's in as Dempsey's little brother. Also featured are Ricardo (Rico Ssssuave!), Courtney "Malachai" Gaines and several other familiarish faces.There's just enough here to merit a revisit if you're an 80s kid. For all others, your mileage may vary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Better 80's Teen Comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cindy Mancini" (Amanda Peterson) is the head of the cheerleading squad and the most popular person in high school. "Ronald Miller" (Patrick Dempsey) is the head nerd and essentially avoided by everyone except his fellow geeks. One day in the local shopping mall he happens to observe Cindy in some emotional distress and goes over to see what is wrong. He then learns that one of the jocks at the school accidentally spilled red wine on a very valuable suede jacket she took from her mother's closet and she desperately needs $1000 dollars to replace it. Since she needs the money and he wants to feel what it's like to be popular in school he offers her the money he has saved mowing lawns in exchange for her being his girlfriend in public for a month. Unfortunately for them, neither of them realize the ramifications. Now, as far as this movie is concerned I will just say that that this is one of the better 80's teen comedies produced with both Amanda Peterson and Patrick Dempsey performing in an exceptional manner. One particular scene involving the "African Anteater Dance" was especially hilarious. In any case, I highly recommend this movie for those interested in a film of this type and rate it as above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>teen movie switch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ronald Miller (Patrick Dempsey) is a nerdy kid. Cindy Mancini (Amanda Peterson) is the school queen bee cheerleader. Her mother would like her to go out with nice boys like the Miller lawnboy instead of her narcissistic football player boyfriend Bobby. Bobby is now in college and has left Cindy behind. She ruins her mom's jacket and needs to replace it. Ronald is tired of playing cards with his dorky friends. He sees a distraught Cindy at the mall. Instead of buying a telescope, he comes up with a scheme to become popular by pretending to date for one month. His little brother Chuckie (Seth Green) is suspicious.This one does a switch with the normal teen movie cliché and gives the guy an exterior makeover. I didn't see the appeal of Dempsey or his character back in the day. I guess many others saw the McDreamy hidden underneath. It still baffles me a little but at least he's a neurosurgeon on the TV show. The formula works to a limited extend. Amanda Peterson does well to transition from shallow queen bee into a deeper pool. She's a great 'Where are they now?' actress. It's also fun to see a young Seth Green. The climatic lunch encounter is way too earnest which this movie suffers from time to time. Ronald's (cool?) outfit is ridiculously hilarious. It could all work if I actually like Dempsey and his character.</fullReview>

It is a hilarious movie and teaches important lessons about popularity and high school life. Amanda Peterson plays as Cindy, the most popular girl at school. While, Patrick Dempsey is Ronald, a nerd who wants to fit in with the cool kids. I think that this is one of the best 80's teen comedies. I've seen it ten times and I'm still not tired of it. This movie is different from the other teen comedies of the era because the actors are not stereotypical in their roles.

		<shortDescription>Dempsey Saves The Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Patrick Dempsey was immensely charming back in the day. He still is. But his skinny geek routine was priceless in the 80's and early 90's. He managed to infuse it with style and grace and make you root for him, while avoiding clichés. It takes skill to own an image without copying someone else's version.This one covers the familiar 80's high school social-class-conflict theme but, also touches on an interesting concept. People want something when they see that someone they respect wants it. I've been there. If you're seen with an attractive girl, other girls who never considered you, start taking a second look. Dempsey's character, being one of the smart kids, figures this out.There is some gross out humor that really turned me off. Seth Green is adorable and funny as the annoying little brother. I had no idea he was old enough to have been in movies back then.One thing that cracks me up is that Dempsey frequently appeared as the unofficial Jewish guy in these teen movies, because he is from the East Coast, has dark hair, a prominent nose, and played a geek. But I'm guessing he is Irish.Apparently Amanda Peterson was only 16 when this film came out and perhaps even younger while filming. Usually the actors playing a Senior in high school are in their 20's. In this case, she was younger than a Senior and had never even experienced being a Senior before in real life. She was relatively cute and most effective when she told off some stud who was bothering her at a lunch table. I liked her character because she knew who and what she was, but she was willing to take some chances.Believe me though, that most of the snobbish popular kids in real 80's high schools were shallow and not very nice people.Check it out on youtube.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Standard romantic plot, but good insights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie has a typical romantic plot within an American high-school setting, with lead characters being a nerd (Ronald) and the head cheerleader (Cindy). She and her friends would not even acknowledge him when passing by whereas he is desperately infatuated her. Ronald figures that he needs to become popular in order to be noticed by girls and offers Cindy a thousand dollars to pretend in public that they are going out, hoping that it would boost his popularity. She accepts the offer and throws in his makeover at no extra cost. The rest of the storyline is fairly predictable. However, there are two issues that this movie addresses probably more successfully than most of the other teen chick flicks: leadership and forgiveness.The rest may contain some spoilers.Ronald aspires not only to acceptance by his peers, but also to becoming their informal leader. The path that he initially takes in order to achieve that status is typical of a high-school environment, as he chooses exclusivity over social cohesion, egoism over altruism, herd mentality over individuality and conceit over humility. Eventually, he realises that sustainable informal leadership is based on selfless acts and promoting social inclusion.Whilst at the peak of his ill-gotten popularity, Ronald does not forgive Cindy the fact that she used to ignore him when he was just one of the geeks. In fact, he cruelly rejects her even though she has developed warm feelings for him and has extended him support and trust that are well in excess of what is stipulated in their arrangement. However, once his popularity has vanished and he is left with no friends, he expects Cindy and his former best friend to immediately take him back and forgive all the gross insults he has inflicted upon them. Having failed that, Ronald finally realises that he needs to deserve to be forgiven.</fullReview>

That's become a romantic thing now - wow !Pretty cool movie that's fun to watch even now.Just because the casts are teenagers doesn't mean that the movie is a light weight.It seems like a dumb movie, but it's too good of a romance to be taken lightly.Older actors would have done it differently, but this is just as good as any love story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the elements of a solid movie, and a 10/10 in genre. Must-see. Solid acting, great casting, thoughtful and witty script, very-well pacing, lots of different scene backdrops (not usually mentioned in reviews, but it helps immensely to maintain flow and interest), good music, moral message without being too righteous or hammy, and an overall uplifting feel. Basically, it is like a light-hearted Breakfast Club or Sixteen Candles- only differences are lesser-known actors and fewer serious scenes exchanged for more silly scenes. But by silly, I don't mean stupid or vulgar like today's teen movies. Movies deserve a lot credit when they take an audience from low to high to low and then back up to mid-high. When this is done well, it is a movie that most people can watch over and over, and most of us have or will be watching this film over and over. Also, the fact that there are so many people in the cast, it holds your interest- nerds, jocks, cheerleaders, parents, teachers, and a pain little brother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did you ever want to buy your way into the cool crowd? Yeah, unless you were already in it we all thought about it at one point or another but in the movie I'm reviewing this time, Can't Buy me Love, Ronny Miller played by Patrick Dempsey actually got a chance to. In this movie which I stumbled upon one early Saturday morning while watching HBO as a kid, Ronny Miller saves up one-thousand dollars for a telescope that he earns from mowing lawns. When he goes to buy the telescope he notices Cindy Mancini, played by Amanda Peterson, who of course is the most popular girl in school in need of some help. She tells him that she ruined her mothers dress and that she has no way of replacing it. Ronny decides to buy her a new one in exchange for a date that he hopes will make him popular.I didn't know why I loved this movie as a kid so much. There was no slapstick comedy,no crazy characters or even any action but maybe when I look back that's what I loved about it so much.It just felt real. It felt like typical high school even though I didn't truly know what that was since I was only ten. My favorite part of the movie was that they cast a young Seth Green as the role of Ronnys little brother.For this movie I'll give it four Seth greens out of five only for the fact that every time this movie is on no matter what part it's at I'll have to sit and watch it to the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Patrick Dempsey stars as what is referred to as a dork in the movie but what we would probably refer to as normal today. Truth is in real high school, there are far more dorks and/or normal kids than there are hotties and cool types. However, only a dork would pay $1000 to make a girl pretend to be his girlfriend for a month. Of course the typical complications ensue, but the movie forces us to see the failure of Dempsey's ways over and over. The fact is most girls would be turned off by the desperation that they would gladly shake themselves loose after a month's time. This 80's male fantasy film tries to convince us that the Patrick Dempsey types of the high school world would quickly turn into big-headed jerks, and the cool hottie girl in high school is as nice as pie. The supporting student roles are so stereotyped in the film they border on parodies of themselves. The film is inspirational though in that it demonstrates to those of us dorks who toiled beyond high school scouring the world for female companionship (for no other reason than nobody wanted us) that we should have just been ourselves, and we would have been fine. Yeah I can just see thousands of hottie cheerleader types flocking to thin, gangly guys with no sense of high school fashion because gangly guys are just being themselves. For sure... The irony is Patrick Dempsey is now a hottie among the 40's set courtesy of Grey's Anatomy. ** of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a child of the 80's and I loved this movie. I think Amanda Peterson was a wonderful actress in this, as well as being absolutely beautiful. Her and Patrick Dempsey took a world where there are many cliques of people and helped many people to realize that you can be whom ever you wish to be, do what ever you wish to do, and be friends with people for who they are and not so much because of what they look like, how smart they, or what category they fit into. I used to be the shy quiet type, who sat out at dances, never really approached girls that much, and was definitely part of the in-crowd. I think those who saw this movie either got nothing from it and continued to be self centered jerks that have no idea that they have major issues, or they took a lot from this movie. For me it has great entertainment value, a great lesson for people, and it was influential in my life and helped me to open up to show the world who I am. Now the world either accepts me for who I am, befriends me, or they don't. What I realized was that I didn't have to be what everyone else set up to be the standards, I had to be me. I think many other people figured out that they had to be themselves also and not follow like a bunch of sheep. It also doesn't hurt that Amanda Peterson is/was hot!

		<fullReview>I loved this film, but I admit it's a love it or hate it sort of flick - a high school nerd wants to be cool, so he pays a cheerleader to date him for a while, but he becomes too arrogant and it all comes crashing down around him, and I think you can work out how it goes from here.It's a classic 1980s teen film, perhaps comparable to 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' or the 'Revenge of the Nerds' series of films in its attitude and style, although the story is most similar to the more recent 'She's All That' starring Freddie Prinze Jnr and Rachel Leigh Cook. Having said that it could probably be compared to every teen flick devised in the last twenty years, although this one is more charming in its innocence and kitsch value than most more modern efforts.Expect to be entertained, if not amazed by the quality of the acting or the scriptwriting. Watch this if you're in the mood for some light hearted (and light headed) comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is for pressure-cooked high school kids to relate to and get some laughs out of. I was a teenager just two years ago and I can still remember the pressure to stretch yourself beyond your means to prove you belonged, whether it was on the courts, stages, or classrooms. Unfortunately, the pressure to be somebody in life doesn't really go away and it is the result of a demanding american society. It seems like one of society's great dysfunctional relationships with man is to make him feel inadequate if he lacks status. This movie shows that while achieving status may satisfy the ego's needs, it does not make for a trouble-free world. In other words, you can make it to the top but not hold it forever. Not to mention "Can't buy me love" conveys other morals- be yourself, don't sell out your old friends or burn the bridges that you have crossed, popularity is just a false sense of security, and most importantly, be happy with what you got.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny, decent, enjoyable 80s teen film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of those rare teen films from the 80s that is actually watchable and enjoyable, a rarity in this genre. The plot may be predictable, the characters a bit stereotyped, (not as bad as Breakfast Club however) but the dialogue and characterizations are very good. The film holds the interest throughout. It holds up well for its age and still maintains a positive message. It doesn't take a genius to figure out the ending, but it really doesn't matter, the film is so much fun to watch, you don't care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful 80's fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite films that came out of the glamorized, over the top decade of the 80's. Patrick Dempsey is believable and likeable as the nerd Ronald Miller. Ronald Miller is tired of sitting on the visitors side of the football game, not being able to walk down the "cool" hall and having his social engagements consist of a night of poker and "chips, dips and dorks". Mowing yard after yard he finally saves enough money for his dream telescope when he sees the damsel of his dreams in distress. The darling little valley girl has spilled red wine on her mom's obscenely expensive suede outfit and is desperate. Our loveable geek makes a business deal that his him walking the cool hall the next day. This film shows a lot of the pitfalls of being a teenager and how being popular really isn't all its cracked up to be. The dialogue is often funny and at other times touching. Patrick Dempsey turns his character into a warm, vibrant person who in the end you can forgive for being so shallow. Don't miss the "anteater ritual".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ordinarily I don't like this kind of American high-school movie, but I actually enjoyed this one. It is -- in the end -- really sweet. My only objection: The moral is supposed to be something along the lines of "be yourself and all will turn out well." But if Ronald had stayed himself, Cindy would still have thought him a nerd, and totally ignored him. A minor point, because the movie is sheer entertainment, and it delivers quite a number of chuckles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlong, predictable but enjoyable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even at 92 minutes, "Can't Buy Me Love" is slightly overlong. Its utter predictability makes most of the events in the last third seem inevitable and the film has no surprises in store for us. It's still quite enjoyable, though, and reasonably well-acted by the two leads who manage to make their stereotypical characters believable (the supporting characters remain stereotypical, though). Seth Green, who plays Dempsey's kid brother, has a hilarious, scene-stealing (if minor) role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't see this movie enough! Patrick Dempsey's character goes through what most teenagers face--doing whatever it takes to be popular. And in the process, he loses it identity and alienates his old friends. He is also so blinded by popularity that he doesn't even realize that his main objective in being popular--Cindy--is the one he is hurting the most. I think this movie gives a good message to teenagers that what is more important than popularity is to "be yourself."</fullReview>

While old guys like myself can only regret the missed opportunities peer pressure has cost us, maybe the younger folks can learn from it. Meaningful without being preachy, this movie should be mandatory viewing once a year in high schools.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ronald Miller is just your average nerd who decides he wants to be popular. He rents Cindy for a month and this does make him popular but it falls apart near the end of the movie. Not hard to predict that it would fall apart. It has good story but too slow in some sections. The drama is well done but the humor isn't that funny at all. The ending of this movie has been rip off a number of times. The nerd gets popular girl that concept was most recently used in The Faculty. The movie has some of the worst 80's music I have heard. Good performances make the bland characters convincing. Seth Green from Austin Powers plays Chuckie Miller. Currently out of print but available for rent.</fullReview>

But the movie goes deeper by forcing the former nerd, Patrick Dempsey, to make some tough decisions which will ultimately change not only himself but those around him.

		<fullReview>CBMY simply portrays the "in" vs "out" crowd in an entertaining and accurate fashion. Dempsey shows that the only real difference between "us" and "them" is perception and opportunity not "good" vs "evil".Some viewers will be afraid to enjoy this movie because of the underlying Moral. Because of the perception in Hollywood that a movie with a moral is selling out there are few films that present-day youth with the ability to look at some of the everyday emotional experiences through the eyes of an outsider. Oh, the moral is that if we are decent and respect ourselves then we can be secure in just being we.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>History has been kind to this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie came out in 1987, John Hughes defined the genre, and anything that wasn't exactly like that was immediately discarded--Ebert gave this movie just half a star, which even by the Hughes standard was a bit harsh. This one has a few things in common with Hughes. The sense of place: Tuscon is as much a character in this movie as Chicago is for Hughes. The details: Some of the best bits in this film aren't spotted until the umpteenth viewing. For example, how many people noticed that right after Ronnie asks Cindy, "What's his name? Biff?", we see that Brett's license plate starts with BYF. And so on.What this movie does that Hughes never did was show how much the "popular" kids were bigger sheep than the nerds trying to break in. "If the Ronster is doing it, it must be new!", and so everyone at the dance is spazzing out to the African Anteater Ritual (which, BTW, someone needs to mention on American Idol, just for the chance of making a pop-culture reference that stumps Randy and Simon but not Paula). We wouldn't see this played out that well again, until Mean Girls' "That's so fetch!" showed it from the other side.This is definitely worth TiVoing if you're in the mood for an 80's fix, but aren't feeling cynical enough for Heathers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. I must have watched this movie 500 times in the late 80's. The thing that makes it even more beautiful is that I'd forgotten all about this movie until recently and now I'm dieing to see it again. My copy should be here from Netflix tomorrow and I plan on watching it another 500 times. This movie had some classic lines in it:* "cards, chips, dips, and dorks" * "cold brew just not going to be the same" * "Quintan is here" &lt;--- I don't know why this makes me laughand my favorite:* Look, it's a nerd herdI'm sure my phrases are off, but I have't seen it in about 13 years, so I guess that's pretty good.In the cast listing it says that Seth Green played his little brother. I could swear that's not Seth Green. One more thing, that Cindy girl is so fine!! Shame she stopped acting.</fullReview>

Ronald ( beast ) falls for Cindy ( beauty ) I just love it :-) I feel that it could have been a little bit longer of a movie , it seems to be a good movie but it all happens too fast :-( I still love it :-) It is still to this day one of my many faveorite movies from the 80s:-) I mean the only way you can't like it is if you just didn't like the 80s or you just not into that kind of movies but i also agree if you liked Revenge of the Nerds then you will like this movie :-) 80s movies were big on GEEKS :-) Laugh Out Loud :-) Melissa</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge of the 80's: The white elephant movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can't Buy Me Love a.k.a. Boy Rents Girl (1987) is one of my "white elephant films". This is a movie that I would not have in my personal collection but whenever it's on T.V. I'll never miss it. I don't know why I like some of these type of movies. Maybe the theme of the movie is what interest me (more likely I watched it one day when I had nothing to do). This was another Patrick Dempsey film that came out during the late 80's (who was pushing this guy in Hollywood?).A gangly nerd who spends his spare time mowing lawns (he's saving up his money so he can buy a telescope) falls for a blonde girl. One time whilst at the mall looking at the telescopes, he notices his dream girl is in trouble. The dumb ditz ruined her mom's favorite outfit. At the spur of the moment he makes her one of the strangest offers around. What is it? You'll have to find out!Another totally 80's films. The gaudy clothes, mullet mania and the bad dance music that came out during this time period (don't forget the womens poofy hair). Hopefully none of these styles will ever come back into style again. Strangely enough, this movie was remade recently. I guess the film-makers can never get enough of this plot device. If you love those pesky 80's movies, then this one has nor name on it!!!Fair.Cxx</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't Buy Me Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never heard of this film before but it was a recommendation from Netflix so, after checking out an IMDb review, I watched.It was an enjoyable 80's teen comedy that is far superior to the usual John Hughes films that spring to mind when you think of 80's teen comedy.I give it a 6 but I would liked to have given it more. It had loads of potential to be a lot better, easily an 8, but some simple mistakes were made that let it down. Like using Patrick Dempsey as the lead when at no point is he convincing as a geek as he is far too handsome and has a good physique. His performance is confident rather than geeky also. Another reviewer has pointed this out and I agree.I also agree with the same reviewer who stated that Amanda Peterson's portrayal of the popular cheerleader is a compassionate one and makes it more watchable.There are some good scenes and some good laughs but throughout the whole thing I just kept thinking how much better it could have been if they'd have picked a better lead (I kept thinking of the better geek portrayals in Revenge of the Nerds), and spent a little more time on the characters, sub plots and jokes, which often felt like they all had so much potential that wasn't fully developed.I do like how the jocks and cheerleaders, while somewhat lampooned, also all have a sympathetic side. So credit is due to the writer and/or director for not making them two dimensional. Equally, there are moments that feel rushed, as if no one could be bothered to develop the characters adequately.Still, it is an easy to watch, enjoyable, charming film.</fullReview>

The positive reviews are all superstitious, they have nothing to do with the movie, it is just a nice memory from childhood. I rated the film 1 for many reasons. The main one would be that everything below 6 I always rate 1. The movie itself is just a typical cheesy 80s teen comedy with predictable events and too much filler. A few good jokes here and there but that's it. There are far better 80s teen flicks, say "Fast Times At Ridgemont High", "Porky's", "18 Again" or "Private Resort".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Parable of circular reasoning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ronny Miller was unpopular because he wasn't liked &amp; he wasn't liked because he was unpopular.That's circular reasoning on the part of his peers. By his "Ronny Miller Scam", as one of the students called it, he appeared to know that and set things up to get the feedback loop to work for him-instead of his having to work against it.In exchange for bailing Cindy out of(spoilers?)an expensive jam(which one of the "normal' students got her into, &amp; narcisticly shrugged off responsibility for)Ronny seized the opportunity to reverse the social feedback loop.It worked. They decided that since Cindy liked Ronny, he must be "cool" Ronny must have confused himself a bit though in proceeding to break up with Cindy, per their original arrangement,because it was evident that Cindy was who he wanted in the 1st place &amp; that popularity was his means to win Cindy-not vice versa. Noticing Cindy's reservations about the break up &amp; Ronny's enthusiasm for it,I wanted to yell into the TV"Dude-you GOT your girl!" Seen this movie 3 or 4 times &amp; he keeps breaking up at that point.LOLIt's also a movie about penalising what should be rewarded &amp; rewarding what should be penalised.Ronny reminded the Hedonistic upper class of how he &amp; the other "nerds" bailed some of the "superiors" out in younger years, &amp; how being irrationally stigmatized was the thanks they got.Lesson in responsibility.I wonder how many socially disenfranchised people would like to pull a Ronny Miller Scam.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightfully Entertaining!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie at least 3-4 times. I loved how well-rounded a lot of the characters were (at least in MY OPINION, many of them were). Amanda Peterson was a fantastic actress (even better than her male co-star, Patrick Dempsey). It's a shame that I have not seen nearly as much, of her, as I have of Patrick, over the last 14 years.This was a real "feel-good", "pick-me-up" movie, as far as I was concerned. How I was "cheering Ronald Miller's character on", when "dating" Cindy Mancini, cheerleader queen, actually DID make him popular.......after all those years of being the GEEK and the LAWN BOY........in his senior year, no less........What a way to go out!! She even told him that hanging out with her was not going to make himpopular, but she was wrong.......all so wrong. I also liked the way that Ronald's mother, who apparently was not used to her son dating, was truly touched and beaming with joy, when she saw her son and Cindy leaving their home on a date. She seemed so incredibly proud, as she watched her son go off, with probably the only girlfriend, that he ever had in all those years of school.Now I know that their dating relationship was all a farce.......But then I loved watching her slowly fall in love with him, for the REAL person that he was (and not because he was or was not popular). It's a shame that he was not smart enough to pick up on the fact the farce became the real thing. I'll never forget their date, with the telescope, the airplane graveyard and their truly REAL MOMENTS, in the car, that night, when the walls between the IN kids and the OUTCASTES crumbled completely.Last, but not least, I loved watching one of the other girls, whom Ronald dated, after he broke up with Cindy (and this, of course, was no longer a farce). Too bad I can't remember the character's name (it's been 14 years). She was the second girl whom he dated, after Cindy, however.......and she was the one who gave him his first chance, is his entire 17 years, to (how shall I say this delicately?......) appreciate her bulges!! (then he actually HILARIOUSLY did the math, WITHOUT A CALCULATOR, NO LESS, to figure out how many days, he had lived, without that experience!.......17-odd years X 365)!!Well, whoever she was, let me say, facetiously (and also seriously), she was HOT, truly beautiful and cute!!!.......even cuter than Amanda Peterson's Cindy Mancini.......and I wish that she had been the female star of that movie!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charming and cute 80's movie about a colorless high school nerd who desperately wants to get into the cool clique of jocks, quarterbacks and foxy cheerleaders. Ronnie Miller (Patrick Dempsey) pays the popular Cindy 1.000,00 $ to hang out with her for a month. And it works, too. Since the cherubic high school queen dates him, every other chick wants a piece of him too and every jock wants to booze with him. But, the cooler Ronnie becomes, the more he forgets about who his REAL friends are (the other nerds he plays poker with) and he even fails to notice that Cindy is developing honestly warm and romantic feelings for him?awww! 'Can't Buy me Love' isn't exactly the type of high-school comedy that'll have you rolling over the floor with chuckles but it perfectly knows how to create the right, wit atmosphere. It seems like director Steve Rash knows damn well what lives inside the walls of an average co-ed high school and I'm sure every viewer will recognize the caste system from his/her own school. Dempsey acts well but is outshined by Amanda Peterson, and she even looks better. Keep an eye open for Seth Green as Dempsey's brat brother. Can't Buy me Love is a rather modest, but very enjoyable movie. A lot better than the nowadays take on high school humor, which only involves jokes about sex and faeces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Can't Buy Me Love" is one of the worst youth oriented films of what was basically a bad era for almost any kind of film, the late 1980's. Patrick Dempsey hams it up portraying an unpopular high schooler who figures that buying dates and being used will help him make friends and be a good influence on the teenaged society. It's that stupidity alone that carries the rest of the film. Only highlight is the use of the classic title tune by The Beatles in the soundtrack.</fullReview>
