		<shortDescription>An invisible man sequel worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took Universal Studios seven years to produce this sequel to The Invisible Man, but in some regards, it was worth the wait. Geoffrey Radcliffe (Vincent Price) is an innocent man condemned to death for a murder he didn't commit. At the last minute, Radcliffe's gal pal, Helen (Nan Grey), and the friendly mad doctor, Frank Griffin (John Sutton), decide the only way to save Radcliffe is by injecting him with the invisibility serum invented by Jack Griffin. Radcliffe's invisibility enables him to escape the gallows and easily elude the police led by the wily Inspector Sampson (Cecil Kelloway). Radcliffe figures out the identity of the murderer but his behavior soon borders on madness, unsettling Dr. Griffin and Helen. Should they continue to aid Radcliffe or rat him out to the constabulary? Will Radcliffe remain sane long enough to clear his name or will the law have to gun him down like his phantom predecessor, Jack Griffin? This is a real rarity among sequels in that it is nearly as good as the original. It's one of my favorites in this genre. The story moves along briskly, features some intriguing scenes, and offers some occasional humor. The acting is solid. The special effects though primitive by today's standards are still effective. That doesn't mean it is without it share of faults. Chief among them is why they didn't inject Radcliffe earlier instead of waiting till the day of his execution? Or better yet, inject Helen, so she might solve the crime. Speaking of solving the crime, Radcliffe uncovers the real murderer's identity much too easily. Still, I would love to see Universal Studios remake this someday with a woman as the unseen protagonist/fugitive-Thandie Newton would be my choice. But, knowing Universal Studios, I probably couldn't get that lucky.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a lot of reasons why this 1940 sequel is better than the original INVISIBLE MAN. In the first movie, the Invisible Man was a dilettante, a haughty scientist who shot himself up with the invisibility drug "for kicks." Claude Rains played the character with such a supercilious air that it was hard to care when he lost it all.But in this well-written sequel, the Invisible Man is a true hero. Geoffrey Radcliffe is a wealthy gentleman with class, courage, and a sense of humor. Someone has framed him for murder, and with the help of his devoted girl friend and trustworthy company doctor, he sets out to make things right.Vincent Price is perfect as Geoffrey. He gives this invisible man plenty of guts, along with goodness, humility, and a wonderfully self-deprecating sense of humor. When madness sets in, of course, Price can babble with the best of them. But this time around, you care. This is a man who ran his business empire for the benefit of the workers, a man who can tease his weeping girl friend about how "lucky" she is not to see his face.Ladylike and innocent-looking Nan Grey is a horror legend for her bit role as the waif-like streetwalker in Dracula's Daughter. Here she gets to play the same gentle, sensitive type, only warmer and more womanly. Watching Helen Manson sit up all night watching over her suffering love, falling asleep in her chair, and fainting at the sight of his disfiguring bandages, you will fall in love with her yourself. It's easy to see why Geoffrey loves her enough to risk madness and death to be by her side, and why the villain was willing to stoop to murder for her sake.Sir Cedrick Hardwicke is mostly remembered today for playing kindly, kingly old gentlemen in epics like THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. But here he is a ruthless, cold villain, a murderer who fights for greed and gain. The attraction to lovely Helen is only hinted at, just a glance here and a tender word there. But it gives just the right touch of depth and tragedy to an amazingly nuanced performance.Just as many critics feel Dracula's Daughter was a deeper film than Dracula, so INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS may well be an improvement over the original classic.Long live Universal Horror!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Classic Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Invisible Man (1933) stands alone as being the greatest adaptation of H.G. Wells' story because it follows the novel's storyline and captures the atmosphere of the original work. The film also has the ability to polish some of the scenes with humor. Like other Universal horror classics, it deserved and got sequels, and though the Invisible Man Returns was a lesser effort, it was far superior than any other attempt to remake the classic (the recently made Hollow Man was down right horrible and, yes, hollow.) The Invisible Man Returns begins by introducing us to the brother of the first film's invisible one who escapes prison using the formula his brother developed. This is a far-fetched and awkward way to create a sequel, but once it's out of the way the rest of the film again captures the formula, fun and atmosphere of the original. Followed with mixed results by The Invisible Woman (comedy), The Invisible Agent, The Invisible Man's Revenge and Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (which features the Invisible One).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While certainly not as good as its original source(sans Claude Rains, sans James Whale), this sequel is very entertaining. It lacks the raw energy of the first film as well as the dark humour. The film begins with Geoffrey Radcliffe about to be executed for a crime we soon learn he did not do. How he gets out of his visit with the executioner is a little matter of drinking a potion given to him by a friend(the brother of the Claude Rains character in the original). In a matter of moments he(Vincent Price's voice) works toward finding his brother's true killer and fending off the madness that comes from drinking the invisibility solution. Price is in fine form though don't expect the hamminess you usually get(a bit disappointing for me). The rest of the cast is very good. Universal actress Nan Grey(from Dracula's Daughter) is lovely, and Cedric Hardwicke actually gives a convincing performance as a villain. Cecil Kellaway and Alan Napier also provide wonderful supporting help. The special effects really shine and are first-rate for their time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy sequel to THE INVISIBLE MAN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MORD39 RATING: ***(of ****)THE INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS is a fine followup to 1933's THE INVISIBLE MAN. Vincent Price has one of his earliest horror roles as a wrongly convicted man made transparent and out on a mission to find the real culprit who murdered his brother and framed him.Nan Grey has never looked prettier and lends nice support as the woman who loves Price. Cecil Kellaway is a treat as the suspicious police inspector, and Alan Napier is fun as a detestable villain who gets what he deserves.While not as intense as the original, this film surely stands out as one of the finest sequels from Universal's golden age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever approach to an "Invisible Man" sequel...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS is really the story of Frank Griffin's brother, Geoffrey (VINCENT PRICE), who is wrongly accused of murder and imprisoned. Helping him escape is a doctor (JOHN SUTTON) who injects him with a serum to make him invisible. Griffin then sets about trying to get to the bottom of who the real murderer is.That's the only weak spot in the story. The identity of the real murderer is known much too soon rather than stalling the revelation for better suspense.Lovely NAN GREY (who resembles blonde Brenda Joyce in so many scenes), is excellent as the love interest. She gives a warm and natural performance as the woman who sympathizes with Griffin's plight. VINCENT PRICE is fine until he has to show madness and descends into overacting with his maniacal laughter. SIR CEDRIC HARDWICKE and ALAN NAPIER set the standard for good acting among the supporting cast. Napier is especially effective as a man tormented by the Invisible Man in a scene that takes place in a lonely wooded area.There are times when the character of Frank Griffin is written in a way that is most unsympathetic and mean spirited and Price is especially nasty in conveying this aspect of his role. In other words, there's a touch of villainy in his performance.But the story is a clever one, standing apart from the original INVISIBLE MAN that starred Claude Rains and is well done. Some of the special effects may be a bit creaky but understandably so, and nevertheless the film is a fine example of how far those effects had advanced technically by the '40s.Well worth watching, especially if you're a fan of Universal's horror films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different than the original in many ways, but still a dandy film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In general, it seems that sequels seldom live up to the originals. There are just too many examples I can think of when this was the case. In addition, sequels that take an entirely different approach to the original subject matter often are abysmal failures as well (such as the wonderful VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED and it's incredibly awful and saccharine CHILDREN OF THE DAMNED). In light of this, I was very pleasantly surprised to this see that this film, while quite different from the fantastic original, is still an exceptional film.Much of the reason for the film being so good was that the film was made by Universal Studios during a very productive period for their horror films. They just knew how to put the whole package together to make a dandy film. Additionally, the cast really helped as well, as Vincent Price (mostly just his voice, as he IS invisible through almost all the film), Cedric Hartwicke, Cecil Kellaway and many others worked together to quite nicely. The writing, also, is a big standout, as the film COULD have easily been just another "hack" sequel. Using bits of humor here and there throughout the film and providing a great ending really made this film worth while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Invisible Man Returns (1940) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had watched this twice as a kid on Italian TV and remember loving it; however, as was the case with THE GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN (1942), when I caught up with it again as an adult via DVD, it proved something of a let down! Mind you, it's still a pretty good film and John P. Fulton's trick work is as brilliant as ever. And yet, I felt that it tried a bit too hard to duplicate those elements which made the original so successful to begin with: the eccentric Englishness so unique to Whale's work, for instance, comes off as somewhat heavy-handed this time around; the very young Vincent Price has yet to come into his own as a horror icon and his lapses into madness are overdone, not matching Claude Rains' menacing delivery. Besides, the identity of the villain is no mystery here! Still, while I particularly missed the wit of the original, Joe May's expert handling and Milton Krasner's effective lighting give the film a suitably Germanic feel at times. Ultimately, I feel that of all the first sequels to the original Universal monster films (BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN [1935], DRACULA'S DAUGHTER [1936], THE MUMMY'S HAND [1940] and FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN [1943]), this one is perhaps the least impressive - as all the others seemed to go in different directions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Transparent Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS (Universal, 1940), directed by Joe May, is, what is indicated during the opening credits, "a sequel to THE INVISIBLE MAN by H.G. Wells," capitalizes on the success of recent update sequels to old 1930s horror tales. Unlike the resurrections of the Frankenstein Monster in THE SON OF FRANKENSTEIN (1939), and later, Dracula and a new revised Mummy, all of whom have or would be resurrected from the dead through some supernatural means, Claude Rains, who originated the Invisible Man character in 1933, whose Jack Griffin was shot and killed by the police in the conclusion, would not have the power to be brought back from the dead as his monstrous contemporaries had, but to have an introduction to a new invisible man, played with distinction by Vincent Price. This sequel, however, not essentially a horror film, is a blend of science fiction and murder mysteryThrough the first few minutes of the story, it is learned to the viewer through lines of dialog from the servants that a young man named Sir Geoffrey Radcliffe (Vincent Price), sentenced to death for the murder of his brother, Michael, is scheduled for execution by hanging at dawn for the crime for which he is innocent. His fiancée, Helen Manson (Nan Grey), appeals to Geoffrey's cousin, Richard Cobb (Sir Cedric Hardwicke), to have the execution postponed in order to prove his innocence, but there's nothing he can do. Later that night, Geoffrey's friend, Doctor Frank Griffin (John Sutton), brother to the late Jack Griffin, who had experimented with chemicals that cause invisibility, comes to the prison to pay his last respects to Sir Geoffrey hours before his death sentence is to be carried out. Some time later, the guards discover that Sir Geoffrey has escaped and they are completely baffled as to how he had gotten by them without anyone seeing him. Discovering some clothing left behind in his cell, it is Inspector Sampson (Cecil Kellaway) of Scotland Yard who realizes how this was done, especially since he is very much familiar with the Jack Griffin case nine years previously, which causes him to suspect the late scientist's younger brother, Frank, into having something to do with Geoffrey's escape. The next scene then focuses on the movement of bushes and trees in the woods, with a suitcase full of clothes opening up by itself. Sir Geoffrey is now an invisible man, thanks to Griffin for his discovery of a secret formula known as duocaine, which would leave Geoffrey transparent and free to go about to learn the truth as to why he was framed and to clear his name by revealing the true murderer. But the problem is for Griffin to come up with an antidote to prevent Geoffrey from going insane and meeting the same fate as his brother.While not up to the wit and pace to THE INVISIBLE MAN, THE INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS done have some added bonuses. It's quite obvious, however, to take notes and compare the original film with its sequel. The leading ladies in both films (Gloria Stuart and Nan Grey) are not only blondes, but play fiancées to the leading character. Claude Rains was virtually unknown to movie audiences when chosen to play the invisible man while Vincent Price has had some exposure in movies since his feature debut in 1938. The one thing both Rains and Price had in common while playing invisible men on screen was their individual distinctive voices. As with the earlier film, the sequel takes time for some prank humor by the new invisible man as he stalks Willie Sphears (Alan Napier), a night watchman through the woods. It is believed that Mr. Sphears, who had testified against him at his trial, might be the sole witness to his brother's murder. At times amusing, this sequence ends with some unpleasantness after Geoffrey takes the fainted Mr. Sphears, ties his feet and arms behind him, and leaving him alone in a room standing helplessly on a stool with his neck placed inside a hanged noose. Special effects, compliments by John Fulton, take precedence throughout the story with Geoffrey removing his goggles, bandages and clothing only to reveal nothing underneath, as well as one interesting highlight where the now wounded and cold Geoffrey is alone in the country, talking to the scarecrow as he "borrows" its clothing for his own use.Forrester Harvey, who appeared as Herbert Hall in THE INVISIBLE MAN, returns in this sequel assuming another character role, that of Ben Jenkins. What a welcome added attraction THE INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS would have been had Forrester Harvey and Una O'Connor reprized their original roles as the scared innkeepers encountering another invisible man. THE INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS would spawn two more sequels in the 1940s, THE INVISIBLE AGENT (1942) and THE INVISIBLE MAN'S REVENGE (1944), each featuring Jon Hall playing descendants to Jack Griffin, concluding in 1951 when another invisible man meets up with Abbott and Costello. In order not to forget the originator to THE INVISIBLE MAN, a photo of Claude Rains would be evident, as was in THE INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS. The overly familiar instrumental Frank Skinner underscoring used during the closing cast credits of this production would be heard in several other Universal productions of that period, including THE SON OF FRANKENSTEIN, THE TOWER OF London (both 1939), and BLACK Friday (1940), all featuring Boris Karloff.THE INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS, available on video cassette and then onto DVD, and had played on several cable channels, including the Sci-Fi Channel in the 1990s, and on American Movie Classics in 1991, and brought back on that channel again from 2000 to 2001.

		<shortDescription>He becomes invisible to fight a bad rap.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very watchable sequel seven years after the original. This version is less dark and dreary and even contains a little comedy. Vincent Price plays Geoffrey Radcliffe, wrongly convicted of murder and makes use of invisibility to find the real murderer of his brother. This is Price's fifth movie early in his career. His face is seen very little in this sci-fi drama, but his distinct and haunting voice will prove to help him gain stardom.A very good supporting cast includes: the legendary Cedric Hardwicke, Cecil Kellaway and Nan Grey. Miss Grey is the stunning love interest. Kellaway usually plays a light comedic role, but this time he plays the part of a Scotland Yard inspector. Hardwicke is more or less that character you can't seem to put your full trust in. In other minor roles are John Sutton, Leyland Hodgson and Ivan Simpson.The special effects help this oldie keep its charm. My favorite scene is still when Grey faints after Price unravels his bandages. Still a hoot to watch.</fullReview>

Dr. Frank Griffin is a good friend of Geoffrey's and helps him to escape prison with invisibility. Can Radcliffe prove his innocence with the police hot on his trail? Can Dr. Griffin find an antidote to help Geoffrey before he goes completely insane? Yes the story and casting in this sequel is great - just as good as the original 'Invisible Man (1933)' with Claude Rains. In 'The Invisible Man Returns (1940)' is it the late great Vincent Price who plays Geoffrey Radcliffe, the Invisible Man.This is a sequel worth watching. Just like the original film, there is drama sprinkled with comedy - quite enjoyable to watch.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Clever Manipulation of the Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's certainly challenge to bring back a character when he dies in the original. Often some contrived plot manipulation is used and it doesn't satisfy. Why not do it the way they do here. In this, a respected man, played by Vincent Price, is convicted of a murder he didn't commit. At the eleventh hour, he escapes after being visited by a scientist who knows the secret of invisibility. An injection is used and when the guards open the door to see where he is, he rushes out, taking refuge in the home of his fiancée. The unfortunate reality is that the scientist has not found an antidote so he is trapped in his invisibility, facing the side effect of madness after a period of time. He is also pursued by a determined detective from Scotland Yard. His only option is to recognize his fate, and bring to justice the two men who committed and framed him for murder. There are some really delightful scenes here. This is a very young Vincent Price and he hasn't developed that characteristic voice yet. A very sound sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vincent Price (Radcliffe) is under prison guard and hours away from being hanged when he gets a visit from his doctor friend John Sutton (Griffin). Sutton is the scientist brother of the original Invisible Man and knows some tricks! Price then spends the film seeking justice for his own brother's murder.I found this film more funny than creepy. I couldn't take Price's invisible threats seriously and just laughed through most of his dialogue. And, unfortunately, he decides to ham it up when playing someone in the throes of going mad. His maniacal laughter is hilariously bad. As are his sudden outbursts to keep the dogs quiet early on in the film. I also found the foreman Alan Napier (Spears) unbelievable. Not in that his acting is to be faulted, I quite enjoyed his performance, but his accent is atrocious. That accent does not exist anywhere in the North of England or in Scotland or whatever he was trying to do. Shame he didn't just talk properly.Apart from the above silliness, the film moves at a good pace. Some of the effects are good, for example the Invisible man's outline being revealed when Police Inspector Cecil Kellaway blows cigar smoke in his direction. There is also an involving chase sequence when the invisible Price comes after his evil relative Cedric Hardwicke (Cobb). The film keeps the attention and I think it won't disappoint those who are fans of this genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if this constitutes "blasphemy", but as far as the Universal horrors go, I found this film to be just as enjoyable, if not better than the original "Invisible Man" picture with Claude Rains.Vincent Price--who had yet to have his name become synonymous with horror--turns in a fantastic performance as the "Invisible One." His voice and delivery are almost on par with Rains, as Price's character has to take on the burden of invisibility because he's been wrongly accused of murder.Price's slow descent into madness is fun to watch--i.e. the dinner table scene when he's going on about how he can rule the world. I also enjoyed Cecil Kellaway as the Scotland Yard Agent, especially some of his witty banter to some of the fumbling policemen we see throughout this picture.There's also a great exchange between 2 policemen who are talking about the Invisible One and the supernatural as one of them says "I don't hold with no spiritualism." And the photographic effects by the great John P. Fulton are top notch.Overall, "The Invisible Man Returns" rates to me as one of the finer films from Universal's 2nd wave of horror during the 1940s.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Geoffrey Radcliffe (Vincent Price) is sentenced to hang for a murder he didn't commit. His friend, Dr. Frank Griffin (John Sutton), is the brother of the original Invisible Man and has been continuing his brother's research. Frank uses the invisibility formula to help Geoffrey escape prison so he can prove his innocence. But the side effects of the formula start to drive Geoffrey crazy, just as they did Frank's brother years before.Great sequel to the Invisible Man doesn't match that film but it's very entertaining in its own right. Good cast, good special effects, solid story. Vincent Price's first foray into horror films. He's no Claude Rains in the part but he does well. John Sutton is likable, if somewhat bland. Cedric Hardwicke is a slimy villain. Nice part for Alan Napier (Alfred on the '60s Batman TV series) as a crony of Hardwicke's. Pretty Nan Grey gets little to do but be worried. She looks great doing it though. Cecil Kellaway is excellent playing against type as the dogged police inspector on Radcliffe's trail.Universal had great luck with the sequels in their various monster series. I can't think of a single one that I would say is a bad movie not worth watching. This one is very good and restarts the Invisible franchise quite nicely. There would be three more Invisible movies to follow in the early '40s, each very different but all enjoyable movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released a surprising seven years after James Whale's fantastic and commercially successful The Invisible Man (1933), this sequel faces the problem of creating a story worth telling, without recycling the events and themes that ran through the original and H.G. Wells' novel of the same name. Pleasingly, Returns is an exciting little horror film, that boasts the same fantastic (and Oscar nominated) special effects as the first, as well as offering Vincent Price in one of his very first horror roles.Falsely imprisoned for the murder of his brother, Sir Geoffrey Radcliffe (Price), the owner of a mining corporation, awaits the death sentence. As his execution looms close, Radcliffe suddenly disappears from his cell, baffling the guards who are placed under suspicion. Knowing Radcliffe to be innocent, Dr. Frank Griffin (John Sutton), the brother of Claude Rains' original Invisible Man, has injected him with the invisibility drug so Radcliffe may conduct his own investigation into the murder. But with Scotland Yard detective Sampson (Cecil Kellaway) suspecting Griffin and the drug slowly turning him mad, Radcliffe faces a race against time to find the culprit and cure himself of the effects of the drug.This is one of those old-fashioned horror films that adhere to all the genre clichés and never really surprises you, but the cast and execution of the film is wholly charming. The plot keeps things interesting, as the sympathetic innocent man is slowly driven to madness that is beyond his control. Price, although only appearing for less than a minute, had yet to hone his acting craft, but manages to carry the film using only that voice which is now so embedded in horror culture. It's not a patch on Whale's masterful original, but The Invisible Man Returns is a worthy sequel, remaining thoroughly entertaining throughout, kick-starting one of many lucrative franchises for Universal Studios.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surpringly good entrance to brief return of H.G. Well's legendary science fiction legend.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a performance by an actor mostly utilized through voice only, Vincent Price is truly memorable. Yes, he allows that famous profile to be covered in gauze, and on occasion, his voice is muffled. But as the British aristocrat falsely accused of murder, Price is both comical and touching, and in this, the first follow-up to 1933's masterpiece "The Invisible Man", the result is above average.There's a truly memorably sequence when he gently talks to a scarecrow as he strips it of its clothes, obviously freezing in his unexposed nudity, and a comical one where he uses his voice to scare a witness of the actual murder he was accused of into thinking he is his own ghost. Price's voice goes from petrified to relieved (as he escapes from death row) to sudden calm, then worried as he faces pending insanity. His voice is truly convincing as he expresses all of these emotions.The other memorable performance is by Sir Cedric Hardwicke as the obvious villain, and the final sequence on a coal loading device is pretty frightening. What makes this entry stand above its follow-ups is the fact that the actual invisible man is allowed to be truly worthy of sympathy, and with that, Price's performance is outstanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The writer of the summary needs to watch the movie again- Vincent Price is NOT related to the Invisible Man Griffin, nor his brother. His character name is Radcliffe.Personally, I don't think that Price was doing that much over-acting- when the part called for him to be deranged,it seems that his portrayal was accurate. Nan Grey plays her part well- and is as lovely as she was in "Dracula's Daughter." I find Cecil Kellaway's Inspector Sampson to be a little too self-assured in parts, but Alan Napier shows a depth of characterization far beyond that which he would show in his role of Alfred the butler in the 1960s "Batman" television show. Though this sequel is not as impressive as Claude Rains "Invisible Man"-it remains a worthy sequel- far better than "Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vincent Price Stars In His First Horror Film Role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Invisible Man was Universal's top grossing horror film next to Frankenstein and the studio eagerly secured a contract with novelist H.G. Welles to produce sequels despite the visionary author's dislike of Claude Rains interpretation of Jack Griffen. The Invisible Man Returns was the first sequel followed later the same year by the the light-hearted The Invisible Woman. Price plays a murder suspect who is given the invisibility serum by a sympathetic Frank Griffen (brother to the original invisible man) in order for him to prove his innocence. Price's distinctive voice serves him well given that he has less than one minute of screen time before the Oscar nominated invisibility special effects take over. It's nowhere's near as fine as the 1933 James Whale masterpiece but fans of the old school Universal horrors should find it entertaining.</fullReview>

Nan Grey plays Geoffrey's girlfriend Helen. They both must watch him carefully, as he may go insane like Frank's brother did, since that flaw in the serum hasn't been fixed yet, and indeed the symptoms turn up before long... Excellent continuation of the story has fine acting and atmosphere, with a smart script that cleverly references the first film without repeating it. Identity of the real killer may be obvious, but film is briskly directed by Joe May, and remains quite memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following the release of "Dracula's Daughter" in May 1936, horror fans would have to wait almost three years before getting another fright picture from Universal Studios. With the opening of "Son of Frankenstein" in January 1939, however, the floodgates were opened for the second great wave of Universal horror. And in January 1940, still another sequel was released by the studio, "The Invisible Man Returns." A fairly ingenious follow-up to "The Invisible Man" feature of 1933, which was itself based on H.G. Wells' classic "scientific romance" (as Wells preferred to call such tales) of 1897, the 1940 film was successful enough at the box office to spawn no less than three further sequels! The film is historically important today, of course, inasmuch as it was the very first horror picture to feature Vincent Price, the beloved star who, over the next 50 years, would carve out a place of honor for himself in the Horror Pantheon. But as with Claude Rains in the first film, we do not get to see Price's face here until the final few seconds; otherwise, his mug is under wraps or, well, you know...invisible. That mellifluous voice of his, however, just cannot be mistaken!The sequel picks up nine years after the original, in which Rains' Jack Griffin, a noted biochemist, had perfected an invisibility formula employing the East Indian herb "duocane," used it on his own person successfully, had rapidly gone mad, failed to come up with an antidote to his serum, and had been shot dead by the constabulary after killing many people himself. Now, his brother, Frank Griffin, uses the same formula on his good friend, Geoffrey Radcliffe, who is on Death Row after having been falsely accused of killing his brother Michael. While Geoffrey's cousin Richard and girlfriend Helen fret uselessly--"They'll shoot him on sight," says the unknowing Richard--the invisible Radcliffe breaks out of jail and prosecutes his search for the real killer. Unfortunately, the same tendency toward madness that the formula had induced in Griffin nine years earlier soon starts to catch up with Radcliffe himself...."The Invisible Man Returns" boasts any number of fine elements that combine to make it a perfectly valid and effective sequel. Foremost of all, perhaps, is its sterling cast of pros. Price, in his fifth film (the picture was released just two weeks before "Green Hell" and three months before "The House of the Seven Gables"), is just wonderful, whether swathed in bandages or completely out of sight, and his supporting players are all uniformly fine: Cedric Hardwicke, in his first film following "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," as cousin Richard Cobb; Nan Grey (who had appeared in "Dracula's Daughter") as the pretty Helen; John Sutton (who had performed along with Price in "The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex" AND "Tower of London" prior to this film) as the faithful and hardworking Dr. Griffin; Cecil Kellaway (who would also appear in "...Seven Gables") as the dogged Scotland Yard Inspector Sampson, who delivers the most sarcastic comments with a lovable, twinkly smile; and an almost unrecognizable Alan Napier (unrecognizable, that is, for those who might recall him as Alfred on TV's "Batman") as Spears, the nasty enforcer at Cobb's colliery factory. The film has been expertly directed by Joe May, a German who in essence launched the career of Fritz Lang, and who would also direct Price and Kellaway in "...Seven Gables," and features wonderful special FX that hold up marvelously well today. Especially impressive are the shots of our Invisible Man as seen through billowing smoke, when he becomes partially visible (it was only during a second viewing that it struck me just why Sampson was constantly puffing cigar smoke into the air), and Radcliffe's materialization at the finale. The film has been beautifully shot in B&amp;W by Milton R. Krasner, here at the outset of what would turn out to be a 40-year career, serving as DOP of such B&amp;W masterpieces as "The Set-Up," "House of Strangers," "All About Eve" and "Deadline U.S.A." His lensing of the outdoor sequences--such as the one in which the invisible Radcliffe torments Spears in a forest glade for information--is especially well done. As for the Invisible Man himself, he is not nearly as nasty a piece of work as in the original film; not nearly as homicidal or maniacal. Still, his speech to Griffin and Helen regarding "a changed world with me as its guiding genius" tips the viewer off that the man is indeed starting to lose his invisible marbles! And as to the film's central mystery--just who did kill brother Michael?--well, that conundrum should be fairly simple to figure out, even for the most dim-witted of viewers (I DID mention that the always hissable Cedric Hardwicke is in the cast, right?). The film is a fairly serious affair, with a bare minimum of the occasional silly humor to be found in many another horror outing of the '40s; by contrast, the next film in the series, "The Invisible Woman," is an out-and-out comedy, and a very funny one, at that! Fast moving, compact, highly clever and often beautiful to look at, "The Invisible Man Returns" is, ultimately, one sequel that really must be, um, seen....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great follow-up to a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Invisible Man Returns" is a really fun and entertaining sequel to a classic.**SPOILERS**Hours to go before his death, Geoffrey Radcliffe, (Vincent Price) manages to escape from the prison with no trace, forcing the top Scotland Yard Inspector, Sampson (Cecil Kellaway) to the case. When he finds his fiancée Helen, (Nan Grey) waiting for him, he announces his intention of hunting the party responsible for his brother's death that sent him to prison. While the police try to catch him, family friend Frank Griffin, (John Sutton) is trying to perfect the re-invisibility serum which he has difficulty doing. As he starts to go mad from the effects of invisibility, they start to question his sanity until they become convinced that there isn't any way he can return from the process and must use all their powers together to stop him.The Good News: This was a really fun and entertaining sequel. The invisibility effects, as always in these kinds of films, are consistently excellent, even better than the work done on the original. The old tricks, like walking clothing, floating props and such, are refined and as seamless as one could hope to get. There are times when the handiwork is more impressive than the glut of computer effects today simply because there's a basis of physical reality in the unreal illusions. Besides these, the other, new effects in the film are improved greatly from the already impressive invisibility effects in the original. There's a very entertaining bit in the lab where the scientist is testing an experimental serum on guinea pigs where he uses harnesses in order to keep track of the invisible guinea pigs and the harnesses are constantly running around by themselves. It also works very well when one becomes visible again, showing first the skeleton and then the flesh over that. Another spectacular effect is when Radcliffe takes off his goggles and looks at himself in the mirror. He sees the empty interior of his head, the light clearly shining through the bandages that wrap his head. Very impressive stuff, as well as the effects that allow us to see Geoffrey in outline when cigar smoke is puffed in his face or when he's out on a rainy day. The effects are seamless, and really carry most of the film. Although it doesn't have the black humor of the original, it does have quite a few amusing moments. The hero gets a few choice lines in himself, with one about getting a job haunting a house in particular hilarious. In addition, there are many humorous scenes involving the pursuing policemen that manage to get some really great lines as well. Also on the plus side, the police investigation shows that the police have learned a thing or two from having dealt with an invisible man in the past. The policeman's trick, the nonchalant way he smokes cigars with the intent of capturing his outline in the smoke makes for a very effective scene. The whole sequence, with the capturing of the house for search and using a combination of stationed figures and smoke is fun to watch, leading to the film's highlight. The other big plus is that the film really manages to keep the interest level up. It's always doing something, and that leaves very few segments that aren't interesting or exciting. The conclusion in particular, which is handled well, and the house search scenes come off the best because of this. All together, this was a really noteworthy sequel.The Bad News: There really isn't a whole lot here that can drag this down. The only major problem is that the film plays pretty much like the first one. Man appears to fiancée as invisible, spends the rest of the film evading the police while continuing on with his original plan, whatever it is. It's pretty much the same, and the lack of any originality, other than a few spots here and there, is pretty disappointing. It's a rehash with few new points, and a little bit more would've been a lot better. It does get a little slow whenever talk about the cure comes up, and the back-and-forth nature of it produces few chills. Better to have introduced it, then only have it mentioned so that some suspense could've been brought up over whether or not it would be completed in time. Beyond these points, though, this is a really fun and entertaining entry in the series.The Final Verdict: With some minor and really unimportant nags, this is a really great entry in the series and is just as good as the original. That said, it's really nothing that the original didn't do, so if you've seen the original and don't feel like seeing this one, it's not a requirement, but recommended for those who want more or are huge fans of Price.Today's Rating-PG: Mild Violence</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Geoffrey Radcliffe (Vincent Price) is unjustly accused of murder. Frank Griffin (John Sutton), the brother of the first Invisible Man, injects him with the invisibility potion so he can escape from prison and find the real murderer. But will he be able to find him before the potion drives him mad? Silly and unbelievable from the beginning but fast-moving. You never really have time to think how stupid the story is. But you're watching this for the special effects--NOT the story. The special effects are incredible--even better than the first. Quite impressive for 1940.The acting is good. Price has to do all his acting with his voice (you don't see him till the end) but he has that smooth cool voice that carries it. Seeing him at the end so young and without a moustache is quite a surprise! The rest of the cast is just OK--although Nan Grey does try to put something in her thankless love interest role. Cecil Kellaway also has a few good moments as the Chief of Police.Still this is worth seeing for special effects alone. Just don't examine the story too closely. A 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>EXCELLENT sequel to the classic original. Although it can't match the original this is an excellent film in it's own right with top notch performances all around. It's always entertaining with an exciting finale and it manages to be somewhat eerie sometimes as well, and in my opinion Vincent Price did just a good a job as Claude Rains did i LOVED both there performances and both were perfect choices. The direction is good keeping things at a very fast pace plus the Lead female is much better this time around and not annoying. There is no gore what so ever. The Acting is AWESOME. Vincent Price is incredible as The Invisible Man although his style is a bit different then Claude Rain's was it works just as well along with Claude Rains, Vincent Price can also play any type of role. Cedric Hardwicke is an excellent actor here is no different he does very well. Nan Grey is fine here and is much better then Gloria Stuart was. John Sutton was excellent here as the Doctor and he was very likable. Overall a terrific sequel that i highly recommend! **** out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Vincent Price Film still good, with dazzling special effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Basic Plot: A man who has been accused of murdering his brother is made invisible by the brother of the original Invisible Man, and he finds and tortures those who framed him.The Praise: Excellent special effects, especially during the stunning, harrowingly suspensful climax. The film has a great buildup to the climax , spiraling upwards from the time Vincent Price goes power-mad to the romance ending. Along the way he tortures those who framed him in several scenes that almost are as harsh as the original. I liked Nan Grey, very pretty ( as a previous reviewer said). Remember her as Lily from "Dracula's Daughter". Vincent Price turns in a fine performance , and occasionally you see a faint shade of the man you saw in the Poe Films and "House of Wax", such as where he becomes visible at the end ( in a groundbreaking visual effect) you can see the hairline and features just beginning, and in his moments of madness it could be Roderick Usher as a young man. One of the first horror/sci-fi scripts by Curt Siodmak ( he died very recently). The Flaws: Plot can be a bit confusing at times, and it is a bit slow occasionally.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the original but still a good sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Invisible Man is one of the greats of its genre so The Invisible Man Returns had a lot to live up to. It is not as good, I did feel it could have been longer, the real murderer's identity is revealed far too soon and is not a big surprise and while there are some nice humorous spots some of the dark humour is on the heavy-handed side. However, as a sequel it does not fail anywhere near as badly as others have. It is filmed beautifully, directed with style and has some great effects for back then and now. The music mayn't be the most original of all scores but it is haunting, while there is some humorous dark wit in the dialogue to make up for the instances that don't quite work and the story is creepy and fun. Although he spends much of the movie invisible, Vincent Price early on in his long career in the title role is perfect, his voice distinctive and his delivery droll and somewhat menacing. Nan Grey's role is not as interesting but she gives a gentle and warm performance that does make the audience warm to her. Cecil Kelloway has some fine moments as the inspector, while Alan Napier looks as though he is having fun and Cedric Hardwicke is wonderfully ruthless. All in all, a good sequel that doesn't equal the original but is leagues ahead of many other sequels I've seen. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tasty sequel, far from lazy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Falsely imprisoned for fratricide, Geoffrey Radcliffe (Vincent Price) takes a drug to make him invisible and thus escape. But as he sets about trying to clear his name, the side effect of the drug, gradual madness, threatens to usurp his plans.It was never going to be up on the same level as the first film, The Invisible Man (1933), a genuine classic Universal Studio production that does justice to the great H.G. Wells writing. But instead of going for a lazy cash in, this sequel puts its own stamp on the invisible man premise and rounds out as an intelligent story with dashes of humour and sadness placed within. John Fulton's effects work is still amazing for the era, the cast list is boosted by the likes of Cecil Kellaway, Cedric Hardwicke and Nan Grey, while the finale is rewarding and worth waiting for.Faults? A couple, such as the real murderer is revealed too quickly, thus we lose mystery momentum, and director Joe May often lets the pace sag. But these fail to stop the film from achieving its entertaining aims. It hardly constitutes horror as such, but there's good dramatic worth, berserker science and a cast making the material work. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a wealthy mine operator (Vincent Price as Geoffrey Radcliffe) is falsely convicted for the murder of his brother and sentenced to death, his fiancée and the brother of the original Invisible Man use the dead scientist's formula to engineer an escape. Of course, the viewer will remember that the formula creates madness as well as invisibility, so Geoffrey Radcliffe must find the real killer, prove his innocence and an antidote to the invisibility formula before he goes mad or is recaptured by the police.The special effects in this movie rival its predecessor and still hold up as well today as they did then. The plot is a bit far fetched (but is any plot about an invisible man NOT far fetched?), but it works fairly well. Vincent Price is portrayed as a more sympathetic character in this one than Claude Raines was as the original Invisible Man but carries his role well. Sir Cedric Hardwicke is convincing as the villain in this one.While this is a worthy sequel, I still prefer the original Invisible Man more. This one should appeal to fans of the Universal Horrors and of The Invisible Man in particular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Price you can't see WILL scare you?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "Invisible Man", with Claude Rains, is one of the greatest horror milestones Universal Studios ever produced, but it will sadly also always remain the most underrated one; especially in comparison to films like "Frankenstein", "The Wolf Man" and "Dracula" which received a lot more recognition and cult following. This sequel, released a good seven years after the original, isn't a very phenomenal or spectacular movie but it's definitely interesting enough to track down and watch for a number of reasons. "The Invisible Man Returns" boosts one of the first leading roles of the legendary Vincent Price ? the very first horror role even, if you don't count the historical drama/horror hybrid "Tower of London" ? although you'll have to be extremely patient if you want to catch a glimpse of his charismatic face. At the beginning of the film, Geoffrey Radcliffe (Price) is in jail, only a couple of hours away from wrongfully being hung for the murder on his brother, with whom he shared the ownership of a coal mine. Geoffrey escapes, thanks to the help of his friend Dr. Griffin who smuggled in the famous drug that makes you invisible. Now Geoffrey can search for the real murderer, but he will have to hurry because the drug reputedly drives you insane, like what happened to Dr. Griffin's brother in the original. "Revenge of the Invisible Man" is a clever and wittily scripted sequel with a plot that at least doesn't blindly cash in on the original. The story introduces some praiseworthy other themes, like murder mystery and conspiracy theories. There isn't that much action, but many of the special effects remain fascinating to look at even though they are basic illustrations of ordinary handlings. Certain sequences are also extremely atmospheric and suspenseful, like when Geoffrey confronts the real murderer with the facts or when he uses a gas-resistant Darth Vader costume to escape from a mansion infested with Scotland Yard inspectors. The film even gets better when Geoffrey's madness kicks in and he openly begins to fantasize about dictatorship, tremendous powers and perverse possibilities. It is exactly then where you recognize the REAL Vincent Price. A guy who petrifies people with his boisterous voice and maniacal laughter even if you can't see his face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Invisible Man Returns, The (1940) *** (out of 4) The brother of the invisible man from the previous film turns a prisoner (Vincent Price) about to die invisible so that he can try to prove his innocence. The prisoner, with the help of his girlfriend (Nan Grey) tries to prove that an evil mastermind (Cedric Hardwicke) was behind his brother's murder. This "sequel" to THE INVISIBLE MAN doesn't come close to matching the original movie but after a rather sluggish opening thirty-minutes, this film picks up and manages to deliver some nice special effects and a few effective performances. The biggest star of this film are the special effects, which are extremely good especially the scenes where Price is undressing. The effects from the original film hold up extremely well today but so do these. Another highlight is when the invisible man has some cigar smoke blown on him, which makes him visible. Towards the end there's a very effective scene with the invisible man walking down the street, with some clothes on, as people look in horror at him. Price, in his first horror film (if you don't count TOWER OF London as horror) is pretty good, although that great voice of his isn't used as effective as it would be later in his career. He makes for a good hero and Hardwicke is perfect as the cold blooded bad guy. I think this film lacks the humor of the original and again, the opening scenes of the film aren't that good but everything picks up and in the end this is an entertaining entry in Universal's new era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Invisible Man Returns opens with certain characters mourning over Vincent Price's situation on death row for the murder of his brother. But when he's to be led to the gallows, Price is gone from his cell, and we learn that he has used an invisibility potion to escape. Price is Geoffrey Radcliffe, his associate, Dr. Frank Griffin (John Sutton), a scientist (and brother to Claude Rains' invisible scientist from the first film), are best friends. Griffin works in a laboratory located inside the building that funds a coal mining operation which provides the Radcliffe fortune. Cecil Kellaway is Scotland Yard's Inspector Sampson, out to find Geoffrey, a fugitive on the lam. Nan Grey (many might know her as a female victim of Dracula's Daughter) is Helen, Geoffrey's fiancé, an obsession of Richard Cobb (Sir Cedric Hardwicke), a member of the operating group overseeing Radcliffe Collieries?and also responsible for the elevator shaft murder of Geoffrey's brother, eyeing the head position if the Radcliffes are out of the way, as well as, attaining Helen. So when Geoffrey learns of Cobb's crime from boozing coal mine leader (made superintendent by Cobb after seeing Richard murder Geoffrey's brother), Spears (Napier who is a hoot as the drunken, uncouth nitwit), he will use his invisibility to outwit Scotland Yard's finest and seek revenge (or, more importantly, a murder confession). But, as the invisibility drug remains in Geoffrey's system, the more he goes mad, soon rambling about using this power for villainous, nefarious purposes to Helen and Frank who become rightfully worried of losing control of their beloved. Will Geoffrey get a confession, lose his sanity, or get caught (or, worse, shot) by the police? "The Invisible Man Returns" is recognized by some (including me) to be Vincent Price's first horror film. But, you will have critics saying this movie is not a horror film, even though it has an invisible man slowly going mad, the Scotland Yard after him, Hardwicke concealing his crime, and the threat of murder if Geoffrey doesn't get an antidote to halt his progressing dementia. There's a gnarly scene where a victim falls from an escalator to his doom when the coal buggy unlocks sending him plummeting several feet. You get some cool "invisibility effects" such as contents removed from a hidden suitcase and bushes brushed aside or removing his articles of clothes and the bandages that cover his face ("He took off his clothes?no wonder she fainted!"). Especially neat is how you can see an impression of Price in rain, cigar smoke, and gas as Sampson and the police of Scotland Yard try to bottle him up in Radcliffe manor. Someone like me would particularly find the scene where a wounded Price (shot by police during a scuffle up a coal mining escalator with Cobb) steals the clothes off of a scarecrow amusing. Familiar faces, known by us who have watched countless Universal horror films in the famous monster franchises, appear in bit parts. I think Price buffs owe it to themselves to seek out this underrated, relatively undervalued sequel to the heralded James Whale classic, with similarly praise-worthy effects, but a more serious approach (although, there's still plenty of humor) and an ending that will probably be more audience-friendly (if you prefer a more happy ending). Price only has one scene where he is visible to us; his voice has to inform to us how he feels. There's an entire scene where Hardwicke must convince us that he is being forced to confront Spears, held by an invisible man at gunpoint the whole way?he doesn't fail in this regard.</fullReview>
