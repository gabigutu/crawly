		<shortDescription>don't read what it's about - just watch it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that having made that comment, it is obviously difficult for me to then expect you to read this. But bear with me here. This really is an excellent film and I went to see it having seen a very good trailer for it. The problem is that for the first half of the film I was wondering how we got to the bit I'd seen in the trailer (it's also in promotional stills and the poster). Although this is natural and happens with many films, it is not such a key element of the plot usually as it is in this film. From a very mundane beginning this film develops into the 'thriller' which it is billed as. But the true strength of this film lies in following the journey of the lead character who doesn't know what is going until it is too late. To get the full effect of this film you really ought to see it 'blind'. Even if you know something about it I'd still definitely recommend it. Filmed in black and white and focused very much on the lead character it tells a chilling story very well indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best first piece of work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remarkable first movie by a young France filmmaker really impressed me and without any doubt it had been one of the most beautiful screening in the Festival of Venice.It's a black and white sadistic journey through the misery of men. The protagonist, an immigrant twenty year old guy, struggles to survive and works fixing a roof, when the owner of the house he's working at dies of overdose he gets to know that he's not going to be paid and decides to replace the man in a mysterious job outside town. He finds himself involved in a whirl of violence that will take away from him any form of innocence.I strongly recommend it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thrilling absurd tale of extreme human behavior</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is little one can say about the story without giving away its core absurdity. The first half is a mystery. In the second we are thrown into a violent hell. (For the sensitive: the gore is minimal and mostly off camera.) The film reintroduces us to the fact that the repetitiveness of violence deadens our revulsion to it. Here it applies to the main character in the film and to us as audience. It is disturbing how quickly we get used to each eruption of violence and come to see it as a game. This habituation is what soldiers in war, butchers, and grandma slicing the chicken's neck to get it ready for dinner go through. Death as means to an end. Ultimately an allegory of the predatory nature of power and money.Filmed in B/W. Blood is dark gray which helps tame our revulsion. The director's brother plays the main role. He does a competent job. Filmed in wide format. Superb editing maintains the tension from beginning to end. As I understand it, "Tzameti" means thirteen. See the film to understand why the film is so named.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable tension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very impressive debut film by a young french filmmaker. What starts out initially as a seemingly simple tale soon turns into a twisted thriller. The amount of tension this film builds is incredible. You'll be hooked. The black and white filming fits perfectly. I gives the film a different edge that I don't think would have been the same had it been filmed in color.On a side note, I thought the lead actor, besides having an uncanny resemblance to James Franco, did a solid job. His emotions came across as very believable, and not forced. This film is highly recommended. Be sure to avoid spoilers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a perfect thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a brilliant movie. It's not a bloated Hollywood concoction, derived of any original idea or emotion. It tells its story and ends, does not linger endlessly and unnecessarily. It revolves around a single bright idea, which it carries and improves through its length. The fact that it's shot in B/W only adds to the effect, making it more gritty and realistic. It also enhances the expressions of characters, making them more artistic.The casting is perfect as well, in my opinion. At times, I got the feeling that I'm watching real people and not actors. Great soundtrack which doesn't convolute every scene as silence plays a big role in the movie, building the tension.This movie just reminds what cinema is really about; why films move people and make them feel things. It's an absolute treat.Lastly, this movie has the single best sequence I saw in a movie for a long time. It's raw,gripping and nerve racking. Also, pay attention to sounds and looks, which at times tells a whole sentence. Do not watch any trailers or read any detailed reviews on this film to feel the full effect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, its b&amp;w. Yes, its foreign. Yes, its low budget. Yes, its worth watching.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First: this movie starts slow. Stick with it ? no matter what! The film makers aren't wasting your time. They're taking you someplace you never would have guessed, not in a hundred years. Second ? it is a superb film. Great story well told. A low budget film that does not seem at all low budget. Also, a good film for a student of film. A very good example a minimalist approach. The director very much lets the story tell itself. The camera is very unobtrusive. There is no artificial manipulation of the emotions by music, sound or special fx. Every thing is low key, just a little excitement by some key actors, just as it would be. Great film making? Yes; taught, tense, exciting, nerve racking.Also, a great example of how you can still make a great film without a lot of blood, gore or sex. What?..... your thinking.... how can you do that? Watch the film and find out.How low budget is this? One suspects it was shot in b &amp; w more for budgetary reasons than style. However, this director demonstrates such a mastery of his craft that it may be intentional. For which ever reason, it works.Good casting, too, even though there was a little nepotism. Even the fat guy was well cast.Last, as another critic advised: the less you know going into this film, the better. However, I give this one piece of information: Tzameti means '13' in Georgian (as in the Caucasus's not the United States....). So, the title reads: "13?.13". Even this makes sense if you note three things?..Sit back and enjoy.... although later you'll be on the edge of your seat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dark, ironical, surprising, full of tension, sad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm so grateful for having seen this movie on the silver screen. It's an amazingly dark film, in the style of Man Bites Dog, and it also has some elements of Eli Roth's Hostel. If you like movies with that dark atmosphere, don't miss this one! A young man who is hired to fix up an old house, finds a mysterious letter that has instructions. When he decides to follow them, more letters and instructions follow, and eventually he ends up in a house in the middle of the woods where he and others have to face a difficult task, in order to please the rich. If (the word IF is very important) he survives, he gets a lot of money. I'd love to tell you more about it, but it would ruin the surprise.At the end, when you're watching the credits, I think you'll feel more satisfied than watching any American movie. This one has an ending, it can't have a sequel. The ending is quite ironical, it's been a while since a movie really surprised me with that. It's amazing what kinds of risks non-American movie makers take, what they put their characters through.The cinematography was also surprising, it's a black and white movie, very stylish, film-noir like. Artsy, but not at all MTV-like. Once you get into the story, you'll begin to love the black and white, it's been such a good decision, and it adds to the atmosphere.I had never seen a Georgian movie before so i was very excited and all my wishes came true. It was way better than i expected and when it's out on DVD, I'll rent it again, or buy it, that's for sure.One last thing, if Géla Babluani's writing and directing a movie again, i hope it will be as awesome, dark and surprising again! He could be the Georgian Tarantino. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Babluani is powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Briefly, this is a melodrama about a young handyman who, stiffed for his pay by a "dead"beat client, naively takes his customer's place in a big stakes game that he suspects can make him more than good for the money due him. But the joust turns out to be, essentially, an elaborate game of Russian roulette.Though the film and the language is French, the auteur, Gela Babluani, is from Georgia (that's the Georgia that used to be part of the USSR). His choice for the final turn of plot reflects, I think, the mores of Tbilisi rather than the sane moral relativism of today's West. But the look, the precision, the atmosphere, the tension Babluani produces are awestriking. The lead character, Sebastien, is played by George Babluani, a relative of the director I would guess. This young actor is handsome,lithe, intense, with a gift of expression that is magical.Comparing Director Babluani , now in his 20's, with, say, Scorsese at the same age, Scorsese was doing imaginative, promising but still academic pieces. Babluani is sure, electric, the technique never shows. Jim Smith</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your man kills a third and there'll be a bonus for you?13 Tzameti</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you desire to see an edge of your seat thriller, definitely take the opportunity to go downtown to the Market Arcade Theatre and check out the enthralling, French-language 13 Tzameti, while you still have the opportunity. This film is a debut that any veteran director would love to have included in his/her filmography. A minimalist film in terms of dialogue and set, the real magic lies in the performances. Each character has his life on the line at some point during the proceedings, whether it physically, monetarily, or emotionally. The closest film I can compare it to is the final half hour of Eli Roth's Hostel, only with tension amped up to the extreme, and the gratuity of gore and sex turned down to an almost non- entity. By showing reactions to and only short bursts of violence, director Géla Babluani has created a master-class in the school of less is more. Whereas Roth went for the outlandish, gross-out effects, Babluani sticks with reality and it is that much more effective as a result.While all the acting is top-notch in terms of expressing the weight of the world trouble laid on almost every character's shoulders, our star Sébastien, played by George Babluani, really stands out. He starts out as a young laborer, capable and taking pride in the job he is doing. His family at home really needs the money this job will soon afford, hopefully to take some pressure off his gimp brother who seems to only have time to sleep when he is not hard at work. Sébastien soon realizes that his employer is not well, mentally or financially. He overhears a conversation while working on his employer's roof that, besides fronting the advance for his construction work, the old man really doesn't have the money for anything else, and is not sure he can do the task awaiting him again. This task is given through a striped envelope containing a train ticket and paid hotel room. Circumstances soon play out which leave young Sébastien broke and in possession of said letter, whose conversations around seem to show a bountiful of wealth upon receipt. The desperate times call for him to go in his employer's place, without any knowledge of what he will have to do, in order to bring some money back to his family.George Babluani gives an emotionally draining performance, transforming from a hopeful boy with work to a broken heap of nerves, fighting for his life knowing that his only hope for survival will be to kill at least one other human being. As the film's trailer showed, the task at hand is joining an underground gambling event of Russian Roulette, with a twist. Your gun is pressed against the back of the head of the man standing next to you. When the light above turns on, everyone shoots; there can be only one victor after the three rounds and final duel. But don't look in the others' eyes; it is much harder to pull the trigger on someone whose soul is bare than the matted down, sweat drenched hair motionlessly dead ahead. These actors are battling the nerves to not only stay alive, but also deal with being a murderer in order to survive. Babluani, the director, shows us such realism that you almost believe these men have real guns in their hands, playing God while their handlers wait in the adjacent room to see if their millions have been betted on the luckiest man. The final duel is painful to watch, seeing these men resolved to tears and a need of forgiveness knowing what they will have to do.While the contest is the crux of the film, it is not the only trial needing to be overcome. We have police on the hunt for the hideout to put a stop to the games and we have handlers with novices who have never shot a gun?they must put the unknown players in because they will be fined if not, and if for some reason that person brought the police, they'd be considered the rat if they left before a raid. The stakes are high, the outcome always looking bleak. As a viewer, you have no idea where the story will take you next, no one is special and everyone's life hangs by a thread. The gorgeous black and white cinematography helps keep you on edge, viewing through sharp angles and thick grain, adding to the tension and heart- pounding action unraveling itself on screen. I almost can't wait to see the Hollywood remake, which has been recently greenlit for development, just to see how they ruin an amazing feat of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happens when fiction outstrips reality ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can one define a troublesome film like 13 Tzameti ? Can it be called an existential revelation of our modern times or is it simply a quick paced high intensity thriller ? Whatever one says,it is sure that 13 Tzameti is a rare film which makes sure that fiction comes close to reality.There is a reason for that as its director Gela Babluani learned the art of cinema from his father Temur Babluani whose film "The son of the wakeful" bagged silver bear prize for an outstanding artistic contribution at the 1993 Berlin International Film Festival.Both of them come from Georgia,a land which has given birth to such prolific film directors as Tengiz Abuladze,Temur Babluani,Goderdzi Chokheli,Georgi Daneliya,Nana Djordjadze,Lana Gogoberidze,Otar Iosseliani,Mikhail Kalatozov and Marlen Khutsiev.13 Tzameti is not for the weak hearted people as there is an excessive usage of guns in it.It is normal for us to associate guns for mutual destruction but this film shows us that they are also used to conduct wild games which can prove out to be fatal.There is a degree of authenticity as the events depicted might be taking place in an undisclosed location of an unknown country.13 Tzameti succeeds on a social level too as its success has ensured that the stigma attached to number 13 needs to be erased from people's minds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This file is highly overrated. I can only think of a few possibilities why that is. First of all this probably is due to the fact that people are more reluctant to criticize world cinema or maybe it is simply that people are misled by the file being shot in black-and-white. I really don't know. What I do know is that the script itself is not very original. Tzameti is an Intacto (which, by the way, scores lower on IMDb than Tzameti, which is a bit of a disgrace) with Deerhunter ingredients. Because these are great movies this shouldn't be much of a problem. But only when all the other ingredients compensate this lack of originality. This isn't the case. The acting performances are poor. The acting as well as the plot does show the motivation of the people in the movie who are involved in the game. While Intacto leaves you wondering if 'in the real world' one man's luck is the other man's misfortune, Tzameti leaves you with nothing at all or maybe the question 'why are these people in it?'. This is far to little for a real good movie. Furthermore the music is annoying (far too much cliché thriller stuff). The plot, especially in the beginning, is very soap like (e.g when the letter is put on the table in front of the open window the viewer already knows it will blow away and later Sebastian clumsily runs into the letter). The plot also isn't very believable (the way the police loses track of the main character on the way to the game, the gamers with loaded guns in their hands while the gamblers stand around them, the way the main character listens through the open roof to a conversation and none of the people conversating notices the open roof with the wind blowing through it). There are though a few positive points (the tension at the start of the game with the light bulb and the good acting performance of Pascal Bongard) but it is all too little to say this is a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>possibly the most tense work of fatalistic/nihilistic European cinema this year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gela Balbuani, writer and director of 13 Tzameti, has probably seen more than few Noirs from the 1950s, but his work here also makes for other comparisons as well. His film has that air of doom and detached, almost cold despair that reminds one of a Jean-Pierre Melville film. There is also the element, from Melville, of characters who 'do' more than talk, as the slightest or most obvious expressions tell everything we as the audience need to know. But the subject matter is a lot closer to that of at least a few cult films as of late that have basically a story gimmick that is taken very seriously. But unlike Fincher's the Game where the stylistic flair is part of the artificial nature of the content or Fukasaku's Battle Royal (a film I thought of a couple of times midway through this film) where the nihilism is so over the top it becomes comical, 13 Tzameti is shot in stark, gritty black and white photography. This is not simply done, I think, for the filmmaker to get in his 'old-school' kicks from those hard-boiled noirs from America and even France. The story unfolds without much complexity, but with enough ambiguity early on to make an impact midway through. Sebastien (George Balbuani in his first film role under director Gela's directorial debut), finds that his neighbor Jean-Louis (Passon, in a good if all-too-short performance) has killed himself in his own bathtub from an overdose. For a reason that is made clear though not precise (money for his immigrant family, and possibly just curiosity), he decides to follow the lead of a package of instructions left for Jean-Louis, which takes him through various channels of travel across the country even as he's being tailed by the police. Like in Eyes Wide Shut, Sebastien is the bemused, eventually awfully affected outsider, this case in a group of people who watch, bet, or participate in a sort of 'game' where rich old Frenchmen bet thousands on who will die, or kill, in three rounds where thirteen contestants have to load up one gun a piece and fire it at the other's head in a domino-type line. The game becomes the centerpiece of the film, where morphine and alcohol gets slammed down and shot up in-between the rounds, and the game itself becomes as captivating as the participants, and on both sides of the volunteer killers and on-lookers bring on an unnerving sense of doom, and it pervades the film up until the end.The logic behind the technical style, one where Meliava's absence of hand-held photography and wavering close-ups and high-angle shots in the 'shooting' scenes, creates a world devoid of a sense of humor, and one that completely sustains the tone of the film. On top of this, the musical accompaniment is only on occasion, with the mid-section The acting also corresponds with this style, as the performances are all very realistic, and Balbuani particularly has a lot to carry as the protagonist. His character halfway through goes through a change from being a not-too-special, contemplative young guy to being traumatized with this special roulette-like competition and finally into something of the walking dead in his some of his mannerisms. For a first-time performance under a first-time director, it's a turn that reminds me (speaking of French films from days gone by) of a Jean-Pierre Leaud, with a face and demeanor that can only hide so much before the emotional toll of the character finally comes through. It's an uncompromising film with a violent, desperate core where the fates are against all involved in the game, with little hope in sight. That it won't be for everyone is not a surprise, but it has an appeal that might someday make it into a cult-movie, and it's got a psychological edge that has me already ready to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carpenter Sébastien is hired by the mysterious house-owner Jean-Francois to fix his roof. When the house-owner suddenly dies, Sébastien finds a valuable letter that contains clear instructions.Géla Babluani's dark debut from modern day France about a young immigrant who takes a risky choice to help his family, opens as a classic film-noir and develops after the chronologies time-frame to a tight psychological thriller about a cynical underground milieu where the unknowing protagonist realizes that the consequences of his choice has forced him into a situation that he can only get out of by conquering death. The compassion, warmth and harmony Babluani suggests of in the character introduction is alienated after the point-of-no-return, and from here on out Géla Babluani depicts a hazardous gambling community where human worth means nothing and money everything.Promising Georgian-French director Géla Babluani was possibly inspired by 1940s American Film Noir and Robert Bresson's metaphysical dramas when he started making this formalistic art film that is associable with Juan-Carlos Fresnadillo's "Intacto" (2001). "Contestant 13" is vigorously filmed and photographed in a black-and-white color that increases the films cold realism, concentrates the plot and tones down the emotional aspects. The variations of long and short takes, the short and concise dialog and the frequent use of close ups intensifies the drama in this stylized character study, whole heartedly played by the director's debuting brother George Babluani. The misty background music and the minimal elements of humor decreases the apocalyptic mood in this tense feature film debut. This is 90 minutes in breath-taking excitement and observation of West-European art film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kafkaesque Nightmare at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"13 (Tzameti)" is a very tense, black and white France-Georgia co-production that has made people abroad catch an eye for Georgian cinema and the young filmmaker Géla Babluani.The plot is simple: a young handyman called Sébastien (George Babluani, Géla's real life brother), decides to follow instructions intended to Godon (Philippe Passon), the owner of the house he'd been repairing the roof of, after Godon dies of drug overdose. But he couldn't imagine he'd be taken to a house in the woods where men gamble on men's lives, and he's forced to take part in a gruesome game of Russian Roulette where only one of the 13 men will survive.At first, I thought Babluani's directing was cold, and Olga Legrand's performance as Mme Godon was bland. But after Sébastien gets into the house, the film develops its own momentum, a slow, edgy pace, and we are introduced to one of the most claustrophobic, original films of the past years. Many people have compared "13 (Tzameti)" to Polanski, Hitchcock, Lynch etc., and it's somewhat true, but the first names that came to my mind, undoubtedly, were Kafka and Dostoievski. Despite these clear influences, Babluani managed to make an original debut with a simple but thought-provoking plot, and a memorable ending. It's no surprise that Hollywood already signed for a remake. Won't they ever learn? Just remember the most recent catastrophe, "The Last Kiss", the silly remake of the nice Italian film "L'Ultimo Bacio", with a different, more conventional ending. See the original "13 (Tzameti)" as soon as you can, and you won't be disappointed. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant suspense film that I absolutely hated to watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film begins with a roofer working at a home of a man who seems to be a hard-core drug addict living out his final days. Several times during the first 1/3 of the film the guy looks like death warmed over and eventually he does die from an overdose. Just before he dies, a letter arrives that somehow means the potential for BIG money--but exactly what it is and how he was to have earned it is unclear. The roofer, on a lark, steals the letter. Later, it turns out there are instructions for where to go as well as a train ticket--but what this big money-making opportunity is is never clear--though you can safely assume it will be dangerous and illegal. After all, why else would anyone offer a dying addict this opportunity?! I really don't want to say more, but this film is amazingly intelligent in its writing but will most likely turn the stomachs or cause very negative reactions in many viewers. Be advised that you may want to bow out midway through the film--that's okay. Too bad the roofer couldn't.As Ricky Ricardo was fond of saying to Lucy "You got some 'splaining to do" when it comes to my summary. How could the movie earn an 8 and yet be a film I hated watching?! On the surface, this doesn't make any sense. Well here's why--I don't particularly like violent movies and this is one of the most violent and upsetting films I have seen in a long, long time. Now the violence isn't like a John Woo or Sylvester Stallone film--where you have tons of explosions and gunfire. Instead, it's very up close and very personal--and frankly this made it very disturbing. By comparison, it was much more disturbing and difficult to watch than SWEENEY TODD. Exactly how and why it was so disturbing I really don't want to say, as it really would hinder the suspense--just take my word for it that this is NOT a film for kids or even teens to watch and most adults would also flinch at the extreme violence. Now this isn't to say it was gratuitous--the film makers used black and white film and really underplayed the blood but it still made be turn my head from time to time--but the violence was still THAT intense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film's creator is too in love with it's (rightfully so) brilliant idea to take care of the rest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fascinating debut of bold new filmmaker Géla Babluani is a provocative, concept-driven idea, dealt frightening precision and tension, but falters heavily with introducing and concluding the grim scenario. If you do not have any knowledge of what this situation deals with, please do not seek out any plot details, as it will only make the journey the main character (younger brother George Babluani) undergoes all the more amazing. Rest assured that it is not very pretty with soft intent, but has the potential to be extremely gripping with it's loud concepts. It still remains clear that the film relies too heavily on it's uncompromising centerpiece while negating many other aspects to distinguish itself as total accomplishment. While oozing a little too much self-conscious cool, the acceptable but never remarkable acting does not take hold until the contrived and trivial setup plays itself out. It is only when Babluani's brutally simple, starkly poetic themes presents itself during the brief film's midsection that the justification behind winning an illustrious grand jury prize at Sundance begins to make sense. Here, this young director hits a gallant stride, creating some of the most uniquely tense and introspective action sequencing in a while. It is a breath of fresh, nihilistic air, as compelling in metaphor for artsy intellectuals as it is engaging in literal form for adventurous action fans. Unfortunately, intense effort afforded the brilliant execution of these sequences vastly undermines the thinly constructed story that was supposed to give this more weight, ultimately proving distracting in an otherwise riveting middle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would've been better as a short film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good but somewhat disappointing with very very little storyline. Basically, from the teaser trailer which just showed a scene from the part in the movie where they play the "game", I could make up this entire film. Besides the main concept, there is nothing new or original in the movie which was disappointing. We don't get to know any of the characters, and the game gets repetitive when they add nothing new to change it up. They also throw in a storyline with the police to try to put some meat on the storyline but it doesn't do much. On the flipside, this movie is quite well-filmed and despite its severe (and I really mean that) lack of tension, it still remained somewhat intriguing all the way through, with a very bleak atmosphere enhanced by the stark black and white look of the film. The first part up to the game worked well and would've worked even better had I known nothing about this movie. Essentially, I think this could've been one of the best 15-20 minute short films I'd ever seen. Instead, it is a diluted/flawed but passable feature film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brotherly love at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a love story, a dark and morose love story. Its about the lengths that one brother will go to in order to deliver the other from a life of drudgery and uncertainty. A small deviation from honesty is answered with an introduction into a world of pain and suffering for the principal character. Blood sport is a realm of the lowest common denominator, for those whose lives have left them bereft of common decency. So they gamble on the misfortune of others in as intimate a manner as possible. I knew what was coming as the story evolved, yet it disappointed and saddened me nonetheless when the curtain closed. The tension that mounts in the movie is extreme. If you like a straight forward game of chance, you'll like this movie. Dark in the classic film noir style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mind blowing nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sundance Film Festival World Dramatic Winner. French film by a director from Georgia. Apparently remade by Hollywood as "13" within the past few years. For the first half I was left wondering what exactly the heck is happening? And why is this in black and white? The B&amp;W had no dramatic effect on the nothing that was taking place. Slowly everything comes into view as our protagonist sets off on a mysterious journey with the promise of money at the end of the rainbow. Only there is no rainbow. The black and white cinematography helps move this dark thriller as we enter a world that can barely be explained with words. It's a mind-blowing (pun intended) nightmare. Rich men will bet on anything and this has got to be seen to be believed. Sitting in shock and awe, the film progresses swiftly to its ultimate conclusion leaving me wondering if what I truly just saw was truly on my screen or a nightmare of my own. Definitely an excellent directorial debut that I'd like to see again someday.7.0 / 10--Zoooma, a Kat Pirate Screener</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Shocking Tale to The Last Shot!! Wonderful!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: 13 TzametiDirector: Gela Babluani Review: 13 Tzameti is a film that is either a masterpiece or a violent, disgusting tale. To me this film is both: a modern violent masterpiece by an unknown director, Géla Babluani, who came out of nowhere and made his violent debut with this film. A film with a low budget like this once again proves that we do not need Avatar like budget to make you like a film. Surprisingly, this film was a lot better than Avatar for its exciting plot and its valuable dialog that you become attached to in the first few minutes of the film. The entire film was shot in Black And White and you might be thinking, "Who the hell does that?" but the director made his reasons clear as the first gun shot went off. What I mean is that the color for this particular film made the experience a lot more....more...splendid. I cannot visualize this in color. When 13, Géla Babluani's remake of 13 Tzameti comes out in cinemas around the world, then we can compare each one but my hopes are stuck onto this one. The beginning starts out really boring as you see a roof repairer repairing a building. Then things start to get more interesting when he is requested to help a woman carry her friend who is a morphine addict into the house. From then on, it's a ride to hell and mainly, fun. The atmosphere is what I call perfect in this film because it creates something that suits the film and also adds a bit more effect to the deaths. Some people might be thinking that is a Russian roulette based film but no it isn't but instead it is a French Roulette where they all stand in a circle with a gun to each other's head. Since this film is quite short then this review has to be, sadly, short as well. Sebastian, a young man, has decided to follow instructions intended for someone else, without knowing where they will take him. Something else he does not know is that Gerard Dorez, a cop on a knife-edge, is tailing him. When he reaches his destination, Sebastian falls into a degenerate, clandestine world of mental chaos behind closed doors in which men gamble on the lives of others men.A low-budget film like this will draw away most people but don't fall for that and make sure that this is in your hands no matter what you are feeling. Who cares if you are the odd one out in the whole video store because you would get the most pleasure out of viewing this. I would like to say, again, that Gela Babluani is a talented director who actually creates shocking miracles. I cannot wait to compare this film with its remake, 13 with Hollywood actors. The first shot was unexpected and really frightening. The deaths were so real that you wish you could tear your eyes off the screen but couldn't since this film gets you in a hypnotic trance. I highly recommend this masterpiece to people who love the genre (s) like Crime, Thriller, and Drama, or a mixture of all. 13 Tzameti is the year's best foreign film, maybe the decades, for its brilliant story and a great cast all worthy of praise. George Babluani plays the role if innocent to not so innocent Sebastian well. He lacks acting skills but has a lot of expression. The ending is different from what you have in mind but it is sad as well. If you liked this movie I also recommend....mmmmm....oh, I forgot this film is unique........... 8/10</fullReview>

Just watch him shaking and facial expression in the first scene. He made the scenes so believable that reached the realism to another level.I had no expectation from this movie, neither did I visited IMDb b4 watching it nor did I know its genre. Maybe that why I got such shocked. Story: Good and innovative. Direction: Very good but a few things are overlooked like a spy is using a tele-lens to click some photos but has his flash open, now what was he trying to lighten up?? ;-DPace becomes slow at the end but accepted... Highly recommended to all thriller lovers. Thrill and shock are the only things that this movie has to offer you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this is a simple story of behind-the scenes crime and gambling, it required above average acting for it to work. The actors do not disappoint. While the lead actor is excellent, just about everyone including the "brothers", the master of "ceremonies", bring out multiple facets of the characters in an unbelievably watchable way.The tension and relief are quite visible on most faces on consequent occasions - but the tension and relief are different for the different characters. This was the challenge for the actors and they have excelled.In order to truly appreciate the movie, one must be 1. mature. 2. able to imagine oneself as the different characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Le Fight Club</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young man steals a mysterious invitation to an opportunity to make some money in Gela Babluani's film '13 Tzameti'; and the movie begins as a tense thriller, with grotesque and blackly comic overtones. But the film's start does little to prepare the viewer for what is to come, as the hero joins a secret society that resembles less the world of 'Fight Club' than the climactic scenes of 'The Deer Hunter'. The film provides no wider societal explanation for the behaviour it depicts, although in terms of immediate psychology, it's wholly compelling. And also wholly horrible, in an age where every barbarity is regularly shown on screen, there's a riveting awfulness to the unfolding nightmare, in a sense, this is a film about the meaning of life in it's most unvarnished form. A fresh, brilliant and utterly uncomforting movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well i've seen this movie three times now and thought about sharing my view on this movie. "13 tzameti" as the name suggests makes you taking guesses on what the movie is all about, starts well as the story develops and the viewer is left with so many questions as something happens every minute or so. finally when all the questions are answered it turns out to be more intense and thrilling as my palms get sweaty every time i see it.This movie is quite a experience, a guy follows the instructions meant for someone else in pursuit of money and end up getting trapped in a dirty game of murder. The idea of making it in black &amp; white is perfect as the impact would've been different if made it in color. well the movie is recommended for everyone who wants to experience something different like never before.</fullReview>

I don't want to give much away, so I'll just say this is a great movie that can satisfy and entertain both the artsy cinemaphile/movie buff and the casual viewer (with a functioning brain). It's a black and white nightmare you never know when or how will end. You can feel the tension rising as the story unfolds. You can hear the heavy breathing. You can smell the blood. And most of all you pay attention - you care about what happens on screen.Admittedly the main character could have been developed a little more, but see this movie for what it is, a very good debut featuring brilliant cinematography, acting and plot. Interesting and well-suited music as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"One down, one to go, just another bullet in the chamber", as Alice Cooper once put it. That pretty much wraps up the second half of "Tzameti", writer-director Géla Babluani's first full length feature. Sebastian doesn't talk much as he goes about his business as a low-end handyman in the bleak French coastal town of Deauville. Until one day the devil deals him a fateful hand. The train ticket and travel instructions he snatches from a dead man's mailbox hold the promise of instant wealth, but he really has no idea what he is getting into. He goes from no-name roofer to high-profile lab rat in no time, but the games these people play make the high rollers' whims in "Rat Race" seem like little more than child's play. The high-contrast footage Babluani uses may be black-and-white, but his movie's soul is black all over. It has a a very archaic feel, partly due to the actors' restrained performances, partly due to the eerie piano music performed mid-contest by one of the players. Watch out for Vania Vilers in the part of Schlöndorff and Philippe Passon as Godon. He dies a few minutes into the movie, but you feel his presence all the way to the bitter end. Raw material, don't take the kids. As you read this, the movie is being remade, by the same director, with big money brought in by Brad Pitt (who may also appear in the remake).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 2005 French movie by the Georgian director Géla Babluani may be the blockbuster of the next year. Yet it will be a remake by the same director, so if you want to see the pure original better watch this one. Hollywood spoils many good ideas borrowed from other cinema green fields in the process of remaking.Yet, it is exactly the originality that is lacking here. The story is quite mind-blowing - a Georgian worker fixing a roof on a French seashore town gets hold of a ticket to hell when the owner of the house suddenly dies and he takes his place. He finds soon himself involved in a cruel real-life Russian roulette betting competition where the losers lose their lives while the winner takes some money and his life ... maybe.Polanski, Tarantino, Borges, Fight Club, Deer Hunter, all have been mentioned with respect to inspiring this movie, and all is true. Symbolism of numbers is the only more original addition. Actually the strongest influence is the one of the French noir cinema to which this film owns its cinema and style. It may not be too original, but it's a spicy and intriguing dark melting pot.</fullReview>

However, here, these ideas are played out fully, and completely, and nothing is left behind.13 TZAMETI is a wonderful little film, completely made in black/white. This puts the spotlight on the characters and the story, instead of using special effects and/or other horror or tension gripping tricks.The movie is very well played with some superb performances. The direction and script is splendid. The movie is very subtle, but sometimes right on the spot.I like that it plays out as a Hitchkock drama, mixed with tension taken from a Gaspar Noé-film - even though 13 TZAMETI never shows graphic gore in the same way.This is a very very well made movie that I bet many people will enjoy. It is scary and portraits a horrific world - but it is a very very good movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree, Babluiani did not invent thrillers. Thus, some might say he is not original. Granted, Old Alfred would be our idol forever.However, this director knows how to play with the genre. First of all,this movie is perfect technically. I don't remember when was the last time that I saw a movie that did not need more editing. Be ready for a very independent,non-Hollywood film( why, why does he make a remake in English? Do we have to sell everything?) It is based on some tradition of Georgian movies ( we like playing intellectuals ) but also cultured by French ideas, Existentionalism leading the parade. If you like action movies, you will not enjoy it; If you like work well done, you will marvel at the perfection of the camera,music,acting, etc;If you just like watching weird movies, you will want to hug the director and beg him for more. I appreciated the plot.Since you do not know a lot about characters, you have to catch their personality in minor details ( like sad facial expression of hero's mother or his affection towards his sister, it is shown for just a split of a second). I like the main character and I believe he looks wonderful in B/W. I didn't give 10 because I rarely give 10 to movies.Plus I am afraid to be subjective,since I am Georgian myself.However, I highly recommend it to independent movie lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak and depressing and pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This moody little French film has, at its core, a good commercial idea but for me, the manner in which it is told is all wrong. Shot in gloomy black-and-white (presumably to add to the bleakness of the tale rather than economic necessity because surely black-and-white film must be more expensive to process than colour these days) the film struggles to get the viewer on the side of the young protagonist and therefore struggles to develop the element of suspense it needs to be a success.A roofer working on a beach-side house, finds an envelope containing a train ticket and hotel room number lost by his employer, who has just overdosed on heroin. Learning that he won't get paid as a result, and having previously overheard the dead guy say he was waiting for the envelope because he would earn a lot of money from it, our young hero decides to find out where the train ticket will lead him. After following a convoluted set of instructions he discovers he has stumbled into a nightmarish situation from which there is only one possibility of escape.I won't go into too much detail about the tournament that our hero chances upon, but I'm pretty sure that was the single image in the writer's head when he started writing and that everything else developed around that central idea of thirteen men in a room. If I'm right, that might go some way to explaining why I felt so uninvolved with what was going on. Although it's a good half-hour (at least) before anything really happens, little attempt seems to have been made to allow us to get to know the (nominal) hero, and his reasons for pursuing a potentially perilous mission just don't ring true.Everything is very low-key and downbeat, a technique which really should heighten the tension and the horror of the situation, but which just leaves everything feeling flat. The young guy in the lead is fairly convincing and plays his part well, and there are some wonderfully weather-beaten faces on display throughout, but everything seems a little bit, well, pointless ? with no message imparted and an unnecessarily depressing ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At times during the film, I was thinking of movies by Roman Polanski ('Repulsion', 'Le locataire'), because of similarities in style. But, in the films by him that I know, Polanski has more to say. Actually, I'm not sure what this film ís saying. The premise is as far fetched as one can get it, which is the main obstacle. Beyond that, it is hardly anything more than a brutal drama, without much substance - although it starts out pretty strong.George Babluani does a good job, though, as do most of the actors. The style - all black and white - is very nice and well executed (no pun intended), and the soundtrack is quite atmospheric. It all works, except for the basic premise and the thin dramatic themes... And who really enjoys watching a game like that for such a long time? I'm in a bind there. I could of course try to think of what mankind is capable of, or imagine how this is on some level metaphoric, but it doesn't help much.5 out of 10, without wanting to dwell on it any further.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>13 Tzameti is a Georgian film which deals with a Georgian emigrant named Sebastien who takes a roofing job to help out his poor family. After his employer's death(before paying him), he steals a letter which his employer received which included a train ticket. He does this with the hope that this ticket will lead him to a scope of making big bucks as he had overheard his employer speaking along those lines about this letter. But unfortunately following the trail of the letter makes him step into a world of utter horror where he ends up having to participate in a deadly game of Russian roulette where gamblers bet on the outcome.There are aspects of the film which are very impressive, but there are also huge chunks of the film which are very underwhelming. Let's first talk about the things that I liked. The actual scenes of volunteers taking part in the Russian roulette are extremely well directed. The director brilliantly creates and maintains the tension in the scenes. The sheer horror and the hopelessness that the protagonist experiences during these games after being forced into them made me sit on the edge of my seat and got my adrenaline rushing. I think '13 Tzameti' shares a thematic resemblance with the David Lynch classic 'Blue Velvet'. In both the films, the naive protagonist unknowingly walks into an alien, dark underworld which leads to horrifying consequences. While Jeffrey in 'Blue Velvet' steps into this world due to his unrestricted curiosity, Sebastien in '13 Tzameti' steps into the darkness due to financial needs and his responsibility towards his family engulfed by poverty. However there are a lot of things in the film that disappointed me. The writing in the script is weak. The characters are all two dimensional. We get no insight into their lives. We get no back-story. The actor playing the protagonist(Sebastien) has no presence and his acting skills are clearly inadequate. We see random characters appear and then become completely absent for the rest of the film. Although the direction in the roulette scenes are good, however in all the other scenes the direction is pretty lacklustre and bland. After watching the film, it is clear to me that Géla Babluani is great at directing set pieces, but below average at handling character moments and character developments. So, I think while writing the script, he primarily prioritised the set pieces in the Roulette scenes and just threw in some random characters and events around it to make up the film. I am giving this a generous 6, but it certainly left me underwhelmed big time, specially since I was expecting it to be remarkable based on the critical reception. It does have impressive moments in it, but it could have been so much better with better writing and direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Filmed in widescreen black-and-white, this dark and harrowing film conveys the look of film noir combined with the bleak existentialist sentiments found in so many Eastern European works. "13 Tzameti" is a stylish thriller that is difficult to describe without giving too much away in a review. A deceptive first half ticks slowly by as the pieces fall into place. Sébastien (Georges Babluani) leads an impoverished life constantly struggling to support his immigrant family. While repairing the roof of a neighbor's house, he overhears a conversation about a forthcoming package which promises to make the household rich. Sensing the opportunity of a lifetime, Sébastien intercepts the package which contains a series of veiled instructions. Following the cryptic clues, he assumes a false identity and manages to slip through the grasp of the encroaching police as he ventures deeper towards the unknown. The closer he gets to his destination, the less he understands. Ultimately, he comes face to face with a perverse ring of gamblers placing bets on a depraved game of chance where the spoils are unimaginable millions, and the losses are counted in lives. Directed by Gela Babluani, "13 Tzameti" is a winner-take-all thriller where a naive young man is transformed into Player 13 in game with only one way out. Babluani turns this cryptic game of cat and mouse into a running nightmare of cold-blooded tension. Georgian-born director Babluani works like a prize fighter, distracting attention with one hand before slamming home with the other, and the clinical black and white photography only adds to the nightmare. Once the game is revealed, however, drama is sacrificed for pure tension. But although the outcome is never in any doubt, the twist in this nasty little tale is anything but a cheap shot. If you're in the mood for chilling suspense, place your bet on "13 Tzameti."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always have a fascination for films which are the debut of a director. Plus this film is a nice thriller which is watchable at least once. The film has nothing that special. The story is good but not something innovative. However it is different from what I was seeing recently. The two parts of the film looked to be a lot different and by the time you have finished the film, you will barely have a memory of the first part. This is the major flaw that I think was present for me. Otherwise the film does steal the show in the second part. The acting of the main lead looks dull at some times but then his innocent face manages to save his part. Well when you have a different story to see than acting hardly matters. The way they built up the tension was good and the role of the person organizing the event was the best for me. Even though the film does not offer anything new, it has a sense of refreshment may be owing to the innocent face of the lead actor.MESSAGE: "Destiny is supreme."VERDICT: "A recommended watch once."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A predictable movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched 13 Tzameti because a friend recommended to me and except the ending, everything in this film was predictable. The protagonist win all round of Russian roulette, it was pretty clear as he doesn't will die. The ending catch up the predictable things though. Few shots give some headaches, i think it has been shot with a digital camera (when he go buy food at the end, or when he talk with his family at beginning). It's the first movie of the director so it's understandable. Excluding all negative points, i liked as the protagonist is Georgian, really rare to see this nationality on movies and sure, the black and white style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A perspiring first film. A pale-faced Georges plays a builder who, whether from boredom or bravado, assumes the identity of a deceased client, plunging into an adventure whose outcome he cannot guess. It begins like a Simenon tale, in a quiet seaside location, yet becomes a twisted fairy tale in the depths of a wood. What unravels there should be beyond belief, but such is Babluani's grip on events, and so ominous is the black-and-white photography, that what might have seemed a nasty contrivance comes across as a calm investigation of fate.That calmness -- and the work of both Babluani brothers is weirdly stilled and mature, already devoid of the need to show off -- serves only to thicken the horror.Caution, please do not watch movie '13' which is English dub of this movie. It misses everything that this movie offers. Why Babluani had to do that i don't and will never understand. By making that movie he depreciated the class of this subtle plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sebastien(George Babluani) is working as a roofer at the house of a drug addict who has hired him for repairs. The homeowner soon dies of an overdose and Sebastien has overheard him discussing a mysterious money making opportunity. He finds a train ticket and hotel reservation and uses them to pursue his dream of easy riches. Of course it all goes from bad to worse when Sebastien drifts into an underground, illegal and dangerous gambling operation.The dark and ominous tone is beautifully photographed in black and white, a very wise choice for this highly stylized French drama. It starts slowly but the tension builds gradually and your patience will be rewarded by staying with this gritty and sad observation of human nature. The violence is low key but riveting and unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Silver Inferno</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gela Babluani, who at just 26 years old already knows more about suspense than many filmmakers absorb in whole careers, creates a fear so profound, a nightmare so believable that its talons rip into your perception. 13 Tzameti is elegantly minimal, and remarkably hard-hitting, and its monochromatic look at a cast of captivating, case-hardened mugs make it unbearable not to watch, even when proceedings grow nigh on unbearable.Georges Babluani, indeed the director's brother, plays young Georgian immigrant worker Sébastien, who is living in France and working construction jobs to sustain his destitute family. Working on the home of a man named Godon, he learns that he's a frail morphine addict, and is under police surveillance. Godon's overdose turns all of Sebastien's toiling into a waste, so when he overhears the widow furtively discussing an enigmatic "job" meant for her husband, desperate Sébastien filches the instructions for obtaining the mysterious position. The instructions are a crafty manner of evading the police. Sebastien is about to wish he didn't follow those instructions.Establishing himself with a muted eye and a smart ear, Gela has fashioned a film in three acts and while his exposition is intriguing and location striking, it's the innermost act that is laden with taut pressure, an astounding set piece that will hold spellbound any moviegoer willing to give it a chance. The composure in the work of both Babluani brothers is uncannily subdued and ripe, already free of the urge to show off, and works no more than to congeal the terror. Dialogue is short and curt, personalities deferential to plot, character names of such irrelevance that most do not in fact have evident ones while others are distinguished by purpose or by numbers on clammy T-shirts, or by a broken nose, a cane-aided hobble, an unpleasant gastrointestinal issue or a bespectacled slightness. And one would be negligent not to note the exceptionally good suspense thriller score by The Troublemakers, piano, flute and cymbals flitting about a Middle Eastern theme.The film's minimalism and force are ministered to by the bracing black-and-white cinematography of Tariel Meliava, which gives the work a noir look suggestive of the 1940s but with a ferment that is utterly new millennium. Indeed, this beautiful testosterone nightmare is a film thick with distinctive male faces, skillfully composed in black and white close-ups, like Diane Arbus subjects. We do get momentary sensations of character from some of these supporting players, like Aurélien Recoing's brutal Jacky and Vania Vilers' untamed Mr. Schlondorff. Also vibrant are men who back them, like Sébastien's sponsor Alain, all cultured cravat and tweed jacket, and a frenzied, panting gambler who would've been a Peter Lorre character in noir's halcyon days. Less a character than a device, Pascal Bongard is indelible as a delirious master of ceremonies, and helps power the anxiety with his roared announcements.Unlike so many low-budget debuts, 13 Tzameti is filled with genuine behavior on screen. The performances are all active and dynamic rather than static, sensory and specific instead of general. It's made on a shoestring by a bare-knuckle beginner, and it's a smart, austere film noir where men either have little hope or so much money it has warped their souls, though that is no reading of the film. It's purely experiential, which is why it's so effective. It has no superficial moralizing, and that detachment, with the underpinning of restrained formality in enterprising technique, makes for a gripping film to say the least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>13 Tzameti is a thriller that neither thrills, nor provides even an averagely satisfying motion picture experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is surprisingly, and unexpectedly a bore. This French thriller not only packs no punch, it has almost negligible suspense, except for a couple of scenes which are just mildly suspenseful. Less than ninety minutes, 13 Tzameti may be one of the slowest ninety I've ever spent my life on. The film takes way too long to get viewers into the mood, in fact it becomes alive only after passing the halfway mark.While the 'Russian Roulette' theme is significantly disturbing, the violence is not as shocking as I thought it would be. It's intelligently shot in black-and-white (a rare sight these days), but I wonder how much better the film would have fared from a cleverer, and unpredictable script. The cast shows little chemistry, and most of them are sleeping pills personified. But they are not to be blamed, the badly-written screenplay offers no room for the actors to work their talents. In a nutshell, 13 Tzameti is a thriller that neither thrills, nor provides even an averagely satisfying motion picture experience.GRADE: C- (5.5/10 or 2.5 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com]All rights reserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where, in the game of life, live only those who are game?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fundamental requirement for a good story is that it's believable. Get past that hurdle, and viewers will forgive many, perhaps most other aspects of the film. Even movies with complete unknown actors ? as in this, 13 Tzameti ? suffer nothing, provided there is a believable story. The stark B/W photography works brilliantly, especially for this viewer, evoking murky and sinister plots of yester-year: Reservoir Dogs (1992) and The Asphalt Jungle (1950) come to mind ? other exercises in men who get in too deep for their own good...And 13 Tzameti is exclusively about men; and what they do; with and to each other, in secret; for money.So, the plot begins development of that idea as we meet a young handy-man type worker who, quite by chance ? a gust of wind, in fact ? stumbles upon an opportunity to lift himself out of grinding poverty and "make a bundle", as many like to say; almost like a gift-horse, so to speak. The catch, for the young man, Sebastian (George Babluani) is this: he doesn't know what the "job" is; nor does he know anything about what he's getting into when he uses the train ticket he finds in the envelope brought to him by that fateful wind.Hence, there is a relatively long, but crucial, setup before Sebastian gets on that train ? a bit more than the usual twenty minutes I like to allow before I begin to squirm in my seat. This story is worth the wait, however. Because what he discovers and what he experiences is akin to the worst kind of horror you ever can imagine: like a nightmare from which you just cannot awaken ? something most of us have experienced in our worst nights of delirium.Bring that into the light of day and you then stay riveted to your seat, your gaze glued to the screen, the tension within your body rising as the suspense builds almost unbearably while the utterly gruesome events of this story inexorably unfold as they must. Only that consummate horror writer, the late Roald Dahl, with some of his outstandingly unbearable stories, comes close to what the viewer sees ? and can't take eyes off ? in this film. In that regard, the horror contained in Audition (1999), a film I have reviewed here, is an apt comparison.Don't be repelled by my use of 'gruesome': overall, there is very little graphic violence from this first-time director. He directs and uses the camera so well, he leaves it mostly up to your own mind to make it all the worse for you. Others might point to some of the clichéd camera angles used as worthy of criticism; no worse than Tarantino's, in my opinion.What is truly repellent, though, are the characters that Sebastien meets and with whom he must deal. Arguably, even the good guys are bad ? just not quite as bad as the totally degenerate bunch that dominates this story. And, this bunch of actors is picture and word perfect for their roles.Sebasten is only twenty-two; and growing up is hard to do, as we all know. So, it's fitting, I think, that this story can also be taken as an allegory for the journey we all make through life ? never knowing, from one day to the next, what lies ahead. But, we press on, hoping, always hoping that things will turn out okay?that dreams can come true. Well, today is that next day for Sebastien.Wouldn't you like to join him as he moves bravely forward, eyes wide shut, into the unknown?Highly recommended - but not for the faint-hearted.</fullReview>

I cannot recommend this film enough.Those of you interested in checking it out should be sure to hit the special features for an absolutely hilarious little short film entitled Sunday's Game. It was a witty little gore-fest featuring a group of adorable little old ladies gossiping, sipping tea and playing an ultra bloody game of Russian Roulette! Brains and doilies never looked so good! If you're thirsting for something new and different and you're able to watch black and white films with subtitling than look no further than 13 Tzameti. I know many people out there don't do B&amp;W nor are they fond of subtitles but I highly recommend giving this film a shot. I don't think you'll disappointed with this fantastic bit of French / Russian cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To some degree, everyone understands that there are universes that run parallel to the more-or-less civilized reality in which most of us go about our daily affairs and that these parallel universes are often as near to us as the other side of a car door. Parallel realities in which various laws or social norms are ignored and in which everyone's general health and well-being aren't necessarily the top priority.And while the shock value of '13 Tzameti' will depend on any given viewer's understanding of the sharp difference in sensibility that will so often characterize the inhabitants of these alternate worlds, newcomer Géla Babluani's second film is nonetheless a compelling parable about the other side of the car door.It is rather a precipitous plunge into just such a parallel universe by a young French handyman that is chronicled in this picture's evenly-paced 93 minutes runtime. The handyman, Sébastien, is making repairs to a beach-front home in France that is owned by a man of some means who has just returned from a trip. But something is wrong: The man is in a state of near total exhaustion. The police are watching the mailbox and the owner's wife is fit to be tied. The only clue as to the man's considerable distress is a letter that arrives before the police can intercept it and which ends up in Sébastien's hands. In it, cash is promised to the recipient for following mysterious instructions requiring travel by train. When Sébastien's fee is jeopardized by the chaos, he endeavors to prove he is the world's stupidest Frenchman by pretending to be the intended recipient and following the instructions himself.Without giving away the form Sébastien's nightmare actually takes in the film, suffice it to say that it is stark indeed.A warped sense of accountability came to define the world of Enron's top officers when that company imploded.Al Capone's parallel universe of speak-easies can be described as one in which Prohibition didn't matter.In '13 Tzameti,' we encounter a culture of behavior more typical of the Roman Empire ? one in which human frailty has become a matter for sport.And like the makers of 'The Blair Witch Project,' and 'The Deer Hunter,' what Babluani knows about the horror of stories like these is not the physical peril itself, but its embrace by the weakened and beaten minds that could once have been allied against it. That's what really gets your skin to crawling: collaboration.The French Resistance shaved the heads of Nazi collaborators after World War II and it is fitting that in this French film, the question of collaboration, ultimately, elevates the theme above one of a mere "ain't this awful?" Will Sébastien be a shaver or a shav-ee? A question made all the more important as we learn in the film's DVD release that the story is rooted in real-life accounts of actual events.Shot entirely in black and white, '13 Tzameti' occasionally feels like the graphic novel Frank Miller might have authored had he grown some sense for nuance: The more intense a scene gets, the higher the contrast. At its best, the effect is one of universality -- at worst, an unpolished amateurism.The director's young brother, George Babluani, plays Sébastien and this conceit could have cost the film its authenticity. Despite an expressive face that conveys an interesting mix of intensity and innocence, the younger Babluani is out-acted in nearly every scene that counts and especially by the more experienced Aurélien Recoing who has over 100 films to his credit. Perhaps it is by virtue of the fact that George is playing an inexperienced outsider in this story that he gets away with the performance he provides.Ultimately, what '13 Tzameti' does best is what so many good independent films do and that is to consider topics and themes that go unexamined in the mainstream market.At the very least, after watching this movie, you will think twice about which car doors in life you decide to open.This movie review by Erik Gloor</fullReview>

The protagonist, an immigrant twenty year old guy, struggles to survive and works fixing a roof, when the owner of the house he's working at dies of overdose he gets to know that he's not going to be paid and decides to replace the man in a mysterious job outside town. He finds himself involved in a whirl of violence that will take away from him any form of innocence.Yes that's it and that's all you should know about this unusual movie. Here in Sydney Australia it had been plastered over our little screen the whole week prior being screened as a kind of trailer, I paid little attention to it as I was not to keen in what I saw through the occasional glimpse. Instinctively I had dismissed it as not being "my cup of tea" So when my wife told me there was a french movie late on the night I made an effort to watch it (this about my only contact with my natural tongue beside the 50 minutes french news that are available 6 times a week!). Little I knew it was THAT movie! Never mind about the "cup of tea" I ended up making a strong cup of coffee! I hope just like me you'd dive into it without knowing much about it as this is the power of any thriller, isn't it!. I'm a little sadden to hear that US will do their version of it and in colour (the way I spell colour reflect my feelings (weel beside Australian spelling ha ha ha).

		<shortDescription>An Unsuspecting Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When starting off this film seems to be a normal French film. We first see Sebastian with his poverty stricken family and his mundane job as a roofer. While this seems to be a normal French drama, it soon takes a disturbing turn into a fascinating thriller. This film grabs and holds on to you, causing a heart stopping reaction throughout the film.This is one of the best thrill rides that I have experienced, and the filming style adds to this thriller. While the film is modern it is shot in black and white, and does not diminish the experience, but actually enhances it. This film is not about the blood and gore, but about a story that shocks you to the core.Every twist and turn in this film is done with such finesse and none of it seems unnatural. While in an extraordinary situation this film portrays it as a normal occurrence, which makes this film that much more disturbing. There is nothing special about Sebastian, if anything he is just your average Joe, but he is forced into a very terrifying world. This adds to the film because if an ordinary person like Sebastian can get caught in the situation that takes place, what is stopping it from happening from the rest of us. Another part of this film that entrances you is the sound track. While waiting for the light to turn on you hear nothing, which makes it that more terrifying. There is no use of violins to exaggerate the tension. The tension is there on its own, and by not adding a musical score to these scenes it makes them that more real and thus more terrifying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a thriller comprised of three parts. The main character is introduced in the first part; it's here he acquires a ticket to escape the poverty of his daily life. In the second part the ticket proves to be a one way journey to a high stakes game of Russian roulette where the only way to survive is to play the game. The aftermath of the game makes up the third part of the film.The bulk of the film is really the game of Russian roulette, and it's terrifying to watch. The game is both systematic and vicious in nature, and yet mesmerizing to see played out.The film is shot in black and white which provides a bit of a visual buffer from the gruesome consequences of the game. Yet, B&amp;W adds to the suspense and tension of the film in a way that color couldn't. The use of B&amp;W also heightens the contrast between the film's portrayals of rich &amp; poor and life &amp; death.The acting is believable and overall the film is well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"13 Tzameti" follows Sebastien -played capably by George Babluani- as he struggles to find work in a small town. He gets a job roofing the house of a drug addict who has the misfortune of overdosing before Sebastien can finish, and subsequently paid. Luckily for Sebastien, before the drug addict dies he overhears him talking about a big money making job opportunity on the horizon. Sebastien comes into possession of the train ticket needed to get to the job, and decides to go down the rabbit hole. Unfortunately for Sebastien, he doesn't find a Wonderland, in fact quite the opposite. Before he knows what's going on he's in way over his head in a sinister world that he could never have known existed.A French language film shot entirely in black and white, "13 Tzameti" is a skillfully captured film that is devoted to telling its twisted story. Director Gela Babluani (brother to star George) and cinematographer Tariel Meliava do not try to do too much with the camera, and succeed at developing extreme tension on screen without having gallons of blood or using other oft used thriller/horror movie surprises. It is pragmatic storytelling all the way here, and it is very effective. In fact, the audience feels that it is part of the story as details are revealed to us at the same time as Sebastien. As a result, "13 Tzameti" frequently has the look and feel of a documentary because of this technique.The acting in "13 Tzameti" is extremely consistent, and sometimes very good indeed. George Babluani does a fine job as Sebastien while Philippe Passon delivers a very good (if abbreviated) performance as the drug addict whose death perpetuates the entire story. Pascal Bongard and Aurelien Recoing also give entertaining performances during the meat of the film.13 Tzameti is a simple, but highly effective thriller that is a fine debut from director Gela Babluani. I look forward to watching more films from this clearly talented director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that any member of the audience implying himself in 13 Tzameti won't feel but sheer horror as the grotesque competition takes shape; it's impressive the solidness Babluani achieves in erecting this dreadful fright of a divertimento, turning what could be felt as burdens into the roots of its impact - the goofs of the police investigation subplot framing the movie's development enhancing Sebastien's experiences as the only valid testimony of the a game turning Battle Royale into a hopscotch, the lack of any minimally lucid motivation to imply oneself into such a homicidal spiral the absolutely horrified Sébastien will survive just for being finally flattened by a tragic chance impressing much of the film's strength; and one could feel that the Tzameti (a number symbolizing in Georgian culture an ambivalence of good and bad luck) rules relentlessly the film's course by sealing Sébastien's fate. In this sense, I find 13 Tzameti an admirably driven film.13 Tzameti is not an enjoyable, but a revulsive film, and excepting the gorgeously shot first forty five minutes I couldn't feel engaged by its dynamic. But it would be terribly unfair repudiating a so intelligently raised movie because of that... all in sum, '13 Tzameti' is a very promising opera prima by a young filmmaker which seems to have much to say and knows how to give it an overwhelming relief.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The less you know about this extraordinary existential thriller the better. If, like me, you are seeing the film 'blind', so to speak, it will blow you away. Reviewing it is problematic since any mention of the plot is almost to give too much away. It's best you find out gradually what is happening in the same way the central character does. Suffice to say, this is a highly original work and it's genuinely terrifying; a one-off, it heralds a brilliant new talent in Gela Babluani who both wrote and directed, (his brother George is the lead so it's something of a family affair).Superbly shot in widescreen black and white by Tariel Meliava, the film has the texture of a nightmare. It certainly scared me a lot more than the last half dozen stalk-and-slash movies I'd seen. Of course a Hollywood remake is already in the pipeline. Normally I would advise you not to give it the time of the day except for the fact that the powers that be have had the common sense to hire Babluani to remake his own film. Hopefully he won't sell out but I doubt very much if he will improve on this stunning original.</fullReview>

It also marks the acting debut of his younger brother Georges Babluani, who plays the film's protagonist Sébastien. An American remake of the film is in the works, however Babluani intends to "change a lot of the storyline" and avoid reshooting the original film. He has also indicated that he intends to shoot the remake in color (Screening at the University of Notre Dame, 23 Feb 2007). The film will star Mickey Rourke, Ray Winstone, Jason Statham, Sam Riley, 50 Cent and Ray Liotta.

		<shortDescription>A great movie ruined by a terrible ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I touched a gun, it was late into my teen years. I remember when and where. Entrusted to my care was a shotgun. The gun weighed on my shoulder and arms. Squeezing the trigger brought the desired effect, but for the life of me, I never did hit a single clay disc. As the skeet sailed by over and over again, I struggled to concentrate on the target and not the power I held in my hands. Little has changed since that day. I am still a blind shot, yet I'd like to think I've more respect for a firearm.In the film 13 Tzameti, it is hard to tell if Sébastian (Georges Babluani) has touched a gun before joining a game in which a requirement is putting a gun to the head of the man standing beside him and pulling the trigger. It's hard to gauge what kind of man Sébastian is in general. He doesn't say much and nearly every bit of information to be gleaned about his character must be drawn from his actions. It isn't hard to see, however, that 13 Tzameti is about the power of violence. There's no moaning about or philosophical waxings by the characters. The content is in the visuals not the dialogue.And the visuals are stunning. It's hard to rave about the beauty of a movie that is preoccupied with the nature of violence, but oddly, it's appropriate to 13 Tzameti. It's photographed in black and white which seems to heighten the tension. Without color, violence is reduced to a stark game of survival. It's primal. It's raw. 13 Tzameti is not interested in muddying its waters with too much visual or spoken information.Instead, we, the viewers, are plunged into violence at its most basic level; therefore, the question 13 Tzameti wishes to singularly ask is "What is the effect of violence on a man?"?or put another way, "How does violence change a man?" Great war movies such as Full Metal Jacket or (the 1930 film version of) All Quiet on the Western Front try to do this but generally sidetrack such questions with dogmatism: The war movie is interested in the morality of war itself and brings the effects of violence into play only to strengthen its arguments.Since 13 Tzameti has no dog in the hunt in respects to the merits of war, we are generally spared any debate of ideology. Since there is no debate, only "the act" itself remains, the act of putting a gun to another man's head and pulling the trigger without reason, there is only one way we can react. "This is absurd!" Since the rightness of the actions on screen are not in doubt, all we are interested in is how Sébastian reacts to the "game" into which he has been led.Much praise is required for Georges Babluani. 13 Tzameti is not a piece of thriller hackwork singularly because of him. Babluani is controlled in his acting. He never gives too much away by crying hysterically, moping, gesticulating wildly, or breaking into monologue. When he tries to run away from the violence, he does so without panic. When he cannot initially bring himself to pull the trigger, he refuses to sensationalize the moment.I have only one major complaint with 13 Tzameti; however, it undoes what has come before. It breaks down in the third act. This is a common complaint among movies. A great premise is broken by an unfocused conclusion. Since the major question 13 Tzameti is asking is "How does violence change a man?", the only reasonable conclusion should answer, or attempt to answer, that question. 13 Tzameti does not even attempt it. In the final moments, an unbelievable coincidence beats the viewer about the head with the absurdity of violence. It's clear the director is not sure that we've picked up on this yet. The inclusion of such a silly and unconvincing coincidence by this point in the movie would be funny if it wasn't so sad that it ruins an otherwise great movie. Only a dunce would have missed the absurdity of the violence in the movie. Why do we need to be told so obviously? I left the movie feeling cheated. I had been cheated out of ultimately seeing the long term effects of the violence on the main character, and for that, it is impossible for me to say that this movie is anything other than interesting. It's not a good film and certainly not a great film. It is simply interesting, interesting to wonder what could have been and interesting to see an excellent acting performance by Babluani.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lucky Number 13?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A clever premise that depicts what can happen to anyone who decides to probe into waters that shouldn't be swum. 13 TZAMETI is a taut, edge-of-your-seat thriller that is as bleak as LES ARMEE DES SOMBRES (ARMY OF SHADOWS) while dealing with completely different subject matters. Like Hitchcock, Gela Babulani commences his film in a rather straightforward, somewhat slow and even aimless fashion and shows us what seems to be a day in the life of his young 20-something hero who is working on the rooftop of a house while underneath him, something sinister is simmering, literally, underneath his feet and bubbling to get out. A ticket, intended for someone else, finds itself into his curious hands, and since he has nothing better to do, he decides to go along with wherever this may take him, unaware of two worlds about to collide around him: that of a police surveillance, and an underworld society that plays Russian Roulette with human lives. Forty minutes into the movie, the plot tenses up to eleven and never lets up -- there are moments when the suspense is so great something must give, and Babulani certainly plays his thrills to the hilt. However, when it seems like it is going to direct the viewer into familiar territory, it has some gruesome surprises along the way. It's a riveting must-watch shot in gorgeous, shadowy black and white with a great performance by the young Georges Babulani as the Everyman caught in a trap he should have avoided in the first place.</fullReview>

This is not the best movie i have seen, but the style and the story of the movie are quite unique.If i have to compare it with one movie it's with "C'est arrivé pr?s de chez vous" by Rémy Belvaux. The same dry humor with the morbid situations. And the acting is indeed very good, you can live in the situations of the main character. conclusion : Check this out.

		<shortDescription>Proper Hard-Core</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A day ago I came across this movie on DVD. It was black and white and in French, so I said "oh, what the hell?" I had never heard of it, but thought it looked like a proper hardcore movie to keep me on the edge for a couple of hours. It begins by introducing the main character and his family's state of poverty. Having successfully thrown you into a world of misery it justifies later on the choice of the main character to go along with a game of Russian roulette he has stumbled upon on a desperate search of money (though it's not really much of a choice).It's got strong images and elements (like the light-bulb signal) and being shot in black and white it enhances the harsh feeling of this film. It gives you the information you need for the characters' motives and makes you believe that this could actually be happening somewhere in the world. Especially enjoyed the acting of the instructor of the death game. If you like corrupted, filthy-rich men wasting their money just to see poor people die , then also try watching "Hostel".To sum up, it's a straight story, without any attempts to be clever or profound and it shows just how much a life is worth, without being preachy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oddly enough, the trailer for 13 (Tzameti) gives away the major surprise of the entire film. Avoid the trailer if you intend on seeing the movie.13 (Tzameti) is a devastating thriller shot in gritty black and white, and presented in ultra-wide screen. The look vaguely reminded me of Jules Dassin's RIFIFI.A 22-year-old roof repairer discovers an envelope containing a train ticket and a letter confirming a hotel reservation. Originally addressed to his recently-deceased employer, the young man knows that this is his ticket to a potentially large amount of cash. He takes the train, having no idea what wild adventure awaits him.I won't divulge anymore of the story. But, let's just say, what awaits him is psychologically, and ethically nerve-wracking. Few films have frayed my nerves to the point of no return, as this movie has.It's purely a plot-driven movie. (Might I note - director Babluani has already 'sold out' to Hollywood - and is slated to remake this film in English for a 2008 release. He was obviously aiming for a commercial film.) The characters are not very deep. However, there is a raw, documentary feel, heightened by the fact that most people in this film are NOT professional actors. (For example, the male lead is the director's younger brother.) As in a Mickey Spillane novel, the audience receives information ONLY on a need-to-know basis. We are never let in on any irrelevant details. Each scene acts as a cliffhanger, holding your attention, hooking you in for the next scene. It's a thriller with that rare quality of speeding freight-train inertia from beginning to the end (i.e. there are no slow spots.) The 'game' which the young man is 'requested' to play, while perhaps in the realm of fiction, follows a set of strict rules. The protocol has clearly been time-tested by experience. (At least it feels that way!) Any time a film-maker attempts to present the audience with an original experience, or whole new slice of culture, I admire the attempt. While driven solely by plot, 13 (Tzameti) spends enough time with various characters, that each has an opportunity to create a unique impression upon the audience. Yes, the script moves, it's tight, but loose enough to allow the actors to be themselves, to demonstrate idiosyncrasies. This creates a fly-on-the-wall documentary feel. This gritty realism, for my money, qualifies the movie as one of the great thrillers of this decade.Hard to believe this is Babluani's debut feature!Note: Very squeamish people may find the 'game' utterly revolting to the point where they deem 13 (Tzameti) to be just plain sick. By no means is this film life-affirming. (It's extremely existential in it's outlook.) Quentin Tarantino could serve as a good litmus test on whether you would find 13 (Tzameti) revolting. In my opinion, RESERVOIR DOGS is more inhumane than this movie. PULP FICTION is perhaps a bit tamer, or equal in squeamish-inducing-intensity, to this film. Either way, be prepared to be uncomfortable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>French Noir- a dark tale of a wrong turn on the path to adventure. Includes handsome french hero and mystery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fantastic french "film noir" that tells a macabre story in a framework that is visually interesting. This is black and white and the dramatic film work with the intriguing scenes and the eerie movie score create an immersive captivating tension. This feels like an old movie but it is not constrained by old standards in telling its' dark tale.This is a story of a young french roofer who, by unusual chance has an opportunity to take an unknown fork in the road at a point in his life where he feels he has nothing to lose. He thinks he should try his luck on whatever well paying mystery job is on the other end of this unknown opportunity. Mysterious well paying adventure beckons and he responds.Sometimes when you take that fork you realize how much indeed you have to lose that was previously taken for granted and this is what we focus on in this story and it is well told and very dark.I found this captivating but people with no appreciation for older noir movies or the french language -this is in FRENCH w subtitles- will be thinking that there is not enough CGI action sequences or breasts and there are no explosions either.This movie reminded me of a good Hitchcock story through a french noir filter.When I watched this I kept saying to myself, now THIS is a movie! Old school mystery and many things left to the imagination for a really good suspense.Don't watch this with someone stupid, they will continually interrupt the tension of the flick. This is best watched alone or with someone that knows how to shut up to get the proper suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good idea. Badly translated to screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main idea is certainly very good (even thought I was expecting it no to be as straightforward as it is once revealed), but that's about it. If you are French speaking, you can enjoy the bad acting (I think most of the movie is dubbed). If you have eyes and ears you can notice the bad lighting and sound design. The editing is between average and OK. The story itself is very predictable. On a weird way, the artistic choice of black and white keeps the movie from being categorized as 'shot for video'. Anyway, I guess it was made with a zero budget and it is not such a bad start for a director. But, as I saw the movie on DVD a while after the buzz created around the theatre release, I must admit I am deeply disappointed. For once, if there is a US remake planned, I would be very interested to see it.</fullReview>

But before that, you get to learn the main character, so that you will care for him. All through the nail biting scenes, that will occur later.

		<fullReview>Why is this movie a dud? -bad acting: Aside from some moody brooding, none of the players can emote. Some of the notable performances: the heroin addict, who comes off as a cranky Hugh Hefner in need of some shampoo; his wife, whose emotional repertoire begins and ends with 'annoyed'; the lead, who sleepwalks through the film, whose only depth comes from the addition of sweat stains on his tee shirt, the dumb cop, who delivers his lines like someone reading off of cue cards behind the camera (&amp; why did he park his vw bug literally right in front of the main entrance to the house he is watching, come on, where is the 'AAA Plumbing' stake-out van?)...there's a lot more but I don't want this review to be a spoiler. The one bright spot is the ringer for David Lynch with his wacky hair.-bad story: the story is utterly laughable. I don't mind implausibility or the occasional plot hole, but this stinker is just over the top. None of the characters has any kind motivation, and the basic premise just dose not work.-bad direction-There is nothing interesting or worthwhile in the ham-fisted way this film was shot. It looks rushed and low-budget, and maybe it was.I am not sure why there are so many positive comments. I suppose if a film is in black and white and comes from France, some people think it HAS to be artistic. This film just goes to show that the french film industry makes crap just like the American one.I see Brad Pitt's company has bought the rights to this thing. It will be kind of interesting to see how H-wood handles this story.cheers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless shocker: a shameful waste of time and money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally, I am very choosy when it comes to movies ? I do not watch pieces of which 12 are a dozen and that is all we can say about them ?, and that is with a reason. But this time I was not cautious enough. 13 Tzameti (which is one more than a dozen) aroused my attention merely by its title. Then, it started to play in my favourite movie theater, and that was when I did not question its predicted values. Well, I should have been more careful, because I was in for a great load of disappointment.13 Tzameti is one of a kind, no question about that. But it is the most pointless, dullest piece of trash I have seen for a long time. I really cannot write much about it without giving away the plot. It tries to be utterly pure like some of Antonioni's or Claude Chabrol's movies, or from more recent times, those of Francoise Ozon, but ends up a meaningless waste of celluloid, time and money. It lacks a well-established context and is violent beyond comprehension. It is l'art pour l'art violence, there is no point in it, no intrinsic moral lesson, nothing. Even the worst thrillers and action flicks have some aspiration to convey some message, even if they fail to do so. They have a few twists and turns and a feeble attempt to entertain or to deter, but 13 Tzameti offers nothing. Director Géla Babluani thought it was going to be very stylish and artistic to shoot in good old black and white anyway, but it is rather pretentious instead. Outrageously so.Sometimes negative criticism can be a good omen, but not in this case. Censorship can never be justified, but if you go watch this one you will wonder how it made it to movie theaters. Would my home-made pseudo-artistic shocker I shot with a 16mm I bought at the dime store also make it? Believe me, it is a fairly justifiable question here. But you do not want me to ask it for real, do you?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When 13 Tzameti hit our screens it quickly be a favourite on the festival circuit, winning awards at Sundance and Venice. This obviously creates a buzz around a movie.Sebastian (George Babluani) was a 22-year-old construction worker whom employer (Olga Legrand) dies of a morphine overdose and his wife was unable to pay him. Sebastian finds instructions meant for his employer, so following them. They take him to the Parisian underworld where he is forced into a lethal game of Russian Routine.13 Tzameti was Géla Babluani's first film as a director and there is promise. He is stylist, using black and white cinematography to get effort. With moments with long phases there is a tense atmosphere during the Russian Routine scenes. The story itself was straightforward and Gela Babluani did focus on his characters. He recruited a strong cast, including his brother and their performances were not just with the dialogue, but with the face expressions and physical performance. You can feel the fear in the characters.But 13 Tzameti is far from being a perfect film. Some elements of the plot was predictable and you could easily guess who were going to face up to each other. The other major problem was the pacing at times was a bit too slow, particularly at the beginning. It needed to be speeded up.The best part of the film was the Russian Routine scenes. Gela Babluani is a director with serious potential.</fullReview>

Filming it in black and white enhances the mood and feelings of a cold, bleak place. The superb acting of the young protagonist almost exceeds the mystery and anticipation of what is about to happen. The bleakness of his life and environment help to understand his action. His lack of options once he sets off on his quest is tormenting. Knowing his circumstances makes one wonder what led the other players to this place.I can think of no other film that made me so physically and mentally tense. Perhaps Hitchcock's "Psycho" but that film had moments of tension, 13 is a film of total unrelenting tension.</fullReview>

The fantastic black and white cinematography (which brings to mind the superbly shot b&amp;w semi-mockumentary, MAN BITES DOG) is must-see for those of us whose tastes run to the higher end. This one reaches out, pulls you in, embraces you- then unflinchingly delivers the goods (think STRAW DOGS). The turn of events is surprising enough (I tend not to look too closely at the cover art, for fear I'll find something that'll tip the filmmaker's hand), but it's the ever low-key unfolding of same that makes this one so good. There is no compromise on the part of the filmmakers. One can't ask for more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd heard good things about this French thriller, so I went in with relatively high hopes. My hopes weren't exactly met, but this film certainly represents a success for the French film industry and I for one certainly don't regret watching it. The film is shot in black and white, which is most definitely a good thing as it excellently compliments the bleak and oppressive tone of the film. The film works from a good premise - albeit one that doesn't have a lot of point, and 13 (Tzameti) is more an exercise in style than one of substance. The film focuses on Sébastien, a young man who makes the silly decision of following instructions from a phone call meant for somebody else. Without his knowledge, he is being tailed by a tough French copper, and after doing what the mysterious guy on the phone told him to - he finds himself in a bleak and very dangerous place where you're life isn't worth a thing and immoral men stand to make a lot of money.The film gets off to a slow start, but it livens up quite a bit once the plot starts to reveal itself. The main highlight of the film for me was the way that it presents a gloomy situation in the most pessimistic way possible. Director Géla Babluani certainly has an eye for visuals, and many scenes in the film - the main pivotal one for example - are likely to stick in the memory. It all comes back down to the lack of a point, however, and that definitely hinders the film. You could attribute a few ideas to the film - things such as 'don't follow instructions meant for someone else', but this sort of thing doesn't hold much weight. Don't get me wrong - I don't require every film I watch to have a point (far from it, in fact), but when a feel looks and feels deep like this one does, it's hugely disappointing when you can't scrape a bit of substance together. Overall, 13 (Tzameti) is definitely worth watching - the visuals are great and the story is interesting, but given the reaction it's got so far - the word 'overrated' springs to mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great concept - though not completely original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film all about the middle. The first 35 mins are boring and frankly are motivated by nothing except to make the middle section slightly plausible. As such the first section comes across as wooden and unbelievable. The ending was predictable, and I didn't care for it much but it didn't take anything away from the film. However the middle act is extremely good. The roulette scenes are handled beautifully by a director who succeeds in maintaining tension and tone. The acting is great and shows a subtlety which helps to support the tone of the film which is always teetering on the edge of falling into the absurd.One thing that was very poor about this film was the use of black and white photography. It came across as nothing but pretentious and is a cheap device to create that cinematic film and tension - It add's to the power of the film but ultimately comes across as amateur and undermines the whole piece. If the director could have kept the same tension in the roulette and middle sections in colour photography then it would have made the scenes all the more impressive.Be warned though, this is a purely concept film. No characterisation. No engaging dialogue, It's all about the middle roulette sections - so if you're part of the art house crowd and interested in seeing this film then keep that in mind. The beginning and end are forgettable and as such I cant help but think this would have been better as a short film, in fact it feels like a great little short with inconsequential beginning and end tacked on to get it widespread theatrical release and DVD sales. But ultimately this is a vehicle for the young director and it has got him attention in Hollywood, so it certainly has worked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"13 Tzameti" (2005) is a neo-noir, filmed in black and white. A young man is unwittingly trapped into a deadly game, basically multiple Russian roulette that involves 13 players, that's the object of betting. The film is executed very well. The question is this: What is it about? I have not read the opinions or reviews of anyone else, so I'll offer my own reflections of how it comes across to me.It's neo-noir through and through because its world is an underworld peopled by desperate men who play a game that either nets them a lot of money or death. There's no in-between. Those who arrange and bet on this game are living in a world bereft of conventional morality. Furthermore, the protagonist (George Babluani) is in a trap from which there is no escape. Even a win doesn't remove the dangers ahead of him. The world depicted is amoral, bleak and dangerous. Survival is mostly a matter of chance. Even when Babluani uses his wits to elude pursuit and to evade being arrested by the cops, he is still faced with further danger. His wits only extend so far, up to a point. He faces the ultimate leveler that we all face, which is death.The gambling game being played is a zero-sum game. All it does is redistribute wealth. The survival end of it is luck. Survivors do not stay alive by any skill whatsoever. It's totally a matter of chance. The gambling likewise takes no skill, although the players or some of them still operate on hunches and beliefs that they can predict what's random.The closed world depicted in the story is basically unproductive and merciless. No one shows any grief or pity for the victims who die. The men create their own hell and live in it.</fullReview>

Since I didn't have any money on the table myself, this game of Russian roulette was only mildly interesting. Think FIGHT CLUB with live ammunition, only without the wit, appealing performances or the multi-folded approach. That kind of thing, only misery. On tension, the film delivers. When after a slowly unfolding first third, the Russian roulette game starts, it's undeniably tense, but it's mostly an exercise in horror. Lost of violence - if not too explicitly shown on screen - but wallowing in a kind of hollow depravity, it makes for incredibly depressing material. The film belongs more in the slowly emerging category of the art-house horrorfilm, primarily the domain of French and Belgian (Walloon) filmmakers. When watching a group of men holding guns to each other's heads, it's not that difficult to fuel the senses with some anxiety, but there's little else on offer here. The film's resolution holds little surprises and we're exactly where we started. Nothing new here, just nastiness.Camera Obscura --- 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deliciously clever, 13 (Tzameti) is a dark and powerful tale of one mans story to help support his family. Shot in black and white for an ultra noir look, 13 captures elements from varying formats of action, drama and Hitchcockian thrillers, and roles it up into one unforgettably satisfying tale.It's brilliance lies, not in its ability to produce turns at every angle but for us as an audience to sympathise with our protagonist, and more importantly feel every bit of anxiety and tension that he himself is experiencing. The tension derives from a powerful performance wher our protagonist is brought to the point of tears as he engages in this unpleasant "game". Not because he is afraid of dieing, but because he is afraid of "having" to kill someone. He is a noble character of Shakespearean proportions, and it is this, not twists and pointless turns which make 13 a unique cinematic experience which defines, or rather reminds us, of the true art of film making and viewing.However, the film is none too formulaic. Whilst some elements may feel as if they have been viewed elsewhere, the manner via which they are used and implemented allows them to feel fresh and genuinely involving. In hindsight one would have to summarise that the cleverest moment in the film resides in its first thirty seconds of live-action, i'm sure on a second viewing it will make sense, but I come out of the film feeling as if i've just been truly smacked around the face by a big red herring.13 is cinema at its most rewarding, a film where we become emotionally involved. The "grim" (although they're not overly to be frank) sequences do not detract from the plot, nor do they, like in other films, provide relief, they only accentuate the harshness in the story. We become immersed in our protagonists, Sebastian, world, and while the first thirty minutes may seem slow for sequences of plot development, some may say painfully slow, pieces slowly begin clicking into place and then once the ride begins it is captivating and utterly engrossing.While ostensibly nothing more than a straight forward film about Russian roulette, 13 defies viewers and critics and proves to be a film of sustainable worth. A mans love for his family is an over riding theme, but equally this can be derived from social commentaries about immigrants and minimum wage. However nothing ever detracts from the main storyline, and with a possible Hollywood remake (insert HUGE groans and expletives here) on its way, spin the chamber raggedy man, lock, load and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure exercise in tension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've skimmed other reviews I must say then, that it has nothing to do with Hostel. At all. It's not Tarantino's style either, no brilliant lengthy dialogs here. It's a pure exercise in film noir style, and this exercise is about tension. One thing I may agree is that it is somewhat close to Hitchcock's style with creating tension in the minds of viewers, not on the screen. And sure it bears the marks of both Georgian and French cinematography schools as well.The concept is as simple as a group of men playing Russian roulette. This is it, no gore (amendment of color stripped the remainders of it) or sadism (no coercion) mentioned here. The idea lays in between the rounds (or bullets) of the game. In something, what other film-makers skip. What players feel, how does it feel to be there. No morals drawn, no lessons or points - it's film noir. Just photography and, of course, your feelings about what you see. I've heard my heartbeats between shots, so if you up to this exercise, you may probably hear yours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was the point ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't get this movie. Obviously it had some sort of meaning, but all I got out of it was the typical artsy movie existentialism of "life is grim , woe is us" which is perhaps the most overdone film device in film history, and if it isn't, it's definitely in the top five.The problem with this film is that we never get to know any of the characters or understand their motivations beyond what is etched out for us on the screen because the dialog is so minimal and the acting so subdued. The plot follows a young roofer who, after his latest customer drops dead of a drug overdose depriving the roofer of his payment for the roofing job, decides to steal a letter from the recently deceased customer which supposedly offers a well-paying job. The roofer follows the instructions in the letter and quickly finds himself in a situation over his head and beyond his control. I don't want to spoil the surprise, so all I'll say is that the situation the protagonist becomes involved in is an extreme test of body, mind and spirit.The acting was fine, the cinematography was great, the story was compelling, and the minimalistic dialog was suitable, but the sum of the parts is lacking. At the conclusion, I wondered why this movie was made because, although it was entertaining, it wasn't that entertaining, and although it may have made some points about life, death and relationships, the themes weren't that significant. All in all, I can't say that there is any reason to watch this movie unless you like existentialist Fench movies shot in black and white. Otherwise, you're far better off with Pirates of the Caribbean or similarly-themed motion pictures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dark and dreary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an awful movie, if this site had a zero rating that's what I would give this one. A totally pointless and unrealistic story, uninteresting characters(in fact no character development at all), dark and dreary setting with dark and dreary music with dark and dreary people. All in all a dark and dreary movie. I did not like the way the secondary characters in the first part of the movie just drop out of the storyline to be replaced by other secondary characters with no explanation. The ending of this film is as dark and dreary as the rest of it, fitting I guess given the overall tone of the film. If you're going to make a movie of this sort at least make the lead character someone to care about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great idea, poor screenplay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great idea doesn't make a great film. And that is exactly the problem with 13 Tzameti. The, obviously talented, writer - director rests assure on his great idea and doesn't bother for more. He doesn't develop a descent plot and delivers a film that is really interesting for only 30 min or so. Because after that, nothing new happens. The surprises end and along with them the interest of the viewer. And it's really a pity, because the story has so much potential that could have been evolved to a really great movie. I would write more but i don't want to spoil the viewing for those who haven't seen the film yet. All i can say is that 13 Tzameti is an interesting film but highly overrated. A great chance for an unforgettable experience that was missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unoriginal, Unbelievable but good editing and cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sebastain (George Babluani) is a 22 year old builder working on an alcoholic gangster's house. When the alcoholic drops dead he decides to take up the opportunity of riches by following a set of instructions he finds in the house intended for the dead man. This leads him to a dark and disturbing world where human life is highly expendable.The film form(i.e editing, cinematography mise etc) was excellent and the use of black and white film gave it an eerie quality. However, the story was completely over the top and highly unbelievable (unlike the scene in Deer Hunter which this has ripped the idea from) therefore I was totally unable to suspend my disbelief whilst watching it.Surely there are'nt people in 'real life' who would sacrifice their reputations, their lives, their freedom and standing in society to attend such grotesque betting events as punters. Moreover, would they really have felt safe standing in a room full of men with partially loaded guns which could be turned on them at any time? In addition, surely Sebastian would not have been so cool, calm and collected in this situation, I am sure the majority of people would have point blank (excuse the pun) refused to take part, vomited, screamed, shouted and done anything to avoid doing that even if it meant a nasty punishment. Also, why did the main rival to Sebastian really think that he was invincible when the odds were so stacked against him. There are no special skills you can acquire which will provide you with longevity and thus riches, its a game of chance and all they can do is pull the trigger and hope for the best.To conclude, nice techniques, film was shot well etc , but the story was ridiculously unrealistic and in the end predictable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See it NOW</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not much time to write this, so forgive any errors and SPOILERS. This is a great movie. Go and see it. Forget King Kong or Match P*int or any of the nonsense stinking up the place. Thirteen is genuinely unnerving, incredibly tense and very well made. At times the wide-screen B&amp;W close-ups recall '50s and '60s French cinema, in a good way. The atmosphere goes from murky and confused to all-too-clear with chilling precision. It is very nerve-wracking. It is very good. What are you waiting for? Go! Now! Turns out I have to write more than this as I have not reached my minumum quota. What else to say? Performances? Excellent. Photography? Excellent. Music? Excellent. Why are you still here? Go and find your nearest cinema showing this masterpiece and buy a ticket. It is the kind of film that works best on a big screen, so make the effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneventful, unoriginal rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie yesterday only knowing that it had something to do with Russian Roulette. I came to the conclusion after watching the film that it is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I didn't expect a face off style action flick or anything but my God, nothing really happened for the first half an hour and there was very little characterisation. On the plus side it is tastefully shot and is quite well directed, however, how much this was due to the black and white aspect making me feel like it was more high brow than it was, I'm not sure. The attraction of this film is clearly the violence and tension of the Russian roulette scenes, the fact that human life can be so easily discarded, and that men are willing to lay down their lives for money in a game of chance. However we do not get the impression that the main character is worth saving. He is not really put in context and I cannot see a rational human being (which he appears to be) realising he has got himself into a Russian roulette competition and continuing to stay, no matter how much money is involved. The Russian roulette scenes are very tense, the faceless room and stark light bulb adding to the tension. But it is blatantly obvious that our 'hero' is going to survive the game which completely ruins the tension. Furthermore I found myself wanting him to die so that the film would be over sooner. All the filming outside of the roulette seemed to be a waste of time as we get to know no one except the main character. I won't spoil the end of the film but needless to say you see it coming a mile off. All in all this film was predictable, incredibly dull, and did nothing new. You could, as others seem to have done, try and intellectualise this movie but it really isn't worthy of that sort of analysis. The controversial theme of the film will be enough to carry it despite it being rubbish. A guy plays Russian roulette and wins, big deal. Dull, dull, dull!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Georgian director , Great Georgian film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>hey everybody says that it is a French film, yeah it was taken in France, produced by French producers, but look, director is Georgian, the son of the great Georgian director Temur Babluani, and the leading actor is also Georgian, director Gela Babluani's brother George Babluani. and in the film credits there is written: Georgia/France.OK, we have figured out that. Another thing I want to say is that, this film has very original screenplay, great music, performance is also nice. Director shows his skills in achieving high temperature in the film. so, I suggest everyone to watch that film, satisfaction is guaranteed. I can say that this film is another masterpiece from Georgian directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>visually sweet, morally bitter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes the cinematography is beautiful, so is the leading man and technically this is a very well made film. However, good craftsmanship cannot override subject matter. This film is grotesque in the extreme, many people walked out of the theatre i saw this in after the first round of roulette and in retrospect, i wish i had because the audience is only submitted to endure further the sick mind of the director. I have never before thought a film to deserve its rating on the grounds that film tend to be graded conservatively, but as as a 15, this is just not a fair indicator of what the audience can expect.What is the message of Tsameti? Does Sebastian deserve death for meddling in the affairs of the man who committed suicide without paying him? Then again, does he really have any other option after what he has experienced-is death his only option? Some films show such a glamorised version of life that after, one can feel that their own does not compare. This film's virtue is that Tsameti is the complete opposite of this, the relief is marked upon leaving the cinema and remembering that life is usually not quite so horrific as it is portrayed here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I want my 2 hours back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is possibly the most pointless film I have ever seen and certainly one of the worst. We never get to know or care about the main character, there is no plot to speak of and the dialogue is flat and bland.I will give credit in saying that the acting was good and there was a fair amount of tension. The sharp monochrome photography was also good, as was the editing. But to what end was all of this talent put? A pointless farrago, the main subject of which was much better handled in THE DEER HUNTER and it was only a tiny element in that film. When I watch a movie, I require something to make the time worthwhile like story, character development or spectacle but the most interesting character here seemed to be the Police Inspector and he only had about two scenes.You may ask: Why do I say I want my 2 hours back when the film only lasted 1 1/2 hours? The answer is I want extra time for compensation reasons. There are those who think that this is a good film. Then again there are also those who think that a pile of faeces in the Tate Gallery is art. Let's hope that the next film from this apparently talented young director will be a vast improvement.</fullReview>
