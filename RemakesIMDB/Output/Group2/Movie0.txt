		<fullReview>I really don't understand how movies like this get made. Step one, half ass a cast together of "big names" and provide a silly premise.Step two, give someone top billing even though their role is the lesser part of 5 minutes.Step three, find a rapper that has no talent so that your culturally bereft urban youth have a reason to see the movie.Step four,rely upon arty cinematography as the culturalification of the movie, legitimizing that its no better than a bottom shelf rental.Alright, get the idea? movies these days suck, no wonder I won't pay to see one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, if you could handle Tzameti 13 you'll be sorely disappointed in 13.This Hollywood "rehash" resembles more closely, the Hostel series but with more jump scares, or "Saw", but with guns.Jason Stratham, Ray Winstone, Mickey Rourke, and David Zayas are wasted and merely have what amounts to brief cameos among a cast of unknowns who do little to move the story along. Sadly, it wasn't the thriller or mind-f*&amp;% film audiences would have hoped for. When the movie is over, it leaves you with a feeling as you just had a meal that wasn't satisfying. Some parts of the dialog were so bad that it made me wince. I had to back it up a bit to see if they actually said what I thought they said and it was even more painful to watch the second time.I rented it from a Redbox DVD dispensing machine and I still want my dollar back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Preposterous in a bad way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about an underground "game". It a game of pure random chance. You have a 78% chance of being killed, 17% chance of surviving, and 5% chance of walking out with a little under two million dollars.Rich people dress up in tuxedos, act all high-class, and bet on which participant will win. The bookies offer odds. How can they offer odds on a game of pure random chance? It doesn't make sense. It's a dumb excuse for voyeuristic sadism.Jason Stretham enters his brother into the game three times in a row, giving him a 99% chance of dying. Why would the brother do this? Why would Stretham? Why would he act all surprised when his brother dies? Okay, so the plot is particularly stupid. The characters in it are preposterous. Also the pacing is ponderous. This film has no redeeming qualities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gambling Can Be The Death Of You!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Georgian writer Géla Babluani found such success in his film 13 Tzameti n 2005 that he decided to recreated the story, this time placing it in the United States. Co-writing this version with Gregory Pruss is the only aspect of this adaptation he shared. The story is a tough one to watch, not unlike 'Fight Club', but with higher stakes. It share how far gambling men will go to get their thrills, making cock fights seem very tame. The game at hand is based on gathering quasi-desperate men (prisoners, men deeply in debt, criminals who have little to lose, etc), placing them in a room with tee shirts bearing numbers, giving them guns, placing them in a circle, and on the command of the master of ceremonies they are to fire their gun into the head of the person in front of them. A smarmy form of Russian roulette, at first each man's gun has one bullet in the chamber, but as the game goes on more bullets are placed and the game continues until there is one man left alive. The gamblers place bets on the various numbered men and the stakes are high. This process is performed in a isolated meeting space and is closely scrutinized by detectives who seek to uncover the scheme and stop it.Vince (Sam M. Riley of 'Control' and 'Brighton Rock') is a young electrician whose father has been in an accident resulting in sever injuries that require multiple surgeries. Vince's family must put their house up for sale to pay the expenses unless Vince can find a quicker way to make big money to pay the hospital and surgeons. Quite by accident while doing an electrical job he over hears the house owner discuss a 'job' that promises to pay a lot of money. The man plans on doing the job, receives an envelope with instructions, but then shoots up heroin and dies of an overdose. Vince helps the police who investigate, but before leaving the house Vince takes the envelope that contains instructions and a cell phone and a piece of bark with the number 13 printed on it. Vince follows the instructions and ends up in a complex scheme - the ultimate result of which is the fact that he becomes #13 in the gambling game. Others sequestered for the killer game include Mickey Rourke, Ray Winstone, and among those involved in the offensive debacle are Alexander Skarsgard, Ben Gazzara, and emcee Michael Shannon. The ending of the film is a complete surprise and revealing even part of it would ruin the impact of the film.This is definitely not a film for the fainthearted. That such a gruesome gambling scheme could exist is terrifying. But the production and the acting and the grisly atmosphere is well worth the moviegoer's attention. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what Géla Babluani was thinking. 13 Tzameti was a cool movie made on a shoestring budget and was ingratiating in its presentation. This newer version is completely watered down, soft around the edges, and bereft of all the charm of the original. Everything from the wide angle tracking shots to the roofing opposed to electricity (the whole in the roof was a nice device), the death in the bath as opposed to the chair, the globe hiding spot, the little sister of the protagonist in the original had a more authentic cuteness about her than the WASPY mainstream girl in this one. The protagonist steals the papers instead of finding them outside. All the minor differences favor the original. Surprisingly, even the acting was much better in the original, despite being paid a fraction of this all-star cast. The main reason I wanted to see the remake was because of the cast, but it was a total let-down.The original was good, but it was good to the point where it was a cool idea and they were able to make it with the budget they had and it worked. It wasn't so brilliant that it deserved a big money remake which in fact hurt the credibility of the film, and in my opinion, the reputation of the director. He had his breakthrough movie, and then he could have followed up with a similarly creative idea. He may have ruined his career with this terrible remake.All in all this movie just seemed incredibly lazy and it didn't seem like anyone working on the movie cared about the final product. Rourke is entertaining as always, but you can tell it's just another shtick role for him, nobody was making much of an effort here. As a viewer I felt like I was investing more energy into watching it than anybody put into making it, so i started to doze about halfway through.Skip this movie, it's just not worth your time. Life is too short. If you haven't seen this, then watch the original. But if you have seen this, I think the original is spoilt for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but enjoyable remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot: Bewildered young man stumbles into a tense game of chance when he impetuously steals a dead man's invitation.I really liked the original French movie, though I found it to be a little pretentious. The American remake excises all of the art house elements in favor of big name actors, a curiously extended back story for Mickey Rourke's character, and some really bizarre (but awesome) acting from Michael Shannon. The original French version was also a bit more bleak and nihilist, which I think was watered down for American version. Despite this, I've seen several people complain that this movie was too bleak and nihilist! Wow. I guess some people were expecting a traditional, by-the-numbers thriller with car chases and shoot-outs rather than a pensive, darker drama. Unfortunately, a lot of the tension was also streamlined out this version, though I might be misjudging because I already knew the plot. Still, the brutality and nihilism of the original, made all the starker by the black and white stock, really stuck with me, and I didn't feel as though I had quite the same experience when watching the remake.I'm not one of those snobs who thinks that the original movie is always better than the remake, but, in this case, I think it's true. If I hadn't seen the original and liked it so much, I'd probably rate this a bit higher. Judged on its own merits, I think this is an enjoyable movie, but it doesn't live up to the original. For a movie billed as a thriller, it's lacking the tension that audiences expect, and, as a Jason Statham movie, it's lacking in Jason Statham scenes, which audiences will also expect. Despite my criticism and lukewarm rating, I still liked 13, and I'd probably recommend it to people who haven't seen the original. However, I'd highly recommend you see the original, instead. It's a better movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A darkly entertaining movie about an underworld game of Russian Roulette. Winner gets money..losers die. Good cast, OK movie. I say B-</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"All players, eyes on the bulb, when it lights up you shoot." After a impulse decision to steal a man's identity, Vince (Riley) becomes a contestant in a game of Russian roulette. The winner gets a little more then a million, the loser...dies. Never having seen the original I wasn't sure what to expect, and honestly I watched this because of Statham. The beginning was a little slow, but when the game started it really picked up and was interesting and very disturbing at the same time. Comparing this to "Death Race" I think is acceptable as it involves people doing their best to survive in a grotesque game. While "Death Race" was about cars and you had more of a separation from the killing, this one is in your face. Spin the chamber, cock the hammer, point at someone's head, while someone does the same to you, then shoot. Either you live for next round or you don't. This is a pretty good movie with a good cast (not counting 50 Cent) and is a neat idea. I just think it was missing something. I think it was making you feel for the characters. You just don't seem to care who lives or dies, and that hurts the movie. Overall, an entertaining movie that is worth watching, if for no other reason then morbid curiosity. I give it a B-.Would I watch again? - I don't think so.*Also try - Death Race 1 &amp; 2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor and unnecessary remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>13 is the story of a naive young man assumes a dead man's identity and finds himself trapped in a underground world driven by greedy for power and violence. There, gangsters betting on other people's lives.It is the American version of the French film "13 Tzameti" that I liked it very much but this rather gave me some smiles along. Beginning of the film where Vince is an electrician is too fast, we see him in glimpses when he connects two wires to a switch, Emmanuelle Chriqui appears for a few seconds but the good part is that True Blood fans have the chance to see Eric in another role than the vampire.Sequences follow each other too smoothly and leaves the viewer thinking about the scenes and have to put them together to understand what is happening. Another remake which I think is pointless.</fullReview>

There was no proper feeling to this film and it seemed quite rushed. I was somewhat bored throughout the film. The actual gun scenes were decent, but with a little effort, they could have been amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into this film i had bad expectations after reading some other reviews and having a cousin who'd seen it tell me it was a poor film with a bad ending, i went in expecting another expendables where its all big actors but a terrible film, i was pleasantly surprised by the story which had a lot of suspense and some good acting especially from the main character who I've not seen in any other project, a few things were slightly strange like the reason to put UFC fighter Forrest griffin as a minor role and then dub over his voice with a horrible accent, the man can speak for himself and i found that quite insulting, anyway that aside it was enjoyable and i found myself surprised by it, my last point is the ending which some people have said was bad, in my opinion this shaped things up nicely, Jason's character runs off with the money because we know him as a money hungry greedy man and this stays true, the main character eats the paper to stop the police or anyone else finding out about everything that happened and ultimately reclaiming the money which was send to his family, maybe we could have seen the money and the lamb arrive at the house and the reactions by the family which would have been a good send off but thats just my opinion, overall surprising film, no classic and a one time watch but better than i thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad script, waste of talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently an impressive film in the original 2005 French-Georgian version, but this remake doesn't cut it. The tension is there in the Russian roulette and duel scenes, and there are competent or even very good actors involved (Mickey Rourke is becoming a specialist at playing the down and out loser with a heart; he's terrific here), but even they can't save this from a bad script. It looks like director-writer Gela Babluani wanted to Hollywoodise his original small budget foreign-film festival winner style film not by special effects but by introducing Rain Man style back stories, in particular an illogical one between Jason Statham as a tout who, inexplicably, can raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to bet on human lives yet keeps his brother (Ray Winstone) in an asylum (Rain Man!) and takes him out (Rain Man!) to compete in these scenarios (apparently, this one is his fourth). Mommy and daddy left money to take care of him (Rain Man!) but Statham inexplicably feels the need to make his brother flirt with death and bring him wealth (Rain Man!). In the end, we are left to wonder if he kills the main character (well played by Sam Riley) for his accidental winnings or to avenge the death of his brother. There are other back stories that are just as much rip offs or, worse, just thrown in to humanise (I guess) the characters. The problem is that nearly every one has a back story, and so there is no time or place to develop any of them (except the Statham-Winstone one, with disastrous, unmotivated and unexplained results). This is a typical example where well-known and competent actors can't save a bad script. Just because we are all able and willing to suspend our disbelief and accept Wookies and vampires for an hour and half doesn't mean we suspend our disbelief in basic emotions and psychology. It's really a shame, because the premise is good, the initial set up explaining how an ordinary young man (Riley) gets involved in a life and death game is handled well, good casting (except for getting names to play bit parts and hopefully revitalise their careers, which seems a little Love Boat style to me), good lighting and camera work (I'm not sure if it was just my version, but I thought the flat lighting that made everyone's face a little lifeless and that transformed sweat into grease was well done, if intentional), but then it all falls apart from the ridiculous attempts to humanise the players. Not horrible, but a waste of talent.</fullReview>

Great plan, Jason Statham. Get him on a deserted train and shoot him at a deserted station. Only in (somewhere that's not) America!

		<fullReview>I didn't know this was a remake or lets call it an Americanisation from the same Director, for the looks of it, the black and white original version looks to be more thrilling in its appearance. This is a Tense film from start to finish, what makes this film work is the style, it is gloomy and have a very dark setting, in general the film is brutal or savage, it is a very dark thriller with suspense and almost nail-biting moments.I think for a film like this, it should have been even more dark, we have to have a somewhat American happy ending, and the Russian roulette scenes should also have been more raw, gloomy and maybe gory. It doesn't really work, there are some great scenes and moments, but it isn't enough to make it all good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faux pas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got it. I know why this movie is so weak. The premise was intriguing (even though beastly, I know, what do you want, it's the spirit of the times) and the choice to keep the tone dry, understated, was correct in my opinion ? it could have been a classic in its own manner. Bland dialogues? Within the average, if you ask me, and what did you expect anyway in such a context? Literature? Comedy? No, the dialogues are alright. What then? Too many talents in too little space? False problem. Why would it be better with worse actors? Makes no sense. Slow directing? Not a fault in itself, it's not an explosion, jaw punching, explosion, Bruce Willis, roll on the floor, explosion, kill the bastards movie. No, there must be something else. Eventually, after a bit of head scratching, I got it. All what would have been shortcomings in an action movie, here sort of fits, because it's not an action movie, it's a story centered one. And there you go. The story has one massive, afflicting, unavoidable fallacy. Like ? my girlfriend is beautiful and very charming, she's just got two heads. Both have a very cute face, but it's still one too many! I mean ? the dying father and the no-choice factor just don't add up. It's not that they necessarily conflict with each other, nor that they are "too much" in terms of plausibility (in this movie? that's a laugh). No, they're actually one too many. It's two stories overwritten one on the other. It's spurious.In other words ? the movie would have been much more interesting if A) there is a dying father, the guy gets to the house, is still given the choice to do it or not and he chooses to do it for his father, or B) there is no dying father, the guy is an average Joe just looking for some mystery and adventure, but when he gets to the house ? ha! ? there's no way back. They're two different stories, either valuable. Together, they're pizza with spaghetti on top.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well done, for what it is? Yes. Question is whether what it is is what you're looking for, and I don't see how it could be.Sure, competition Russian Roulette is engaging: who lives and who dies will grab your attention (or drive it away). That those playing (so to speak) or betting include an all-action- star cast will grab your attention even more. That they implement those roles with all the tension they're famous for makes it all even more engaging. The high financial stakes and dramatic conspiratorial setting nudges that even higher. But what's so engaging? what's it about? The taglines say it all: spin, aim, |maybe| survive ... who will be the last man standing? It's just mass Russian Roulette. That's really not interesting, not compelling, doesn't take the viewer to a higher or more interesting place. It doesn't even take the viewer so much to a lower place. The big action stars don't do anything they're famous for. Even the happy ending gets completely deflated, positive but as little so as possible. It's just perfunctory tragedy. I don't think I've ever actually thrown out a movie before. This is something I want other people to _not_ see, so out it went and up goes this review.</fullReview>

The family, has to mortgage the house and who knows how they will be able to survive because of the medical bills they must pay. While rewiring a house, Vince overhears a man talking on the phone about how he will get a lot of money from an unknown source. Vince realizes he has stumbled in a possible solution for his worries. So when the man in the house overdoses and dies, he steals the paper that has the information the dead man was looking into.Vince has no idea what he is getting into. After picking up the instruction the dead man was to get, he decides to assume the dead man's identity. He must travel to a remote area where he will be met. In the envelope he found a card bearing the number 13. Not having a clue as to what he is about to do, Vince is drawn into an unpleasant situation that might even cost him his life for he enters uncharted territory where different people will enter a game of Russian roulette, something he never imagined to ever been involved.Gela Babluani remade his own "13 Tzameti" into a Hollywood film which pales in comparison with the original. Mr. Babluani got help with the screenplay in collaboration with Greg Pruss transposing the action to America. The film, although not horrible, pales in comparison with the grittier first take. The main flaw was the casting of Sam Riley, a wonderful actor, who in here does not project enough fear as the man who might lose his own life in the game. The direction leaves a lot to be desired and the screenplay does not clarify things either. The rich people betting millions of dollars are in for the thrill of it all as well as the profits they can realize. Jasper turns out to biggest loser of all. Not only does he lose the money he borrowed but he suffers a personal loss as well.The cast includes big stars like Jason Statham, playing a variation of his tough guy he is always seen in. The wonderful Ray Winstone has nothing to do in the film, nor is he effective as in other parts where he has appeared. Michael Shannon is a sort of an MC giving the instructions to all the players. Mickey Rourke is Jefferson playing a bandit who might, or might not have a lot of money stashed away. Ben Gazzara is seen as a gambling man with a nose for picking out winners.</fullReview>

When the man overdoses on drugs, Vince find instructions and a cell phone that the man has received and substitutes himself. He has no idea what it's about. He ends up at a remote house where wealthy men bet on who will survive a game of Russian roulette: he's number 13......It's surprising just how many famous faces are in this movie, and for the most part, they get their fair share of screen time. And given the material they are given, they are all very good in this film.It's Riley's film though, and he really shows fear in his role, and the body language here is amazing in some parts. Of course it's not a patch on the original, that movie was visceral, and something out of the blu, and left my heart literally pounding after key scenes.This version, the tension is still there, but you do feel that they have put these other famous people in fit to up the tension of who gets killed.Standouts are the always excellent Michael Shannon as the referee, and Riley, who makes anything watchable.Ignore the fact 50 cent is in it, he's a non entity and a has been, it's good for a remake. If you haven't seen the original, you'll wonder why this didn't have a huge distribution, if you have, you will understand why.</fullReview>

The film isn't overly long and the main part of it is set in the 'arena' (out-of-the-way warehouse) where the 'players' hold guns to each others' heads and then pull the trigger on command of a shouty man up a ladder (who some people apparently found scary while I found him a bit comical as he only yells the same lines loudly, again and again throughout the whole film).The reason the film is called '13' is because our begrudging hero is number 13 in the game. And, seeing as the film is about him, you may hazard a guess that he doesn't blow his brains out in the first round.For an 'indie' flick there are some other reasonably high-profile names in the cast - namely Mickey Rourke, Ray Winstone and Jason Statham (although, for all you Statham fans, this is NOT one of his action films). There is little 'action' just the tension of one round of Russian Roulette after the next.It's not a bad film, I'm just not sure who it is intended for - it's sort of a gangster thriller with an attempt at injecting a bit of human drama into it.Having looked online at what other people thought about it, it appears that whether you like it or not will depend on your views on the ending (so you're going to have to sit through the whole film before you see what I mean by that). There are worse ways to kill just over an hour (Russian Roulette for one).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that revolves around Russian roulette, but lacks the right elements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Deer Hunter" is the last film I saw that focused in on Russian roulette. This movie focuses in totally on the game of Russian roulette but doesn't have the psychological and emotional depth or the tensity. This tries to go for that stylish and cool story direction, even if parts don't make sense. So the plot is about a underground high-stakes game where contestants either volunteer or gets forced into playing and their is a prize at the end. Of up to 1 million, eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Personally I wouldn't play the game for even a trillion dollars. The build up is weak and boring which is the first 30 minutes. The game when it starts is actually quite dull, because you only care about one of the contestants at that point. The game pulls very slight unexpected moves but overall it's pretty narrow and predictable. The only slightly tense scene is the final game...The duel. But it's after a hour of running-time in order to get to that point. Unless you fast-forward but then their is zero build up. Despite this being a cheap movie, it has quite a cast. But come of the characters are quite irrelevant and their story goes nowhere. Although I liked the short and abrupt anti-climatic ending to this. Nothing all that original, but doesn't go in that generic ending direction either. Jason Statham is also in this flick, but you won't see him headbutting, punching heads in or kicking the teeth out of his opponents. Overall it's a passable straight to DVD movie and they did alright with the resources...Which I assume was very small.5.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What To Expect: 13</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Score: 6.375 I caught this on Encore Movie channel a couple weeks ago and I am glad I had a chance to watch it. I admit to not hearing anything about this film, but it has a solid cast (Jason Statham, Mickey Rourke, Ray Winstone, Michael Shannon to name a few), is well directed, and has an intriguing storyline. I would recommend to anyone wanting to see a drama/thriller that has a story that deviates from the norm.Sam Riley is Vince Ferro, who is trying to come up with money to ensure his hospitalized father gets the care he needs to live. When an envelope that contains the opportunity to make a lot of money presents itself, Vince steals it and ends up getting more than he bargained for. After following the directions enclosed, he is transported and placed in a live or die game of Russian Roulette, where mobsters bet on who will live and die. If Vince is the last man standing, then he gets to take home some winnings for himself or he will lose his life as a result of the game.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is good and very thrilling. It gives a sense of a normal family man who will do anything for his family. The only thing that is missing is love sense. It would be better if this movie had a lover for the main actor. The movie leads out with zero idea, only if you did not read the abstract of the movie, and keeps its suspense at peak all the time. The only thing that disappointed me is that near the end of the movie--the main character COULD HAVE taken the airplane instead of a train. He could have avoid his death and the movie would have ended as a happy story. If I were the main character, I would have shipped all the money, keeps about 10k and tell the whole family to move out as soon as the money arrives, may be to a hotel for a while, change the whole family name for good. But it's a lot of work so I might not have done it. Lol. Anyway, the movie is very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. Having seen the original French version - I would have thought Hollywood would have stomped all over this.But.... They get A List stars to cameo in an "Arthouse" flick - that is something cool. And "Gold Star" merit if someone can explain how that was done.All the subtle meaning in the French original is here, almost shot for shot, plus the tension and character development but with a few extra touches that work real well. I would give extra screen time to Rourke and that is what the director does well.Only the marketing lets it down. I would have aimed for the Fincher art-house crowd here - rather that the Stratham action house fans as I think that is were the film's strengh lie.Apart from that - give it a go. Great remake and the way forward.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I waited for this one. I loved the genuine film, directed by the same guy. And it's a shame that it has not been released in France, even in DVD region 2. But maybe in the future, who knows?I understand many viewers don't like it. Many things remain obscure, I think of Jason Statham's brother motivations to enter this mad game. Yes, many things are unexplained. And what ever happens to Mickey Rourke, just after the first hour? Maybe some sequences were forgotten on the cutting floor room. The editing is not very sharp in this film. The thing I loved the most is the Jason Statham's character. Yes, I persist, this character is very unusual for him. That changes from his usual good die hard hero who always saves the widow and the orphan. The guy who beats every one. The undying good American hero.Here, with his hat - that we always see in films from the sixties - I think of a character out from a Jean Pierre Melville's feature. I don't know why. He remains a very mysterious and also unsympathetic character, and I repeat I love this. I always love what is unusual, surprising. Even if the film is not overall not so good. Who cares?Not me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to imagine that anyone would WANT to play this game.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DVD from my public library. I went into it not knowing what I was about to see. It is a grimy underbelly of wealthy sport and betting, and I found myself wondering if this sort of thing really happens.The subject matter most will find very distasteful (I did) but when you look past that it really comes down to a pretty simple story of a loving son wanting to help his father with mounting medical bills.Sam Riley is the focus, as Ohioan Vince Ferro , a hard-working young electrician. One day while in a stranger's home doing a repair he overhears something about a "job" that pays a lot of money. His dad was in the hospital, and needing yet another surgery. The home is mortgaged with no end in sight.Then when the other man ends up dead by a self-inflicted O.D., Vince intercepts a letter, goes to a mailing station, and signs for an envelope. Inside are a phone and instructions. Vince still has no idea what he is volunteering for, or what the payday might be.Saying anything more would amount to spoilers so I will mention it below, after the SPOILERS warning. Two other stars of note are Jason Statham as Jasper and Mickey Rourke as Jefferson. Who thinks up these weird things??SPOILERS: The "game" is to entertain wealthy bettors, in a large home in a secluded location in Pennsylvania. Each "participant" has a number, Vince ends up as Number 13, thus the title of the movie. Each player starts out with one bullet, then spins the chamber until directed to stop, then in a circle each aims the gun at the next fellow's head. When they pull their triggers, some die, some don't. Vince survives this first round. In next rounds they get 2, then later 3, bullets. Ultimately Vince wins, gets almost $2Million in bills in a knapsack. Afraid he will be harmed he sneaks away at night, but has a chance encounter on the train home with Jasper who waits until the train stops, shoots and kills Vince, and takes his knapsack. But it only has a stuffed animal inside, Vince had used USPS Priority Mail to send the money home, he dies but the rest of his family will be able to pay the bills.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You need to be made aware that there are disturbing scenes in this movie. You might have watched the classic 5 times Academy Awards winning 1978 movie "The Deer Hunter" in which there is a scene where characters play Russian roulette. Christopher Walken steals the show in that scene; in this movie, the Russian roulette game is taken to a whole new level. That took me by surprise and it will take you to, even if you have been forewarned. By the way an earlier 2005 French version of this, '13 Tzameti', covers the same subject and I'll comment on that one later. Read the IMDb reviews, storyline and other critics assessment to get a feel for this story, besides mine; it'll be worth it.The main character Vince is played brilliantly by Sam Riley. Riley is making a mark for himself here in the movie industry with this role. He conveys oh so well the emotional angst his character is going through. It's convincing. The director Géla Babluani has also written and directed the original 2005 French movie five years before, so he knew the script by heart. Get a load of who else is in "13", cast wise. Jason Statham to start with, plays Jasper Lyn; he's intense for reason you quickly understand but he does not do any martial arts nor any other violent acting except for the one late scene near the end when he shoots Vince. Then you have Ronald Lyn, played by Ray Winstone who adds to edginess and tension needed. Winstone can best be remembered for his role as 'Frenchie" in the 2006 hit "The Departed" and his role of "Captain Stanley" in the 2005 movie "The Proposition". Michael Shannon (fame from his key role in the TV series 'Boardwalk Empire' these days) also plays a freaky DJ of death if you will in "13". Then you have the likes of '50 cents', Mickey Rourke, David Zayas the always working tough character actor, Ben Gazzara and Alexander Skarsg?rd. The latter is recognizable from his role in the series 'True Blood'; here he plays Jack the minder for Vince.The movie will flash by in no time. There are scenes with Sam Riley's character is making scripted moves that fall short of what I call smart. The audience, I'm sure, would have come up with better and impromptu actions other than his character made. The end is too quick and leaves too many questions unanswered; the reviews and critics like me make a point of mentioning it. For the couple of scenes alone dealing with the Russian Roulette game and the filthy rich men this game allows to gamble on human lives, "13" is worth a watching.After seeing the black and white 2005 French version, I conclude that this 2010 version is much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never Assume a Dead Man's Identity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are scenes in "13" that successfully elicit a terrifying visceral thrill. There can be no other reaction to a plot that centers on underground Russian roulette and numerous shots that consist of imprisoned men holding guns to each other's heads. I've never fired or even held a gun in my life, and yet the movies have made me aware of that moment just before the trigger is pulled ? that solitary, agonizingly tense moment when time seems to stop and absolutely nothing else in the world exists apart from you and your target. What will happen next? Only one way to find out. This movie has that kind of nail-biting suspense. There's no purpose to the game; these dueling men are forced into participating and have no quarrel with each other. It exists solely for the amusement of the fabulously wealthy, who apparently have nothing better to do.Adapted by director Gela Babluani from his own 2005 French film "13 Tzameti" (unseen by me), "13" is gritty, downbeat, and profoundly disturbing. It's not all that compelling, in part because it makes an overstated and unoriginal point, but mostly because many of the situations the characters find themselves in are highly implausible. I wonder, though, if that's a natural side effect of stories with allegorical subtexts; certain societal messages, I believe, can only be heard and understood within the context of a heightened reality. As long as we're engaged, it may not matter how far-fetched a movie turns out to be. I admit, though, I didn't come to this realization until about three-quarters of the way through. Prior to that moment, I was caught up in making pointless observations about how certain scenes were not physically or dramatically possible.It tells the story of a young Ohio electrician named Vince Ferro (Sam Riley), whose family is desperately in need of money. The biggest financial drain is his father, who lies in a hospital bed bandaged and immobile after a horrible accident nearly killed him. While doing wiring work at his clients' home, Vince overhears a vague conversation between the husband and wife, in which talk of a good paying job comes up. As an added incentive, Vince notices an envelope in the husband's hand. In a rather convenient twist of fate, the husband dies overdosing on heroine, allowing Vince to steal the envelope and take his place. He has absolutely no idea what he's in for, but when large sums of money are at stake, there's almost no telling the risks some people will take.The envelope contains both a set of instructions and a cell phone. After boarding a train to Pennsylvania and checking into a hotel, a mysterious stranger calls Vince on the cell phone with further instructions. He then meets a driver (Alexander Skarsg?rd) who takes him to one of those reliable mansions in the middle of the woods. You know the kind of place I'm talking about; it's a cold, secluded estate made of bricks and sculpted masonry, where eccentric millionaires regularly convene to indulge in their twisted pastimes. Despite fessing up to taking a dead man's identity, Vince is assigned the number thirteen and forced to take part in the aforementioned roulette games, where his life will be betted on along with the lives of other "contestants." These include an American smuggled out of a Mexican prison (Mickey Rourke) and a newly released mental patient (Ray Winstone), whose bettor is his very own brother (Jason Statham).The emcee (Michael Shannon) shouts out instructions to the "players" as if a blood vessel in his head were about to burst. This deeply unpleasant character, whose intensity betrays a curious sense of focus, initially comes off as a grating one-note typecast but is soon revealed as the film's emotional precursor; the way he speaks and moves gives the viewer insight as to how the rest of the movie will go. As he miraculously makes his way through the rounds ? and I should point out that each round sees an additional bullet put into the gun barrel ? Vince will make the understandable transition from frightened to a state of manic desperation. He knows that other men have his life in their hands, and vice versa.Although highly devastating, the ending effectively forces us to think beyond the scope of what we see on screen. Everyone is a victim in this movie, even those we might consider villains ? and for a couple of characters, that distinction is separated by a very fine line. The conclusion is inescapable, if a little too obvious: Absolutely no one wins in the frantic pursuit of money. Is it at all a coincidence that Vince is assigned a number many consider unlucky? I can't say that I came away from "13" with a better understanding of human nature, although I can say that I was intrigued all throughout, and that it did what it set out to do and gave me a good thrill. It also kept me guessing, although not about the plot so much as the tone. Action is fairly predictable in most movies, but sometimes there's no way of knowing how a character is feeling at any given moment.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)</fullReview>

Wasted, John Bedford Lloyd-wasted, I can go on but I think you get the picture.Here's a case where you have an interesting premise, great talent, good crew BUT A REALLY BAD DIRECTOR! This guy hasn't a clue what he's doing. There was absolutely no thought that went into this picture. It's so bland and boring, even aggravatingly stupid at times. Why do you get all of this great talent together just to say a few meaningless lines of dialogue? And the ending is a total bummer. Resolve the story. Too many neophyte directors leave open ended stories for no reason. I suppose they want to give the impression that there is more there in the subtext. Fact is those opened ended stories that work actually tie up all the loose ends in their own way. I blame the director for the script which never realizes it's full potential. Maybe English is some stumbling block for him because his original film '13 Tzameti ' won several awards. Looks like Coppola's proclamation of modern technology leading to the democratization of the motion picture business will only lead to its untimely death. Making a compelling film takes a lot of hard work which obviously didn't go into this production. People just mill about the frame rambling meaningless dialogue. There are no moments of fear, tranquility, jovial humor, black humor, tension (and believe me there should have been a lot of moments of EXTREME tension) or anything really. It just sits there like a lump of crap. Just one long spewing of sterile narrative when if executed properly, this story could have had a lot of spunk. It's a very sexy story with a myriad of possibilities, but no one was home to get the FedEx. The director phoned it in on this one folks. Avoid like the plague. Oh yeah, there are no commuter trains that run between New York City and Ohio.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I liked this movie. I found it interesting - very tense - with an actual (over-the top) plot that has a beginning, a middle, and an end. Sam Riley, as the main protagonist, really held it together. I personally got invested in his character, and I was not "deflated" in the end, as some reviewers seem to have been.I enjoyed the vignettes of some of the various characters' backgrounds. Seems to me those are important aspects to the story. This is a diverse group of individuals, which made it interesting to me. All of the cast members effectively contributed to the mix. (Maybe Rourke was a bit over-the-top). I enjoyed seeing Statham in a less in-your-face role than usual, although I had some problems interpreting whatever across-the-pond accent he employed this time around.I did find one significant plot element (only one??) suspicious, but by that time I had suspended my disbelief, was invested in Sam Riley's character, and was enjoying the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Predictable and Wandering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A naive young man assumes a dead man's identity and finds himself embroiled in an underground world of power, violence, and chance where men gamble behind closed doors on the lives of other men.The concept of this film is really good, and from what I hear the original is pretty spectacular. And I have to give them credit for having the original creator return for the English version (not unlike "Funny Games"). But I just did not connect with this one as much as I hoped.The basic idea is good and could fill a solid hour, but then extra stuff is thrown in. We get background stories of some of the men in the ring. Sure, that is character development... but for what purpose? All we need to know about any of them is that they either shoot or are shot (or both). Does it matter to me that Mickey Rourke spent time in a Mexican prison? And, as I say, there is a certain level of predictability. I will not give anything away, but you can guess who will survive with a fairly high degree of accuracy. And you can also fairly easily guess the ending. I am a bit disappointed in this because it took a good suspense story and made it completely deflate on me.I will have to see the original, but my assumption is that it is far better than the remake. Perhaps Ray Liotta was right to turn down this film.</fullReview>

There has been movies similar to this genre before.But at least those movies made up by having decent action sequences(Condemned) or some slick dialogs and screenplay.At least the ending would have been made different and suspenseful,that would have caught the audience's attention. '13' had none of these and falls flat.A Stupidest survival thriller ever made!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I pop the DVD into the player, I didn't know what to expect. I know Jason Statham is in the movie but I didn't know what the story is about. Of course I didn't know it was a remake and the director's name is totally new to me. All of the above has made this a pleasant cinematic experience for me. I have to confess that I fell asleep not long after the movie started because I was pretty tired that day. I was woken by the shout of the umpire (moderator?) and saw the spider light bulb turned on. I was captivated by the following scene and wide awake for the rest of the film. I think the acting is superb, Sam Riley has done a great job transitioning from a fear stricken first round player to the seething finalist. Michael Shannon is also great as the umpire; you can sense the evil in him playing god. The wickedness can also be found among the gamblers and their complete disregard (disrespect) for human lives. Even the light bulb has some evilness in it! The director perhaps trying to relay the message that we are just pawns of fate and there is no escape in the end. It is a pretty dark movie but the mood is consistent throughout and captivating overall. Ignorant is bliss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...in the sense that it is usually so that more famous actors spend more time on screen, i.e. it is predictable who will remain "intact" to the end. And as all the characters apart from the main one (well, but not excellently played by Sam Riley) are unvaried, it is a waste of good actors like Ray Winstone, Jason Statham or Mickey Rourke to be exploited in such a movie.The plot is somewhat thrilling until the challenge is over, the rest is only dull prolongation where the police/criminals storyline remains open, although the total film is less than 1,5 hours. The ending is unanticipated, but if I were the director, I would have amended it towards bigger elaboration.I have not seen the original French film, but I have read it is much better.

		<fullReview>This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Even though I only paid $1 to rent this movie, I still feel cheated. Sam Riley's character Vince steals another man's identity in the hope of making some quick cash to pay for his father's medical bills. Unwittingly he is forced to compete in a game of Russian roulette, surrounded by rich mafia types who bet big money on the outcome of the "duel". For me, this movie was an epic fail for two main reasons: 1. I couldn't come to grips with the main premise of the movie - that big stakes gamblers would gamble on a game of pure chance. 2. I felt no sympathy for Sam Riley's character - I felt he deserved a bullet for his stupidity in getting himself into that situation. Lastly, the DVD cover is misleading - it gives the appearance of Jason Statham being the lead actor, but his screen time is minimal. The lead actor is Sam Riley, who says little and does his best to look sick and scared all the time.</fullReview>

I usually like Jason Statham movies but this was honestly his worst. I never leave reviews for movies but I felt compelled to review this one. Like I said above it actually made me and my wife angry. And trust me, I am not exaggerating. It really was as bad as I am making it sound. I would not want another person to have to waste 1 minute of their precious time and money watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great thriller with anti-climatic ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great action thriller movie. I found myself sitting on the edge of my seat multiple times during the movie and I thought that it was overall nicely executed. I feel that the ending could have been handled differently, as I was not expecting the film to end so abruptly.I recommend this movie to anybody that enjoys a great action movie, however, my advice to you is not to dwell on the many possibilities and paths that the movie COULD have taken, as there are plenty of things that could have happened in reality.Overall, I rate this movie an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrible compared to the original 13 Tzameti. I recommend that everyone watches the black and white version with English subtitles and steers clear of this one. This remake was most likely a vain attempt to pad the pockets by milking an over-saturated market that necessitates familiarity and a complete lack of suspense and subtlety. The entire premise of the film is ruined with poor 'foreshadowing' less than a minute in and worse acting throughout. The scenes and characters are predominantly bizarro reflections of a movie that was done perfectly well in the first place, and ends up destroying any hope that this remake could add anything of value within the first 30 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this remake a day after watching the original and was a bit uncertain whether it could be as good, but the colours and photography in the film were great, the minor differentiations in the story by Babluani greatly appreciated and a very good set of actors, also. At times, some of them seemed to try a bit too hard in my opinion, compared to the french version, but still, if I'd never seen the original film, I think I would have given it more than 7. Highly recommended, but I also recommend that you watch 13 Tzameti, too, because of the whole film noir atmosphere which brings a somewhat more poetic outcome (it's also in black &amp; white). Really looking forward to seeing more from this director! ...Great work!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie I ever saw.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So there i was sitting in the morale tent in Afghanistan when the Lt brought in a movie he had bought(poor guy) and little did we know, the Afghanistan experience was about to get a little worse. We could barely hear the beginning of the movie, all we really knew was that we were being bored to death. Considering we just watched "Knight and Day" a couple days prior, we were really hoping to see a movie that was entertaining...or at least had a half naked girl in it. But watching movies these days is a little bit like playing Russian Roulette, sometimes you pick a movie that feels like a bullet to the head. I guess thats where this movie shines, because Russian Roulette is actually the plot and from what i gather it makes for a pretty lucrative betting franchise. If you left "Requiem for a Dream" feeling like you just saw the most uplifting feel good story of your life, then you will love this movie. If your NOT a sick bastard, like most of us, then you will probably feel like crap the entire movie. The writer, having watched the Deer Hunter WAAAYYY too many time, thought it would be a good idea to just make a whole movie about guys standing in a circle shooting each other in the head. Each round of betting goes by and another bullet is added until (Spoiler alert in case you didn't read the title of this god awful movie) 13 becomes the victor and shortly afterwords is killed by an obvious person in predictable fashion. Its not all a fun and games so if your not a sports fan Don't worry. When the characters aren't shooting each other in the head, they are laying in the fetal position in the break room crying until the next round starts. If thats not enough of a break between the action packed "spin the cylinder, wait till the light comes on, fire" sequences, the cameras also go to the bookies taking bets from tux wearing high rollers. Lots of Big names grace the screen in a movie that must have taken almost 2 hours to film, and 3 minutes to write on a napkin at "Denny's" after a night of binge drinking. You care nothing of any of the characters and during the first round of betting you hope every contestants gun goes off. This film was so bad that i went and became a registered user just to post this review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching the original, it was the first time I believed a Hollywood remake could be an improvement. I'm amazed to find out I was right. All of my hangups concerning the original have been addressed here. First of all, Babluani has an exceptional eye for color. It adds to the depth and tragic aesthetic, more so than black and white. I found this film to be very tense at times, whereas the original just sort of limped along. Even though I knew what was going to happen, I was still enthralled and captivated. This was mainly due to the inclusion of some humanity to the piece. More characters are explored and defined. Even minor roles explode, such as Skarsgard's caring driver. The only flat acting comes from 50 Cent. Luckily, he's quite a minor role. Michael Shannon takes a simple role as an emcee, and transforms it into a terrifying and interesting character. The man is cinematic dynamite and has an intensity that is now being recognized. Winstone and Rourke add some empathy to their hard men roles. For s a film I had already seen, this was still exciting stuff, and I enjoyed it on more levels than the original. Well done to the director for improving on his potential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, the video photography was great, wonderful actors were involved in the project however, if your looking for a good movie to watch this is not the best choice. The beginning is slow, the middle is designed to leave the viewer feeling anxious and the end is over quickly and without explanation. The movie left me with a feeling of well- one can only describe it as- emptiness. I was actually quite disappointed I had wasted nearly two hours of my life watching this and whilst I love Jason Statham, he wasn't a central character, but one who I was not fond of by the end. I would strongly recommend people not to watch this unless they like pointless movies with horrible story morals.</fullReview>

As the OP would like to suggest this is yet again another film in the Hollywood machine, I would argue that the original 13 director/writer Géla Babluani is behind the helm yet again.Géla Babluani was given a chance to do what many filmmakers dream of doing.... remaking their films with a Hollywood budget and the chance to put top tier actors into their work. The eclectic mix of actors is amazing..... Jason Stratham, Ray Winstone, Mickey Rourke, and David Zayas who American audiences know from his many roles as detectives.If you could handle Tzameti 13 you'll love 13.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>13....out of 100</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying this movie is terrible. I cannot believe all the people involved in this movie thought it was fine to release. The plot is slow, boring, and predictable. The acting by most of the crew is awful. The soundtrack is one of the worst and most inappropriate I have seen used in a movie. Frankly, other than a solid (yet very scene- limited) performance by Mickey Rourke, there is really absolutely nothing going for this film.I am used to watching good movies, so this one just came across as so bad in my eyes. I figured I had an hour and a half to kill before bed, why not watch an entertaining action flick? That was a big mistake. Even bigger than the one of putting 50 cent in as an actor in this film. I was constantly waiting for this movie to just finish, because I didn't want to cut short an already wasted 45 minutes. Now I wish I had just cut my losses and head to bed early. I realized at the end that I would have rather just done math homework over watching this, at least I would have done something productive, and probably would have been more entertained.There is so much bad in this movie, I would rather not delve into every single little thing. I just want people to understand this movie is god- awful, and that if someone is even on the fence about watching it, do not. It is not entertaining, it is not funny, it is not slick. 13 is often seen as an unlucky number. Today, it was mine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epitomises the worthless/pointless remake - watch Tzameti instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first IMDb review.... I was so frustrated by this excuse for entertainment that I feel compelled to warn people off it.I watched Tzameti, the French film upon which this is based, and loved it. I approached the remake with well-founded scepticism. I can't write an objective review since the only enjoyment I took from this was a concurrent mental playback of Tzameti, otherwise I would want my time and money refunded for sitting through this garbage.Remakes can, and occasionally do, have merit - take the Coen brothers' marvellous True Grit. The original was fine, watchable and entertaining - even showcasing glimpses of an ability to act from the normally wooden Wayne. Tzameti is a very good film deserves to be watched: that it stands up to repeated viewing is testament to the craft with which it was made. I bought the DVD and have delighted in watching it with friends at least 6 times. The facts that it's subtitled, monochrome, you've probably never heard of anyone involved in making it and don't know what the title means are soon shelved and you simply become gripped by a fine story, well told.This remake didn't deserve to go to DVD which I can only assume it did. The only positive outcome from watching 13 would be that it might inspire someone to watch Tzameti - regrettably that's unlikely as this garbage is so off-putting and those who enjoy 13 are unlikely to watch anything subtitled, monochrome......Watch Tzameti with the lights off. Watch 13 with the power off.</fullReview>

Then, the most annoying part, and I'm literally screaming at the screen "Idiot!", is after he wins the contest and all that money the fool goes back to Grand Central Station to take a train home (where he met his untimely demise as expected). I was like idiot rent a car and drive yourself home so one will be able to track you. In fact, I would have hid out in the city in a hotel for a couple of days and then rented the car.

		<fullReview>It's funny, when I rented this movie, I hadn't read the synopsis (which is common with me, because I want to enjoy the movie without knowing much about it prior to watching it). So the movie began and I had this Deja Vu. A very strong one that is. And of course I remembered (four years might have passed and countless movies since then), but Tzameti was one of the better movies I had watched.And now the (inevitable?) US remake then. Unfortunately even with all that "Star-Power" (Statham, Rourke etc.) the movie failed to convince me. Even the original director came back on board for this (he apparently needed the money), but it still lacks. Talk about lost in translation ... Not a bad movie, but don't expect it to be an action movie, rather a drama and you might find it intriguing enough (especially without having seen the original that is).</fullReview>

When you start realizing that the film is coming to an end, you also start to shout things like: "why doesn't he do this... or he should go this way, why didn't he do that...".You kind of feel like the Writers and Director where in a hurry for finishing the film and they led the main character thru a course of bad decisions that got him into the must UNEXPECTED End, but not unexpected in a good way, believe me!

		<fullReview>There are too many long and boring scenes supposed to be thrilling. Director trynna give us the "tension" and some blood, however we can't get these.

But my conclusive decision is that this movie is totally commercial, and i don't appreciate it. Tzameti was cooler. But I admit the scenario is same. And this movie is (these movies are) wounded by it.By the way... What the hell was the police scene? Huh? I can't imagine I ain't gonna be watched after I involve in a criminal situation. Think 'bout this. Policeman asks some questions to the suspect, then let him go, and he doesn't care him. Anyone, even one cop, doesn't follow him. He goes back, digs out the garbage bags, finds the money bag, then goes in a unlimited freedom. Watch and forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terribly directed. Seriously, a real disaster for someone who could gather 3 or 4 famous actors and convince them to get in this project. The music! Hey, director, there's no need to fill every single minute of the movie with loud music, cause not every moment is intense or thrilling. YOU DON'T ACHIEVE DRAMATIC SCENES BY ONLY PLAYING MUSIC ON THE BACKGROUND, and especially if the music doesn't really fit at all with what is happening. Acting is very bad as well, with a few exceptions, like the main character (he does it well) or Mickey Rourke. The story is not bad, maybe needs a couple of twists to get a little more believable. The problem here is direction. Maybe is inexperience, maybe is very bad taste, but the final outcome is embarrassing. I couldn't avoid feeling that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary Remake of a Bad Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨13 didn't pull the trigger. You have to pull the trigger.¨ 13 is a remake of a 2005 Georgian film ¨13 Tzameti¨ which was also written and directed by Gela Babluani. Unlike the original film in which Babluani also stared, this time the film had a lot of known Hollywood actors and it was filmed in color. The film has an interesting concept and it could have worked for a short film, but not for a full length feature film. Even at 97 minutes long the movie feels stretched and the dialogue really didn't help either. There are some interesting and thrilling moments, but not enough to save this film. I had no idea what 13 was about before watching it so at the beginning I was drawn and intrigued to what was going to happen, but after the suspense was over the film got lost in the narrative. I also was expecting more from the cast because there were some interesting actors involved in the project, but the only real one who stands out in this film was Sam Riley (who I loved in Control). Riley gave a great performance and he is probably the best thing about this film. Mickey Rourke, Jason Statham, Alexander Skarsgard, and Michael Shannon were all underused, and they had little screen time to truly shine. With a better script this movie could have been much better. I was also a little disappointed with the ending, but I don't want to give anything away, so I won't say anything more about it.The less you know about the plot probably the better, but since the movie isn't really that good I will go ahead and tell you about it. If you don't want to know anything about the story then just go ahead and skip this paragraph. Vince (Sam Riley) is an electrician who has to put his home on mortgage in order to pay for his father's operations because he's very ill. Apparently the operation isn't successful and they have to operate him again, which means Vince is going to need more money. That same day while he is working at someone's house named William (Michael Berry Jr.) he overhears him speaking to his wife about the opportunity he just got of making a lot of money, while holding an envelope he just opened in his hands. That same day, William overdoses, and Vince doesn't hesitate in taking the envelope and trying to figure out if he can make some money in his place. In the envelope he finds a number of hints that will lead him to some sort of secret place. Once he arrives to the location indicated he is taken by a driver named Jack (Alexander Skarsgard) to an underground building where a lot of wealthy people are gathered together making bets. He is given a number, 13, and before he can back out he discovers that he is part of a deadly game where other men gamble on his life. There are others just like him such as Jefferson (Mickey Rourke), Ronald (Ray Winstone), and many more that are all given numbers and are forced to point guns at each other with one bullet. They all have to shoot, those who are lucky survive.13 is really poorly developed. The concept was interesting at first, but it got really boring after a while thanks in most part to a terrible script and very little character development. There were so many characters that were just wasted in the film and some of the background stories that were told about them were useless. Mickey Rourke and Jason Statham are both great actors, but their roles in this film were absolutely pointless. I really don't understand how a movie like this needed to be made. The only positive thing I can say about 13 is that Sam Riley had a lead role and he was great. He was the only character that was really developed, and he did a decent job with the poor material he had to work with. There were a couple of intense moments, but like I said before, it could have worked well in a short film, but not in a movie like this. I really wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you are a fan of Sam Riley (in that case just watch Control all over again and skip this).http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

With some ingenuity, odds could be worked out, as if it was a dice game, where the odds are the same for every throw of the die...However, for the second round, 67% chance of losing per man, third round 50%, fourth round 33%...However, I will agree that it seemed to be a movie about gratuitous violence, except for the fact that such 'games' are occasionally reported in the news...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cinematography today is obvious. It is either full of awful remakes, or blockbuster movies for one time watching, mostly. Rarely, there are movies that have something original and at the same way good quality that can be easily put in home movie library. The 13 is one of the kinds that can be easily put in the state of something different. There are unfortunately, weaknesses in many segments, but overall it is a fine movie. What is of such a interest is so many well known movie and TV shows stars that we see here. In 13 some of the popular actor's takes only marginal role, and unknown actors (main character) and actors well known from TV shows takes the pride. I will not criticize here like some smart ass, but we have ghastly plot that is positioned in a positive context and it is a motivation of the main character for positive reasons, to help his family in financial aspect. The main character is delightful in its acting, and even he is at the end a tragic hero, it have good realistic message. Simply to describe, if you are lucky outsider, an ordinary person, you will end badly in experienced world of criminals. The prize in this case is only kept by wisdom of the main character, but at the end the same character ends tragically. There is however so many holes, unanswered questions, and no logic rhythm, but the movie is very original in idea and in its somehow macabre style, with few surrealism perspectives in scenes with deadly game promoter/judge (amazing acting of Michael Shannon). By all means, recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack (Skarsgard) has mounting medical bills to pay and finds a way to make money by taking the identity of a deceased man who was to compete in a game of Russian Roulette. There is heavy betting among the audience and the survivor gets a lot of money. The police know this is going on but cannot find the place where it happens. Let's be clear: this is NOT about Dr. House's intern, 13.This only goes to prove that Hollywood doesn't know what to do with itself anymore. Jack goes to the competition only knowing that he can make a lot of money, but not really knowing what it is all about. He is not allowed to decline.Most of the movie is the game itself. The game progresses with each contestant being given one bullet, then two, then three, then four. They load the bullets, raise their weapons, spin the chambers, point the gun at the head of the contestant in front of him in a line; and when the bulb lights up they are to shoot. We go thru this for 4-rounds. I knew to avert my eyes when they spun the chambers, and kept telling myself, "it's only a movie." I just hope this kind of thing doesn't happen in real life. This is definitely not for everyone, actually, I would say not for "anyone." The pull for me was to see what happens after the competition. After the competition, the movie settles into a cat and mouse game with the police and this is quite good. The ending had to be the way it happened because the results would have come to pass regardless of precautions taken.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not that I expected a lot, but the film itself was not interesting to me. It was not 100% predictable, but still boring. No suspense, no drama, no nothing. It was supposed to have actors who play deep dramatic roles as it was required by scenario but instead you have charming Statham who tries to bend the brows but you can't believe he's a bad guy. Mickey Rourke is not even funny this time. If you've seen him in Iron man - that's exactly the same way he plays here. I even think he didn't bother to change the make up since the previous film. Appearance of Mickey Rourke, 50 Cent and Ray Liotta does not help. It is a first time I see Sam Riley and he did not impress at all. He was not able to show the level of tension one would expect in such circumstances. He is a boy at the very beginning of the movie at things happening with him will definitely change his personality, but it happens too quickly and oops! he's a coldblooded lad who lies to cops without batting an eye and kills man enjoying his victory . Moreover, the script is a bit hectic but still very slow. Statham and Ray Winstone are probably the best part of 13.Wait until it out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just returned from the premiere screening of 13 in Tbilisi. I want to make parallels between original and remake. I've seen many remakes and their originals, but those remade ones had added something new and fresh. I was watching 13 and I had impression that I've already watched it earlier. It was original one converted in colors. Black &amp; White was one of the main factor that added to original one high tension. 13 has almost every minor nuance that is shown in Tzameti, same actions, places, characters. Dialogues are just translated from French to English. Only difference is that characters of Mickey Rourke and 50 Cent don't appear in Tzameti. I realize that Gela made that movie for Americans and the target audience is the people who haven't seen Tzameti, but for us who were waiting for 2-3 years for that he didn't add anything new to his project.Despite my disappointing I think that this movie deserves recognition and success. If I haven't watched Tzameti, I'd undoubtedly love 13.Gela Babluani is one of the most hopeful movie directors nowadays and I hope that he'll gain recognition and will make his new projects successfully. I'll be proud with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Famous actors don't guarantee success.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie it supposed to be a thriller and a drama. They failed in both. You won't be thrilled no matter how many minutes you see the protagonist being pointed with the gun. No matter how much emphasis the director gives in this "Russian roulette". There is also no drama there. You won't feel sympathetic or pity for none of these actors despite the directors efforts. Not for the kid that accidentally gets into this, not for the criminal that's is forced to risk his life, not for the two brothers (the manager and the "player"). It's just a slow movie full of killings for gambling. The plot is so slow that at least half an hour of this movie is useless.Forget the action, forget the thrill. Plain movie with nothing to show, meaningless. Famous actors are not enough.The friend i was watching it with went to see videos on you-tube. I kept watching this believing something will happen. I was wrong.The fact that we have a new and developed Russian just makes it worse. Who had that idea!? At least the traditional one would have probably made this movie a little betterP.S. The word "spin" was mentioned too many times in this movie that lost it's meaning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasting my favorite actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi,I was really excited when I first saw the cast and the director. And so perhaps I set a high standard for my expectations. Because the cast is like an all star team to me. So I think they really wasted some true talents in this movie. The scenario is really interesting but the movie is a bit boring. The idea is a killer so maybe they thought it could carry out the whole movie. But unfortunately it didn't. Still worth to see though. An electrician, desperate for money, replaces a client which kills himself. Follows the directions he is given and finds himself in an underworld hell.To sum up its more brilliant than most of the movies you see every day. But still a waste of these talents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was surprised how good this movie was. I really enjoyed it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone gave me this movie and I never heard of it. It had some stars as well as solid veteran actors. One of the cast members was 50 Cent, the rapper. That immediately made me wary of this film because any movie with rappers will usually suck. Luckily, 50 Cent was only a peripheral character; in fact, he was OK .The movie is quite gritty and realistic in its outcome. The premise though was unexpected but I kind of thought there would be some sort of illegal activity but nothing like this.The movie starts out with a family in Talbot, Ohio. The father had an accident and is in a full body cast at the hospital. The son tells the father that they sold their home to pay for his medical expense. The father laments over this but the son states it is OK and that he will be working as an electrician. At a job, he hears a man state that this letter will make him wealthy but does not elaborate. The man overdoses on drugs and dies. While the ambulance is taking the body, the son steals the letter.At home, the son reads the letter. It states to go to a certain location to pick up a letter. He does and it has money and cell phone. It states he has to go to New York City to await further instruction. He does but unknown to him, he is being followed by police. At New York, he gets a phone call to come to a particular point in a rural road somewhere in Pennsylvania. He does and he is picked up and driven to a house deep in the woods. The police lose him during this time. At the house, he is stripped searched for police detection device but there is none so he is allowed to dress and he is driven to a mansion in a middle of nowhere.In front of the mansion are expensive cars. He meets the people who have been given him his instruction. They see him and recognize it is not the correct person. He tells them truthfully what happened and that he can leave if they are not satisfied but they tell him it is too late to find someone else and he has no choice but to participate. All this time, he does not know what is going on but you can tell he really wishes to leave now but he knows they will not let him leave alive. There are only men at this scene and they are placing bets.He is told to wear a shirt with a number 13 on it and to stand on a platform. There are other participants, maybe a total of 14. The participants are in a circle. Each one faces the back of the head of one of the other participants. Each one is given a revolver and 1 bullet and told to put it in. They are told to raise the gun up in the air and to spin the cylinder. After several spins, they are told to stop and cock the gun and point it to the back of the head of the person in front of them. There is one ceiling light in the middle of this circle. They are to look at it and when the light comes on, they are to pull the trigger. When the light comes on, some of the gun fires and kills those people. Those that are alive have a momentary break. More bets are placed.The next round, 2 bullets are put in the gun. They do the same thing and more people are killed. They have a break again. Next round, 3 bullets are used. More people are killed and now only five people are left. The next round is the duel. Each sponsor of the respective participants is told to pick a ball that has tin foil wrapped around it. After each sponsor has the ball, they are told to unwrap it. It is revealed that there are two balls that are black. Those two will go to the duel. The other three are free to go with prize money.At the duel, 4 bullets are used. They face each other and spin the cylinder of the gun and they point it at each other's head. When the light comes on they shoot and the son wins. He takes 1.8 million dollars. Afterward, his sponsor offers him a ride to wherever he wants. He does not trust them so he states OK but he wants to go get his stuff first. Using that as a pretext, he makes his escape.While waiting for a train, he is spotted by the police. He hides the money in a trash can. He is taken to the police station and questioned but he tells them only half truths. The police let him go because they have no evidence against him. He goes back and after some searching, finds the money bag. He takes the money and puts it in a United States Postal package with certified receipt, to be mailed to his home. He then calls his mother and tells him to expect a package with some money. She asks him what is wrong but tells her nothing and hangs up. He buys a toy and puts it in the money bag and boards the train. On the train is the sponsor of a participant who lost in the duel. The son rides in an empty car of the train. This sponsor shoots the son and takes the money bag and leaves the train. The son takes the certified receipt and eats it all before he dies. The End.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie seemed like a solid effort to me and I couldn't really understand why so many people seem annoyed by it. The cinematography is good, as are the performances. In terms of pacing, the set up is slow and methodical but all information presented foreshadows and legitimizes character motivation later on. The puzzle piece opening act makes the audience work to gain access into this world as the narrative binds characters together. This intro also conveys a sense of the films central organizing tenet: chance and fate. These characters are not in control of their fate and they are making decisions and perusing courses of action which have the potential to branch off in numerous unforeseen directions. In terms of the central protagonist-whats the problem? He needs money. He comes across an opportunity to get that money. He is young. Young people do rash things because they don't have enough life experienced to make the best decision the time he has become enmeshed int the game its too late. In terms of the resolution, again: whats the problem? This further adheres to ideas concerning fate and chance. The boy survives the bizarrely well organized game of Russian roulette, he manages to evade the police and he even manages to retrieve his money from the garbage bin....but then his luck runs out when he crosses paths with Jason Stratton's character. This seems to ring true. It poses the question: How many lives do we have? How many times can you spin the chamber and hold the gun to your head? This conclusion also brings to mind several engaging noir films which do not end on a high note, yet are satisfying in their own way. Get Carter (the original. Not that Stallone piece of junk), Stanley Kubrick's The killers and even Sunset Boulevard. All of these movies afford us the vicarious thrill of watching characters enter into skewed moral universes. (Much like entering the world of 13). Even more engaging, the implications of the bleak conclusion are clearly in keeping with the overall narrative. The wealthy organizers of the game make it abundantly clear that "no one harms the survivors." this happens twice for emphasis, once with Mickey Rourke's character and then again with the young Central protagonist. The elite rich may bet on your life but they adhere to a code of behavior. They have rules. What are the implications for stratton's character? now that he had breach the code? Seeing stratton's character run down that tunnel in the final shot implies an infinite and unknowable series of events beyond the credits. Much in the same way fate works. Test it out. Take a walk and pay close attention. Although you have preformed notions of what will happen during that walk, there are always unknown variables. Even on the dullest of days. Does everything have to end like The Shawshank Redemption? With a long aerial shot of the central protagonist walking off into the sunset down Mexico way?</fullReview>

The Gun shots scenes are really intense but sadly besides Sam Riley, all the actors in the movie are more famous for their Action rather than Acting Chops. This loose point of the movie can be noticed every where during the intense Gun Shot scenes. Sam Riley &amp; Alexander Skarsgard did a good job. Jason Statham, Mackie Rourke &amp; 50Cents were really weak. Overall, a good time pass movie which does manages to raise your pulse during the Intense Gun Shot Tournament.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I never watched the original version of this film, reading reviews, it seems to have been pretty good. Like with other remake movies, it is unfortunate that much can be lost attempting to recreate or better the original as in this case. The atmosphere in the original helped the storyline and vice-versa. In this version, an atmosphere was never created. It seemed that most of the cast was forced to be part of this hopeless attempt of a remake. Who knows, maybe they were in it just for the money.... The cast list might have been promising but seeing their performance, they could have easily been replaced by a group of amateurs. Can't really blame them though as the script was very poor, the plot was bland and predictable, the point of creating some tension was completely missed, in fact certain scenes, performances and lines were on the verge of comical. The 'subplots' were entirely meaningless. Pathetic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pretty shocked when I watched this movie the first time, almost sickened, but also stuck to the screen (everybody who is gonna watch this will know what I mean when the "real deal" starts). Sadly I never saw the original and so can't really compare but I guess it can't be much better, or rather much more intense. The acting of Riley is simply great, but also Rourke, who more or less plays himself, and Winstone are very good performances. Statham plays actually only a supporting role. Michael Shannon, plays the "referee" excellent and should be mentioned.After I watched this movie now three times, the tension is gone, but I can say, if you don't know whats coming, be brave! My GF could not watch it and called it "we must live in a very sick society that people get the idea for a screenplay like that"! And I agree with that! Nevertheless its maybe a very harsh version of a 'reality show' for the mega-rich...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remake By Same Director? Surely This Isn't A Game Of Chance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly another foreign classic has been taken on by Hollywood and ripped apart. It's a shame as the cast is quite impressive: Mickey Rourke, Ray Winstone, Sam Riley, Jason Statham, David Zayas (looking a bit more menacing here), an awful 50 Cent and the incredible Michael Shannon (fast becoming one of my favourite actors). But with such an engaging story, a respectable cast and with the same director as the original French film, surely they're not taking any chances here? Spin. Aim. Not necessarily survive. 13 Tzameti was a great film for all the right reasons. The story, if you don't know, is about an underground game of Russian Roulette where people bet a lot of money on the outcome. In a weird sequence of events, a young man gets involved without knowing what it is and ends up having to play the game. The first film was a black and white, gritty, disturbing film that was full of suspense and everything that worked about it has sadly floundered in this remake. There's a number of reasons why. Firstly, there is a multiple narrative about some of the other contestants, this means that you lose the personal attachment you have with Riley in the first place. It also means that due to the famous cast, you know who is going to survive and who isn't. The Hollywood sheen where it looks pretty, full of rich colours and takes place in a rich mansion means it loses all it's dirty, hostile and cold surroundings that made the original film feel so awkward to situate yourself in. The build-up to watching the bulb is about 1% of the tension of the original, you honestly didn't know what was going to happen in the first one but in this instance you feel like you do and the tension isn't there at all. Instead it feels like a stupid game where you don't care about anyone. The stories of the other contestants detract from the mood and feel like a complete distraction. Rourke's storyline especially. His little story alongside the painfully unbearable 50 Cent is completely unjustified and a waste of time. Statham and Winstone's brotherly love hasn't been thought out and feels superfluous to say the least. Sam Riley does an okay job as the young innocent player, but his lack of conviction makes you feel like a voyeur rather than being involved. The actual game itself and the gambling techniques were also completely unclear and convoluted with the bulb, once being the main source of tension in the first film, rather being set as a preoccupation. The reason why they had a hanging bulb in the first room is that it was a tiny concrete room, so the only thing there was the bulb hanging down, casting judgement. Whereas here, you can't imagine that blowing each other's brains out around such rich tapestry is ideal for cleaning up. The rest of the acting was awful and even Shannon, as another crazy character, is so OTT that you can't help but feel it's comical. The only saving grace about this film is the Russian Roulette itself but I implore you not to watch this film and go out of your way to watch the original instead, otherwise it will ruin the experience for you completely. You'd think since 2005 Babluani would have become a better director, sadly he hasn't and with The Legacy ( L'héritage ) being his only film made between the original and this one, perhaps he's just out of practise. A film that should never have been remade and is an example that Hollywood should sometimes just leave things alone instead of ruining the experience for everyone. Rating: 3/10</fullReview>

Throughout the whole 97 minuites i was expecting something to happen but nothing really did. The Hollywood cast was wasted on silly parts which needed no acting skills at all.The film tries to give some intensity and suspense but it lasts for about 10 seconds. I think the film could of been about 90 minuites shorter.I found myself extremely disappointed and therefore give it 1 star.If you love rubbish films then watch this because it is just that.I think it is fair to say that this film was just about on par with open water it really is that bad and is one of the worst films i have ever ever ever watched.

		<fullReview>Firstly, I by no means, fancy anything I might write could ever even pretend to compare with those wonderful musings, Dr Yvon's Review, entitled "Dr Yvon rents a movie". Writer-director Géla Babluani remakes his inventive French thriller, 13 Tzameti -- winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in 2006 -- with this direct-to-DVD thriller feature. I was a huge fan of 13 Tzameti. I liked the excitement and story and enjoyed the mix of film styles. 13 is, on the other hand the most boring, self-indulgent piece of cinematic crap I have had the misfortune to sit through. I can see why Babluani edited all this junk out of the first one and how he NEVER could have released them in the opposite order. He spends endless amounts of screen time explaining/showing minutia which you at least hope will be useful later in the film, but ultimately turn out not to be. His trademark style here is a total failure as he's constantly interrupting any chance of building tension or a story to go spend 15 minutes on some point that turns out to just detract from the film. Babluani desperately needs someone to stand over his shoulder and say "NO" when he's in the editing room and decides to keep a scene running a solid 10 minutes longer than it should. If you feel Ridley Scott was obscenely self-indulgent in that travesty of a film Hannibal you will feel worse about 13 as it doesn't even have a saving grace shock you ending that at least made Hannibal a water cooler topic. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dr Yvon's Review is "Spot On", as it were...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I agree completely with Dr Yvon's Review.I notice, too, that on this site 13 is rated 8 stars out of 10. The action was not spectacular nor was the acting. But that is not the reason why critics blasted the movie. It was because of the predictability of the script. The original 13 Tzameti was excellent because it had a degenerate, clandestine world of mental chaos behind closed doors in which men gamble on the lives of others men, and it had a pretty good though not exactly novel revenge story.Sticking to the original script would have given this movie an edge over other regular MTV-like Hostel inspired movies. But this one was still far better than say Martyrs 2 which won out because of curving bullets and a mega budget.Yes the plot holes lacked fizzle, yes Jason Statham was as wooden as usual, and yes it is predictable but as I said worse movies have been hits.....zzzzzzzzzzz.What sorry was I sleeping? Slow impossible film is too slow and impossible. It put me right out. Which isn't normal for the Pangs who create films that make you want to watch to the end even if the material isn't very good. Despite not really caring what happened, I'll try it again on home video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one belongs to the movies that got a great setup and beginning but doesn't even comes to a OK ending. By the time you get to the first scene, you will guess how the story will go on. The title will give up enough information about the plot. Story line isn't perfect. There must be a better way to finish the movie. The behavior of the young character doesn't fit his identity. How does he know what do to at that time? Also the background introduction isn't meaningful. All I was thinking when I watching the beginning is to press the fast-forward key, and it turns out the these info can be introduced in less than 5 mins. But the good thing is you will actually hold your breath when the game is on, even though you're 99% sure what the result is. I think in some scene the actors are overacting. Overall I didn't waster my time but it just isn't a great movie. Partly because the "game" not a new idea/thrilling sell point to me.</fullReview>

So unlike Scorsese he did not have to copy a great story and bring it to the American Screen. So I'm looking forward to the next Géla Movie, now that he is able to access the money, he needs to bring his movies to a brighter audience.

		<shortDescription>Interestingly, with the meaning, with the idea, with psychology.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems not everyone saw the meaning which should have been seen. Not everyone realized that the whole point is not Russian roulette. What genre thriller appeared by chance, look for him there is useless. Someone was waiting for the carrier with Jason Statham. From this confusion, this resentment, this bad reviews...The film "Thirteen" is better than you think. Better than you not think. He's just better.But now about the movie itself, not the misinterpretation around him. I must say that the French version I have not seen, so I'll evaluate the film on the basis of the fact that he was alone and had no brothers. The main plot of the money and nothing but money. Money pushing the main character at first to steal, then to hiding threat uncertainty. Money, money, money. Someone thinks not too much money here. And you answer the question: Do you own them enough? And not much money should you own?But back to the film. The main character (the character of Sam Riley) steals an envelope from one unclean in the case of a man who promises fabulous wealth. He does not know what kind of work that will need to make, he merely carries out the instructions that are contained in this envelope. Pushes it to is the fact that his family has absolutely no money. Family sells home to our hero's father lived. Therefore, the main character needs money, very much needed. Follows on the heels of the police, but Vince, namely the so-called hero of the film, can not escape. For the time being...And then Vince gets into the house, where he learned that he will play. Play in the death. On a lot of money. And no way back. Here begins the psychological part of the film: fear for their lives and fear for the murder of another man. Usually, this game is played criminals: past or present. Usually they are under the drug, but even they can not hide all the fear, is what we see in the film. And our main character, which is not something that does not use drugs, but even refuses to alcohol. Perhaps the pure intelligence allows him so long to stay alive.I will not tell all the moments of this deadly game, because it must be seen and not heard, but Vince comes out of it and the winner receives a substantial fee. Worth mentioning that at the end of killing his brother in a duel of the character Jason Statham (Jasper). Jasper just heartbroken. No, not for my brother! For the lost money! Vince realizes that he is in for it in the hands of this man and he runs out of the house. It it turns out.But the police, which only temporarily lost sight of Vince, once again begins to hunt for him, and Vince hides his money in a garbage tank, when he sees that he could catch. His catch, hear a lie, but, for lack of evidence, let go. And money in the tank anymore... break a bunch of garbage, Vince finds a bag of money. Send them by mail back home, family, and decides to stay a little one, on the one hand, to calm his nerves, on the other, to protect the family from misfortunes.Soon Vince goes home, and in one of the shops to buy toy lamb, a white with black ears, to distinguish it from a friend who wanted so much to his sister. But at the station he sees Jasper. Is to say that chance in this movie too, have a special place. So, a series rencontre on one road heads against two enemies: Vince and Jasper. After a brief conversation on the train Jasper kills Vince, taking... lamb, thinking that the bag of money. End.What conclusion from all this? And the conclusion is very simple: money does not bring goodness, do not bring happiness. For their mistakes, always reckoning. The succession of accidents can lead to anything, you need to think before doing something. We strongly encourage everyone to visit this film! But for that you should not read beyond the first paragraph!Give many explosions, jokes, cool shooting, monsters and zombies. There is nothing of this. But there is a sense, the psychology is the idea. Thanks director Gela Babluani for such a good movie. Also, all those who read this record, too, thanks.</fullReview>

Babluani made good job in Hollywood but this isn't what we wanted to see from him... he made same movie but in colors. Tzameti was great film made in France with Georgian Crew, but Hollywood always makes trash from good movies, I understand why Gela Accsepted for it - It was great experience, it was making movie with stars and etc. but if you are doing something, do it good. when you have great back up. Anyway Gela Babluani is talented Director. We are waiting from him more and more great movies. Also Actors. This wasn't greatest acting from Sam Riley, he was good in "Control" and that is it all he got. Onley good in movie was Michael Shannon. He made fantastic job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello to all,How people can you judge this film, if it has not came out yet??? Most important is that director of previous 13 id still director, i agree who enjoyed old one will enjoy this one much better. Gela is doing this because he wants to show his talent to everyone, is that bad? and from now on he will direct much better with more budget, and i think he deserves it. we all now that great actors wants big money, so Gela does what he has to done earlier . . . From trailer - it fills aura (if you understand my meaning) but unfortunately Could not find original one (english). i think it will be AWESOME!!!thanks for attention.</fullReview>
