		<fullReview>I wish that I could remember the very first time I ever tasted chocolate, or felt a cool breeze, or laughed at a funny joke. I can't, sadly, but if I had to wager, I'd bet that any of those three events felt very similar to my first watching of "Paris.. When It Sizzles." Watching this movie feels like falling in love; sweet and joyful and slightly decadent all at once. It's often given a bad rap, and I can't for the life of me understand why. It's a beautiful, lighthearted romantic comedy, and the chemistry between the incomparable Audrey Hepburn and William Holden is undeniable. I'll admit, "Paris.." is no "Sabrina," another (dare I say perfect) Hepburn/Holden film, but I still feel it deserves a nod as a true classic and as a highlight of the careers of both of its stars. Tony Curtis's cameo is pure comedy, delightful as they come. Make your own decision and see this one for yourself, especially if you are an Audrey fanatic like I am. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must See For Would-Be Writers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a wannabe writer, a writer or simply a fan of movie making or the art of writing, this film is a must see. It's not a perfect film. One wonders at times whether some of the rare serious moments in the movie, or the sugary sweet romance, were poorly written on purpose - but it doesn't matter because it all fits together wonderfully with the parody of bad movie writing, which is what this movie is about. Don't watch this film with anyone who is uncomfortable with unconventional movies, or who is an impatient nitpicker - they won't be happy. The biggest mistake in making this movie was probably the title, which is too misleading and not punchy enough for this genre. Interestingly, Orsen Wells wanted to direct this film but didn't get the job. It would have become a classic under his direction, but as it is now, it's just a silly, lighthearted (mostly), fun, risque, self-indulgent, and even didactic, film about the movie business.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film seems to want to cash in on the genre that was so popular in the 1960s. Before the James Bond movies, anything to do with contemporary Europe in American films was either a musical or a noirish spy film. This movie reflects the big-screen, brightly colored and chock full of designer clothing look that was typical of the 60s. This was a time when movies were struggling to compete with color television, and the films got bigger, splashier, and took us to more and more exotic locations.Paris When It Sizzles is very typical of the movies I remember from that time. It looks very much like the Pink Panther franchise, but it strives to be more sophisticated. I frankly think the direction and editing of the movie drag it down. There are is some very witty dialog ("how funny that we both kept giraffes!"), lots of in-jokes about the movie-making process, two very attractive stars (three if you count Tony Curtis in a supporting role), but it still drags more than it should. Except for Curtis, who is really funny and gets the tongue-in-cheek slant of the film just right, the rest seem to be laboring much too hard. The physical jokes (chase scenes, etc.) are overblown and generally go on too long. The whole look of the film seems heavy-handed when it should have been light and breezy. I have the impression this film was intended as farce, but it's more like that proverbial lead balloon. It's too bad, really. This could have been a lot funnier than it is. Nevertheless, Hepburn looks beautiful and soldiers on gamely, as she always did. Even if she did not enjoy making this movie, as has been reported, you wouldn't suspect it from her performance. She was the right choice for this role, but an actor never knows until she sees the final cut of a movie what it's going to look like. And yeah, I agree, that Dracula thing was pretty awful. Curtis' "Method" actor performance almost makes up for it. And what just what was Noel Coward doing in this picture, anyway? He's about as much of a Hollywood producer as Audrey Hepburn is Xena the Warrior Princess.To really see how surreal farce was done right in the 1960s, I recommend the Beatles' "Help."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paris Sizzles, Bill&amp;Audrey Fizzle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Audrey Hepburn's most acclaimed films from the Fifties, Sabrina, showed her at her best if not her two co-stars, William Holden and Humphrey Bogart. Bogey had left us already, but given what he thought of the film I doubt you could ever have gotten him to co-star again with this Hepburn. Still Holden and she got along and I guess Paramount thought they would team them again.It didn't work out because two things were happening in William Holden's life. He broke up with Capucine before this film started and this was to be his final film under his Paramount contract. Reportedly Holden was drinking heavily and production was suspended while he dried out.According to Tony Curtis's memoirs his unbilled bit in the film was to help pad it out as they got it ready for release. I'll bet that this was the case also for Marlene Dietrich's brief appearance and Noel Coward's small role as Holden's producer.Paris - When It Sizzles was supposed to be a light hearted farcical look at the art of movie script writing. Audrey Hepburn plays a stenographer typist who is hired by Holden to help him out with dictation. As Holden spitballs his ideas out, we see a whole bunch of fantasy sequences with the two of them and Tony Curtis in various proposed scenes from his film The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower.Paris - When It Sizzles was held up in release by Paramount for two years, a sure sign this was going to be a lemon. The critics roasted it and the public stayed away in droves. Fortunately both the stars had better work ahead of them and Holden did end his Paramount contract.It would have been nice had he gone out on something a lot better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that only screenwriters and budding screenwriters will get. You have to have more than a passing interest in the process of writing a screenplay to enjoy the witty satire, wry comedy and not have a lot of the in jokes fly over your head. In that regard the film is brilliant and contains one of William Holden's best performances. Audrey Hepburn too is perfectly cast in the role of his secretary/ultimate partner and is a performance that stands right up there alongside her more celebrated roles in "Charade" and "Breakfast at Tiffany's". One of those films that seems too smart for a general audience. I have watched it over the years too with family and friends only to have them get left behind by the plot and start saying how stupid they thought the picture was. Maybe the best movie about the madness of screen writing ever made. Period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first conscious deconstruction of American movie clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing the trailer for this 1964 film and thinking, like millions of other people, that this would be the natural follow-up to "Charade": same Audrey Hepburn coupled with an older eatablished male star, same Paris setting, same romantic music... It turned out that the audience watching this on the suburban main street cinema in St-Lambert, Quebec, were for the most part dumbfounded. Here was a film about a scriptwriter writing a script and altering the story as he went along in order to fulfill a mercenary obligation to create the most fulfilling, popcorn-selling entertainment possible, spoofing every movie convention in the process, out-Stanley-Donen-ing Donen's "Charade", which was itself an attempt to out-Hitchcock Hitchcock's films. It was brainy, satirical, cynical and the first obvious deconstruction of what makes movies tick. Being a remake of a French 1952 film by Julien Duvivier (scripted by cinema pioneer Henri Jeanson) called "La F?te ? Henriette" made it even more derivative. Being scripted by George Axelrod (of "Manchurian Candidate" fame) made it challenging. Unfortunately, trying to salvage the film itself with the oldest movie cliché of them all - the redemptive power of love - made the happy ending definitely tongue-in-cheek and a tad less than sincere. But then there was so much to fill the viewer's time between the outrageous premise and the outrageous ending, it can be said that the thoughtful film-fan did get more than his money's worth. One of my favourite scenes is near the end, when the hero punches the heroine's boyfriend in public, which triggers a series of imitative violent acts in the impressionable public - including two Parisian kids starting a fight. What better illustration of the power of (American) movie violence to modify its audience's behaviour? So, which is it, silly entertainment or thoughtful thesis about the power of the narrative and of its many accepted conventions? Whatever you think of this film, it is at least partly responsible for the creation of the sixties pull-all-the stops, over-the top satirical-and-socially-conscious school of absurdist comedy which ran the gamut from "Laugh-In" and "The Monkees" on TV to manic but oh-so-hip-for-the-times movies like "Don't Make Waves", "Lord Love A Duck", "Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feeling so Sad", "Candy" and "The Magic Christian".P.S.: It would be very nice if "La F?te ? Henriette" was made available on DVD for comparison purposes. But, like many great French films, it is only available for pillaging, referencing or as the basis for an American remake, but definitely not for viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> Paris When It Sizzles is acharming and delightful little comedy showcasing the absurdist talents of Audrey Hepburn and William Holden. The plot concerns a hardened screenwriter and his young protogee as they rush to meet a deadline on a film script. The plot is indeed thin,but what hangs from it is a scenery chewing delight!The film covers various scenarios of the script each involving the electric Hepburn and Holden in the leads. The humor seems to be a precourser to such fims as Airplane,History Of The World and Naked Gun. In addition to Hepburn and Holden,Noel Coward turns in a very funny cameo as the head of the studio. Witty and elegant as ever,I would have liked to have seen more of him in the film. Over all this film is an underrated delight!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Severely underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie isn't everyone's cup of tea. Hepburn called it her least favorite film. Audiences shunned it. At the time of writing, IMDb gives it a measly 6.0 rating. Nevertheless, it is one of my all-time favorite movies.The problem with this film is that it isn't what everyone seems to be expecting it to be: a mindless romantic comedy. Quite on the contrary: this is a work that I can only compare with "Adaptation". It is a story about how stories actually get written: non-linearly, spasmodically, through much self-doubt and simultaneously excessive (narcissistic, really) introspection. (Although, to be fair, in Hollywood the practice has mostly been to call in a whole bunch of writers to fix up the messes left by writers of earlier drafts, so this is least true of how Hollywood movie scripts get written, but it is true just about everywhere else.) Like "Adaptation", this is a movie that takes the plunge into the mind of the writer as he creates a miniature, constantly shifting and bubbling world for us to visit, only to find a second world inside that first, and probably more where that came from. I don't think that you can appreciate it without having written something yourself, but if you have, then you know the feeling: life mimicking art, mimicking life, mimicking art. Personally, for me, the greatest cameo in this movie isn't the appearance of Tony Curtis or Frank Sinatra, but the fact that in mid-shooting William Holden had to be checked into a rehab clinic. How's that for life and art? Again, like in "Adaptation", the story makes no sense, and, in fact, cannot make any sense. Its what the movie is about. To let us watch and keep our sanity, humor is used abundantly. It is well written wit and quite funny, but it isn't what this movie is about, and taking it to be what the movie is about is perhaps what led to its being so underrated."Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain" says the Wizard of Oz, and as far as box office success goes, he's right. Audiences don't like it when the magician shows how the trick is performed. This movie is a prime example. Another is Schwarzenegger's "Last Action Hero". If you like romantic comedies, you should probably avoid this movie. If you want to see a smart film about the madness of writing, this is a soft introduction to the topic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Paris, the successful alcoholic forty-two years old screenplay writer Richard Benson (William Holden) has three days to write a script to his producer that has paid in advance. The typist Gabrielle Simpson (Audrey Hepburn) arrives to his hotel to type the screenplay. Along the three days, she helps him to develop the story and they fall in love for each other."Paris ? When It Sizzles" is absolutely silly and naive, but also charming and delightful and only works because of the chemistry between the gorgeous Audrey Hepburn and the ironic William Holden. There are many jokes with the cinema, with many stories within the lead story, and the most hilarious scenes have the uncredited participation of Tony Curtis. Marlene Dietrich and Mel Ferrer have also uncredited participation. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Quando Paris Alucina" ("When Paris Gets Crazy")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>L'ete a Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even with the glorious views of the City of Light as the background, no one could have saved a movie that went through a disastrous production. It is well known that William Holden had to go into rehab because of his drinking binges while working on the picture. It didn't help either that George Axelrod, the screen writer, was trying to translate the far superior model, Julien Duvivier's "La fete a Henriette", which served as the model for this picture.Paramount had a terrible time trying to release a film that didn't make much sense, because the story just doesn't hold the viewer's interest. To add to that, the story is full of inside jokes of the movie industry, something that was not intended for the public at large. Richard Quine, the director must have gone through a rough period with delays and the frustrations that went along.The only thing to hold our attention is the lovely Audrey Hepburn, clad in her signature Givenchy clothes. As a young secretary, we must do a stretch of our imagination just to reconcile the idea that Gabrielle Simpson could have been able to get all those marvelous costumes from a famous designer with her salary. For all we know there must have been a Parisian branch of Loehmann's, even in those days!! Ms. Hepburn merits all the credit for staying focused and sober throughout the production because the shenanigans of her co-star could have driven anyone to drink! William Holden was a good actor with a big sobriety problem. When he was good, he was excellent, but alas, no one could have been able to convince him to give his best to this movie. Tony Curtis has a brief role, and is quite good. Marlene Dietrich has a cameo where she exudes class and sophistication. Noel Coward doesn't have much to do, as the producer of the fictional movie being written.The cinematography of Charles Lang was one of the best assets in the film. Nelson Riddle, a giant in music composed the score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just say it. It's metanarrative.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have yet to find a synopsis of this film that actually says what it's about, mostly because the films' synopses seem to be trying to desperately avoid that all-dangerously pretentious word: "metanarrative." "Paris When it Sizzles" is about a blocked-up writer (William Holden) who hires an assistant (Audrey Hepburn) to help him come up with a generic movie two days before it's due. The movie itself is concerned with getting Holden and Hepburn together... it not only makes that point clear, it even says it in the dialog... twice. They, in fact, are all-to-ready, saturating the screen with charisma and chemistry from the moment they both enter the story. Meanwhile, the movie goes on a tongue-in-cheek escapade through narrative conventions and winking asides to avant-garde cinema (especially New Wave, as, well, this came out in the time of New Wave), displaying a range of wit and resourcefulness that helps stretch the desire to see Holden and Hepburn kiss to, say, 130-odd pages? I think what makes this movie really fun is the self-conscious dialog in the movie-within-a-movie scenes, especially such lines as, "You're only 3rd Policeman, you aren't even supposed to talk!" and the constant (and yet never stale) repetition of the whole Phillipe-Maurice dichotomy. Most of what keeps the whole thing working and not devolving into too much self-consciousness (always a problem with metanarrative) is its pacing (not hectic, but definitely energetic) and its well-stated love of everything that its making fun of.This movie does seem to have fallen out of prominence. It's available, but not mentioned too often, and definitely not on the top of any lists. However, I hardly see a reason not to watch it, as it's witty, fun, romantic, and enjoyable.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interesting summary? I haven't seen many films that include people making a film, where the ideas that come out of the making of the film, go into making the actual film. Come to think of it, I don't believe I've seen any kinds of films like that.This is a fun movie. It's a fun movie because Holden and Hepburn make it so. It's a sound plot idea, but could have had so many outs into being terrible with the wrong people acting in it, but the whimsical nature of both stars here make it an entertaining romp through Paris.And I do believe it's one of Hepburn's more underrated movies. She's as fantastically drawing here as any of her other roles. One of the only actresses that I can remember in my history of movies that you end up just ogling on the screen, your eyes never leave her, because she makes you feel everything she's going through so well, that it's effortless.A great movie to sit at home and watch on a lazy summer Sunday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mid-60's Comedy/Satire About Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paris When It Sizzles (1964): Audrey Hepburn, William Holden, Tony Curtis, Mel Ferrer, Marline Dietrich,Gregoire Aslan, Michel Thomas, Raymond Bussieres, Christian Duvaleix, Noel Coward, Dominique Boschero, Evi Marandi. Director Richard Quine...Screenplay George Axelrod, Julien Duvivier, Henry Jeanson.Little did Director Richard Quine know that his 1964 comedy "Paris When It Sizzles" would actually pave the way for later, more developed and expressive comedies satirizing the world of Hollywood, namely screen writing. For instance, 2002's "Adaptation" starring Nicholas Cage and Meryl Streep was a cleverly constructed satire on screen writing. William Holden, in his fifties, a compulsive alcohol drinker, past his prime and in the declining phase of his career portrays the protagonist. He is Richard Benson, a soave screenwriter for a Hollywood studio, living in Paris and supposedly working on a screenplay for a film that must be made in a short amount of time. Desperate for help, he hires a typist, Gabrielle Simpson (Audrey Hepburn). The two of them combine their creative talents to write a successful, mainstream action thriller "The Girl Who Stole The Eiffel Tower" , put themselves in the roles of the lead characters and in the process, fall in love with each other. The whole film, the script owing to the genius of George Axelrod, is itself a living screenplay that we get to see come to life. Reality and fantasy are mixed up and before long, we are caught up in the adventure in much the same way one would in those old "Choose Your Own Adventure" books. Rick and Gaby are each other's antagonist at first, both of them involved in a dangerous game of good guys versus bad guys, something about protecting a powerful secret from the wrong hands or the wrong politics. But before long, Rick and Gaby fall in love and after many plot twists, the film concludes in the most conventional manner for a film - the bad boy is redeemed through a girl's love but he dies because his dangerous lifestyle has caught up with him. Audrey Hepburn turns on her charm as usual. Always beautifully dressed, still a beautiful woman despite being older, intelligent, charismatic and a fine actress. This role was quite the stray from the previous "serious" roles she had undertaken at the start of the 60's - Holly Golightly in "Breakfast At Tiffany's" and Eliza Dolittle in "My Fair Lady", coincidentally both films are alluded to in this movie. As Gabrielle/Gaby, Audrey is clearly having fun and not doing anything truly challenging. There is genuine chemistry between Holden and Hepburn, this owing to the fact that they had been involved during the filming of "Sabrina" in the mid-50's. Hepburn decided Holden was not husband material and dumped him. Ten years later, they reunite to portray lovers in this film, and it works. They even look great together. This is a well-written, lively comedy that is unfortunately very old-fashioned by today's standards for comedy. At the time of its release, it was fresh and new stuff, so that all the little touches like Frank Sinatra's voice for the song "The Girl Who Stole The Eiffel Tower", the sudden cameos by Tony Curtis and Marlene Dietrich and the witty remarks by everyone (i.e. "You can't talk, you're only Policeman No. 2") and the words "Kiss..The End..Fade Out", were all new to audiences at the time. This is a fun comedy that satirizes Hollywood films and still maintains its dignity and charm. A must see for fans of Audrey Hepburn and William Holden.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so it's not the best movie in the world, but I think William Holden was at his best in this movie. This was the first time I remember him in a role, and was he fabulous (and sexy! I dreamed of him for weeks after my first viewing -- and I'm 27)! Loved that they were putting themselves into the romance as they were writing it, and she kept changing his scenes, putting him in a roguish light -- loved him with the green light when he was a vampire. And Tony Curtis was perfect while mocking himself and his image. Everyone in the film looked like they were enjoying making it -- don't know if that's true, because Audrey and William had had a bad breakup years earlier, but their chemistry was undeniable. (Although I didn't believe she was as young as her character was supposed to be. And, frankly, it was annoying that she played at 20something when she was clearly older than that.) An entertaining movie I would love to own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Hepburn?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paris WHEN IT SIZZLES is an attempt to cash-in on the popularity of Audrey Hepburn, the heart-winning starlet who rose to fame in a series of light romantic comedies in the 1950s and 1960s. This one's a steamy, silly tale of love and fantasy in Paris, with Hepburn assisting a past his prime screenwriter (William Holden) with his latest masterpiece.Unfortunately this is one of the worst Hepburn films I've sat through, as it really is a chore to watch in places. The whole story is slight and silly, with lots of unbelievable and twee scenes. The structure of the thing is scattershot and the regular fantasy set-pieces are hardly successful. One of the worst things about it is the acting, with Holden failing to fulfil the criteria of a romantic lead and Hepburn coming across as nothing more than a bad actress.Perhaps fearing they had a dud on their hands, producers throw a number of extra stars into the mix - Tony Curtis, Noel Coward, etc. - but they fail to make much of an impact, leaving Paris WHEN IT SIZZLES one of the flimsiest and most unsatisfying of all Hepburn movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Original &amp; Energetic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read most of the other reviews here for this film I was surprised to find that I took something quite different from the viewing than what everyone else seems to have. Most people describe it as a satirical look at movie/script writing with the two main actors falling in love after a great deal of hammy acting, and I guess this is a fair comment, but it is my opinion that most people have missed something that begins the moment Hepburn enters the room. Holden's character is immediately attracted to her, and while her own feelings may not be so readily apparent, she is soon swept up by his energy as he whirls around the room throwing papers all about, and her fascination with him becomes clear when she allows herself to be kissed within 5 minutes of having entered his apartment. It was this moment that tipped me off as to what the film was going to be all about, and from then on I found it to be utterly charming and quite hilarious. His writing becomes immediately hampered by the fact that his attraction to her overtakes his thoughts and she becomes the centre of his narrative, and he like-wise becomes the heroic male figure that he imagines she should fall in love with. With this in mind and Hepburn's fascination with his charm and energy, the jumping and changing of scenes within the narrative becomes hilarious, and it is obvious that this smitten pair will not be coming up with anything worthwhile any time soon. Holden's jealousy over Hepburn's mention of her boyfriend results in him imagining the mystery man to be a complete lame duck, and when he portrays him as such in the narrative, Hepburn's attraction to the presumptuous Holden shows in her supplying feeble protest to the verbal attack. Eventually they are both so taken with each other that their attempts to portray any serious moments within the narrative become saturated by their own feelings, and this only serves to raise the level of humour. Towards the latter half of the film there are some absurd and over-the-top moments, but this is understandable when taking into account that neither of them is concentrating properly. I felt the treatment of the real-life boyfriend by both Hepburn and Holden at the end was a little harsh, and the public fight scene that followed a little too silly, but this did not detract too much overall, and by the time the closing credits came up I felt that I had watched a highly original, clever and immensely enjoyable love story / comedy. I give "Paris...When It Sizzles" 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a small cast, and is only worth a good mark already for the acting performance of Holden and Hepburn. Without these two and the comical, but very over-acted, appearance of Curtis the movie would surely be lost in its poor story. The satirical part is mainly in the beginning of the movie and the plot is more and more gone in the end. But the movie is worth watching: an excellent and beautiful Hepburn is at her most charming and Holden is giving her good support. The story develops mainly around the two main characters who hardly leave their apartment(s). There are some nice switches in the plot but the end is weak and quite predictable. On the other hand it is a good movie that does not want you to do much more than watch and relax on a calm evening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful plot, I love Audrey Hepburn!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised recently when seeing this film with family and friends to find that none of them enjoyed or appreciated it - to them it was hard to follow and seemed to have no point. I agree that this is a movie which could seem confusing to the casual viewer. The parallel plots that unravel bit by bit are definitely not what we are most used to seeing now in the days of action-packed thrillers where the excitement never stops. However, the sophisticated movie-lover will appreciate the refreshing creativity with which the plots are handled, and will recognise that the two stories are really one in idea and development. This is the most enjoyable romantic comedy I have had the pleasure to see in a long while! There is something to be said for old movies. Also -- I can't get enough of AUDREY HEPBURN!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Witty, brilliant script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie. It is definitely an underrated classic. I don't watch it because I particularly enjoy the storyline or the cinematography. In fact, some of the parts, i don't really enjoy much at all (ie. when William Holden is a vampire in the caves... I understand that it's a side-story developing in the head of the drunken Audrey Hepburn, but it seemed to take away from the movie a bit). But I came into this movie, expecting very little. A friend, also a movie buff, had told me that this movie wasn't all that great. So I didn't expect much. Frankly, I only watched it out of love for Audrey Hepburn. I've watched Sabrina a million times, and watched how Hepburn and Holden interact with one another. Seeing the two as the actual lead couple was pretty fun. I think the acting is pretty great. But above all, this movie contains one of the best, funniest, wittiest scripts I have ever come across. I love how the lines are worded perfectly, and I would find myself actually laughing out loud at the scenes, even when I'm watching it all by myself! If you're looking for a movie with a smart script, here is one for you. Don't let it pass by without a glance. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This self-conscious tale about a screenwriter and his assistant might be a little skinny on plot, but it's wink-included self-consciousness feels surprisingly modern. As it stands, "Paris When it Sizzles" is an unrecognized godfather to movies like "Spaceballs" (think "dissolves") and "The Naked Gun," where everyone seems in on the fact that a movie is on screen, and not reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie may have not scored that high with the critics, but I loved it. As the duo rejoins (Audrey Hepburn and William Holden) in this light comedy about a drunken writer (Holden) and his secretary (Hepburn), they sparkle and shine all over Paris! What more can I say? The script is funny, the characters are full of pizazz, and even though the story line is a little odd, it is still good for laughs. While Richard Benson (Holden) has spent his 15 and a fraction weeks drinking bloody mary's and going to bull fights and Madrid , his anxious producer Alexander Mayerheim is awaiting his script for "The Girl Who Stole the Eiffell Tower". Richard then hires Gabrielle Simpson (Hepburn) to help him finish the script in two days. They act out the scenes to write them down, ending a hilarious mishap of what-ifs. Romance blossoms between the two, and if you are an Audrey Hepburn or William Holden fan, you'll love the movie. I bought it because I liked Audrey Hepburn, and I laughed so hard that I cried in some of the scenes. Notice the cameos of her husband Mel Ferrer (though I can't figure out which one he was) and Tony Curtis and Marlana Deitrich. Excellent movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Holden and Audrey Hepburn star in "Paris When it Sizzles," a 1964 comedy also starring Tony Curtis and Noel Coward, with a cameo by Marlene Dietrich and part of a song courtesy of Frank Sinatra. Director Richard Quine had a great deal of trouble on this movie due to the constant drunkenness of William Holden. Holden was unable to work on many days. In the middle of filming, he had to go to a rehabilitation clinic. Quine improvised, bringing in whomever and whatever he could to make the movie. A good deal of it is actually Holden doing a narration, giving the impression that he did more than he actually did."Paris When It Sizzles" is the story of a screenwriter (Holden) who has wasted nearly six months in Paris spending a producer's money but has no script to show for it. Now the script is due. He hires a secretary named Gaby (Hepburn) to type it; he works on all kinds of scenarios, at first using different characters but ultimately "starring" himself and Gaby. This is a great premise for a plot, and some of it works very well, but in the end, it doesn't really hang together. There are lots of "in" jokes - references to "My Fair Lady" and "Breakfast at Tiffany's," for instance, and jokes that screenwriters and actors will love, too. One of the worst parts of the film, the "Dracula" scenario, fortunately had to be shortened because William Holden smashed his new Ferrari into a wall and wound up in a splint.Holden and Hepburn are very good, and Tony Curtis has a great part as a "method" actor who appears in the film scenarios in different roles. He's extremely funny. Noel Coward is an odd choice for a producer.For a movie beset by so many difficulties, "Paris When It Sizzles" came out okay. As a vehicle for stars of the magnitude of Holden and Hepburn, it's not as good as it should be; and given the star that Tony Curtis was in 1964, his small part draws attention to how slapped together the film is. Not great, but not as bad as it could have been, probably due to the fact that Richard Quine was a talented director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hepburn - When she Sizzles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had stayed away from this film because so many people had said negative things about it. The reviews are often scathing and refer to it as 'lame'. When I finally got to see it, I realised that most people do not get the satire and the witty send-up of screen writing and movies. William Holden gives a memorable performance as the script writer and Audrey Hepburn positively sizzles as the typist proving that she could hold her own against any leading man. I loved the in-jokes (Mel Ferrer in an uncredited cameo, Marlene Dietrich and Christian Dior, Noel Coward camping it up, Tony Curtis sending himself up etc, etc). This film is memorable because it sends up movies, and the process of making movies. It has countless movie references from "Funny Face" to "Casablanca" and for anyone who considers themselves a movie-buff, this is a must. For the average movie goer, this film may seem fragmented and slow but once you are in on the joke, it is pure movie magic. Audrey, we miss you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once critically panned, now some kind of classic, at least in the eyes of Audrey Hepburn fans and fashion aficionados (you know who you are), "Paris When It Sizzles" is one of many sparkly mid 60s romantic comedies (see "Charade"), all of which attempted to rekindle a certain old, Hollywood glamour.Hepburn, who was some kind of style icon at the time, finds herself paired with William Holden. He's a playboy screenwriter who has but a matter of hours to start and finish a screenplay. In this regard he enlists the help of Hepburn, who plays a temp secretary hired by Holden to hastily transcribe his script.This is where the film's big gimmick kicks in: it's structured as a film within a film, Hepburn and Holden desperately acting out a series of madcap, improvisational scenes for Holden's hurriedly unfolding screenplay. Much of the film then becomes a satire of Hollywood conventions and various movie clichés. Elsewhere the film homages fare like "Cleopatra", Chaplin movies, "Jekyll and Hyde", "Casabalanca", "Dracula", "Frankentein" etc. Back then this was new stuff. Now, not so much.Holden and Hepburn's banter oscillates from "pleasantly witty" to "Euthenasia, now!". It's the kind of film for which the adjectives "off the wall", "giddy", "delightful" and "charming" were invented, but may also provoke nausea in those with an aversion to Hepburn. During this period she made a number of films set in Paris ("Sabrina", "Love in the Afternoon", "Funny Face", "Charade", "How to Steal a Million") and was generally marketed as both a style icon and purveyor of European glamour. Is she still? I don't know. Today's fad is usually tomorrow's joke.7.9/10 - Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This picture was widely panned (see Barry Paris' bio of Audrey), but I think the critics were looking at the film too narrowly. I saw it for the first time about a month ago, and my basic impression was that God is in his heaven and all is well in the motion picture business (at least in 1962 when this picture was made).Much has been written about Audrey, who did the movie because she owed Paramont one more picture, even though she was nervous about appearing again with her former paramour, Holden.I especially liked Noel Coward, and not much has been said about him. Coward wrote hundreds of screen plays in addition to doing some acting. In his final scene (with Holden) - the grotesque edifice one - I am not sure he was acting. It seemed too real.Anyway, it ended when those two highly paid heads came together for that ultimate, final, and inevitable, studio-rent paying, theater-filling, popcorn-selling, kiss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seems I'm in the minority for liking this little gem. I have a feeling that since Hepburn said it was one of her least favorite films, people fail to look beyond that at what a clever little piece this is. Or it may take an appreciation of cinema itself. To me, this was way before its time. It makes fun of the system, writers, and actors. Some of the film is very stupid or silly, but that's the point. They are writing a BAD film, and as such, we see this bad film come to life. It's also a great spoof. Tony Curtis, in a very extended cameo plays himself. But himself as an actor in a supporting role. It's hard to describe the brilliance of this performance. From his initial entrance with the exaggerated mannerisms of a method actor, to his delivery of lines usually reserved for insignificant extras. It does become tedious in spots, and Holden and Hepburn's romance is just as forced and sudden as the one in their poorly written movie. See this if you are a Curtis fan, or love seeing actors lampoon themselves. I'm surprised to see so much post-modernism so early on in cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A major misfire...and tedious to boot!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1964, Audrey Hepburn and William Holden were among the very top movie stars in the world. Because of this and their excellent track records, you would expect "Paris When It Sizzles" to be a very good if not a great film. Well, this would be a mistake, as even though the film featured these two likable and bankable stars, it's a terrible movie--a complete misfire and a waste of their talents as well as Tony Curtis' and Mel Ferrer's (Hepburn's husband at the time)--who appear in a few short cameos. I have no idea if the film lost money, though I am pretty sure it must have. It also, according to IMDb, was Audrey Hepburn's least favorite among her films.William Holden plays an alcoholic* playboy who occasionally takes time off from this busy schedule to write a film here or there. He's been under the gun to stop his partying and get to work when he hires a new secretary (Audrey Hepburn). Most of the rest of the picture consists of the pair talking out the plot to a particularly stupid film. And, as they talk, you see the pair acting out the film as if they are the stars. You also see that despite Holden's best efforts, they fall in love."Paris When It Sizzles" sure has the look of a vanity project. The film is way too cute and self-aware. And, if he love the joke or are a die-hard Hepburn fan (and there are some who simply cannot accept that this actress EVER made a bad film), then you'll probably like the film. But the end results are not particularly convincing and the film that the pair talk about throughout the film is just plain stupid. Overall, the film comes off as boring inside joke.*This is a sad case of art imitating life, as Holden was rather notorious for his heavy drinking that appears to have helped put him in an early grave. This seems to a rather bad inside joke--referring to his drinking problems (which, according to IMDb, were severe enough to force him into rehab just before the actual filming was complete).</fullReview>

Audrey is lovely as ever, but I'm sure she wondered why she signed onto this. Holden does his best, (Holden as Dracula???!!!)but it shows that he had problems during the production, mainly, having to work with Hepburn again after their affair during Sabrina. If you're a rabid fan of Holden, like I am, you must check it out, anyhow. He made a few that were worse, but he has so many that are better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing sizzles in this woodenly frenetic picture, a remake of 1952's "La F?te ? Henriette". It's a "madcap" comedy ten years passed its time, reuniting Audrey Hepburn and William Holden from "Sabrina" but giving them nothing to do but flail away at silly routines. Poorly directed by the uneven Richard Quine, the movie suffers from too little story and heavy-handed over-production. A screenwriter and his assistant 'visualize' ideas for his next project, which gives the filmmakers an excuse to run rampant with star-cameos, costume changes galore and wacky slapstick. Audrey Hepburn is far too refined (and too sane a star-presence) to be convincing doing screwball comedy; her screws have always been very tight, and it's not in her to be daffy (her Holly Golightly in "Breakfast at Tiffany's" was a kook, but a sharp one). Hepburn and Holden still look great, but by this time they were too mature to be dashing about like kids. The production is plush, but the script needed a complete overhaul. What a waste! * from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The creative process is never simple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given two days to finish a screenplay that he has supposedly been writing for months but has actually not yet started, a washed up screenwriter enlists the help of an imaginative young stenographer in this comedy vehicle for 'Sabrina' alumni William Holden and Audrey Hepburn. While a predictable eventual romance between the pair adds very little to the story, it is delightful to have the Oscar winning stars back together with equally as much chemistry a decade on. As the plot furthermore consists of both leads imagining and reinventing (as they go along) what the screenwriter's movie will eventually look like, ambition is in no short supply here. The results are not, however, entirely successful. Amusing as all the reversed footage is as they change their mind about scenes - and as curious as some of their deflections are as they wonder how the film could be turned into everything from a heist comedy to a vampire horror flick - there is absolutely no escaping how tepid the film within the film eventually ends up being. The characters of the film-within have no character and the plot does not really make sense. One might, however, argue this as intentional on behalf of the actual filmmakers, George Axelrod and Richard Quine, who (intentionally or not) prove that it is impossible to write a lucid one-and-a-half hour film in less than 48 hours! Whatever the case, the film is an interesting celebration of the human creative process and some hilarious cameos by Marlene Dietrich and Tony Curtis in a glorified "bit part" do not hurt at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Drizzle Than Sizzle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Richard Quine's "Paris When It Sizzles" proves that Audrey Hepburn could and did make some disastrous movies before her career when into decline in the 1970s. Presumably, Paramount Pictures must have thought that pairing superstars William Holden with Audrey Hepburn again after they had appeared in "Sabrina" with Humphrey Bogart constituted a surefire sensation. Despite all the considerable talent and production values that went into this romantic comedy with its scenic setting, "Paris When It Sizzles" never sizzles. Indeed, Holden and Hepburn ignite the screen with undeniable chemistry as a film scriptwriter suffering from writer's block who falls in love with his stenographer. One of the elements of a memorable movie is the ability of the filmmakers to spring one surprise after another so that we the audience don't tire of the screenplay shenanigans. In this regard, "Paris When It Sizzles" does sizzle. Unfortunately, "Breakfast at Tiffany's" scenarist George Axelrod wears out the idea about a scribe who keeps changing a screenplay that he has been contracted to write so that every quarter-hour or so, the plot changes until the fun fizzles. During all these bright, fun-loving antics, Tony Curtis, Mel Ferrer, and Marlene Dietrich make cameo appearances. Reportedly, Curtis stepped into the film as a favor. If you blink, you may miss Dietrich.Movie producer Alexander Meyerheim (famous playwright Noel Coward) is luxuriating in the South of France while his contract writer, Richard Benson (William Holden), sits in Paris trying to write a script. The problem is that Benson isn't having any luck with his literary endeavors until beautiful Gabrielle Simpson (Audrey Hepburn) enters his life as his stenographer. Benson makes just enough progress with his screenplay to realize how awful that it is before he sets about constantly revising it and conjuring up every cliché in the book. Meanwhile, Meyerheim has deluded himself into believing that Benson has created another cinematic gem. In fact, after all his elaborate but contrived ideas, Benson concocts a script that is so egregious that he tosses it at fadeout so he can kiss Gabby and they can dissolve into Paris after dark. If you know little about the process of writing a screenplay, this frivolous comedy should prove enlightening.Nothing about "Paris When It Sizzles" is remotely memorable. At various points, it looks like both Quine and Axelrod realized that they were roasting a turkey. Some of the crisp, crackling dialogue serves as a commentary about the futility of what they were trying to achieve. This carefree farce struggles throughout its overlong 110 minutes to conjure up laughs as well as insights. The chief insight is that when things go awry not even first-class talent that compensate for it. Nothing works, and the narrative about a fictional movie entitled "The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower" looks like a combination of "Casablanca" crossed with "Algiers." Happily, Hepburn relies on her charm and survives this travesty. Holden, on the contrary, doesn't fare as well as Hepburn. William Holden delivers the hammiest performance of his distinguished career. Mind you, "Paris When It Sizzles" is almost worth watching so you can see Holden decked out in one scene as a vampire! He resembles a Lon Chaney, Jr., with a hangover in that brief scene that must have been embarrassing for the Oscar-winning actor. "Paris When It Sizzles" has more drizzle than sizzle. Skip it unless you are a die-hard fan of either William Holden or Audrey Hepburn. The scene when they compare "My Fair Lady" (a film that Hepburn is remembered for) with "Frankenstein" merely shows that sophistication and wit cannot save the day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A few weeks ago I had an idea to give up drinking, but it didn't photograph"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1954, William Holden and Audrey Hepburn lit up the screen in Billy Wilder's 'Sabrina (1954),' though certain narrative requirements stipulated that the latter must instead end up in the arms of a certain other grizzled Hollywood star. 'Paris When It Sizzles (1964)' was the pair's second and final teaming, and it's a light, breezy and likable enough romantic comedy, with a nice concept but a rather lazy screenplay. I've always enjoyed exploring the notion that an author (or a screenwriter, in this case) is virtually a god with respect to his own story, able to direct his characters' every action and impulse, and to alter and even reverse reality if he feels the tale requires it. This is exactly what Richard Benson (Holden) and Gabrielle Simpson (Hepburn) do during two warm days in Paris ? they explore their own romantic connection indirectly through their screenplay, and, each time the relationship turns sour, they are able to permanently reverse the action and start out fresh; this is a luxury that real-life can never afford us.There's a spontaneity to the screen writing process that I liked. When the story suddenly reverts to the tired cliché of government agents in trench-coats, Benson hastily condemns his lack of originality and rolls back the plot. When the story is in need of a handsome but arrogant male suitor, they postulate somebody like Tony Curtis ? and, behold, Tony Curtis arrives on a scooter to fill the part! All this reminded me strongly of a short film that I wrote and directed several years ago, age 16, about a failed novelist trying unsuccessfully to compose his masterpiece, constantly revising and rewriting until the story takes on a life of its own. Unfortunately, the terrific concept of 'Paris When It Sizzles' eventually runs out of steam, and "The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower" soon becomes a trite and cheesy crime caper, of the sort that only the 1960s could have produced. What might have been a clever, witty and insightful dissection of human relationships (and the artificiality of Hollywood romance), instead retires as an agreeable but insubstantial light comedy.The screenplay for 'Paris When It Sizzles' was written by George Axelrod, who also co-penned my least favourite Billy Wilder film, 'The Seven Year Itch (1955).' There is some good-natured banter concerning the true nature of Hollywood film-making (did you know that "Frankenstein" and "My Fair Lady" are effectively the same story?), but otherwise the dialogue is fairly forgettable, and doesn't move the story anywhere. Some Wilder witticisms in this film, certainly, could not have gone amiss! Holden and Hepburn are, predictably, charming and likable, sharing a chemistry that suggests both stars had a lot of fun during filming. There's always enjoyment to be derived from harassing Tony Curtis (by getting his character's name wrong, and then constantly reminding him that he's playing an insignificant bit part). However, in the film's second half, he's obviously being used as padding to compensate for the absence of William Holden, who was then undergoing treatment for alcoholism. Overall, this picture doesn't quite sizzle, but it'll nonetheless provide enough heat to warm your hands.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond stupid. A waste of time. Avoid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what movie the other reviewers were watching, but it's hard to believe that it's the same film I saw. Yes, Audrey Hepburn is lovely; that's worth one star. Chemistry between her and William Holden? I didn't see it. Forget the fact that the inner narrative (the script of "The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower") makes no sense - OK, that's the point. But the outer narrative is little better. It's impossible to believe that Gabrielle would allow Richard to become so familiar, so quickly - despite his supposedly smooth approach that allegedly sets her on her ear. I could barely make it through this mess. It's just too bad that the camera negative and the only work print weren't stolen and burned, thereby sparing us this sorry spectacle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paris When it Fizzles- This Sizzler A Dud *</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other than having Bill Holden and Audrey Hepburn in this film, the only good thing about it is the last 10-15 minutes when reality sets in.If I remember correctly, Holden lost Hepburn to "brother" Humphrey Bogart in the 1954 marvelous film "Sabrina." Was this supposed to be a consolation for Bill getting Audrey 10 years later?Audrey as a typist goes to work for screenwriter Holden. The latter comes up with one of the stupidest ideas for a movie entitled "The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower." The stupidity becomes even worse when Holden and Hepburn act out the inane silliness associated with this nonsense.Cameos by Noel Coward and Tony Curtis, the latter constantly told that he is less than a supporting player here, can't even help this film. There is even a one scene walk-on by Marlene Dietrich.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Paris When It Sizzles" reunites Audrey Hepburn and William Holden, but this film is no "Sabrina". It's not even close. The story pits raconteur screenwriter Holden against a fast approaching deadline. The screenplay is due within days, and he has no plot, characters, or dialogue. (It's kind of like the movie itself). But in pops perky Hepburn as his temporary secretary to set things right. Just like a Gallic Mary Poppins. She becomes his muse, and lover. Sadly the dialogue is a disaster, the story, as little as there is, has no drama, nor humor, nor romance, and the direction is aimless. As an Audrey Hepburn fan, I could weep. Definitely, give this one a pass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think William Holden is one the greatest actors ever. I am an Audrey Hepburn fan. And I am pretty easy to please if offered some light harmless entertainment even if without a masterpiece tag attached. So I was ready to like this when I first watched it. But "Paris when it sizzles" is, in my opinion, one of the worst films ever. It has no redeeming features, and not even watching two of your favourite actors seems to make it any better. They could not have done much to enliven those flat empty characters they play. The film tries to be referential and funny and it is repetitive and boring. The songs and choreographers are a nag, the story ridiculous, the insider jokes simply not funny. The only thing to add some interest are some of the cool crisp suits Audrey gets to model. Otherwise, this senseless story drags and drags into absolute boredom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of Audrey Hepburn, I was quite interested in seeing this film. While Paris When it Sizzles is not without its charms, it sort of disappointed me. The film does benefit from some gorgeous locations and beautiful cinematography, while the music was a nice touch too. What makes the movie watchable is the cast. Audrey Hepburn has been better, but she is very graceful and charming in this movie and brings some vigour into the movie when it most needs it. William Holden is also great, the film is worth seeing for his chest, if I were to say it is a scene stealer it would be an understatement. And Tony Curtis is delightful, he always is a welcome presence and this is no exception, he has the film's funniest moments. I quite liked Marlene Dietrich's cameo too.However, Paris When it Sizzles does suffer from some problems. To be honest, I wasn't a fan of the title, after seeing the movie I thought it was misleading and lacked punch. The pacing is rather leaden here, while the direction is on the mediocre side of things. The script had its witty moments but it was often unfunny and weak, while the story is rather thin and predictable and the slower scenes and romantic moments are somewhat sappily written. The ending also falls flat, to be honest I was not surprised by the outcome and some scenes leading up to it were done in a sadly heavy-handed way. Finally, while it looked pretty and had a great cast, overall there wasn't any real fire and passion here.So overall, had great potential but fizzles out. 5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an interesting study case:As a film, it's hardly any good. Simple direction, ordinary editing, nothing relevant, it's a product of old times, but worse than others that created and followed its model.As entertainment, it lost the value that it might have had in its day. And that's not specially bad about this specific film. Romantic comedy has to be the genre that gets outdated more easily, because it deals with very dated needs and demands of the audiences. So, this film is as outdated today, as any of our days' romantic comedies will be in 50 years.The acting by the main actors is tolerable even though we saw Hepburn, Holden and Curtis do better in many of their other films. And although this is not so well suited to Audrey's character, we still have her class, the most remarkable in filmdom.But something makes this film a remarkable and unique piece that you will eventually have to see if you care about cinema and shift the french printed on it at the beginning of the 60'. So here we have a film literally about film writing. From the very beginning we are allowed to know that we will be watching a film which is making itself, inventing as it goes along. Naturally the main characters had to be a writer, and a typist, who unwillingly becomes a writer as well. We have two levels: that of the reality of the hotel room in Paris, which already is ostensibly artificial (that's why Holden says he had the Eiffel tower placed so he'd know he was in Paris) and the level of the film within, a provisional reality, constantly changing, and affected by what goes on in the room. This constant changes in the film within would provide the entertainment part here (Tony Curtis acts to be funny, and he is).But where things really become interesting is in the french connection: there are a lot of explicit references to the new wave that was hitting Paris and french cinema those days. Those references were always mockery, things about how in those new films "nothing happens". And we get this film as the opposite of that, a feast to the eye, where the narrative is filled with events, regardless how silly they sound, even in the context of the film, and even in the context of the film within! What we have is the old fashioned way, and that's assumed. And the battle field is Paris, at once the stage of the new wave, where deep changes take place, and one of the most cherished locations of the "old days", one the most used places in the history of film, with all its iconic places, charged with symbolism in the post-war American cinema. That's what's at stake here: the rise of new paradigms, that threatened what "american cinema" for the masses meant back than. That's why the provisional title for the film within was "The woman who stole the Eiffel tower". The decadence of Holden's character (that mirrors what Holden himself was going through at this time) can be accounted with a symbolic weight. The 60' were a decade of European bright cinema, that Hollywood would follow, leaded by the so called Vietnam generation.The popcorn selling kiss, that is the more lasting scene of this film in how it fulfills its own assumed cliché is a twilight to a certain type of film. Oh, and we had Audrey...My opinion: 3/5 a bad film that you really have to see.http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Audrey Hepburn plays a typist come to do the dictation of a famous movie writer (!) to help him finish his script.Unfortunately, the writer (William Holden) took the producer's money weeks ago and hasn't done a scrap of work. When the typist arrives, full of hero worship, she discovers he has two days to finish and deliver a completed script -- and all he has is the title: "The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower." Though "Paris" is all about how the two write the screenplay, this is not a movie about the throes of creation (any more than another comedy about a writer, "Throw momma from the Train.") The problem with movies about writers is that a writer's life consists of sitting around staring at the blank pages in the typewriter (then) or a blank computer screen (now). Usually some outside element has to be introduced to make a movie about a writer interesting. "Paris" makes the process of writing the screenplay a surrogate for wooing, as the increasingly desperate (and amorous) Holden dictates to Hepburn (who, as an aspiring writer, offers a few suggestions of her own). What makes this movie more a fantasy than a romantic comedy is that the movie they are writing -- "The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower" -- plays out on-screen, with Holden and Hepburn taking the leads.It must have looked really good on paper. And some of it plays well (as when Holden, after dictating the plot of his movie changes his mind and starts again from an earlier scene, making the movie-within-a-movie rewind). It's all good fun, the way these two people who are falling in love and refuse to admit it, preferring to play out their fantasies in the film they are writing. Holden and Hepburn are perfectly charming doing it.Unfortunately, the movie they're writing is too silly for words. If this is the stuff Holden cranks out for a living, it's a wonder he's rich and famous (are any movie writers rich and/or famous?) There is some good stuff here. An unbilled Tony Curtis (a major star at the time) is a delight as he makes repeated and unflattering appearances in "The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower." Curtis had made comedies ("Some Like it Hot") but was coming off several serious movies ("Taras Bulba," 'The Outsider," "The Great Impostor") when he was slipped into "Paris when it Sizzles." This movie seems to mark Curtis' slide into increasingly inconsequential 60s comedies.More often, "Paris When it Sizzles" fizzles as it makes the mistake of the sillier 1960s comedies. For instance, at a "wild party" (a must in the more inane comedies of the period) Mel Ferrer, who everyone at the time knew as Audrey Hepburn's husband, as well as a big-screen actor in his own right, makes an unbilled cameo playing Dr. Jekyll. There's no rhyme or reason to his appearance, other than to give a giggle to readers of "Photoplay" at the appearance of Hepburn's hubbie. Yet someone must have thought Ferrer's mere appearance would have had the audience rolling in the aisles."Paris" possibly helped inspire that sort of 1960s wackiness where film-makers thought simply being silly for the sake of silliness, apropos of nothing, with a twist of pseudo-psychedelicness, would prove funny. "What's New Pussycat", "Casino Royale" and other nonsense ensued.Hepburn didn't like the finished flick, and Holden may well have had this movie in mind when he wondered if acting was any way for a grown man to make a living; but "Paris" slips under the wire as a success on the star power of Holden, Hepburn and Curtis (and a billed appearance by Noel Coward, who was a grand old man of entertainment at that time, though he's too old here to show why). Even with all that star power the movie sometimes seems to be running on fumes, especially when it gets just a smidge too silly. But it never tries to be anything other than what it is. It has no pretensions. It simply is; and if you like silliness, and big movie stars acting like children, and don't want to watch a movie that makes you think much, you might enjoy this stuff.One word about the romance angle. Much is made about the age difference between Holden and Hepburn. It's only eleven years. Hepburn was thirty-five or so at the time, while Holden was yet on the sunny side of fifty. But Holden is beginning to show wear (especially when he dons his glasses) while Hepburn (possibly due to ingenious makeup) looks fresh as a daisy. Obviously Hepburn isn't playing a thirty-five-year-old. But they're both adults and they seem to be enjoying themselves.The biggest puzzle is the title. It seems like a better title would be "The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower." But I suppose that might mislead some people into thinking it was a tense, Hitchcockian mystery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of Audrey Hepburn and this movie relys heavily - too heavily on her charm. And unfortunately, it is some of her worst acting work, posey, sing-song, and superficial. Now, if you've read her bio, and know what was going on with her and Holden, that could explain it, but still, this film is very static.Like most Heburn films, a highlight is her clothes, her style, her self. This film self-consciously relys on this when the script itself could simply have been better. There are some very fun cameos by big performers that raise moments here. This film would have benefited greatly by a better comic actress in the lead. Jayne Mansfield could have been a hoot in this, Thelma Ritter too, in a very different way, somebody with less style and more off beat snap, crackle, and pop. (Thelma Ritter and William Holden paired in a romantic comedy... I'm all ready laughing!)Before you think I've hit this too harshly, this film was intended to be a trifle, the kind of movie that has bright colors and light plot for a hot summer day that sizzles. For that, it is adequate.The remake, ALEX AND EMMA suffers very much from the same problems. They actually improved the script, and gave the leading lady room to make some very wacky choices, but both films seem to have suffered from "settling for a star" when a less mainstream, more zany actress was needed. OK, this doesn't stink...it has Audrey, but it certainly doesn't sizzle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lesser known Audrey Hepburn film, and let's keep it that way, shall we? It's not Audrey's fault, or Holden's for that matter. The script is just awful. Holden plays a writer struggling to produce a due script with the help of typist Hepburn. The script-in-the-script is worse than anything I've seen before, but that's supposed to be intentional, so should be OK. The wrapping (Holden and Hepburn writing) however is so flimsy that the film itself doesn't fare much better. It's just a long flirt between Holden and Hepburn, so much so that I began thinking that Holden wrote and produced it himself. The title is OK though, I just wish they made a film worthy of it.Edit: just gave it a second try, but my previous opinion still holds. And if it wasn't for Tony -"I have the car right here, sir!"- Curtis, I would lower my vote to a 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not a bad idea for a movie - a self-referential look at the construction and techniques used in the writing of a film - but couching it in a frothy, light romantic comedy robs it of much of it's insight. Where a grizzled William Holden - only 45, but heavy boozing had already put a decade on his features - turns his script around within 48 hours on-screen, the real film's script seems to fall apart like a precocious child that has simply lost interest. A painfully thin Hepburn is winsome, but both she and Holden struggle to make anything worthwhile out of the material they're given to work with. There are a few sharp insights and a number of in-jokes and cameos (including an extended one from Tony Curtis, who manages to perk things up whenever he's on-screen). A failure to be sure - but quite an interesting one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Other than that, Paris WHEN IT SIZZLES is a treat from start to finish and I still can't wonder how it was, or what was about it, that critics hated back when it was released in 1964. It certainly delivers more in the way of comedy and romance, Audrey Hepburn and William Holden play parts that were within their styles and are paired rather well, and the whole movie is an escapist delight. Sure, it pokes fun at the French New Wave of the time -- where nothing happens -- but then, looking at this movie, this is exactly what it is. Maybe this is what critics couldn't stand: that an American movie was trying to fill in the shoes of Goddard or Varda or Demy. Perhaps, had it been lit a specific way, or showcased to really bring out the ethereal in Hepburn (not that this was hard, she was ethereal to begin with) and transcend the little piece into a barrage of visual splendor that, as in the style of Demy, could spring into music at any time. However, this is a simpler movie but even then it's a darned good one. It's just that it's become forgotten over time as something a little embarrassing. I still can't see what the fuss is when all I see is a lightweight comedy. Can that be bad?</fullReview>

Hepburn and William Holden were quite good in their roles though, and I did appreciate a bit of the humor throughout, but overall I felt that the film was more boring than it was funny.

		<fullReview>What might have looked good on paper (before filming started), is not necessarily a guarantee that the project, when executed, will jell. Paramount took a French farce, cast it with bankable stars (AUDREY HEPBURN, WILLIAM HOLDEN), handed the direction to Richard Quine--and then shelved the finished film for two years before releasing it. They should have left it alone gathering dust.It doesn't give any luster to the careers of Hepburn or Holden who were both at the stage in their careers where they didn't need a bad film. Faithful fans went to see this drek when it opened, but millions stayed away and the critics roasted it.The slight premise has a screenwriter (Holden) given a three day deadline to come up with a screenplay, so he hires a daffy secretary (Hepburn) who tries to inspire him by acting out some of the mad fantasies they share about pop culture and the movies. With some style and wit, this could have worked--but, alas, it's clear from the outcome that possibilities were missed and both stars are wasting their time trying to get this comedy to soar into the feathery stratosphere of what passed for light entertainment.No style or substance, just a bad script that gets little assistance from either star. And just what NOEL COWARD is doing in this meager mess is anybody's guess. TONY CURTIS has a couple of bright moments and there's even a peek at MARLENE DIETRICH, but you have to stay awake to catch her.Every major star has had at least one film that falls into the "shouldn't have done it" category--this is one that Hepburn and Holden should definitely have bypassed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paris When It Fizzles Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the fifties and sixties there was a general view in Hollywood that Paris was the city of love, romance, culture and Audrey Hepburn. By 1964 the Divine Audrey had already made four films wholly or partly set in the French capital ("Sabrina", "Love in the Afternoon", "Funny Face" and "Charade") and was to make one more in 1966, "How to Steal a Million". If by chance she was unavailable to make a Parisian comedy, Hollywood generally turned to the nearest thing it had to a Hepburn lookalike, Leslie Caron, to stand in for her. ("An American in Paris", "Lili"). When, therefore, someone had the idea of making a film called "Paris When It Sizzles", Audrey was the obvious choice for the female lead.Like most of Audrey's Parisian films this one is, officially, a romantic comedy, although in many ways it defies categorisation. The two main characters are Richard Benson, a screenwriter, and Gabrielle Simpson, his secretary, who is helping him to type the script to for his latest screenplay, "The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower". As Richard discusses various scenarios with Gabrielle, the two start to act them out in what develops into a film-within-a-film. Richard is never clear exactly what sort of film "The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower" is supposed to be; it is part rom-com, part spy thriller, part crime drama, and occasionally seems to be turning into a vampire horror story or a war film. Its main feature, however, is that it revolves around the romance between its two main characters, Rick and Gaby, which parallels the romance which is growing up between Richard and Gabrielle.Neither Audrey nor the male lead, William Holden, was particularly enthusiastic about doing this film, with good reason. Some ten years earlier they had made another film together, "Sabrina", and had by all accounts become very friendly on set. Whether that friendship was a sexual one or not depends upon which biography you read, but it appears to have ended less than happily. Following this experience they were not keen to work together again, but the studio insisted on their making the film. The unhappy ending to their earlier romance did not prevent Holden from trying to rekindle it on the set of "Paris When It Sizzles", only to find himself rebuffed by Hepburn, by now married to Mel Ferrer. Another problem was that Holden, an alcoholic, was drinking heavily while making the film.Given the troubled history of the two stars, there is more personal chemistry between them than one might expect. Audrey- as vivacious, glamorous and sexy as ever- is particularly charming. Holden and Hepburn dominate the film- no other actor has more than a cameo part. Tony Curtis appears as a policeman, and Noël Coward as a film producer with the oddly Germanic name of Alexander Meyerheim given that Coward plays him, as he played every part, as an upper-class Englishman. In one scene Coward, who was gay in real life, comes close to outing himself when he calls Holden "beautiful" and kisses him.A feature of the film is that it makes reference to previous Hepburn films. When Richard says that he sees Gaby as a "prostitute with a heart of gold", that is an allusion to Hepburn's character Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany's, and a scene in which a gun turns out to be a cigarette lighter may be a reference to the opening scene of "Charade" in which a gun turns out to be a water pistol. (Some of the locations for "Charade", notably the Punch-and-Judy theatre, are reused here). There is also a mention of "My Fair Lady", even though that film had not yet been made. Doubtless, however, it would have been known at the time that a film version of the stage musical was about to be made and that Hepburn was in the running to star in it.Variety magazine called the film "marshmallow-weight hokum", but my main problem went deeper than mere lack of weight. After all, "Charade" is pretty lightweight stuff, and still very enjoyable. My problem with "Paris When It Sizzles" was that I just couldn't see what the point of it was. The real-life romance between Gabrielle and Richard tends to take second place to the "film-within-the-film", which is a bizarre and virtually incomprehensible piece of nonsense. Richard Benson is supposed to be a highly-respected member of his profession, so why is something as flabby and pointless as "The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower" the best effort that he can come up with? If the intention was to satirise incompetent screen writing or various genres of film-making, the material needed to be much more tightly handled than it is.Until recently I was under the impression that Audrey Hepburn was one of the lucky few stars who had not made any seriously bad movies, unless one counts Ferrer's eccentric vanity project "Green Mansions", largely because I had grown up on her acknowledged classics such as "Roman Holiday", "Sabrina", "The Nun's Story", "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and "My Fair Lady". Having tried to familiarise myself with some of the lesser-known entries in her filmography, I realise that my impression was a mistaken one; I did not enjoy either "Robin and Marion" or "Two for the Road", and this film must join those two in the catalogue of films which do not really show her at her best.The title "Paris When It Sizzles" is taken from an old Cole Porter song and has no real connection with the story, beyond the fact that it is set in Paris. In this context, in fact, the title is sadly inappropriate, as the film does not sizzle at all. A better title might have been "Paris When It Fizzles Out". 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only watched Paris when it sizzles because it came with an Audrey Hepburn box set i bought, with 5 Paramount movies she made. I had heard it wasn't very successful but was very curious. The general storyline of a movie within a movie might confuse some people but I found it to be pretty original. In the 'movie' they were playing out, I found some parts to be a bit boring, but enjoyed watching the 'real' relationship between Audrey and William's characters.If Audrey hadn't been in it, I wouldn't have bothered watching it, because I think she is what drives the film. Without Audrey i definitely would have labeled it Paris When It Fizzles. Not her best film but not one worth forgetting either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a "zany" comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They seemed to have a little too much fun filming this...or at least when it was being written. It was filmed in 1962 but not released until two years later. Was it due to president Kennedy being killed in late '63 or because it was a terrible film? The people behind it seemed a little too smug.I must say, Audrey Hepburn, although not suited for crazy comedy gives it her best shot and comes out shining. She gives every hopeless line sparkle. I wonder if she knew it was a bad script? She looks like it sometimes. Apart from William Holden's chest she is the ONLY reason to watch this mess. This was Hollywoods idea of the kind of film adults would want to watch : stars making fools of themselves in lovely places. They make fun of new film ideas at the time such as Godard films and method acting. This was actually Hollywood making a fool of itself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of Julien Duvivier's "la f?te ? Henriette",starring Dany Robin(1952),a movie that has become very hard to see (I haven't seen it myself,although I love Julien Duvivier). Although adapted from Henri Jeanson,one of the best scenarists France had ever known,the thin plot(a scenarist has to write a story in two days with a little help from his assistant)cannot sustain attention during 105 min.The two leads are the main asset of this work.The movie sometimes lacks tempo and the jokes are not that much funny;perhaps Billy Wilder -who had worked with both stars-would have succeeded .But if you like Audrey Hepburn and Paris ,you'll be better off with Stanley Donen's "funny face"(1956).Or if you are as lucky as the Australian user,try to see the original which has got a very good reputation in France.I had finally the oppotunity to see Duvivier's movie last night (April 2006).I would avoid any comparison .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Holden really reached stardom in 1950 with "Sunset Blvd.", and subsequently gained an Oscar for "Stalag 17". A man with one of the most effective screen voices, he also was handsome in a realistic way. But it took Holden a dozen or so years of struggle in Hollywood before Billy Wilder put him into "Sunset Blvd."Imagine his fascination when (in 1954) Wilder cast him in "Sabrina" opposite another new star of the first rank, Ms Audrey Hepburn. Hepburn had only been in a handful of movies in the very late 1940s and early 1950s before William Wyler got her charm and intelligence to the world audience's in "Roman Holiday" (and also won her an Oscar). It is true that one of her pre-"Roman Holiday" films was "The Lavandar Hill Mob" (she had a walk-on scene as Alec Guiness's girlfriend), but "Roman Holiday" was like her fourth movie! Yet she was now Holden's co-star.Most people like "Sabrina" (this writer does), but it has it's critics - mostly aiming at Humphrey Bogart as the third co-star. I think it is an unfair point to belabor the age difference between Linus(Bogart) and David Larrabee (Holden), as the screenplay does suggest that Linus is the older, more reclusive brother from the start. More important though was Billy Wilder's serious cast management problems. Hepburn and Holden got along with him very well, and he would work with both again. But Bogart was another matter. Bogie did not get along with either Wilder or Holden, and had little tolerance (why?) for Hepburn. So it was a chore to get the film into the can.It's nice to note that before Bogie died Wilder and he made up their differences. But just as "Roman Holiday" opened up a lifetime friendship between Hepburn and co-star Gregory Peck; just as "Golden Boy" opened up a lifetime of gratitude and friendship between newcomer Holden and star Barbara Stanwick; "Sabrina" opened up a friendship between Hepburn and Holden (after all they had Bogie sniping at both of them).So for years the two surviving co-stars of "Sabrina" hoped to work with each other in another, friendlier film. In 1962 Holden's contract with Paramount finally ended, and his last film for the studio was "Paris - When It Sizzles". And finally he and Audrey were able to do a film together again.Unfortunately there was one serious difference - "Sabrina" was based on a successful play called "Sabrina Fair", and (whatever problems among the crew) it stands up fairly well. "Paris - When It Sizzles" (how much one would like Bogie to be around now to say something ironically nasty about that title!) has one of the worst film scripts imaginable for a film that has cast that includes Holden, Hepburn, Tony Curtis (in bits and pieces), Marlene Dietrich, Noel Coward, and even Mel Ferrer. Hell, even Frank Sinatra ends up on the sound-track.It's supposed to be a charming spoof on screenplay hackdom. Actually there is a pretty good film about that written in the 1930s (based on a successful play) called "Boy Meets Girl", and starring Pat O'Brien, Jimmy Cagney, and Ralph Bellamy. To imagine that this one is superior is an insult to the fun and craftsmanship that the authors of that farce (the Spivaks) and Pat, Jimmy, and Ralph brought to audiences from 1938 on. Here Holden is now more rumpled and with more of the alcoholic problem that would dodge him until his accidental death in 1981. He has been given an advance to start work on a screenplay set in Paris called "The Girl Who Stole The Eiffel Tower"*. Holden has spent part, but has not begun the work - but a typist (Hepburn) shows up to help him with the screenplay. *There is a film with Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone based on a novel by Georges Simonon about Inspector Maigret called "The Man On The Eiffel Tower" (1949), and there was also an actual fraud perpetrated twice (believe it or not) of a so-called "Count" who sold the "doomed" tower to scrap metal dealers! What we see is Holden's self-contempt, for he has degraded his once good abilities by becoming a cliché master. The creativity he needs is apparently dead. As one idea after another is tried out by Holden and Hepburn (they shoot or re-shoot the imagined script and again and again, changing scenes and motivations, and even making the film a family entertainment when it can be sexy) we watch an unwatchable mess take shape.Holden's idea finally becomes what if the costliest movie shot in years is stolen by an international thief and held for ransom? How would the studio owner (Coward) and the police (Gregoire Aslan and Tony Curtis) react? And what is the role of the mysterious girl (Hepburn) in this?The results is not good - it's a shambles about making a script on one upside down cliché after another. Unless a spoof like that is written seriously and carefully it is never done well.Supposedly Holden was drying out just before the film, and as it was the last on his contract his studio did not care how he would be seen in the work. But it was a really lousy film - and Paramount held back release for a couple of years.Unfortunately, after the promise of "Sabrina", "Paris - When It Sizzles" was the last time Holden and Hepburn worked together. For the pleasure of seeing that, and Curtis (belatedly) brought in as a supporting actor (second detective of the Surete under Aslan), it's worth a "5" out of "10". Coward is dressed up like a Roman Emperor at a costume party. That is also of interest - but he has little to do except to act like Noel Coward above it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Divinely Mediocre Movie with Glorious Paris on View</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Except the writer has a lot of very cogent informed comments to make on the triviality of the making of a movie. And how trashy most of the dialogue is. As Bushy haired ...chestwise.....Bill Holden who I have adored for so long, issues long soliques to saucer eyed Aubrey Hepburn (no kin to Katherine), you have to applaud the quite realistic take on what is looked at today as 'movie-making'. No wonder the writers are treated so shabbily. I prefer myself to have a writer who produces wonderfully intelligent dialogue, not the garbage we hear in most movies. Even though this one was silly, I just got back from Paris and my hotel is shown in the opening, as Audrey drives by Notre Dame Cathedral. The Hotel Notre Dame is the red-canopied hotel on the corner she then drives by, and it has a fantastic tub where you can rest your head and lie in the bubbles, then rise and look out at the all the flying buttresses that support that most amazing edifice.Unless you love Paris, William Holden, Audrey Hepburn, or some caustic remarks on film making, skip this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even if you haven't seen the (until recently) elusive La Fete Henriette from which George Axelrod ripped off his screenplay this is still pretty dire. There's nothing wrong with the basic premise - it did, after all, produce a masterpiece as written by Henri Jeanson and directed by Julien Duvivier - and nothing wrong with either Audrey Hepburn or William Holden, the problem starts when you get Hepburn and Holden to agree to star in an inept Hollywood remake of a French classic. Think about it: Hepburn plus Holden plus Paris how can it go wrong. Let me count the ways. On second thoughts don't, we'd be here all day. Suffice it to say Audrey looks as gorgeous as she ever did, Holden is as charming as he ever was but somewhere along the way ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why I hate this film !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am an Audrey Hepburn fan and generally love her movies but this one I absolutely hate. It is the sort of movie that if I saw it at the cinema, I would come out before the end and I can say with honesty I have only ever done that once.There are many films I don't get first time round but the penny usually drops on reviewing and I like it that way, but this one leaves me cold. If it was funny I could forgive the screenwriters but I can sure watch this one with a straight face.Sorry. Why did I buy it ? It was part of a set.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious dialogue and William Hammy Holden make this irksome. Don't waste your time and money.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be quite honest. I gave this one ten minutes, which is more than I suggest you give it.Its got some really pretentious dialogue, and the two lead actors are not good in this - perhaps due to a lack of direction. Wiliam Holden was always bad, but here his patronising "this is a movie" voice really makes it impossible to swallow.We partly have George Axelrod for that. His play, and work on the screenplay for Seven Year Itch was delightful - but a very big style that apparently can really bomb when put into the hands of someone like William Holden.I wish i could get my two dollars back.0/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything is awful in this dreck: the leads, the pacing, the lack of direction, the lack of a solid script ... etc. Four minutes into this BOMB Holden plants a kiss on Hepburn and then Curtis follows in an embarrassing cameo. Wait if you blinked you missed Dietrich's cameo ... oh who cares?! I stopped viewing this awful film after twelve minutes and saved myself a loss of two plus hours watching this drivel. Terrible, just plain awful terrible crap that should be removed from circulation, all copies burned plus the master negative, and the film removed from any future mention in the actor's list of screen roles. Get the point? Take your kid out to the park, offer to do volunteer work, but never ever sit through this pile of junk.</fullReview>
