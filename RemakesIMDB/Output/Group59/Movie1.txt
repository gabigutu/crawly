		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This late jazz age comic morality tale directed by D. W. Griffith is surprisingly good--and its relative sophistication will be a surprise to those who are familiar with Griffith via the standard films such as "The Birth of a Nation," "Intolerance," "Way Down East," or even "Broken Blossoms." This film feels much more modern and far less overtly moralizing than those earlier films, though its 1920s "feel" is a part of its appeal for contemporary viewers.The new DVD is well scored with period music cues that evoke a consistent, slightly melancholy mood as Jean Hersholt (better known as the villain of "Greed") is thrown into his midlife crisis by gold digger Phyllis Haver. His family is convincingly shown in turmoil--and eventually acts to rescue Hersholt's character from his folly. The film is well structured and altogether charming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is A D.W. Griffith Film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Conventional wisdom says that D.W. Griffith didn't make a good movie after he lost his Mamaroneck studio in 1924. Between SALLY OF THE SAWDUST with W.C. Fields (1925) and THE STRUGGLE (1931), Griffith made 6 feature films for United Artists and Paramount. Most of these have been dismissed out of hand since they first appeared and a few are no longer available. THE BATTLE OF THE SEXES (1928) garnered him some of the worst notices of his career (to be outdone by his last film THE STRUGGLE) although preview audiences loved it. I have seen a restored version of the film and am hard pressed to understand all the negative reviews. The settings by William Cameron Menzies are lavish, the photography by Karl Struss is top notch, and the editing, normally Griffith's Achilles heel, is smooth and polished. It clearly shows that Griffith could take advantage of the Hollywood studio system when given the chance. So why all the bad press? Part of the problem lies in the way the film was promoted. BATTLE OF THE SEXES was billed as a Jazz Age comedy when it was actually a domestic drama with several comic moments. Although the story is melodramatic and features the required happy ending, the emotions of the characters ring true. This was Griffith's greatest strength as a filmmaker. No matter how trite or objectionable the plot you believe his characters even when you don't agree with them. Best known for his epics, Griffith was essentially a miniaturist as his Biograph shorts clearly demonstrate. His feature films are more successful when done on a smaller scale and while dealing with people and their relationships (BROKEN BLOSSOMS, ISN'T LIFE WONDERFUL). Jean Hersholt gives one of his finest performances as a philandering husband. His encounter with a reducing machine in order to make himself look younger is both comic and pathetic. Phyllis Haver is the ultimate Jazz Baby and she lights up the screen with a performance that is both funny AND sexy. The robe she wears to seduce Hersholt must be seen through to be believed. Belle Bennett (THE IRON MASK) as the spurned wife also deserves special mention. THE BATTLE OF THE SEXES proves that Griffith had not lost his touch after he lost his independence. Thanks to Image Entertainment for upgrading this title to DVD as part of their D.W. Griffith collection. Now if they could just rescue ISN'T LIFE WONDERFUL and THE STRUGGLE from VHS oblivion as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This late (1928) silent from D.W. Griffith includes much of what we expect from the man: a highly moral tale, the action centered around a nuclear family, little humor but used effectively, careful plotting, and direction that elicits excellent acting with fine nuances of mood. It is actually considerably less preachy than Griffith's epic works (Intolerance, etc.), and despite the grandiose title, the story is simple: A golddigger and her beau set their sights on a rich man, happily married with two teenage children. The blonde vamp gets her prey, successfully enticing him from his family and driving his wife into a suicidal depression, but his canny daughter manages to rescue the situation. As with most fine movies, the story, though simple, is very well told. Some splendid insights into 1920s American mores and popular culture round out the package. Newly (2001) released on VHS by Kino.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one won't change your life, but it's a very pleasant little morality tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very surprised when I watched this film that it was by director D. W. Griffith, as in places the direction looked very modern--much more than I had seen in many of his previous films. In particular, at the beginning, there are some very creative sweeping shots and camera tricks. They are also quite apparent towards the end of the film. Plus, even though this is at heart a morality tale, it seemed so much less histrionic and preachy than other Griffith films I've seen. For 1928, the film was well-done and quite watchable.Jean Hersholt is a rich industrialist and Phyllis Haver decides when she first sees him that she MUST have him--not out of any love at all, but because she is a "gold digger". Despite his being a rather ordinary looking older man and being happily married, Ms. Haver throws her energies into snagging the guy. This actually leads to a cute scene where she is trying to think up how she will introduce herself to him--it doesn't go at all like she planned, but it does indeed work! And, disappointingly, Hersholt is at heart a dope and he falls for her routine without question. In the meantime, his family doesn't suspect until they accidentally catch him with the bimbo when he is supposed to be working late! Where exactly the movie goes next and all the little details I'll leave for you to discover. However, the movie is a breezy and interesting little film worth seeing if you like silent cinema. The Kino Video version features excellent music and an excellent quality print.PS--Although she's not listed in the credits and the IMDb database does NOT confirm it, it looks as if Joan Blondell is one of the extras in the nightclub scene. If it's not her, it's a dead-ringer!PPS--According to IMDb, Phyllis Haver retired from movies a short time after making this film, as she married a millionaire and stopped working! Now THAT'S irony!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Redrawing the Battle Lines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gold-digging Phyllis Haver (as Marie Skinner) seduces New York real estate tycoon Jean Hersholt (as William Judson), breaking up his happy marriage. After Mr. Hersholt's wife falls into a deep depression, cute and perky daughter Sally O'Neil (as Ruth) takes a gun to shoot Ms. Haver, whom the family has seen out dancing with Hersholt. Then, Ms. O'Neil finds herself prey to handsome jazz hound Don Alvarado (as Babe Winsor), who also serves as Haver's lover.This curious film was director D.W. Griffith's re-make of his much imitated 1914 hit (presently, a "lost" film). "The Battle of the Sexes" is curious because it's rather well done, and from a period when Mr. Griffith is recalled to have been in sad decline. The film received some good notices, was a box office success, and featured some innovative work from Griffith plus cameramen Karl Struss and Billy Bitzer. Watch for a "fight" scene with Haver hurling objects at Hersholt, then dejected wife Belle Bennett's perilous walk on the couple's rooftop.Restored in 2000, the film boasts a lively new score, compiled by Rodney Sauer and Susan Hall. The small orchestral soundtrack is excellent, and can be enjoyed on its own; but, it doesn't really match the original. "The Battle of the Sexes" has the look of a film shown with synchronized sound effects (a silent/sound hybrid, favoring the former). The original music and effects are missed. It looks like a couple of scenes went with it - there had to have been an additional encounter between O'Neil and Mr. Alvarado, and a reason why he and Hersholt arrive at Haver's with the same new hat.If only the waiter who returned with Hersholt's "Reserved" sign could as easily bring back missing film footage...******** The Battle of the Sexes (10/12/28) D.W. Griffith ~ Jean Hersholt, Phyllis Haver, Sally O'Neil, Don Alvarado</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Battle of the Sexes is a departure from D.W. Griffith's usual fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After years of doing period dramas like Broken Blossoms, Way Down East, and Orphans of the Storm, D.W. Griffith takes us to present day 20s with The Battle of the Sexes. A young blond curly-haired woman (Phyllis Haver) flirts with a married real estate developer (Jean Hersholt) in order to get some bonds from him. The developer had just celebrated his wife's (Belle Bennett) birthday with his teenage son (William Bakewell) and daughter (Sally O'Neil). He tells his family he's working late. The children and mother decide to go to a nightclub. They catch their father with the blond woman inside said nightclub but leave before father catches them. Wife confronts husband about affair. They separate. Daughter later overhears blond woman talking to friend about how she only cares about father's money. I'll stop right here and just tell you how Griffith affectedly puts humor in some scenes like the father's attempts to lose weight, or the blond woman's attempt to attract father by positioning her shirt to show more cleavage. There's also a touching mother's birthday scene at the beginning, and near the end great scenes involving confrontations between father and daughter and blond woman and her real paramour (Don Alvarado). If you only know Griffith as the director of the racist The Birth of a Nation, this is as far from that movie as you get from him. For D.W. Griffith completists and silent movie fans, I highly recommend you seek this one out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>D. W. Griffith goes Jazz-Age as golddigger Phyllis Haver tries to steal Jean Hersholt from hearth &amp; home.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Penultimate silent from D.W. Griffith was dismissed upon release, but now looks perfectly respectable if unexceptional. Wealthy middle-aged Jean Hersholt is netted by gold-digging Phyllis Haver, but his plucky daughter, Sally O'Neill, exposes an on-going relationship w/ lounge lizard Don Alvardo &amp; returns wayward Papa to hearth &amp; home. The film opens smartly with a well crafted barbershop situational, but the sex farce aspects don't bring out an inner Monte Bell or Ernst Lubitsch in DW. As the story darkens in the last act, he comes alive, especially for the suicide attempt by Belle Bennett as the deserted, loyal wife. Wonderfully shot (mostly by Karl Struss) &amp; in superb condition, but Griffith is just treading water.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre Griffith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Battle of the Sexes' might be one those lesser seen (and known) films by D.W. Griffith, and it falls far from his greatest Works, but still it's worth to watch. Though it is typical Griffith's morality tale it somehow seems to avoid becoming too preachy like the great master loved to do. The story is simple tale about gold digger who seduces real estate tycoon, and the man abandons his family for younger woman.Otherwise quite mediocre film, but there was some nice sweeping shots at the beginning of the film, and of course the marvelously directed rooftop scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Battle of the Sexes, The (1928) ** 1/2 (out of 4) D.W. Griffith film about an older, rich man (Jean Hersholt) who leaves his wife and two kids when he meets a young, beautiful blonde (Phyllis Haver). The man thinks this younger woman loves him but she's actually just a gold digger. Having been accused of not being able to connect with modern crowds, Griffith made this light weight film but the change of direction really didn't help his career any. Movie crowds, while small, enjoyed the film but the critics gave this the worst reviews of his career up to this point. I think time has been fairly kind to the film, which has some wonderful stuff but sadly the story is just way too predictable, even by 1928 standards. The direction is tight throughout and the performances are all very good. Hersholt is terrific as the dumb old man, Haver plays the gold digger perfectly but it's Sally O'Neil who steals the show of the man's daughter. The highlight of the film is a wonderful scene taking place on a dance floor. The film has a strange mix of comedy and drama that really don't mix well but it's nice seeing Griffith doing a film in modern settings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie cracks me up!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing this movie in 2007 makes it twice as funny! I'd like to see the reaction of the wife in the 21st century! I know what my reaction would be. The middle-aged, overweight husband is really funny in thinking somebody would fall for him! I'm not sure what kind of recourse she would have had back then, but I would have told him that he'd better come to his senses or I would drag him through divorce court by his (thinning) hair and skinned him for everything he had and some. The wife is also about twice as big as the floozy, so I would probably have pounded her into the ground. But, that wouldn't been nearly as funny as the melodramatic way the family behaves. It's a good morality tale, however.</fullReview>
