		<shortDescription>Depression-Era Fairy Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie must have played very well to depression-era audiences. The story of an apple seller who has been lying to her daughter who has done well for herself in Europe is sweet, heart touching and funny.Great, quotable lines in the script, well written. The outdoors night photography is luminous, everything seems to glow, a scene in an outdoor garden with the daughter and her fiancee kissing behind a glass water fountain is beautiful to this day.The ideas of friends and strangers coming to a needy person's aid prefigures such later Capra classics as "It's A Wonderful Life". In fact, they would make an excellent double feature together. In our cynical times, movies like this can be seen as hokey, in fact the name Capra was frequently turned into Capra-corn, even in his day. But the fact that his movies are still treasured and enjoyed today shows that goodness is still an enduring quality and that being drawn to goodness and fairy tales like this gives us hope that those feelings are still in us.Recommended highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Almost 70 years on, this film is as fresh as ever, with brilliant performances, great dialogue, and an irresistible story, even if you don't believe in fairy tales. Watch out for the butler's line, addressing Happy MacGuire, who talks in the not-so-grammatically-correct mob-lingo of the 1930s: "If I had a choice of weapon with you, Sir, I'd choose grammar." Definitely a must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Capra's very best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sublime, charming fairy tale, about an old apple seller (the lovely May Robson) who is helped by a gangster named Dave the Dude (Warren William) and his buddies in order to make her rich and respectable for her returning daughter and in-law from Spain, is conceivably Capra's freshest, most underrated classic, perhaps with the exception of "The Bitter Tea of General Yen", which was also released in 1933. While "Bitter Tea" was a commercial flop, "Lady For a Day" proved to be Capra's first big success with the Depression-era audiences and a sign of things to come. A must-see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I may have to change my mind about Capra!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm no Capra fan, but here's a second movie of his (along with "The Miracle Woman") that I just loved. Maybe his pre-Codes are better than his other movies? I may have to change my mind about Capra, or at least see some more of his pre-Code movies; they're terrific! This movie was sweet and touching, without being sickening sweet or melodramatic. This movie also has lots of humor and some great dialogue. This 72-yr-old movie holds up extremely well. I was utterly charmed by this movie.The story revolves around an elderly woman, Apple Annie, who is quite poor. She sells apples for a living and sends all her money to her daughter, Louise, who lives in Spain. Annie is ashamed of her lifestyle, and she leads her daughter to believe she's a high-society lady by writing letters on the stationery of a posh hotel. Annie even has a friend on the inside of the hotel who passes Louise's letters that are sent to the hotel to Annie.One of Apple Annie's clients is "Dave the Dude", the head of a local mob. Before he does any business dealings, Dave always buys an apple from Annie for good luck.Well, not to spoil the movie too much, let me just say that Annie finds out her daughter is coming to town (New York) and she panics. Her panhandler friends talk Dave into setting Annie up in a suite at the posh hotel so that she can continue the pretense for her daughter's sake. Dave gets most of his mobster and street friends involved in one way or another -- the potential is here for great sappiness, but amazingly the story unfolds with just pure sweetness and lots of humor that has held up very well over the past 3/4-century.The performances by the lead actors were terrific. May Robson as Annie was wonderful; she gave a tender, subtle performance as the mother who loved her daughter so much, yet was so ashamed of the way she (Annie) lived. Warren William was terrific as Dave the Dude - I think his was probably the toughest role to play as he had to be a "bad guy" mob head as well as a softie who went out of his way to make Annie a lady for a day. Guy Kibbee as Annie's husband was superb, a common pool hustler who played an upper-crust gentleman. The rest of the cast were pretty good too ... I especially enjoyed the actor who played the dry and sardonic "Happy"; he had some of the best lines in the show.So, in conclusion, snappy dialogue, nice mix of drama and humor, and just the right amount of sweetness make for a wonderful pre-Code movie. If you enjoy old movies, this is a movie that you definitely won't be sorry you watched. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original as usual, better than color remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Glenn Ford and Betty Davis in color fall short competing with the BW original version with lesser known but more convincing actors. Lets face facts. Glenn Ford never played a convincing bad guy/bad boy. On the other hand little known Warren William had to convince the viewers that he wasn't a bad guy all the time. Dave the Dude is basically a bad guy with a touch of good. Even his act of kindness to Annie is self serving. This movie is a perfect example that technical advances don't make a better story, lesser known actors can play the role better, and age can define whether any work of art can stand up to the ultimate critic - Time. Different audiences, tastes, standards and means of portraying the play, are the ultimate judge regarding the worth of the production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first step by Capra to celebrity. It's a warm and charming comedy, a kind of fairy tale set in the early 1930's, with all the tips that made gangster movies of that time so precious. There are the nicknames (Happy McGuire, who don't smile), the words (a kisser is a woman's lips) and even the music (Hear Ned Sparks whistle The Prisonner's Song when there are cops around The Dude night club.) All the actors are great, but May Robson gives a great emotional performance. Even if this movie is very representative of the 1930's, it stillssounds very fresh today. Please, don't look at the version that Capra will made in the early 1960's, with Bette Davis. This is the real thing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Made Columbia Pictures With A Second Choice Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the days of the studio system only one B picture outfit managed to vault itself into the big time and compete with the majors. That studio was Harry Cohn's Columbia and the film that did it was Frank Capra's Lady For A Day.In his very candid memoirs Capra said unabashedly that his goal was to win one of those statues nicknamed Oscar. The Motion Picture Academy Awards were only five years old, but still the awards were coveted then because it meant prestige and far bigger salaries and in a director's case, bigger budgets to work with. Capra said he tried and failed with a very arty film, The Bitter Tea of General Yen which lost money for Columbia and Cohn. He set out try it a different way with a sentimental story from that most sentimental of writers, Damon Runyon. The original story was entitled Madame LaGimp and it was about a street beggar who the great city of New York takes to its heart for a brief period with the assistance of a gangster with a streak of sentiment.But this was Columbia, the poverty row studio so Capra couldn't get the only old lady movie star around in Marie Dressler from MGM. May Robson was his second choice for Apple Annie, the street beggar who has a daughter in a convent school in Spain and engaged to marry into Spanish nobility. As for the gangster Capra wanted James Cagney, but Harry Cohn couldn't pry him loose from Jack Warner. He was offered Warren William instead and certainly the dapper and elegant William played a different kind of gangster than Cagney would have. For William's moll, Capra's partner and screenwriter for Lady for a Day Robert Riskin persuaded his then girl friend Glenda Farrell to take the part. She Jack Warner was willing to part with.With the great skill that Capra had in casting his films, some of the best character actors around like Guy Kibbee, Nat Pendleton, Ned Sparks, and Walter Connolly filled out his roster. A lot of these people would work for Frank Capra again and again.Came Oscar time and Lady for a Day had the great distinction of being nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, and Best Screenplay adapted from another source. This was the first film from Columbia Pictures that was ever nominated for anything by the Motion Picture Academy. May Robson made Capra forget he ever wanted Marie Dressler. Unfortunately she lost to a young actress picking up her first of four Oscars, Katharine Hepburn.Riskin lost to the writers of Little Women and the film itself lost that year to the British story Cavalcade. One of the most embarrassing moments in Frank Capra's life occurred when Awards host Will Rogers in announcing the Best Director said "come up and get it Frank."Capra rose thinking it was him and the spotlights came down on him. Then there was a frantic buzzing and the spotlight shifted to the opposite side of the hall where Frank Lloyd got up to accept the award that was meant for him for directing Cavalcade. Talk about feeling like a nickel looking for change.However next year Capra's next film It Happened One Night swept all the major Oscars including his first. It sounds like something that only could have happened in a Frank Capra movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great early Capra</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is the film that precedes IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT for the team of Frank Capra (director) and Robert Riskin (screenwriter). Sadly it's not regarded as one of his beloved classics...it deserves to be. William Warren is the perfect Dave the Dude, who's heart of gold aids the distressed aged damsel (May Robson...the titled LADY FOR A DAY). Most of it's innocent charm and humor haven't faded over the 71 years since it's release. Speaking of 70's...at 74 May Robson was the oldest actress to receive a Best Actress nomination.the scene near the end; where she's received by the real mayor of New York and his party guests at her phony party (meant to show off her "society" friends to her daughter, and future inlaws) is priceless. Miss Robson's quiet, teary eyed smile will still bring the viewer to near tears today. Also, Guy Kibbie, and Ned Sparks provide reliable comic support. a must see for all Capra fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not often (especially these days) that a character actor or actress pulls a leading role. This movie rates my 8/10 vote mostly on the strength of the marvelous character performance of May Robson in the central role as Apple Annie, an elderly down-and-out who must somehow preserve the imaginary persona she has built for herself to her daughter, soon to arrive from Paris with a prospective husband in tow. Robson was nominated for an Oscar, as lead, and richly deserved it for her tragicomic characterization.Frank Capra's excellent direction (also nominated for an Oscar) keeps the plot unfolding with the speed and apparently effortless fluidity so characteristic of the comedies of this period. Capra did not win the Oscar that year, but this film launched his series of feel-good dramas and sparkling comedies that netted him three subsequent Oscars.But this is far more than a feel-good comedy/drama. It's an excellent movie that stands on its merits outside the genre, with a solid supporting cast. Capra's own remake (Pocketful of Miracles), doesn't meet the standard he himself set here. And although I have tremendous respect for Bette Davis, who played the lead in the remake, it is the difference between a good performance and an exceptional portrayal. Now that I've seen this version, May Robson simply IS Apple Annie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Others have said it all! However, check out the beautiful love scene photographed through a glass fountain. Absolutely GORGEOUS! Solid performances from the stars right down to the supporting actors. I think we hardly ever see great supporting actors like these any more. Frank Capra wrote about this movie in his autobiography, apparently one of his first hits, using the recipe of lesser-known actors, a great scriptwriter, and a low budget. He relies heavily on the great supporting actors available to him and gave them all a Runyon-esquire quality which never fails to please. They are all just great! Check this movie out! It gets better every time I see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lady for a Day Themes and Thoughts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Things aren't always what they seem. A person may appear to be rich, happy, and enjoying life, when in fact they are poorer than dirt, have not smiled in days, and are just miserable everyday. Apple Annie was a woman who didn't live in the best of circumstances but she made the best of what she had. She sold apples to earn money to send to her daughter living in Spain. Such a kind old woman who is trying her best to survive, and she makes that best of her poor little life. She has made many friends in her life some poorer than her and other who are well enough off to not even worry about money. An acquaintance that she has, Dave the Dude, is a well off man, although it is not of total honest ways, as he is the leader of a gang, but he is always kind to Apple Annie and believes that she is good luck for him. He believes that an apple a day does more than keep the doctor away, it keeps the cops away as well as gives him luck in his dealings. Not quite the fairy tale that one would expect but maybe it is. Is it possible that bad guys have good qualities? Can a grown man believe in a fairy tale? Can a lie really turn out to be good or must it be covered up by a string of more lies.In Lady for a Day we see much of a fairy tale made of lies come to life through the kindness of a mobster. Annie is embarrassed about her standard of living, and sets up the allusion to her daughter that Annie is a lady of the upper class. She writes letters on the stationery of a classy hotel. She has set up a seemingly harmless lie that she is doing better in life than she really is. This is fine until Louise sends a letter saying she is coming home and bringing a suitor and his father Count Romero. Now Annie finds herself in a bind. She must cover up this lie so that her daughter can keep her lover. Annie fears that if she does not live up to the life style, which her daughter thinks she has, everything will fall apart.Her penniless friends talk Dave the Dude into setting Annie up in a room at the classy hotel so that she can go on her lie. Dave who is a bad guy in the sight of the law has a touch of good in him. He believes that he can help what he sees as a fairy tale to come to pass. A parallel to Cinderella Dave becomes the fairy godmother that helps dear Annie to live her dream. But this is not a simple answer. Now that Annie has her classy suite in the hotel, there is more of the story that she has to fulfill. The story follows a perfect line of events. We see the objective of Annie and the obstacles that she must over come. The action just starts rising from the moment she gets the letter from the hotel manager. She has to find her second husband, and even throw a party for the Count before they leave. The point in the movie where I was on the edge of my seat was when we were waiting for Dave and his gangster friends to arrive at this classy party. Leave it to the police to draw out what seems to be a simple gathering to put a stop to the gangster's sinister plans. What a way to bring the movie to a climax. The resolution finally comes after a little added suspense of Dave being arrested, almost. The party goes on with a few unexpected guests; the police chief and even the governor play in to this fairy tale to help it have a happy ending. And the story ends on what could be a happy note, an end to a string of lies, but then again it could be just the beginning of a happily ever after marriage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" May Robson Is Splendid As Apple Annie "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you enjoy the film Pocketful Of Miracles, which was the remake of this film, I highly recommend watching Lady for a Day the original. I found a copy of a 1933 review for this charming film and it states ' a picture which evoked laughter and tears from an audience at the first showing,' and it still hits the mark perfectly today as it did in 1933. May Robson was a superb choice to play Apple Annie and her performance is extremely splendid, she completely embodies the character of Annie, thus making her real and believable. Probably May Robson's best performance ever. No one could have done a better job of playing the lovable old Judge Blake than the wonderful Guy Kibbee. Warren William adequately handles the role of Dave the Dude along with Glenda Farrell as Missouri Martin. A host of excellent supporting actors all give sufficient performances to make this amusing sentimental tale of the grey-haired Cinderella a very pleasurable and entertaining film. There are many fine synopsis written for this film, however Lady for a Day must be seen to be fully appreciated. This is also a terrific example of Frank Capra's best work and one of the finest films from the 1930s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So far-fetched, yet so wonderful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fantasy of depression life in New York was like "Gold Diggers of 1933" in its sympathy to the variety of character types who roamed the theatre district in search of a future. If Little Orphan Annie at this time was hoping for an escape from Miss Hannigan's reign of terror at the orphanage, the aged Apple Annie was hoping to find a way to bring happiness to her beautiful daughter raised in a Spanish convent and now engaged to a nobleman whose father wants to meet the mother in order to approve the match. The help of jaded gambler Warren William, crusty Ned Sparks, dipsomaniac judge Guy Kibbee and nightclub entertainer Glenda Farrell might just put the scheme of making her look like a lady (shades of "Pygmallion"), showing that at least in Runyeonland, gangsters have good hearts, especially if an apple a day brings luck at the race track.Character actress May Robson brings much heart to the down-on-her-luck Annie who longs to see her daughter at least one last time and be seen as the great lady she could have been rather than the poor street vendor she has become. Warren William escapes from the playboys and ruthless businessmen he was playing over at Warner Brothers to take on one of his most memorable roles as the good-hearted gangster (a staple in Damon Runyeon tales) while Ned Sparks gets most of the funniest lines. He delivers them with a cigar in his mouth, acid spewing and joy exploding out of every wisecrack he makes. Nat Pendleton is also amusing as the lovable dumb lug Shakespeare, Williams' right hand man.The chemistry between Robson and Guy Kibbee (pretending to be her husband) is totally charming, giving the impression that there will be a nice September romance once the story we see on screen ends. Parker is lovely as the innocent daughter, but Barry Norton and Walter Connelly seem miscast as Spanish nobility. That is a minor flaw through a film that totally engrosses you and goes straight to the heart.</fullReview>

Warren William, though not one of my favorite actors, is perfect for the part as the lovable cad who decides to do Annie a good deed and help her pose as a decent society lady to fool her child who has been away at boarding school and has not idea of the type of woman Annie is. Frank Capra's direction, pacing and cinematography are all excellent--this is a nice piece of art. Many years later, by the way, Capra remade this film as POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES, but it in no way equals the original--it's just too brash and forced.

		<shortDescription>Pygmalion Annie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a way, it's a shame May Robson didn't win an Oscar for her performance as Apple Annie in this first cinematic version of Damon Runyon's story. Robson was nominated but lost to Katharine Hepburn for MORNING GLORY. It is, without a doubt, the defining role in the actress's long and illustrious stage and film career. She spends the first half hour as a loud- mouthed street urchin who gives apples and luck to a shady character named Dave the Dude (Warren William). But when she finds out her European-based daughter is coming for a visit, she confesses to Dave and his cronies that she's been playing a charade, pretending in letters to the girl she's a high society woman who lives at a nearby posh hotel.The reason Dave decides to help Annie when the daughter soon visits is somewhat far- fetched, but it sets the stage for a miraculous transformation. Dave's girlfriend (Glenda Farrell) gives Annie an incredible makeover, while Dave lines up a nice suite for Annie and a phony husband (Guy Kibbee) to use when hosting the daughter and the daughter's soon-to- be in-laws. Personally, I felt the transformation of Annie was a bit unrealistic. I think Dave's girlfriend would have been a little more tacky and probably would have overdone the makeup on Annie. Also, I didn't buy the fact that as soon as Annie has clean skin, glamorous clothes and jewelry as well as a spectacular new hairdo that she would all of a sudden talk in softer tones with the sweetest words rolling off her tongue. Probably Annie would still be talking like a sailor and not so easily lose her crude mannerisms. But despite these contrivances, the transformation is memorable and it does enable the story to progress to the next level.In the next part, the daughter (Jean Parker) arrives, and there is an emotional reunion between mother and daughter down at the pier. This continues as they head back to the hotel. The hoax seems to be working, until we find out the prospective groom's father has suspicions about Annie and the others. There is also supposed to be a reception that brings the creme de la creme of upper crust society to Annie's suite, which forces Dave and his gang to scramble to come up with acceptable guests. Of course, we know Dave won't fail in this endeavor, and that Annie will be able to pull her deception off with her daughter's in-laws. If not, the story would not have a happy ending. And by the time the film ends, we've been treated to what is basically a nice mother-daughter story; as well as a sort of Pygmalion for the over-60 apple vending crowd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartwarming comedy drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra would make two films based on Damon Runyon's story, "Madame La Gimp." This first was a hit and earned four Oscar nominations for the then B-row film studio, Columbia. Capra had a great story to build on, and Columbia assembled a very capable cast. The result was this heartwarming comedy. Almost 30 years later, Capra got a chance to reprise the movie, with a new title, some other changes, and a cast of big name actors. While that movie is very good as well, "Lady for a Day" remains the signature performance of Runyon's Broadway story.Other reviewers have noted the fine performances of the cast, especially Mary Robson in the title role of Apple Annie. Warren William does a banner job as Dave the Dude. One thing that stands out in this film over the later version is the costuming and sets. For instance, the lineup of chorus girls in Missouri Martin's club, and the club décor and set itself, look more like the period of the 1930s around the end of Prohibition.I also like the later film, for its somewhat different atmosphere. But this is a wonderful comedy. Since it's a fairy tale and a comedy, I suppose a little fraud is OK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Do you believe in fairy tales?" is the question asked in this Damon Runyon story for the screen adaptation re-titled LADY FOR A DAY (Columbia, 1933). Directed by Frank Capra, it's not essentially a fairy tale but a feel-good comedy that would soon become a Capra trait where anyone who has friends is not a failure. The character in question is an old New York City Times Square street peddler named Apple Annie whose association is with that of a superstitious gambler called Dave the Dude. If these characters sound familiar, they've were used again in another Capra comedy, POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES (United Artists, 1961), starring Glenn Ford (Dave the Dude) and Bette Davis (Apple Annie). In fact, it's quite possible that the remake was responsible for keeping the original from circulation. The marque players in the original, Warren William and May Robson, are certainly not those to have survived in memory over the years. They're actors, nonetheless, worthy of recognition for a splendid job they've done under Capra's fine direction in bringing the Runyon characters to life.As the camera captures various street peddlers of Times Square, Apple Annie Dawson (May Robson) is introduced as the "queen" of Broadway to her other peddler friends and boozing old hag selling apples to those who pass her by. Also nearby is Missouri Martin's (Glenda Farrell) night spot where gambler, Dave Manville, better known as "Dave the Dude" (Warren William), feels his winning streak is connected through buying Annie's apples on a daily basis. Little is known about Annie, but is soon revealed as the story progresses. After Annie returns to her home in Shubert Alley, it is soon learned she secretly has a grown daughter, Louise (Jean Parker), whom she hasn't seen since birth, living in Spain. Over the years having arranged for her education and upbringings in a convent, she corresponds with her through the mail using stationery from a luxurious Hotel Marberry, using the name of "Mrs. E. Worthington Manville" on her return address on the envelope. When she receives word that Louise is coming on the next boat to New York to have her meet her fiancé, Carlo (Barry Norton) and future father-in-law, Count Romero (Walter Connolly) from Valencia, Spain, Annie goes into a panic. Thankfully she's got friends to help her through this crisis. Dave repays the old girl who has brought him luck by having Missouri Martin transform her into a grand dame of high society, and having his pals to act as her servants. Judge Henry G. Blake (Guy Kibbee), a noted pool shark, masquerades as her husband, while Dave's bodyguards, "Happy" McGuire (Ned Sparks) and Shakespeare (Nat Pendleton) keep certain nosy reporters away by having them hidden hidden away somewhere in the Bronx. As Annie takes up residence in a luxurious apartment during the absence of its owner, the deception goes well until situations reach a breaking point.With Robson as the central figure as the middle-aged Cinderella, there are areas in its 94 minutes where she disappears during long intervals as the story shifts more towards the subplot of others. There's also a very extended scene where Dave and his friends work out plans in making Annie's reception a success, though an inspector (Robert Emmett O'Connor) steps into the scene to prevent otherwise. One song interlude early in the story, "I Wanna Man," sung by Glenda Farrell, is performed ever so briefly.Considering the leading contenders of William, Kibbee (in a performance probably inspired by W.C. Fields), Farrell and deadpan Sparks all on loan from Warner Brothers studio making this Columbia offering look more like a Warner Brothers product than Columbia, Robson (then on loan from MGM), would, too, become a contract player of Warners (1938-40) before the decade's end. Columbia, a small studio with this success on its hands, earned several Academy Award nominations: Best Actress (Robson); Best Director (Capra); Best Screenplay and Best Picture, but no wins. Though Robson was worthy of the nomination, it's a wonder if the same would have occurred for other elderly actresses had they been played Apple Annie, namely that of MGM's Marie Dressler, Fox Studio's Henrietta Crosman, or even silent screen veteran, Lucille LaVerne, who specialized in playing old hags through much of her career, might have been interesting casting in itself. Robson, a veteran actress herself, finally got the recognition she fully deserved through Apple Annie.Reportedly out of circulation for many decades, I was fortunate to have attended a very rare screening of this nearly forgotten Capra classic at New York City's Regency Theater (Broadway and 67th Street) during a Frank Capra tribute during March-April 1982. With other hard to find Capra films on the double-bill marque, LADY FOR A DAY was truly fulfilled and enjoyed by all to an packed movie house.Cable television would become responsible in bringing this and other early Capra classics back to life again, ranging from American Movie Classics (1989-1994) to Turner Classic Movies (2002-present). Contrary to Leonard Maltin's "Movies on Video" guide published annually, LADY BY CHOICE (Columbia, 1934) also featuring Robson, is not a sequel to LADY FOR A DAY since Robson does not reprise her role of Apple Annie but plays a similar character named Patsy Patterson. Distributed to home video and later DVD, whether anyone believes in fairy tales or not, LADY FOR A DAY is vintage Capra at best still worthy of "once upon a time there was this street peddler named Apple Annie who was to become lady for a day" (***1/2 apples)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May Robson Gets Lucky with Frank Capra</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>New York City gangster Warren William (as "Dave the Dude") thinks buying apples from alcoholic street hag May Robson (as "Apple Annie") bring him luck. The secretive Ms. Robson is supporting both a drinking habit and a daughter, schooled in a Barcelona, Spain convent. When pretty Jean Parker (as Louise) decides to visit, she is expecting mother Robson to be a wealthy society woman, due to Robson's misleading letters. The pressure renders Robson too drunk to panhandle, and Mr. William can't buy his lucky apples.Discovering the problem, William and his underworld pals rally to make Robson the "high society" lady her daughter is expecting. Pool-hustling Judge Guy Kibbee (as Henry Blake) agrees to pose as Robson's courtly husband; and, the duplicitous couple greet Ms. Parker, who arrives with well-heeled fiancé Barry Norton (as Carlos Romero) and his father, Count Walter Connolly. The able gang of supporting players, like wise-cracking Ned Sparks (as Happy), is industriously entertaining; but, the film does slow down during the second half.This was director Frank Capra's first version of apple-yielding writer Damon Runyon's chestnut. Mr. Capra re-made it as his last film, "Pocketful of Miracles" (1961), with Glenn Ford and Bette Davis. This "Lady for a Day" is the superior version; despite the creakier production values, which help give it some of the old-fashioned charm the re-make fails to achieve. Capra's fine direction and Robson's lovely performance placed second in the annual "Oscar" race, after Frank Lloyd "Cavalcade" and Katharine Hepburn "Morning Glory".******* Lady for a Day (9/7/33) Frank Capra ~ May Robson, Warren William, Guy Kibbee, Ned Sparks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Capra Film Establishes That Capra Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though this Frank Capra film came out a year before the beloved director would establish himself as perhaps the most famous director of the 1930s with "It Happened One Night," "Lady for a Day" bears all the hallmarks of what would become that unmistakable Capra style.May Robson gives a sweet and at times heartbreaking performance as Apple Annie, a sidewalk peddler who writes to her daughter, living abroad, of her luxurious lifestyle among New York's upper crust. When the daughter announces that she'll be visiting with her fiancé and father-in-law, who wants to meet his son's intended in-laws before giving his approval to his marriage, Annie is in a panic, and even considers having someone tell her daughter that she is dead. But a gangster acquaintance and his minions come to her aid, making her over and posing as her staff and high society friends.This is a fairy tale as only Frank Capra could tell it. On the surface is a heart-warming story about people who are willing to help others, but at the same time, the very real chasms that separate class from class are never far away. And like "It Happened One Night," though the film isn't directly about the Great Depression, the spectre of it hovers over all.The film also stars Guy Kibbee as a pool hustler who stands in as Annie's husband.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falls Apart in 2nd Half</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lady for a Day (1933) *** (out of 4) Sentimental tale of an apple peddler (May Robson) who hasn't seen her daughter for decades but has been telling her that she's a rich woman living in a fancy hotel. When the daughter comes to visit, the poor woman has nothing to do but a nice gambler (Warren William) decides to turn her into a lady but the plans don't go as expected. I've got rather mixed feelings on this film because I think it starts off brilliantly but slowly goes downhill as the comedy tries to take over. The opening scenes in the hotel with Robson begging for her letter are downright heartbreaking and its moments like these that I love. The final third of the film has William's character taking the spotlight and I think this is where the film goes a little flat. William is very good in his role but everything written around his character is pretty flat. The whole madcap of the police following him on the big night is suppose to be funny but it never made me laugh. The film finally picks up at the very end when Robson must talk to her daughter about the truth. As for Robson, she's terrific in the film and those early moments of her in the hotel are masterfully acted. Guy Kibbee is also terrific as the man who agrees to act as her husband.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Runyon Fairy Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know, I know, lots of contributors mentioned the fairy tale angle, but that's what it is. A story well-done but which stretches the boundaries of believability to excess. I liked it, it was funny and well-acted and can't find a production flaw anywhere. I just get annoyed when a movie asks too much of one's ability to suspend disbelief.Having said all that, I thought the dialogue was great and on the whole the picture was very well-written - hard to quarrel with a combo of Damon Runyon and Robert Riskin. Director Capra kept up the brisk pace throughout and also gathered some of the best character actors in Hollywood to back up its stars. We'll never know how Marie Dressler would have been in the lead, but May Robson was perfect. Always liked Warren William, who struggled to achieve front-line status as an actor.There's a lot to like in "Lady For A Day" and it was very deserving of its AA nominations. A tad too fanciful for my taste, with the understanding it was pure escapist entertainment for depression-era audiences. But that's why they make different flavors of ice cream, right?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Question</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just wondering: is this the movie in which a character says, "I'm going' over to the insane asylum and hobnob with a few sensible people."? What a great line! Since there are other witty quotes listed on previous comments, I figured for sure this quote must have come from Lady for a Day. Was worried I had the wrong source, since there is also a movie called Queen for a Day. Somebody out there let me know which is correct. Though I've not seen the movie, I know it's one that appeals to me because of the number of characters and variety of those character types. The same word keeps coming up: charming...humorous and dramatic. Charming movies do hold up well after so many years...that's why this one sounds so good and is still heard of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who was in charge of casting here?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And why isn't this mentioned in the "goof" section?In a movie, supposedly taking place in New York, has EVERY SINGLE rank of the NYPD, from patrolman, to detective, even up to the commissioner, talking with some hokey Midwestern accent? I'm guessing, but I believe this was shot in NYC itself- you mean the casting director couldn't have found a few New York sounding guys to play the rolls of policeman (or better yet, some ACTUAL members of the NYPD from the thirties)? I left this identical criticism for "The Penguin Pool Murder Mystery" and sure enough, I was the ONLY one who pointed this out.Shame on him, and shame on all you reviewers for missing this obvious mistake.Otherwise, a pretty good movie, but what an unnecessary and easily fixed goof this was.</fullReview>
