		<shortDescription>Bette Davis Stars as Ann Margaret's Misfit Mother</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apple Annie (Bette Davis) makes her living as a gin-sauced, basket-carrying, apple-selling NYC street woman. This motion picture is in color which makes Davis's famous facial expressions, especially her eyes, all the more effective.The people Apple Annie hangs out with are other street vendors who are social misfits of various sorts; but, they have one thing in common: poverty.Apple Annie is well connected with a mobster known as The Dude. Fortunately, he's superstitious. The tough mobster (Glen Ford) believes Apple Annie's apples bring him daily good luck because she says, "God Bless You," to everyone who buys from her.All along Apple Annie's been writing her daughter on stationary from an upper-crusty city apartment complex, in order to pretend that she's a well-to-do lady. When her daughter, Louise (Ann Margaret, in her film debut) writes that she's coming to the city with her potential fiancé', whose father is a Spanish count, Apple Annie's pretense is not only about to be exposed but it could ruin her only child's chance for marrying well enough so that she'll never live in poverty as her mother has.The rest of the story is fabulous: humorous, ingenious, well-casted, scripted and acted. It's anything but a typical mob story.For me, the priceless scenes are between the veteran actor Bette Davis and upstart Ann Margaret. Imagine being able to claim that in your first film you starred as Bette Davis's daughter? Margaret gives a fine first film performance face-to-face with the Queen of the Screen. Peter Faulk does his mobster version of "Columbo," in top form. Davis, in Technicolor, delivers one of the most realistic, heart-felt, truly dramatic metamorphosis characters I've seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pocketful of Wonderful Miracles ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Glenn Ford and the late Hope Lange in a comedy with Bette Davis taking a supporting role. Interesting enough, this crowd pleaser works quite well.Dave The Dude (Ford) is a gangster on the verge of making a big deal. Dave is superstitious. He always must get an apple from that vagrant-looking Davis.Davis, as Apple Annie, was phenomenal in this film. She acts just like an old broken down bag-lady. She does it with a finesse. (Is it really possible to have a refined bag-lady, you bet it is.)Anyway, it appears that Davis has a daughter living abroad all these years. Ann-Margret is she and the latter thinks that her mother is high society. Trouble now is that Ann is getting engaged to a count and they're coming to New York to look mom over. Dave and his girlfriend, Lange, fix up Davis to make her look like a dowager. They even provide a husband for her-Thomas Mitchell!As if this isn't funny enough, we have Peter Falk, in a truly worthy Oscar nominated supporting performance, as Dave's sidekick who can't fathom what is going on.Edward Everett Horton is the butler who can't take bad endings. Fortunately, for him, the film has anything but that kind of ending. It's up-beat down to the last laugh.When "the kids" sail away, Apple Annie resorts to her old ways by even announcing that her prices have gone up to her faithful friends.A romp and memorable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Fairy Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apple Annie (Bete Davis) is an alcoholic beggar who sells apples and controls the beggary in Broadway area. Dave the Dude Conway (Glenn Ford) is a prominent gangster, who believes that Annie's apples are magic and brings `good luck' to him. Elizabeth 'Queenie' Martin (Hope Lange) is his lover, and she wants to get married with him and move to Maryland, to have children. One day, Annie receives a letter from her daughter Louise (Ann Margret, making her debut on the screens), who lives in Spain. She informs that she is going to get married with the son of a Count, and her future father-in-law is coming to New York with them to visit her. Annie becomes desperate and Dude decides to help her, pretending she is from the high-society of New York. This is another wonderful Frank Capra's magic movie. Indeed, it is a fairy tale. The cast, direction and screenplay are delightful and although being talkative and long, it is such a good film that the viewer does not feel the time passing. Bete Davis has another outstanding performance, as usual, very well supported by the magnificent cast. Highly recommended as a family entertainment. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): `Dama Por Um Dia' (`Lady For a Day')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching drama,witty comedy and a drop of a fairy tale combined in another Capra's magical film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can think only of three directors who were capable of blending drama and comedy in a way that makes you applaud after the film ends.Billy Wilder,his mentor Ernst Lubitsch and of course,Frank Capra.Pocketful of Miracles(1961)is Capra's final feature and he ended his glorious career in a truly miraculous fashion.I have read many reviews which pointed out many flaws of this film,but I have to disagree.There are many elements that make this film a true masterpiece.Firstly,the screenplay based upon the story by Robert Riskin and Damon Runyon is wonderful--it is filled with witty one-liners that make you laugh and cry,and it embodies the spirit of Broadway.It is wrong to say that this film doesn't make you think after seeing it-it is much more than just a morality story,with tastefully and artistically presented characters.Secondly,there is absolutely top-notch cast,most of the actors make truly memorable performances(except for Peter Mann,who was rather stiff).Glenn Ford is a fantastic,somewhat forgotten actor,who embodied Dave the Dude superbly.As a prominent gangster and bootlegger who has a thing for Annie's apples,he is simultaneously tough,ironic,charismatic,and incredibly charming in his obstinacy and tenacity.Bette Davis again demonstrates why she was considered the best actress ever.She masterfully portrayed the complex and nuanced character of an alcoholic beggar who controls the beggary on Broadway.She actually shows that even a beggar can be stylish.And the love she has for her daughter Louise-that's magical.Beautiful Hope Lange is great(as always)in the role of Dave's lover Queenie,who wants to move to Baltimore with him and have children.Her change of heart towards Annie is wonderful.The supporting cast is adorable.Peter Falk deserved an Oscar for his inspirational and truly funny portrayal of a distrustful gangster Joy Boy.Thomas Mitchell made his last performance as a pool-hall-junkie-judge who stands in for Annie's husband.And he did it exceptionally.Ann Margret makes her debut as Annie's loving daughter.The direction is flawless,as usual when Capra is in charge.All these elements should make this film an unforgettable experience,and not just a film you watch for fun(no classic film lover should watch films just for fun). I agree that Lady for a day is a great,memorable film,special in many ways.But,the significance of Pocketful of Miracles should in no way be diminished on account of being a re-make.The sixties differ greatly from today,when irritating blockbusters,re-makes sequels and comic-book adaptations unfortunately prevail.Pocketful of Miracles is a must-see for any Capra lover,classic film lover in general,and for all the people who still believe in miracles.I'm one of them and I truly believe that both Hollywood and Europe will live again through the films who would touch the people over the mental age of three,if you know what I mean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capra Remakes Himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With "Pockeful Of Miracles" Frank Capra remakes his own "Lady For A Day" with Capraseque results - that means a mix bag with mostly delightful stuff in it - The major problem here is Glenn Ford, not as an actor but as a producer. There is too much dedicated to Ford's character's businesses, moving away from what really matters - Apple Annie and her predicament. Bette Davis was one of the major supporters of Glenn Ford at the beginning of his career - A Stolen Life, did for his career what "Thelma and Louise" did for Brad Pitt's and one should remember that Davis sort of "imposed" Ford for that role. Now Glenn Ford bills himself above Bette Davis. That should tell you something. The film, however, more than survives the petty egos and comes out as a wonderful swan song for the extraordinary Frank Capra. Bette Davis herself confessed to have found enormous difficulty at being faithful to Apple Annie in those gorgeous gowns post-makeover, but this is, was and always will be a fairy tale and as such it succeeds beautifully. The entrance of Davis after the make-over scored with the Nutcracker suite, it's one of my most cherished movie memories as are Davis's eyes as she witnesses the "miracle" in first person. A collection of wonderful character actors: Thomas Mitchell, Ellen Corby and in particular Edward Everett Horton makes the whole thing a smashing pleasure. Beautiful Hope Lange is terrific and Peter Falk wears a coat that makes his character a shady relative of his future "Colombo". If you're not made of stone and/or your levels of cynicism have not reached inhuman stages, you're going to enjoy this very much. I certainly did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart and Joyfull, made in Capra</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to watch this movie once and again when I was a child. Didn't even know who Bette Davis or Frank Capra were, but already loved the film. The story is a remake of one of Capra's films of the 30's. Easy to follow, filled with smart humor and better acting. I admire the transformation of Bette Davis, great work along with wardrobe and make up departments! Last Capra's film, it has the typical characteristics of his career. The importance of emotions, the rhythm, the magic and the happy ending. It was the beginning of the future sex-symbol Ann Margret in a great and extensive cast. It's a great movie to watch with kids, or for cinema addicts looking for a rest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Heartwarming Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bette Davis turns in a great performance as "Apple Annie". Peter Falk, as has been noted, gets the best lines. Glenn Ford shows his talent for comedy. The young Ann-Margret is as cute as can be. But if i can be permitted a bit of Trivial Observation: I had to watch the next to last scene (the police-escorted motorcade) again because i could not believe it on the first viewing. Did anyone else notice the rear projection in the back windows of the cars? The story is set in the 1930's, the cars are of that era but the automobile following in the back window looks like a 1950 Cadillac! Either that car window was a time tunnel or someone used the wrong film clip for the rear projection. That's why studios have a Continuity Department.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was also a remake of a film made in 1933 called Lady For a Day with Warren William and Mae Hopson. But it was an excellent remake. I especially liked Peter Falk's portrayal in this film. The entire cast is really top notch.I don't think anything is as good as the original. But, this film comes very close. The cast is really what makes this version so good. Bette Davis is excellent as is Glenn Ford and Thomas Mitchell. This is also an early film for Ann-Margaret.I, personally, would recommend this film as highly as I would Lady For a Day. By all means, watch both films. They each have an ambiance that makes both movies unique.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Existing in a Damon Runyon universe this charmer has only the most ephemeral touch in common with the real world but is that necessarily what you watch a Frank Capra movie for? Let the whimsical spirit of the film carry you along and it's most beguiling. Bette Davis' guttersnipe perhaps too easily transforms into a regal lady but she is wonderful here no matter. The whole cast is swell actually with many standouts, Peter Falk is a riot as Joy Boy and received an Oscar nomination for it. The picture's happy nature is infectious and it you roll with it by the end you'll have a smile on your face. While the costume and set design may not be accurate it's certainly high class and sumptuous. A pleasure from another era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfocused Remake of Lady for a Day.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a director who made some of the most memorable, high-quality films between 1933 and 1941 and has become legendary for his priceless, classic IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES is a little too unfocused and cute at times to merit being a great film. While his earlier version, LADY FOR A DAY, was more compact, this one runs 40 minutes too long, extends scenes that could have trimmed the fat off the plotting and still have had the film look great, and seems too fairy-tale even for 1961 when it was released. Somehow what worked so well in the 30s fails to work here, and while the acting couldn't be better from many of the actors involved, the storyboarding itself is sub-par. Bette Davis shines as Apple Annie, though, and makes this escapist film worth watching even when its subject matter has not aged well and seems like a caricature of its earlier version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who loves the Christmas season and all the "smarmy-ness" that goes with it will love this movie. It was beautiful to see the "bad guys" go all out to help Apple Annie. I look forward to seeing it every year during the holidays. Bette Davis, as always, gives a great performance (even in "B" movies). I probably have watched "Pocketful of Miracles" 20 times and will continue to watch any time I catch it on the boob tube and watch it on my VCR. I don't want to give away the plot but it will have all the expectations of a "B" movie. Still, it is enjoyable and will brighten the holiday season with a feeling of love, friendship, happiness and goodwill toward all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"She's like a cockroach what turned into a butterfly!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra's final feature film is a remake of his earlier movie Lady for a Day, one of my favorite movies from the '30s. The story is about an elderly street peddler named Apple Annie who is turned into a society matron by a gangster named Dave the Dude. The original movie starred May Robson and Warren William, both largely forgotten today except among classic film fans. This one has more well-known stars, Bette Davis and Glenn Ford, but isn't as good. It just isn't as much fun and doesn't have the same heartwarming quality the original did. Davis and Ford are okay but represent a change in the times I'd say. Davis' Annie is ghoulish and Ford's Dave is hard to like. The charm of the previous film, made in a much different era for filmmaking, is gone. Also the original movie was made during the period it was set in, which gave it a feeling of authenticity this one doesn't have. On the plus side, Peter Falk and Hope Lange are good in supporting parts, Ann-Margret is fine in her screen debut, and reliable vet Thomas Mitchell enjoyable as ever in his final film. Lots of old familiar faces like Sheldon Leonard, Edward Everett Horton, Barton MacLane, and Jerome Cowan is another plus. It's overlong and not among Capra's best but certainly something fans will want to see. I recommend seeking out the 1933 classic first, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" Apple Annie's Second Time Around "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pocketful of Miracles is Frank Capra's Technicolor re-make of his brilliant 1933 film, Lady for a Day. The same enchanting story only this time set during the Christmas season for delivering a miracle to the grey-haired Cinderella. The remake is rather brash and a little dragging in places when compared to the original, nevertheless still an entertaining and fun film. Bette Davis turns in a good portrayal of Apple Annie as does Glenn Ford playing gangster, Dave the Dude. Peter Falk makes the most of his role, his performance of Joy Boy is absolutely superb. Beautiful Hope Lange plays Dude's girl Queenie Martin and the film debut of a very young Ann-Margret playing Apple Annie's charming daughter Louise. What really makes this film fun is a host of amazing character actors of the time, Edward Everett Horton, Mickey Shaughnessy, Sheldon Leonard, Thomas Mitchell, Ellen Corby, Arthur O'Connell and many more recognizable faces. Although I prefer the original 1933 film, this 1961 remake adequately exudes its own amount of charm.</fullReview>

This was helped with the likes of Peter Falk. The various scenes with the cast of characters involved in selling or begging were very good.

		<shortDescription>Capra's Hilarious Heartwarming Swansong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Capra was definitely one of the best known 'romantic' directors of his time. While I immensely enjoyed his 'It Happened One Night', his 'It's a Wonderful Life' (it has been said that this is Capra's best work) did not appeal to me. A 'Pocketful of Miracles' is more of a fairy tale comedy. The title highly appealed to me and how can one say no to a film with Frank Capra and Bette Davis? The film isn't without its share of drawbacks so let's get those out of the way. At times I felt the focus was too much on the Dude when it should have delved deeper into Apple Annie and her struggle. I also thought the ending was slightly rushed and I really wanted to see more of what happened to Apple Annie and the others.The strength of 'Pocketful of Miracles' is its original humour. The writing, especially of the dialogues, is terrific. The characters are a delight. All the actors are superb. Bette Davis is amazing and even though her character isn't fully fleshed in the second half, she performs with grace and poise. Glenn Ford is quite good. Hope Lange is stunning. Ann Margret is cute. Peter Falk provides some great laugh out loud moments. Thomas Mitchell, Ellen Corby and Edward Everett Horton are great.In addition, 'Pocketful of Miracles' is very pleasing to the eyes. The colourful sets, flashy costumes and lavish interiors that highlight the glamour are very appealing.With this heartwarming swansong, Capra has made me laugh out loud for more than two hours and that more than compensates for the flaws. What a way to say farwell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film with many unique characteristics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Runyonesque era films rarely interest me. I made an exception for the Clan in "Robin And The Seven Hoods".I didn't expect this film to catch my fancy either, but there are enough unique aspects to this film to make it well worthwhile watching.1. This has to be the strangest choice of a role ever made by Bette Davis. Even stranger than "Baby Jane". So, it's worth watching this film just to see Bette Davis in this most unique role. And, although it certainly plays against her "type", she does superbly.2. This was the last film project for director Frank Capra. And yes, it is "Capracorn", but I usually enjoy "Capracorn".3. This was also the last film for the wonderful character actor Thomas Mitchell, a veteran of Capra films, including "Lost Horizon".4. A good performance by Hope Lange.5. The big screen debut of Ann-Margaret.6. An elderly Edward Everett Horton, another veteran of other Frank Capra films going way back to "Lost Horizon". Not to mention a number of other well-recognizable character actors.So what's to criticize? Well, it is a bit longish -- 2:16 minutes, and I think some of the early scenes could have been edited a big. And the ending seemed hurried and a bit illogical. Aside from that, if you like Runyonesque stories -- and perhaps even if you don't -- you should give this film a look. As I indicated, there are many unique features to it...enough to make it nearly an historic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frank Capra's final Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Pocketful of Miracles is a sparkling 1961 comedy, based on a Damon Runyan work, that was the final directorial assignment of the legendary Frank Capra. It is actually a remake of a 1933 film called Lady for a Day.This film stars Glenn Ford as Dave the Dude, a highly superstitious gangster who buys an apple every day from a peddler named Apple Annie (Bette Davis) because he believes her apples bring him good luck. One day, Dave panics when Annie is not at her usual spot peddling her wares. Upon tracking her down, he learns that she is frightened because she is about see her daughter Louise for the first time since she was a child. Louise has been living a luxurious life in Spain with a wealthy Count and his son, to whom she is engaged. Annie admits to Dave that she has exaggerated about her life in the letters that she has written to her daughter, so Dave, with the assistance of his moll, Queenie Martin (Hope Lange) decide they are going to make Annie appear like a queen for her daughter's visit.This classic comedy effortlessly utilizes Damon Runyan-like characters in a warm family story that is irresistible. Davis has rarely been so warm and vulnerable on screen and it is fun seeing her reunited with Ford for the first time since the 1941 melodrama A Stolen Life. Peter Falk received a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his hilarious performance as Joy Boy, Dave's stooge. The impressive supporting cast includes Arthur O'Connell, David Brian, Edward Everett Horton, Sheldon Leonard, and Thomas Mitchell. Ann-Margret makes her film debut here, playing Louise, but the most pleasant surprise here is the performance by Hope Lange as Queenie Martin....this kind of character is such a refreshing change of pace for Lange. Queenie is brassy and unsentimental, a stark contrast from the "Cut-my-arm-off-if-it-will-make your-life-easier" characters that she usually played.For a film that is almost 60 years old, this film still impresses thanks to an entertaining story, a sterling all-star cast, and the directorial magic of Frank Capra.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Davis is wonderful. Confused about ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often people say these older movies are too smarmy and sweet, but thats the reflection of a generation raised on violent hard hitting films. Films of this era were about escapism from the harsh reality of the world outside the theater. They were a kind of childish hope for a world that could never be for the audience of that time. That said, Bette Davis gives a fantastic performance in this film. I watched it over and over again just to see the master at her craft. She plays the last half of the film as if she's stunned in a dream state, unable to quite grasp the kindness shown her. An element of fear of being found out, trying to pull off the elegance of a lady of stature, yet never loosing the the character of the first half of the film. She manages to pull off being a lady more from being shell shocked than from any real attempt by her character to try to be something she is not. I half hoped she would tell the truth to the count toward the end. Its a lovely film and is right up there with I remember Momma as one of my favorite films of this time. One thing I didn't quite understand that I hope someone here might can help me with. I have a 30 year old TV so I have a authentic experience watching these old movies. I suppose. The problem being the sound quality is horrible. That may have more to do with my aging ears but I'd rather blame it on the set.As a result I missed a lot of dialog toward the end and I couldn't figure out what the payoff for attending the party was for the Mayor and Governor. I felt as if an entire scene were missing between Dude and the officials. Did he turn in the mob boss he had been hauling around in the semi? Did he give himself up? Or was this just a Capra miracle that is never quite explained and we're to think that they were touched by Apple Annies story and wanted to do the right thing by her? I'm interested in what others with better viewing equipment took away from the end of this film.</fullReview>

Great performances from Bette Davis, Peter Falk, Thomas Mitchell, Edward Everett Horton, and other vintage character actors. Ann-Margret, who has grown into a wonderful actress, is god-awful as the ingénue. Many nice Frank Capra touches and 1920s Damon Runyon flavor. A charmer if you're in the right mood. This was Capra's last film as a director and is a remake of his 1933 film "Lady for a Day," which is also enjoyable, although I prefer this remake mostly for Davis's performance. Glenn Ford has never been a favorite of mine, but he is good as Dave the Dude and seems to be relishing the opportunity to play comedy.

The story revolves around Dave The Dude (Glenn Ford), a gangster, who is connived into helping Apple Annie (Bette Davis), a down and out panhandler, into perpetuating an aristocratic facade to fool her daughter and fiancee. It is the wonderful script and the great character developments that make this movie. We come to feel for Apple Annie, even though we know she is a bum and a liar. And there's a soft spot for Dave The Dude in spite of his mobster dealings. We hope and pray he does the right thing. Surrounded by a terrific supporting cast (in particular Peter Falk and Hope Lange), this movie weaves an almost fairy-tale like scenario. This is quite simply classic Capra fare that can</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of Capra's own lady for a lady, made in 33. This stars Bette Davis as a panhandler who's daughter thinks she's rich and famous and Glenn Ford is a gangster friend of Davis who helps her out, despite his own troubles. Glenn Ford and Bette Davis are both good and Peter Falk was nominated for best supporting actor. This was Frank Capra's and Thomas Mitchell's last film, whom the latter died of cancer a year later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasing and charming movie well directed by Frank Capra</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film centers about Bette Davis , an old , ugly and poor woman called Annie on his own resources , she splits luck to a mobster played by Glenn Ford giving him apples . Ford helps her and he sets up a masquerade for her daughter Louise - Ann Margret's first movie - , who has lived all her life in a Spanish convent, is coming to America and she goes to marry to a high class man and for him to believe than Bette/Annie is a countess .In the film there is a mingle of comedy , drama and humor , it's a very amusing movie . Although this is not as good remake as ¨ Capra's Lady for a day ¨ , the former and early classic movie . First-range acting , especially by main actors : Bette Davis , Glenn Ford , Hope Lange , Peter Falk , Ann Margret but the secondary actors are also excellent : Edward Everett Horton , Thomas Mitchell , Arthur O'Connell , among others . Before Bette Davis accepted the role, Shirley Booth was Capra's first choice for boozy as well as brassy Apple Annie . Booth viewed the original version of the film, ¨Lady for a day¨(1933) , and informed director Frank Capra that there was no way she could match the Oscar-nominated performance of May Robson in the original film, and politely declined the role . According to the Bette Davis biography, 'Fasten Your Seatbelts', the actress was furious when she read a Glenn Ford interview in which the actor claimed to have gotten her the part because of the boost she had given him years before . After Glenn Ford was cast he helped finance the movie through his production company and he asked his sweetheart Hope Lange as Queenie . Direction by Frank Capra , in his last film , is very good , he had a lot of experience because of his previous classic films, such as ¨It's a wonderful life¨, ¨ Meet John Doe ¨, ¨ Mr Smith goes to Washington ¨ and several others. Rating : 7 , above average , well worth watching .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pocketful of Miracles is a wonderful fairytale with a telling social comment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Betty Davis, Glen Ford, Hope Lange, and Peter Falk (best supporting actor?) come together under Frank Capra to bring a wonderful story to the screen. Set in the early 1930's, during the end of Prohibition, the movie focuses on the "other side" of society... from the panhandlers on the street to the very top of the underground economy.Pocketful of Miracles is a wonderful fairytale about a man who began with nothing and went all the way to the "top", only to be rescued by his lady, with help from Apple Annie, "The Little People", and a miraculous coming together of events. Though perhaps not among his best movies, from a critics point of view, Pocketful is more real than Mr. Smith and deeper than Wonderful Life. Snuck inside the movie is a telling comment about the future, made by Darcy (public enemy #1) .... "We are going to cater to all human weaknesses".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in the theater when released originally. I find it a highly enjoyable movie. I liked seeing Glenn Ford out of the sagebrush. I though he was very credible. The too funny Peter Falk and Mickie Shaugnessey was a hoot. I generally have not been a fan of Bette Davis. In this movie role I felt she was highly believable in her portrayal. Ann-Margaret as the ingenue was fair enough. The usual cast of gangsters was the fine supporting cast as usual. I have always liked Thomas Mitchell. Here it is just another turn of his drunken, once great person down on his luck. Very much as pere O'Hara in GWTW. The pairing of Capra doing his treatment of a Runyon story is a natural.This movie is one of my fond memories of childhood movie going.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The World's A Bright And Shiny Apple That's Mine, All Mine."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra got out of the directing feature film business right after Pocketful of Miracles, creating a symmetry of sorts in his career because this is a remake of Lady for a Day, his first film to garner any kind of award nominations. He felt that it was a mistake going into partnership with a star, in this case Glenn Ford because it meant yielding creative control of the product. You never know what you get with collaborative efforts. It could be something like Gone With The Wind or Mister Roberts. Or it could be something as disastrous as Desire Me (go check my user comments on that one). Pocketful of Miracles falls somewhere in the middle of that. I still remember seeing it and enjoying it as a lad.Originally Frank Capra wanted to do Pocketful of Miracles with Frank Sinatra with whom he had done good work in A Hole in the Head. Sinatra proved unavailable except to record the title song for a best selling record with a kid's choir. Lady for a Day back in 1933 boasted the performance of May Robson as the disheveled Apple Annie who has the secret daughter in a convent school in Spain. All the panhandlers and street grifters chip in and support the girl who's about to marry into nobility. But she wants to visit her mother before the vows are taken. She thinks Robson is a society matron.Stepping in and doing more than an adequate job in the remake is Bette Davis. Capra did put a curb on the Davis grand manner during her scenes as the apple seller in Depression era New York. And he gave her free reign as society matron, Mrs. Worthington Manley.Robson got an Academy Award nomination for Lady for a Day. Pocketful of Miracles boasts an acting nomination itself in the Supporting Actor category. In this case for Peter Falk as Glenn Ford's second in command in his gang. Capra had nothing but praise for Falk as an actor in his memoirs. I agree, the man's range is astonishing, he's capable of a lot more than Lieutenant Columbo.Capra gathered his usual outstanding group of identifiable supporting players including a few who've seen service with him before. This film marked the farewell performance of Thomas Mitchell who graced so many classic films for Frank Capra and others. He's wonderful as the smooth talking pool shark that Ford drafts into being Davis's husband.One career ends, another begins; this was the debut film for Ann-Margret playing Davis's daughter. She even gets to sing to her intended, a rather stiff young actor named Peter Mann of whom little was heard after this. Both were given billing as being introduced in Pocketful of Miracles.Both Lady for a Day and Pocketful of Miracles were based on a Damon Runyon short story and Runyon certainly lavished love on the Broadway characters he created. One of the problems I've always had with both versions of this story is that for all everyone's good intentions which surprise everyone, a fraud is being perpetrated here. Will there be a happily ever after ending when it's discovered? I guess the moral of the story is that if you get enough VIPs involved in the fraud it's OK. That's not a great lesson to learn.But when written by Damon Runyon and directed by Frank Capra it's not something we think about too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woefully sentimental comedy-drama directed by a sadly out-of-touch Frank Capra, here remaking his own 1934 picture "Lady For a Day" but not updating it much--"Pocketful of Miracles" plays just like 1934. Bette Davis looks lost in extravagant but unconvincing role of a straggly street-peddler who is turned into a grande dame by petty gangster Glenn Ford in order to fool her jet-setting daughter. Supporting players Peter Falk, Jack Elam, Ellen Corby and Ann-Margret in her film debut add some sparkle to the heavy-handed proceedings, but Ford is smug and tiresome as Dave the Dude, Hope Lange colorless as floozy singer Queenie. The picture drags on and on, and when the finale finally arrives it is flatly-handled. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Frank Capra directed film is actually Capra's second attempt with the movie. POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES is actually a remake of LADY FOR A DAY (1933), and I've got to say that nothing in this remake made me favor it over the original. May Robson and Warren William just did a better job with the material than Bette Davis and Glenn Ford. In particular, Ford is more selfish and nasty when compared to the "nice" scoundrel played more gracefully by William. Plus, overall, it looks like everyone just tried and emoted too much in the remake. The original was slow and graceful and also quite beautiful. The remake is just LOUDER and brash--like it is a "dumbed-down" version of the original.However, despite my complaint, the basic story itself is still excellent and couldn't help but produce a good movie. This one is sure worth watching, but if at all possible, find LADY FOR A DAY--it's a much better example of the magic of Frank Capra.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colorful Fable That Suffers By Comparison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a scene-by-scene remake by Frank Capra of his 1933 Depression-era classic "Lady for a Day." By itself, this is an enjoyable and supremely colorful tale of redemption and generosity. Unfortunately, it suffers by comparison with the original and plays as a dumbed-down version that has no soul.Glenn Ford plays Dave the Dude, a flamboyant mobster who relies for his luck on Apple Annie, played by Bette Davis. Transformation-type roles are difficult to pull off, and this is not one of Davis' better turns. She doesn't inhabit the character as emotionally as May Robson did in the original. Once she "transforms" into a society lady, she loses the character completely and leaves all traces of the original Annie behind. Peter Falk is the real standout, playing Ford's sidekick Joy Boy who has a wisecrack at every turn and several funny bits early in the film (he virtually disappears midway through, and the film suffers noticeably.Unlike in the original, the rest of the supporting cast is fairly dull, especially Ann-Margret as Louise. How they could make a young and vivacious Ann-Marget dull is beyond me, but they managed it. Sheldon Leonard is wasted as "Big Boss" Steve Darcey, and aging Edward Everett Horton should have been in the original, not the remake. Thomas Mitchell does OK as Judge Henry G. Blake, though Guy Kibbee set the standard in the original version. Several casting choices are just eccentric. Arthur O'Connell as a Spanish Count? He chews the scenery with gusto, and is a hoot to watch mangling a Spanish accent, but who came up with that winner?Ford is the empty center of the film. He does not come across as a powerful mobster figure at all, and ultimately has to do a lot of arm-waving and vigorous gesturing to get people to do what he wants when all it should take is a look. Some of the characterizations are interesting in their own right, and the addition of vivid color makes this watchable, but except for Falk and the splendid color, everything in this version is inferior compared to the original. Yes, everything. Everything!They kept the same dialog as in the original in the majority of the scenes, but sometimes it doesn't work because of different acting styles and mannerisms. Dialog fashioned to refer to actors' particular characteristics is retained despite the fact that there are different actors - I'm sorry, that is plain silly. The wit and originality of the original is replaced by style and flashy production values, and it doesn't work for me. A lesson in the pitfalls of doing remakes for no discernible reason except to "upgrade" the product.Almost everyone involved in this project did much, much better work elsewhere. Worth viewing for the tale itself and the colorful atmosphere, but better off seeing the original instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capra comes a cropper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pocketful of Miracles, Frank Capra's 1961 remake of his 1933 hit Lady For a Day, would be his last film, and it's not hard to see why. It feels stretched out at 137 minutes, as if intended as a musical a la Guys and Dolls only to have the songs dropped at the last minute, and Bette Davis' Apple Annie is very, very hard to root for. While May Robson in the original had an edge behind the sweet old lady act, Davis chooses to play her as a vicious drunken thug no-one in their right minds would put themselves out for, let alone go to enormous lengths to pass off as a member of New York high society so that the daughter she hasn't seen in years can marry a Spanish aristocrat. It's a performance so horrendously misjudged you have to wonder not only what was she thinking but why Capra didn't have a quiet word with her. He should have just waited until Helen Hayes (his original choice) was available instead - she could have pulled the part off in her sleep. Davis is such a total bitch in the film you keep on hoping someone will drive a stake through her heart.Co-producer Glenn Ford struggles and loses as Dude the Dave, his usual charisma largely gone AWOL here and replaced by too many broad and unconvincing frustrated mannerisms, though Hope Lange fares better as his girl, Thomas Mitchell has a few nice moments in his last screen role and Peter Falk is an entertainingly exasperated sidekick. While there's certainly room for improvement in the original, the film never manages it. The script isn't as witty (Edward Everett Horton's butler never gets a line as good as Halliwell Hobbs' "If I had choice of weapons with you, I'd choose grammar" in the original), once again Capra shows that colour was not one of his fortes and strangest of all, despite the added running time it has less of the flavor of Damon Runyon's short stories than not only the original but any other Runyon screen adaptation. It's certainly watchable enough and not half as dragged out as Jackie Chan's remake Miracles, but despite the odd moment here and there it's nothing that'll stick in your memory.</fullReview>

I didn't find this film heartwarming at all. Why was everyone so willing to help Apple Annie? This question was never answered for me. The gruffness of Apple Annie comes across well. Her physical appearance (before the makeover) is just awful? Did they have to make her look quite so bad? I didn't see any genuine sweetness in her at all, except towards her daughter, Louise. Just because she said "God bless you" and sometimes exempted her friends from paying what amounts to shakedown money? In the final scene, Apple Annie says to her street friends, "I'm going to have to ask you for an extra $1 a month." After they went above and beyond to help Annie out of her predicament?! I fail to see any redeeming quality in Ms. Davis' portrayal of Apple Annie or in this film. It leaves me cold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capra's Final Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pocketful of Miracles (1961) ** (out of 4) Legendary director Frank Capra's final film had him working with Bette Davis and Glenn Ford in a remake of his 1933 film LADY FOR A DAY. The two films are pretty straight forward in terms of their story. The homeless Apple Annie (Davis) is considered a hero by gangster Dave the Dude (Ford) who believes that her apples bring him luck. Annie eventually is shocked to learn that the daughter she hasn't seen since a baby is coming to visit her with a rich Duke and doesn't want her to know she's homeless. With the help of Dave, Annie transforms into a royal mother. I enjoyed LADY FOR A DAY for its heart and charm but the same can't be said for this overlong remake that just goes on and on and on. The movie runs a whopping 137-minutes, which is about, at least, half an hour too long. This film and the original tell the exact same story but like a lot of remakes from this era, this film has to throw in countless subplots and must expand the film as much as they can and in doing so they kill everything good that it does have going. The main reason to watch this film is for the performance by Davis who really shines in both parts of her character. I found her incredibly touching as the homeless woman and this is especially true during her scene in the hotel where she's trying to get a letter that her daughter wrote her. Davis also does a very good job in the "rich" style and this includes when she first pops out of the bedroom to display her new self. That walk and facial gesture she gives is priceless. Hope Lange, Peter Falk and Ann-Margret, in her first film, all turn in nice supporting performances. The weakest link is Ford, believe it or not. He's a great actor but this role just wasn't right for him. A lot of this is due to the screenplay, which makes him too much of a jerk but even Ford appears to be sleepwalking through a lot of the wondering scenes. Capra's direction is decent throughout and he still knows how to hit the heart but the comedy is lacking and there's certainly no reason for the extended running time. Even though there's some nice stuff here, in the end you can't help but look at this as a disappointment considering Capra, Davis and Ford are doing the work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lady for the Week</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1930s New York City, gin-soaked Bette Davis (as "Apple Annie") sells apples to support both her habit and a beautiful daughter, who is living in Spain. One of Ms. Davis' biggest customers is (conveniently) bootlegger Glenn Ford (as "Dave the Dude"). Mr. Ford believes Davis' apples bring him good luck, and he must buy one before each of his underworld business transactions. "Lady luck" smiles on Ford in the form of nubile Hope Lange (as "Queenie" Martin); they quickly hook up, and she becomes the "blonde bombshell" attraction at Ford's speakeasy.Somehow, Ford and his gangsters survive the repel of prohibition.The plot thickens when Davis receives a letter from lovely long-absent daughter Ann-Margret (as Louise), announcing her voyage to New York City. While paying for her European education, Davis has written fantastical letters to her daughter - so, she is expecting Davis to be a wealthy society lady, not an alcoholic tramp. Needing Davis' apples to sustain his luck, and secreting a heart of gold, Ford and his gangster pals give Davis a make-over, and set her up in a penthouse apartment. Will the deception work? This is filmmaker Frank Capra's last film; and, it is a re-make of his own "Lady for a Day" (1933).While enjoyable, "Pocketful of Miracles" is neither as charming nor successful as was certainly anticipated. Mainly, it's sustained by Davis and a slew of Runyonish supporting characters, including the top-tiered quartet: Arthur O'Connell, Peter Falk (a "Best Supporting Actor" nominee), Thomas Mitchell (in his last appearance), and Edward Everett Horton. Ann-Margret makes an inauspicious film debut; to borrow the title of her then current hit single, "I Just Don't Understand" why Capra didn't make this picture a musical.****** Pocketful of Miracles (12/18/61) Frank Capra ~ Glenn Ford, Bette Davis, Peter Falk, Hope Lange</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit unfocused, but has its moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was Capra's last film. Making it, as I remember, wrecked his health, giving him excruciating migraines for the rest of his life. Being producer and director might have been the reason! The director makes an effort to return to older material, remaking an earlier picture. I can't imagine why. Runyon by the 60s seemed horribly dated and unauthentic. This picture doesn't help much. It seems as studio-bound as 1954's "Guys and Dolls", also based on Runyon material, and it totally misses the flavor of "period" New York. It's almost as if the director wanted to make a 30s picture again, 30 years later. It uses classic 30s character actors, from Capra's films and others, at the end of their careers, which is a nice touch, as it's good to see them. But again, why? Glenn Ford seems totally miscast, but again, as I've said on IMDb before, actors should NEVER choose their own material (he was a producer of this picture) and this is no exception. He insisted on casting his girlfriend, too, and Hope Lange was just too sophisticated for the role of a "moll", though she tries very hard! The other character actors are wonderful, with each having a "turn" to show their best.This is perhaps Bette Davis' best work of her later career: no tricks, no mugging, no posing, no overacting, just straightforward, honest playing, digging into the character and making it work. What a talent.Watching her is the main reason for seeing this picture. But that just might be reason enough!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite "almost great" comedies, with a delightful screenplay, and some magical moments of acting, especially by Peter Falk, Thomas Mitchell, and Edward Everett Horton. The Capra magic is there in many spots, but there are some awful lapses, notably whenever the gangsters are off screen. Capra's decision to cast Ford in the lead pays off surprisingly well for an actor not noted for his comedic talents. But Hope Lang (who was dating Ford at the time) is out of her element in what should have been the brassy role of "Queenie Martin." And two other casting goofs seriously marr the picture: Ann-Margret in a very early role is simply awful, a simpering and cloyingly sweet young thing who makes you wince in pain. And Arthur O'Connell, usually a fine addition to any picture, is hopelessly miscast as a Spanish "Count Romero." Surely the worst foreign accent in a film since Fred Astaire's Russian dancer, "The Great Petroff!"</fullReview>
