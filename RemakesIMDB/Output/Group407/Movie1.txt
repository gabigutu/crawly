		<shortDescription>Interesting remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake is better than I expected. It sticks pretty close to the original but does change a few details here and there. Belushi is surprisingly effective in the Bogart role. The rest of the cast perform well. It's no substitute for the original but it is an interesting alternative take on the story. I don't see this as anywhere near the debacle described by the other reviewer, who was obviously put off by elements of the story that were repeated from the 1943 original. Those were different times. And this film chose to honor those conventions rather than trying to rewrite history to kowtow to current thinking. Whether that was the right move or not is, I suppose, debatable. But I was expecting to hate this film, yet I found myself pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They shall not grow old!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first purchased this movie I just got it because I'm into war films. But after I watched it I was really pleased. James Belushi puts in one of his best performances of all time. Helped along by the rest of the cast including Alan David Lee and Jerome Ehlers.The story is a little slow to start off. You get the impression its about a group of soldiers against the desert. But soon the Germans enter the picture and the true plot of the movie becomes apparent. The best part of the film is the ending sequence. Sgt. Gunn (Belushi) is knelt praying over the graves of his fallen comrades. The poem and the tank driving away is just classic.Top quality film and one of my favorites!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good remake and highly under-rated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was, IMO, one of Belushi's better portrayals. The subject is a part of history seldom touched upon by American movies (the American participation in the African theater against Rommel)and includes the Grant medium tank...a forgotten piece of equipment that shows just how unprepared America was to fight WW2.The movie is well acted. The scenery is excellent and the action flows nicely. The soldiers don't come across as cartoon superheroes or Rambo clones. The rift between the Italian and German forces is portrayed rather nicely too.The equipment is portrayed nicely and the tactics are sound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I am generally against remaking classic movies, I must admit that this TV-movie starring Jim Belushi was very well done and was far better than I expected. And Belushi's fine acting was a delightful surprise, too. I recommend that you see the original with Humphrey Bogart and compare. You'll enjoy both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic pleasure...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sahara is a cinematic pleasure. For fans of Bogart and of James Belushi, this film will excite you. The story may be a little hard to believe that a hand full of men hold off so many Germans, but Hollywood was part of the war effort 1943 and that is to be expected. Besides, whats wrong with wanting to kick a little Nazi butt every now and then? Anyway, the cinematography alone is worth the watching of this movie. Not unlike the desert scenes in Star Wars - Return of the Jedi and those of more recent films like the Mummy and the Mummy Returns, the richness of color and warmth and the brutal sun make for a heightened experience. If you have a chance to watch this film I highly recommend it so you might form your own opinion. After all, it's has to be better than most of the junk out there lately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched this film on cable TV late one night. I stayed up (and awake) to watch the entire thing. After seeing the 1995 incarnation and hearing that it was actually a remake of a 1943 Bogart film I searched for the original(My rental stores are sadly lacking in variety from the classic era). I enjoyed the original even more. AMC and TCM need to air these less well known but excellent films more often.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good remake of a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes 'remakes' aren't; they take liberties with the original. This movie didn't do that, they stuck with a good, simple story of men in war. The original started out as a "allied microcosm" propaganda flick, but turned out to be a good solid war movie. The makers of this version don't mess with what works. Jim Belushi provides a good solid focus as the Humphrey Bogart character ("Joe Gunn"), and is ably assisted by the rest of the cast. Not a grand war movie, to be sure, but a good one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a remake of a 1943 Bogart movie of the same title. I was pleased to see they followed the original story almost to a T. Very well acted for a TV movie &amp; Belushi was great as Joe Gunn. And the other actors were good as well. On the whole an enjoyable remake, which doesn't happen very often. I guess what I am saying is that as a very big Bogey fan I was expecting to be let down by this movie, but surprise surprise, I wasn't. It was reasonably well acted, interesting story this time around as well, followed the original movie very closely, surprisingly well directed &amp; well photographed for a TV movie and once again Belushi does a crack job.

		<fullReview>I am ashamed to say as an ardent film fan I have not seen the original starring Humphrey Bogart. I do however have the luxury of being able to judge this film with an unbiased view. I didn't even realise it was a TV film until I saw the details on the IMDb site. Belushi gives a creditable performance but I think all the characters gel together well and the film carries a certain aura of the old British 40's and 50's war films such as Ice cold in Alex though obviously not in the same league. The characters are doomed and yet you feel for them. At the end as the camera pans across the line of makeshift rifle tombstones and Belushi recites the fourth paragraph of Laurence Binyon's 'The Fallen' you realise that you are not only at the end of a quite good film but also you owe a great debt to the fallen heroes of yesteryear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling and exciting war yarn in which a small Allied detachment is surrounded by a German army</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Acceptable adventure drama set in Libyan desert during WWII dealing with an Allied lost patrol battling Germans . Wartime film with powerful direction including scenarios set in Lybia desert but filmed in Outback desert , being based upon an incident in the Soviet film ¨The Thirteen¨ directed by Mikhail Romm and made about six years prior to this movie . "In June, 1942, a small detachment of American tanks with American crews, joined the British Eighth Army in North Africa to get experience in desert warfare under actual battle conditions. History as proved that they learned their lesson well" . While the WWII raged in Europe American/British troops were fighting in a far part of the world , North Africa . Small solitary patrols from all nations moved over the vast Libyan desert that seemed on fire with the sun . The molten sky gloated over them . The endless desert wore the blank look of death . Yet these men marched on without a murmur , fighting an unseen German enemy who always struck in the dark . Sergeant Joe Gunn (James Belushi , while classic version played by Humphrey Bogart) and his tank (called Lulubelle" ) , crew pick up five British soldiers . The group of Allied stragglers (all of them played by Alan David Lee as Bates , Simon Westaway as Williams , Mark Lee as Doyle , Jerome Ehlers as Halliday), a Frenchman (Michael Massae, an American actor, who was born in Kansas City to French parents, Masse convinced director at the audition) and a Sudanese man (Robert Wisdom , formerly played by Rex Ingram) with an Italian prisoner (D'Angelo) crossing the Libyan Desert to rejoin their army after the fall of Tobruk . A brave group of American and British soldiers rides a tank (it is an M3 Lee, but has features of the variety used by the Australian Army during WW2 , the standard US commander's cupola was deleted from the 37mm turret and a pintle mounted) across the Sahara in search of water and lost in the desert , being shot by Germans , one by one and some battered fighting men battle it out to the finish . They find it among desert ruins , only to realise that 500 Nazi troopers converging on them need it even more . Dead the official commander they are ruled by the sergeant , then arise boiling passions in the burning sands . The bunch works together to vanquish a much larger Nazi army that wishes the same water well that they have .This dusty-looking remake of the Bogart classic gets brief psychological remarks about diverse characters , and although is completely developed on the wide desert , the tale results to be a little claustrophobic . The flick displays fierce action , drama , dominating performances , excitement , contrived heroic deaths and the most entertainment and thrilling scenes come fast in the last reel . Philip MCDonald (story's author being based the movie) had been recruited in the British cavalry during WWI (1917) and he ulteriorly wrote an intrigue and suspense tale , adding his war memories and taking an incident based on the Soviet Photoplay "The Thirteen" . The film contains a powerful and moving musical score . Glimmer and sunny cinematography from Port Stephens , New South Wales, Australia . Nearly all the extras in this film were from the Royal Australian Air Force and The Royal Australian Army. For authenticity, the director made them shave off their mustaches which apparently weren't allowed in the German army in WW2.Good direction by the Australian Brian Tenchard Smith who transfers the action of the story with great effect and fine interpretations make this an entertaining film . This particular story was former and subsequently remade and reworked several times , being originally seen as a Russian movie titled ¨The thirteen¨ . Subsequently by John Ford in ¨The lost patrol¨ with Victor McLagen and Boris Karloff ¨ set in Mesopotamia ; ¨Bataan¨ by Tay Garnett with Robert Taylor in Philippines jungle ; ¨Last of Comanches¨ made by the same studio about a decade later , was loosely based on this movie , realized by Andre De Toth with Broderick Crawford in Califonia desert ; and even part of ¨Flight of Phoenix¨ by Robert Aldrich in Sahara desert . Britain also made a variation on the story titled ¨Nine men¨ . Rating : 6'5/10 . The motion picture will appeal to warfare moviegoers .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a pretty entertaining view in my opinion. I guess this was a remake and I never have seen the orig, so I will only comment on the version on saw. The movie was well done and it had a lot of action. Its your basic Mexican stand off between the Allies and the Germans. The Americans are held up within these ruins in the desert and have to make a live or die last stand. BlaH blah nothing new. What I enjoyed the most had been that all the the Allie countries fighting the war had a single representative in the bunker. Each with their countries own fighting weapon. I gotta a kick outta that part. The movie is just something to look at if you bored and you wont be disappointed if you come across it on HBO one night or find it in a DVD bargain bin.piEce</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too bad that this movie isn't any better known and appreciated. Perhaps it has to do that never hit cinemas or because that it's a remake of the 1943 Humphrey Bogart movie but fact still simply remains that this a good and entertaining little action flick.The movie benefits from its great story. It didn't changed must in regard to the 1943 original but still it changed a couple of sequences and left out the more propaganda like aspects of the original but still leaving in the exaggerated heroism and toughness of the characters, which aren't all very likely but help to make the movie an entertaining one nevertheless. The concept of 9 men standing their ground against an army of 500 is always something that should get your testosterone running.In terms of its acting and visual look it isn't a too impressive looking movie. You feel that with a much bigger budget the movie could had truly turned into a fantastic one, without now calling the movie bad or a disappointment.Its action is simply good. The second halve of the movie gets action filled when the Germans start to attack the ruins that hold the only well within the wide vicinity in it. They don't know however that the well has dried up and the Allies are using it as a decoy so that the Germans can't march on to El Alamien and flank the British stronghold there.It's nothing too impressive, it's simply just a good and entertaining unknown little WW II action flick.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is like one of the classic 60'th and 70'th war movies, where a lot of guys go out to complete a tuff mission and in the end - only one survive, usually the leading character.This is a well-used form of making an adventure movie, used in classics like: "The Magnificent Seven" and the following sequels, "Dirty Dozen" - and even "Saving Private Ryan". Like the first two this movie has excluded all sorts of realism and gains its viewers those that don't know the strength that the German army had - both in the infantry and on the panzer-side - and therefor enjoys this sort of German-army-humiliating-movies, (not that I think that Germany should have won the war).BUT! This movie is OK. It's funny, contains a lot of action and tough it put down the German strength I'm glad to say that the good guys wins. But that was pretty obvious right. No one - especially in America would dare to make a movie where the Germans win. That would be to upgrade the Nazis - and we don't want to do that - do we?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sahara" is a movie which is based on World War II and especially after the fall of Tobruk in June 1942. After that sergeant Joe Gunn leads his tank into the Sahara desert, in order to evade advancing Rommel's forces and reach Allied lines.In this movie we observe the difficulties of these soldier and how they tried to survive and defend. James Belushi who played as Sgt. Joe Gunn made a really unexpected nice interpretation and shows his true acting skills. Although I recommend you to watch first the original movie with Humphrey Bogart and after this remake. After this you will find out that is difficult to compare these two movies.Lastly I have to admit that I did not expect to like this movie because I have watched the original version and I am not a big fan of remakes, although this movie is worth seeing and I truly recommend it.</fullReview>

Stereotypical characterisation doesn't quite cover it! The German commander is nasty, the Italian is a turncoat who doesn't want to fight, the captured pilot is surprise surprise...a fanatical Nazi and racist with an iron cross. The Italian is a turncoat, the Frenchman just wants to sacrifice his own life. A few soldiers would seem to be holding off a whole battalion who simply charge directly at them and get slaughtered - they are supposed to be elite Afrika Korps for ****'* sake! The doctor suddenly becomes an expert with a machine gun, and the stock characters do exactly what's expected of them, with the comic self-sacrificing black guy, arm aloft, holding up a captured medal as he dies - LOL. I won't even mention the laughable scene where the whole German battalion are "moaning".</fullReview>

It's more like a pleasant day trip to the beach. You could overlook the flaws of the original '43 version because of the quality of Bogart and the supporting cast, but not this mob. If you want to see a classic set in the western desert then go for "Ice Cold in Alex" instead of this rubbish. I hope Belushi remembered to drive on the left when he eventually made it back to El Alamein. Never again, please!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Developed after a long series of re-dones. At start with a Soviet Film from the early 30's. A complete collection of all sorts of different characters from all around the World. All with their own personalities, beliefs and perspectives. James Belushi makes one of hes life-time performances for sure i dare to say. He really owns the screen and I'm so in love with hes character. But as mentioned ALL of the more main- characters are unforgivable and all have their deep to explore. The plot where we are supposed to believe that 9 men can stand against 500 with all-round superior firepower... is a bit much for me though. Even if its add to the Drama and the Film is made basically for entertainment. But its the only problem i have with the film. The dialog and humor are world class. When each of them die it feels empty. Also love the fact how they have to spare ammunition,Water and fight practically with small measures. The conclusion is so brilliant. Also a sweet touching message for the fallen soldiers that gives a sad farewell to the film. My personal favorite War-movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The men in this movie are threatened with death by dehydration. Hollywood is already algor mortis because of a dearth of ideas. They're remaking everything, in this case an emblematic movie of 1943 starring Humphrey Bogart. It was a nicely constructed flag waver full of comforting stereotypes.This remake is in color and has more impressive shots of the desert and the tank that is struggling across the dunes. Otherwise -- stay away.I don't know what happened to the industry, but I can take a guess. When the old studios were grinding away back in the 40s when the original appeared, they were run by men who had grown up with the business and could impose their personal values on the products. The Warner brothers cranked out tough message movies. If you wanted a "nice family" movie, Louie B. Mayer at MGM would be happy to accommodate you. A mogul could take a chance on a movie that might not earn its money back just because he LIKED the story.The entire economic structure has changed, and in the same way it's changed in publishing. Jack Warner is dead and so is Charles Scribner. The various production companies are now run by MBAs who think of nothing but the bottom line, preceded by a dollar sign.So we have unchallenging movies now based on cartoon characters, comic book heroes, and even video games like "Battleship." If there were an original idea in Hollywood now it would die of loneliness.The movie is an insult. Pfui.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll defer from the previous opinions that this was a shameless ripoff of Borgart's 1943 film. I see it as a labor of love, a tribute to the spirit that helped The Greatest Generation win the war. James Belushi could not hope to imitate Bogart, so I look to the blow-by-blow recreation of the script as the spark plug of the movie."Sahara" is a work of fiction, but that part of the war was a desperate action, fought by men under harsh and trying conditions. The desert war is overlooked by historians, and little mention is made of the struggle against nature as well as the implacable foe.Like the films of Frank Capra, "Sahara" is optimistic and idealistic to the point of "corniness", but it works by capturing the simple-minded determination of men to fight for their comrades, and to hold their position in spite of the odds. The poetry at the end suggests the tribute: "...they shall not grow old...we shall not forget." With hindsight, we can find faults with the script and the tactical representation of the artificial situation, but not with the grit and determination of the real people who fought the actual war. This re-make of "Sahara" is an anachronism, but one to be respected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ghastly movie - don't bother watching it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film makes one wonder why the Americans hadn't made it to Berlin by the end of 1941. A loudmouthed NCO and a few other Allied soldiers fight off hundreds of German crack troops at a desert well. How on earth did Rommel get to El Alamein? The original, starring Humphrey Bogart, was bad enough, although considering that it was made during the war, it probably served its purpose as a propaganda piece. To do a re-make (and do it thus badly) is simply inexcusable. If Americans learn about the war by watching movies like this one they will fail to understand why it took so long to defeat Hitler. And why should an Australian captain take orders from an American sergeant? It just doesn't make sense. I can well picture a US NCO TRYING to bully a commissioned Australian (or British) officer around - what I can't imagine in my wildest dreams is the officer taking the orders. I suppose the only reason Napoleon lost the Battle of Waterloo was that he didn't have an American sergeant by his side who'd have given him the right orders. What a load of rubbish this film is!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sahara is a good enough movie. Very clichéd. A little too symbolic with the good guys being just too varied a mixture of nationalities. But the story holds your interest. The question though, is who needs it? It's a remake of the classic Humphrey Bogert "Sahara" of 1943. Bogart had a mesmerizing screen presence whenever he was on film. There's no explanation for it, but he did indeed have it. Maybe it was that voice. Or that cool "I'll kick your butt if I need to" attitude he always seemed to convey. But Bogart was impossible to ignore. And he made Sahara in the midst of WWII. No one knew how the war would turn out in 1943. So it was essentially a propaganda film, encouraging the audience with the bravery and never-say-die attitude of the Americans and their allies (hence the convenient mixture of nationalities in Bogart's little group of fighting men). The film served a purpose in 1943 to entertain as well as to give hope to a country involved in a world war.If the movie was to be remade, it should have been with an all-star cast or at least with a major star in the Bogart role. Or maybe to enhance the film with modern film-making techniques. Instead, what we got was practically a carbon copy of the original with a "B" movie actor (James Belushi) in the Bogart role. America needed this movie in 1943. But not in 1991. And for those who still like to watch it, the remake did nothing more than colorize it and substitute a decidedly less gifted actor in the lead role. The rest of the parts were all played by unknowns (at least to this reviewer). At least the original had quality costars in Bruce Bennett, Dan Duryea, Lloyd Bridges and J. Carrol Naish.So if Belushi's Sahara was the one and only version, it would be a decent enough movie. But since it is a cheap, lower quality version of the original classic, why bother?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made but ultimately very flawed film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film showed a lot of promise at the start-the Allies were badly defeated at Tobruk and the death and shell bursts at the beginning were good. Even as it progressed, it was still good. The scenes picking up the African, the Italian and the German were well made and you get a good impression of the desert and the war there- i.e. the awful desolation and the thirst yet also the vast beauty of the Sahara. There are ethical questions of war raised as well (such as shooting/neglect of prisoners and a certain look at the sheer pointlessness of the war--two great armies fighting for sand and a dry well although I realise the capture of Cairo and the Suez would have been brilliant from the German stance.)However, the ridiculous way the story ends, with seven or so Allied troops fending off 500 Wehrmacht soldiers is just plain stupid, a real unbalanced, biased standpoint typical of its genre and just out to please American viewers. I would say 20 of those elite (though thirsty) German soldiers would have wiped out that force in reality in about 20 minutes. And the way all the Germans are portrayed as fanatical Nazis is also wrong as most (esp.in the Afrika Korps)were professional and as ethical as soldiers can be during war. The Allies are made out to be heroic defenders who aren't racist or bad in anyway at all (i.e. when the Texan and Tambul talking down the well).Overall though, for the look (the tanks, explosions, action, etc.),and the thoughts/images of the desert as both beautiful and hellish were good, with good acting from Belushi, Williams (the aussie), and Capt.Haliday (the british doctor) especially.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a bad remake?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an awful remake. They follow the script almost line for line. But they have not an actor who can act. Belushi tries to be Humphrey Bogart and he doesn't even know how to be a soldier. His pot-belly sticking out, he really is bad. The British doctor is such a shell of a character. He is almost plastic. Skip this one and watch the original. As you watch you see the lack of knowledge of World War II. It doesn't seem that the director of this film understand the reason the original film was made. The reason for some many different nationalities was to show the strength in the United Nations. In this film it seems ludicrous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A total waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this movie is not even worth of seeing. The topic is copied from 1943' Sahara. All the characters act like as if they were idiots, they are "the tough men, who will fight for their land, for their families..." The only good scene in this movie is when the Australian guy is shot.....it is really good made and pretty sad. But rest of the movie is just a junk. We can see about 200 German soldiers, out of which some 500 die and another 150 are taken prisoners....well, I wasn't that bad at mathematics, Mr. Director! Of all those hundreds of Germans not a single one is wounded, they are all just dead...just fell down and that's it. Hm, if it was a Soviet movie from the 1932, ok, but an American movie from 1991?!! Shot a few years after Full Metal Jacket and Platoon?!!! All I want to say is: if you like good movies, please, do yourselves a favor and don't watch this! 1 out of 10 (for the scene I've said before)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very one sided, but watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pretty standard war movie, which is to say it's very one sided and anti-Nazi.*** SPOILERS ***A bunch of allied riff raff from all nations, pretty much all cultural stereotypes and led (of course) by an American, get stranded in the Sahara desert when their vehicle breaks and they have to find water. They stumble upon a small source of water and hole up, when a Nazis advance party, also dying from thirst, stumble across them. They kill most of the Nazis and send the survivors back to the main group with the false impression they are guarding a full well of water, when it has already dried up.And here's where it frankly turns really sad. Desperate for water, the thirsty Nazis make sally upon sally upon their fort and die in their droves. The lack of respect for human life here is appalling, even in war time. Now, maybe it's easy to say "oh well, they were Nazis - they deserved it" but it's not that simple. You have to remember that many Nazis really had no choice, and even then, the propaganda at the time was at least as strong as anti-Nazi themes are now. They thought they were on the side of good. And these particular Nazis weren't slaughtering Jews, they were just desperate for a drink. No doubt if a bunch of allied troops dying from thirst were butchered trying to get to water that wasn't even there by a handful of Nazis who'd tricked them, we'd think that was the most evil act in history.*** END SPOILERS ***Standard performances from everyone here, more or less just acting out the stereotypes of their particular nation of origin. The visuals don't deserve much of a mention, since the whole movie is sand, sand and more sand. Overall an average war / men bonding movie with some rather disturbing undertones.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laugh - riot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this masterwork very recently on television and was reduced to tears of laughter. Like many of the other reviewers I remember the original with Humphrey Bogart and Rex Ingram. That may have had some merit based on the time it was made but this woeful piece of rubbish had none. Are we really to find it credible that a battalion of Afrika Korps veterans would be held in check for anything more than 5 minutes by a mish-mash of stragglers of varying nationalities. Apparently so. Apart from the ludicrous premise and cringe inducing sub - plots the acting is appalling. James Belushi is dreadful in the role originally taken by Bogart. Apart from he and the Australian guy playing the officer (so handy with the MG42) I didn't recognise any actor. The kind of comic - book German that should have been left behind in Warlord or Victor is here in abundance. Amazing how there is not a racist sentiment from these worldly - wise stoics when the Sudanese appears on the horizon. Spare me, please.A film to be buried in the Qattara depression methinks...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pointless remake of "The Tank"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A completely pointless remake of the 1942 film "The Tank" starring Humphrey Bogart. The Bogart film at least had some propaganda value in inaccurately depicting US troops in the Battle for Tobruk, which was an almost an entirely Australian affair. The overblown portrayal of all Germans as nasty, fanatical Nazis was frankly laughable. The only believable acting was of James Belushi as a typical loudmouthed American, or was he just playing himself? Surely 50 years after the event we can have some intelligent films about the Second World War.</fullReview>
