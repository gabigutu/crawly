		<shortDescription>Excellent film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shot in the American desert instead of the real Sahara due to the war, this movie is one of the best war films ever made. The desert is so bleak and barren, and the sun so bright, you can almost feel the heat in your living room. Sahara shows us just how brutal the conditions were in North Africa during the war, and how nature brought suffering to both sides. The Allied soldiers are a mix of a lot of different nationalities (American, British, French, South African, Irish, Sudanese) and we see how these men from diverse backgrounds come together to survive against the elements and the Germans. The Germans themselves have the usual stereotyping of nastiness that is found in most films of the 1940s, but even they are shown to be individuals and not a faceless enemy. Get a cool drink and watch Sahara - it's a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A first-rate War film, with a masterful musical score...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sahara" is a first-rate War film, well directed by Zoltan Korda, which qualitatively balanced its superb action sequences with penetrating character studies? Bogart is seen as a tank commander who, when separated from his unit in the Libyan Desert, picks up a group of allied (and eventually several enemy) stragglers and heads out in search of badly needed water? Once they arrive at a nearly dry oasis, and after he learns that a motorized battalion of Germans is also after the water, Bogart decides to make a valiant stand? Bogart's characterization is excellent as he gave what many considered to be the most realistic portrait of the truly "American" fighting man yet pictured on the screen? Assisting in the overall success of "Sahara" was a masterful musical score by Miklos Rozsa, who did similar duty the same year in another "tank" picture, Billy Wilder's "Five Graves to Cairo."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent WWII movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sahara" is interesting from several standpoints. First, it is an excellent drama, well acted and directed, with good production values. Second, it raises an interesting moral question. Third, it has implications regarding the main actor and his future movie career."Sahara," the story of a rag-tag group of soldiers fleeing from Rommel's Afrika Korps in a US tank, is enjoyable throughout. The cast is fine, representing a number of nationalities and even races. I think this is one of Bogart's better acting jobs, and J. Carrol Naish, Lloyd Bridges, Rex Ingram, Dan Duryea, and the others are equally good. While this may be a propaganda film, it is no "our hero wipes out an enemy division without a scratch" potboiler. On the contrary, the decision made by Sgt. Joe Gunn (Bogart) to stay and fight a German regiment rather than heading for British lines is a desperate gamble little better than a suicide mission. This brings up my second point; the ethical question.St. Gunn gets the idea to stay at the oasis they have reached in order to fight and delay a German regiment in hopes that such a sacrifice may help the Allied cause. He must convince the others, and one or two do not go along without some persuading. "I don't mind fighting and dying," one says, "but this is pointless." Well, that's the issue. How easy it is to find reasons NOT to stay behind and fight! Makes me appreciate the plight of our soldiers on Bataan and Wake Island, who had no choice. But this little band does stay and fight, and the story hangs on their decision.My third point is a bit arcane, and has to do with Hollywood business practices of the 1940s. Bogart was, when this movie started production, about the biggest star in Hollywood. Remember, he had already made High Sierra," "The Maltese Falcon," and "Casablanca." Why then, did Warner Brothers lend him out to Columbia to do this picture? Columbia was still barely a second rank studio. What did they have to trade in return? Rita Hayworth? I don't think she made any films for Warners, but I may be wrong.Lastly, it's interesting to note that Bogart, when he started his own company (Santana Productions) in the late 40s, signed a releasing deal with Columbia. I guess he must have been impressed with Columbia while making this picture, as well as "Dead Reckoning" (1947).I strongly recommend "Sahara" to anyone who has not seen it. It's exciting action combined with interesting characterizations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pedantic But Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Zoltan Korda-John Howard Lawson World War II curio is at times a superb war film, with fine pace, excellent location photography and some excellent, unflashy acting. It is a story in the tradition of The Lost Patrol, as experienced U.S. Sgt. Humphrey Bogart, in a tank, helps a motley crew of soldiers, mostly British, in search of either their unit, safety or water, whichever comes first. They wind up at a desert fort and are eventually attacked by a German regiment that is also desperate and thirsty, and some exciting action scenes of fighting and exhausted men are the result.Bogart is his usual charismatic self in the lead, and the supporting cast is nearly as good, especially Bruce Bennett and J. Carrol Naish; the former is quiet and dignified, as was his custom, the latter typically flamboyant, but this time his florid acting is appropriate. Overall I like this movie a lot. Like all the best war films, it focuses on seemingly small things, such as well that has gone dry (or has it?), the glaring sun, the little stories of home life,--for once not corny. There is a black African solider who is treated as an equal, and well-acted by Rex Ingram. Now and again, though, the movie turns preachy, as a certain internationalist tendentiousness creeps in, which, even if one finds its agreeable, detracts somewhat from the exciting story and makes it at times feel like a tract on the need for cooperation among nations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rousing WWII Patriotic War Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sahara although not usually contained in the compendium of Bogey's best movies is a rousing WWII action movie. The plot involving a rag tag group of allied soldiers,along with Bogey's M-3 Grant Tank "Lulu Belle" holding a North African well against a motorized battalion of the Afrika Korps is enough to set the tone of this movie. I will not go into the plot any further but state that it was filmed in 1943 and it was a morale booster. The acting is first rate and the fact that an African-American actor, Rex Ingram was treated as an equal, as Sergeant-Major Tambul, Fourth Sudanese Battalion was far ahead of his time. A movie I see every time it plays. It was remade for TV with James Belushi playing the Bogart role as Master Sergeant Joe Gunn, USA and was a good movie in its own right. However, the Bogart version sets the standard. A must see movie for Bogey fans and WWII film buffs.Michael Wolkow, Colonel, Infantry, Retired</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bogart does well as an American tank commander early in WW II coming across some retreating British infantry. They later make a dramatic last stand against the attacking Germans.Two actors make this movie a standout. J. Carroll Naish was of Irish descent, and he never played an Irishman in his long and great career as an actor. Check his movies and look for his great performances. Here he is magnificent as a tormented and disillusioned Italian prisoner (a German ally) who has to fianlly decide if he'll fight with the Germans or stand with the Allies, who could have let him die in the desert.Rex Ingram was a fine black actor who here plays a Sudanese soldier in British colonial service. The depiction of a heroic black soldier was rare during World War Two (see my review of "Bataan"). He too was memorable. It's a fine film and worth catching whenever you can find it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, if somewhat flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SAHARA is an excellent war film and a very good portrayal of the kind of friendship and diversity the Allies needed to defeat the Afrika Korps in North Africa. Humphrey Bogart plays Sergeant Joe Gunn, commander of a Grant/Lee Tank, also known as an M-3. The M-3s were superior to every British tank and were on par with the Germans' Mark IV Panzer. A slight flaw is that, outside of this movie, no subsequent film or documentary mentions any Americans being with the British 8th Army at Tobruk. Supposedly, the M-3s were shipped to Malta, the British base in the Mediterranean. By then, the Brits were well-versed in how to run it. Doubtless, any ship sailing straight from America to Egypt would have been blown to pieces by a U-Boat, the Luftwaffe or the Kriegsmarine. Anyway, Bogart and his crewmates Bruce Bennett (aka Herman "Tarzan" Brix) and Dan Duryea are alone in the Libyan desert after the fall of Tobruk. Being 1943 and that this film was a feel-good piece of Allied propaganda, no mention is made of how the British wasted the incredibly gallant stand by the Free French at Bir Hacheim and let the Germans outflank them while they literally drank tea. Bogart and crew head south to regroup, trying to coax as many miles out of Lulubelle, the name of the tank. They come up a diverse band of Allied soldiers from many nationalities -- English, Irish, Australian, South African and French. Together they head for the nearest well as they are desperately in need of water. Along the way, they pick up a Sudanese sergeant major named Tambul (excellently portrayed by Rex Ingram) and his Italian prisoner (the always reliable Irish-born J. Carrol Naish). It was a rare thing to see a black character portrayed as an equal with whites, but Ingram pulled it off seamlessly. Look for his scene in the well with Bennett when he is asked about the Islamic custom of having more than one wife. Anyway, Tambul leads them to a well, but it's dry, so he takes them to a second well where they find only a trickle of water. During the trip they lose Lloyd Bridges in probably the briefest acting portrayal for a man billed fourth on the cast list. A Luftwaffe fighter pilot (Kurt Kreuger) strafes the tank, but is shot down when he is lulled into making one pass too many and flies within gun range of Lulubelle and Sgt. Gunn. Kreuger's role will become extremely important later, especially when he tries to force his reluctant Italian ally to show respect for Hitler and help Kreuger escape. The plot gets even more interesting when Bogart persuades the men to stay at the well instead of taking all the water they can carry and leaving. The purpose was really for propaganda purposes, to show that the diverse allied soldiers could work well together and be willing to sacrifice their lives for each other against a common enemy -- a somewhat stereotypical, but well-played enemy led by veteran actor John Wengraf. Other reviewers have noted that the battle was needless since the tank crew and allies could have taken the water and left the well, driving to the nearest British position. First of all, that would have defeated the propaganda appeal of the film. Secondly, the tank only had 150 miles, at best, of fuel. Sixty miles' worth was used to the first well, then another 50 to the second well. The tank could very well have been stuck in the desert, out of gas, waiting for the Luftwaffe to swoop down with a bomb. They don't mention it in the film, but for us viewers, hindsight is always 20/20. Besides, all the fine acting of the first-rate cast would have gone unnoticed, including Louis Mercier as Frenchie LeBeau. His scene of how life in his village was as simple as cutting slices of cheese and washing them down with fine wine before the Nazis came in and killed everybody is excellent.  I don't think it's a spoiler alert to say that most of the actors don't make it to the end. Each dies a heroic death, including Tambul who takes care of a certain Luftwaffe pilot who throws racial slurs around way too easily while showing his Italian "ally" how ruthless a Nazi can be. The battle scenes are good, except way too many German soldiers stay on their feet even when explosions go off right next to them. Kreuger's role is good as he and Bogart square off in a classic battle of psychological warfare. Whose will will break first -- courageous allies fighting evil or disciplined, cold-blooded men desperate for water? In another nod to a WWII ally, the film was adapted from a Soviet play that originally had 13 Soviet nationalities coming together to fight the Nazis at Moscow. As I said before, the film was made in 1943 and was a "feel-good" film made for the American public and our allies. Bogart holds up his end well, although he gets a bit too preachy at times. Bruce Bennett is a little too stiff and bland, but then again, he wasn't the most fluid Tarzan either. The main flaw is that the German fighter plane was a painted-over American fighter. A lot of people in the 1943 viewings picked that out right away. But, it can be overlooked because the Luftwaffe wasn't giving up its planes without a fight. All in all, a first-rate film. A lot of people overlook this gem when putting together a library of Bogart films. It easily holds up with "The Maltese Falcon," "The African Queen" and "Casablanca."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Hollywood Used To Know How Good Movies Were Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing to know about this enduring minor classic is that it was never included in the Harvard University based eggheaded revival of Bogart films. The super-brains there only recognized Warner-Bogart movies, never those made by Columbia; even though several of Bogart's best were Columbia Pictures and African Queen and Barefoot Contessa were United Artists.Columbia took a B-movie sized budget, a great story, excellent acting and made a classic which had a shelf-life in theaters and TV in excess of 40 years. The story was good enough to be remade as a western in 1953 called Last of the Comanchees. Two years ago, Hollywood used the same title (Sahara) to produce a huge budget color adventure movie (but with an altogether story). With unlimited resources and today's alleged high tech, Hollywood produced a mildly entertaining picture which had a shelf-life, not of 40 years, but way under 40 weeks.The Bogart SAHARA isn't easy to find these days, but have a look on eBay or request it from Turner Classics. Timeless, it won't disappoint even after 63 years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess this is what you'd call a "man's movie," a tough war story with no female characters in the cast. Humphrey Bogart is an effective tough-guy American sergeant leading an international group of Allies in a tank across the Sahara desert.Eventually they battle huge odds against an onrushing German forces. intent on getting water from a well that was being tapped by Bogart's crew. There are a few lulls when characterizations are made, and the anti-German fervor in here is a little overdone. However, since it made right in the middle of World War II, that's understandable.There is some good photography in here with nice shadows form the sand dunes. Overall, a pretty solid war film that has decent action without overdoing it. Complementing Bogart in he cast are the likes of Bruce Bennett. Lloyd Bridges, Dan Duryea and J.

First saw this movie about 1950 and have always enjoyed the acting. Not "hoaky" like some of the other movies of that period. Well worth watching. All of the characters have some depth. Too bad they had to use a P-51C as a German Fighter aircraft. That was the only point that could have used some work, but in 1943 it was hard to "get" a BF-109 unless you were in a P-51.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's really nothing great about this movie but I find it enjoyable in so many ways. First of all, how often do you get a chance to see a tank of that vintage. Bogart plays a tough sergeant but being Bogart, there's a human softer side to him. One of the best scenes is watching the German troops moving forward, the survivors at the oasis are sure they are going to be overwhelmed, but the Germans are surrendering, all because they are out of water. "Wasser, Wasser," you can hear them saying as they stumble forward. Good little ending. I enjoy it just for fun. A number of good supporting actors round it out. And like all war movies made during WW II, it's got every kind of character from the tough guy to the disillusioned Italian, to the French African hero, to the sneaky craft Nazi. And did I mention the proper Brit? See it for fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many American words are considered oxymoron. The word Sahara for instance is the Arab word for Water. It is in this vast, arid empty nowhere our movie takes place. The film is called " Sahara " and stars one of the finest thespians ever to grace Hollywood. Although, Humphrey Bogart plays Sgt. Joe Gunn, for the benefit of the U.S. Army and it's war time propaganda machine, it nevertheless became part of his highly acclaimed film achievements. Set in North Africa, a U.S. Armored tank crew learns they have been ordered to fall back and regroup with Allied forces. Along the way, they are joined by a British Captain (Richard Nugent) and his men, find and befriend Giusepp, an Italian POW (J. Naish), a Frenchman (Louis Mercier) and a Sudanese soldier (Rex Ingram). The American crew, Bruce Bennett and Dan Duryea, believe they know Gunn well, so they're surprised when he discovers there is no water at a distant Oasis, but further learns a German Armored battalion is also advancing on the Oasis and decides to make a stand. Despite huge odds against survival, the handful of Allied soldiers and their single M3-Tank defend against the enormous wave of tired but thirsty enemy. What the Germans are unaware of, is Gunn and his men although holding the Oasis, are also in great need of water. Who will prevail as Gunn sends for help and the Germans prepare an all out assault against the outnumbered group? It is the desperate drama, the fine script and the pool of characters which makes for an excellent movie and one which earns this film it's status of Classic. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart excelled in crime, gangster and noir films, but he acquits himself reasonably well in the World War II adventure film "Sahara". He portrays an American tank commander waylaid in the Libyan Desert with two comrades, radio man Jimmy Doyle (Dan Duryea) and machine gunner Waco Hoyt (Bruce Bennett). With their trusty armored tank Lulubelle (Lulubelle) the opening scene has them following general orders to retreat in the face of a German advance that has them blocked on three sides. Running into the remnants of a British 8th Army unit, the sides hook up to form an international group of ragtag soldiers whose fortunes shift more than the desert sands around them.Besides the inherent story of good versus evil, and freedom versus Nazi propaganda, the film also serves as an effective psychological drama in it's one on one vignettes focusing on members of the group. Particularly effective is the cat and mouse game played out by Bogey's Sgt. Gunn character and his German counterpart Major Von Falken (John Wengraf). At this point in the picture, Gunn and company had virtually nothing to lose in a desperate gamble to hold off the enemy until support could arrive. Or would it? In a brilliant scene, two Allied soldiers pretend to lavish themselves with bathing water, when it's just about all they have to share among ten men.But take your pick. For a film that comes in at just over an hour and a half, it deftly details the backgrounds of it's principals and provides an insight into their motivations and humanity. Each of the Allies in turn prove to be heroes in their own way while maintaining a soldier's discipline. Even Italian prisoner Giuseppe (J. Carroll Naish) has a chance to shine in his eloquent argument against the downed German flier (Kurt Kreuger), preferring imprisonment rather than fighting against an enemy he doesn't hate. Powerful! The film effectively places the viewer in that most uncomfortable of elements, a vast barren desert where you can feel the searing heat with every awkward step in the sand. Needed light moments are provided by the side bets Waco and Jimmy have on the outcomes of their sergeant's decisions. When Gunn hands over Waco's winnings at the end of the movie, you wish that everyone could have come out a winner and a survivor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May be the best desert war film of all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sahara" stands out as an excellent movie in all areas ? acting, cinematography, directing, musical score, plot and scripting, technical fields, et al. It's one of the top, if not the best, of the desert war films made about World War II.Humphrey Bogart gives a performance equal to his best in other great films. J. Carrol Naish shows again, why he was such a highly regarded actor for his ability to play a widely diverse cast of characters. The other actors all give stellar performances, with nice early career parts for Dan Duryea and Lloyd Bridges. Others have discussed the great script and directing with attention to the personal details of the various characters. The diversity of nationalities and race, along with the acting, lends great humanity to the film. Some modern viewers still take exception to portrayal of so many German soldiers as cruel or as fanatical Nazis. But, some military veterans have commented about realism of the film as well. I think this film did a good job, even with it being in the middle of WW II, in showing common German soldiers as well as a couple of fanatical Nazi officers. Remember, the Nazis were a political party. Not all of the established military officers were members, but some surely were. And, for younger people today who may think of this as too overtly propagandistic or overboard, I highly recommend seeing the documentary film, "The Unknown Soldier"(2006). Produced in Germany, from an in-depth exploration and exposé of German soldiers in WWII, the film shows how deeply the "super-race" fanaticism penetrated even within the regular military ranks. That exposé was the result of many grandchildren of WWII German soldiers finding and asking questions about photos showing their grandfathers with hanged Jews, murdered women and children, and the likes. So, "Sahara" came out right in the middle of the war and was quite accurate in its scenes discussing the Nazis under Hitler and the Italians under Mussolini. Some reviewers think that the film got a little "preachy" in a couple of places where Bogart's character talks about defeating the Nazis. Anyone who has served in combat units in times of hostilities, if not in actual fighting, can attest to the reality of these scenes as well. There are always some GIs, Marines, sailors or airmen who have a deep sense of patriotism, honor and right over oppression ? and they will express it at times. So, even in that regard, I think this film adds another important touch of realism. This film received three Oscar nominations for 1943, a year that was crowded with nominations from many superb films. Among those were some other all-time top war theme films ? Casablanca, Watch on the Rhine, For Whom the Bell Tolls and In Which We Serve. "Sahara" is indeed a classic World War II film that ranks right up there with the best of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie withstands the test of time and therefore is a classic. All the facets of movie production fall right into place in this outstanding movie about sacrifice and heroism. Instead of being hokey, this movie offers a strong and compelling story about survival and does this with an all-male cast. This movie may be the penultimate war movie; it is at least an excellent example of the genre. Theatrics are set aside as the the story immediately unfolds and follows a straight path leading to a strong dramatic finale. Humphrey Bogart and the rest of the cast are excellent. Especially impressive is the performance of J. Carroll Naish as an Italian POW. Although made during World War Two, the movie succeeds in keeping propaganda to a minimum and concentrates instead on telling a story. The movie maintains a steady level of suspense as the audience is made to wonder whether the tank crew will survive. In the era of flashy special effects and computer graphics, it is refreshing to watch a movie that relies solely on acting and actual sets and locations to tell a story.</fullReview>

Carrol Naish, and they all do an exemplary job. What I like best about this film is the atmosphere - the sun beating down, the dryness, the filth - you're thirsty just watching it.It was films like this that probably kept people in the U.S. going during the war, I imagine. World War II has been highly romanticized, but despite the pretty songs, there wasn't anything romantic about it. Since there are no women in this film, there's nothing romantic about "Sahara" either. Very good work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rouser of a war film, with messages for the home front and a first-class performance from Humphrey Bogart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anyone wants to see how effective a WWII propaganda movie can be, I'd recommend Sahara. It's the story of a small group of Allied soldiers, led by Sergeant Joe Gunn (Humphrey Bogart), lost in the Libyan desert, who are determined to defend a small outpost against a battalion of Germans. The outpost has a well, but the well is almost dry. It produces only drops of water. Joe and his comrades will use the promise of water to delay the Germans, fighting them off in an almost hopeless battle, to give the Allies after the fall of Tobruk a chance to regroup. Sahara hits its marks to get all of us civilians back home a reason to be proud of our fighting men, to be resolute in the fight against the Germans, and to dedicate ourselves to do what we must to win. Let's see. We've got Humphrey Bogart leading us. His Joe Gunn is sympathetic, tough and smart, a natural leader, and at heart Gunn is just an average guy. The men he winds up leading are his tank crew and a collection of men from other countries he encounters in the desert. They come from Brooklyn, of course, and from Texas, from London, South Africa, Dublin, France, the Sudan. We have the black Sudanese portrayed as a resourceful and brave man, not as comedy relief, who not only develops a friendship with the Texan but who twice saves the day for his comrades. We have an Italian prisoner who represents an Italy which is oppressed by the Germans, and a Nazi prisoner who is arrogant and vicious. We have a battle in which ingenuity and bravery manage to hold off brutal frontal attacks. And we have good men dying for a cause which is larger than they are. Sergeant Gunn calls everyone together in the blazing sun just outside the mud-brick outpost to explain what he wants to do against the oncoming battalion of Germans. He intends that they will fight to hold off and delay the enemy. He has fewer than ten men. The Germans have several hundred. "I look at it this way," he tells the group. "Because it is a 100-to-one shot, because it is so much more than line-of-duty, because there's so little chance of us coming out of it, I felt I ought to put it up to you. You've all got families at home, wives, mothers, sweethearts. I ain't got none, so it doesn't matter about me. I know how you feel about 'em...maybe havin' none I know even better. What you decide, you'd better decide quick." One British soldier speaks up, "Well, nobody minds giving his life, but this is throwing it away. Why?" "Why?" Joe answers, "Why did your people go about their business when the Germans were throwing everything in the book at 'em? Why did your little boats take the men off the beach at Dunkirk? Why did the Russians make a stand at Moscow? Why did the Chinese move whole cities thousands of miles inland when the Japs attacked 'em? Why Bataan? Why Corregidor? Maybe they were all nuts but there's one thing they did do. They delayed the enemy and kept on delayin' 'em until we got strong enough to hit 'em harder than they were hittin' us. I ain't no general, but it seems to me that's one way to win." The first third of the movie is Joe, his tank and his crew, trying to find their way back to their lines and slowly gathering up the others. They are attacked by a German fighter and have to keep moving through a scouring sandstorm. The middle of the film is spent watching their struggle to collect the few drops of water coming from the well. More importantly, now we get to know most of the men as individuals. We also get to know just how dangerous the Nazi prisoner is. And the last third is a rouser...the preparation for what appears to be a hopeless battle, the dedication of the men as they fight and die, and then the final victory. There's no false heroics about Joe Gunn. He's just a gritty sergeant who rises to the occasion. With the exception of J. Carrol Naish, who gives one of his over-played little-man Italian performances, the actors all do fine jobs. I particularly liked Dan Duryea, Rex Ingram and Louis Mercier. One other thought. If you're ever in a battle, never show your pals a photo of your sweetheart or your child. You'll soon be dead if you do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man and Tank</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great thing when Sahara opens is Bogart's relationship with his tank. Maybe he's been in the desert too long! But he's fairly explicit in his attitude, and can't talk about his tank without likening it to a girlfriend. He says that that the sound it makes is sweeter than anything any woman can say. Five minutes later he runs into an uppity British officer in the dunes, who disparages his tank - and Bogart gets quite upset. In one of his few displays of aggression in the film Bogart defends his tank's honour. The others fight for their causes ? yes ? but the only bait Bogart will rise to is another man disrespecting his Lady Tank. Meanwhile there is a play of nations going on around Bogart. The Nazi is arrogant and won't be touched by the Sudanese. There is a vengeful little Frenchman and a comic Italian for pathos (his name is even Guiseppe). The British display constant pluck. Now the tank is carrying so many men, that it has become a mother figure, and 45 minutes in it's already "old girl". It's a greatly entertaining film, and it's fun watching Bogart negotiate, strong arm and wisecrack his way to glory. I think Bogart served the Allies just fine by shooting not overly propagandist movies like this. The ghostly German army, struggling forward for thirst, is a great image to finish on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was born with this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first started watching this movie in 1954. I was 9. Everything about it, even from a screen not much more area than a paperback. I have liked this movie. I've probably seen it 100 times. The big effort you must face, is imagine seeing this movie in 1943. Talk about bleak. this is a class A, Profile One, propaganda special. This movie was made in order to increase the war effort at home, in the USA and to increase the enlistments in the service. There are no women in this movie, unless you count the tank, Lulubelle, and the guys are crawlin all over her. But she doesn't complain. This movie is not that long, there's nothing intricate in it. But the speeches made by Joe Gunn, Stegman, and Giuseppe, pretty much sum up what it was going to take to win. Lots of people were gonna die. Also if you look at it from the standpoint of Practical usage of talent and each soldier used to his most outstanding quality. This is not only a recruiting wonder, this is a motivational movie for mid management and for strategic thinkers. If you mind the little things, the big things, get in line. Watch it and be thankful for the Greatest Generation, no foolin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great War Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regardless of whether you like war pictures, there is a lot to like in "Sahara". Normally speaking, war movies are riddled with 2-dimensional characters, are either good guys or bad guys, and get killed or survive. But here, Director Zoltan Korda has fleshed out each player so that we are familiar with their backgrounds and motives. They are not comic-book soldiers because Korda has imbued the film with heart - we have a particular rooting interest for each character.Humphrey Bogart, 2 films removed from "Casablanca", is the anonymous hero, from "No place. The Army", just as in Casablanca. Sgt. Tambul, played by Rex Ingram, is despised by the captured German flier because of his race which he deems to be inferior, but Tambul proves to be the better man. Even the Italian prisoner, (J.Carroll Naish) we find, has a family and does not believe in Fascism - he just wants to go home.There are several gun battles for action fans and the films tense moments are heightened by background music written by Dmitri Tiomkin and directed by Max Steiner. Korda has overlooked nothing to bring us a great war picture, as I stated in my headline. This picture was on TCM recently. I have seen it several times and feel it is several cuts above the average war movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining early WW II production.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This WW II movie got made during WW II and was of course part of the American propaganda machine to boost the morales. Quite a few movies like this got made at the time and strangely enough they were also made often entertaining to watch, by featuring an adventurous story and plenty of action.Even though this movie obviously suffers from some of its overly present propaganda aspects, it above all remains a real good and foremost also entertaining movie to watch.The movie shows to fight and never give up, even when all odds are against you. Propaganda, though the subject also gets handled in even much older history already, so the entire movie and its story don't work out entirely unlikely. The propaganda aspects that do somewhat distract though is that it always shows the allies as extremely good guys, who treat the prisoners right and fully live by the codes of war, while the Axis are lying cheating bad guys who shoot you in the back when they are given a chance.What makes the movie mostly great to watch is its simple story, that restrains the entire movie to the Sahara desert and focuses on a group of Allied soldiers (mostly consisting out of Americans though of course) who get stuck in the desert at a ruin that holds the few drops of water left in the vicinity. They decide to stick around to fight of an entire German battalion who are thirsty for water. It's a great simply story that calls on some basic primitive emotions and instincts of manhood. Guess its a real guys movie, that holds plenty of action in it and always has this adventurous feel over it, due to its light and more more entertaining approach of things.The movie has some good actors in it, though it of course is mostly being the Humphrey Bogart show. He plays the main character and hero of the movie, as an average Joe who is sergeant of a tank unit. It's of course not the greatest performance he ever put down but it was nice to see him in a more action type of role.A great simple, yet spectacular and entertaining WW II production, part of the American war effort to support the troops and to show the people back home the importance and meaning of the boys fighting overseas.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart is great in this tense war drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Humphrey Bogart's best films is this tough, scrappy war adventure of Allied troops banding together in the Lybian desert to outsmart and subdue an overwhelming force of German soldiers. Bogart is the picture's dominating force with snappy one-liners and biting commentary as only he could deliver them as he leads his troops in the search for water and safety from the hot sun. Soldiers from various Allied countries are represented in the movie that mirrors the plot of "The Lost Patrol" and Bogart is supported by a great cast that includes Dan Duryea, Lloyd Bridges, Bruce Bennett, Rex Ingram and J. Carrol Naish, the latter very appealing as an Italian soldier taunted by a German prisoner. Rudolph Mate filmed the picture with crisp lensing and Miklos Rosza's heroic score is a fine accompaniment to a great story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just after the fall of Tobruk, tank commander Sgt. Joe Gunn and his crew slowly make their way thru the desert. As they move on they pick up a number of passengers, some British soldiers, a Sudanese corporal with an Italian prisoner, a Frenchman, a South African and a grounded Nazi Fighter Pilot. As this unlikely mixture of a unit moves on it becomes paramount that they find water, however, there is a fully armed German unit in the area and they also are in desperate need of water.A great cast boasting Humphrey Bogart, Bruce Bennett, J. Carrol Naish, Lloyd Bridges, Rex Ingram and Dan Duryea, are expertly directed by Zoltan Korda while the wonderful cinematography from Rudolph Mate helps to seal the deal for this being a technical pleasure. Yet as good as the technical aspects are, this really has a firm emphasis on story. Written by John Howard Lawson (who would become one of the Hollywood Ten), it's chief triumph is with the humane approach, there's no fancy dan cloaking to smoother the picture, this is the perfect movie for those seeking a change from gun blasting bravado war films.Easy on the eyes and ears, Sahara is a very enjoyable film experience that I recommend to lovers of finely crafted golden oldies. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick wartime propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the wake of the war in Iraq and the subsequent negative media coverage of any US military manoeuvre of any description, it's easy to feel a sneaking sense of resentment when watching a film like Sahara, which basically condenses the various nationalities involved in the war (even the Chinese get a mention at one point) into the story of the defence of a desert well by a ragged band of allies against a unit of German soldiers that vastly out-mans and out-guns them. What grates is that this mini League of Nations ? US, British, French, South African, Sudanese and Italian (sort of ? the Italian soldier wavers a bit because he used to be on their side but now he's on ours) ? is led by an American sergeant (even though he is out-ranked by a British officer) when the Americans hadn't even set foot in the African desert when the El Alamein conflict was taking place.It's interesting really. The intentions of the studios were no doubt good ? they were primarily producing films for the domestic market, after all ? but one wonders how much films like this ? and the dominant position of US films throughout the latter half of the 20th Century ? contributed to the anti-American feeling that seems to pervade so many nations these days.The film itself is highly entertaining. Bogie, at the top of his game, is a commanding presence, even if he doesn't convince as a military man. With a few notable exceptions (The Caine Mutiny, for instance) he was rarely convincing for me outside of crime films, even though he was always interesting to watch. He's pretty good here, though, which is just as well as his is the only big name on the cast list ? although there are a number of accomplished character actors, and a couple of second-string stars in the making (Duryea, Bridges).The pace of the film is terrific, throwing us straight into the action and never letting up as Bogie and his buddy pick up a variety of allies on their drive for water and then defend it against a bunch of stereotypical Nazis who think nothing of killing their own if they squeal or of shooting in the back an enemy under the protection of the white flag. There's even a black guy (Rex Ingram) whose character is given dignity and intelligence in an era when most blacks on film comically rolled their eyes and spoke with the accent of the deep south.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sgt. Joe Gunn (Bogey) &amp; Company Take On The Afrika Corps.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fighting in North Africa was just about all done when this picture was released. That's not to say that it was out dated or anything like that. There was an awful lot of fighting against the same enemies, namely Nazi Germany, Facsist Italy and Imperial Japan.As a type of film, other than the being a War Movie, SAHARA is also classified as a Microcosm Scenario. In some respects, it is very much like the MGM Robert Taylor Vehicle, BATAAN (also 1943). They both present fictionalized stories of events that are tied in with real events of recent times. Now do you get it? In SAHARA, we have the remains of a tank crew (3 men. Bogaey, Dan Dureyea and Bruce Bennett (the former Herman Brix.*). To this, we add a contingent of British Troops, from all corners of the former British Empire, now referred as the British Commonwealth of Nations. We had men from Australia, New Zealand, Canada, as well as England and Scotland. Later they are joined by one Sgt, Tamul (Rex Ingram),a British Soldier from Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.** The Sgt. Tamul has a prisoner, one Giusseppe, an Italian Soldier(J. Carroll Naish).*** The inclusion of the Italian, is source to a most poignant and even propagandistic scenes in all of the World War II films. It involves whether or not to bring the Italian with them or leave him alone in the Sahara. It is at once heart warming, sad, happy and important to the War Effort and the attitude of the American to the status of Italy in the War. For it should be remembered that Mussolini was dethroned by this time in 1943 and the Italians had capitulated, joining with the Allies.Also worth mention,is the capture of the German Luftwaffa Pilot(Kurt Krueger). Not only was he a soldier of The Third Reich, but he was also an enthusiastic supporter of the Nazi beliefs and propaganda. There is an interesting contrast between the German and the Italian.The dessert scenery of "the Sahara " is genuine dessert, but the Mojave, in the Southwest U.S.A., California, no doubt.In addition to all the above mentioned items, a most coherent, action filled and believable a story is to be seen anywhere. The story by one Philip MacDonald, adapted from the Soviet Russian film, "The Thirteen." The screenplay was written by John Howard Lawson and Zoltan Korda, with adaption of James O'Hanlon and Sidney Buchman.And lastly, we could not close without mentioning the musical score. From the opening theme to the closing credits, we found the original film music to be unforgettable, haunting and most appropriate as the underlining reinforcement to the action occurring on the screen.* Former Stanford University Football Player and '28 Olympic Track &amp; Field competitor, Herman Brix became Bruce Bennett after a stint in Saturday Matinée Serials and other offerings as "New Adventures of Tarzan", "Hawk of the Wilderness" and even as a supporting player in Columbia Comedy Shorts with the likes of Andy Clyde and The 3 Stooges. Mr. Brix/Bennett had just passed away earlier in this year of 2007 on February 24th. He was in his 101st year on Planet Earth.** The Name for Sudan in those Colonial Times, up to independence in the '60's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film as a child and it has been one of my favorites ever since. I am really pleased to have it as a DVD now. The characters are all well written and well acted. The direction is of men who chat casually of everyday matters while in the face of death. Korda did well. Rudolph Mate was the Cinematographer - and it is perhaps not a coincidence that he many years later directed The 300 Spartans (1962), a movie about the Spartans at Thermopylae. A very similar event.*********************Spoiler**************************************** One of the reasons for this film's appeal is that it does not feel as dated as other war films of the period. I have been trying to think of a way to express why this is true and I think it has something to do with the way it was shot. Here is an example: Humphrey Bogart thinks he is going to die during a German attack and taunts the Germans to kill him. He is photographed from behind!!! Not a closeup of his growling face as many other directors of the time would have done. This is typical of the "undramatic" way this type of event is portrayed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an excellent and under-appreciate was film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film goes beyond the standard WW2 war film due to excellent writing and acting. Of course, due to the propaganda needs of the time (it was filmed during the war), it included an incredibly diverse and multinational cast of heroes in order to bolster the war effort at home. It seem unlikely that such a diverse group of soldiers would have actually fallen together like they did in the movie, but that can easily be forgiven. Plus, the characterizations of the gungho evil Nazi prisoner and the war weary and decent Italian soldier are designed for to further the war effort at home. But, because it's so well done, you'll excuse these overly stereotypical roles. Especially since everything else works together so well.The plot is simple--following a battle, diverse allied troops happen together to form a small company in search of the rest of their armies AND to find water (since after all, it is in the North African desert). Along the way, they stumble upon the German uber-Nazi and Italian soldiers who they take prisoner.Eventually, they find some water at an ancient deserted fortress and then they wait,.....What happens next, you'll have to see for yourself. The plot has some really nice twists and you'll really grow to care about these men and their plight. This is a Bogart film but he is so ably assisted it's hard to just characterize it has HIS film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sahara (1943) *** (out of 4) Exciting and highly entertaining WW2 drama has Humphrey Bogart playing the leader of a tank crew who are slowly trying to make their way to safety by crossing the Sahara Desert. Soon the group of men begin to struggle as the sand storms and lack of water begin to have a toll on them so they decide to give their lives and battle a large number of German's. This is certainly one of the better WW2 dramas out there and I guess it's what you'd call a "man's movie" since there isn't a single woman in the film. The movie works so well because of the wonderful cast who turn in some great and memorable performances. Bogart leads the way and turns in another winning performance but I'd stop short of calling it amongst his best. He certainly fits that tough guy role better than anyone in history so there's no problem believing anything his character is doing. The supporting cast is where the real greatness is as several members are able to outshine Bogie. J. Carrol Naish gives one of his greatest performances with a spot on Italian accent. It's a real shame so many people just remember Naish from his later day exploitation titles because he was certainly one of the better character actors from this era. Lloyd Bridges, Rex Ingram, Bruce Bennett and Richard Nugent also add great support. Guy Kingsford also should receive special attention as Stegman. I think the best part of the movie is the first sixty-minutes or so where the men are having to deal with the desert as their main enemy. The effects of them dealing with a sand storm was very well done as was a terrific scene where the men get to taste water for the first time in days. I think the later part of the story gets a tad bit far fetched but one should also keep in mind that movies like this were being made to make those watching them feel proud of the troops battling in the real war.</fullReview>

That was my feeling after seeing Sahara. This movie is a very simple, straight forward film throwing a disparate group of soldiers together in a fight for survival in harsh conditions against an overwhelming enemy army. And though they have many conflicts within their group and though they are vastly outnumbered, they emerge plausibly victorious. The plot is so simple and yet so strong, it has been used in many other movies, even a Western (Last of the Cammanches). As usual with Warner Brothers films of the early forties, this one is packed with al the good solid Warner character actors and supporting leads you'd expect.If you are mining for rare movie gems, consider digging this one up.</fullReview>

(Much like "The Flight of the Phoenix" keep a supply of beverages handy) This is the first movie I remember seeing Loyd Bridges in. Loyd left his Scuba gear at home for this one, there's no abundance of water. There isn't a dull moment during the entire presentation. The action keeps you glued to your chair throughout. The acting is very convincing, (that's all I expect from actors, convince me). I would love to see a documentary on how this film was made, I suppose that is too much to hope for.

		<fullReview>Wartime classic film with powerful direction by Zoltan Korda including scenarios set in Lybia desert but filmed in Southern California desert, Palm Springs, and Yuma, Arizona , being based upon an incident in the Soviet film ¨The Thirteen¨ directed by Mikhail Romm and made about six years prior to this movie . "In June, 1942, a small detachment of American tanks with American crews, joined the British Eighth Army in North Africa to get experience in desert warfare under actual battle conditions. History as proved that they learned their lesson well" . While the WWII raged in Europe American/British troops were fighting in a far part of the world , North Africa . Small solitary patrols moved over the vast Libyan desert that seemed on fire with the sun . The molten sky gloated over them . The endless desert wore the blank look of death . Yet these men marched on without a murmur , fighting an unseen German enemy who always struck in the dark . Sergeant Joe Gunn (Humphrey Bogart replaced Brian Donlevy for this Columbia Studios film whilst Donlevy in turn replaced Bogart on the same studio's ¨Once Upon a Time¨ and even originally offered to Gary Cooper, who turned it down) and his tank (called Lulubelle" is a M3 Lee tank) crew (Bruce Bennett, Dan Duryea) pick up five British soldiers , a Frenchman and a Sudanese man (Rex Ingram) with an Italian prisoner (J. Carrol Naish who was nominated for Oscar) crossing the Libyan Desert to rejoin their army after the fall of Tobruk . A brave group of American and British soldiers lost in the desert are shot by the Germans , one by one and some battered fighting men battle it out to the finish . Dead the official commander they are ruled by the sergeant , then arise boiling passions in the burning sands . The bunch works together to vanquish a much larger Nazi army that wishes the same water well that they have . ¨The film is dedicated to the IV Armored Corps of the Army Ground Forces, United States Army, whose cooperation made it possible to tell this story." The motion picture gets brief psychological remarks about diverse characters , and although is completely developed on the wide desert , the tale results to be a little claustrophobic . Produced by Columbia Pictures with a script by the black-listed John Howard Lawson and as executive producer Harry Joe Brown . Philip MCDonald (story's author being based the movie) had been recruited in the British cavalry during WWI (1917) and he ulteriorly wrote an intrigue and suspense tale , adding his war memories and taking an incident based on the Soviet Photoplay "The Thirteen" . The film contains Miklos Rozsa's powerful and emotive musical score . Very good cinematography in white and black by Rudolph Mate was nominated for Academy Award . The Sahara desert in this movie was portrayed by the California desert's Borego Desert which is located in the Imperial Valley, north of the American-Mexican border as well as Brawley, Imperial County, California ; Chatsworth, California and the sand dunes of Yuma, Arizona . Two thousand tons of sand were transported to the filming set in order to create the feel of loose desert sand, the shadows were spray-painted on desert hills to make them be seen more clearly by the audience ; moreover, sand dune ripples were created by spray-painting the sand with light paint and then turning on a wind-machine.Magnificent direction by the British Zoltan Korda and excellent interpretations make this a very good film . This particular story was former and subsequently remade and reworked several times : The first time by John Ford in ¨The lost patrol¨ with Victor McLagen and Boris Karloff ¨ set in Mesopotamia ; ¨Bataan¨ by Tay Garnett with Robert Taylor in Philippines jungle ; ¨Last of Comanches¨ made by the same studio about a decade later , was loosely based on this movie , realized by Andre De Toth with Broderick Crawford in Califonia desert ; and even part of ¨Flight of Phoenix¨ by Robert Aldrich in Sahara desert . The motion picture will appeal to cinema classic moviegoers .</fullReview>

A real gem! Made during the war years, this film is a great patriotic (Not Hokey!) film. The many wonderful lead and character actors in this film are giving us their very best. Goodies and baddies are still worth watching for their grand work here. In many parts of this film, there exists some real rousing emotional moments that causes either a tear or the hair on the back of your neck to stand-up with excitement to the viewer. The writing of this film has the necessary solid 'A', 'B', 'C' plots to stuff even more drama into this great project. I could go on for even more, but I won't. This fine film is a cinema jewel and it's in Black and White! Any small continuity problems with period costumes or fighting vehicles does NOT detract from this film's watch-ability or enjoyment! I couldn't help thinking that due to the middle East military actions, this film should be remade in an updated patriotic "War on Terrorism' version.</fullReview>

Carroll Naish (a deserving Oscar nominee), Rex Ingram, etc.The film - Bogart's first away from Warners since STAND-IN (1937) and named after its one-word desert location a' la the star's recent success, CASABLANCA (1942) - isn't as heavy on propaganda as other contemporary efforts and, at the time, Bogie's portrayal was hailed as the most realistic depiction of an American soldier ever seen on the screen. Director Korda later followed this with the inferior COUNTER-ATTACK (1945), featuring another of Warner Bros.' biggest stars - Paul Muni.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is your basic run of the mill WWII era film in some regards but one that has a nice distinction in it as well. It isn't the normal flag waving, patriotic cinema that was so common during the war (1942-45), not that there is anything wrong that then or now,in that this movie has a dark grittier edge to it. It also gives the viewer that isn't well versed in the desert campaigns a true and accurate depiction of the hardships that faced the combatants-the intense heat by day, cool temps at night, the sand storms, the lack of water, the loneliness of being in a war-front most similar to the face of the moon. The fact that it was made during the war allows the props used to be quite accurate in not identical to what was being used in the real deal over in N Africa ( in fact the Allies were just mopping up in their final victory push in May 1943 when Patton was assigned by Eisnenhower to drive into Tunisia to offset the 8th Army under Montgomery coming from the east). The character development is solid, the acting I find is first rate with Boggy leading the way and a young Lloyd Bridges as well in the mix, and the scenery looks quite the real thing too. It seems to be pretty much right on the mark too with the historical accuracy which is so lacking in many films in the history genre these days ( witness the Untouchables and Braveheart to name a few) It is a classic...well I wouldn't go to that extent, but it is war film certainly worth attention by all film fans of the classic variety especially those interested in military history. And for the rest-seeing Bogart beating off the bad guys ( the Afrika Corps in this instance) in his dirty dingy Grant tank is certainly worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

(Remember, this film was made in 1943 - the middle of WW2 - so was essentially a propaganda movie). Great direction - not a foot wrong.Bogart gives his usual take-charge cool-as-ice performance, and is superb. Right up there with Casablanca in terms of his performance.Spot Lloyd Bridges (I didn't!

		<shortDescription>Excellent war film with a great cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This a wonderful film with a stellar cast headed by Humphrey Bogart. Seldom did a war film reflect so well the combined effort of the countries involved. There seemed to be a greater understanding of the wider struggle, and genuine understanding and mutual respect between the nations. Great to see Dan Duryea in a heroic role, with marvellous support from Rex Ingram, J. Carrol Naish, Bruce Bennett and the lesser known actors such as Carl Harbord and Louis Mercier. The movie has a lot of humanity, reflected especially when they don't let the Italian prisoner onto the overcrowded truck, but then change their mind. It brings to mind Ice Cold in Alex in which the greater enemy for both sides is the desert.. Not seen the remake, but I think I will pass on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sahara</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Bogie's films for Columbia Pictures is a real winner: a WWII film about a trio of Americans, a gaggle of British, a British Sudanese, a "Frenchie", and an Italian and German prisoners of war all riding on top of and inside a lone US tank Bogie's Sgt Gunn across North Africa as the Nazis take Tobruk. Needing to find water, the Sudanese (a wonderful Rex Ingram) knows of wells to the South (which is the only direction not taken by or surrounded by German forces), and Gunn follows his directions, eventually finding Bir Acroma, a temple with a man-made well with just enough water to keep them all from starving. As a regimen of Nazis (and a guide) are on their way, desperate for water, Gunn learns from a couple of soldiers real thirsty that about 500 men are in a mechanized battalion heading their way. Sending the Germans on their way with a fake proposition over trading food for water, Gunn and company (except for the Nazi captive who actually knows English) plan to fight the battalion, using the Bir Acroma as their outpost. Can they keep them at bay, while Gunn's fellow soldier, Waco (Bruce Bennett) drives off for potential ally reinforcements?An exotic setting (director Korda knows how to direct adventure films as evident by the excellent Four Feathers and popular Jungle Book) with the desert looking mighty treacherous and the windy sand storms quite overbearing. Add the tension of encroaching Germans with more men, limited water, and tiring wait for the hopes of help on the horizon, "Sahara" is the perfect kind of war film to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat. The weaponry is as limited as the water, and the film shows Gunn and his small squadron doing all they can to battle the enemy with everything they have.Memorable scenes include a marvelous J Carrol Naish standing up to Kurt Kreuger's nasty Nazi about his people's misfortune and his stand against what Hitler is all about and the soldiers who fall for his madness &amp; Rex's Tambul smothering Kurt's face in the sand. The lengthy standoff at the end at Bir Acroma, with forces from both sides dwindling, has a lot of likable characters (including terrific character actor Dan Duryea as Gunn's other American soldier, Richard Nugent as the British captain, and Louis T Mercier as the lone French soldier who had worked for the French Resistance, having seen those he knew in Occupied France perish at the hands of the Nazis, with Patrick O'Moore as a British soldier and Lloyd Bridges in a bit part as the first casualty on the desert trip) involved in the gunfire and shootout. Rex's scene with Bennett as they talk wives while inside the well is a nicely warm moment where two men from different worlds find common ground...their comraderie is nifty. Duryea and Bennett's betting is a source of amusement as well...particularly when they bet on the decisions Gunn will make. Naish's begging to come with the tank crew and Bogie's deciding to allow him to join them is a real dramatic highpoint. Here is where Naish proves that he's more than some B-movie minor talent. Naish deserves to be re-evaluated by buffs, in my opinion.The sacrifices of war is nothing new in films like Sahara, as men risk it all to represent what they believe in: freedom. Kreuger's Nazi is an appropriate villain and despicable symbol of Hitler, in a plane shooting at Gunn's Loulabelle (name of his tank after his beloved horse!) before they shoot him down. Tambul's Sudan soldier is a key figure in the film, his black skin repulsive to the Nazi, with it only fitting that he kills Kreuger, dying a hero in the process as the Germans fire at him with heavy artillery. Bogart's stalwart, courageous hero, speechifying the danger of their stand against the Germans but why it is important to do so, is a joy to watch for me personally. But the whole cast behind him is first rate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If this prequel to FURY . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . were titled similarly to the more recent movie, it would be called LULUBELLE--not SAHARA. Set about two years earlier than FURY, there's no room for the kind of fun and games with the ladies enjoyed by Brad Pitt's tank crew. Humphrey Bogart's team already has been whittled down to just three (including his own character, Master Sergeant Joe Gunn) when this story begins. Unlike Pitt, "Bogie" doesn't enjoy the luxury of fresh reinforcements, either. No local gals are plying Bogie's men with food and drink; there are NO females, NO food, and--worst of all--almost NO water available to survive the torrid zone desert heat. The one similarity between "Fury's" battle and "Lulubelle's" is that they both involve a lone piece of American armor facing a seemingly overwhelming Nazi horde. The difference is that the cast of SAHARA look like actual soldiers--NOT playboys pretending to be soldiers for two hours. Bogart's self-defined mission in SAHARA is easy to comprehend; Pitt's orders in FURY are murky at best. SAHARA ends with unconditional German surrender (just like what happened in real life). FURY closes with the victorious Nazis marching away whistling, like SNOW WHITE's SEVEN DWARFS. If FURY made you furious, it's time to salute a superior SAHARA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fine war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In June 1942, American Sgt. Joe Gunn (Humphrey Bogart) leads his tank crew in a battle alongside the British 8th Army. They're ordered to retreat with the Germans closing in on three sides. They fix up their M3 Lee tank and head south. Along the way, they pick up some stragglers, fend off the Germans, and even get POWs. The biggest threat however is the lack of water. The German forces are also in dire need for water.This is a fine propaganda war movie made at the height of WWII. Most of the Allie countries are well represented. They even have a colonial Sudanese to show the Nazi's racism. The Italian prisoner gives voice to the hope that the Italians are a reluctant axis power. The German prisoner is the typical evil Nazi. Their tank is contemporary for the actual battle. Of course, they don't have German equipment but the movie doesn't suffer for it. Bogie is a great Hollywood star and he's the perfect lead for this. The battle is a little bit static but they do have lots of action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Must See" of WWII movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, the story is excellent. Not overly fancy or complicated, and it is very well told. Combining 'soldiers' from many sides of both the Allies and the Axis, beyond the main plot point it is a great story to watch.There is action, there is a bit of drama, and there is suspense. And of course, there is Bogart. It can be a little pedestrian at times, the dialog a little hammy, but given that it was released in 1943 it can be forgiven. Character interactions that are the 'must see' items of this movie - 1) The German pilot in regards to the Sudanese soldier, and Bogie's response. 2) The Italian prisoner's dressing down of the German pilot. 3) The French soldiers' description of 'the Nazi.' 4) The Sudanese solders' (yes, again!) conversation with 'Waco' about marriage. 5) The entire crews' visible yet silent reaction to their first decision regarding the Italian prisoner. If I say anymore I'll have to mark this review as having spoilers! It's a cheap DVD, GET IT! If it comes on your TV or you can stream it, WATCH IT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A War Movie That Doesn't Focus On Battles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another of Humphrey Bogart's war movies, this one made for Columbia Pictures instead of his usual work for Warner Brothers. In some respects, it's a war movie with a difference, in that it focuses much more on the men than the fighting. Bogie's character is Sgt. Gunn, an American tank commander separated from his unit in North Africa, trying to get his tank and his men back to Allied lines. Along the way they pick up a few stranded British soldiers, and also take a few prisoners, most notably Italian Giuseppe (a role for which J. Carroll Naish was nominated for a supporting actor Oscar.)The primary issue involved is not so much the battle against the Germans (although that comes in the last half hour or so) but is rather the battle with the desert. The men are running out of water, and are desperately searching for a well. There's a brief hint of some competition, as at first the British soldiers aren't clear that they want to be given orders by an American sergeant, but that gets resolved quickly. Naish did, in fact, do a great job as Giuseppe, portraying very believably the general contempt that many Italian soldiers had for the war. He was contrasted with a stereotypically gung-ho German soldier.The climax comes with a battle against a German battalion that's also desperately searching for water. Hopelessly outnumbered, Gunn decides they should take a stand and delay the Germans as much as possible. The scenes of desert warfare were believably portrayed (and the desert landscape was totally believable.) The result of the "battle" was perhaps not believable enough, unfortunately. It's an interesting movie, less action-packed than many war movies and as a result a bit slow perhaps at the start as it builds toward that last battle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best War Films made during the War. It is has lean action and a thoughtful, even script. It is rousing without being too preachy and imparts empathy in trickles, not gushes. The Movie's intelligence is what sets it apart from other "propaganda" pictures of the time, along with Bogart who is more of a real soldier here than any of John Wayne's blustering blow-hards.The desert setting is "cold" and there are a number of scenes shot so beautiful that it can be, at times, hypnotic. All the character's here are beyond stereotypes and their camaraderie is never hokey or seem forced.The battles are realistic and engrossing with wounds that bleed. The tank is the only female in the Film, "Lulubelle", and she is not only the center of attention but contributes heroically when things get hot. Overall, you won't find better "old school" character studies of the fighting men (aside from the work of Sam Fuller), and there is much tension tightly wound around the need for water and the need, for all of them, to take a stand against fascism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"He Got The Heinie!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the years 1941-'44, Warner Bros. star Humphrey Bogart made no less than six films that dealt with the ongoing Second World War for the studio. First there was "All Through the Night," a tremendously entertaining action/comedy that had Bogie and pals going up against Nazi saboteurs in NYC. Then came "Across the Pacific," with Bogie foiling a Japanese plot to blow up the Panama Canal; the justly beloved "Casablanca," with Bogie aiding a resistance fighter at the cost of his lady love; "Action in the North Atlantic," a cat-and-mouse actioner involving German subs; "Passage to Marseilles," a tale of the Free French on the high seas; and "To Have and Have Not," in which Bogie met Lauren Bacall's "Slim" and helped a French underground leader in Martinique. And then there is the film "Sahara," which Bogie did not make for Warners, but rather when on loan to Columbia. Released in November '43, it was Columbia's highest grosser of that year, pulling in $2.3 million in its first three weeks (big money back then!). As it turns out, the film is one of the best of Bogie's war-years bunch; certainly the toughest, most violent and grittiest. Featuring an all-male cast and some tremendous battle sequences, the film sports a very high body count, and to its credit, there is no way for any viewer to foretell who will survive in the cast and who will not; most, sadly, do not.In the film, Bogart plays an American sergeant named Joe Gunn (you've gotta love that name!), a tank commander attached to the British 8th Army in North Africa, right around the time that Gen. Rommel's Africa Korps captured Tobruk (that would make it June '42). Cut off from his unit, Gunn retreats in his "M3 air-cooled" tank (which he's named Lulubelle) along with fellow Americans Doyle (the great Dan Duryea) and Waco (Bruce Bennett, who would go on to costar with Bogart in two of my personal favorite films, "Dark Passage" and "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"). Before long, they encounter a group comprised of British, French, Irish and South African soldiers (one of whom is played by Lloyd Bridges), and then a British Sudanese soldier (Rex Ingram, who many will remember as the genie from the classic British fantasy "The Thief of Bagdad") with an Italian captive (the great character actor J. Carrol Naish). After shooting down and capturing a German flier, the motley band manages to find a bare minimum of water at the well at Bir Acroma, and runs into big trouble when a German motorized unit of 500 men gathers at that same well. And this leads to a remarkably intense sequence in which Bogart and his eight fellows must defend themselves against some pretty formidable odds, to say the least, in a microcosm of the larger war...."Sahara" was directed by Zoltan Korda, the Hungarian director who had turned the 1939 African-desert war film "The Four Feathers" into such a shining success. His direction of the battle sequences here is simply aces, abetted by some beautiful B&amp;W lensing from renowned cinematographer Rudolph Mate and an exciting score by fellow Hungarian Miklos Rozsa (who had also provided the scores for "The Four Feathers" and "The Thief of Bagdad"). The film's screenplay, by Korda and John Howard Lawson, gives us ample opportunity to get to know each of the men in Bogart's group, and they are an extremely likable bunch of guys. Thus, when they are offed one by one, the viewer feels as if he is losing someone he knows and cares about, and, as mentioned, most of these guys, sadly, do not make it to the end. All the characters in the film get their moment to shine or behave heroically, especially Ingram, and the speech that Naish delivers on the differences between the Italian and the German is a memorable one (he was Oscar nominated for his work here). And as for Bogie, he gets to give a very moving speech himself, regarding why men must fight against insuperable odds; a speech that invokes Dunkirk, Bataan and Corregidor, and one that Victor Laszlo might well have smiled on in approbation. His Sgt. Gunn is a wonderful character, a tough and seasoned soldier with a decent heart, and his ministrations to Lulubelle--which he calls "old girl"--may bring to mind his Charlie Allnut's similar handling of The African Queen. As revealed in Sperber and Lax' Bogart biography, as well as the online journal of (then Second Lt.) Kenneth Koyen, "Sahara" was filmed in the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park (the largest state park in California), 235 feet below sea level on the western shore of the Salton Sea. Despite the midwinter shoot, temps were still in the 90s, and the desert setting proved to be a very convincing substitute for the Libyan Sahara. Bogart managed to keep his cool physically with a steady supply of Thermos-encased martinis, only losing his cool when clashing with director Korda by day and brawling with wife Mayo Methot at night (appropriately enough, the cast and crew were ensconced at the nearby town of, uh, Brawley, where Kurt Kreuger, who played the sneaky German flier, bonded with Bogart over drinks). Despite the heat, the less than desirable accommodations, the fights and Bogart's heavy drinking, the picture turned out to be a formidable accomplishment; not only a hard-hitting, rousing and inspirational war film, but also another great victory for Bogart, riding extremely high post-"Casablanca" and on his way to becoming the highest-paid actor in the world ($460K a year by 1946; again, big money back then!). I hadn't seen "Sahara" in over 35 years until the other night, and was amazed at how many images from the film had stayed with me. Dedicated to the American IV Armored Corps of the Army Ground Forces (many of whom appeared as German soldiers in the film!), it is an experience not easily forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart is tough Army Sgt. Joe Gunner whose British tank crew picks up several other military stragglers in the Libyan desert while fighting a much larger group of German soldiers dying of thirst and anxious to get to the nearest water hole.The battle scenes are gritty and convincing as the men under Bogart's direction try to subdue and outsmart the Germans. His Sgt. Joe Gunner is one of his feistiest performances and he gets good support from an outstanding group of actors including Bruce Bennett, J. Carrol Naish and Dan Duryea.Oddly enough, not made at his home studio Warner Brothers, this one is released by Columbia and directed by Zoltan Korda. The director fills the screen with realistic shots of sand and desert, North African style, with an all male cast. The usual stereotypes among soldiers in WWII films are kept to a minimum and the action scenes are plenty explosive and feel like the real thing.Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One doesn't hear about 'Sahara' nearly as much as some other Humphrey Bogart films, and granted it's not quite in the same league as 'Casablanca' or 'The Maltese Falcon.' But 'Sahara' is a first-rate World War II flick set in the desert of North Africa. Although the film itself is not particularly well-remembered, many of its elements and situations have gone on to be imitated and parodied countless times. We have a multi-national cast of characters (a la Hogan's Heroes, but twenty years earlier) and though the film is occasionally heavy-handed and preachy, it provides an interesting look at the interaction between various 'types' represented: American and British, British and German, German and Italian. Everyone brings something different to the table in terms of local/ethnic background, and many of their stories are entertaining. Even Bogart's two American tank crewmen are from very different parts of the U.S.- one from New York, the other from Texas. In fact, the only character in the film who doesn't wear his hometown like a badge is Bogart's (given the almost absurdly generic name, Joe Gunn); Gunn refuses to say where he's from, giving his point of origin as the U.S. Army. The story in 'Sahara' is of a small American tank and its three-man crew making their way south after a disastrous battle that apparently left the rest of the tanks in their contingent destroyed. Sgt. Gunn commands it and his main concern is keeping the tank running and finding enough water on the way to survive, especially after they pick up a few British soldiers, a Frenchman, a Sudanese soldier, and along the way acquire an Italian and a German prisoner. Finding water is at the crux of the picture. Everyone is low on it, everybody needs it... Gunn's motley crew and the Germans who are not far behind them. It's one of those movies that will make you thirsty just watching it. Gunn and his men eventually make their way to an old abandoned fort where there is a well, almost spent, but still trickling enough water for them to get several containers full before it stops altogether. Once he learns a German company of nearly five-hundred men is approaching, unaware the well has stopped functioning and expecting to find a plentiful water supply, Gunn decides to make a stand at the fort and delay the German advance as long as he and his men can hold out. (Think 'The Alamo.') He dispatches the Texan in a commandeered German squad car to get word to the U.S. Army Base that was Gunn's original destination in hope they can hold out till help arrives. In the ensuing battle, the small allied contingent digs in and inflicts terrible losses on the Germans but are hopelessly outnumbered and find themselves cut down, one by one. Still, they hold out longer than they might have imagined and Gunn continually taunts the German commander in white-flag negotiations that they will trade 'water for guns.' The commander refuses but is killed during the gunfight and finally the bedraggled survivors of the German company, dying of thirst, surrender to Gunn and a British soldier, the only two left of the allied force. What looks like a final confrontation between the two exhausted sides ends with Gunn standing on a wall with his machine gun saying, "We ain't surrendering! You'll have to come and get it!" What's left of the German company, broken in body and spirit, raise their rifles over their heads and give up. Another great scene is a heated discussion between the Italian prisoner (J. Carrol Naish, nominated for an Academy Award here) and the captured German about Hitler and Mussolini, which ends with the German putting a knife into the Italian and killing him. 'Sahara' works on many levels and is a great addition to any Bogart collection, or films about World War II.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sahara can easily be called one of those movies that "they don't make like that anymore". It espouses courage, sacrifice for the greater good and democracy. It is brilliantly written and wonderfully scored. The plot is simple, allied forces are being routed as the Germans in North Africa drive toward Alexandria and the Suez Canal. Sgt. Joe Gunn (Humphrey Bogart), an American tank commander begins a southward retreat along with his crew. While withdrawing they encounter a shot up British aid station and it's occupants who hitch a ride. They include along with the British soldiers, a South African, and a Frenchman. They eventually pick up a British Sudanese with an Italian prisoner (J. Carrol Naish). After abandoning the Italian, Joe decides to take him along. His morality is stronger than his hatred of the enemy. The contrasting characters played by Bogart and Naish are the most interesting. Bogart, the tougher than nails type and Naish a pitiful shadow of a man who later discovers his inner bravery.Badly in need of water, the group is guided toward the only close source by the Sudanese. Unbeknownst to them, a much larger German force is headed for the same oasis. After shooting down a German plane and capturing it's pilot the group reaches their destination, locate the well and begin the task of hoarding the small amount of water there.Soon enough the Germans advance scouts show up, quickly followed by the main force. At this point Joe and his group decide that just maybe it's worth the effort to hold the well and delay the Germans, even if no one ever knows of their sacrifice. A series of skirmishes follows is which both sides suffer heavy losses. During a lull in the fighting one of the best lines in the script is uttered when Joe and the British officer are commenting on the enemy. "Those men out there, have never known the dignity of freedom" states the Captain. That dignity and knowing that freedom is worth fighting and dying for, helps the beleaguered group persevere. The Germans, whose situation is much more dire, begin tossing away their guns in exchange for water and a mass surrender ensues.While en route to allied lines with their prisoners the force runs into a British patrol. They come to realize that their action and sacrifice has played a role in allowing the British to regroup at El Alamein and stop the Germans. It was the turning point of the war. They DON'T make them like this anymore.The score by Miklos Rozsa has just the right effect at the proper moment. It's rousing when required, but heartwarming during those sad and touching moments, such as when the British Sudanese is shot, but manages to give the thumbs up, letting his compatriots know that he successfully intercepted and killed the German POW who had escaped during the fighting. All in all, a truly entertaining epic.</fullReview>

The western used a stagecoach and the WWII version used a tank. The WWII version is a much better movie and probably more believable. The plot is interesting and probably could have happened in real life but still seems a little far-fetched. The acting is good for the most part and the characters are interesting. While I am a Humpherey Bogart fan in many of his movies he tends to play the same character. Dan Duryea and Leo G Carroll were also outstanding in their parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic film with good re-make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film starring Bogart was remade in 1995 starring Jim Belushi. That version is also very good, though very tough to find. I believe it was a Showtime movie. The Bogart version was a favorite of mine as a child and thirty years later remains a favorite. I am actually working on developing a game using 1/32 minis to play out this scenario. With the available figures and tanks that can be bought in stores, pretty much anywhere, I think that I can make it work. With the various characters and nationalities it could be interesting to find all of them but time will tell. The 2005 film called Sahara has nothing at all to do with this film. It is based on a novel by Clive Cussler (Raise the Titanic) and while most people hate it, I like that one too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart for Hayworth? It's true! And Let's Not Forget About John Howard Lawson!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An earlier commentator on this rousing World War II propaganda film wondered why Humphrey Bogart, then the hottest male actor in Hollywood, appeared in this film for Columbia Pictures---when he was then under contract to Warner Brothers. The commentator, perhaps somewhat facetiously, opined whether this may have been a "loanout" of Bogart in return for a reciprocal "loanout" of Columbia's biggest star, Rita Hayworth. However, the commentator was unaware of any film made for Warner Brothers by Hayworth that might have been linked to such a deal.In 1941, Hayworth was "loaned" to Warner Brothers for their fine remake of "One Sunday Afternoon" starring James Cagney and retitled as "The Strawberry Blond." Hayworth was the title character. "Sahara" came out in 1943. While it is often difficult to document such issues, the coincidence of both films being released only two years apart suggests that Bogart's appearance in "Sahara" was indeed a quid-pro-quo "loanout" for Hayworth's being in "The Strawberry Blond." John Howard Lawson, who co-scripted "Sahara" drew his inspiration from a Soviet film made in the 1930s. Lawson was one of the Hollywood Ten of House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) fame. As Ephraim Katz noted in his monumental "The Film Encyclopedia" (1st ed. 1979) "(i)n the 20s and 30s he wrote many plays, often on proletarian Marxist themes." Katz goes on to state that Lawson was responsible for "Blockade" (1938), a politically inspired film about the Spanish Civil War and "Counterattack" (1945), "a salute to the US-USSR fighting alliance.""Sahara" can properly stand on its own merits as a great film made about America's involvement in World War II. However, some of its plot elements (e.g. the brave resourceful British Black Sergeant-Major played so convincingly by Rex Ingram both capturing a pathetic Italian soldier ((J. Carrol Naish)) while making him his prisoner of war and also single handedly saving the entire Allied group ((including Bogart)) by most timely discovering a source of water in the desert) certainly did not represent mainstream Hollywood story lines of the 1940s.This film contains one of Bogart's most characteristic performances. It is a great adventure story about survival, wartime friendship and American heroism. It can and should be enjoyed on all these levels free of concern about Lawson's possible political agenda.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Watchable Today than Many Other War Movies of the Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An American tank, fighting alongside the British in the Western Desert in 1942, is cut off from its unit, and its crew must make their way back across the desert towards the British positions around El Alamein. Along the way they pick up a multi-national collection of Allied soldiers- British, South African, Free French and Sudanese, as well as two Axis prisoners, one Italian, the other a German pilot shot down when he tries to strafe the tank. Their greatest need is for water, and they make their way to a well, where they find only a trickle of water. They are pursued by a much larger German force, also desperate for water. The tank's commander, the appropriately named Sergeant Joe Gunn, decides to make a valiant stand to deny the enemy access to this precious resource.In many ways this is a standard wartime propaganda vehicle. The main theme is the need for the different Allied nationalities to unite and make common cause against the Nazis. The two captured prisoners are sharply distinguished. The German airman, Von Schletow, is a stereotypical Nazi, arrogant, ruthless and treacherous. The Italian, Giuseppe, however, is an anti-Fascist who detests the Germans and gladly makes common cause with his captors. Had the film been made earlier in the war, I doubt if Giuseppe would have been portrayed so sympathetically, but by 1943 most Italians had turned against the war and Allied propagandists were keen to drive a wedge between the two European Axis partners. It is perhaps appropriate that the film opened on 14th October 1943, one day after Marshal Badoglio's government had formally joined the Allies by declaring war on Germany.There are a few things which make "Sahara" stand out from the many undistinguished wartime propaganda films. Humphrey Bogart is good as Gunn, who is in many ways a typical Bogart character similar to those he had played earlier in films like "The Maltese Falcon" or "Casablanca", rough and hard-bitten on the surface but inwardly decent and courageous. The action sequences are surprisingly detailed and realistic by the standards of the early forties. One interesting feature is the role played by the Sudanese soldier Sergeant Tambul. At a time when the American army was still racially segregated and when Hollywood had few major roles for black actors, he is shown as brave and resourceful, one of the few positive, non-stereotyped portrayals of a black character from this era.This film reminded me in some ways of a later British film, "Ice Cold in Alex", which also concerned Allied soldiers making their way to safety across the desert with a German prisoner. In my view, "Ice Cold" is the better film; it was made when the war had been over for more than a decade and there was no longer a need to see the conflict purely in terms of propaganda advantage. The Germans could therefore be viewed in a more objective light; Otto in "Ice Cold" is a human being capable of decency whereas Von Schletow is simply a villain. Nevertheless, we have to bear in mind that in 1943 victory was more important than artistic objectivity and that films like this one had an important part to play in keeping up Allied morale. "Sahara" is more watchable today than many other war movies of the time. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conjointly forces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sahara" (1943) directed by Zoltan Korda is a war movie concerning the fight against Rommel by conjointly forces, where a military adventurer from Allies gives his own skin, impeaching by that things went wrongly and even worst than must be at the time. This one, an individual belonging to a rare specie in extinction, he has a personality here in this forgotten movie whose roots - as he said near the end of this episode about himself - are well dug since he has been fostered many years ago, without any relative to help him apart himself without family known in the past. Because for him the army in itself it was like his best at home, like that now on the desert and fighting against the oppression. These typical lines were said more or less during a short break of wartime among their friends, mates and comrades, so that as though for himself it was always in these occasions independently of hierarchy grade. The subject is still universal nonetheless the apparently modesty of the traditional narration of a war event with much uncleaned hands by the oil of tanks and sunsets, during the working task surviving the battle on the sands. Socially the event went more fast than its reproduction here and respectively exhibition on the screens at the time, without practically any direct effect on the events because the end of the war. Seemingly more a shot against the wall of silence with the forgotten words said in a context that it was not more the same after its remembering on the screen. Nevertheless the sands of desertification where human beings are almost as lost souls during the war, without having enough support in supplies for the transformation of nomads in a more sedentary way of life, are on these landscapes of millinery mystery for this kind of main character : aloof and skeptical about the questions of existence and conscience, by what meaning a human being moves out of his mood, if necessary in a period of bitter thoughts aggressively against existence of others far away of this white land. Berbers, camels, convoys and caravans, with cars on heat with some shadows continues as the saga it was considered an unfinished job since then. Desperation and the Sun on the head of the main character, it was only illusion for speaking a lot of things that never were being made after this resonant figure commit such a sacrifice before his boots on the sands.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Purged in the desert.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An enjoyable war-time flag waver, the film has Humphrey Bogart as the sergeant in charge of a light tank that must trek to safety across miles of African desert, short on food and water, and carrying a motley bunch of crew members and passengers -- American, UK, Italian, French, and German.It establishes our sentiments towards the war, towards our allies, and towards our enemies shortly into the film. We simply cannot leave that raggedy Italian captive behind, begging for mercy for the sake of his bambina. The German pilot who is shot down while attacking the tank however is a different story. Treacherous, fanatical, and thoroughly Nazified. Somebody had better keep an eye on him.And the allies? Well, we'll all get along together in pursuit of this superordinate goal. All are brave, humane, committed, and longing for home, except maybe the Frenchman who was in the resistance and saw the Germans slaughter his family and his village. One of the allies picked up by the tank is actually a sub-Saharan African, a black man. Yes -- they were on our side too! There is a curious conversation between the Muslim Sudanese black guy and a crew member called "Waco" because he's from, well, Waco. There isn't the slightest sign of friction between this black guy and this small-city Texan, only curiosity on Waco's part. Is it true that you people can have as many wives as you want? ("You people.") No, answers the Sudanese, only four. And so on. The conversation ends with Waco's observation that, "Maybe there's a lot we can learn from one another." It's pretty evolved for the period.The crew and passengers are picked off one by one before or during the climactic shoot out at a large well. The horde of attacking Germans is desperate for water too. I won't say who plants the flag over the well, but I would ask, if you were a German officer and your men outnumbered the allied defenders by, say, a margin of ten to one -- would you have all your men attack at once from the same direction? Or would you, in an attempt to weaken defensive fire, divide your men into two or even three groups and have them attack simultaneously from different directions? It's a good, simple movie, full of desert atmosphere. Some of Zoltan Korda's shots -- Bruce Bennett slowly being buried in a wave of slipping said -- are almost poetic. And in its pedagogic qualities, it's almost a training film for the 1943 audience. It could have been called, "Where We Stand." Enjoyable, with colorful characters and plenty of action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Water ! Water ! Everywhere -Sahara ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart in a tale about survivors in a tank fleeing Germans in North Africa in 1942. Along the way, Bogie picks up British, French and an Italian prisoner of war (wonderfully played by J. Carrol Naish-Oscar nominee for best supporting actor.)Naturally, a Nazi is picked up after he kills one of the men.The plot deals with Bogart's plan to fool the advancing Germans into thinking that there is plenty of water around. This supposedly might give allied forces additional time to surround the area.The Nazi stabs Naish after the latter denounces Hitler and Nazism in general. In his dying breath, Naish states that the Nazi has escaped to warn the German forces that there is no water. An African among the allies strangles the German before being fatally shot by the Germans.It appears that Bogart and a British soldier are doomed as everyone else around them is killed except for Bruce Bennett. Survival has apparently become a habit for him as he turns 100 in May. The bullets apparently tore open the ground and water pours forth. Allied soldiers advance to save the day.We have a nice musical score by veteran Miklos Rosza, it sounds a lit bit like the "Ben-Hur" music he'd write 16 years later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surely, some of Humphrey Bogart's best work, if unheralded, his Sgt. Joe Gunn is a two-fisted, tommygun wielding tank commander, making the Nazis lives, literally, a living hell in "Sahara". Bogey and his two man crew pick up British stragglers and some POWs on their Lee tank. Supposedly, the allies came to hate the Lee, also called the Grant, for it's high silhouette and thin armor among other things. Here, however, it is up to the challenge of the Sahara and the Afrika Korps. Desperately short of water, the "Lulubelle"'s motley crew arrive at an "oasis", only to discover that the well ain't all it's cracked up to be. Add five hundred thirsty Germans and you have got a crackerjack, action packed war film actually made during World War II. Early on, the tank is strafed and after a few passes they take out the plane with one well placed shot from their 37mm cannon with a few rounds from the machine gun for good measure. That is about the only far fetched scene in the whole film. Really good last stand kind of stuff and a good misty eye inducing final speech make this one of my favorite WWII films.I watch it on a VHS tape. I kind of like the spots and streaks and stuff. It reminds me of watching this movie on TV when I was a kid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sahara" is how war films should be: with simple, easy-to-understand stereotypes, a black-and-white separation between the good and the bad guys. A "Frenchy" who talks about cheese (and lies about the strength of La Resistance in his homeland); a German prisoner who is taller, more blond, more blue-eyed (well, black-and-white-eyed) and more arrogant than any ally soldier, and an Italian who "just-a wants-a make a love-a and not a war-a". Who needs those supposedly humane, fair accounts that show that "Nazis loved their children, too"? "Sahara" is fun partly because it's straight-forward and to the point, without trying to send some cheesy "why-can't-we-all-get-along" anti-war message. Bogart even plays army sergeants like a mobster. "You gotta treat a tank like a dame, see."I noticed that there are no reviews of this little film by any Germans on this site. Have they no time because they're too busy admiring "Der Untergang"?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>&lt;i&gt;Sahara&lt;/i&gt; does better than WWII movies made during the war. It shows the grittiness of the desert campaign, lets us see the suffering of both armies and has some striking imagery of shifting sand dunes and bodies in the wasteland. Plus the excellent performances alluded to in other comments. That being said, it does have several familiar propaganda elements, the speech about why this small action is important, moments of nastiness with all the German characters, sequences of bonding between the different nationalities. Bogart does well but his character remains the generic ideal American soldier. And don't expect the careful expertise of combat seen in later war movies. But if you don't look at it over-critically, this one's OK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore the Plot Summary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great film by Zoltan Korda. Ignore the plot summary on this. It's not only inaccurate, it's completely and intentionally misguided. Sahara is far from being a so called 'propaganda' piece for the government as the plot summary written by a college student from a famous activist university. For anyone to suggest that Zoltan was a silent mouthpiece for the government, any government, let alone a western one, shows the utter lack of knowledge of him, his far left political leanings, of Humphrey Bogart, who was a left leaning actor himself, and a lack of any knowledge of this film as well, undoubtedly, of many other things. Disregard and dispatch with the plot summary misguidedness as a classic case of a college student indoctrinated by professors.With that aside, enjoy this film for it is a fine adventure war flick. Takes place in Libya at the outset of WWII, when the Americans sent tank regiments into Africa to aid in stopping the German Afrika Corps units in their quest to usurp the British, French colonial presence in throughout the continent. Bogart does a fine job in this one. He's backed by a well picked and entertaining cast headed up by Bruce Bennett who he would later star with in the John Huston classic Treasure of Sierra Madre. This film highlights in a well shot, well scored story what is most important to men in battle. The personal stories that are shared, including the humorous wive's tales by the Sudanese and the Italian and the rancorous wit of the typesetter Londoner make for fine dialog scenes bringing out the differences and the similarities of men from across many lands. The action is well paced and nothing to be ashamed of, especially considering this film was made during the war! It is for that reason that perhaps the misguided college student assumed it was propaganda. Then we must assume that all films not critical of fighting a war are propaganda and all films critical of fighting a war are benevolent and truthful? Hardly a reality any sane person would subscribe to. As the late great, and no fan of government George Carlin said after 9/11, "Pacism is a great idea, but we're not there yet. It doesn't work unless both sides are playing by those rules. They're not. It's time to kick some a$$." And as George Orwell stated in his criticism of fellow socialists, 'Pacism in time of war is treason."Those old enough to remember the threat during WWII, to remember what happened and what was likely to happen if America did nothing, if Great Britain caved in, know full well that most youth today wouldn't exist as they do, and therefore wouldn't have the ability to speak the nonsense they so often, and relentlessly utter. All I can say is, thank goodness for men like those portrayed in this film (based on a Russian story). Men who would die for a funny thing called liberty. Men who would die and no one would know their names. No one then, and especially, judging by commentary seen here, and other places like Tonight Show's Jay Walking, yes, especially now. But there is hope. For with every misguided, indoctrinated utterance of ignorance, with every naive regurgitation of a misplaced socialist professor's ideals transplanted into a young empty skull decrying the efforts of good men in the past, I take solace in knowing that it serves as a reminder that good did triumph over evil, and that liberty and freedom won the day. That we have the freedom to be stupid. To be ignorant. To imagine we know better than those that came before. That is our reward for our efforts. Was it worth it? Who can say? But the men portrayed in this film would answer with a resounding 'yes'. Too bad no one is taught about them in schools anymore to even bother to care.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart after scoring his big success in The Petrified Forest was signed to a long term Warner Brothers contract and only made two outside films while he was under contract for 12 years. The first was Dead End for Sam Goldwyn and the second was Sahara for Columbia. So Bogey was working with at another studio with a group of unfamiliar players. But this is Bogey post Casablanca when he became very big box office indeed. Harry Cohn must have laid out a lot of cash to Jack Warner for his services.Sahara is a fine allegorical film about a patchwork quilt of allied fighters standing up to Nazism. Humphrey Bogart and his tank crew of Bruce Bennett and Dan Duryea come across a group of British Eighth Army regulars commanded by a medical officer. They get the news Tobruk has fallen and they have to make it back to their lines. First things first though, they need to get water. Along the way this motley crew picks up a Sudanese and his Italian prisoner, Rex Ingram and J. Carrol Naish. Then they shoot down a German plane and capture its pilot Peter Van Eyck. Reaching a nearly tapped out oasis ahead of the Germans they make a heroic stand as the Germans are out of water themselves. They play a deadly psychological game with the Germans and most of them don't survive.Sahara is a curious film. It's a good psychological as well as war film that has absolutely no basis in facts. When Tobruk fell there was not one American GI in all of North Africa. At the end of the film, the survivors hear about the First Battle of El Alamen where General Claude Auchinleck and the Eighth Army held the line against Rommel and stopped his drive to the Suez. What Bogey, Bennett, and Duryea were doing there is beyond me. Usually the gambit is to make Americans, Canadians to explain non-British accents. It wasn't used here however. By the time Sahara was in theaters, a combined British-American expeditionary force had already landed in Morocco and that was September, 1943. I guess our gullible audience thought Bogey was already in the thick of it.Anyway that rather glaring historical inaccuracy has always prevented me from thoroughly enjoying Sahara.</fullReview>

He made it after Casablanca and in some ways - it lacks completely the gloss and sub-plot content of the former - it could qualify as a throw-back to Bogie's thirties fodder but it is craftsman like - Zoltan Korda was never anything more than a journeyman and a real-life embodiment of the famous Hollywood gag the son-in-law also rises - and had for the time a viable message albeit sophomoric seen today, namely that in times of strife nations should put aside petty squabbles and unite against a common enemy. Bogie turns in a first class performance albeit having to compete with J. Carroll Nash; Bruce Bennet is low-key which is just as well given his limited talent, Lloyd Bridges barely makes it to the third reel and Dan Duryea is all at sea attempting to do 'nice'. Nevertheless it remains highly watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a deux ex machina trick saves the day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About mid-way into the film, I was shaking my head. At the moment Bogart made the decision to stay behind and fight the Germans, he knew 2 things. First, he knew that the slowly dripping well that gave them sustenance had gone dry. Secondly, courtesy of the African soldier in their group, he knew that the next nearest well was 100 miles away. Why, then, did he decide to stay and fight? It would have been logical to simply move on toward the location of the Allied command. They could have reported to them that the Germans were headed for a specific well and that, once they discovered it dry, would move on to another specific well ... allowing the Allied troops to head to the NEW well and await them. Instead, he chose to stay and defend an empty well (and needlessly lose the lives of a number of men in the process).WARNING -- SPOILER FOLLOWS!!!!!!!!!!!!What saved the film's logic was a deux ex machina trick that occurred only near the film's end. An exploding Nazi shell blew "open" the dry well, letting the trapped water flow again ... and making it seem as though Bogart et al did the right thing by staying behind. But, there was no way for Bogart to know that this would happen. And, if Bogart et al had departed the scene, it wasn't likely that there would have been an exploding Nazi shell to begin with ... and the Nazis would have merely moved on to the next well (with well-equipped Allied forces waiting for them) or died in the process of trying to get there.In short, the brave battle that ensued between a vastly outnumbered force of Americans/Brits and advancing Nazis was a needless battle.</fullReview>

Soon, they also have a treacherous Nazi in captivity, but the question of survival comes up as water grows scarce across the windswept desert. Typical WWII-era product of Hollywood: hard-bitten, hot-headed, but occasionally jovial and crass. Zoltan Korda directed and had a hand in the screenplay, which originated from a portion of a Russian story entitled "The Thirteen". It certainly gets off to a good start, but as the disparate band of soldiers begins to multiply, interest in the characters becomes scattered (they're mostly one-dimensional anyway, with Bogart relying on his cemented salty persona). Excellent cinematography by Rudolph Maté, nice work from Rex Ingram, some fine sequences. ** from ****</fullReview>
