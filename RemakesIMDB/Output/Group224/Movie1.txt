		<shortDescription>Just wasn't that funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be a natural assumption that since Tim Allen is the main character in this movie, and that since this movie IS supposed to be a comedy, that some of Tim Allen's lines would have at least some humorous content to them. About 90% of his lines were flat and were spoken like they were SUPPOSED to be funny, but just weren't. As for the rest of the movie, why is it that since someone is raised in the jungle, they are complete idiots? His son could speak two languages, seemed rather intelligent, and yet, he'd kill someone elses fish and eat them, steal catfood from the cat and eat it, and do other stupid things that someone with common sense wouldn't do. The things he did were more embarrasingly stupid then funny and just didn't create all that many laughs. Now if we want to look at the point of view of the movie being meaningful as far as a father/son relationship...well...ok, a big time, job oriented guy with a hot new girlfriend finds out he has a son (with his devorced wife, who is of course, really cool) and the two don't get along until then end, when they suddenly do. Like we haven't seen that story before. All in all, just not all that well done. I think the idea could have worked but it was just a poor choice of a final script. Rent if you're bored, it'll entertain you, just don't expect anything all that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched this live action Disney flick shortly after it came out in video in 1997. It was around the time of my eleventh birthday, and I was very pleased with the film, enough to watch it more than once. I don't know exactly how many times I watched it, but definitely several times. Years later, after seeing that the IMDb rating for "Jungle 2 Jungle" was low, I finally watched it again, for the first time in I don't know how long, and like I expected, it no longer meant much to me.Michael Cromwell is a commodities broker in New York. It has been years since his wife, Patricia left him, and he now has a new fiancé, but before they can marry, he must go down to the Amazon (where his first wife now lives), to make the divorce official. While there, Michael learns that he has a son, who is part of the primitive tribe that Patricia now lives with! His name is Mimi-Siku, and while Michael is stuck on the island, the boy turns thirteen, the age which he is considered a man in this tribe. Mimi is assigned by the tribe's chief to go to New York and get the fire from the Statue of Liberty, so Michael reluctantly takes his son home with him. Mimi-Siku has always lived very primitively, and has never experienced city life, so while in New York, he is bound to unintentionally cause trouble! Watching "Jungle 2 Jungle" after my adolescent years had come and gone, I didn't find it very funny at all. I smiled a few times (mostly the parts where Richard Kempster, Michael Cromwell's co-worker, played by comedian Martin Short, throws fits) but if I ever actually laughed, it was very slight, and if I saw the gag again, I probably wouldn't laugh at all. For the most part, I kept a straight face, and found most of the movie quite simply boring. There are also some jokes that are a tad embarrassing, such as Michael Cromwell lying awake in his hammock on the island while others around him are constantly farting in their sleep, and quite a few embarrassing quotes that are supposed to be funny.It appears that Tim Allen has starred in a lot of movies that haven't been too well received. "Jungle 2 Jungle" is one of those movies, and right now, I can understand why. Overall, this is a mediocre Disney feature in my opinion, though many consider it lower than that. After enjoying this movie when I was eleven years old, then watching it again after growing up and not thinking much of it, I would say that it's definitely for the younger folk, and for adults, there are definitely comedies of this kind (ones about someone living a primitive lifestyle somewhere in the world and coming to a city for the first time in their lives) that are much more likely to impress you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painting by genre numbers in a pointless and largely enjoyment-free film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Cromwell is a successful New York stockbroker looking forward to his marriage to a successful fashion model. However before he can do this he must finalise the divorce from his wife, who left him about 12 years ago. Unfortunately she lives on a tropical island off the coast of Brazil and he finds himself stuck on the island with her. If that wasn't bad enough he learns that the pale, 12 year old member of her tribe (Mimi-Siku) is actually his son. In order to avoid looking at the morality of her not telling him about this life, the story then requires Mimi-Siku to go to New York for reasons too boring to explain and "laughter" ensues and Michael learns some lessons that we all saw coming from a mile off.It is rare for me not even to have the energy to type a decent plot summary for a film but for this one I make an exception. Part of the problem is the fact that the plot manages to be embarrassingly predictable from start to finish and provides nothing of value along the way. This is only made worse by the lack of laughs and the regular scenes of Mimi-Siku failing to fit in, one of the most embarrassing of which sees him dancing with his father on the street. It is a string of obvious scenarios all run together just as you'd expect and there is nothing of any interest developed along the way. There are plenty of "wild fish out of water in big city" films already kicking around and this offers no reason to add this to the list of the ones you've seen.The cast are equally lost in the midst of all this stuff and resort to mugging and overplaying at every opportunity. Obviously Allen was going to do this anyway since this is what most of his films tend to be like. Martin Short does the same here and at least gets one, maybe two laughs as a result ? which is more than Allen. The clearly well-off and white Huntington is hilariously poor as the boy of the film, he doesn't convince in any part of the film and is a big part of it being embarrassing. The rest of the cast have little to do and even a turn from Stiers adds no value.Overall a roundly poor film that takes the "wild fish out of water in city" genre, ticks as many boxes as it can, writes lots of predictable and weak scenarios and places them all within a story that is so poorly developed that you pretty much know where it is going from the very start. No laughs and no interest ? it might work as noisy nonsense to distract children but it has no value past that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My opinion on Jungle 2 Jungle is not as harsh, the movie was cute. The fact that it was a remake isn't my complaint because it is really hard to find movies that haven't been remade from other foreign or alternative films. I give movies at least one chance. Tim Allen is, as usual, comedic while being a bit on the crazy side, but still funny in all the ways you would want him to be, if you like him. You are also introduced to Leelee Sobieski in her feature film debut (she had been in TV movies, but not really big movies till Jungle 2 Jungle came out). The movie in general is a great family flick, one that everyone can enjoy. I believe that is should be given at least one chance, so go out and rent this fun movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic/Typical Tim Allen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is solid fun. It's typical Tim Allen, which means that if you like him you should enjoy the movie. He employs lots of quick wit, sarcasm, and slapstick self-deprivation. The son does a mostly believable job with the typical fish out of water story. He climbs out on the ledge of a Manhattan skyscraper and also climbs to the top of the statue of liberty to see the "fire up the sky's butt". The supporting cast puts in workman quality acting as well. The real mom (JoBeth Williams) is believable as a post 60's Peace Corp leftover and villain played by David Ogden Stiers (M*A*S*H) is terrific as a scary and quirky Russian mafia boss. It is a down the middle Disney pre-teen movie and fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable family tosh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Allen plays an uptight New York stockbroker who ends up having to look after the teenage son he never knew he had, and who has grown up in the South American jungle.The convoluted set up leads to a straightforward family movie full of simple knockabout humour. The fish out of water antics of the boy are the main substance of the film, but there are additional threads: the gradual father-son bonding, a young love story, a Russian criminal, the realisation that different values may not necessarily be worse, for instance...This is not a sophisticated movie, but it is enjoyable for family viewing. Tim Allen anchors it well, Martin Short, Jobeth Williams and David Ogden Stiers offer sterling support, and it is good to see Sam Huntington and Leelee Sobieski in young roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Family Bonding Film With Some Good Laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Cromwell (Tim Allen) is a wealthy commodity broker in New york City. But after wanting to marry his girlfriend, he must divorce his old wife living in Brazil. After traveling to Brazil he finds out that he has a son who has been raised in an Indian tribe. Deciding to bond with the boy, he brings back Mimi-Siku (Sam Huntington) to New York and that's were the fun begins. Nimi-Siku learns to adapt to the city, finds fun in climbing on the buildings, and living with his father calling him 'Bamboo'. it is a good family bonding film with some fine acting by Tim Allen in his one of his earliest comedy roles. Sam Huntington is very funny and mostly on accident in seeing a fish out of water story. You'll laugh and you'll really enjoy the fun presented in this family bonding story.Jungle 2 Jungle. Starring: Tim Allen, Sam Huntington, Leelee Sobieski, and Martin Short.3 1/2 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie was in the cinnima theatre. I found this film to be surprisingly enjoyable and entertaining. It was funny and stupid sometimes. The best quality this film has is its replay value. You can watch it several times and not get bored with it. Also, this movie really makes New York city look a lot friendlier than it really is (We all know New York is a hell hole). This movie is great to watch on a rainy day when you have nothing to do.

		<shortDescription>A funny, family-friendly film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of the French hit, "Little Indian - Big City", "Jungle 2 Jungle" rises above the slap stick of the French original and the usual shallow Disney live action to become an enjoyable, funny and often heart-warming story, as much to do with father/son relationships as with a fish out of water. Although Tim Allen and Martin Short are their usual good selves here, Sam Huntington is the real star. An amazing young talent, he makes "Mimi-Siku" believable and endearing, someone we relate to and care about. It's Sam's performance that really lifts the film and makes it worthwhile to children and adults alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Allen on top form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Allen made this film at the height of his fame,and this is probably one of his better films.The story itself is pretty simple. Business man learns he has a son raised in the jungle and then has to adapt to the son living with him in the city.Allen plays a similar sort of character to the one he did in 'The Santa Clause' and the film really plays to his strengths. Although he has tried to do more edgy films (Crazy on the outside, which was pretty poor) Allen has always produced his best work with Disney and with John Pasquin as director.The film also features a not well explored relationship between Allen's character and his love interest but far more interesting is the chemistry between Allen and Martin Short. They play of each other so well that it makes you wonder what went so wrong when 9 years later they teamed up for 'The Santa Clause 3'.Overall if you're looking for a good Tim Allen film then look no further.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jungle 2 Jungle (1997): Dir: John Pasquin / Cast: Tim Allen, Martin Short, Jobeth Williams, Lolita Davidovich, Sam Huntington: Remake of Little Indian, Big City referring to different backgrounds such as Tim Allen from the city and his discovery of a son he never knew he had from the jungle. He wanders off to the jungle wondering why his wife hasn't signed divorce paper and ends up taking his son back to the city. This boy can kill flies with a blowgun, kill birds with arrows, and he has a craving for cat. Lame subplot involves Allen and Martin Short selling coffee and the trouble brought on by Russians. Not director John Pasquin's best moment. He previously directed Allen in the much better and certainly more creative The Santa Clause. The film grows tiresome with Allen going along with an idiotic charade. Short wasted as Allen's moron partner. JoBeth Williams plays Allen's ex-wife whose function is pretty much straight forward. Lolita Davidovich plays his current girlfriend who is frightened off by a spider while the kid urinates on her plants. Sam Huntington as Tim Allen's son is the biggest idiot character in the film and it is unfortunate that Huntington is shamed with this embarrassment. The whole theme regarding raising healthy children is bogus within the cheap farce that this film becomes. It is a juvenile comedy at its worst that should be taken out with a blow gun and buried. Score: 1 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two surprising things about "Jungle 2 Jungle". The first is that amazingly, this is not a sequel, but actually a remake of a French film (unlike "Journey 2: the Mysterious Island" or "2 Fast, 2 Furious" which are sequels). The second surprise is that this is nothing more than a lame family comedy. Even if you had lived your entire life in a jungle and had never seen a film before, '"Jungle 2 Jungle" would be recognized as a predictable pile of lizard guts. This family film is not funny, believable or touching and the characters will make you cringe. I heard the original isn't very good and unsurprisingly, neither is this movie.

		<fullReview>During his success in the sitcom Home Improvement, Tim Allen's only good movie appearance was as Buzz Lightyear in Toy Story, not even The Santa Clause made the biggest impact in Britain, so this was his next attempt, from director John Pasquin (The Santa Clause). Basically Michael Cromwell (Allen) is to be married to his new girlfriend, but first he needs to divorce from his separated wife Patricia (JoBeth Williams), living in Venezuela. So he travels there to settle things, but he instead discovers he has a 13-year-old son, raised by the local tribe and named Mimi-Siku (introducing Not Another Teen Movie's Ox, Sam Huntington). Michael inadvertently makes Mimi a promise to go to the Statue of Liberty, and bring back its fire (?), so he takes him back with him to New York. What follows is obviously lots of slapstick gags relating to Mimi's upbringing, so peeing in pots, having a pet tarantula, eating weird foods, etc, all making himself or Michael look strange. It takes a while for Michael to get used to having a son, especially with all the background Mimi has, but he is obviously very sad when he has to go back home, but not before giving him the flame of Liberty (a miniature Liberty, a lighter with the torch as the flame, cute), and he does show up back in Venezuela for a little while. Also starring Martin Short as Richard Kempster, Lolita Davidovich as Charlotte, David Ogden Stiers as Alexei Jovanovic, Valerie Mahaffey as Jan Kempster, Leelee Sobieski as Karen Kempster and Frankie J. Galasso as Andrew Kempster. Allen doesn't do too bad, young Huntington adds most of the quite light but still affective jokes, not a bad family film. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a good, clean movie with a great plot which was played pretty well for 99.9% of the time. The scene where the Russian mafia man came to the house to teach a lesson for being double crossed had a few hokey moments in it, but was still pulled off despite them. My impression is that the primary reviewer is not necessarily a Tim Allen fan, and that's alright. I enjoy Tim Allen movies and consider this one of his best ones-a man learns how to take on his responsibility as a father, even though he could have, ultimately, thrown in the towel and just turned his back and walked away from his son. How refreshing to see someone struggle to do the right thing instead of just looking for the easy way out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone who has never enjoyed a Tim Allen movie, I was not thrilled when my young son said he wanted to watch this. But as a doting Dad I duly obliged.Plot In A Paragraph: A New York broker (Tim Allen) goes to find his wife with whom he has long since separated to ask for a divorce so he can remarry. His treck takes him to the Amazon where she revealed she was pregnant when they separated, and he now has a son. Chaos ensues when father and son try and bond back in New York.My thoughts while watching this were.....WOW Tim Allen is annoying. WOW Tim Allen REALLY over acts. WOW how the hell did this guy carve out an acting career?? WOW what the hell happened to Martin Shorts career that he is doing this?? WOW Martin Short has a really bad dye job. My word those are some bad effects.HEY there is a young Leelee Sobieski!! We don't see enough of JoBeth Williams on screen!! So in summary while it's interesting to see a young Leelee Sobieski, (having probably her first on screen kiss) and she was a talented stand out then. And it's always nice to see JoBeth Williams this really is one to miss, unless you are a fan of any of the stars.</fullReview>

Allen portrayed the father rather well, and the kid who played Mi-Mi, (I don't remember the actor's name), did an excellent job. The casting staff did their job in picking a decent crew to act.If you're looking for a movie that has an intricate plot, don't watch this one. The plot is quite simple and predictable, after all it's a Disney film, but it's still something I would advise one to rent some night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>some charm, but good have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Huntington is excellent in his first role. (He was cut from his first move, 'Boys'.) His wide-eyed innocence brought what charm there is in this movie. His expressions are endearing, and charming. Mimi-Siku wears his loin cloth on the airplane, in downtown New York City, and in offices of his new-found father, undaunted by his exposure. Thankfully they did not portray these activities as embarrassing to Mimi. It is Sam who makes this movie worth watching.His propensity to urinate wherever he chose brought a sense of innocence to the movie, but I would have thought his 'father' would have given him proper instructions earlier.Tim Allen is his usual self: uncaring, distant, self-centered and a huge ego. The only reason young Mimi-Siku seems love his new-found father can only be attributed to the fact that he has probably dreamed of someday meeting his father. Michael, Tim' character, is truly unlikable, especially when compared to the total liability of Mimi. I was disappointed in the end of the movie; it could have been better, but it left the possibility to the viewer, however, overall, this is a charming movie.</fullReview>

I applaud at Tim Allen's performance as Buzz Lightyear in the Toy Story Trilogy, but why should a talented actor like him star in this movie? Well, let's take a quick tour in this movie. Over to your right, you'll see a pigeon shot by Mimi-siku with a blow dart on the top of a building in New York City. Wait, a pigeon shot with a blow dart? Wow, now this movie is stooping to a new low with it's Cannibal Holocaust-like plot line where real, actual animals get killed through the eyes of the camera. How subtle. And then, Mimi-siku climbs into a woman's bedroom and says "Nice Putchi-Butchi". From what he said, I can tell it was something very dirty, like a woman's--- EWWWWW!!! Don't make me say it!

		<shortDescription>another pointless remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rare are the French comic movies that succeed in attracting attention to the USA. When it's the case, the concerned movie can be successful in Uncle Sam's country and sometimes, American film-makers feel like making a remake. It happened with the French movie: "un indien dans la ville". In general, these remakes are as poor as sequels to a movie. But I found this remake a bit better than the original movie: actors are better directed, the screenplay is more worked and the movie is funnier. It doesn't stop it from taking back some (similar) elements to the French movie (here, the Liberty statue took the place of the Eiffel tower and the trapdoor spider is always there to spread panic and fear). It also borrows sequences from several other American movies and as a consequence, "jungle 2 jungle" gives an impression of "déj?-vu". In the end, the movie brings nearly nothing to an already well-worn topic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one great movie! Immediately after registering my vote of 8 on imdb.com, I almost regretted it and wished I had put down 9. Well, 8.5 it is.I saw this movie in the cinema back in '97 and again on tv a few days ago. I thoroughly enjoyed it the first time and four years down the road, it's as enjoyable as ever.The acting is very good, especially from the leads, Tim Allen and his best friend in the movie, Martin Short. Sam Huntington, the jungle boy, is perfectly cast and an actor to look out for. Leelee Sobieski as Sam's teenage love interest is oh so sweet. I certainly cared for the characters a whole lot, and that is a sign of a good movie (well, to me it is).Tim and Martin are both very funny. As a comedian, Tim is way up there with guys like Mel Brooks, Gene Wilder, Eddie Murphy and Don Knotts. I love it when he tries out the blowpipe. And I love the way Martin says, "What's matika?" (For all you ignoramuses out there, a "matika" is a big hairy spider.)I also liked the supporting cast e.g. Lolita Davidovich and Valerie Mahaffey who played Tim's girlfriend and Martin's wife respectively.I just saw Scary Movie 2, The Animal, and Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back. J2J is way better than these clunkers (ok, Jay And Silent Bob wasn't so bad). I'd put it on a par with Jack (starring Robin Williams).Lastly, the gags are really funny. Quite often you can see them coming, but they are funny nonetheless.Good, clean family entertainment. Highly recommended. 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit, I did not expect to like this movie at all. I loathe Martin Short, and I'm not really keen on the whole "put the 'savage' in the city and watch him say 'Oooh...'" thing, but I found this movie to be surprising. It wasn't on the surface anything particularly memorable or exciting, but everything was presented with such a sense of fun that I couldn't help but laugh at even the obvious gags that I would've just ignored in a movie that seemed to take itself more seriously. There was just something about Tim Allen's scene with the comatose cat that had me laughing much louder than I thought I would. I admit, the storyline didn't reveal anything particularly ground-breaking about the nature of fatherhood or Tim Allen's materialism (it invades all aspects of his life, even his choice of girlfriend, but that really had more of a place in the 80's), but Tim Allen is just such an honest, likeable actor that anyone watching couldn't help but feel some level of empathy and concern for his situation. I recommend this movie to anyone wanting some innocent, rather mindless fun, even those of us who don't like Martin Short.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Allen embarrasses himself while his supporting actor, Mimi, shows the audience his wide range of acting skills with go from making a very ugly face to making an even uglier face. Disney completely misses the mark as it wraps up its story of a son looking for acceptance from his father when ultimately the movie comes to its climax when Tim Allen buys his 13 year old son a cigarette lighter. Subplots are commended as they are so ridiculous that they're at least not tired and over used. I would have never thought to throw in a Russian mafia member, but it doesn't make the movie "work" and it certainly doesn't make it any more bearable. Leaving Tim Allen out of it, the most off putting aspect of the movie is the pedophilia-like dress code of the young children coupled with the pre-teen romance.This movie was so bad that Disney didn't even try. This statement is punctuated perfectly with the freeze shot ending. Would not recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Allen stars in this funny film! When I first saw it, I did not expect to like it at all. It turned out to be very cute. Tim Allen plays a character who learns he has a 13 year old son living on a tribal island with his wife, who has been living there for a while. He brings the child, who has obviously never seen real civilization, home. Madness ensues.My only complaints were that the theme wasn't very original, and some parts just were plain not funny. I would recommend this movie for ages 7/8-Adult. Definitely check it out; You never know;)</fullReview>

That little boy had such talent! His sarcasim was classic and he was very funny. The rest of the cast was awesome too, but Frankie really stayed in my mind. After seeing Jungle2Jungle, I immediatley started following his incredible career. I can't wait to see his next film. I hope to see a lot more of him in the future!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Jungle 2 Jungle" - (There could be possible plot outline spoilers in this review. If you don't want to know what the movie's about, don't read on. But for heaven's sake: Why are you reading a review, then?)REVIEW BY JOHN ULMERTim Allen stars as a city slicker from New York City who is at the top of his game. He and his fiancee are to be married soon, and he is becoming rich and famous. Only one problem. He needs a divorce signature from his ex-wife, living out on some forgotten island. But when he takes a trip out to the island in the middle of nowhere to meet his ex-wife, he is promptly informed he has a son. Allen, for some reason left untold, takes his son back to NYC with him - again, for no apparent reason other than a sappy "feel-sorry-for-son moment" - where his son creates turmoil in his upper-class life. Of course, this is a lame excuse for one of those "kid-from-the-outside thrown into urban life" films, and quite frankly, it just doesn't work. Not even Martin Short, playing Allen's co-worker, can save this one. Tim Allen is a talented comedian with a history of both good and bad films. I enjoyed him in "The Santa Clause," "Galaxy Quest," "Toy Story," and "Toy Story 2," but he's had his share of bad films ("Big Trouble" and "For Richer or Poorer" rings a bell), including "Jungle 2 Jungle."One of the bad things about this film is that we've seen it all done before, and all done ten times better. I've seen countless films where innocent outsiders are thrown into the urban life and must learn to adapt to their new world. "Blast from the Past," "The Jerk," "That Other One with Brendan Fraser As a Cave Man," and countless others included. Most of which have been done better. In fact, all of which have done better. Yes, even "The One with Brendan Fraser as a Cave Man"!For example, take a scene where Allen's kid climbs the Empire State Building. A lot of potential there, but it comes off very stupid. Unrealistic, unfunny, stupid, and boring. Allen tries to keep this film on its feet, but unfortunately loses his own while doing so. Martin Short shines every time he's on screen, but not in a good way - more in a way of, "I have to use the bathroom NOW!" way. They both try to use their great comedic talents to save this film, but in the end, it suffers. It suffers very, very much.Oh, and another thing: This film is single-handedly a rip-off of Hervé Palud's film "Little Indian, Big City," in which an Indian child goes with his father to France. He climbs the Eiffel Tower, just like Allen's son climbs the Empire State Building. It even copies the bird-shooting scene. I just thought I'd mention that.Anyway, this film deserves to be in the bottom of a video-discount barrel at Wal-Mart. It's lousy. A true stinker.Avoid at all costs.1.5/5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this film was going to be funny but man was I wrong it was terrible. It starts out with a man named Michael Cromwell and some fellow co workers bidding on what rates should be for their company. Then Michael plans to divorce his wife Patricia so he could marry another woman. Patricia wanted to divorce Michael so that way he'd be happier. When he enters the jungle he discovers he's got a thirteen year old son who's been raised in the jungle. He winds up staying in the camp and he meets some indians that's pretty much all I could sit through. I give this film a 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sincerely apologize to all you who liked the film.Jungle 2 Jungle brings badness to new heights. It is cringe inducing at all times. We continued watching it simply because we could not comprehend how anything could be so bad. Like a train wreck, we watched in horror unable to look away. Was it better back in the 90s? I sure hope so.The saddest part is that I like all those actors normally but that did not help. How this did not get a nod at the razzies I'll never know.We cannot in good conscience recommend this movie. It could cause a loss of respect for Tim Allen and Martin Short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tools of Torture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to commend Disney for making an excellent torturing device for Al Queda prisoners. This can be even more effective then water boarding but much more cruel and painful. Why does the Mimi kid look and sound retarded? Maybe because the actor grew up to look more and more like Rocky Dennis? I was disappointed to see Mimi die from Aids. Sorry for the spoiler. The dangers of unprotected gay sex is a recurring theme but a bit heavy and not really appropriate for children in my opinion. Tim Allen's acceptance of his gay jungle love child is touching at times but rings hollow in my opinion. Martin Short's character is a little creepy as well. He is constantly trying to get the young Mimi alone and lives with several transsexuals and sexual deviants. Perhaps Disney was trying to make this movie interesting to adults as well? I think they missed the mark here as well. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worse movies of 1997.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking at some reviews and was wondering what were people thinking, and then an idea came to me. People who know that this movie is a piece of junk feel it isn't worth writing a review about it. I'm here to do justice and to speak for them. This movie is bad for many reasons. The most obvious is that it's not funny at all. All the humor sets on trying to make it funny that this kid doesn't know how to behave, but it's turns very dullish. In one scene where the boy eats exotic expensive fish just hits the lowest of all lows. This movie is simply not funny. The premasis is terrible. Does anyone ever think about telling the kid that there is no fire on the Statue of Liberty? Does anyone ever think about teaching this kid some manners? It seems that a lot of the adult characters in this movie are actually dumber than the kid. There is no good chemistry between the kid and his father. At least they could have given us something nice like a scene at a movie. Instead this movie is about coffee more than it's about any father son relationship. Jungle 2 Jungle is not the worst movie I have even seen but it would make one of the 10 worst for sure. I try to stay away from bad movies but failed in this instance. I don't put everything into critics but when all of them say a movie sucks it does suck. I'm giving it a 2 out of a 10 and that's generous. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney came out with this good live action film in 1997. It is called "Jungle 2 Jungle," and this is an updated, American version of a similar French film called "Little Indian, Big City," which was also released here in the states around the time this movie was released.It stars Tim Allen, the man of "Home Improvement," and he worked in the international trade business in New York City. He was asked to fly on down to the Amazon jungles to meet his "son," who I think is called "Mimi-Siku," which has quite a funny meaning to it. He had brought him back to New York and showed his "son" the concrete jungle, as it is known (hey, the same happened in one scene of "George of the Jungle!" About the name, not being there, I mean.)"Jungle 2 Jungle" is one movie that can't be missed!!!!! I've seen this on Disney Channel (old and new) for years now!!!!!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faded hit vehicle for TV's Tim Allen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to give credit to the Disney regime circa 1997 for their bravado: they took a critically-lambasted French farce from 1995 called "Little Indian Big City" and remade it with their number one television star in the lead. Although "Jungle 2 Jungle" features the typically high Disney production standards, it is offensive and disastrous. Tim Allen just coasts through playing commodities broker in New York City who tracks down his estranged wife to the Amazon jungle; there, he finds for the first time he has fathered a son. Fish-out-of-water nonsense is well-produced, but loud, irritating and hammy, with screaming actors bellowing at the camera (Martin Short and Bob Dishy are the worst offenders). Kids might enjoy some of the one-liners and sight-gags, but the film has practically nil adult appeal. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jungle 2 Jungle was a family film, not exactly the movie that the Oscars were meant for. I've been noticing how a lot of Tim Allen movies get a lot of heat, I'm wondering if it is just Tim or it is his movies. But I thought that Jungle 2 Jungle was a silly, but fun family film. Yeah, it was incredibly unrealistic, especially dealing with the Russian Mafia, but it was fit for the family to watch.Tim Allen is a trader in New York who is visiting his ex wife in a remote island with natives. But he finds out that they had a son, the mother has raised him in the tribes and Miki, the son, has only experienced no more than his native island. But now that he's become a man to the tribe, he wishes to see the city with his father. But it's going to be a hard task when Miki only knows the rules of the jungle and Tim needing to get his priorities straight.Yeah, it's extremely predictable and from what I understand there is a movie called "An Indian In Paris", it's the same plot, but I think some stories need to be reborn for a new generation. I think people just need to give this movie a chance, it has a few little laughs, especially that cat passing out from the dart! How could you not laugh? 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Jungle" all the way....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hard as it is to believe, this came from a French movie ("Little Indian, Big City") that is supposedly much worse. It must have lost something in the translation, because "Jungle2Jungle" is certainly the most entertaining kid's movie I have seen in some time that wasn't animated.Allen does a pretty good job as a workaholic who discovers an unknown son (Huntington) deep in the Amazon where he is double-checking the details of his divorce from his wife (Williams). It's pretty much a kiddy version of "Crocodile Dundee": the city slicker is out of their element in the jungle; the jungle kid turns city life on its ear. As Allen's best friend, Short does his usual manic job as a hyperventilating dad who dotes on his family and over-reacts at every possible time. But the main story point here (as in most Disney pictures) is the necessity of family and how the parents must try and understand their kids and vice versa. The whole Russian mob storyline could have been dropped; it just gave the cinema world another stereotype to bat around a few years until the next one comes along.As it is, "Jungle2Jungle" is a pretty decent kiddy flick. Makes a great double-bill with "The Santa Clause".Eight stars. Nice putchi-butchi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film, disregard the cynics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leonard Maltin had it right when he described Jungle 2 Jungle as "the perfect family film". It has the right mix of comedy and plot, with great performances all around. Tim Allen is perfect in the leading role, as he was in "The Santa Clause" and "Galaxy Quest". Here he plays a New York City businessman who is very ego-centric and concerned with work. Naturally, his world is rocked when he discovers that he has a 13-year-old-son, who has been raised in the Venezuelan jungle. What sounds like it could play as dumb fish-out-of-water comedy (like the lame "My Favorite Martian" movie) is actually a smart and extremely funny film. I'm not sure what people who rent this film expect, but so many people who were turned off by this must have had preconceived notions before seeing it. It's a very enjoyable film, great music, great New York and South American scenery, great acting, great all around. I'm glad that Disney is finally releasing this on DVD in October, let's just hope that it's in widescreen and has lots of extras. Great fun for the whole family. One of Disney's best live-action films, and the best movie of 1997. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yup, sucks the big one. Because, Tim Allen plays the same kind of character he always plays: a big jerk. Why can't that man ever grow up? Also, it seems like this movie was copied, second by second, from the film "Little Indian, Big City". Why'd they do that? I was very disappointed when I went to go see this movie. Tim Allen was good in The Santa Clause, but he wasn't in this movie. Just like on Home Improvement, when he's not causing trouble, he's putting down people. Just to let everybody know, Tim Allen will be turning 50 next year, and when that happens, will he still act likethis? About the movie. Allen finds he has a son in a tribe.Trouble ensues when Allen get's a hold of his poison darts. It's been five years since I've seen this movie so I can't remember much. All I can tell you is, don't see it. Unless you're an obsessed and diehard fan of Tim Allen or Disney pictures. If you're not, get as far away from this movie as possible! Thank you.--</fullReview>
