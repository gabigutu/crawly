		<shortDescription>Grant and Hepburn Make the Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today, the world around us may be changing by leaps and bounds, but as this film so aptly illustrates, this is nothing new; the world has always been, and always will be, in a constant state of flux, from one generation to the next. In `Holiday,' a delightful romantic comedy directed by George Cukor, a young man of thirty has some decisions to make about his life and love that are going to determine the course of his life. After a whirlwind, ten day romance with Julia Seton (Doris Nolan), a girl he's just met, Johnny Case (Cary Grant) asks her to marry him; and she accepts. But the story really begins when he shows up at her house to meet her widowed father, Edward (Henry Kolker), to ask for Julia's hand in marriage. This is not an early version of `Meet the Parents,' however; Johnny's a regular guy with a good job at an investment firm, and he's in love. All is going well; he's about to meet the family of the woman he loves, and he's made a decision about his life. And when he arrives at Julia's house, he makes some startling discoveries: First, she's filthy rich-- her house is so big he calls it a museum-- and she has a beautiful, spirited sister named Linda (Katharine Hepburn). But soon he'll be married to Julia, and if all goes right with a deal he's been working on for the firm, he'll also be able to follow through on his decision. If the deal at work goes through, it'll put some change in his pockets, which is all he wants; but not because it'll put him on the fast track to getting ahead with the company. He wants to make enough to get married and quit his job, so he can take a `holiday' while he's still young enough to enjoy it-- even if it only turns out to be three months or so-- and have some time to discover just where he fits into a world that's rapidly changing. Now all he has to do is explain it all to Julia. And to her father. And all while trying to deny the fact that he's attracted to Linda. Cukor takes a lighthearted approach to this story, which keeps it upbeat and entertaining, and he laces it with warmth and humor that'll give you some laughs and put a smile on your face. But beyond all that, Cukor shows some real insight into human nature and the ways of the world. And it makes this film timeless. Consider Johnny's comments about how the world is changing, and wanting to find out for himself where he fits in; or the comment by one of Julia's cousins, Seton Cram (Henry Daniell)-- who is already wealthy, apparently, beyond all comprehension-- that there would be a lot of money to be made if only `The right government was in place.' To make this film today, you'd only have to change the dates on the calendar, shoot in color, substitute Norton for Grant, Danes for Hepburn and bring in Nora Ephron to direct.  But what really makes this one special are the performances of Grant and Hepburn. Grant is as charming as ever, but just a bit looser and slightly less debonair than he is in most of his later roles. And it becomes him; he endows Johnny with youthful exuberance, good looks and personality, as well as a carefree yet responsible attitude that makes him someone you can't help but like. And Hepburn fairly sparkles as Linda, a role she was born to play; this young woman filled with a zest for life and an indomitable spirit. She imbues Linda with that same, trademark Hepburn feistiness you'll find in so many of her characters in films like `The Philadelphia Story,' `Adam's Rib' and `The African Queen.' All of whom she plays with a variation that makes each of them unique. And it's that personal spark of life that she's able to transfer to her characters that makes Hepburn so special. Whether she's locking horns with Tracy, pouring Bogart's gin into the river or falling in live with Grant, nobody does it quite like Kate. And Cukor had an affinity for Hepburn that enabled him to bring out the best in her, always. Arguably, her best work was with Cukor. The memorable supporting cast includes Lew Ayres (Ned), Edward Everett Horton (Nick), Binnie Barnes (Laura), Jean Dixon (Susan) and Mitchell Harris (Jennings). A thoroughly enjoyable film, `Holiday' makes a subtle statement about embracing the time you have and grabbing for the brass ring while you're still able; that in the end, life is what you make of it. But Cukor never lets it get too serious, and never lets you forget that the main thing here is to have some fun, beginning with this movie. And by the time it's over, the world seems just a little bit brighter somehow. And that's the magic of the movies. I rate this one 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a wonderful, enchanting film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of my all time Hepburn and Grant favorites. It is truly a classic -- directed by George Cukor and written by Broadway playwright Philip Barry.What really sets the film apart for me, as a comedy, is that the main characters are fully realized and complex. Cary Grant is Johnny, engaged to Hepburn's shallow, but socially acceptable sister. Hepburn's Linda is the black sheep of a vary ambitious, conceited family. It is her very humanity that makes her the "black sheep". She spends half of the movie in love with Johnny, but her respect for her sister and decency thwart her desires. Johnny wants to make his fortune as a young man, retire, and enjoy life. His fiancée attempts to control and manipulate him for her own ends and ambitions.Edward Everett Horton is marvelous as one of Johnny's best friends. It is a warm and deep friendship.As Johnny approaches the business deal that could leave him set for life, and marriage to a controlling woman conflict ensues.I love the scene in the children's playroom -- it is witty and melancholy at the same time. There is a wonderful balance of drama, comedy, and heart in this movie. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Important Lesson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this incredible film for the third time. Unlike what most people comment about this movie, it is more than just "delightful" and "whimsical", or worst yet calling it a screwball comedy. If you call Holiday a screwball comedy, you may as well call It's A Wonderful Life the same thing. There are distinct parallels between these two groundbreaking works. Both deal with strong dreams being crushed. But in the case of Lew Ayres' character it is his "place" in society that stops him from becoming a serious composer. And though he comes from a wealthy family he does not have the freedom that many believe (falsely) to chose what he truly wishes to do. In a tightly-wound capitalistic society as ours, the obligations to continue the legacy of money-making overwhelms the individual's desire to create what many believe is frivolous artistry. What many of us, as well as his father, fail to realize is when this desire is crushed apathy sets in. This brings up the singularly amazing theme of this movie, a theme Philip Barry uses in many of his works, that a society that chases wealth without conscience, that suppresses truly individualistic idealism is a society of superficial, mean-spirited and back-biting people. The party scene in Holiday is a clear-eyed view of our society and how lost we are. Everyone talks down about others under their breath, than hypocritically smiles and fawns over these same people to insure their own place in society. Those who refuse to go along with this status quo are relegated, as Hepburn,Ayres,and the Professor and his wife are, to the childrens' playroom until they "grow-up" and accept things as they are. This films warms an audience with it's superficial whimsy, as "...Wonderful Life" did, yet can drive a cold stare with its slashing and often hurtful glances at how we are all relegated to the playroom of society if we express criticism of the narrow-mindenness and suffocating aspects of capitalism.Holiday should be an important lesson to many of us on not just how important Life is, but shows us how much more important it is to grasp on to what truly makes it worth living.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is such a sweet, funny, heartfelt movie. The first time I saw it, I immediately wanted to see it again. Like so many of Katharine Hepburn's movies, it's about the kind of love you don't often see in movies. Hers is a pure, sweet, and intelligent love, one which we see develop and with which, by the end of the movie, we wholeheartedly agree. Cary Grant is just delightful in his acrobatics and his naivete, and Hepburn has all of her idealism and wisdom, and proves once again that the two aren't mutually exclusive. If you love witty and intelligent romantic comedy, then this is for you. Not as wonderful as The Philadelphia Story, but great nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now THIS is romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now THIS is romance Back in the mid-late 1930's, when Katherine Hepburn, though she had already won an Oscar, was labeled (along with several other actresses) "box office poison", it was Hollywood that suffered. Unfortunately, after the Production Code blasted out full throttle, strong roles for women disappeared because women no longer had a strong voice in cinema, so a lot of the heavier-hitters (Hepburn, Joan Crawford, Miriam Hopkins) ended up foundering in what they were given. In the case of George Cukor's 1938 film "Holiday", she had a couple of friends involved with the picture who insisted that she be used (she had been the understudy of her film counterpart on the stage) which turned out to be an excellent plan since she is one of the many great things about this film.Set in New York, "Holiday" stars Carey Grant as Johnny Case, a fledgling businessman who is more concerned about making a career out of something he wants to do, and not what he should do in order to make a lot of money. He has a plan; he has been working hard at a job that he doesn't particularly like to save enough money to take an indeterminate time off to figure out what he wants to do with himself. While he takes a holiday, he meets Julia Seton (Nolan), the two fall in love and go back to New York to tell Julia's father. What Johnny doesn't know is that Julia comes from an extremely wealthy family, and while he is shocked and bemused by this fact, he finds himself taken with the other members of Julia's family; Linda Seton (Hepburn), Julia's free-thinking and dramatic sister, and brother Ned Seton (Ayres) a kind but dour alcoholic. Both siblings are discontented with being under their father's thumb (while he is not a bad person, Edward Seton has strong feelings about how things should be handled) and both take an instant liking to Johnny, particularly Linda who finds herself falling in love with him. As plans for the marriage begin to solidify, it becomes clear that Johnny is being forced to quash his dreams, not only to gain the approval of their father, but because Julia thinks it is the way to go as well.Having never even heard of this film, I wasn't sure what to expect out of "Holiday"; I figured it might either be a screwball comedy (based on the Hepburn/Grant collaboration in "Bringing up Baby") or maybe a regular romantic comedy. What I got was actually a romantic dramedy that was not only charming but heartfelt as well. George Cukor's direction (as usual) is wonderful and the chemistry between Hepburn and Grant is simply electric. Hepburn, clearly the star of this production, acts each scene with an emotion and charm that is almost unheard of in the mainstream cinema of the present. While I watched the film, I found myself becoming so endeared to her character that I probably would have been completely devastated if she didn't get some sort of happiness in the end, probably one of the highest compliments that I can give to an actor's performance since I mainly pay attention to the story and the film itself primarily and the characters are important, but seem to be secondary. Grant, who is probably most famous for being debonair and dashing, often played the goofball in his films of the 30's and early 40's, and this was another one of those roles for him. He is such a fresh and passionate character however, (he often finds himself doing various acrobatic stunts with glee) that he quickly proves himself to be more than just the handsome doofus who makes bug eyes at the camera when he's confused. He and Hepburn actually look like they're having a good time together in this film; a wonderful thing to see when it seems that 90% of collaborations look like they are phoned in nowadays. If Doris Nolan isn't unremarkable and bland all the time, she did a really great job in her role as fiancée Julia ? at some point you're really wondering what Johnny ever really saw in her and made him declare his bachelorhood over with at the age of 30. Lew Ayres, a name I had heard before, but didn't recognize by face was also very charming as the alcoholic brother. I found his character to be incredibly endearing, especially as the film progressed. A mention also has to be made of the actors who played Johnny's best friends, the Potters. (Edward Everett Horton &amp; Jean Dixon) Anyone would be hard pressed to dislike these two intellectuals with senses of humor that are more arid than the Mojave. Every scene they were in became even more enjoyable.What stuck with me is that between the script and the actors, I felt like I was actually watching a real slice of life, kind of like Booth Tarkington without the depression. "Holiday" is a fantastic hidden gem in the classic film catalogue and I would recommend it very highly. Not only is it short in length, but also its engaging story, steady pacing and brilliant actors made me wish it were longer. Watch this wonderful movie if you have any ounce of appreciation for classic film. 8/10 --Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A playful look at wealth and its obligations....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wit, insight, deft characterization, family misery, and social commentary all play a part in Holiday. The acting and script are superb -- all the characters are sympathetically drawn and interact in the foreground, while wealth and its "privileges" form the background.Is love a social obligation? Or does it spring from sheer affinity? Should the acquisition of wealth be the summum bonum of experience -- or happen accidently, as the result of hard and honest work? These are the questions that will tease you, as you enjoy the gleaming intelligence of Katherine Hepburn and the polished insouciance of Cary Grant. Both are in top form!!!What stands out in my recollection of this film is the theme of play. The stars are playful; they get acquainted among the toys in a playroom. The plot revolves around a holiday -- a chance for adults to play. There are plays on words. The Play is the Thing. Holiday is ultimately about the importance of play, in all its connotations: flexibility, acting out, silly behavior, continuous learning, freedom to be.It is okay for adults to play sometimes, or do adults need "permission" to play? </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Right for Phillip Barry Roles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Katharine Hepburn brought three Phillip Barry characters to life on the screen in Without Love, The Philadelphia Story and first and foremost Holiday. Her upper class upbringing in Connecticut made her the perfect actress for his plays about the fabulously wealthy which Depression Era USA just ate up.Holiday of necessity had to be updated. It debuted on Broadway in the boom year of 1928 so some lines to acknowledge the Great Depression had to be included. When Henry Daniell says his obscene market profits would be better with the right kind of government, he's taking dead aim at the New Deal, in particularly the newly formed Security Exchange Commission.One guy who wants out of the money making rat race is Cary Grant as Johnny Case. He's a poor kid who's worked his way up, probably the same as the founder of the Seton fortune did back in the day. But he's decided there's more to life than just making money. Like Grandpa Vanderhof in You Can't Take It With You or Charles Foster Kane who admittedly inherited his. Henry Kolker as Edward Seton and George Coulouris as Thatcher think exactly alike.Case has a vision of his life and wants to share it with his fiancé Doris Nolan. But he's picked the wrong sister, it's younger sister Katharine Hepburn of the Seton girls who's his soul mate. As one who's now retired and admittedly not living in the style of the Setons I can empathize with Cary Grant. As long as you have enough to live on and you have interests to occupy yourself and you don't have a family to support, why work? In fact make room for the next generation who might have a family to support.In that sense Holiday has a message that applies more for today than it did in 1938. Make what you can, take care of those who depend on you, but get out and enjoy life. And enjoy Holiday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Grant's and Hepburn's greatest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can you say when the young, dashing, up and coming lawyer,the extraordinarily handsome and highly unconventional Cary Grant, falls in love with one of the richest women in New York, thinking she's a private secretary and he should use the mansion's service entrance? Well, when her sister is Catherine Hepburn you can say there's bound to be a more interesting ending than he-obligingly-goes-to-work-at-daddy's-bank and counts-money-happily-ever-after. The stars are at their peak with great chemistry, and Lew Ayres and Edward Everett Horton give extremely fine supporting performances. This film has always been one of my anthems, and Johnny Case something of an alter ego; showed it last night to my 28-year old daughter, who loved Johnny Case and now has a better impression of her old man. A real treat of a movie, on a par with Grant's and Hepburn's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Likeable urbane comedy about an ill-fated courtship and the romance that springs up in the shadows behind it. Grant and Hepburn are fresh and fun to watch; Grant impresses with what feels like ad-libbed quips and shows off his vaudeville background by doing numerous gymnastic stunts. Hepburn sheds her usual stuffy airs and lets fly as a "black sheep" heiress, the betrothed's sister. Cukor directed it in his best imitation of Howard Hawks, but with his own personal style added -- like the "realistic" feminine relationship between Hepburn and her sister (Nolan) which deteriorates by the film's end into stereotypes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Serious comedy, not slapstick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the fast-paced, silly comedies of this period, but even more I value "serious" comedies such as this one, that present characters with depth and raise meaningful issues, yet nevertheless manage to be funny. This movie and Grant &amp; Hepburn's "Bringing up Baby" provide ideal examples of the serious comedy and the silly nonsense types. It's hard to believe now that when these 2 movies were made Katherine Hepburn was not considered a prime Box Office draw even though she had a dozen or so movies behind her. She and Cary Grant were able to deliver 100% in both types. In this film, the comedy arises from the characters and the issues they face, rather than the "situation comedy" and gags of Bringing up Baby. Now don't get me wrong, I love both movies - and it only depends on the mood I'm in which one I prefer. But "serious" comedy is harder to do successfully, and rarer, so I value it the more. Don't miss a chance to see this movie, it is a special gem. 9/10.</fullReview>

The theme that love and independence are what's really important and that riches are not the be all and end all of life is very inspirational. Grant and Hepburn, and even Grant and Nolan at the beginning, have great chemistry and bring their characters to wonderful life. The supporting cast complements them perfectly. Cukor did a masterful job converting the story from the stage to the screen and coaxing the performances out of his cast. This is simply a wonderful movie, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This collaboration between Kathryn Hepburn and Cary Grant is not seen often enough. The two are as at ease with one another as they are in the better known film "Bringing Up Baby". In this film, rather than a tame leopard, they are teamed with a dipsomaniac brother, soured on his future by a father whose parenting skills are either anemic or entirely lacking.The Potters, Nick and Susan, are the secret treasure in this film. They are so relaxed, and so full of joie d'vivre that even having first seen it as a small boy, I was impressed with just how much fun this college professor and his wife were, that I wanted to be a professor myself, at the ripe old age of 10.There may be a connection, or there may not, but I have been involved in higher education, from being an undergraduate to an employee in an academic library, for 32 years. At any rate, I think it more likely that this picture, and pictures like "Tall Story" and the "Absent-minded Professor" (with Fred McMurray) had more of an influence than "Bedtime for Bonzo".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Holiday is one of the first classic films I had the pleasure to see about 20 years ago when I was a young girl. I caught a Saturday afternoon broadcast on television. All these years later and after numerous viewings it is still my favorite. In the passing time I have enjoyed hundreds of other classic films and I know many are considered "better", but my favorite remains Holiday with its amazing ensemble cast of Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, Lew Ayres, Edward Everett Horton, Jean Dixon, Henry Daniell, Doris Nolan, Henry Kolker, and Binnie Barnes. I have attempted to see most of the films of Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant, but it has also been exciting to spot all of these other actors in other classics such as Lew Ayres starring in All Quiet on the Western Front, Johnny Belinda, The Dark Mirror, and State Fair(1933). Edward Everett Horton performs in Arsenic and Old Lace, Lost Horizon, Here Comes Mr. Jordan, and in several Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers Films. Jean Dixon is great to see in the cast of My Man Godfrey. Henry Daniell pops up in so many of the classic films I see, a favorite is his performance in The Philadelphia Story as Sidney Kidd, Spy Magazine's publisher. I hope you get to enjoy Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, Lew Ayres, Edward Everett Horton, and Jean Dixon entertaining themselves along with the viewers in the "play room."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartwarming Movie (Katherine Was Amazing)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At such an early age of 16, I felt that the movie was going to be boring and i wasn't going to finish it. I was definitely wrong. I watched it and could not put it down. It was amazing. Katherine Hepburn gave me the chills. The Ending was just right. Cary Grant was amazing. And All The other characters were perfect as well. The setting was perfect, but in the movie John Case (Cary) and Julia were written in the script to go to Lake Placid to meet the father. The director or producer decided to drop it and go along with staying in the city. I thought they made a good choice, but it would have been nice if they added deleted scenes of Lake scenes. They did shoot there for a couple of scenes but decided to drop them. (Sorry if im repeating myself)..In Conclusion to my viewing of the movie "Holiday" (1938) &gt;Great Movie &gt;Perfect Setting &gt;Great Art Direction &gt;Great Actors A++++++++++ Movie I recommend that everyone should see this movie at one point of their life. Well worth to buy.Other Movies To See Before You Die LOL &gt;Since You Went Away &gt;It's A Wonderful Life &gt;Penny Serenade +Many More</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pleasant, thoughtful, and witty, "Holiday" is an offbeat and very enjoyable romantic comedy. Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn are excellent in portraying two free-spirited and likable characters, and they are joined by a fine supporting cast, especially Lew Ayres as Hepburn's brother, and Edward Everett Horton and Jean Dixon as an eccentric older couple. The plot is pretty simple, but there's just enough to it to show the different sides of the various characters and to allow each of them the chance to show how he or she approaches life.Probably the best part of the movie is the long New Year's Eve party sequence. It has many entertaining touches, and brings together all of the characters and themes nicely. The atmosphere in the 'play room' is creative, and is very appropriate for the scenes there. The cast members all do a very good job of reacting consistently to their surroundings, with some characters more comfortable in formalized settings and others happier when they are less constrained.Though it has perhaps been overshadowed by some of the more famous films of its era, "Holiday" is an entertaining classic that most fans of vintage romantic comedies should enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Holiday Worth Taking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Holiday" belongs right up there with "The Philadelphia Story" and "Bringing Up Baby" as one of the best movies to team Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant. Watching it today, it's nearly impossible to understand why audiences stayed away from this and "Baby" back in 1938. These movies have instant classics written all over them."Holiday" is much closer to "Philadelphia Story" than "Baby" in its style of comedy. Contrary to the labels people have assigned it, it is NOT a screwball comedy--in fact, it's quite serious and brings a tremendous amount of character depth to its story, much in the way "Story" would two years later. Hepburn of course plays the sister of a shallow girl who's about to be married and who only thinks of living a luxurious lifestyle. Grant waltzes in and finds that he and Hepburn are soul mates. The scenes in which these two, along with an intellectual professor and his wife, lambast the vacuous lives of the stinking and very dull rich, are the movie's highlights."Holiday" is one of those movies that never becomes irrelevant, not to people who still think that intelligence, imagination, creativity and ideas are more valuable commodities than material possessions.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lovely film with a great cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant on paper, I suppose, look like an odd pairing, but they were absolutely marvelous together, and "Holiday," directed by George Cukor, is no exception. Hepburn plays the unhappy, bored, but bright Linda in a dysfunctional, upper crust New York family. Her brother, Ned (Lew Ayres) is a miserable drunk, and her father controls the family with an iron hand and the ethic that money is their god. Their mother, who was like Linda, is deeply missed by her. Linda adores her younger sister, Julia, but has idealized her and doesn't see that she has the same upper class values as their father. When Julia brings home her fiancée, Johnny Case (Grant), it is immediately obvious to the audience (and later to the characters) that Johnny fell for the wrong girl."Holiday" is a film filled with heart, poignancy, and some warm humor provided by Johnny's friends, played by Edward Everett Horton and Jean Dixon, who come up against the society crowd at a party. Hepburn gives a beautiful performance as a young woman who wants to break free, and Ayres is heartbreaking as a man who can't. Grant, of course, is in the kind of role he did best in his early career, a young man from the wrong side of the tracks who is an independent spirit. He does some great gymnastics in the film, and he and Hepburn have a wonderful moment where she stands on his shoulders, and they fall into head rolls. Really marvelous stuff. The only problem I have is that the character of Julia, the younger sister, is so uptight and shallow, it's amazing that Johnny fell for her at all. Since they met while she was vacationing in Lake Placid, the audience must assume that out of the family home, she was more fun and playful, but when she comes up against her father, she falls right in with him.Hepburn and Grant worked together in "Bringing Up Baby," "The Philadelphia Story," and this film - actually, three films in a row - plus "Sylvia Scarlett." One wishes they had appeared together even more. They had great chemistry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A romp in the playroom for Cary &amp; Kate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a moderately enjoyable movie which features Cary &amp; Kate showing off their modest acting skills &amp; superior acrobatic skills. The supporting cast is outstanding &amp; plays it cool while Kate, as usual, over-emotes. The key scenes are played in Kate's "playroom" where the good guys assemble for heart-to-heart talks. In the end Cary is forced to dump his money-grubbing fiancee for her fun-loving sister played by Kate. These kind of 30s plots with clear black-and-white choices (and film) seem simplistic by today's more nuanced treatment of similar themes. Kate &amp; Cary seem to be at home in these sort of comedies, where they each seem to play their notions of themselves. Later in life they grew to play scripted roles. All of that being said, I still liked Holiday.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, along with "The Awful Truth", "The Philadelphia Story", and "Mr. Deeds", quite possibly the greatest of the screwball comedies. It's an epicurean polemic against the work ethic. Rather, it represents an internalization of the work ethic, working upon bettering one's soul, instead of for cash. Hepburn, Grant, Ayres, Horton, and Dixon are all in top form as various noncomformists (in Ayres' case, a drunken would-be noncomformist). This movie has everything, and is proof (to me at least) that romantic comedy is THE perfect genre (and no one has ever done it like Hollywood! (Take that, Euro-film snobs!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another successful Grant-Hepburn pairing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although 'Holiday' didn't fulfil my expectations overall and I found it to be a tad overrated, viewing it is still an enjoyable experience due to the presence of it's two stars, Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn.Katharine sails into her usual black-sheep role of the 30's with ease and precision, although here she is not playing a prim, haughty rich girl but a rich yet down-to-earth gal. She is Linda Seton, the sister of Julia (Doris Nolan, who is really the haughty one). Julia is engaged to Johnny Case (Cary Grant, in a good performance)and brings him to meet the Seton clan. They all expect Johnny to go into big business after the marriage, but this is not what Johnny wants out of life. He's an adventurous spirit, spontaneous (I love the somersaults! Cary Grant shows off his athletic ability, being a former trapeze artist, in this one)and he just wants to spend the next few years on a sort of 'Holiday'. Socially-aware Julia is horrified at the thought, but Linda is understanding. She begins to fall for him early but she must keep her feelings hidden for fear of upsetting her sister. Johnny starts to doubt his choice of sister as it becomes apparent that Linda is really his soulmate and the girl for him.This film is about love, and following your heart's instinct. It's not up there with other Grant-Hepburn films such as 'Bringing Up Baby' and 'The Philadelphia Story' but it's a pleasant vehicle for the two stars. It has some comedic touches which benefit the overall product, but it has a tendency to drag towards the ending.7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always loved the comedies of this era. So clever an innocent, and this is no expectation. Starring the lovely Katharine Hepburn and the handsome Cary Grant, how can this not work? Their chemistry is clear - that's probably why they made so many films together. It is a lovely film from straight away. The storyline is clear: two people want to get married - one is an ordinary joe and one is a rich millionaire heiress, and of course, the father does not approve. Although this is not my favourite comedy of this era, it is in my top 10 - one of the best, I would say. Very good acting, great script, great story. If you want a laugh, you cannot go wrong with 'Holiday'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As always, Kate and Cary are fabulous together! This is definitely one of my favorite classics. It's more romance than hijinks, but they still managed to add some fun into it (the circus/gymnastics scene). Seeing Cary Grant (and later Katharine Hepburn, as well) do a somersault makes me smile every time. Though it wasn't quite as fun as Bringing Up Baby, it was still a good pairing and a good movie overall. Lew Ayres (playing Kate's alcoholic brother) was also excellent in his small, but striking role. He's definitely an underrated actor. The only one who annoyed me was Doris Nolan (playing Kate's sister, who's engaged to Cary in the film)...but I guess she was supposed to. If you love the Kate/Cary combo and equally love old movies, then this is a must-see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wrong Sister</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In New York, the simple and free-spirited Johnny Case (Cary Grant) tells his close friends Professor Nick Potter (Edward Everett Horton) and his wife Susan Elliott Potter (Jean Dixon) that he is in love with Julia Seaton (Doris Nolan), a girl that he met in Lake Placid in his first vacation after many years of work. When Johnny arrives at Julia's mansion, he realizes that she is the daughter of the millionaire Edward Seton (Henry Kolker) and is introduced to her sister and black-sheep of the family Linda Seton (Katharine Hepburn) and her drunken brother Edward 'Ned' Seton (Lew Ayres). Edward Sr. finds that the honest and sincere Johnny has a great potential in business and schedules the engagement dinner for the New Year Eve. Along the days, Linda tries to convince Johnny to forget his dreams and to accept the position offered by her father in his bank, while Linda becomes closer to Johnny, falling secretly in love for him but supporting her sister and Johnny together. When Johnny decides to travel in a ship with Nick and Susan to Europe, Julia and Linda have to decide what lifestyle they wish to have in the near future."Holiday" is a delightful and charming romantic comedy with a witty screenplay that is not dated. The characters are very well developed and the acting is top-notch. Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant show an amazing chemistry and in spite of being predictable, the final message telling that people should follow their dreams and their hearts is wonderful. I regret only the shameful behavior of the distributor Columbia do Brasil that released the Brazilian DVD (Region 4) with Extras without subtitles in Portuguese, showing a total lack of respect with costumers that can not understand English. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Bo?mio Encantador" ("Charming Bohemian")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film a lot--thanks mostly to some wonderful performances and a pretty decent plot. Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn were excellent in the film and the writing was top-notch as well. And, for once, I really don't have any complaints about a film! The movie is a remake of a 1930 film (which I have unfortunately not been able to yet see) about a fun-loving guy who thinks he's met the girl of his dreams on a vacation and asks her to marry him. All this actually occurs before the movie begins. As the film starts, he is going to her home and finds that she's not the woman he expected--she comes from an incredibly wealthy family. Grant isn't upset at all about this--he likes the sudden prospect of a rich wife. But, what he doesn't realize is that she and her father are super-controlling and have no intention of letting him live the carefree life he's always envisioned. Over time, it becomes obvious that it isn't Grant that the girl loves, but her vision of what she can mold him into! Along the way, he also meets her alcoholic brother and free-spirited sister (Hepburn). Hepburn and Grant have a lot in common and eventually it becomes clear Hepburn is falling in love with her future brother-in-law! I don't really want to discuss the movie further, as it would spoil the film. But, the film is an excellent tale about finding the balance between money and success as well as happiness and personal freedom. The movie is quite charming and intelligently written and is well worth your time.A final note--Although few would consider Ms. Hepburn sexy or even attractive in a traditional Hollywood sense, she is at her most radiant in this film. Part of it may be that her cheeks seem a bit fuller and less gaunt than usual--regardless, it is Hepburn at her most beautiful.</fullReview>

He meets her (rich) family but it quickly becomes apparent that Julia is not the girl for him but in fact, it's her sister Linda (Hepburn) that is Grant's soul mate.It's a wonderful film and the only one i can think of that allowed Grant to show off the acrobatic skills he learnt in England. The moment when he slinks down his chair, rolls over and then flips back up onto his feet is impressive to say the least.This is a gentle comedy and when you consider that Grant and Hepburn would go on to make more biting comedies only a few years later it really does make this film stand out as a warm, delicious and subtle romantic comedy that is almost, a perfect film.The scenes in the bedroom are especially rewarding Probably Grant and Hepburn's greatest collaboration</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"When I find myself in a position like this, I ask myself: what would General Motors do? And then I do the opposite"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nonconformity was not a commonly embraced topic in the late 1930s - in the heat of the second world war, traditional, reassuring values were heralded more often than not, in an attempt to provide stability and hope to a world drastically in need of them. Bearing that in mind, it is all the more surprising to see that an unconventional comedy such as Holiday asking audiences to sympathize with a cheerful free thinker, breaking away from repressive ties of conformity and materialism, was not only made but a remake of a previous version, made only eight years prior, itself an adaptation of The Philadelphia Story scribe Philip Barry's play. However, unconventional or not, Holiday proves one of the most thoroughly enjoyable comedies of its time, and just as intelligent and witty in a contemporary context. Like certain other comedies of its time, Holiday stands out due to its noteworthy serious streak in the midst of the comic wittiness and silliness. The film's underlying themes of rebelling against claustrophobic conformity and convention, the rejection of materialistic lifestyles and class struggles are particularly poignant in a current day context, as it becomes abundantly clear how ahead of its time such messages and the film in general were. However, while for the most part the film remains ahead of itself in social politics, the implied message that either party in a marriage should just learn to peaceably change and ignore their own wants and desires, giving way to the other party comes across as rather unsettling in a current day context, despite its being a product of its time. Thankfully this line of thought is merely alluded to, and the vast majority of the film remains remarkably politically correct for 1938. With steady, confident directing by George Cuckor and a gem of a script, filled with consistent perfectly calibrated comic lines and a surprisingly feasible romance, it is hard to imagine Holiday having not been a hit. And while the film's moral undertones do become a touch heavy handed and melodramatic towards the end (the play's theatrical origins become far more apparent with a series of monologues) the moments of screwball silliness and perfectly timed back and forth comic banter are a huge highlight, keeping the tone mercifully light, even in the heavier scenes.The immense charisma of Cary Grant lights up the screen, proving one of the film's foremost assets, as his presence offers a noticeable lift to the film just as much as his character does to the Seton family. With quirky charm (showcasing many of his circus learned tumbling acrobatics) and suave wit, undercut with just enough of a tragic touch to add dramatic credulity to his performance, Holiday proves one of Grant's most impressive performances. Similarly, Katherine Hepburn is on top form as the impulsive young woman who refuses to bend to her materialistic family's expectations, and Hepburn's pitch perfect comic delivery (her back and forth banter with Grant is superb) and tremendous screen presence make for one of the most fleshed out female characters of the era. Doris Nolan convincingly portrays Grant's once endearing fiancée who slowly becomes consumed by her family's conservative values and Henry Kolker is a powerful presence as the family's menacing patriarch. However, Lew Ayres is endlessly endearing as Hepburn's 'alcoholic with a heart of gold' brother, perfectly balancing pathos and humour, and Edward Everett Horton (reprising his role from the 1930 version) and Jean Dixon are a scream as a liberal minded professor and his slightly loopy wife, leading to many a moment of much needed irreverent hilarity and many of the film's best lines. Charming and enjoyable while simultaneously thought provoking, Holiday offers just as much heartfelt social reflection as it does belly laughs. Any fans of the stars will be thrilled to see them operating at the top of their considerable games, and for any seeking a thoroughly enjoyable classic comedy with just a sufficient dash of dramatic gravitas need look no further than Holiday.-9/10</fullReview>

Johnney does not realize that he is fallen in love with a very rich young lady and when he calls on her in order to ask for her fathers permission to marry Julia he is quite surprised with the large home in which they all dwell in. It seems that both of these daughters seem to fall in love with Johnney Case and Linda tries to hide this fact and encourages Julia to marry Johnney. There is some problems that occur between wanting to make money all your life or just get off the merry-go-round and be just an ordinary person and take time to enjoy the real pleasures of living.

		<shortDescription>An excellently written, directed, and performed, timeless romantic comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie delivers in every aspect of what a viewer should expect from a classic romantic comedy--the tension of romance juxtaposed with the light-heartedness of comedy. The enjoyable tension, in this case, is quickly delivered when it becomes obvious to the viewer that Cary Grant's character is marrying the wrong sister and perhaps marrying into the wrong social class.Director George Cuckor does an excellent job in bringing this smartly written script to the screen, demonstrating most adeptly, the power of interpersonal chemistry. Each actor in this film is incredibly well cast as they each have a chemistry with one another that helps tell the story and demonstrate the heart of each character.Katherine Hepburn is superb in her portrayal of the very deep feeling "black sheep" of the Seton family. Hepburn delivers a touching and smart performance that brings the viewer along for a fun and emotionally rewarding ride. For Katherine Hepburn fans, this movie is an excellent example of why we love her so. Cary Grant is Hepburn's equal in delivering the fullness of life to his character. We are on his side from the moment the film begins.When Hepburn and Grant interact on screen, we are perhaps unaware that we are smiling and somehow lost in their seamless and enjoyable banter. We, of course, see the inevitable conclusion before they do, and wait with anticipation to see if the story will deliver. This movie is a "must see" for hopeless (and not-so-hopeless) romantics who love stories of the classical silver screen variety and happy endings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too, too marvellous...!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The final pairing of Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant brings them together under Hepburn's dear friend and best director, George Cukor, working off a brilliant screenplay written by Donald Ogden Stewart (based on the Philip Barry play of the same title). Grant plays the free-spirited Johnny Case, who thinks he's in love with the wrong rich girl throughout the movie. Julia Seton is worlds away from her determined and fiercely independent sister Linda (Hepburn), and it doesn't take a great stretch of the imagination to realise which sister Johnny is right for, and who he will end up with.But the journey to the ending is a wonderfully fun one to take--from the witty dialogue, the charming co-stars (especially Lew Ayres as Neddy Seton) and the chemistry between Hepburn and Grant... through to those delightful scenes in the playroom, where both Hepburn and Grant show off their natural athletic prowess and appear to be having the times of their lives. Cukor's light directorial touch, again (as always) favouring the actors, is a delight to behold.Grant is definitely in his element here--he's charming, he's vibrant, and his character almost leaps off the screen, beckoning you to join him in the story. Hepburn, again playing a role that seems tailor-made to her particular beauty and talents, proves that there's simply no one better at playing the unconventional female character than... well, Katharine Hepburn. (Incidentally, she understudied the role of Linda for an earlier stage version of Holiday--she also chose a scene from the play as her first screen test for Hollywood. The screen test was shown at a wrap party celebrating the end of filming, and, in her words, "the company laughed themselves sick". Thank goodness she's improved since then!)Although Hepburn and Grant sizzled more in The Philadelphia Story, and charmed their way even faster into the audiences' hearts in Bringing Up Baby, this little gem of a romantic dramedy (for it is hardly a screwball comedy) is a definite must-watch. Why not take a holiday from your own life and troubles, and settle back with Johnny and Linda? You might learn something about the value of life and living along the way. If not, you can still admire two top-notch performances from two of the best actors ever to grace the silver screen.</fullReview>

Like all of the other (film versions of) Barry's plays that I've seen, this is a slightly dated and mannered, but it has clever dialogue and some very funny moments. The story is that Grant is a poor but "everything else you could want in a son-in-law" young man, and is brought to meet the family of his fiancee (the sister is played by Hepburn). Grant does an excellent job humanizing a character that could easily be just a plot device, and Horton and Dixon are hoot as an academic couple that are friends of Grant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Closer Look at the Serious Subtext</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Character-based comedy done with an expertly light touch and featuring Katherine Hepburn in her sophisticated prime. Beneath the light-hearted gloss, however, lies a subtext very much attuned to the period. Screenwriter Stewart (later blacklisted) clearly knows his way around the drawing rooms and boardrooms of the Wall St. wealthy and the movie itself seldom strays from these moneyed precincts. Key to the subtext is the notion that money and its accumulation are proper ends in themselves. This is clearly the belief of patriarch Edward Seton (Kolker, in a fine performance) who rules his family with a stuffy firmness that insists on the privileges and connections that only wealth can provide. Daughter Julia (Nolan) goes along, floating on the prosperous family carpet in what amounts to a carefree life. But crucially for plot development, she's also more natural without Dad's stuffiness. The other daughter Linda (Hepburn), however, is something of a rebel and has retreated into her dead mother's room where she finds needed warmth and solace. Meanwhile, brother Ned (Ayres) has retreated into drink now that his musical talents have been frustrated by the overbearing father. It may not exactly be a happy household, still there are the consolations of servants, mansion, and glitter to keep things together.Into this mix comes catalyst Johnny (Grant). Right away we know he's a man of the people even though he's completed a brilliant financial deal connecting him to Julia's elite social circle. Soon after meeting the two become engaged. But now Johnny has to come to the mansion, meet the family, and pass Dad's tyrannical muster. The trouble is that once Johnny bridles at Dad's strictly mercenary values, Julia is pressed into making a choice between maintaining her accustomed life-style by sticking with Dad's side or risking a less predictable future with the more free-spirited Johnny. Complicating the mix is the other daughter, Linda, who has been living vicariously through the more sociable Julia. However, once Johnny arrives, we discover that Linda is something of a latent free spirit, waiting to break out from her self-imposed isolation. Naturally, she is drawn to Johnny, but at the same time she must remain loyal to her sister, while Johnny is torn between the two sisters since each represents a side of his own make-up.What's interesting about these characters is that each has a side that has gone undeveloped until they begin interacting with one another and the mercenary values that the family patriarch represents. In effect, each must come to terms with what money means in his or her life before becoming the person each really is. It's this sorting through process that makes up the story's provocative subtext. And it's to director Cukor's and writer Stewart's credit that the various contretemps are treated in such amusing and humane fashion. Tellingly, the only character treated in unsympathetic fashion is the snobbish cousin Seton (the expert Henry Daniell in a typical frosty role). Note that it's he who makes the implied slur on the politics of the New Deal.Though the film doesn't deal explicitly with the politics of the time, the implications are there nonetheless. Depression times were hard. Ordinary people were suffering. Concern in the arts often took the form of praising the virtues of the common person (Ma Joad's little speech in Grapes of Wrath). Now none of the main characters here are clock-punchers, but clearly Johnny represents certain "down to earth" values identified with working people and thus indirectly with the New Deal's concern with their plight. Thus Johnny suggests the intrusion of New Deal values within the insulated walls of established wealth, and I expect audiences of the time happily understood this. On the other hand, old man Seton comes across as fossilized traditional wealth that's even forgotten what money is for. Thus displacing folks like him at the top of the heap is no loss. Rather the rise of the Johnny's of the financial world represents a return of wealth to the needs of a fulfilling life instead of simply amassing money and status for their own sake. At the same time, I don't think it's an accident that Johnny's best friend is a professor (Horton). Roosevelt's celebrated Brain Trust advising him on economic recovery was made up of academics recruited at the time in unprecedented numbers. In fact, there was something of an unspoken alliance between ordinary people and academics against the entrenched power of old wealth seen as having brought about the economic collapse. Following this line, the movie can be viewed as suggesting that the economy of the late 1930's has split into two sides. On one side are the reformed capitalists, the New Dealers, represented by Johnny (remember, he's quite good at finance), and on the other by the anti-New Dealers, such as old man Seton, jealously guarding their traditional prerogatives. So when the pivotal Linda finally abandons her sanctuary for the wider world and Johnny, the movie is indicating that a new opportunity (The New Deal) has emerged out of an old past (The Anti-New Deal) that can liberate those free spirits bold enough to seize the chance. I expect audiences of the time approved.None of this effort at a deeper look is meant to imply that the movie can't be enjoyed for its own sake apart from the issues of the time. All in all, Holiday remains a fine piece of slickly amusing entertainment and Hollywood craftsmanship that holds up quite well despite the years. But I do think a subtext emerges that's worth examining for those underlying values that remain relevant to our own financially stressed times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Happy "Holiday" is Now a DVD On Hepburn's 100th.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today,May 12th,would have been Katharine Hepburn's 100th birthday. To mark this occaision,fans of hers,like myself,buy,rent or check out from the library,as many movies as possible to view. It was also 75 years ago in 1932 that she made her film debut,so we have 2 occasions to celebrate.I got very lucky and today was able to watch a perfectly brand new DVD copy,of the now considered a classic "Holiday". The movie was not that successful when released in 1938,due to the well known "Kate is box office poison" label branded on her in the 30's.As some have said here,"Holiday" has a storyline that pre-dates the ideals of the late 1960's 30 years before-hand. Cary Grant is a 30 year old man who has had to work,one way or another,since he was 10. Now twenty years later in 1938 he's on the verge of making a business deal that will afford him the time and money to "take a break and live while he's young enough to enjoy it." He meets Julia Seton at Lake Placid (a now lost opening scene deleted from the movie,according to the DVD extra). He falls for her and blindly believes she wants the same things he does and will follow his lead. The fact is,Julia has been well "trained" by her father in believing making money and being successful are important,far above anything else in life,even love.Julia's sister is Linda,played by Hepburn who is considered the black sheep of the family for she will not submit to the conforming ways of the rich upper class. As anyone can tell in the first hour,Johnny Case (Grant) should be with Linda instead of Julia. Linda has completely fallen for Johnny herself but would not cut in on her sister,despite the fact they're so wrong for each-other.Brother Edward Seton is an alcoholic who,thanks to his father's stern ways,has deprived him of his human right to be what he wishes and therefore has lost any hope of being what he wants to be. All three Seton "kids" are in their 30's and why they don't leave home and get out from under their father's thumb is not brought up.Johnny's best friends the Potter's (or is it Porter? ha-ha)played by Jean Dixon and Edward Everett Horton are older but delightfully non-conformist and fun. (Horton in the 1960's was the narrator for "Fractured Fairy Tales" on "The Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle Show".) They are not thrilled with the prospect of Johnny's choice or the fact that he'd have to compromise his freedom and life's desires to be part of the Seton crowd.The playroom scenes are "playful",funny and in some cases ad-libbed. I like when Hepburn says the giraffe looks like her and she poses head to head with it. The greatest thing about "Holiday" is the against the grain of the times message of "to thine own self be true".In other words,one should live up to their own expectations and not those of others and what society says is acceptable and the norm. There have always been people in the world who have done the opposite of what society dictates as "normal" but "Holiday" is one of the few movies of Hollywood's golden age to dare tell their story on the big screen for all to see. Bravo! Here's to Katharine Hepburn,to the cast and that this and more of her films are out on DVD this month. (END)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A charming comedy about dreams and life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fun comedy based on a play by Phillip Barry is worth watching. Holiday is the story of a young man, Johnny Case (played wonderfully by Cary Grant who shows off some of his vaudeville tricks), who finds himself engaged to the daughter of a millionaire. Except for the family black sheep, Linda (Katharine Hepburn) and her alcoholic brother Ned (Lew Ayres), Johnny feels pressure to abandon all his dreams to become a run of the mill moneymaker. He must make the decision that could change his life forever, the question is, who and what will he choose?Holiday is a pleasantly amusing comedy from the 1930s. It is often hilarious, but what makes this comedy special is it's bittersweet message about following your heart and dreams. This is a movie that showcases great writing, it is a joy to watch how all the pieces unfold and how the characters develop and grow. I especially enjoyed the complex family dynamics of the Seton family. We start with the family core, the father, the leader, Edward Seton. He is a man of set values, he is stubborn and knows the value of the dollar. A man's worth is weighed in how much he can earn. He shapes the rest of his family, for better and for worse. Next in line comes his daughter Linda, the family black sheep. She doesn't fit in with the family, she resembles her dead mother and admires her greatly. Like Katharine Hepburn, who plays her she is independent, intelligent and freethinking. She has a passion for art, literature and life. Next up is Edward's second daughter, the beautiful Julie Seton, who is engaged to marry Johnny. At first glance she is a sensible young woman in love, who is only concerned about the future, but as the film progresses it becomes increasingly clear she is a picture cut out of her father. She believes in wealth, success and money above all things, she does not stop until she gets her way. Finally, the youngest child, Ned enters the picture, a young man who is never far from a drink. He is perhaps the most hurt by the pressure to be successful, as a boy his ambition was to become a musician but his father would not allow it. So Ned, stumbles through life with a drink in his hand working at a job he hates, for the most part only to please his father. Like Linda, he is somewhat of a black sheep, he believes in Johnny cause, because it could have easily been his own. Lew Ayres gives an unforgettable performance as Ned, stealing several scenes with well-delivered one-liners, and his almost overbearing uncaring attitude. However is somewhat of a tragic figure, nonetheless he is amusing and likable. How does poor Johnny Case fit in this mess? Well, he barely does. A man who has no connections, no prior wealth, he is simply new money with big ideas to most of the family. He seems to be the only one satisfied by his life and his dreams, until the meddling start. The question soon becomes evident; did Johnny fall for the wrong sister? You'll have to see the end to find out. An interesting setting to the film is a room designed by the late-wife of Mr. Edward Seton. It is a room you'd find almost in every house, except perhaps the mansion in which the Seton's live. It is cozy, warm, small? and it harbors all the dreams and ambitions of the children's pasts. All of Ned's instruments remain here, untouched by time, as is Linda's trapeze she used to play on with her cousin. Only Julie seems underrepresented in this room. She is without dreams, even back to her childhood. It is revealed through this room she is not an exciting, passionate woman that Johnny feels he has fallen for. She is simply Julie, a girl who feels for Johnny's potential rather than for himself. Many important scenes take place in this room, it is home, and it is one of the only places left untouched by Mr. Seton. It's where you can share your dreams and memories with a smile, it's where you can go back to your childhood or move forward into your most wonderful dreams. I already mentioned the wonderful supporting performance by Lew Ayres, however he was not the only one to shine. Cary Grant plays Johnny, the everyman with big dreams perfectly. He has the childish whimsy of a boy, but the seriousness of a firm adult when needed. Grant is a joy to watch, he comes across as a agreeable, kind and cheerfully funny. Katharine is also wonderful, in a rather subdued performance. Sometimes I feel she can come off over the top, but in Holiday she manages to restrain herself until it truly is necessary to let go. She manages perfectly Linda, the strong woman who is deeply confused about life.In the end, Holiday is a film about life, happiness and dreams. It's about being able to see life for more than an opportunity to make more money. We are met with a wide variety of characters, all of which money impacts them in a serious way. In the case of some characters it's damaging, in others it's blinding. It's only the lucky few who let it leave their minds, because they are much busier looking at the only thing that truly matters in life: Love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Thoroughly Beautiful Experience; a Memorable Mixture of Elements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Holiday" is a rare satire, a comedy of ideas.. Written by Philip Barry, author of "The Philadelphis Story", it takes on the super-rich class in the 1930s in the middle of the Depression their Washington manipulator cronies caused. To do this, Barry gives us Johnny Case, played by Cary Grant, who only wants to get away for a few years, break out of lockstep, and decide if high finance is for him. His simple desire throws all the tyrannical plans his fiancée's family has for him, and them, including a business-dictated honeymoon, pre-determined lifestyle, house and career, into a cocked hat. The only one who supports the young man's decision is Kathharine Hepburn as Linda, the rebellious younger daughter of the family. Prominent in the cast also are Edward Everett Horton and his wife as non-upper-class friends of Johnny, Lew Ayres as her embittered alcoholic brother, and icy and a but stagy Doris Lloyd as the bride to be. As the father of this Roman-Imperial dysfunctional family, Henry Kolker is very cold also and more- than-adequate. Henry Daniell and Binnie Barnes are also featured prominently. The true climax of the film is not Johnny's understandable doubts about what looked like a simple personal decisions at the start but Hepburn's touching try to do something normative. She begs for the chance to stage her sister's pre-wedding party, just that, for once without interference, editing, or changes dictated by conformity, the desire to impress or bribe anyone. Of course her plea falls on very deaf parental ears; she refuses to attend the party. But when Johnny breaks off the engagement and leaves, she cheers for him...and goes after him to win him for herself if she can. The direction is good although the play seems to be a stage play reworked here and there; the pace is excellent. This is a quality production and perhaps the best early work Hepburn ever did. It is also as powerful an indictment of the Knoxian-Lutheran-Franklinite super-rich class in the United States as pretending to be capitalists but being connected dictator-types as anyone drew up before The Fountainhead" and "The Hucksters". The manipulative, emotionally-denying coldness that was holding Tracy Samantha Lord back in "The Philadelphia Story" is exposed here for what it is--the need for petty dictator types to insulate themselves from the reality they are harming by surrounding themselves with mirror images of themselves. What they fear is any man who thinks for himself, since he can see the emperor has no clothes; that's why they must not allow Johnny to define and to seek his own happiness.. This is an important. moving and sometimes funny film about two young people., brave ones, who think for themselves and dare to try to define what happiness is before they commit to seeking it by the usual and wrong means. It has a lovely climax, a lovely ending and an unusually fine and psychologically challenging story line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I often list this movie as my #1 film pick of all time. That means a lot to me. The central myth -- that someone can see the problem with wealth and position and hold out for something more, as well as find the unique person he belongs with -- really works for me, I guess.Plus the performances are sparkling -- Cary Grant is as wonderful as ever, maybe more than ever, Katharine Hepburn is perfection as the rich girl who wants more, and supporting players like Lew Ayres, Edward Everett Horton and Jean Dixon are also marvelous -- the sets are great, the costumes just right, and the writing is tart and on-target.All in all, a wonderful movie. I pull it out every year at New Year's and I'm never sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grant and Hepburn have loads of fun in this and have a real chemistry going.It serves well also as a social commentary and a lot of its insights could be used in a film of today. How making money is not the be all and end all, that time should be taken just to have fun or explore and just be. Cukor sets it up amazingly well, with Grant getting engaged to the wrong sister before he meets Hepburn and then the fun begins as he realizes his error and the total disparity of his own and the wrong sister's aspirations. I have seen his movie 3 times and it never fails to fully engage me, its humour and wit is marvellous, the background hums with the artificial lives of the well to do and the foreground with the slow dawning of the falling in love of the two stars. I give this a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a disappointment Holiday was. I thought that with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn, I would be in for a treat. I loved them both in Bringing up Baby, but Holiday really lacked some of the energy of Bringing up Baby. The cinematography was really flat and lifeless. Only the beginning when Grant's character first came into the huge foyer was the only time that I was impressed it really made it seem bigger than life. The first half hour was the best and I loved Grant in this part of the film, where I really loved his character until it seemed to lose some of the humor half way through the film. Granted, it was amusing and at times witty, particularly the dialogue of his two friends as well as Hepburn's character's brother. I was also disappointed in Hepburn, who although her part was well acted did not seem real to me. It was a bit annoying. There did not appear to be the same type of chemistry between Grant and Hepburn. This was the same director as Dinner at Eight which had the similar static scenes and semi-witty dialogue. I liked that film better. What I did like was the theme that being wealthy does not mean everything and in fact could make live more boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't do anything for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was boring... super boring... super predictable. A successful idealistic young man meets his wealthy fiancé's family for the first time -- and they're rich... and shallow... and try to make him ~make money... and be more successful... and are shallow... and judgmental... and talk about people behind their back. He just wants to spend a few months or years travelling the world aimlessly. He meets his match in a jaded young woman played by Katherine Hepburn. All the lines are clichés, which basically have the meaning 'being rich or successful doesn't matter, what matters is being happy!' and 'rich people are shallow.' This movie feels dated and Linda's angst comes across as just spoiled; I find it very hard to relate to her. She's also extremely actressy and overdone in this film, giving long and dramatic monologues about her situation (as a rich beautiful young woman who's the black sheep of her family and refuses to settle down.) I really don't get the problem, there seems to be no plot, and while Cary Grant is as charming and insightful as ever he doesn't seem to quite mesh with the incredibly unlikable Hepburn. I did like the dissolute brother, who played a part with humor. And of course the lovely scenery and costumes of the period, almost over the top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A (nearly) overlooked classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Holiday' is one of those smart, well-written classic comedies that seems to click with just about everyone who sees it, so it's always been a bit of a mystery to me that it has been relatively neglected. The film today appears to have fallen in distinction when compared to other Cary Grant-Katherine Hepburn pairings, but for my money it's the best of their movies together. 'The Philadelphia Story' will naturally have its defenders, and it is a terrific film as well, but far more conventional (and a little contrived) in its resolutions.Either way, George Cukor's work of this era has stood the test of time much better than that of Howard Hawks in my estimation; one need only witness the painfully forced "zaniness" of 'Bringing Up Baby'. Hawks was too intimidated by the big stars he cast, and as such gave them free rein without much attention to making his films stylish as well. Cukor's concentration on the natural rhythms of the narrative in 'Holiday' make for a far more complete movie than the empty rapid-fire dialogue of a Hawks film, and his sympathy for non-conformity coupled with the casual, wry wit of the screenplay makes the film feel shockingly contemporary even today.I'd rank this as the greatest of all screwball comedies, so with any luck more people will seek it out and finally get to see a Hepburn-Grant comedy that's as down-to-earth as it is funny.Rating: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was all about the beauty of Katherine Hepburn. She was the life of the family and the life of the party. Her face is radiant, her energy unfailing, her feeling exposed everywhere. The movie plot was sappy and uber-predictable, as are almost all movies. The house was funny - so big as to be laughable, I think the set designers were having fun with American audiences. There was also a visible kind of incoherence between the all-American down-to-earth fun-loving daughters and the overdressed, overserious father. It wasn't just a contrast, it was not very realistic. Not that seriously wealthy people can't have playboys in the family, not that industrialists can't be all-business all the time, I think it was not well thought through (that's not a criticism of the screenwriters, just an observation about those film times). It was Cary-Katherine semi-screwball happiness versus the stodgy father-daughter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard - make that impossible - to believe that just after making both this and 'Bringing Up Baby', again playing opposite Grant, that Hepburn was labeled 'box-office poison' by the distributors of 'middle' America and forced to flee to Broadway where she prevailed upon Philip Barry to write 'The Philadelphia Story' for her. It was a good choice for 'Holiday' itself had been written by Barry and played on Broadway in 1928. There's nothing terribly original about the philosophy that life is organised the wrong way round so that we work consistently through our 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s to accummulate sufficient funds for a comfortable retirement which we're then too worn out to enjoy to the full. The only flaw in this philosophy is that most people HAVE to work and saddle themselves along the way with responsibilites and/or debts that make it impossible to invert the cycle. But what IF, by some luck, chance, hard work or whatever, it WERE possible to take a long breather at say, 30, enjoy life for about ten years and then come back to the rat race. That, essentially is the position in which Johnny Case (Cary Grant) finds himself at the outset of this story. Great, but where's the conflict. Glad you asked that, it comes in the shape of Julia Seton, a girl with whom he's fallen in love without bothering to check her background. Turns out she's Miss Moneybags personified and more or less averse to Johnny's dream. Luckily she has a sister, Linda (Hepburn) made of sterner stuff and happy to follow Johnny and his dream wherever the wind blows them. Throw in another unconventional couple, Edward Everett Horton and Binnie Barnes, simmer on a low light and before you know it you have a soufflé light as the steps of Astaire. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I almost always take a remake with a grain of salt. In this case I make an exception, because I had the opportunity to see the original. HOLIDAY is a pretty good comedy. Thematic perhaps a little worn, but dramatic and acting is very good.Cukorov film on freedom of mind, serenity and true love is a good guess. It brings together a disheartened woman of revolutionary spirit and a career-man who dreams of indolent bliss, their romance kindled in fraught circumstances, and offers a refreshing slant in a romantic-comedy genre frequently hampered by insipid characterization.I think it's growing chemistry between Grant and Hepburn again been hit. It is equally expressed in the comedic and serious situations. The two are a perfect match and the chemistry increases in the culmination of the film.Grant (Johnny Case) a hard-working man who opens wide paths in life. Doris Nolan (Julia Seton) is glamorous and obsessed position and wealth. Cukor tried to alleviate, as much as he could, this difference in levels of society. So that she felt most in comical situations. The relationship is a critical human factor. Katharine Hepburn (Linda Seton) It is unusual lively and fun Julia's sister. Johnny's soul mate and a very positive character. It's a little spoiled, stubborn and disobedient. Just enough to win over the audience. I have the impression that Linda wants to please everyone, but at least to itself. Love is the factor that it finally align the cubes. Lew Ayres (brother Ned Seton) is a good-natured drunkard who sees, hears and feels, and has the courage to confront his father. The man destroyed in spirit. Henry Kolker (Edward Seton) is strictly business banker, who only future for their children see the money. Johnny's friends Nick (Edward Everett Horton) and Susan Potter (Jean Dixon) are very entertaining. As such, they are the voice of reason on the one side and on the other side.This film is quite interesting, but thought it was not found the back of the former audience. People are not crazy about the rich love games.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There may not be a more likable combination of actors than Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn. The great thing is, they would still be stars even if they were actors today. Of course I love this film. It's coming up on 80 years old pretty soon, but it isn't dated at all. I'm actually really surprised that it hasn't been remade all this time. It's just an incredibly cheerful movie from the get-go. Grant &amp; Hepburn have immediate chemistry as soon as they connect on screen together.The story involves Case (Grant) falling in love with a woman, Julia, played by Doris Nolan. He really wants to take a 'Holiday' and find out who he really is instead of continuing to work. Julia is more lenient towards staying around by her father and have him help support them. Case, being the independent man he is has a lot of trouble with this idea. It's only till he connects with Julia's sister, Linda, played by Hepburn, that he relates to the family. The film doesn't have an exact focus after about 40 minutes of family room talk, but it flows really well. I wasn't too worried about where it's going because by the cover of the movie and the stars involved, I think it was pretty obvious. I do think when the problem comes up they could have tackled the issue sooner. For example, I didn't think Hepburn had that big of a daddy issue until almost an hour in.The brother, Ned, turns out to have most of the comedic relief and does a fantastic job with it. He captures that dry drunk humor we all know and love. The highlights are mostly with Hepburn in the latter half. But what I think was most gratifying about Holiday was how romantic it was. It's the type of film that isn't trying to shove romance down your throat but it ends up pulling your heart strings anyway. I think it would be a huge success with people if it was released today. Hepburn makes quick love believable and Grant is one of the most likable actors of all time. I don't know how you cant love this film. Not to mention it involves the classic couch moment with Grant and Hepburn.+Chemistry &amp; charisma with leads +Ned's one-liners +Believable and timeless +Romantic without trying to be +Re-watchable -Tackle issues a bit sooner or make it longer! 9.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . it's really hard to be a pimp, but it's a lot tougher to be a Wall Street banker, as HOLIDAY proves. Cary Grant's character, up-by-his-bootstraps Baltimore boy "Johnny Case," does not understand what Wall Street types know before they're done sucking their Binkies: He who dies with the most money, wins. Harvard-educated utilities specialist Johnny thinks he can take his commission from closing the "Bayshore deal" and run. "Retire young, and work old," as he puts it to his right-thinking fiancée, "Julia Seton." Julia, a member of the "60 Families" (today called "The One Per Cent") patiently tries to point out the fallacies in Johnny's thinking. It's not like the fleeting pleasures of youth will do you much good in the grave. People don't build monuments to guys who Hoboed the Seven Seas. You don't build up frontage for your five-story mansion on Fifth Avenue by being a banking dilettante. Though something such as the Bayshore deal might consist of five minutes of doodling on a napkin at your country club or favorite night spot (and constitute a whole decade's profit), you've got to keep your nose to the grind stone of the yacht club and nightly champagne circuit to make sure you capture the crucial opportunity to work your brain for five minutes when it comes along every ten years or so. When that five minutes of jotting down a few figures for an appropriate counterpart from the One Per Cent (or 60 Families) bears fruit and you make as much from a few pencil strokes as ten thousand of the "Little People" can make from a lifetime of hard physical labor, it's your responsibility to build a home big enough to house an entire village of the Ordinaries, and to Party like you've died and gone to Heaven already. Since Julia just can't get these quintessential American principles through Johnny's thick skull, this sad-sack loser gets delegated to take the Seton family's "Black Sheep" off their hands.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is This Where the Club Meets?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Holiday is my favourite Cary Grant film, and my favourite of Katharine Hepburn &amp; Cary Grant's partnership. Between this, Bringing Up Baby and The Philadelphia Story, it's almost like having to choose my favourite child; yes all three are that good, but ultimately Holiday is the most beloved of my offspring. I find Kate &amp; Cary to be one of the five greatest instances of chemistry I've seen between an actor and actress (my other selections being Astaire &amp; Rogers, Powell &amp; Loy, Stewart &amp; Sullivan and Fonda &amp; Stanwyck), even preferring them to the longer running Tracy-Hepburn partnership. However the two of them aren't actually romantically engaged throughout the film, with Grant preparing to be married a different woman. Yet the whole time I'm thinking to myself Kate &amp; Cary are beyond perfect for each other; the coming together of two intellectuals. I don't want to see him being involved with someone else.I also feel Cary Grant has every looked more youthful than he does in Holiday, and even gets a rare opportunity to show off his acrobatic skills, with Hepburn even getting in on the action. I'll also take this opportunity to mention that man sure could wear clothes like no other. Katharine Hepburn had the opportunity in her career to play roles which reflected her real life personality as a non conformist odd ball, here playing just that; the black sheep in a wealth, business driven family. The discussions Kate &amp; Cary engage on what their characters want to do with their lives are so deep and profound. The difficulty of finding their place in life, the obstacles of trying to live it and not wanting to miss out on an ever changing world full of ideologies and ideas, all while trying to get by with an optimistic attitude despite the imperfections in their life. It's hard to take it all in on and decipher in a single viewing, which makes Holiday one of my most life affirming movies.The scene in which Kate &amp; Cary welcome in the new year in the playroom (also that playroom looks so much fun! You could almost set the entire movie in there) is one of the most powerful and harrowing moments I've seen in any film, with the sadness of spending New Years alone is something I can relate to. I do make it an aim during a future new year's eve to watch Holiday with the film synchronized with real time so I can introduce the new year at the exact same time the character's in the movie do so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To have much or have not ? lots of wit and fun in this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the 1930s, Hollywood cranked out far more comedies and romances than any other genres. It was the time of the Great Depression, and the U.S. and the world needed their spirits lifted. Hollywood did its part to help raise hopes with its films to make people laugh and smile. Looking back on that time now, it may seem strange that so many of the films were about the wealthy or people living a high lifestyle. But being well off and having fun were things that people often aspired to, and thus, something to keep their hopes up. So, the plots of many films were about such people living a wealthy lifestyle. Some other films, though, treated the rich from another standpoint. The wealthy were portrayed as snobbish and unhappy in the midst of all their riches. Enter Columbia's "Holiday" in June, 1938. It is a witty, clever, funny film about life ? enjoying life. There can be no doubt about the clash of the haves and have-nots in this hilarious and not subtly biting derision of money and riches for their own sake. Cary Grant, as Johnny Case, has had to work since the age of 10. Doris Nolan, as Julia Seton, imagines the thrill of business conquests. The countenance of her father, played by Henry Kolker, belies any sense of enjoyment or happiness for all his wealth. Lew Ayres as the son, Ned, and Katherine Hepburn as eldest daughter, Linda, epitomize family members whose spirits have been squelched by their wealth and social position. The only flaw in the plot is the notion that Grant's Johnny Case and Nolan's Julia Seton could fall for each other in the first place. They are at opposite ends on everything in the film. Was it mere infatuation by both, with nothing spoken or discussed between them. Of course, that's absurd. So, we're left with this strange and inexplicable situation. But, to the rescue come Edward Everett Horton and Jean Dixon as Case's close friends Professor Nick Potter and Susan Potter. The witty dialog between them and with Johnny adds life and spice to the film. The later encounters with Linda and Ned further add to the humor so we soon forget the damnable question. It still bites a bit, but we move on from wondering how Johnny and Julia ever got together and were engaged in the first place.Amidst this comedy of errors, the satire becomes more apparent as the plot unfolds. We see more and more how the enslavement of wealth suppresses individual spirits and robs people of true happiness. The screenplay, direction and acting all lend to an excellent film. One extra bonus to me is that we get to see some of Cary Grant's acrobatic skills. I can't recall any other film in which we see Grant doing flips, cartwheels and tumbles. It all adds up to an entertaining film. It is a great comedy ? with a message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent Hollywood chamber drama. Cary Grant plays an investor who dreams of saving enough money for early retirement, and then discovering his real purpose in the world. He's set to marry the daughter of a banking tycoon for whom the accumulation of wealth is everything. Almost completely set within the family's sprawling mansion, the film is essentially composed of two extended set-pieces consisting of Grant's efforts to gain the father's marriage blessing and the ensuing New Year's Eve celebration. Grant gradually learns that his fiancée is very similar to her father, but the other sister (Katharine Hepburn) finds in him a kindred spirit, and a drunkard brother (Lew Ayres) encourages their budding infatuation. There's quite a lot of pleasant humor, but also a palpable sense of deep-seated resentment and stifled dreams that play out against a well-defined family dynamic. Most beautiful are the scenes set within a rustically designed room?an escape from the father's unwavering stoicism?viewed by the estranged characters as a revivifying place where the real living happens, divorced as it is from crippling bourgeois expectations. Cukor's economical direction makes the most of the geography of several rooms and Donald Ogden Stewart's screenplay is particularly attuned to the broken relationship between the old-fashioned father and Hepburn's free-thinking dreamer, as incisively drawn here as in The Philadelphia Story. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything that "The Philadelphia Story" was, "Holiday" wasn't.If the point of Holiday's story was to convince me that the incredibly rich were just a bunch of boring, stuffy, petty, snivelling, tantrum-throwing, one-dimensional goofs (Yeah. That about covers it), then, yes, it certainly achieved its intended goal quite successfully.Holiday is a prefect example of why I generally detest and often avoid watching "Screwball" comedies from the 1930s and 40s.Its story was so contrived, predictable and riddled with every "poor-little-rich-girl" cliché in the book that it made my skin absolutely crawl in complete revulsion to everything that it supposedly stood for.One aspect of Holiday's "far-from-believable" story that really killed me had to do with the 3 spoiled-brat children (who were all around the age of 30) of wealthy banker, Edward Seton.These 3 big sucks clearly resented "daddy-dearest" for the dominating and (apparent) strangle-hold that he had on their lives. Yet these 3 little whining cry-babies continued to live under the same roof with this overbearing, money-grubbing, Wall Street monster. And that, to me, rendered them all a bunch of selfish, temperamental, hypocritical wimps as they greedily guzzled down his booze and paraded around in all of their tres' chic, designer outfits.Holiday was the sort of film whose story really sent out a very confused and mixed message about the super-wealthy set. It just couldn't decide whether it wanted the viewer to laugh at them, or to hate them, or to enviously desire to be just like them. But, whatever - This film's story was "Screwball" comedy at its absolute most detestable, in my opinion.And, besides all of that nonsense, I definitely thought that the chemistry between its 2 big-name stars, Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant, stank, big-time. And that's because there really was no chemistry between these 2, whatsoever.Of the 4 principal characters who dominated Holiday's story, it was Cary Grant's "I-just-wanna-bum-around-for-the-rest-of-my-life" role as John Case who rang the most false and pretentious.Immaculately groomed in his tailor-made suites and shiny shoes, I wasn't convinced, for even a minute, that this "good egg" wasn't even phased one bit by the possibilities available to him through all of Seton's financial wealth. To me, Case's phony, non-materialistic philosophy didn't hide the fact that beneath his apparent selfless intentions lurked a greedy, little gold-digger just waiting to pounce on all that dough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cary Grant plays Johnny Case, a fool in love, engaged to marry a girl Julia Seton who he really knows nothing about and whom he met at a winter resort. That she lives in a Manhattan mansion, complete with elevator, a private residence about the size of Buckingham Palace, well--- it all leaves him dumbfounded when he shows up at her door. Confused, taking it all in, Johnny does back flips on its grand polished floors. He meets up with his fiancée's older sister Linda, played by Katharine Hepburn, who immediately sniffs out a kindred spirit. She recognizes his discomposure: "You didn't realize what you were getting into," she tells him. "A world of stuffed shirts and mink-lined ties." Yes, Linda is the self-admitted black sheep of the family, a type completely opposite from that of Julia, the conventional, snobbish socialite adequately played by Doris Nolan. And into this family mix is added the Lew Ayres character, brother Ned who wanders around with his hand permanently attached to a whiskey glass that is subjected to constant refills. Ned is the idle, miserable son of the banker class, a sensitive soul frustrated in his ambition to pursue a career in music, a profession vetoed by his financier father. So Ned has taken the path of least resistance by becoming a professional alcoholic. Prospective groom Johnny has always been an independent guy, coming from a hardscrabble background, working since the age of ten, and now at the age of thirty has accumulated enough money to live the kind of life he feels is right and honorable for himself. He's so enamored with his dream of life, which demands a "holiday" for self-exploration, he doesn't realize that he's in love with the wrong sister. Julia wants "the golden throne." And what he wants is a life of somersaults and the acrobatic freedom of an existence not reigned in by convention. He's got some buddies rooting for him throughout, husband and wife academics who worry and fuss, and encourage him, surrogate parents devoted to his welfare. Wonderful character actors, Edward Everett Horton as Professor Potter and Jean Dixon as Mrs. Potter serve as delightful counterparts to the stuffy, moneyed world of the Seton family. Throughout Cary Grant seems to be having fun with this role, one where he can demonstrate his flair for physical comedy, a skill he retained from his early stage career pre-film. Hepburn is superb at playing a type of woman with which she has an intimate acquaintance, one very similar to whom she was in real life, a member of East Cost society with all the accompanying mannerisms and accent. The director George Cukor again shows his talent and facility in directing such an ensemble of talented actors. Who finds true love and is given the opportunity to actualize their true path in life? Watch and enjoy the fun of discovery along with the characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Case (Cary Grant) falls in love with Julia Seton (Doris Nolan) while on holiday. Despite knowing little about each other, they become engaged. The free-spirited Johnny finds he doesn't have much in common with Julia's class-obsessed family, except for her 'black sheep' sister Linda (Katharine Hepburn). Gradually Linda begins to fall for Johnny as he struggles with the contrast between what he wants out of life and what Julia wants.This is a nice George Cukor romantic comedy but I'm not as in love with it as others. Grant and Hepburn are great. This is one of Hepburn's more likable roles. But there's something about the plot that leaves me a little cold on the romance front. Basically at the end of the picture I'm left with the feeling that Grant's character is a little quick to fall in love and any potential he might have for a successful relationship with Hepburn or anybody else is doubtful. I guess that's the cynic in me coming out but the film really didn't try to appeal to the romantic. Still, it's a good film with a great director, two amazing stars, and a fine supporting cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cary Grant plays Johnny Case, a free-thinking man who is engaged to Linda Seton(played by Katharine Hepburn) who is a daughter of a millionaire, who wants Johnny to settle down and join his business, which he is reluctant to do, preferring instead to take a "holiday" for a few years while he is young, and able to enjoy it! This baffles his would-be father-in-law, though Linda and her brother Ned are sympathetic, as are Nick &amp; Susan Potter, two old friends of his. What will Johnny do? OK comedy is amiable and breezy, if talky. Amusing to an extent, but awfully frivolous too. Works because of the good acting, especially Cary Grant, who is at least sympathetic here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hepburn and Grant make the Holidays Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another hit for the Hepburn and Grant pairings, and is right up there with "Bringing Up Baby" and "The Philadelphia Story." These two stars of the golden age of Hollywood are a delight to watch in this movie.The premise of the story is Cary Grant is a down to earth simpleton engaged to an uptown, high maintenance woman whom he met only ten days before. She brings him home to meet the family and to gain daddy's approval; While there Grant meets Hepburn, his fiancé's rebellious tomboy sister. The two get on swimmingly, having the same beliefs and similar goals. Grant and Hepburn have sparkling chemistry and witty bantering conversations. Their silly fooling will have you laughing out loud like no comedy today does. The script was written to perfection, it wasn't too heavy but then it wasn't just fluff, (as most rom-coms are today.)This film was funny, sweet and endearing. The two leads are drawn to each other, each sensing in the other a kindred spirit, but the loyalty to the sister/fiancé stops the two from acting on it. You see that they are good, heartfelt, wholesome people who would compromise their own happiness for the sense of family and promises they made. It is also warming to see how certain family members support each other. The brother Ned (played by Lew Ayres) is a slight drunk, but that doesn't stop his affection for his sister (Hepburn) from showing itself. He supports her wayward ways, and even encourages her affection for her sister's fiancé. He comforts her when she is down and is in lively spirits when she is pleased.Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn both are seasoned professionals when it comes to performance in front of a camera, and while watching this movie you could argue that they have never been more compelling and believable. It seems to me that when the two are in a movie together the story, characters and life of the film jump out into reality. This movie will continue to awe and amuse generations of film-goers for years.Overall this movie is a sweet, rambunctious tale that will have you believing in serendipitous coincidence; any fan of classic films will love it, and those who aren't into the classics will have trouble finding flaw in this film. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT a comedy, but rather profound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought I was a retired middle school principal, but apparently I'm wrong. I must be a comedian. I say that because people describe this as a comedy because it has some humor in it. I tell an occasional joke, hence I must be a comedian.This is a comedy? Let's see. You have the leading man in love with two women -- sisters. One sister is depressed about her life, but is brought alive when she meets her sister's finance. The other sister is in love with the leading man, but wants him to conform to her father's staid view of what life in high places should be. The father is a relic from New York City's elite, which is becoming passé since the Great Depression; meanwhile he stifles both (but particularly one) daughters to the point that one is in a state of depression. The brother is an alcoholic. The romantic lead has to decide whether to let one sister and the father ruin his dreams for his life, or marry the depressed sister who understands his dreams. So much for this being a comedy.That's not to say there's not humor here. Cary Grant repeatedly doing acrobatic tricks (he had formerly been an acrobat), and Katherine Hepburn joining him. A genuinely funny performance by Edward Everett Horton and his movie wife -- Jean Dixon.Perhaps the reason that this did not succeed at the box office was that Columbia pegged it as a comedy, but that's not what audiences found after they paid for their tickets. Perhaps critics, who generally praised the film, released what the film really was. I, too, give this film high marks for standing above many films of the time. The characters come alive far more than they did in many other films of the general time period. Grant, Hepburn, Horton and Dixon are superb, and at the very least, the rest of the actors do their jobs.There are many Cary Grant comedies. If that's what you want, go elsewhere. But if you want to see several outstanding performances in roles that are rather compelling...yet with a charming mix of humor mixed in here and there, this is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great tale of burning love!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh, the enormous power of love and its ability to overcome any obstacle, no matter how big it can be. That's what happens in George Cukor's enjoyable comedy, packed with top-notch romantic feelings and delightfully joyful images. The sizzling romance between Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant can be felt in every scene they're in together and that's what makes this movie so stirring. It's a great tale about what it takes to find true love in a society full of people that try to bring us down. It is Cukor's fantastic take on a dysfunctional, rich family, where everybody seems to be unhappy, contrary to the first impression. Some would think that living in a big palace with tons of money makes you infinitely happy. However, as we look at the Seton family we realize that problems of any nature may occur in every household, no matter if privileged or not.When Johnny Case (Cary Grant), a regular hard working citizen, finds out that the woman he is going to marry is very wealthy he is absolutely glad, because he thinks that he would be finally able to fulfill his dream of taking time off from work and going on a (maybe never ending) holiday. Unfortunately, Julia's powerful and stubborn father slowly tears down his grand dreams. But to his aid come his fiancée's siblings ? troubled brother Ned (Lew Ayres) and sister Linda (Katherine Hepburn), who is always ready to bring a little bit of felicity into the family's dull appearance. You can feel an overwhelming passion coming out of Katherine Hepburn all the time and that's what really amazed me about her performance. She is really astounding as Linda Seton, girl so full of joy and always standing up for the good of a relationship she isn't supporting deep inside. She is a crown jewel in her snobbish family (definitely not a black sheep, as she claims in one scene), the person, who puts smiles on other people's faces. This is probably why Johnny is so quickly enchanted by her glamorous attitude towards life and love. Cary Grant is stunning as this delightful young man, with big hopes and dreams, a bit intimidated by the opulence he encountered. I admire his ability to play in such fantastic comedies, like this one, Bringing Up Baby or His Girl Friday. He has this amazing comedic touch, which always lets him act at the right moment, to bring out lots of laughs from the audience. The main plot reminds me a bit of You Can't Take It with You, a movie starring James Stewart. It also came out in 1938 and presents a similar clash of two totally different social classes and their struggle to overcome differences and let the young couple live happily together.This great tale of romance and passion creates a movie so charming and pleasurable that every classic comedy fan should watch it. Even though it's in a sense a story about unhappy love, in the end it shows that sometimes it takes a longer look to see what we have previously overlooked and make us realize that true happiness has been right around the corner all this time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant diversion...begins as a drawing-room comedy before revealing a more complicated undercurrent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Audiences in 1938 stayed away from this generally witty adaptation of Philip Barry's play about a 30-year-old 'self-made man' who plans to retire and be free from responsibilities (perhaps it was the hardships of the Depression that, by contrast, made the picture seem out-of-touch?). Cary Grant (with a thick head of black Brylcreem'd hair) performs amiably in the underwritten lead, discovering his fiancée is the daughter of a wealthy banker, a man who'd prefer his future son-in-law to go into business with him. Katharine Hepburn plays Grant's prospective sister-in-law, who finds herself drawn to his carefree nature despite all her resistance. Opens on a light, frivolous note, but becomes more substantial and interesting in its final third. George Cukor directed, allowing the characters room to blossom and change, although some of his asides (such as Hepburn's emotional visit to professor Edward Everett Horton's apartment, or the curiously dissatisfied nature of her embittered brother) stick out as odd concepts which don't quite come off. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Holiday as a fan of Cary Grant and of Katharine Hepburn, and like I did with Bringing Up Baby and The Philadephia Story, I loved it, from start to finish Holiday is quite simply magical entertainment. CINEMATOGRAPHY/PRODUCTION VALUES The cinematography for films made around this period, before and after and for this genre, often looks wonderful and holds up well. Holiday is no exception to the rule, while the costumes and sets add to Holiday's charm. MUSIC As an aspiring professional singer and music enthusiast I always look for good music. An uncredited Sidney Cutner provides the music here, and he does do a very good job. The music is memorable and fitting, and does have a somewhat timeless heart warming quality to it. STORY The story for Holiday is a very sweet and heart warming one. While things do get a tad overstated at the end, throughout George Cukor(who does a superb job directing this film) makes the story and situations upbeat and entertaining.SCREENPLAY Aside from the acting, the screenplay is what makes Holiday work so well, as it expertly mixes comedy, romance, social comment and pathos. The comedy is genuinely funny, the romance is sweet and warm, the social comment is relevant and done in a non-offensive way and the pathos is poignant. ACTING Holiday does have a superb support cast, with Doris Nolan, Edward Everett Horton and Lew Ayres particularly standing out. But for my money, the film's best asset is the performances and chemistry of the leads. Cary Grant is at his most charming and his most thoughtful, and I have yet to see a film of hers where Katharine Hepburn is as touching and as beautiful as she is here even playing the rich-girl character that we have seen before. And their chemistry sparkles like champagne bubbles. All in all, I think this film is wonderful. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

After the family introductions Cary Grant and his girlfriend's sister (Katherine Hepburn) gradually realize that they have more in common than Cary's original girlfriend.It's funny, it's about class ? as in rich and middle class, it's about breaking parental authority, it's witty and it's romantic of course. However the film starts to drain somewhat in the second half as the plot becomes overstated and saturated with too much repetitious dialogue ? mostly about Katherine trying to break from her domineering father and her rich heritage (poor her!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story behind the big names</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Holiday (1938) is a nice streamlined version of the previous version, worth watching for both the solid story and to catch a moment in the careers of two of Hollywood's greats during their heyday. The story involves a young man who wishes to marry a young woman, not knowing that her family is very wealthy. His dreams don't necessarily coincide with her family's sense of ambition, but it seems they are willing to work it out for the sake of love.This certainly isn't my favorite movie with Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn. There are two other obvious choices ahead of them, but I found this a nice surprise. They interact very well, very naturally, which probably shows the outstanding professionalism they both found easy. Due to the nature of the plot, there are subtle moments between the two which require a bit of care. George Cukor was handy enough at directing those moments and it seems he worked well with Cary and Kate.As the film begins, it seems that our two stars are not the lead, as Kate is the older sister of Cary's bride-to-be. This becomes a wrinkle that is written in small letters at first, as Kate's character of Linda Seton is very well written for the original play. Her interest in Cary's Johnny Case grows only to a point, as long as she sees him as her future brother-in-law. Even the moment they recognize what might have been is nothing tawdry. It is more of a hope of a close relation as "brother" and "sister."At times, this story reminded me of "Pride and Prejudice" with a lot of opposites in action. The man doesn't measure up to the girls station in life, and instead of the father simply wanting his daughter's happiness, this difference is an issue as he attempts to set up the couple for their future lifestyle, down to the Manhattan flat in which they will live.I watched the first version of this movie, from 1930, before watching this one. I haven't seen or read the original play, so I assume the lines in common between both movies are drawn straight from the source. These tend to be some of the best lines in both movies and really make a solid foundation for the performances. I found the treatment in this film to lean more toward the comical. Tastes had changed in 8 years, and although the original has its share of sharp humor, this version tends to play toward an audience that may miss the subtleties of a quick verbal exchange. This is underscored by the addition of Cary's tumbling. Granted, he worked as an acrobat before being found by Hollywood, and this is the only movie I've seen him use any true tumbling. However, it seemed almost like an add-on to show what Cary had that Robert Ames didn't. If the original play called for the tumbling, it seems like a trick to play during auditions. To complement Cary's skills that he brings, Kate can only bring a bit of overacting, which she does to good comic effect, true to the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Practically Perfect Romantic Comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Previously made in 1930, "Holiday" is an excellent version of the hit Philip Barry play. When easy going Johnny Case (Cary Grant) enters into the social world of Fifth Avenue socialite Julia Seton (Doris Nolan), he has no idea of what he is getting himself into. Having met at Lake Placid, he thinks she is a secretary at the five story mansion, and uses the servant's entrance to find her. He is escorted to an elevator which takes him to a room on the same floor and discovers the truth. He then meets her dipsomaniac brother Ned (Lew Ayres) and free-spirited sister Linda (Katharine Hepburn). At first, they seem to be a tight nit group of siblings, but then father Edward (Henry Kolker) comes along. Slightly domineering, dad puts Johnny through a tough questionnaire before giving his blessing. He breaks Linda's heart by taking over her plans of having a small New Year's Eve gathering and plans a huge party attended by most of New York society, including snooty relatives Henry Daniell and Binnie Barnes. From Johnny's world comes the Potters-Edward Everett Horton (repeating his role from stage and the 1930 RKO version) and Jean Dixon (not the psychic). They are as easy going and lovable as Daniell and Barnes are stick-in-the-muds. A minor recurring gag has the Potters constantly being referred to as "Porters". (This would be an ironic twist---a later Broadway musical version of "Holiday", called "Happy New Year!", used Cole Porter's old music.) As Kolker takes over Grant and Nolan's wedding plans, we also learn he has plans for Grant's future that don't sit well with his plans to take it easy for a while, learn about the world, himself, his dreams, and his own goals. Pending sister-in-law Hepburn of course is more Grant's equal, and slowly finds herself falling in love with Grant. She sits out the engagement party in the most comfortable room in the house, designed by her late mother to be at least one warm-hearted room in the huge white elephant mansion. There, she is joined by the Potters, Ned, and eventually Grant. When snooty Barnes and Daniell break in on the private party, they immediately cause tons of trouble, which results in a confrontation with Julia and her papa.What happens from here is presented more realistically and believable than most screwball romantic comedies of this era. This is more lighthearted screwball than most, certainly no "Bringing Up Baby", which paired Grant and Hepburn the same year. However, the brilliance of this film is in the realistic portrayals of the major characters. It is extremely understandable how Grant could find Nolan attractive. Away from her element, she was more easy going and likable than she became when around her domineering father. Her transformation from sweet socialite to potentially controlling spouse is remarkably true. Lew Ayres, then at the beginning of his "Dr. Kildare" fame, had long been a matinée idol, but here, in a supporting role, he gives a multi-dimensional performance as the son disgusted by his family, yet too weak to run away from it. Kolker, as the patriarch, isn't a monster father, yet is obviously so used to controlling everyone he wouldn't stop at trying that with a potential son-in-law. Dixon and Horton are amusing as Grant's long-time pals. It's easy to see how Hepburn's Linda could instantly fall under their spell, as well as Grant's. Hepburn and Grant had much chemistry as a screen couple, and it is a shame that they only made four movies together. They would have been a wonderful pairing in their later years; Unfortunately Grant retired right before the death of Hepburn's long-time partner Spencer Tracy.The fabulous art decco set of the Seton's mansion is beautiful to behold; The art direction was the only Oscar Nomination received for this wonderful film. But Hepburn was in danger of exile from Hollywood; Fortunately, another Philip Barry play ("The Philadelphia Story") would come her way and save her career. Fortunately, this film has become considered an all-time classic. Hopefully the 1930 version will pop up; I saw part of it a long time ago. Not as fast moving as this version, what I saw was still quite enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than a romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To classify this as simply a romantic comedy greatly undervalues and mischaracterizes it I think. Yes, the Grant-Hepburn chemistry is here in the story of Johnny Case (Grant), a man of modest means, who becomes engaged to Julia Seton (Doris Nolan), the daughter of a man of great wealth. The Seton home is so enormous that Johnny refers to it as a museum. Many complex themes are dealt with in this movie that are as relevant in 2006 as they were in 1938: the effects of wealth on families, the effects of disparate wealth distribution on social structure, personal freedom versus the pursuit of money and status, suppression of personal desires in respect for the desires of a sibling.Edward Seton (Julia's father) is a man so interested in social status and preserving the family name and wealth that he does not seem to have the slightest notion of the effect his passion to control has had on his family. Edward's son Ned (Lew Ayres) had a desire to be a musician but faced being cut off if he pursued that passion and, without the courage to take that risk, has become a cynical alcoholic living alone at home. Ned remains a tragic figure to the end. Julia is following in her father's footsteps, and her sister Linda (Hepburn) has the lively intelligence and self-knowledge enough to want out, but has reacted by retreating to live in the old childhood playroom - the only comfortable room in the house.The Seton's social circle consists primarily of wealthy stuffed shirts and social climbers. The big New Year's eve party where Julia's engagement to Johnny is announced is deadly. To escape the opprobrium meted out by the snobbish guests at that party, Johnny's friends, a university professor and his wife, wind up with Linda and Ned in the playroom. Later Johnny joins them and, at that moment, all of the sympathetic characters in the movie are in the same room.Introducing the rather free-spirited Johnny into the Seton family dynamic forms the basis for the story. Once you know the personalities involved I suppose it is a foregone conclusion what will happen, but there is more than enough to keep your attention along the way. I liked the fact that Johnny was not an idealistic ne'er-do-well, but rather ambitious with a decent job and good prospects. But, Johnny's plan was to make enough money so that he could take a break and determine just what was important in his life - an early version of the more recent idea of taking time off to "find yourself." But Johnny seems quite sincere in this goal, even though the idea of it is in severe conflict with Julia and old man Seton. However, Linda sees the value in it.Inevitably Linda falls for Johnny, but suppresses her desires in deference to her sister's. In the face of buckling to Julia's and Edward's expectations, Johnny ultimately recants the engagement, but not before we are led to fear that he is going to make the very bad decision of sticking with Julia. It is all too apparent that he is never going to fit in with the Seton family and their social circle.It would be interesting to know how this movie was received in 1938, nearing the end of the depression and at a time when there was an even more exaggerated disparity of wealth distribution.Hepburn is at the top of her form here - beautiful, stylish, literate. Seeing her walk down the long stairway to the party with such elegance is a joy and the scene with her standing on Grant's shoulders to do a synchronized tumbling act is a classic. The repartee we expect between Grant and Hepburn is a bit subdued, since they are not really allowed to be an item until toward the end. Lew Ayers is very good as the alcoholic son - so often playing a drunk is overdone, but Ayres plays it with just the right touch.They really don't make them like this anymore - what couple now has the magic charm of Grant and Hepburn? And, you gotta love those hats and those dresses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching comedy from Hollywood's "golden age"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A terrific romantic comedy, infused with near equal amounts of urbane sophistication and non-cloying sentiment. An exceptional adaptation of Phillip Barry's stage play (which had been filmed previously in 1930), director George Cukor and screenwriter David Ogden Stewart have succeeding in translating Barry's work to film while remaining true to the original source. In other words, the film remains faithful to its theatrical roots, but never feels static or stagy as many play-to-film adaptations often do. The film effectively depicts a clash between US materialism and individual ideology that was progressive for the day, and has lost none of its relevance or power today.The cast is flawless. Cary Grant is as engaging and charismatic here as anywhere else in his career, and Katharine Hepburn has seldom been more elegantly hypnotic as she is as the film's loveably unconventional heroine. The supporting cast is ever bit as impressive, with Edward Everett Horton, Jean Dixon, and especially Lew Ayres turning in delightful performances, and Doris Nolan, Henry Kolker, Binnie Barnes, Henry Daniell all delivering convincing portrayals of upper class snobbery. The performances, script, and direction all come together in this minor classic from Hollywood's golden age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The lighting in this movie is absolutely beautiful throughout the whole film. Certain parts were better than others though. I thought how the director really focused on the lighting was brilliant. You can tell extra attention was paid in each scene to make sure certain parts and people were lit up to really get the feel of the room. I *loved* all the diamonds that glowed so bright in the film. It really caught your eye. From the beginning I felt like Grant and Hepburn should have been together because their personalities were so similar, carefree and bright. I recognize the house in the film because its the same house from Gone with the Wind. There were so many scenes in this movie where I really thought about the dialog and took it into consideration for my own life. The main theme to this film is follow your heart no matter where it might take you. LOVED THE MOVIE! They don't call it classic's for no reason! Timeless movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a masterpiece but still outstanding enough to be one of the top 50 best films of all time.A romance comedy play that has incredible production and illustrates how to tell a tale through film despite limited settings.The great script is this films power,coupled with a great cast.Grant was the key here.The role was perfect for him.Nitpick?I would say that there were some lines that could heve been delivered slghtly better (re-taken) and also there were some moments that lacked energy at the wrong time.But still that is just plain nitpicking.This film towers over so many other efforts ever done.Second only to THE PHILADELPHIA STORY as the best all time romance comedy/drama play.Only for liberal minded fans of the genre (anti-Capitalism plot),and fans of the lead actors......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nothing special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of the movie moved along way too slow, and i was bored almost throughout the entire thing. Katharine Hepburn has yet to impress me, and this is just yet another film where i wish she was not a part of. Her character was too whiny and childish and to watch this movie was to suffer. This aside, she does have excellent chemistry with Cary Grant and they work very well together.I did, however, like the overall idea of the movie, being that an engaged man falls in love with the sister of his betrothed. the topic seems entirely taboo, maybe because i know if i even thought about one of my sisters men, past or present, the outcome would be catastrophic.Overall, there was nothing special or unique about this movie. it was kind of bland, not memorable, and i probably could've done without.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shades of "The Philadelphia Story"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>KATHARINE HEPBURN is a non-conformist in a family of stuffy socialites. Sound familiar? Once again she's a free spirit nobody can tame. CARY GRANT is a man who just can't seem to settle down or find his way in the world. A third person (Kate's snobbish sister) wants him if he conforms to her idea of marriage under the domineering thumb of her wealthy dad.It all plays rather well and moves at a nice pace, but if you've seen other Hepburn flicks (like THE PHILADELPHIA STORY), the outcome is predictable.Hepburn is fine in the quieter moments, showing sensitivity and grace, but in her big moments she becomes the actressy and overmannered actress of stage gestures.Grant is right at home as the nonchalant Johnny Case who wants to see more of life before settling down and letting himself be ruled by a family of stuffy socialites.The nice surprise in the whole mix is LEW AYRES as the brother who finds relief in the bottle and appears to be tipsy in just about every scene, giving a lighthearted imitation of a man under the influence.It's typical Philip Barry fluff and a little too much like the other play he wrote for Hepburn about socialites planning a wedding. If you're a Hepburn fan you'll like this. She looks radiant and appears to be having a fine time as the rebellious daughter.Nice supporting roles for Edward Everett Horton and Binnie Barnes. But it left me with a take it or leave it attitude toward it all. Maybe familiarity breeds contempt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is Cary Grant always so good? I don't understand it. Katharine Hepburn was great as usual, too. "You wouldn't care to step into a waltz as the old year ends, would you Mr. Case?" It's just poetry in motion. There were lots of strange yet good moments in the film. For example, when Grant did that strange somersault near the beginning of the film. What was that? It didn't make a sense but I rewound the tape a few times just to believe what I have seen. "Holiday" is actually the first George Cukor film that I have seen. I wasn't disappointed in the least. "Holiday" was a remake of a film that was only eight years its elder. That seems peculiar because the original is the only one that actually won awards. I greatly prefer the actors in the remake. I recommend this film to just about anybody who likes Cary Grant. So that means everybody I've ever known.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clash of the social classes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1938, Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn made two films together that are now universally held as classics. One is Bringing Up Baby, a whirlwind of a screwball comedy that follows the journey of a paleontologist and the wacky woman who loves him. In Holiday, directed by George Cukor, both performances are much more dumbed-down, but also more stimulating and gratifying. Grant plays Johnny Case, a young man with great success at his fingertips and a beautiful fiancé at his arm. He goes to meet her family and discovers there is really only one that shares his world-view, the fiancé's sister Linda (Hepburn).This film has been categorized as a romantic comedy. There is in fact, very little comedy although it is there. The real heart of this movie is in the performances of Grant and Hepburn and how they show the people closest to them that life cannot be lived to the fullest being too conservative. There is the typical "money can't buy happiness" talk, but there is also more to Grant's character in the way he tries to convince his future father-in-law that he wants a life much different than imagined despite he not being able to see it. As Grant and Hepburn realize their similarities there are touching moments all along the way. It can be a bit sad to see people not be able to look pas material possessions and ideas about being rich in order to accept people, but that is of course the message of this story.Despite only a handful of laughs, there is more heart and soul in this film than in any romantic comedy of the last 10 years. Cukor directs with such style and grace and we are swept up into this world of a clash of social classes and world-views. It is definitely a film that wouldn't be made today. But, that is part of what makes it so timeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Cukor's "Hoilday" starring like-minded Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant is a tale of chasing dreams. Linda Seton is the black sheep of a rich family that Johnny Case is about to marry into. Linda and Johnny are an obvious match made in heaven but Johnny is in love with Julia, Linda's sister. Johnny is all about chasing his dreams and feeling free and as the film goes on it is clear that all Julia wants to do is stand in his way. Johnny almost sells out for money instead of dreams but decides that he loves feeling free more than he loves Julia.Johnny and Linda bring out the best in one and other. Their free spirits run wild, hand in hand. Ned Seton and Linda also have a likable relationship and as a viewer, I could feel the connection between the two. I loved the honesty of these two characters when they'd exchange words. There was no tiptoeing around the issues when they spoke, they were sincere and straightforward. Ned also seemed to be a sort of obscure comic relief which I loved; he was my favorite character. This heartwarming story is filled with fast dialog; Hepburn and Grant deliver this very well and fed off of one and other making them so much fun to watch act.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very romantic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film because it was very sentimental and I find that I am a sap for a great love story. I saw Katherine Hepburn in "Bringing Up Baby" as well, and I have to say that I thought this role suited her better. I thought that she did a marvelous job; Cary Grant always does well. The design of the film really brought everything together. The clothes and the house really made you feel like you were there. The content of the film was in proper sequence and it was balanced nicely. The flow was similar to what you would see today if you were to watch a well-done romantic comedy. I think that the camera-work was clean, however there weren't any particular shots that stood out as excellent. The romance was very wholesome and that contributed to the verisimilitude of the film. It certainly leaves you with a great feeling about life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Case is an original man who has found love on a holiday at Lake Placid.The lucky girl he wants to marry is Julia Seton.But then he finds out she's rich.Her father Edward only cares about money and wants him to take a job in the bank.Her brother Ned drinks too much just to forget the miserable life with the money worshipping father.Then there is the sister, Linda, the black sheep of the family.She is more like Johnny, a free spirit who likes spending time in the play room upstairs instead of living with all the wealth downstairs.Linda is struggling with her feelings after she discovers she's in love with Johnny.George Cukor is the director of Holiday (1938).It's based on Philip Barry's play and it's a remake of the 1930 movie.Cary Grant is grand as the carefree Johnny Case.Katharine Hepburn is one of the kind as the unconventional Linda Seton.These two worked so great together, as we saw in Bringing Up Baby (1938).Lew Ayres is superb as Ned.You really feel for his character.Doris Nolan is great as Julia.And so is Henry Kolker as father Edward.Professor Nick Potter and his wife Susan Elliott are played by, in a brilliant way, by Edward Everett Horton and Jean Dixon.These two Johnny's friends are in the group of most lovable characters in the film.Binnie Barnes and Henry Daniell are very good as Mrs. Laura 'The Witch' Cram and Seton 'Dopey' Cram.Ann Doran plays Kitchen Maid.This is a movie about social differences.There is the wealthy class, and then there is the class Cary Grant represents.And it introduces us people who feel like they don't belong in their class.As a comedy this is top-notch.Cary Grant with his somersaults is hilarious.It's a lot of fun when the Potters (not the Porters) arrive at the engagement party on new year's eve.Nick loses his shoes for a while.And then when they find Linda's room- It's a ball! There you can find a trapeze, a puppet theater and everything else you can't find downstairs.This is what a romantic comedy should look like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The same year as Bringing Up Baby, and a few months later, the two leading male and female stars were back together for this great romantic comedy, from director George Cukor (The Philadelphia Story, My Fair Lady). Basically free-spirited John 'Johnny' Case (Cary Grant) is engaged to Julia Seton (Doris Nolan), daughter of a millionaire. Withthe exception of drunken Edward 'Ned' Seton (Lew Ayres) and Linda Seton (Katharine Hepburn), Julia's family want him to settle down to big business, but Johnny instead wants to spend his early years of his life on "holiday". With the help of his friends, Professor Nick (Edward Everett Horton) and Mrs. Susan Elliott Potter (Jean Dixon) he makes up his mind which is the better course, and as he is slowly falling for her, should he choose happiness with Linda, or stick with marrying the not to sure anymore Julia. He obviously made the right decision in the end when Julia drops him and the wedding, and Johnny goes on the cruise ship that Linda is travelling. Also starring Henry Kolker as Edward Seton, Binnie Barnes as Mrs. Laura 'The Witch' Cram and Henry Daniell as Seton 'Dopey' Cram. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction (the only award it was ever nominated for). Katharine Hepburn was number 38, and Cary Grant number 10 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Grant was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, Hepburn was number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and Grant was number 23, and Hepburn number 9 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!</fullReview>
