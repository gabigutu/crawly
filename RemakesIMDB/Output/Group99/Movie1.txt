		<shortDescription>No Thanks, I'll Take the Stairs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dutch director Dick Maas has essentially remade his own 1983 film De Lift with 2001's The Shaft (originally entitled Down), about an evil elevator system that suddenly begins killing people in a fancy-schmancy skyscraper. Artisan has shamelessly redesigned the cover art to resemble The Ring, and to highlight the presence of star Naomi Watts, though who that kid on the cover is supposed to be is really anyone's guess, because he is certainly not in the movie I watched.In between the dull investigative drivel, Maas delivers a few fun horror moments, including a spectacular elevator door decapitation and a fun bird's-eye P.O.V. of a character's leap off the observation deck. Maas even subjects an elevator full of very pregnant women to a terrifying ride.With the exception of a few establishing shots, it appears that much of The Shaft was shot in Europe, and the unconvincing "New Yawk" accents of most of the extras is definitely giggle-worthy. To Maas's credit, he has somehow managed to fill the film with a decent blend of familiar faces in supporting roles, including Edward Herrmann (the building manager), Dan Hedaya (a police lieutenant), Ron Perlman (the elevator repair company boss) and venerable bad guy Michael Ironside.There are brief moments of great fun in the murderous elevator flick, The Shaft, but too much time is spent talking and the dramatic payoff is a real eye-roller, even in B-movie horror terms. Artisan has supplied a solid 5.1 surround track, but the horribly cropped 1.33:1 fullframe transfer almost negates that.Yep, The Shaft has its ups and downs.6*(10* Rating System)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best 'Elevator Kills People' Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being completely disappointed with The Ool, my friends and I stuck in The Shaft only to be completely delighted (ouch, bad one). The Shaft (or Down,as it was apparently called at one point) follows the exploited elevator industry as the poor machines have to fight off babies and blind men and roller bladers.The Shaft is a perfect fit for anyone who wants some fun. I mean, look at that cast! It's B-movie heaven. Watching Ron Perlman's impassioned defense of the elevator industry is golden, and Naomi Watt's 'acting' is once again fun to watch. The pacing is the real villain in this flick, as it drags on with useless characters and stupid tangents when elevators killing people really should have been the sole focus of the movie. The climactic battle between the evil elevator which includes, yes, a rocket launcher that shoots invisible rockets, is golden. I will admit with little uncertainty, that this is simply the best Hedaya/Herrmann/Perlman/Ironside/Watts v. possessed elevator movie out there, and, for my money, was worth the fifty cent rental.Rating: 2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Viewers-It Brings You "Down" and Gives You "The Shaft"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Naomi Watts became a big star from her excellent performances in excellent films like "Huckabees", "Mulholland Drive", and "21 Grams"; she was delivering excellent performances in a lot of garbage movies like "The Shaft" aka "Down". And while her performance here does not save the movie, it does elevate (bad pun intended) it to a viewable level.The only other reason to watch this thing is to see yet another example of the film-making phenomenon that big is not only not better, but much worse. Which is probably related to the human interest angle in journalism, where a large disaster cannot sustain interest as long as the same story on a smaller more human scale.For those who don't already know it, "The Shaft" or "Down" is Dutch Director/Writer Dick Mass's remake of his 1983 classic "De Lift". One posted comment about the original says: "?. looks technically proficient, with fine color texture, smooth cinematography ( by Marc Felperlaan ) and tight editing ( by Hans van Dongen ), elements that help to maintain a high level of suspense. The story clearly echoes Jaws, with its obsessed hero and corrupted authority figures, who would rather disguise the truth than face it. Despite this movie being his debut, many of Maas's personal trademarks are also already in place: quick pacing, sadistic gore effects modified by edgy humor, mild satire on bourgeois preoccupations, and broadly etched supporting characters".Apparently the title "Elevator" was already taken and "Lift" was too European for the remake he was left with two very stupid titles with which the distributors have been experimenting since 2001.In the 1983 version, the elevator of an Amsterdam flat (another European term) misbehaves badly. The elevator begins trying to crush, suffocate and decapitate passengers. Fearless mechanic Felix does battle with the seemingly haunted machine. But the anti-technology twist is that the elevator has developed a mind of its own due to an experimental 'biochip'. Felix is assisted by a magazine reporter named Mieke de Beer ( wasn't that the name of Scotty's German pen pal in "Eurotrip"?).The original was shot in just 30 days with a very limited budget, this constrained the production resulting in an intimate story, viewers identified with the characters and this greatly enhanced the suspense level. This time someone gave Maas a lot of money and he pumped up the production; moving it to New York, adding tons of unnecessary effects, making the elevator absurdly powerful, and geometrically increasing the size of the cast. The Amsterdam elevator was deadly but in ways that a malfunctioning elevator could be deadly. The new elevator is like a cross between a James Bond story and a poor 1950's science fiction film.Not surprisingly the human interest wheels fall off immediately. If you ignore your strong impulse to bail and just keep watching you will see decent performances from Watts and the from various character actors who populate the cast.Unfortunately for Mass, he choose New York City for this 2001 movie and deviated from the original by throwing in some misdirection about terrorists being behind the elevator accidents. There is even a line about the first bombing of the World Trade Center. Apparently this was embarrassing enough to insure that there was no theatrical release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, people will probably bust up this movie, but it was really pretty good. It had a bit of a far fetched plot, but it was funny in places and the gore wasn't bad. The bit when the elevator chopped off the guy's head was a decent effect -- slow motion and relatively seamless. And the fact that they had references to terrorism in a NY skyscraper -- before 9/11 -- was pretty cool. Even made reference to the 93 attempt on the WTC and to Bin Laden -- a while before the actual event. Eerie. At least someone out there connected the dots. I'd rent it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of these "so-bad-it-is-good" movies. In the first half it's just boring, a badly done thriller. In the second the story (and acting and directing) gets so ridiculous i was laughing my balls off. Watch out for a "shocking" scene in which a hand has an important role. That must be one of the most creative scenes in film history. You'll know what I mean when you see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It all begins with a sweeping, awe-inspiring shot of The Millennium Building, one of New York City's premier hotels, housing all of 100-some odd floors. We zero in on two goombah bellboys spying on an old man and two old-looking women boinking in a highrise across the street; this scene brings to mind Brian De Palma's "Body Double," and the decent production values mixed with aforementioned homage give the viewer an (admittedly misleading) impression of what's to come. While fully aware of the (admittedly deserved) bad reputation most DTV efforts have, "The Shaft" at least starts off with promise. Writer-director Dick Maas (remaking his 1983 Dutch original, "The Lift") has a knack for framing scenes, building suspense, and keeping his camera firmly in the moment. The problem is, his script is a muddled misfire, never quite settling on a solid path; the result is an accidental bending of sci-fi, horror, and flat-out action that never gels as well as it should. After an elevator in the Millennium knocks off a bunch of victims in extravagant fashion, the plot devolves into a drawn out (and ultimately unsuccessful) search for The Truth--suddenly elevator repairman James Marshall (imagine a cut-rate Brad Pitt) and fetching reporter Naomi Watts (pre-"Mulholland Drive") are standing in for Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe, turning this into "El.A. Confidential." And in the final act, Maas spins the film into the outer limits of absurdity with a Michael Bay extravaganza of stunts and explosions, throwing in some references to Osama bin Laden and terrorism (pre-9/11!) for good measure. Save for Watts' lead role, most of the big names on the video box (including Ron Perelman, Dan Hedaya, Edward Herrmann, and Michael Ironside) are relegated to smaller 'guest appearances' (though every little bit helps). Big names aside, the premise is stretched so thin that you'll be hard-pressed to care about anything by the time the noisy climax rolls around. "The Shaft" takes a concept with genuine horror potential and transforms it into a bowl of cold oatmeal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm giving Down the thumbs up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It amazes me how often deliberately cheesy, tongue-in-cheek horror films are misconstrued as poorly made garbage. Down (AKA The Shaft), director Dick Maas' 2001 remake of his own 1983 Dutch horror De Lift, opens with the camera gliding gracefully over the NY skyline to eventually come to rest on 'The Millennium Building' where two night watchmen use an observation telescope to spy on big-breasted hookers at work in a neighbouring skyscraper; it's a superbly executed and wonderfully trashy opening that should make it crystal clear that Maas knows exactly what he is doing?making a highly entertaining, campy schlock/horror that shouldn't be taken seriously?and yet there are still those who seem to have missed the joke.Oh well, it's their loss, because when viewed as intended, Down proves to be a lot of fun, packed as it is with outrageously silly deaths, delightfully daft dialogue, and knowingly clichéd characters?precisely the kind of stuff I would expect to see in a horror film about a murderous 'living' elevator controlled by a malevolent state-of-the-art computer chip enhanced by living brain tissue.An excellent cast clearly have a blast in their two-dimensional stock roles, with a gorgeous pre-A-list Naomi Watts as a feisty newspaper reporter, James Marshall as a cocky elevator engineer, Ron 'Hellboy' Perlman as the shady owner of the elevator company, Dan Hedaya as a grizzled NY detective, and Michael 'Scanners' Ironside as a loathsome scientist hellbent on perfecting his pet project, whatever the cost. Maas keeps the action moving along at a brisk pace, handling the special effects set-pieces, wry humour, and gruesome shocks with confidence, even going so far as to kill off women, children, and animals along the way.And if all that isn't enough to pique your interest, let's not forget about the eerily prophetic scene in which characters discuss the possible use of a plane in a terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre; with 9/11 just around the corner, it stands out as a genuinely chilling moment in an otherwise intentionally ridiculous and wonderfully OTT piece of nonsense.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satirical horror film and a good example of a decent American remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in the US as The Shaft, this is Dick Maas remake of his own striking debut. 1983's The Lift was a blackly comic chiller about a skyscraper's lift that begins to take the lives of its occupants. This beefed up version keeps the original premise intact, right down to the odd bio-mechanical explanation, but takes place in New York City, pre- 9/11. Beginning with an extravagant pan through the Manhattan skyline and onto the observation deck of the CG rendered Millennium Building, Maas's film looks ever bit as stylish as its $15 million budget would suggest. Given its blockbuster production values its easy to take this absurd movie at face value, but those familiar with the original may recognise that Maas is actually attempting deadpan parody. Slickly directed in widescreen frame, Marc Felperlaan's cinematography complements both the city (which was used only for exterior shots) and the gorgeous art deco production design of the building itself. James Marshall, as the rugged young hero, has something of Christian Slater, Mark Whalberg or Josh Hartnett about him, while his love interest is none other than Naomi Watts, who shortly after became a star in another US-set remake of a foreign classic. In this and that other film she plays a reporter investigating an absurd concept, here a killer lift, there killer videotapes. They are supported by respectable cast of character actors Michael Ironside, Edward Herrman, Ron Perlman and Dan Hedaya. Kicking off the scene with the sounds of Aerosmith's Love in an Elevator, an extravagant race takes place between two incredibly skilled risk takers through New York traffic and into the basement parking garage of the Millennium Building. One of the skaters is then sucked into the lift, in an unexplained supernatural moment, only to be thrown out from the top floor. Bold, inventive and darkly humorous, this brief sequence, which has no dialogue or featured performers present, displays Maas' talent with his rehashed material to the greatest effect. This film was, unfortunately, somewhat prophetic and is laced with unintended irony as a result. Released over two years after the destructive assault on the World Trade Centre, it's not difficult to see why. The very first shot shows us those twin towers, which will forever provoke gasps of remembrance in whatever film they appear, and soon we are in a similar building where horrifying acts are occurring. This seems at first a rather tenuous reason to delay a release, but then the moment arrives when the narrative enlists comments from the fictional President, in which he expresses fear of the occurrences as a terrorist act. This remake is something of a cross between its inspirational text and the likes of high-rise horror's Poltergeist 3 (Gary Sherman, 1988) and The Tower (Richard Kletter, 1993), and is certainly superior in the execution of its novel concept than either The Mangler (Tobe Hooper, 1994) or sequels. The only thing that really lets this film down is the bad language. The F-word is used gratuitously and repeatedly throughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can be said about this film? The character development is flawless, the writing and directing on par with Citizen Kane, and performances that leave one breathless. Particularly, Michael Ironside, who follows up his performance in Starship Troopers with this masterpiece. Not since his played the ruthless Richter in Total Recall has Ironside left his audience so convinced of his villainy. Not to mention Ron Perlman's heart warming defense of the elevator industry which only leaves tears in ones eyes. Bravo to Dick Maas for conjuring up such an original storyline that is clearly on par with other amazing movies. Sidekicks, Top Dog, Jingle All the Way, all need to move over and make way for as the number one film in all of our hearts. See this movie and you will be left with a euphoria that is indescribable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a typical Dick Maas production. Cheesy to the max, limited plot, laughable dialogue and comic action sequences. Anyone who has seen anything by Maas will recognise these as his trademark and just go with the flow. I was dreading watching this movie from all the comments on IMDB but while it is hardly a classic (it's pretty poor really), it IS very entertaining. It's a real no brainer that passes the time quite nicely and while artistically his original "De Lift" is a better movie, I found this one to be more entertaining. Score out of 10? 5/10 for the film itself, 7.5/10 for entertainment value. PS~ Forgot to mention the acting.... probably for the best ;-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Scary and Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Down", (A.K.A. The Shaft) was both funny and scary,and a delightful surprise. I caught this movie completely by accident on TV and it had me glued from the first few minutes. So glued that I ended up buying a copy less than a day later. It's THAT good. In a way it was a throwback to the 80's with cheesy dialog, characters, and implausible situations.Good old New York City has a very nice building called The Millennium Building, one of the most impressive views of the city and killer elevators...LITERALLY. Seems that these elevators have more than your typical "exceeds maximum weight" problems. This elevator does some VERY NASTY THINGS. How nasty? Very very VERY NASTY THINGS.Without revealing too much, my favorite scene had to do with Edward Herrmann, having just seen something so disturbing that he's crawling on his hands and knees. As he's doing this, a young lady is walking by, not tripping on this, says hi to him before SHE sees what he saw.Or was it the skateboarder? Or the pregnant women? Or the bad acting, script and direction? It's just a hoot to watch! It's bad and good, like a big piece of chocolate mousse pie in front a person on a diet. You know you shouldn't bite into it, but you can't help it.Naomi Watts (Before "The Ring" pulled her up a bit), Michael Ironside (And what is it with him and elevators? Remember him as Richter in "Total Recall?"), and even Ron Perlman (I would love to have a boss like him!)walk through this land of cheese and pretty much survive this experience.This is a good film to watch on a Saturday night, with beer and pizza. Enjoy a big hunk of cheese.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My take on this film is that it is a good B movie, or a very good C movie. Come on people, it's time to suspend disbelief. The acting wasn't bad, Ron Perlman and Michael Ironside were in it, and of course there's the Naomi Watts eye candy element. And who doesn't enjoy seeing people get sliced in half by elevators, or well, who hasn't secretly feared being sliced in half by an elevator? Not going to win any Oscars, but hey, considering some of the dreck that comes out of Hollywood, this was pretty refreshingly bad. Of course it gets silly at the end, the bio-computer story line was completely inane. It's a classic B movie, and mostly because of the fact that it made so many creepy 9/11 predictions. Suspend disbelief, kick back, enjoy.</fullReview>

Among the deahts, Bild guy falls down the shaft (can you dig it?) security guard gets decapitated by a elevator car, skateboarder plunges to his death from the 92nd floor, gut gets cut in half by the elevator car, floor drops out, making everyone fall to their death, and the cables strangle th bad guy.\ The eeriest thin g about the movie is that there's a scene in it where the president comes on stating there was a terrorist attack in the building -- And this movie was released a few months before 9 /11 Also, there's a fake "gotcha" moment near the end that was actually pretty clever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie has no right to be this entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I stumbled upon "The Shaft" while flipping through the cable channels. The TV guide had it listed as the 2000 Samuel L. Jackson version of "Shaft", which I had not yet seen. My first thought was that the film was off to a bad start by the mistitled "The Shaft"--it became clear rather soon that this was not the same film as I was led to believe. Jackson was nowhere in sight, instead replaced by an as-yet-unknown Naomi Watts.And yet, I sat there for the entire film, cheering and laughing and applauding what I think must be one of the most absurd B-movies I've ever seen. The production values are surprisingly strong, with good cinematography, decent (to a point) visual effects, and some obviously tongue-in-cheek acting from the unusually stocked cast (Naomi Watts, Ron Perlman, Dan Hedaya?). I almost get the feeling that this film was shelved from theatrical release upon the 9/11 attacks (the screenplay contains some very eerie and prescient references to the not-yet-committed terrorist attacks on the WTC towers and Osama bin Laden).However, with all that said, "The Shaft" is one insanely enjoyable ride through B-movie territory. What do you expect from a movie whose villain is a possessed self-aware elevator? To be sure, this is far superior to "The Mangler", another film about a killer machine gone haywire. This one never takes itself seriously, in spite of the rather frightening effects of people being decapitated (a most impressive effect) and others falling to their deaths. No one is spared: pregnant women, children, dogs. This elevator is one mean SOB.Yet the filmmakers know exactly what tone to take, mixing dark comedy with the macabre to make what I can say is one of the more entertaining films I've seen in a while. From a masochistic German daycare worker (played riotously over the top) to an obnoxious blind man and his seeing-eye dog (whose ends are both laughable and sad simultaneously), this film does almost everything right--that is, up until the conclusion. The story takes an awkward turn into military cover-ups and corporate greed which drags the story into unnecessary territory. What should have been a fast-paced climax is more complicated than it should be and more serious than it demands.That said, "The Shaft" is one of those movies which screams to be watched with friends, laughed at with a beer in one hand and a shot in the other. This is one odd-ball feature film, both very funny and shocking. Not a great film by any stretch of the imagination, but one that will stick in my memory for a while to come. Definitely worth a look if you are in the mood for what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>when was this made, exactly...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a remake, and director Dick Maas' also directed the original De Lift, a somewhat better and certainly smaller-budgeted movie. This one is somewhat curious in how it has a sort of trial run for Naomi Watts' character in The Ring (the American remake), a lot of sexual and sexist language which contrasts weirdly with an article Watts' character is working on (or plagiarizing), and the weird ways it seems to reference the 9/11 attacks. Some of the dialogue might have been added afterward. I wonder if anyone knows?I wouldn't recommend reading this unless you've already seen the movie, or have no intention of ever seeing the movie. However, my comments don't address what the elevators are doing or why, so it doesn't spoil that central concept.The movie is centered around the 102 story (fictional) Millennium Building in NYC, a skyscraper with 73 elevators (so the opening title card tells us). After some mishaps involving one of the elevators, we meet Naomi Watt's character Jennifer. As in The Ring, which she later starred in, she is a journalist. She's working on an article "about the struggle for women's voting rights" for her paper the Morning Post titled "The Right to Vote: Women's Most Radical Demand." Though not addressed in the movie, the title and the first two paragraphs (the only ones we see) are taken from the "Introduction to the Woman's Suffrage Movement" in the "In Depth Tour" in the "Cyber Museum" at the National Women's History Museum website. The text is on screen for a moment, then garbled as a computer virus strikes, and she calls her co- worker Chip over for help. He'd unsuccessfully asked her out before. "Nice warm seat," he says, sitting down. "It's the closest you'll get" she replies, leaning in and smiling. Her boss wants her to get her "pretty little (rear end)" over to the Millennium building, arguing that the current story is a "bit after the fact, isn't it?" When he demands that the story be juicy, she says (once he's left) "I'll (urinate) on them."Mark, an elevator technician, first encounters the reporter at one of the problem elevators, where she's pretending to be a janitor in order to get into the crime scene. He doesn't want to talk to her, and as the police start escorting her away, she tries to stay by first claiming to be with Mark, then that they were talking, then, bizarrely, that he raped her! Much later in the movie she cries wolf again in a bizarre way, saying "Look out! Libyans!" to policemen escorting her who do believe there is a terrorist threat.After having investigated the problem elevator Jeff says, "it's like airplanes going down and no one ever finds out why." This is the first of a number of weird ways this film seems to reference 9/11 though apparently predating it (much more so later). Jeff increasingly seems a little careless, and Mark the more responsible one.Mark is at his apartment investigating blueprints, and nervously answers the door with the handiest weapon he can find. "Wow," smirks Jennifer, "big bat!" They flirt a lot, but in a fairly hostile way. She produces a videotape, saying "you like movies?" "Only X-rated, baby!" he replies. This scene is sort of weird, prefiguring The Ring, in which she has a male friend watch a sinister tape. The one here is security camera footage from the Millennium Building of one of the people who died after an encounter with one of the elevators. "I'm not into the whole kinky thing, I don't like seeing people killed on tape."After a particularly crazy elevator instance in which it nearly makes like the one in Willy Wonka, the President of the United States holds a press conference. He looks sort of like a guy from the beginning of the movie who was seen with the strippers at the beginning, but I'm not sure. His speech: "Fellow Americans, this afternoon, one of this nation's most famous and prestigious landmarks, the Millennium Building, was the scene of a vile and malevolent act of terror. I assure the American people that we will not rest, until those responsible for this cruel act are tracked down, apprehended, and convicted. We have already taken decisive measures to prevent a recurrence of these events. FBI investigators are on the scene, working closely with the New York Police Department. During their investigation, the building, and surrounding area, will be sealed off to the public." This is followed by a shot of the World Trade Center towers at night, and the President continues in voice-over, "Our sympathy goes to the families of those deceased. It is events of this sort that test the mettle of the American people." The camera moves into a car parked across the river from the Trade Center, where two people have apparently been listening to the address on the radio, and discuss the events at the Millennium Building. Says one of them, "chaos, the whole city, the whole country in total turmoil?"As the building is surrounded by the NYC Police Emergency Service, some of whom are unloading weapons from a truck, we have this exchange: "Stingers?" "Terrorists have airplanes too." "Ah, you don't believe that (excrement) now, do you?" "The President does!"A moment later, they continue: "I think this whole thing is blown out of proportion." "Well, they almost got the Twin Towers ten years ago." And shortly thereafter, "if you see Bin Laden, say hello!"End credits have thanks to the New York City Mayor's Office for Film, Theater and Broadcasting, and to the New York City Police Department Movie Unit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anti-social elevator needs anger management counseling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "Millennium" building (which looks suspiciously like the Empire State Building) has an elevator that likes to get rid of riders -- the express way, if you know what I mean.The how's and why's of the attacks are only hinted at with a few scattered morsels of information. Most of the time, it's just a parade of people approaching the elevator; some die (in some very gory ways), others don't. There is some suggestion that the victims are evil in some way, but even that isn't consistent. Management tries to ignore the problem, as always. The elevator wraith, or whatever it is, has only so many ways it can do its evil deeds, so it utilizes as much variety in its repertoire of kills to entertain itself as it can. The movie usually tries to hope the tension of nearby potential victims is enough.One irony to note: This was Naomi Watts lesser-known monster encounter in this building: she would be climbing around the outside with a giant ape amidst a hail of bullets a few years later.The movie squeezes out the most it can from the premise, and is mildly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This gets 2 stars instead of 1 because the production values were surprisingly good for such an otherwise poorly made movie. Terrible dialogue and plotting, and a story that...well, you just wonder why anyone put the amount of money into this movie it obviously took to produce it.Several named actors (Dan Hedeya, Ron Pearlman, Edward Herman) try manfully in their scenes to make the wordy dialogue work, as does a then little known Naomi Watts. I'd say I feel sorry for Ms. Watts, having to take roles like this while her best friend (Nicole Kidman) is doing Moulin Rouge! and other top films, but fortunately Naomi more than landed on her feet a year later with Mulholland Dr., which made her a star. We all have to pay our dues, I guess - this was part of Watts', and even Kidman had BMX Bandits in her past...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesomely Sick! Contains SPOILERS Dude!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes a film can totally take the viewer by surprise and deliver a standard of entertainment one thought was only possible in dreams. Yes, I am talking about "The Shaft", also known simply and dramatically as "Down", quite a clever title when we consider the function of the elevator that is central to the film's storyline? but let's not forget that elevator's can also bring us back "Up" again and one wonders if that title hadn't been used for a Russ Meyer soft-core sex-romp whether that name would have better described the pure elation one feels when viewing a film like this one.The film is set in New York in a giant skyscraper. I think I would enjoy visiting New York as it looks much like my hometown of Sydney. The entrance to the skyscraper looks just like Martin Place, the street it's on looks just like George Street and everybody in New York has Australian accents. Something tells me this movie was not actually shot in the city that never sleeps. Never mind, who will ever know? Right? The first scene in the elevator is a real hoot. There's like these 7 pregnant chicks in the elevator, right? They are totally knocked up, buns in the oven, Preggos as all hell. Anyway, you wouldn't read about it but the elevator gets stuck between falls. So I'm thinking "Awesome! I hope this turns into a movie about a 7-way pregnant-lesbian-elevator-orgy." But this is where the movie twists? Almost immediately two of the broads go into labor, right? There's screaming, and suffocation and placenta everywhere when the elevator finally reaches it's destination and opens up on some unsuspecting Australian Americans.Now for some reason the elevator gets really p-ssed, maybe because they couldn't scrub the afterbirth off the carpet? I don't know,I'm open for suggestions here? but it gets real mad and starts killing random people. Like the blind guy who likes to grope his hair dresser Shazza, he's really a dirty old lecher so she dies his hair green to get even with him. But get this, because he's so firkin blind he can't tell his hair is the color of pea-soup. Lol! And then him and his guide dog actually walk into the elevator shaft and there's no elevator there and they totally plummet to the death. Rotfl! Okay, so you are probably thinking "How can an elevator get mad? Elevator's don't get mad, they don't have feelings, they don't have brains!" But that's what I love about good science-fiction they have answers for everything. So, there's this German professor who got kicked out of the military for experimenting on computers made out of dolphin brains, and now he works at the elevator company and has built an evil elevator with a giant brain for a computer that gets really emotional and likes to kill Australian Americans living in New York. Now that's called artificial intelligence, man? Just think one day a giant computer with a dolphin's brain could write a movie like this. Sick! Awesome cast. Naomi Watts, she's an Aussie like me, actually I knew her when I was a kid? she lived around the block and we used to hunt koala bears together. Although these days we know that koalas aren't really bears at all. Ron Perlman plays the head of the Elevator company, remember he was really cool as Vincent the guy who lived in the sewers and had a lion-face in that old show "Beauty And The Beast". Oh, and Michael Ironside is the German scientist, he was in Scanners. For the uninitiated, Scanners was the movie that popularized the "exploding-head" genre of film-making.Did I mention the witty script? Sometimes I forget the important stuff but there is great dialog throughout. When journalist Naomi is told to make her elevator stories "juicy" by the newspaper's editor she replies "I'll pee on them". That's funny, that's just like something I would said. When he discovers the computer has the ability to reproduce one character exclaims "Machines and computers do not reproduce. Have you ever seen two chips f--king?" When Naomi falsely accuses an elevator mechanic of raping her the cop turns to the mechanic and says "Wow, You've got taste." Gold! When one mechanic doubts the suicide of the blind man the other confirms "Why not? I would, if I had green hair".Action abounds including severed torsos and even a beheading just like they used to do in the eighties. The special effects were way ahead of their time, remember this movie was made 5 years ago and blue-screening technology was in it's infancy so you may have to squint a little to make it look authentic. Oh yeah, there's this awesome roller-blading scene, if you don't know what roller-blading is you may have to ask your parents if they remember the nineties? that reminds me of this cool joke my girlfriend Wiz told me? "What's the hardest part of roller-blading? Telling your parents you're gay!" Ha ha ha.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An elevator that kills people. What's not to like?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever briefly get stuck in an elevator thats messing with you, malfunctioning and seems to almost have a mischievous mind of its own? That's the premise of Down, also known as The Shaft. It concerns an elevator in a huge residential/office building that has gone homicidally haywire. It traps, drops and tricks people no end, raising and lowering the interior temperature to dangerous effect and generally just being a great big meanie. No one seems so know what's going on with it though, especially the mechanic who installed it (Twin Peak's James Marshall). The incidents accumulate, attracting a perky tabloid reporter (Naomi Watts having a ball) who makes up all kinds of tall tales to explain the situation in sensationalistic terms. This infuriates the CEO of the elevator company (now there's a job title) played by a snarky Ron Perlman who gets a rant towards Marshall that walked in from a way better script (which leads me to believe it was the spawn of Perlman's legendary improv skills). There's also a cop played by Dan Hedeya who can't seem to figure it out wither. The truth is a lot more interesting than you might expect and has nothing to do with ghosts or spirits at all, but centers around a deranged research scientist (Michael Ironside, whacked out to kingdom come). It's not the least bit scary, but it's worth a watch simply for the fact that it's a movie about a damn elevator that kills people lol. Cujo and Christine ain't got nothing on this bitch. The scene where a gaggle of pregnant ladies enter the thing is just priceless in its blatantly gross out manner. Fun, fun stuff and great research to embarrass Watts with sometime down the road if you ever find yourself interviewing her on the red carpet hehe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be honest: I really just want to belt this one out. I have two more reviews to write and spending any amount of time on The Shaft (and not the good one) is too much time.ATTENTION: THE MOVIE IS ABOUT A KILLER ELEVATOR (or "shaft" or "lift.") Surprisingly, I've now seen three "killer elevator" movies: The Lift, Devil and now The Shaft. Believe it or not, it's better than Devil but a few floors down from The Lift ? from what I can remember. It's been awhile and damned Netflix doesn't have The Lift so I can't revisit that shaky climb.So?I guess they're playing on people's claustrophobic fears of an elevator because, quite frankly, the idea behind the three films (three? Really?) is rather dumb. It seems a lot safer to avoid stepping into an elevator than the ocean, as JAWS 2 warns you.Beyond the obvious problems with this feature of a NYC high rise that has a touristy elevator with an attitude, such as terrible acting, laughable dialogue and a sad list of great (Watts) to good (Perlman) actors who should know better?is the length. I mean, really? This is a B-movie, it doesn't pretend to be anything but?and still they thought 111 minutes (when 80-85 would do just fine) was what they needed to tell their story of a, and I repeat: KILLER ELEVATOR?Okay, honestly, it's not the worst movie I've seen, or even the worst B-movie, and I have seen plenty. But, it's still far too long with just awful acting, namely the lead: Marshall as no-good-trying-better elevator repairman, Mark Newman. Also, though some (just a bit) of the "kills" the shaft produces are creative, most are just painfully obvious?for someone who can think of what goes through the mind of a KILLER ELEVATOR.There really is no point of going over the plot?but just to make it quick: It's profitable to keep the beaches (sorry, still on JAWS 2) I mean, one of MANY elevators open, even though there's been some mysterious deaths (and births?don't ask.) New-comer repairman Mark teams up with "smart, sexy and obviously in it for the money" Watts as Jennifer Evans to crack the case of the satanic shaft.It's not at the point of "so-bad-it's-good" but it's worth watching if you're on something. In which I wasn't. Honest. I thought this might be a good substitute to Netflix not having The Lift. I was wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent entry, if not overtly spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shaft" is a decent affair, but it's nothing all that special.**SPOILERS**Lightning strikes the Millennium Building in New York, and elevator specialists Mark Newman, (James Marshall) and Jeffrey, (Eric Thal) are called in to investigate after an accident on-board which none of the building's crews can figure out. After checking it out and giving it the all-clear, more accidents continue to plague the building. Reporter Jennifer Evans, (Naomi Watts) catches on that something isn't right, but no one is willing to say. After she and Mark do some investigating on the story, they come up with a possible reason for the killings involved. Together, they try to piece what went wrong and save the people inside.The Good News: There wasn't all that much to like about it, but what was there was enough to like. The gore is pretty plentiful and has some cool deaths. There is a great decapitation done in slow motion, several falling down a shaft onto a series of spikes, and a quite brutal slicing in half by a fiery piece of debris. There's some other great deaths in here. The action scenes that comes in later in the film are quite well filmed and are actually quite interesting. They never really lose interest and make the final act a real saving grace for the film and makes up for the pretty slow beginning. The premise to this is actually kind of interesting and original, and is certainly what is needed to get the genre interesting again. It's not the cleverest one, but it is a new one, and that is what is needed quite badly.The Bad News: There is one thing about this movie that really drags it down a notch. The film follows a constant cycle of killing someone off, conducting an investigation only to find an accident, then repeating ad nauseam. It gets frustrating as it keeps happening, and we know that something is wrong and it should be an easy find for those involved, yet it continues to be an unknown factor to the authorities. It's pretty discouraging. Another factor that really didn't sit too well as the fact that there are at least three different explanations given for the cause of the accidents, and all three have their evidence to back them up, but it just seems like a bunch of different reasons culled together to be the official explanation and no one was willing to part with any of them, so they were just mixed in at different points along the way. It would've been much easier to just pick one of them and stick with it. For such a cool premise, there is little to no real tension in the film. There was no real moment that really was all that suspenseful over anything else. This really needed some scenes of tension to get a sense of fear towards the elevator.The Final Verdict: With a little more work fixing the screenplay, this could work, but as it is, it's too much of a disappointment. It could be worthwhile if you're looking for something similar, but if not then this is something to be ignored.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Full Nudity and a scene with a child in danger</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My rating of this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just happened to be in Blockbuster Video on August 14, 2004, looking for some good horror movies. I just happened to find "The Shaft" (or "Down", whatever you want to call it). As I read the summary, I decided to rent the disc, since I do not see very much action in movies involving elevators (other than the movie "Speed"). As I became more familiar with the characters and as the movie progressed, my first impression was that some evil spirit was haunting the elevator. I was really biting my nails when those pregnant women were trying to get out of the elevator. I later saw the blind man and his dog fall to their deaths in the shaft, the other get decapitated by the elevator, the skater going in and out of the elevator with the White Light (which made me believe some supernatural force was controlling the elevator), the little girl playing with the doors and WORSE - the many people that fell through the elevator's floor. You see, I HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN TRAPPED in an elevator, and that's exactly what it makes you do - do Number One in your pants. It's a terrifying situation I would not recommend to any one. I still believed it was demons at work until I viewed the scene where that German scientist and the MB's (Millennium Building) owner/manager had that secret meeting in their vehicles at a secret place. They were discussing the fact that the scientist needed to dismantle a mysterious invention that he had created to operate the elevators, since it was killing people. The elevator mechanic, journalist and that other guy were talking about this weird stuff earlier, which is supposed to be a biomechanism - which runs and operates like a machine of iron and steel, but thinks, feeds, grows and reproduces like a living thing (sounds almost like "Batteries Not Included", doesn't it?).After observing all of this, I became more anxious to see what the heck was controlling those elevators. After, seeing the elevator mechanic go through several passageways, ups and downs, I finally got my answer as he opened that compartment and showed us that stationary "mechanical lifeform" with a lava-like glow. It was interesting to see him try to stab that thing to death (laugh). He goes through some more drama but manages to blow the thing away with a bazooka. Overall, I gave this movie C+. It was good in bringing some elevator action to the table, which is rare, and the drama was excellent. The press conferences and investigations made it exciting also. However, biomechanics/biocomputers are LIGHT YEARS away from us right now, considering the fact that we don't even have have regular iron and steel computers with INDEPENDENT artificial intelligence, like HAL ("2001: A Space Odyssey"), JOSHUA ("WARGAMES") and SKYNET ("Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"). Besides, who would want a machine anyway that could possibly feel physical or emotional pain while doing all the hard and heavy work? Also, I would have been content with the City Mayor, not the United States President, to handle the problem with these elevators. (When that plane crashed in the Hudson several years back killing everyone on board, did the President even speak on that? No, just Mayor Guiliani.) However, something about the presence of the local SWAT teams made it real interesting though. Anyway, that's my opinion of the film for now. Goodbye.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What horror? This movie's not even about a haunted lift. There's no ghost or poltergeist at work. Its about a mad scientist who experiments with computer chips &amp; something screws up &amp; you have an elevator with a mind of its own. I'm sure a haunted lift would be more exciting. After all I think we're quite sick of movies about machines coming alive. Not a very interesting movie &amp; a tad unrealistic at times. Why on earth is the police the one setting up stinger missles? Isn't that the army's job? And how come the police even have stinger missiles in the first place? And why would the police place stinger missiles all over the building &amp; then leave them unattended to? Doesn't make any sense at all!But at least Naomi Watts was in it, so that's a positive thing. Must say she looks a lot hotter here than in The Ring. Boring story line but at least the babe makes it not a total loss!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An elevator shaft, seemingly possessed by a malevolent force, is behind a string of violent attacks on innocents hitching a ride inside the prestigious American landmark Millennium building in New York City. Pleasant elevator repairman, Mark(James Marshall), always having the same troubles holding employment, is basically holding this current job thanks to pal Jeff(Eric Thal). Unfortunately, Mark comes across newspaper reporter Jennifer Evans(a pre-stardom Naomi Watts, who is horribly dressed in this film..it had to be some sort of gag)who misquotes him risking his job and causing the police to label him as a possible suspect behind the evil elevator's malfunction. Mark finds that his friend, and colleague, Jeff had a friend who died tragically..Jeff is also seen speaking with a lab-coated scientist named Steinberg(Michale Ironside)who was canned from a failed military project concerning bio-chip technology fused with the genetics of dolphins. The idea that you can cross computer technology with real living tissue could lead to quite a handsome profit. Could this be the cause of the shaft's going berserk? Joining forces with Jennifer, who shows him a collection of cataloged recordings showing that the supposed suicidal ride of a rollerblader being pulled into and thrown out of the wicked shaft was merely a matter of seconds, Mark will seek to find the truth. When Jeff turns up dead, and it seems a cover-up is taking place labeling him a deranged terrorist, Mark will be extra-motivated in discovering the truth regarding the elevator and how to stop it. The question is will Steinberg, who is passionate about his life-s work, let Mark destroy the evil causing the shaft to kill?A great cast squandered in this perfectly dreadful horror-comedy where it's clear from the get-go the director is winking at you that this hunk of waste is supposed to be giggled at as a tongue-in-cheek parody. If only it were entertaining or funny, but alas it isn't. Loaded with profanity, the film has an ugly streak amongst it's supposed good-natured humor. A B-movie failure that was a chore to sit through. It only has some gory bits, and that cast, going for it. Ron Pearlman is wasted as the head of Meteor Elevator Repair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shockingly The Shaft (or Down as it's referred to on here as) turned out to be rather enjoyable. I mean I love Horror films but a killer elevator sounded like a stretch but when I first saw the DVD box art I knew I had to see it. Sure there were trying to cash in on Naomi Watts' success with The Ring and I won't even pretend The Shaft (Down) was anywhere near the ball park of The Ring but it turned out to be funny and entertaining and a little campy but with surprisingly good special effects, decent acting, and a unique original story line. Dutch director and writer Dick Maas writes and directs a remake of his own foreign film "The Lift" (1983) Maas creates a New York's biggest and most prestigious Landmark, the Millennium Building. Kudos to Maas for coming up with this original idea and giving the building a retro style feel and look, the whole building seems very ominous. The film is chock full of action and suspense, gore and enough bad language to make Al Pacino go red. The bad language is overblown and probably because Maas felt that is what the American horror film is all about and he's not entirely wrong but the amount of times they swear is phenomenal.Let's talk Miss Naomi Watts. Now since The Shaft, she's broke out with roles in The Ring series, Mulholland Drive, 21 Grams, King Kong of course and more. Before The Shaft she had a lot of roles but she was virtually unnoticed so Maas really scored bringing aboard the soon to be huge Watts because she really does add to the cast. She is a strong actress and plays one of the funniest, a little campy, and great roles of this film playing tabloid journalist Jennifer Evans. Evans is fiery, sarcastic and a little bit sleazy when it comes to her stories but she'll do what it takes. She's got a Lois Lane spark to her but will go above and beyond even if the story isn't entirely true. Although slightly overdone Watts is pretty decent in the role. James Marshall plays Elevator repair guy Mark Newman who is kind of first to discover the ominous express elevator. Marshall does a good job delivering the campier lines and leads the film pretty well. I'm surprised he's not more of a name now because I think he commands the screen pretty well. Him and Watts even have a decent chemistry when they are bickering and solving the mystery together. The supporting cast is a who's who of character actors. Michael Ironside, plays meticulously intelligent, calculating and disturbed scientist Gunter Steinberg. Edward Herrmann is the Millennium Building head, Milligan. Dan Hedaya plays investigating police lieutenant McBain and Ron Perlman is Mitchell. They all do a great job in their own campy way and they are a pleasure to see interacting together. Having so many long time veteran character actors make this a fun watch!! I mean all in all The Shaft is NOT good. Don't get me wrong, it's horrifically campy, and hilarious but that's what makes it so entertaining. The film was not made on a low budget, in fact it cost fifteen million dollars to make and completely bombed at the box office and in all fairness the special effects are excellent and the end sequence featuring military and a large rocket launcher is a terrific climax. All in all lovers of campy horror flicks must see this one because it actually has a decent strong cast and a hilariously original story. I'm only sad it won't get serialized because it's just a fun little horror flick!! 8/10</fullReview>

I suppose they were aiming for an easy "R" rating. I couldn't place the architecture and "look" of the building for a while, but finally it hit me. The director was a big fan of "Ghostbusters" and "Die Hard". But the shots of the top of the building looked suspiciously like an interior of a sound stage.I wasn't hoping for much from this movie, and thankfully I didn't pay to see it in the theater but I did find one truly eerie theme that other reviewers have noted. Shots of the world trade center towers are seen throughout the movie. The president is seen in a news conference talking about the events in this high rise building being the work of terrorists.

It takes a "goof off but great in a crisis" (is there any other kind of goof off in movies?) elevator repair man (James Marshall) and a spunky female reporter (is there any other kind of female reporter in movies?) (Naomi Watts) to prove that the cause is something other than faulty circuits or sabotage and more along the lines of thinking, man made evil.This is a slow moving film with stock characters, average performances from the leads, and some good actors (Edward Herman, Michael Ironside, Ron Perlman) in small roles. It's a B- TV quality movie. Don't mind mindless horror movies and home sick from work? That's the kind of time to watch this film. The spookiest thing about this movie is that it mentions terrorism, Osama Bin Laden, the 1993 attack on the Towers, and came out about five days before September 11, 2001. That kind of creepy can't be written. Rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got this neighbor who scours thrift store video tape bins to find what I can only describe as the worst misuses of VHS media known to man. The worse the movie, the bigger his chest swells with pride for saving it from oblivion. So when he gives me another one of his treasures I said OK, because I was bored out of my mind anyway and knew it would be a trek into weirdness. Incidentaly, here in the US the title of the movie is "The Shaft", my neighbor happens to enjoy the company of men so I suspect he thought he had stumbled upon a porno! Heh, heh, heh... :). Anyway, I popped it in the VCR and was immediately struck by the quality of the cinematography in the opening scene, really novel and well done. The setting kind of reminded me of some of the mid 80's films HBO used to run as filler, the look and pace of it hail to a previous decade. I kept watching and became ever more surprised by all the twists and turns, it really keeps you off balance and that makes it fun. I found myself talking at the screen and bursting out in laughter with some of the ridiculous things the movie asks you to accept. Just a great little quirky, surprising and fun pseudo sci-fi ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So let's play Management Consultant Interview and do some quick math. Let's assume 15 million folks in the LA area, each of whom writes at least a screenplay every two years, and, what, like, another 15 mil around NYC...let's say only one in three in NY actually spends every waking moment writing screenplays, but that they're a lot more disciplined about it -- so say one per year.So that's, like, 12.5 million screenplays PER YEAR -- and they decided to make this one? No new ideas, no script to speak of, no OLD ideas, no obedient tribute to past flicks in the genre, no budget in evidence, no clever way to say "look, ma-no budget!" -- and not even awful in that fun-to-watch way.Check out my other reviews.

		<fullReview>Now, a personal note, I will not write truly negative reviews, no matter how bad the film. I really am astounded at the people who take the time to write about why they think "Citizen Kane" or "Ikiru" or whatever isn't simply "over-rated" but "awful" or "stupid" enough that they have to warn other people NOT to watch them.Actually, I don't even understand people bother to rate a movie under a "5," even if they don't write a comment.That said, any "1" from me is meant to reflect an odd sort of applause! This is a really, really, really bad movie. In the best sense!The premise, of a bio-engineered elevator system designed by an obsessive ex-military weapons program mad scientist, is, well, pretty lame, however laudably weird, and the script and the acting manage to press every possible drop of the lameness by pretty much every bad-movie device possible: over-acting; poorly-conceived characters with insufficient motivation; ridiculous, yet lame, stereotyping; dull use of excessive profanity; ridiculous direction and cinematography.In other words: you name it; it's bad.The final perfection of the lameness here (and, no, I rarely use that particular word in general conversation) is that the monster - some sort of bio-engineered living humanoid braincell larva - is killed at what is supposed to be the climax of the film, before revealing whatever-the-hell form it was about to metamorphose into!You don't even get to see the monster!?!?!!!If you have time that's really in need of killing, and this happens to be on TV, watch it. At least until you find something better to do!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just for kicks, let's pretend you're a disgraced military scientist. You want to create "bio-machines" that incorporate mechanical devices with human intelligence. However, your first attempts were always kind of hard to control and turned out a little, well, homicidal. So the military fired you... but of course you want to continue your research. Well why not continue your dangerous research on an elevator in a busy, New York skyscraper that's open to the public? Seems like a good plan. What could possibly go wrong?That's the plot of this one. The elevator kills people because it is partially powered by human brain cells and is apparently evil for no good reason. Yep. Sound scary? Sound at all plausible? Didn't think so.This might be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The shocking thing is that Naomi Watts shows up as a newspaper reporter trying to get the scoop on the "killer elevator". What on earth is a real star doing in this thing? I realize it was earlier in her career, but one would think her standards were better than this. Did she read the script before taking the job? Ron Perlman shows up as well; maybe he failed to check out the script too.The dialogue is so bad it's hard to even laugh at it. The acting is hard to stomach. This movie just goes to show that a bad script and bad direction can make any actor look terrible. James Marshall is particularly laughable as the leading man. He looks like a high school drama student trying to remember his lines for the big play.The premise is so strange. Of all the things to experiment on, why would the scientist choose an elevator? Do we really need a super-intelligent elevator? With such a bad premise, one can certainly imagine how the half-baked plot plays out.It's hard to think of one good thing about this movie. It did make me laugh occasionally with its overall amateurish look and terrible dialogue. However, it's not a fun, campy B-movie. Down (aka The Shaft) is just plain boring, formulaic and doesn't make much sense.</fullReview>

Just pause this movie once or twice during a close up and you'll see exactly what I mean.This was just painful in every respect. I can't believe that this was done by professionals.

		<fullReview>Holy crap! Who is in charge of green-lighting horror movies these days, a cage full of retard, blind chimps or Hollywood cheesmoes who don't care about quality as long as they make another million? I hope, for humanity's sake, that it is the former because this movie is so stupid, so retarded, so insane, that I can't imagine a room full of people saying "Yes, this movie is good. I'll will help produce it." Unless that dialog was followed by "I am also very drunk and high on crack and have only seen half this movie."Here's the story- haunted elevator shaft and weird things happen in the elevator and around the building. What's causing it? Ancient Indian burial ground? Vengeful ghost of someone who died in the elevator and whose demise was covered up? Satanist? Aliens? Westinhaus the evil Babylonian god of elevators? Nope. It's a "high tech" new elevator maintenance system that runs off of living human tissue. For no reason. I think they may have mentioned why once or maybe twice in the movie but I was too busy laughing at the cheesiness or crying at the fact that this movie was made to pay close attention. Here come or brave heroes, the New York City elevator maintenance men. I'm not kidding. Our hero- macho- renegade- rag- tag- elevator- maintenance- man- guy investigates the spooky things that happen and finds out that the elevators were invented by some big- shot Yale/ Harvard crazy introvert who was kicked out of the ranks of military engineers because he did spooooky things with technology and living human tissue. So he made the obvious jump from military hardware to elevator technician. Oh, and he's evil. They never explain why, guy's just a bastard, I guess. And to help save the day is Naomi Watts who is apparently trying desperately to chuck all her dignity as an actress right down the toilet. She plays one of those dumb blondes with big breast that dresses like a twelve- year old slut but is also somehow a college- educated feminist with the clichéd radical 'I'm not going to take crap from my male superiors' attitude. Oh, and she has the same exact job that she had in 'The Ring' - the dashing investigative reporter. Figures, that. Listen- I'm not going to bore on anymore details. Just know this: if your in the mood for a movie that is so incredibly badly retarded it's funny skip this movie and go rent 'Deep Blue Sea' or 'Leprechaun.' If your in the mood for a movie that is so beyond bad to the point that it hurts your head thinking how such utter crap like this ever even got written down on paper and is so stupid it's depressing, however, then this film might be up your alley but you will still hate yourself for renting it. And if you do rent it, try to get someone else to pay for it. What a piece of crap. Oh, yeah one other thing: You were probably wondering this and yes, the movie does play Aerosmith's 'Love in an elevator.' Twice. Ouch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Devil's Elevator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** The movie "Down" is a lot like the Larry Cohen 1982 shocker "Q" which despite it's graphic violence and horrific and brutal deaths it was still hard to take seriously. New York's giant Millennium Building seems to be targeted by terrorists who are fixing it's express elevators where they end up malfunctioning and killing dozens of people. This is the conclusion that the President of the United States himself and his top advisor's came to. The building is evacuated and ringed with the police and army units to find who's behind all the carnage that's been happening there. For over a week elevator mechanics Mark and Jeffery, James Marshall &amp; Eric Thal, had been working on the cable equipment and could find nothing wrong with it. The elevators seems to have a mind of their own, as if they've been programed by some unknown forces, and keep on doing their thing by killing people every time they enter them. "Down" doesn't really try to explain what's causing these accident's were just given some confusing information about some crazed scientist, who worked in the black ops department in the US military,who's been experimenting with some chips that he invented and put in into the elevator mechanism. The chips took the elevator over and is responsible for all these killings. The movie also never quite makes the connection to what the chip has to do with the elevators actions. Were also never really told what the scientist Gunther Steinberg,Michael Ironsides,the inventor of this mysterious chip has to do with Mark and Jeffery's boss Mitchall,Ron Pearman. We later see secretly Mitchell meeting, ironically within the shadow of the World Trade Center, with Steinberg and being in cahoots in this off-the-wall venture that went haywire which wants Mitchall out this whole crazy plan. Like in "Q" the movie keeps you interested and watching it when it explodes with the almost unimaginable violence every time anyone goes near or on the killer elevators. The ending goes on and on with Mark and Jeniffer, Naomi Watts, a local news reporter attempting to get into the shut down Millennium Building to get to the heart of what is causing the elevators to act in such a deadly way, and put it to an end once in for all. Hard to follow because of it's very muddled storyline but still worth watching since the film, made in 2000, eerily and unknowingly foretells what was to happened a year later in the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. It's amazing how the earlier attack in February 1993 on the WTC is actually mentioned by the soldiers in the Millennium Building! were even told of Osama Bin-Laden's, the architect of the Septemer 11, 2001 attacks, involvement in it! Another startling fact about the movies comparison with the World Trade Center is besides the fact that the Millennium Building is also the tallest building in New York City and the same hight, 102 floors, as the WTC was!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretty horrendous horror film about a murderous elevator(?!) in a fictional NYC skyscraper. Not only does it try to make elevators look menacing, but it also fails miserably(and laughably) at doing so. The sad part is that this is artistically on the level of a Troma film trying to pass itself off as something much more, and the really sad part is that the production values are not bad at all with NYC locations and lots of extras, some CG work, as well as other expensive looking shots. Also, interestingly enough, there are several references to terrorists using airplanes against skyscrapers, as well as Bin Laden himself in relation to the 1993 WTC bombing. And as if that isn't enough, there is narration by the US president discussing terrorism while characters talk in front of the twin towers. Makes you wonder if this pre-WTC film was re-edited post-WTC??</fullReview>

Boy did the next object of King Kong's obsession come a long way from this pile of stool! I couldn't believe she was in this wretched mess but even in such grotesque toxic waste she shined through. I couldn't make any sense out of much of anything in this film. Another part that disturbed me was the reference to Bin Laden and the eerie 9/11-like feel during the President's speech. Was 9/11 the reason this cinematic fiasco went straight to video or was it maybe Ms. Watts' agent who made sure it was kept pretty hush hush. Of course now Ms. Watts is about to appear in King Kong, the movie pops up again on cable. This travesty deserves to get "THE SHAFT" and flushed "DOWN" the toilet!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a movie about a killer elevator, what can you expect. I didn't expect much, but this didn't live up to my expectations. I like keep an open mind and give far-fetched plots a chance, I can see the potential in the idea, but this movie screws it all up.Several elevator accidents in the land mark, The Millennium Building, keeps people worried and a repairman puzzled. When he starts to dig, it turns out it's not a regular elevator he's dealing with.The story starts out OK, but twists and turns and ends up being the most stupid story imaginable. It's with no doubt one of the stupidest stories ever and you just can't take it serious. At the end I actually felt bad on the films behalf. The characters are OK. Some of them are just really weired and you wonder what that was all about, but the leads are OK. They could've been better, but it works. The dialog on the other hand is at times stiff and bad. There are some occasional punch-lines in there, but they are so funny compared to the rest that they work against any mood of the film and along with weired unexplained characters makes you stop taking it serious.The acting is adequate. James Marshall does a fair job as Mark Newman. Naomi Watts is OK, but has done much better. The rest of the cast is adequate.What saves this movie is the cinematography. It's one of the best things about it. It's not really great, but it's better than anything else. The composition is OK and the lightning is OK as well. They don't really try to do anything out of the ordinary and I believe that's a good thing as I don't think they would've succeeded with doing so. There are some nice editing to and that lift's this movie a bit.There are also a nice score. It works as a mood builder, but it's underestimated. They've should use the score more to get this movie all more thrilling.The effects I would say are below average. The CGI is very obvious and has a very animation film look to it. The fighting is also slow and don't look good. The explosions are OK, though.All together this is not enough to say that this is a good movie. I was expecting a bad horror movie when I sat down and I was disappointed when I left. Unless you're a die hard fan of killer elevator movies I see no reason to watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How so, you ask? Well, it can be a slow ride, and while it gets you where it's supposed to with relatively little issue, it's not something that's gonna stay with you for very long. I haven't watched the original that the Dutch writer/director himself remade here, but it sounds like it's essentially just a bigger version of the same thing. The key to this is that it is entirely a B-movie. You're not meant to take it seriously, it's not trying to change your life, and it is quite cheesy. Fortunately, the handful of name actors that they got for this are all "in on it", and don't attempt to change this. The characters are unlikable, bordering on obnoxious. Acting is fitting for the tone. The dialog is also appropriate, with several one-liners. FX are OK, some are almost downright good. However, even for a hammy, "dumb" and just for fun picture, this isn't wholly enjoyable. It doesn't move as fast as it should, and at an hour and 40 minutes, it is *way* too long for this sort of thing. A lot of time is spent talking, and that's not what the audience is interested in from these. The ending is great, and there is great fun to be had during this, though. Editing and cinematography are straightforward, with at least one *marvelous* cut that I imagine will be effective to most viewers. There is reasonable tension in this. The cover was shamelessly redesigned to resemble that of The Ring, to cash in on Watts being in this, as well. And no, I could not tell you who the boy(?) on there is. There is constant gratuitous strong language, and brief nudity and sexuality in this. I recommend this to fans of this type of film. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Believe it or not this is actually a remake of a 1983 film called "The Lift." That title would not translate easily to America, so writer/director Dick Mass, who wrote and directed both films, renamed it The Shaft and set it in Manhattan instead of the Netherlands. Maybe he named it The Shaft as Shaft was already taken, who knows, but that name still wasn't good enough, so the renamed it "Down." What? It doesn't go up? It is really not as bad a film as many seem to think. I like original monsters, and a crazed elevator (or lift as they say in the old country) is interesting. You can certainly get some interesting kills, and we do here. We also get some interesting views from the top floors of the skyscrapers looking into apartment windows.Naomi Watts and James Marshall eventually join together to find the cause of these death, and wouldn't you know it, a mad scientist is involved. Kicked out of everywhere Dr. Gunter Steinberg (Michael Ironside) joins with an elevator repair company to install his microchips that are built with human flesh.Now, that is something I can use when writing reviews - a thinking microchip. "Hey, Ben, do you always have to comment on titties?" "Hey, Ben, you don't give enough credit to the monster." "Hey, Ben, how about a clever line on getting "shafted" in this movie." No, you won't get shafted, and I just have to do the work myself. The movie does have titties, but it also has Dan Hedaya, and I always like him.Check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good basic idea but the plotting leaves a lot to be desired...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea that a landmark building in NYC is having elevator problems of the most monumental sort is good for starters. But when it comes to the reason behind the elevator murders and mishaps, the writers had to be out to lunch.Some of the horrific happenings are well staged for maximum horror effect, but the characters are strictly one dimensional figures like puppets on a string. JAMES MARSHALL at least tries to give some depth to his leading role as an elevator technician who, midway through the story, accepts the help of an inquisitive newspaper reporter, NAOMI WATTS, to get to the bottom of the mysterious deaths on uncontrollable elevators.NAOMI WATTS must have been waiting for good roles to come along, but this was not one of them and she gives it no real conviction at all. The film was released shortly before the terrorist attacks on 9/11, lucky for the producers. After the attack, it's not likely a film of this sort would have been allowed to rattle the nerves of the already nervous New York City dwellers who witnessed an attack on their landmark buildings.RON PERLMAN, EDWARD HERRMANN and MICHAEL IRONSIDE are unable to give much gravitas to the absurd story, but there are several chilling scenes involving the elevator shaft that makes the whole thing at least worth a watch and some gruesome deaths by elevator.Strictly a below average horror film, enlivened by some good staging of key scenes but crying out for better plotting and dialog. The Ingmar Bergman joke between two of the elevator workers is an insult to any movie buff. At least Naomi Watts had KING KONG in her future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the most part Dick Maas's "Down" (alternately called "The Shaft") is your typical horror movie, with some people trying to stop a supremely evil force. But several aspects made this unlike any horror flick that I've ever seen.For starters, the building has that cool art deco look from the '30s. In fact, it looks very much like the edifice in "Ghost Busters" (especially that scene of the statue on the roof). But the truly eye-opening facet is two of the songs that get used in the movie. Not only do we hear "She's Not There" by The Zombies, but there's also the original version of "Come On", of which a later version was the VERY FIRST SONG released by The Rolling Stones! Oh, and later, we hear that someone blew his mind out in a car, just as The Beatles sang in "A Day in the Life".OK, so none of that really relates to the haunted elevator. But I found all that to be the neatest part of the movie. Otherwise it's a regular horror flick. We can forgive Naomi Watts for this one, as this was before she got really famous. In fact, just a few months before "Mulholland Drive". Also starring James Marshall, Michael Ironside, Edward Herrmann and Ron Perlman.PS: I notice that this got released in the Netherlands on September 6, 2001. Had they waited five days, a movie about unpleasant occurrences in a New York skyscraper would have no longer been acceptable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i liked this movie enough to keep watching it.....was this filled with gratuitous violence? but if a thing becomes alive and evil, i suppose one wants to realistically display the horror of it all. and i mean, of course one has to suspend disbelief to watch a lot of horror movies (and many, many comedies). but everything in "the shaft" clicked along well enough--played by the horror movie rules, and didn't distract me with silly scenes where a person might say, "oh, no way....." and i say this buying into an elevator itself being a crazy killer. that was kind of fun."the shaft" was pleasant enough for a late night escape from complete boredom. it was not as silly and unbelievable as much other crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie got 8 percent of votes: 10/10! Wow. I couldn´t imagine anyone giving this a 10/10. They must have really enjoyed it. There is a couple of good scenes, like with the skaters. And the camerawork is quite good. However, this is not a good horror movie. *SPOILER* There is not the slightest of reasonable explanations as to why the elevator behaves the way it does. Except that it is a kind of reference to the madness of "The Invisible Man" (H.G. Wells´ version, that is). Anyway, it´s an interesting idea, and probably impossible to perform any better than this, so maybe it´s a lame idea, actually. Very sadistic and without purpose. Take the stairs! Watch Saint Sinners by Clive Barker! It is much better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a VERY guilty pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Elevators in the Millennium Building (New York's most famous skyscraper??!?) start to act...EVILLY (cue mechanical laughter). Now Mark, an elevator repairman and Jen, a newswoman reporter must join up to figure out how to stop this horizontally challenged hell-spawned elevator. Fortunately the film knows that it's plot is ludicrous to say the least, and decides to play it out with tongue firmly placed in cheek, making the movie run at a good clip. Yes, you DO know that the movie is bad, but strangely that is part of the fun of it and makes the movie far more enjoyable than it really has any right to be. Silly brain-dead dialog, hammy acting, cheesy gore effects and all. But I'd be darned if I didn't enjoy the experience.My Grade: C+Eye Candy: Priscilla Hendrickse, and Sasha Woman show breasts &amp; buns as two hookers early in the film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Resident Evil would have been if it hadn't had zombies or sucked.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I'm biased because I haven't seen many 'maniac computer system' thrillers, but Down was a great watch. It felt like the Hollywood Resident Evil movie but without all the oh-so-serious dialogue and obviously the zombies. I noticed somebody namechecked Larry Cohen describing this movie's feel and script. They're totally right, it has his tongue-in-cheek thriller vibe all over it.The big problem I had with the Resi movie was they had a cool idea at the start with the sentient computer killing off all the SWAT/Marine types, but then went into godawful too slick zombie action. Down just concentrates on one idea, and therefore delivers it much more effectively. It also has an edge over many other thrillers in that it has a really watchable and amiable cast. James Marshall and Naomi Watts rock as the leads, and the supporting cast includes lots of great cult actors like Micheal Ironside and Ron Perlman, really bolstering the film with their performances.It's pretty far-fetched and very silly, but it does so in an appealing fashion. A lot of movies pull out this kind of dumb plot and expect you to take it deadly serious. The fact that Down doesn't adopt the typical deadpan approach is it's major strength. It's simultaneously funny, tense and exhilarating to watch.It might all be a little too much for many people to accept all at once though. A lot of other reviewers really hate this film, but that's their opinion not mine. The only possible turn off I can think off is that the movie is fairly uncompromising when it is violent (in a similar fashion to Resi, someone's decapitated by a lift, but unlike Resi, Down actually shows you their head coming off, which may be a little too far for the more fragile among you) so it may not be for everyone, but I loved it, and hopefully more people will see it for what it is, an unpretentious 2 hours of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>uninteresting remake with an uninspiring cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dick Maas once was seen as one of the most promising young directors in Holland. The Stephen Spielberg of the low lands. The Lift was an original film that showed a lot of promise. But Maas never succeeded to live up to that promise. But at least most of the Flodder films were successful but since Do Not Disturb even that is gone. With Down Dick Maas proves to be a director that used to be able to duplicate the work of others in an interesting way but now can only duplicate his own work in a dull way. He basically completely copied The Lift changed the Dutch cast to an uninteresting English speaking cast and just spend more than 10 times the original budget. There is nothing new in this film and the original is 100 times better. The style of filming is old fashioned and it looks like Mr Maas stood still for the last 2 decades.No cigar.Tim</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is clearly one of the greatest films I have ever seen. This isn't the kind of movie you would expect someone to say something like this about? It's true. Check it out yourself, just don't take yourself too seriously, the movie doesn't do it with itself either. Down is very well done, has good acting, and a well written plot. Yes, it has its extremely "stupid" moments, but it is meant to. It is part of its way to deliver. You do not really think this film takes itself seriously every second and is just a little dumb, do you. By the way, I also found it quite scary, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i want that 90 minutes of my life back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Naomi Watts must've been a bit short on the rent when she agreed to sign up for this turkey. Without doubt, this was one of the most inane, farcical and annoying pieces of rubbish it has ever been my misfortune to watch.There isn't even one decent scare in this z-grade schlock-fest, and it becomes unintentionally humorous towards the end with the extremely low budget special effects. Having said that, if they had spent the minuscule amount of money they had put into the sfx into getting a decent scriptwriter/s, then this might have been a watchable film.The dialogue is awful enough to make good actors such as Ms Watts and Ron Pearlman look like nothing more than animatronic simulcra in search of a personality, and in general, the whole thing tries to come across as a big-budget Hollywood blockbuster to no avail.I want the 90 minutes of my life back that were thoroughly wasted on this crappy excuse for a film. If i had seen it at the cinema,I would not just have demanded my money back, i would have stormed into the projection booth and burned the film print.Awful. Truly awful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How could this film receive 2-or-more-star reviews?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this movie, I entered IMDb just to see if anybody dared to give it more than 2 stars. Not only many people gave it more than 2, but some users gave it 10. Simply incredible! Or perhaps those 10-star reviews are a sort of ironic mockery?. Because this movie has nothing worth the value, not even to make fun of it. Though, after some reflection, it has some value: it is the ideal movie to be exhibited at cinematography schools just to show future filmmakers everything they should avoid; it is simply the perfect example of a bad movie: from beginning to end, this insulting film is boring, stupid, confusing, ridiculous, predictable... every negative adjective applies to this film. I rented the DVD from a Blockbuster, deceived by the plot summary in the back of the case: "Mysterious deaths are happening in an elevator, so an investigator tries to find what is going on" or something like that; "sounds interesting", I thought. Another misleading fact is the presence of Naomi Watts: if this renowned actress appears, at least it should be a decent film. What a naivety!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could of been an episode of "The X FIles"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this in Showtme, I decided to buy it on DVD. It was worth it. This movie was filmed before the 9/11 attacks. It could of been an episode of "THE X FILES" if the show hadn't ended almost 4 years ago. It's too bad it was not in theaters in the United States. I would of gone to see it.I'm never going to stop using elevators unless the building I'm in is on fire or I have to go up less than 4 flights of stairs.I'm going 2 watch this movie again soon. Watching this movie reminded me of an 80's James Bond movie witch has an elevator scene. There is a brief moment when the WTC attacks of '93 is mentioned (remember, this was filmed before 9/11/01) This is a remake of a 1983 movie I wish I could get but, it's only available in Germany on VHS</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mess by Maas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In New York, the express elevator of the 102 floors and 73 elevators Millennium Building has malfunction with some pregnant passengers and the company responsible for its maintenance sends two mechanics, Mark Newman (James Marshall) and Jeffrey (Eric Thal), to survey the equipment and the installation. They do not find any problem in their investigation, and the building is reopened to visitors. Later, the elevator provokes the death of a security guard and a blind man with his dog. The snoopy journalist of a tabloid Jennifer Evans (Naomi Watts) joins Mark to investigate the elevator, and they find that the equipment might be subjected to an experiment with biochip by the German scientist Gunter Steinberg (Michael Ironside).This DVD has just been released in Brazil (today, I guess) with an attractive tridimensional cover with a picture of Naomi Watts, and I bought it without any previous reference. "Down" is indeed a mess by Maas. This unknown Dutch director / writer wrote a story that tries to be funny; begins as if it were a horror, thriller or mystery movie; then, it seems to be a sci-fi but suddenly it becomes an action movie, with soldiers, policemen and lots of guns and explosions; ending with a romance between the characters of James Marshall and Naomi Watts. The dyed actress is very weird, with grimaces. The movie has a reasonable cast and budget, but never works. In the end, the best thing in this flick is the Aerosmith's song "Love in an Elevator". My vote is five.Title (Brazil): "O Elevador da Morte" ("The Elevator of Death")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie should've been called, "BRAINULA!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SO as of late, I've been on a Naomi Watts trip, so I rented this movie. I figured, Wellll....I liked the Ring...... ...quite frankely, this movie is something that bored me till the end. In twenty years, the guys at Mystery Science Theater 3000 will parody this and become popular once more, hopefully leading to a new movie/show.Acting and dialogue in this movie is laughable. The special effects were also equally hilarious. The plot bored me to tears, as I desperately waited for the movie to end. The beginning till about more than half way into the film is just dragging.The best part of the entire movie though, is when the skater punk flies through the window. THAT made me laugh so hard cause it was sooooooo cheesy!As a journalism major, i hated Watts's character....a stereotypical journalist who does things that all reporters would NEVER do!My friend Joe and I began to joke that since the elevators are being run by brains of living matter, it should have been called "BRAINULA!" This made the movie more tolerable. Try to MST3K this movie and you will succeed.</fullReview>
