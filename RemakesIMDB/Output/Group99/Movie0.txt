		<shortDescription>Obscure Holland-horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that Dick Maas' De Lift has become a true horror gem over the years and I even picked up that it's most wanted among cult-collectors. Well, here in the home countries (The Netherlands and Belgium) you can still easily find an old copy in videostores or even on flee-markets, so all you avid fanatics should come pay us a visit! To me, "De Lift" will always remain special because it was one of my very first encounters with the horror genre but even from a more objective viewpoint, I still think it's a very decent film with some genuine scares and an impressively grim atmosphere. The plot is far from brilliant (on the verge of ludicrous, actually) but that's widely made up by some effective shock-sequences and Maas' talent to build up slow suspense. After several people got injured by the newly installed elevator in a fancy building complex, mechanic Felix Adelaar is hired to do a detailed check up. Together with a persistent female reporter, he discovers that the production company has been experimenting with new chips that totally haven't been approved yet. There's a painful use of clichés, the dialogues are poorly written and ? granted ? there's a little too much talking going on. But, when the characters aren't talking nonsense, there's some pretty unsettling stuff to see! In the scariest sequence of the entire film, the fiendish elevator plays a deadly game with a young girl while the ominous music will make you move to the end of your seat. The footage filmed in the ugly shaft is really chilling and there's some excellent low-budget gore as well, with a nasty decapitation and a vile hanging as the absolute highlights. The biggest criticism I've come about this site is about the awful dubbing but, since I'm Dutch speaking, I luckily didn't suffer from that. "De Lift" was Dick Maas' first long-feature film and he also pleased the Dutch audiences with the happily deranged adventures of the Flodder family before emigrating to Hollywood where he remade his own debut. Even though Maas managed to recruit a great cast for this project (Naomi Watts, Ron Perlman, Dan Hedaya...), it totally lacks the obscurity and dark cinematography of the original. Give it a look....if you can find it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with John Hartl's review about the quality of this movie. It could easily have been silly, but it definitely is not. The last part, with Felix lit only by his industrial hand lamp in the enemy's own domain, is completely engrossing. The - quite sparse - music is eerily effective and the photography very good, as are the performances. In the version I saw, the dubbing is well done and convincing. Another winner from the Netherlands. About time we high risers took the lift seriously!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>De Lift was for me, as a 14 year old boy, very scary. The music, the cast, and the special effects, it was terrifieng, but I loved it. But the first scene, when Liz Snooyink is having sex, is typical Dutch. Not nice. I mean, is the sex-scene needful for the story? No. Another thing that was not really good, was that Huub Stapel's character is getting in a divorce, because his wife thinks that he's sleeping with another women. Dick Maas (the director) doesn't show how it ends with his wife. But Holland can be proud of such a scary movie, that's for sure!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish thriller reminiscent of Stephen King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do you get when a new elevator is installed and the evil of Stephen King's Christine? You get...THE LIFT. Dick Maas directed a stylish thriller about an elevator with malicious tones. Try suffocation, a blind man falling down the shaft (nice sound FX for this scene) and the famous decapitation scene. My friend was grossed out after seeing the decapitation scene. Nevertheless, it is up to our hero Felix (Huub Stapel) to find out what is wrong with the lift. After seeing this, I want to check out the 2001 remake DOWN, also directed by Maas with James Marshall in the role of the maintenance man in search of the lift's problems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An elevator seems to have a mind of its own, and it is deathly. The director builds a solid horror movie on people's fear of elevators. This is clearly a B-horror movie, but as such it is good. There are various truly shocking scenes. The story line is very simple. The main character is an elevator-repairman and he must repair an elevator that caused an accident. What he finds out is truly bizarre and unbelievable, but scary nonetheless.One of the best dutch made horror movies (but frankly, I don't know many other dutch horror movies).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So i was in a second hand movie store looking for a good silly, foreign overdubbed film.The Lift caught my eye. The cover of the movie exclaims "Take the stairs, take the stairs, for god's sake please take the stairs"How can you lose?Seeing this movie for the first time was kind of strange. The lighting is really dark, but the overdubs are good.The film holds ground nicely, save one part where our hero is talking to a scientist about chips that reproduce themselves, where the word "chip" was used around 30 times in a 2 minute scene.The hero of the story is rather well scripted, kind of cold, and cool.The music is kind of strange also, not really complimenting anything, but making the scenes stranger.I did end up buying the hour and a half movie, as it is a must see for any fan of silly horrors such as Evil Dead, or Dawn of the dead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watching murderous objects is a buzz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A superb Dutch film, with truly suspenseful moments! Nothing is quite so sinister as stretches of silence in movies, especially when they accompany Hitchcockian (which is to say here, predictable) suspense sequences. From the moment you read the synopsis, and figure that a film about bewitched microchips cannot expect to be taken seriously, you'd be forgiven for laughing at yourself for even contemplating seeing the film. However, If you're like me, and you consider that music, background noise, post-production, lipsynching, subliminal messaging goes too far in films, rendering terrible scenes risibly hyperactive, then you'll get off on the real-time sparsity of effects used here. Each delay to the denouement, agonisingly adds to the deathtoll. Is this going to change the world? Would a suspiciously murderous lift, in the real world? Tell the director, I'd like to see more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Dutch horror movie; perhaps out-dated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 1983 when this movie was made, it was a real shocking classic. Not because of the opening nudity-scene in the elevator (after all: this is the Netherlands and 'Spetters' had been released three years prior), but because it was a real scary and sometimes even gory mainstream movie.By todays standards it will probably disappoint you - the story about a rogue biocomputer-operated elevator is severely outdated and special effects are negligible. But nevertheless it really has something - eerie and terrifying music and some really scare scenes. Not the one with the guard being decapitated, but the one with the little girl begin enthralled by the three elevators is classic.Another classic scene is right at the end, where the surviving cast members take the stairs, 10+ floors down, instead of the (now normal) elevators.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"De Lift" (The Elevator) is probably the best Dutch horror-movie. It certainly is the most successful movie in it's genre. It has a slight sci-fi accent to it, lots of people will like this combination.Don't expect a great movie however. Holland is a small country and the Dutch language isn't widely spoken. Therefore, the budget for any Dutch movie will be small. Also, there aren't many Dutch actors around And keep in mind that this was Dick Maas his debut movie.Storyline and effects are meagre; suspense, acting and filming are scoring-points.And never watch dubbed movies! They are an outrage! Just like us Europeans, you will have to settle with subtitles.If you want to see a more balanced and mature Dutch movie, go and see "Soldaat van Oranje" (Soldier Of Orange) which is also a Dutch classic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elevators already scared me, but after seeing this...!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"De Lift" is, as horror/thriller goes, a movie that is more than decent. Huub Stapel is convincing as the mechanic, who is desperate to solve the puzzle. His determination to make an end to the terror is apparent.The special effects could have been better, if it had been made in 2002. But remember you are watching a movie from 1983! The shock effects, however, are up to Dick Maas' usual superb standard. There is not much gore, but to me that is an asset, not a defect. The less they show you, the more your imagination will kick in, and that usually makes uglier scenes than any director could believably depict. Do try to find the original with UK subtitles though, if you watch any synchronized movie, a lot of the quality gets lost, things like sarcasm, irony, annoyance, and amazement won't come through. Neither will the play on words, for that usually isn't understood by the translators, or they cannot find the right substitute. If, like me, you like this movie, you will like Dick Maas' absolute master piece: Amsterdamned. Although some of the jokes, are for Dutch-aholics only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was going to see "De Lift", I feared that it would be quite bad, because it's a Dutch film, and in general I don't like Dutch films that much. But here, I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. The story is quite simple: a demonic elevator that kills people. It seems a bit stupid, but it's more interesting than one would expect! The production values are pretty low because of the small budget, but nevertheless, sometimes this film is very exciting. Something else worth mentioning, is the music by Dick Maas(who is also the director!), that is quite haunting and creates a tense atmosphere! Only the end is a bit disappointing, but nevertheless, this is a good film, better than one would expect, so if you would get the chance to see it, don't hesitate!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched this movie dozens of times. One of the scariest and most suspenseful movies I've ever seen. I saw it when I was like 14 years old or so, but I still consider it one of my very favorite movies of all time. What makes this movie especially so creepy is its sound. That is, the sound of the elevator. Some scenes simply stay scary no matter how often you look at them. For instance the scene with the psychiatrist who's standing all nervous in the elevator. The sound of that scene freaks me out all the time. The atmosphere surrounding the elevator is SO creepy. This is a must see movie for everyone who loves a truly terrifying movie.9.5 / 10</fullReview>

I was able to see this version when I visited the US and found it in a small-town video store. The english voices pretty much ruined the movie.This is no reason to give the movie a low rating however, since the movie in it's original form was an amazing breakthrough in Dutch film making.

		<shortDescription>Lots of ups and downs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A new lift has been installed recently. A few people get stuck in it. A few days later, a blind man falls into the shaft. A guard is beheaded by the same lift. 'What we have here is a killing machine...!'Director Dick Maas is a big fan of Steven Spielbergs films (same here, but only his earlier movies). 'De Lift', describable as another alternative for the JAWS-formula, makes clear that Dick Maas lacks a lot in comparison to the most successful Hollywood-director.The movie has a few good scenes which are shocking, but the majority of the movie is surprisingly dull and tedious. As long as the story keeps to the elevator, it's OK. However, there are a lot of scenes about family problems and interminable discussions about elevators. Those do not build up tension, they're just very, very boring and though I am not much of a sadist, I only kept watching because I was anxiously waiting for the next person to be killed by the lift. In a very cruel way of course. One should not watch this movie for the story-line in the first place. The plot doesn't make ANY sense: how would you explain a killer lift? Anyhow, there IS some kind of explanation in the movie, but only kids under 8 years old would believe that nonsense. Under 8, for I watched this movie first when I was 7 years old and I was scared to death. Perhaps I am too old for this movie now..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obscure thriller with a surreal twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This little Dutch chiller is a cut above the rest due to the director's fine ability to maintain suspense throughout what is in reality, a slow-moving and relatively action-less film. The idea of a killer lift is at once laughable, but the makers of this film get over that hurdle by slowly and surely building up tension as the lift takes every opportunity to destroy anything that comes near it. The basic yet powerful music score (composed by the director, Dick Maas) helps to add to the feel of the film, a feeling of unknown terror and evil.The acting is fine; the dubbing is obvious but doesn't detract in this case. The male lead is more than capable of carrying the role of a lift repair man and is actually quite charismatic; we actually care for him when he's put into danger. The female journalist is surprisingly non-annoying, considering the stereotyped role she fits, and the pair spark together well as an early variation of Mulder and Scully. As for the others, they're more amusing than anything, especially the ill-conceived asylum scene.The deaths here are mainly off-screen, with one notable exception. A guy gets his head jammed in lift doors, and is then decapitated by the descending lift in one of the evillest, most imaginative death scenes I've ever witnessed on film. It's a masterful moment. As for the other deaths, they're kept to a minimum, apart from at the over-the-top finale. It seems that once the nudity and violence has been dispensed with at the opening of this film, it settles back into investigation mode, with plenty of dialogue to keep things moving along. The foreign setting makes a nice change too.The aforementioned finale is actually very good, with Stapel getting involved in some DIE HARD-style heroics while swinging about in the lift shaft. It turns out that all the trouble is the cause of some artificially intelligent computer chips, you could have fooled me! The final twist, where a cable twists out of the lift to wrap around another victim's next, is sped up and actually shocking. Don't be put off by the low budget or the obscure nature of this film, it's not a bad little piece and achieves what it sets out to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the most up-LIFTING of horror fllms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film could well have you, put off by lifts, as they have never been more frightening here. Of course here, what the viewer really wants to know, is what is causing this particular lift, the middle one of three, to malfunction, and display some quite scary behavior, while also causing a few nasty incidents and deaths, to some of it's users. Why this film works on a more realistic level, is the bad hiccups that occur with this lift, whether the air conditioner stuffing up, or the lift not arriving where it should, hence a blind man falling to his doom, these are real believable faults and they do happen, where the one in it's finale, is totally off the wall, and ridiculous. Is it being sabotaged, by a rival lift company, or is it just possessed? Looking into it, comes an electrician (Huub Staple- The Indecent Woman) who by the end of it, becomes so obsessed by getting to the core of this problem. We also see family life around this electrician, where the wife believes, he's having an affair with this reporter. I really liked how we see some family life around our hero, the relationship with his children. The lift has a lot of suspense, the most engrossing part, the last fifteen minutes, with Staple now checking the lift's devices, tooth and nail. Violence is very low for gore hounds, though not every horror delivers it's quota of gore. In fact, it's the better horror movies that have less. I'm not saying The Lift is good. There's something unavoidably dull about it. There should of been more poured into it. But is it worth watching? Yes. The last scene, with our two hero's resorted to using the stairs, played against a great finale music score is like a punchline to all those people out there who opt for the lift. Once, thinking I nearly got in a lift, when using an electronic card, it's awful feeling, where moments like this you give anything to make that other choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine Dutch horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Foreign horror movies are something to take notice of. In "De Lift", it's worth the watch. Dick Mass has put up a masterpiece that is reassuring and intriguing at the same time. Here you have a elevator in a very big building with one sinister secret. During a dinner party, four guests are very drunk and they go in the elevator to their rooms. However, it stops midway, and the guests begin to overheat.Fortunately, they do get rescued and sent to the hospital. The mechanic Felix(Huub Stapel), takes a look at the building and check it out from top to bottom for flaws. He finds none. But he's still curious about it. After checking it out, another tragedy strikes. Then there's the guard who lost his head. Felix's obsession with the lift gains the attention of a reporter(Willeke von Ammelrooy) who followed up on him. His obsession with the lift has put a strain on the marriage. Which would lead to the company he works for. A super chip has given the computer to give life which proves to be fatal. A very intriguing film. Fun to watch. Recommended for the rainy day times. 3 out of 5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An elevator lift with malicious intentions seems to be murdering people with no explanation. A seasoned technician is called in to see what the problem is. Little does Felix know what he's in for. I knew I was in for a bizarre movie going into this one! The sheer audacity to make a movie about a killer elevator had me curious. It's actually decently made with good intentions. I just had one problem...IT'S TOO SLOW! There are too many scenes in this movie where nothing happens! I love character development, but this was far too talky for its own good. They try to throw in an interesting mystery, but it was lacking. They should have taken advantage of a bizarre concept, but it looks like they bit off more than they could chew. My biggest complaint was the lift's actions not being fully explained. We get a glimpse at the end, but nothing is fully explained properly. Why is the lift doing this? why does it seem to have a mind of its own? These are questions that deserved to be answered. They didn't capitalize on the potential this movie had. It was a very claustrophobic setting, this should have been taken advantage of. There isn't much gore in this movie either despite a couple of brutal murders. Some of the highlights are a decapitation and a blind man plummeting to his death. I watched this in subtitles, but the dialog was rather crude at times. Felix (Stapel) actually says this to his wife about their son " See? He's not as stupid as you think" The acting is good for this sort of thing. The two leads reminded me of the two leads from Deep Red. Huub Stapel is very solid as our hero. His reactions were believable and expected. His vulnerable performance was better than this movie deserved. The last 20 minutes or so is the best part about this movie by far! It's actually highly suspenseful with controlled tension. I was actually very uncomfortable, wondering where this skill was for most of the movie! It was adroitly done, but it was too little too late. It's not an entirely bad movie. The last 20 minutes are great, acting is solid as well. There is just too much talk for me to recommend this movie. Horror fans will likely get curious from the absurd premise, but it's not as good as it sounds! I found this on You Tube, but it's probably very hard to find. It seems to be rather obscure and it should probably stay that way5.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's no escape from the...elevator?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"De Lift" is really just a bunch of set pieces strung together by an almost supernaturally boring middle piece. I know it's difficult to keep having people killed by I'll state again, an elevator, but that's no reason to throw a bong-driven explanation and half an hour of soap opera in. The piece de resistance in this movie is the beheading of a random security guard. The only reason why anyone has ever heard of it, the only reason why anybody might consider watching it is the beheading. Despite the poor special effects the scene is pretty effective, especially because of the presence of another guy who just stands there. It's true, when an elevator has trapped you between its doors well you're screwed. You can have the entire audience of Wheel of Fortune standing around, you're screwed. But the problem is, an elevator can't chase you, and they are not numerous to the point that you accidentally walk into one all the time either. Once people know there's something wrong with the elevator, well there's no danger anymore and there's still an hour of horror left to fill. But the beheading, that was cool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie still does it for me. Many times i stood in front of the theater as a kid when it came out, too scared to enter. Instead i rented it on video (betamax!) the day it came out. Well, it wasn't that scary, but you have to understand that at that time they were showing a lot of previews on Dutch TV, mostly the scary bits. Still it has very intense moments, like the "blood dripping on the shoulder scene", and that "nightguard scene", pretty intense indeed. If you watch it now, you get a nice look at Holland in the early 80's. I own the DVD now, and the commentary by director Dick Maas is interesting.

		<shortDescription>For the second time: incredible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is still one of the best Dutch movies ever made. It is exciting, scary, and it's got a small sense of humour. When I bought the DVD a couple of days ago, I heard at the Director's Commentary (Dick Maas) that the 'building-up'(I don't know what the English word for this is, but in Dutch is called 'opbouw') from the movie is 'copied' from "Jaws". In the beginning you see something terrible happen, and then you meet the maincharacter and his family, and then more accidents happen. The beginning is, like I said, terrible and typically Dutch, but Dick Maas said that it was to bring some humour and a little sex in the movie (because there was in the rest of the movie no place for it anymore), and that's, at my opinion, a good reason for this horrible sex-scene. One of the scariest moments in this film, is when Serge Henri Valcke stands in the lift, and blood is dripping on his jacket. Then he watch, and then the dead body of Michiel Kerbosch (who plays a cleaner) falls down. Although I knew what was going to happen, and the Director's Commentary was standing on, I was so much terrified. Really. And the most terrible but funny scene, was the deceptation ('onthoofding' in Dutch, cause I don't know if this the correct word for it) of Gerard Thoolen. Horrified! It was shot backwards, said Dick Maas. Dick Maas says the film is a little slow, and that he, at this moment, wanted to have a little more action it, but see the results: Down and Do not Disturb were terrible at the cinema. But this movie is fine like it is now, and I think that only Dutch people can love the movie like it's belonged to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than 'okay'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>De Lift, is not a great movie, but it's more than 'okay'. There are a few things that keep this movie from being the average laughable horror-flick. The Director does a good job on making this movie scarier than most horror movies about 'Machines/Technology gone wild'. Some scenes WILL actually make you jump 5 inches high above your seat. If it hadn't been Dick Maas directing this movie, that wouldn't have happened. One bad thing about this movie (and most of the Dutch movies) is that the sound effects are more funny than scary. Another bad thing is that the story is very boring at some times. But the good thing is that the scenes with the hungry elevator are really suspenseful and kinda scary. Like the one with the little girl in front of the three elevator-doors and the one at the ending where Felix tries to explore the elevator finding out it isn't controlled by any electric source, but it actually has a bumping' heart...Like 'Dutchy' said: 'The atmosphere surrounding the elevator is SO creepy!' This movie will make you frightened, but it's not one of the scariest movies ever made. If you are a true horrorfan, this is a must-see. Just one thing: DON'T WATCH THAT STUPID AMERICAN REMAKE ?DOWN'!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best eighties horror movie ever made (in Holland that is)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'De Lift' will not please every audience, but when you watch this open-minded and focused on the best dialogue you'll ever hear (check out Peer Mascini when he unravels the secrets of 'microprocessor-systemen'!), the terrific sound effects (the elevator), and the portrayel of Felix' familylife (the bowling-alley scene is the product of an outstanding ability of observation by director Maas), you'll realize that you're watching the best eighties horror movie ever made. And remember that 'De Lift' is the debut of Dick Maas! And for all you Dutch viewers ('cause I guess many of the movie's genuine merits will be lost in dubbing): de sc?ne met de doppen en Hawaii is toch het toppunt van kleinburgerlijkheid: de jaren tachtig in een notendop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by no doubt, the best movie made in Holland. Dick Maas proves that he had the ability to conquer Hollywood. Sadly, he did not. He stuck in Holland, where he made 3 flodder movies and Amsterdamned. There were some plans to make an American version of ,,De Lift" but I don't think that this will happen in the future. For all the people that are thrilled by horror; GO SEE IT NOW!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I did not particularly enjoy "Amsterdammned" (a similar sort of film), I gave it another shot because I did not want to believe that - as the Dutch themselves often say - the Dutch cinematography in general is just worthless (however, you DO get "tits, sex and throwing up" in most films ;o) ). I have seen "Antonia" and "Character" and enjoyed them both very much. Moreover, living in the Netherlands I wanted to know what a 'cult' movie that the locals consider "the most thrilling Dutch film ever" (4 out of 5 stars in a renowned TV magazine) looks like. Well, to tell the truth, I was nothing but disappointed. Even if I overlook the shaky idea of an 'evil microchip', the predictable direction and the cheap effects, I just cannot overlook the HORRENDOUS acting of the whole cast. They were all in desperate need of some Strasberg classes... All in all, if you want to get a positive picture of the Dutch cinematography, please do NOT waste time rolling your eyes up during this flop!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Next time a movie promises killer-elevators, I want to see more elevators and less elevator repairmen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is 5% horror, 60% boring detective work, 15% dull family life, and 20% filler scenes. It's supposed to be a horror film, but most of it is as dull as actually sitting down and watching a lift repair-man in action. Well, "action".It's as if a stuffy accountant directed this thing; even the main character is apathetic, almost always unemotional, with one facial expression (like a damn painting), going about his business with the élan of a nursing-home inmate playing chess with himself. I have rarely seen such a sleepy, disinterested-looking lead male/character. The makers of this failed attempt should have aimed for either a tongue-in-cheek approach or an all-out horror film, without the unnecessary and very tiresome detective crap and the evil-corporation conspiracy nonsense. Ultimately, the film's undoing is the writer's attempt to lend this ridiculous premise some seriousness by connecting all the silly goings-on to the real world. But there is nothing even remotely serious or realistic about a malicious lift killing people, so the obvious approach would have been to give this less exposition/plot and far more action.Will the repairman keep his marriage or not? It's exciting questions like these that turned the movie into the instant horror classic that it still is today. His wife's female friend speculates on why he's been depressed lately: "Perhaps he is having an affair?" she suggests stupidly, completely ignoring the plain-as-day fact that he's involved in the repairs of an elevator that had just killed a blind man and decapitated another. This does not enter as a possibility to explain his low mood? Straight to adultery ? duh; a silly plot-device introduced here for just one reason: so that the repairman can have some family trouble ? as if horror films with cheesy premises thrive on family matters as their main source of fuel. This serves as yet another needless sub-plot in a movie already choking in its own inactivity.I find it hard to believe that a building with this many accidents has people going inside it, let alone using the elevators, over and over, as if nothing had happened. This sort of story would be headline news in Holland (and elsewhere), and everyone would know about it. But this medium-level illogicality is the least of the film's problems. The fact that it's dull is what most viewers, and I, were annoyed by. Far too much talk, too much focus on the elevator repairman and even his very dreary family life.A 6.1 average? Had this been an American movie, the rating would have been half that. But for some reason non-American movies are reviewed and critiqued far less harshly than American ones. It's that silly old "exotic bonus", plus a bit of envy thrown in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mindstate '83?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I totally agree with the person who said he was too old for this movie. Seeing it for the first time again after I was 9 years old, I naively expected more from it. The implausible and continuity-lacking story, and the (typical Dutch) over-acting kills the suspense I was expecting. As regards the 'evil elevator' scenes, I was pleasantly surprised by the falling corpse of the cleaning guy, the decapitation scene and the hanging scene at the end. But these scenes are short and more of it would have made the film at least more entertaining. The drunk people scene in the beginning is very stupid and ridiculous; probably the maker wanted to give some spice to the audience so they'd keep watching. Mindstate '83?? The best scene is the one in which Stapel, trying to uncover the secret life-giving force of the elevator, is close-upped for a few seconds and then suddenly a hand comes from beside him towards his mouth. But no, it's his own hand and he's just putting his hands to his mouth plunged in thought! I don't know whether the director made this good joke on purpose or not (if you listen to the soundtrack you would think that). There is a director's commentary on the DVD, but it may take a few more years before I'm going to watch De Lift again...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good... for a movie about a killer elevator! (6 out of 10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Elevator serviceman Stapel takes it upon himself to investigate when the elevators at a stylish high-rise building begin to have lethal malfunctions for no apparent reason, but inexplicably finds his efforts resisted by both his boss and the manufacturer of the elevators.Silly to say the least, but surprisingly creepy and atmospheric despite its rather ridiculous premise, showing the occasional glimmer of imagination and humor, not to mention some nasty gore effects. The acting is adequate and although his voice is dubbed, real life racecar driver Stapel seems pretty laid-back and convincing in his role. However one character who gives a lecture on experimental microchips that is unintentionally hilarious, see if you can count how many times he says the word "chips"? 6 out of 10, fun if you park your brain in neutral and don't take it too seriously.</fullReview>

Before the software worked it had been to floor 8 and to floor -1 so the film made quite a lot of impression on me ! :-) I last saw the movie 15 years ago but was quite enjoyed by it, it was a good movie.

		<fullReview>A dark and stormy night at Hotel Icarus, and close-up of a girl's gaping laugh, before a loud and obnoxious group of drunken socialites become stranded in a lift. Fifteen minutes of darkly lit photography later, they are rescued. A lift repairman goes into the the lift by himself to investigate the cause of this boredom, and is followed by a female journalist out looking for a story. The lift's wiring, as it turns out, is possessed by demons from hell, causing deaths for no apparent reason, in all sorts of contrived ways. A well done decapitation scene (juxtaposed with a policeman slicing the end of his cigar) and a decent enough death of a blind man, as well as impressive set designs and lighting are about all this Dutch "thriller" have going for it. This film barely even qualifies as a horror movie, as there is so much blah blah blah blah blah it could almost be considered a character study of the lift repairman. Pardon me, while I yawn uncontrollably. Film tries to be a serious, atmospheric suspense/ thriller, but there is just no possible way to make interesting a story of a killer lift.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killer Elevator on the rampage! Um, just don't use it then?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Lift" is a low-budget Dutch movie about a killer elevator. The whackiest thing is that it's a mostly stone-faced low-budget movie about a killer elevator. The film was re-made as "Down / The Shaft" by the same director, Dick Maas, in the early 00's. This time he had a larger budget and a (rather questionable) sense of humor injected into the flick. Then 9/11 happened and the movie, with it's multiple terrorist references and NYC location, got postponed. It was conveniently released after lead actress Naomi Watts finally hit it big with "Mulholland Dr." and "The Ring." I enjoy the movie for it's bizarre jokes and dialogue ("I'll pee on them!"), but I can recognize it's not a particularly good movie.Well, "The Lift" is even worse. Apparently Maas hadn't yet realized how inherently silly a killer elevator movie is. Perhaps some of the humor got lost in translation--the version I watched was horrendously dubbed in English. Lead actor Huub Stapel is unbearably uncharismatic and slowly chugs through the movie like he'd rather be doing something else. Not that he's given much to work with--his character is a total tool that only exists as a protagonist for the killer elevator. There's not much here to redeem this film, though there are a few fun (but dated) effects that helped keep my attention for its duration. If you're trying to hunt this one down, you might want to forget it. Or stick with the slaptastic and goofy remake--"The Lift" is more like the long lost cousin of "The Mangler."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel that nowadays this film is outdated. Sure, the lift's bell-sound is still cool, and the wide shot of the three lifts in the lobby while the girl is playing with her doll is very exciting. But that's pretty much it.There are so few suspense scenes, and the whole mystery of the lift's background is not interesting enough. The reason why the lift goes haywire in the beginning of the film is actually hilarious, and it wasn't meant to be.If it weren't for lead actors Huub Stapel and Willeke van Ammelrooy, in 2006 this would be an abomination. Still, we need more horror flicks in this country!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Lift is great'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the perfect scary thriller of the Netherlands, don't read the other comment from the other user on this page, none of this is true. In fact, 'the Lift' has won 2 awards and another award for 'best DVD of the year'. The Lift is famous because of it's silence and the music. People always expect big action in these kind of films, but the silence is just great and scary. This is typical dutch, by the way. This silence is not what you see in 'Amsterdamned'. And 'Amsterdamned was way not as successful as 'The Lift'. The Lift was like 'Jaws' in 1975. When 'Jaws' appeared, everybody was afraid to go in the water. When 'The Lift' appeared, everybody in Holland was afraid to go in the elevators. So watch this film, it's worth fit. The sequel (Down a.k.a. The Shaft)is fun to, but not as original as the first film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Camp Dutch Horror makes for barrel of (unintended) laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>De Lift was made by Dutch wonder director Maas who later made such hilarious films as "Flodder" and "Amsterdamned".Actually 'De Lift'(The Elevator) was his first feature film. It starred two dutch stars of the silver screen including Huub Stapel and Willeke van Ammelrooy (who we also saw as the evil mother in "Ciske de Rat").Where 'De Lift' succeeds in my opinion is in it's (probably) unintended campiness....check out the scene where the blind man falls in the shaft and the janitor asks the cleaning-lady: "Did you say something, Connie?" -"I didn't say anything" -"Oh, I thought you said something".. It might sound pretty ridiculous but the way it is stated in Dutch (luckily I can understand Dutch) makes for a very funny, hilariously pronounced scene. Moreover the overall feel of the movie is that of low-budget camp horror...the plot isn't that difficult...the bad guy isn't that hard to spot....what makes this film work is the overall feel of claustrophobia and eeriness surrounding the elevator...and the ridiculous acting of some of the stars perhaps...Mind you that this all is better understandable if you are equipped with certain knowledge of the Dutch language!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did you know that elevators are twenty times safer than escalators?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And also twenty times more evil.The Lift (aka De Lift) is a horror film about an elevator. So the question is, will you be taking it to the top floor, or will you be getting off early due to the old man with gas problems standing in front of you? Of course you take it to the top! Even if this movie stunk, which it most definitely does not, you always finish off a movie about an evil elevator. Even the title itself rolls right off the tongue. Say it with me now: Evil Elevator. God, I love a good bit of alliteration.Oh, sorry, what's the film about you ask? An elevator that kills people. Oh, you want to know the details of the evil elevator story? Ugh?well, if you must know, during some fancy-pants box social that's being held at the top of some building, an elevator's power supply box (??) is struck by lightning, and thenceforth said elevator becomes conscious?.of its thirst for blood!!! Oh, you want more details? You're a pushy one, aren't ye? Okay, well, after a close-call involving Ernie the Evil Elevator, our protagonist and self-appointed hero, the Elevator Mechanic, comes along and you better believe he smells something fishy. People eventually start bucket-kicking in manners only an elevator is capable of kicking buckets. Cue nosey Reporter Gal, enter sci-fi mumbo jumbo, hit that button, which floor, to the top my good sir! De Lift's (aka The Lift) ability to manifest itself from a predictable, cheesy horror movie into a film that actually delivered effective chills, engaging enough characters, and even a boob no less - was not what I was expecting. I don't exactly know what I was expecting with this here elevator movie; I guess just something much sillier. Well, I was certainly wrong about that assumption, as the viewer is elevated to heights here that are on the level, and played straight ? on that same level. What I'm trying to get across here is?this is a good flick. A proper made flick about an evil elevator.One last crap joke for the road. Whaddya say? Want a crap joke? Here ya go. So, I tells Mayvis. Mayvis, I says, if you're gonna take a dump, ya gotta flush. Flushing is what gets rid of the poop, I tells Mayvis. She tells me to go flush my own dump. So I then tells Mayvis I don't need her crap anymore. Mayvis doesn't get the joke.</fullReview>

Let's face it--elevators just aren't scary! They can't chase after you or catch you. To avoid them you just take the stairs! Even if you can accept that it doesn't even stay true to its own premise. At one point a blind man is waiting for the elevator. The doors open--but there's no car there and he falls to his death. How exactly did the elevator KNOW that the guy was blind? Even worse we never get a plausible explanation as to why this is happening. We get lots of boring family drama and loonnggg talks about elevators. Seriously--there is WAY too much talk in this. Three times I had to rewind the tape to be able to read all the subtitles (this is from the Netherlands).

It seems to forgethow to kill, since it sometimes maims, sometimes just sendspeople to the hospital, and sometimes does nothing at all. Itdoesn't kill anyone because they harmed it, it kills because that isthe whim of the director. Yes, we have the scene where the guy'shead is taken off in the shaft, but I have seen more convincingheads on mugs of root beer (don't ask me what that meant, it justlooks funny). The final scenes, and why the elevator kills, are bothiffy.Thankfully, we have no sequel. Killer escalators or floor wax mustwait until another day to taste blood.

I am a horror fan in which I don't consider violence and action the most important things about a horror film, but this flick was extremely talky and poorly dubbed at that too. As a result of it being extremely talky, this film caused great boredom. The scare scenes which would have been effective in a tightly edited feature, fail to scare due to the films sluggish pace. The film is given a handsome look, but that wasn't enough to almost stop me from hitting the fast forward button in several scenes.
