		<shortDescription>A subversive satirical gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer-director Preston Sturges is generally regarded as one of the greatest comic talents ever, and his impeccable track record--including The Lady Eve and Sullivan's Travels--is more than worthy of the praise. Often overlooked, The Miracle Of Morgan's Creek ranks with Sturges' absolute best work.Sturges takes an almost Capra-esque WWII America and turns it on its pointy little head, with Betty Hutton as a girl who's more than willing to give "the boys" departing for the war the utmost reason to fight for our country. Stripped of her usual production numbers, Hutton cranks up her comic acting skills and creates a surprisingly rich characterization of a young woman straining against the restrictive social attitudes of the time. Eddie Bracken is his usual self-effacing self, and his sad-sack Norval Jones is an earnest, often moving portrayal of the kind of understanding, devotion and love almost never seen in American movies of the era.A "screwball comedy" only on paper, the often frenetic pacing and physical humor was sufficient to distract censors (and often audiences) from Morgan Creek's almost brutally derisive satire about the hypocrisy of small town "values" and military behavior during wartime, satire that still resonates given the current political climate. No target is safe, from "the troops" and bucolic Anywhere USA to state governors, the Dionne quints, and Adolf Hitler. Sturges pushed hard against the production code and probably earned a few ulcers slipping racy plot twists and subversive dialogue past the censors, but the results were well worth the Maalox. One of the funniest and most pointed satirical comedies ever produced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best comedy produced during WWII?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie may be the best comedy produced during World War II, especially in reference to the timing and the language related to the humorous treatment of a serious subject. Eddie Bracken is superb as Norval Jones, and delivers lines in a rapid-fire fashion that intensifes the satire. Betty Hutton as Trudy Kockenlocker is the perfect foil for Norval. Where Norval is witty, Trudy is coy. Norval anticipates problems, Trudy is expedient. Norval is so nervous that he sees "black spots" when agitated, Trudy is calm--though in trouble. And the constant conflict between Emmy (Diana Lynn) and Constable Kockenlocker(William Demarest) is typical of a wisecracking teen and an overly protective widower. There is hardly a funnier scene in movies than the marriage ceremony for Trudy and Norval. The humor in the whole movie seems to improve with each subsequent viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For the boys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Preston Sturges was one of the most interesting directors and screen writers working in the Hollywood of the thirties and forties. His incredible look at a small town USA during WWII is the basis for this delightful comedy. Mr. Sturges was a man ahead of his times. It's incredible how he was able to get this film approved for release by the Hays Code. Mr. Sturges direction was impeccable. It is easy to see how in most of his films he keeps showing a lot of the same faces, as it's evident the actors loved the quick tempo he gives to the movie.Betty Hutton was an incredible appealing Trudy. She shows us a young woman, who in spite of what happens to her, keeps trying to make her situation right by drawing the nerdy Norval into her side to correct what she has done. Ms. Hutton projected such a luminous presence as she demonstrates with her take of Trudy, the girl next door type, who finds out how a reckless moment of pleasure comes to haunt her. After all, Trudy only wanted to do the best for the boys going to a war where most of them wouldn't come back alive.Eddie Bracken was given one of the best opportunities of his career to play the kind hearted Norval. He is willing to break the law in order to make Trudy happy, after realizing she clearly doesn't care for him. This actor was an accomplished comedian with a great sense of timing, as he shows, for our amusement, in this picture.The supporting cast is great. William Demarest, who played in a lot of Mr. Sturges' films, is seen as Trudy's father, the nutty Constable Kockenlocker. Diana Lynn is immensely appealing as the young sister Emmy, an intelligent girl who is more mature than the happy go lucky Trudy. Brian Donlevy is seen briefly as the governor and Akim Tamiroff plays a minor part.Preston Sturges was a man that had an understanding about the times in which he lived. This comedy, as well as most of his other films, is a testament to his vision of America during those years. His films were a way of commenting about what was wrong with the American society during those years. Mr. Sturges' films made him the toast of Hollywood. That is why it's ironic how soon the same industry he helped elevate artistically, forgot him after his comedies fell out of favor with the public. This movie is a classic and the proof is in the way audiences are still moved and amused watching them after more than sixty years since they made their debut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sturges was a genius at combining slapstick with talk.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing this movie consolidated 2 things for me: Sturges's genius and an interesting view of life in the United States during World War II. This is at the same time a fascinating sociological study and a sample of what made Sturges a popular director/writer. The history of motion pictures takes us through a long (more than 30-year) period during which no sound was available except that provided in the performance space--organ, orchestra or piano music. During that time, performers were made up to emphasize facial expressions, and they mimed and mugged for the camera, using broad gestures and waiting for reactions and intertitles. When sound came in, slapstick mostly went out, and writers flocked to Hollywood to make the sophisticated comedies so popular in the 30s. Sturges deftly combined the physical comedy of the early Chaplin/Sennett/Keaton/Lloyd era with the sophisticated comedy of the early talkies. Watch William Damarest mug in this movie, or the perfection of his pratfalls. His portrayal of physical comedy is worthy of the best early Sennett or Chaplain or Keaton. At the same time, there is sophisticated talk, social commentary and political satire. Akim Tamiroff as "The Boss" is a wonderful little portrayal of the influence of "Tammany Hall" tyrants on politics in the US of this time. Hutton gets a chance to do comedy denied elsewhere, and she shows good timing and an ability to laugh at her own public image. Eddie Bracken is a well put-together package of the Sturges comedy trademark: physical humor, good comedic timing, articulate performance just a little beyond the fringe but not too broad for the time (remember that Laurel and Hardy were simultaneously competing for screens). This is a great movie for students of film, US history and culture, and of comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whew!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very start they're off and running. Even under the opening credits cast members are seen frantically gesticulating and flailing. And the movie has hardly begun.So what's to be done with the next 98 minutes, if one begins climatically sweating and pulsating? Ease up the pace a bit to allow viewer to catch his breath? Not Director Sturges: he continues to plow through this comedy at breakneck speed, as though any repose might prove fatal.We get two super energetic starts--Bracken and Hutton--and a cast of obedient supports obeying the eager director's every frenetic command. We end with one of the screwiest screwball comedies of the forties. This film has acquired a devoted following of supporters who find "Morgan's Creek" very funny, along with a goodly number of detractors, who see it as an essentially strained and bloated one-joke yarn.As usual, Sturges makes sharp social comments along the way and handles large groups with Capraesque skill. But that he manages to maintain his unrelentingly breathless pace throughout the shoot may be the real miracle of Morgan's Creek. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most audacious comedies ever made in Hollywood, this is a screamingly funny satirical farce about the World War II homefront. Betty Hutton, Eddie Bracken, Diana Lynn and William Demarest give phenomenal performances (Lynn is particularly funny as she keeps her composure while everyone else is cracking up around her), and Preston Sturges's writing and direction were never more frenetic and explosive. This is Sturges's most sustained comedy: he starts it in overdrive, and he never lets up. The movie would be exhausting if it weren't so hilarious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frantic farce is given the full Sturges treatment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an amusing farce guaranteed to bring some good hearted laughter as it recounts the story of a small town girl's indiscretion that has to be covered up with a series of lies. Betty Hutton is terrific as the partyloving gal who can't remember the man she married during a drunken joyride. Eddie Bracken as her nerdy but loyal boyfriend has the kind of role he was born to play--as does William Demarest as her outraged father who always has his shotgun ready and complains about having two rambunctious daughters. Diana Lynn shines as Betty's younger sister. Her scenes with William Demarest are among the funniest in the entire film--even though her 14 year-old seems a bit too sensible at such a tender age.All of the main cast are perfect. Demarest never had a funnier role in his life. His pratfalls are performed as naturally as the great silent comics.The technique of long takes with lots of dialogue going on must have been very demanding for Hutton and Bracken--but they handle it brilliantly. Many of their scenes are done in one long take and it's amazing how much material and physical comedy they had to memorize for such extended takes.Some of the storyline seems a bit dated by today's standards but on the whole the film holds up well in the laugh department. I liked it much better than HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO with Bracken in a similar role.Preston Sturges deserved his nomination for Best Original Screenplay but lost the award to Lamar Trotti for WILSON. Sturges was also nominated the same year for HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a miracle that it ever got released.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(The whole review is a spoiler, so, you know.) Virtually a 100-minute-long thumb-nosing at the Hayes Office, *The Miracle of Morgan's Creek* is the most relentlessly subversive movie in the Sturges canon. It's one of his very best, too, standing alongside *Sullivan's Travels*. *Miracle*, in fact, may be more purely pleasurable.The newly released DVD has a pair of informative special features, in which we learn that Sturges submitted the script to the Hayes Office in haphazard, piecemeal installments, thereby obfuscating the blasphemous subtext of the movie. Apparently, the censors never read the script in toto before Sturges finished shooting the picture. While Breen and the other Production Code toilers obsessed over a phrase here and there in the handful of pages that Sturges submitted, they were missing the forest for the trees. Sturges' aim seems to have been to construct a film in which nearly every scene subverts any number of the Code's sacred cows: premarital sex, drunken women, the U.S. military depicted in a non-too-flattering light, foolish peace officers (in fact, everyone in an authority role is made to look foolish), you name it. And of course, the overarching comparison of Betty Hutton's "miraculous" birthing of sextuplets -- at Christmastime! -- to the Virgin Birth is the coup de grace. Sturges even supplies a cow that turns the Knockenlocker living room into an incipient manger. All the while, we're reminded that Hutton is no virgin -- she was knocked up one drunken night by an anonymous G.I. ("I think his name was Ratzkywatzky"). Sturges sneers mightily at the censors by having everyone drink "lemonade" at the farewell balls for the soldiers, to say nothing of Hutton banging her head on a chandelier that is supposed to explain her woozy behavior the following morning. One expects the actors to look directly at the camera and wink. Or at the very least, intermittent title cards blaring "GET it?"What makes Sturges an artist, rather than just a clever smart-ass, is the humanity he brings to his fierce farce. Eddie Bracken as the 4-F loser is given some amazingly romantic things to say, things that would melt any woman's heart, including the heart of an over-sexed manipulator like Hutton's. In fact, Sturges is adamant that the Eddie Brackens of the world can offer a different type of heroism than what we usually acknowledge that word to mean (e.g., physical bravery). It's a heroism born out of a big heart, tempered by steadfastness, honesty, and ardent loyalty and love. The movie is a celebration of non-showy sacrifice, of the sort Christ prescribed. "Ratzkywatzky", the knocker-upper, the brave soldier, is never heard from again, forgoing one kind of responsibility for another -- the war. But Norval's there, trying to get Hutton out of the several sad jams she's gotten herself into because he loves her. Who's the hero?The audience will have to make up their own minds, because Sturges is remarkably non-judgmental about these circumstances and characters. The director doesn't frown disapprovingly at the carousing G.I.'s and the small-town girls who provide them "morale", nor does he celebrate them. These people are merely healthy, sexual males and females enjoying life's finest pleasures before those pleasures are snatched away by solitude at the Home Front and bloody death in the theater of war. The people here are rather like figures out of Boccaccio, trying to indulge in a little bacchanalia before the Reaper overwhelms them. *The Miracle of Morgan's Creek*, among its many other virtues, is a vivid reminder of a world at the edge of the precipice, and a stern rebuke to our current commentators who have unaccountably made saints out of this "Greatest Generation". It's a relief to discover that the Greatest Generation folks were lusty savages like our own decadent, worthless selves.An American classic -- 9 stars out of 10. By the way, I feel I must correct some commentators on the message boards and review pages here, because they're not really grasping the outrageousness of the Hutton/Mary-Mother-of-God comparison. The "Immaculate Conception" refers to Jesus' MOM. His Mom had to be exempt from all stain of Original Sin -- an immaculate vessel to contain and later convey the Son of God to the world. Mary = Immaculate Conception; Jesus = Virgin Birth. If we're going to be the good Christian nation that our brave President wants us to be, we should at least get our mythology straight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderfully Strange Farce from that Genius, Preston Sturges</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Miracle of Morgan's Creek" kept me constantly surprised. I really could not figure out where it was headed most of the time. I imagine that the the film must have been considered rather daring in its day--I don't want to say why, because I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it.No two ways about it: Sturges is one of the most inventive, witty, and generous of American directors (and writers too, of course!) . . . "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek" may lack the deluxe patina of "Palm Beach Story" or "The Lady Eve" (both pricelessly hilarious masterpieces, of course) . . . but: what a lovable farce! Everyone in it is superb, from the delectable Betty Hutton to the peerlessly grouchy William Demarest. And Eddie Bracken is goofy, touching, simply wonderful.And who in the world is Diana Lynn? I had never heard of her--and boy, was she marvelous as Betty Hutton's kid sister. We should all have such siblings!Very highly recommended, and for anyone with a sentimental streak: have tissues on hand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film-maker's response to over-discipline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I've always preferred Palm Beach Story this is my 2nd favourite Preston Sturges film (Lady Eve 3rd). It still makes me hoot with laughter or bring tears to my eyes by turns even though I know it's basically only satirical screwball comedy. The problem is that anybody watching this who doesn't know anything at all about Hollywood censorship and the Hays Office is likely to be very puzzled by it all and hardly understand it. The tortuous plot was solely meant to circumvent and sneer at the prevailing censorship enforcement, whilst simultaneously maintaining the standard decorum expected from media in 1942-44. Otherwise we might have been treated (among many other things) to coitus scenes with Ratzkywatzky, Officer Kockenlocker comically swearing his head off or at the very least a shot of Trudy's belly at Christmas. Nowadays with the relentless progress of acceptable "taste" none of this matters - we are not spared the littlest thing!The main actors give it their best and play it with gusto: live-wire Betty Hutton and 4F Eddie Bracken as the simple young lovers who don't find it so simple, Diana Lynn as her sidekick cynical 14 yo sister, but especially William Demarest who turned in his finest knockabout and farcically violent performance here - at 50, too. I think it also helps to have seen Star Spangled Rhythm with Hutton and Bracken really "enjoying" themselves in a ... more light-hearted way before seeing this. My favourite bits are the scenes where Norval and Trudy are preparing to leave home and get "married", both of them joyfully stuttering away.The Production Code was ridiculously strict - I've even thought it was designed by a bunch of perverts - but it at least provided some kind of discipline to all concerned. It's a discipline that is completely missing from todays films, except for my personal discipline in avoiding most of them. This is a wonderful film, the old story told cleverly and differently about simple people in Hicksville having fun and paying the price. Even only 2/3 years later Sturges would have done it differently, but along with Capra's "Arsenic and old lace" this has got to be one of the best of the many tombstones over the grave of the Hays Office there is.</fullReview>

Then, ten minutes in, I realized how charmed I was by the goofy comedy. Very daring for it's time - Betty spends nearly the whole movie pregnant, without anyone ever saying "pregnant"! I was absolutely beguiled by every character, even while they were irritating me!

		<fullReview>Great movies are movies you can't bear to see end, no matter how many times you've seen 'em. They play new the second, third, tenth time around; catching the light at angles you'd never seen them in before, gaining richness and profundity in familiar details while throwing never-noticed subtleties into sudden high relief. They awaken you to reserves of emotion inside yourself that are plumbed so rarely, you'd almost forgotten you had them in you all along. They are one-to-one experiences - even if you see a film like Preston Sturges' MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK in a packed revival house laughing uproariously en masse, you can only share a surface pleasure with those strangers: the deeper joys of this movie are yours and yours alone, shocking you into an awareness of how potent the alchemy of a great film can be, no matter how often you've felt that seismic shift with other great films. Even when you encounter an idiotic review that completely, callously, misses the whole point, you can't even get angry - how could you? A STAR WARS or Tarantino fan clucking terms like 'dated' or 'foolish' at a Preston Sturges movie is too pitiable a wretch to deserve actual scorn: maybe one day they'll figure it out, if they're lucky. MIRACLE turns out to be aptly titled, as this heady, unduplicable blend of slapstick, sitcom, surrealism and sharply observed slice-of-life manages to embody WW2-era popular entertainment while standing as far apart and above all its contemporaries as is humanly possible. The genius of Sturges was not that he ran end-runs around the censors but that he subverted them from the safest place to do so, deep within the fortress of the Production Code. The story of a small-town girl who finds herself both married and unmarried at the same time - but DEFINITELY pregnant in either case - is deliriously funny and brimming with great heart and honest sentiment, yet it's never less than a devastating indictment of the kind of mean-spirited provincialism that brought the Code into being in the first place. Rather than single out exemplary performances, I direct you instead to the complete cast-list (for the mark of a Preston Sturges movie is a wealth of expert actors, each blessed with scenes and dialogue devised to play to their respective strengths). Thus, the Esther Howards and Porter Halls shine as indelibly in small roles as the leads do - here, Bracken, Hutton, Lynn &amp; Demarest, all inspired. If you haven't yet seen this unforgettable jewel, beat a path to wherever it is you have to beat a path to, and rectify the situation immediately: you should be ready for your second viewing about three minutes after the end credits run.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in its own time period, when having a baby out of wedlock not only ruined your life, but stamped your child as a bastard. In these days of 'single mothers' that may seem very far-fetched, but it was very true. And I'm not crazy about laughing at someone who is stammering, either. Between these two problems I had difficulty finding this movie funny. At that time I didn't know who had directed it or what a marvelous reputation he had. I did know who Betty Hutton was, and she just made me nervous because she was so frenetic. I loved "Bringing Up Baby", but I find this movie just embarrassing. I'm sure the punch at some church functions probably was spiked, but I was the one needing a drink after watching this again. The idea the girl would have to be drunk in order to 'get married' and get pregnant just added to the misery. An entire town could turn on you under these circumstances, so the outcome of this movie is really the funny part. Of course, shoot me, I don't like "It's a Wonderful Life" either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A distinct flavor that no longer exists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Miracle of Morgan's Creek" (1943): A Preston Sturges comedy, set in the small town of Morgan's Creek, U.S.A., during WWII. It stars Betty Hutton (the Carol Burnett and Bette Midler of her generation), Eddie Bracken, Diana Lynn, and William Demarest. This is a non-stop, rapid fire, relentlessly witty, dialog-joke movie that leaves you gasping for air. On top of that, I heard more 40's slang than I've heard in years, and some of it is SO wonderful I plan on using it myself! (How's "Zipperpuss", "Ox Brain", and "Phooey!"?) It HELPS if the viewer has at least a minor working knowledge of history and popular culture from the first half of the twentieth century, since there are many cues &amp; references, including the "MIRACLE", which would've been caught and enjoyed by the audience at that time. "Miracle" is a totally enjoyable film, with lots of recognizable character actors, good contemporary costumes, and a distinct flavor of a time that no longer exists - anywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Magic Miracle Mirth In Morgan's Creek !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After viewing this comic masterpiece I find during my research that the real miracle here is that the film ever got made in the first place! Coming as it did in 1944 wartime the film literally takes the rise out of everything held so wholesome in those troubled times. Preston Sturges has in his sights promiscuous servicemen, small town mentality, and the church, and it all makes for a complete riotous piece of work. Throw into the pot that Sturges cast the pristine Betty Hutton as a man mad airhead with few morals of note, well you can see that Sturges was pushing the censors as far as he could.Trudy Kockenlocker {Huton} gets drunk one night and has a night of passion with a soldier, in the morning she has sketchy recollections but thinks she may have married the guy,! and not only that,! she then falls pregnant,! and sure enough the soldier has long since gone. This turn of events is a big no no and Trudy's on &amp; off boyfriend Norval Jones {Eddie Bracken} gets landed with the tag of being the Father. This sets us on an hilarious journey as Norval winds up being sought after by the authorities for a number of crimes he is oblivious to committing, there is no hope for the couple unless a miracle can save them.............The performances here are sublime, both Hutton &amp; Bracken seem to be having a competition to see who can out zany the other the best in each scene, and it really results in comedy gold. All the other actors give special shows as well, William Demarest is top dollar as Trudy's Policeman Father, Brian Donlevy, Diana Lynn &amp; Akim Tamaroff are all great, no frame wasted, no line a throw away, it's all right on the money. The direction is as flawless as the writing and it is just further proof that Preston Sturges was one of the greatest comedy directors to have ever worked, if you aren't holding your sides in during the final scenes here then you need to seek medical help immediately, either that or pray for a miracle......10/10 in every respect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funniest film I've seen in years. Excellent comic acting and timing. A bit of slapstick and pure silliness added to a delightful experience. I was up until 2:00 am watching it on TV. I was tired at work the next day but it was worth it. Story deals with the morals and dilemmas of WW-II America. It doesn't miss a detail. Guys in uniforms going off to war. Girls who think they're extremely exciting. The guy who can't get into the military - he can't pass his physical. References to gas and tire rationing round out the picture. Trudy (the female lead character) is a complete ditz. Her father is played by the same actor who was "Uncle Charlie" in "My Three Sons" and he played his role of a crotchety old curmudgeon to perfection. Norval - well what can I say?

Sturges just had the knack for pickin' the right cast...and this one was perfect in every way.That's not to say I didn't have any quibbles about this little gem. Of course we ll know that Sturges always puts a comedic light on serious subjects but his one stunned me. How did it get by the censors back in its day? For me, all I could think how could anyone make funny about a GI knocking up/marrying a girl who was knocked out? Isn't that kinda wrong? By the end I knew what was in store. The girls poor hapless so called boyfriend decides to do the honorable thing and take care of all her kids.It's quite obvious that this film is just that good, but I took a few exceptions to the content and making it into a comedy. Could have easily been a really good drama. As it was givin' to us, don't miss this one, it's a certified winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing For Its Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am astonished every time I see this film that it was ever released, despite the prestige of Preston Sturges as its director. The very notion that a comedy could be made in the war-time forties about a woman who may ---or may not--- be legally married to a soldier whose name she can't remember after an evening of dancing and "lemonade" and who becomes exceptionally pregnant as a consequence is mind-boggling. But, we should be grateful that it slipped under the censors' noses because it is still as smart and subversive now as it was then. Even the cameo appearances of Donleavy and Tamiroff are a witty commentary on Sturges's earlier political satire, the Great McGinty.A great movie, to be seen more than once and savored, particularly for how it bloomed in an era that might have been inclined to suppress it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast, often hilarious comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Preston Sturges, who wrote and directed this headlong parody of small-town life and war-time patriotism, was a man of multiple talents. Take his direction, for example. He pulls of this outrageous stunt without any razzle dazzle at all. Any modern comedy would blast us with funny music and shots that last about as long as a lightning strike. But Sturges' takes tend to be long, though not in the least leisurely. A contentious couple walking down the street may be followed in one take for half a block, turn a corner, and be followed for another half block.The story concerns mainly Trudy Kockenlocker (a tempestuous Betty Hutton) and her suitor, the good-hearted but goofy Norval Jones (Eddie Bracken). Norval has been in love with Trudy for years, even taking the same high school classes so he could be near her. "I didn't mind the cooking," he explains, "but the sewing...." Norval would be in the army himself but every time he tries to enlist he becomes so nervous that he stutters and shakes, his blood pressure soars, and he sees black spots in front of his eyes.After a wild night on the town with some soldiers about to be shipped out, Trudy sobers up the next morning to find herself married but unable to remember the name she used or the soldier she married. As always, Betty Hutton brings to the part the energy of a gamma ray burst. Pregnancy adds to the problem. Her young sister, Diana Lynn, advises her that she needs a husband -- fast. There's always Norval, ready to do anything for her. She prompts the innocent, unknowing Norval into a proposal, which takes him several minutes to sputter out, but compelled by her conscience, Trudy tries gently to spill the beans. She really shouldn't marry him, she tells Norval, because she made a big mistake the night of the dance. "What mistake? I thought you had a lot of fun!" Trudy: "Well, I did -- in a way -- but some kinds of fun last longer than others, if you know what I mean." The more Trudy explains, the more excited and frightened Neurotic Norval becomes. He stutters to the point of unintelligibility, occasionally interrupting himself to slam a fist into his palm and shout, "The SPOTS!" She and Norval decide to plunge ahead with the marriage anyway. They visit the Justice of the Peace in a nearby town and Norval poses as the soldier husband that Trudy can't remember. Norval is outfitted in the only army uniform available, a left-over deal from World War I. His collar insignia show the Marine Corps on one side and the Cavalry on the other. They must make up a name for him -- Ignatz Raskywasky -- which neither can pronounce. It ends with Norval in jail.I don't want to run out of space but this is one hilarious skewering of ordinary middle American life. The dialog is often corrosive."Daughters!", Trudy's father (William Demarest) complains. "They hang around the house like Spanish moss until they shame you into an early grave." Norval's lawyer. "Norval, I'm a lawyer. I WORK as a lawyer. I'm ready to sue anybody, anywhere, at any time." And, "You haven't asked my advice, and I'm not going to give any. But if I were you I'd get out of town fast and hide someplace." Trudy's sister (Diana Lynn) tells Demarest: "Can't you think of something? You're always having bright ideas." Demarest: "Listen, Zipperpuss, some day they're going to find your hair ribbon and an ax someplace, and that's all." One of the most mirthful movies of its decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The spots!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Betty Hutton is responsible for "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek," a 1944 comedy written and directed by Preston Sturges. A very famous movie and rightly so. Hutton shares the screen with Sturges regulars Eddie Bracken, William Demarest, Brian Donlevy, as well as Diana Lynn, Akim Tamiroff and Porter Hall. Hutton plays Trudy, a small-town girl who lives with her sister (Lynn) and irascible father (Demarest). On the night before a group of soldiers in the area ship out, a big dance is held for them, and Trudy plans on going. Her father forbids it. Instead she makes a movie date with a childhood friend who's crazy about her, Norval Jones. Poor Norval - he can't get into the service because he becomes so overwrought and terrified that they won't take him that he starts seeing - THE SPOTS - before his eyes, and he winds up with a 4-F. The minute they're out of the house, Trudy tells Norval that she wants to borrow his car and go to the dance, leaving Norval watching three features in a movie theater.Once she's there, Trudy dances with practically ever soldier there and goes out drinking and nightclubbing afterward, which she is unaccustomed to. She picks Norval up at 8 o'clock the next morning at the movie theater. Once in the house, she realizes that she got married, but she can't remember to whom except his name had a Z in it. Then she finds out she's pregnant.This is a hilarious film that many people have seen many times - there is an enormous amount of dialogue - if you took three films today and put them together, you probably wouldn't have the amount of dialogue in this film. It also moves at a lightning pace. It's so fascinating to see how this subject was handled in the '40s and how our mores have changed. The Trudy character could never have just gotten pregnant while unmarried and be unsure of the father's identity - or else the censors would have demanded she die at the end. The family goes to such lengths to cover up the pregnancy, even moving out of town to protect Trudy's "reputation." And poor Norval offers to marry her as the soldier, whose name she thinks is Ignatz Ratzkywatzky so she has a marriage certificate, which Ignatz evidently took with him. Since she used a fake name, she won't be able to find it in any documents.Today a young woman getting pregnant and not knowing who the father is has become a common plot. Trudy could have just gone out and had a good time, gotten pregnant, and the father could have been a soldier or one of the guys in town. She'd have the child and remain unmarried if she so chose.A lot of people don't like Betty Hutton - I'm not sure why. She was a vivacious performer and a fantastic singer. She is wonderful as Trudy, showing a great sense of comic timing. Her energy, as usual, jumps off the screen. Eddie Bracken has the better role, and he makes the most of it. He's hilarious as the depressed Norval. Both he and Demarest have some very funny slapstick moments. Demarest comes off as a meanie, but you know deep down he cares. His repartee with Diana Lynn, who plays his other daughter, Emmy, will have you laughing. I think in the movie she said she was 14 - I thought 17 - and sure enough, the actress was 17. Fourteen was really pushing it."The Miracle of Morgan's Creek" is a real gem, made during World War II, a fascinating time in our history. Many women met their husbands while the men were at training camps - so did Trudy - but she never knew his name. I wonder whatever happened to Ignatz Ratzkywatzky - and if he'd try to find her if he knew the result of the honeymoon!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the Paramount All Star spectacular Star Spangled Rhythm, Betty Hutton does a number called Doin' My Bit For Defense. In The Miracle Of Morgan's Creek, Betty does in fact really give her all to the boys going over there.How Preston Sturges got this one past the censors is beyond me. Not only the fact that it deals with illegitimate births in a light hearted way, but it shows the fighting men of the US Armed Services in a less than favorable light during World War II. But because he did this film holds up remarkably well. I like it almost as much as I like my favorite Preston Sturges film, Sullivan's Travels.Betty Hutton as Trudy Kockenlocker of Morgan's Creek feels it her patriotic duty to give her all for our fighting men. One night she does just that, she can't remember whom she might have married that night, if anyone and is left quite pregnant. Though how much pregnant we don't know until the end of the film.Eddie Bracken is her poor dumb schnook of a boyfriend who's a 4-F and he's willing to take the rap. William Demarest is caught between wanting to strangle the guilty party and seeing someone make an honest woman of Hutton. All this is watched with some amused detachment by Hutton's younger sister Diana Lynn.The Miracle Of Morgan's Creek got Preston Sturges an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Sad to say though Sturges was up against himself that year because he was also nominated in the same category for Hail The Conquering Hero. Both lost to 20th Century Fox's solemn biographical film Wilson.This film is Betty Hutton's best screen role in my humble opinion. And quite possibly the same for Eddie Bracken. Certainly no other director was able to utilize the personalities of both these performers as well as Preston Sturges.This is one eternal comedy classic, absolutely don't miss this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film a month ago and it instantly took a place as one of my all-time favourite comedies; the enthusiastic feedback of most of the other IMDB reviewers begs the question, Why hasn't it got legendary status on a par with, say, Bringing Up Baby or His Girl Friday?The core of the film is the amazing chemistry between Eddie Bracken and Betty Hutton; they summon up extraordinary levels of endearing daftness as Norval and Trudy, out of what was obviously very edgy material for its day. Presumably it was the sheer ludicrous charm of their repartee that drew the censors' fire. The early proposal scene, for example, combines pathos and ridiculousness like I've never seen done before and the result is immensely funny. William Demarest and Diana Lynn provide top rate support as Trudy's curmudgeonly father and smart-alec kid-sister and the entire film sprints along as a delicious combination of verbal dexterity and outlandish slapstick.Now how do I get hold of some other Preston Sturges classics?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have heard Betty Hutton's name all my life, mostly in the offhand comments of my parents. But I do not remember seeing her in a movie until this one. I will not repeat what has already been said about The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, an extraordinary film for 1943 when it was made but which I have just seen for the first time. I will comment only on the scene in the music store (occurring in about the first five minutes). It is the one in which we first meet Trudy Kockenlocker, the Betty Hutton character, who works as a clerk in the store. She is ravishing in a shapely grey suit with white hightlights, and her beautiful blond hair is done up in a wartime wrapped-braids do. But what made me fall in love with her is the exquisitely comic lip-synching performance she does of the record she is playing: Could it be Paul Robeson's bass-baritone in a rendition of a song whose lyric goes something like "Ring dem bells in the valley"? Her cute mouth is the center of this spectacle as she catches every subtlety of the original, scrunching up her face as for a moment she actually becomes the singer, sinking to the floor in a climactic attempt to do justice to the song's concluding long low note. This scene could be used as a definition of the word "charm."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Silly Stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After an all-night send-off party for the troops, a small-town girl (Betty Hutton) wakes up to find herself married and pregnant, but with no memory of her husband's identity.There were problems with the censors at the Hays Office over the film's subject matter. In October 1942, after a story conference, the office sent Paramount a seven-page letter outlining their concerns, including remarks made by the character Emmy, who is 14 years old; the potential of the film's portraying Trudy as being drunk; and reducing anything to do with Trudy's pregnancy. Of course, all these objections are part of what makes the film so darn funny, along with the screwball nature of it all. The scene where the cop tells a man over and over how to escape is just hilarious.Critic James Agee noted (not too subtly) that "the Hays office must have been raped in its sleep" to allow the film to be released. Although the Hays Office received many letters of protest because of the film's subject matter, it was Paramount's highest-grossing film of 1944, playing to standing-room-only audiences in some theaters. Such an interesting situation of humor trumping censorship... today, do we even have a censor? The MPAA is a shell of its former self.</fullReview>

Emmy suggests Trudy should marry poor sap Norval. Then it's loopy schemes, all kinds of cops, arrest, a reluctant escape and sextuplets. It's utter mayhem.The censors must have taken a bribe. The story is outlandish and inappropriate for its time. Trudy starts off not very well liked and that does stop some of the comedy in the beginning. She wins me over when she starts stuttering. For the first time, she and Norval match. They become believable as a couple. They're both idiots and they're still funny even today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eddie Bracken delivers rapid-fire and humorous lines as Norval Jones. Dianna Lynn has some of the wittiest one-liners as Emmy, Trudy's younger sister. William Demarest is their dad and constable Kockenlocker. He does some very good pratfalls, and has some very snappy lines of his own. Betty Hutton is Trudy who dances the night away with lots of GIs due to ship out the next day. The next morning she can't remember anything except that she got married and doesn't know to whom. That is the substance of the story that meets the eye in "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek." It's a wonderful comedy that Preston Sturges wrote and directed during World War II. There's more to the film, of course, and most of the humor and laughs come from what follows. Some critics of that time (and viewers today) wonder how the film was made at all. How did it "get by" the Hays Commission? Also known as the Hays Office, the Breen Office and the Production Code, it was set up by Hollywood as its own censoring office beginning in 1934. A number of books and video references have good background on this. The DVD I bought has two short special documentaries on it. Film historians, authors and people close to this film are interviewed. I highly recommend these videos (see more below). They clear up common misinformation about the Hays Office. In "Censorship: Morgan's Creek vs the Production Code," author and film historian Ed Sikov says, "In the early 30s, Hollywood was producing a whole bunch of racy, racy pictures. There was drug addiction, there was sex outside of marriage, adultery. There was sex suggestiveness all over the place." Author and Sturges biographer Andrew Dickos says, "There were scandals in Hollywood that reflected badly on the movie industry. The Fatty Arbuckle murder, for example, and movies were becoming more and more risqu ? showing crime not losing but winning and showing sex being available, not within the confines of marriage and family finding." Sikov says, "So, people became concerned that they were going too far ? that Hollywood was just pushing things a little too far." And, Dickos concludes, "The government was beginning to hear outcries and they decided that maybe they needed to look into the movie industry. The movie producers decided, 'No! We will monitor our own films.' Hence, the establishment of the Hays Commission. Hays was the former Postmaster General of the U.S..."Joseph Breen was a newspaperman who was hired to develop the code. So, there we have the Hays Office, established by the industry to monitor itself. At the same time, this industry expects its directors to get movies made. For most genres ? drama, adventures, mysteries, Westerns, musicals, the code often posed only minor or no hitches. But comedy- romances were another matter. They often had elements that could push hot buttons with the censors. Morgan's Creek was a story that pushed many hot buttons. In the short specials with the DVD, Eddie Bracken in late life said that the troupe of Morgan's Creek laughed at the Hays Office. He said Sturges changes made the Hays people "look like idiots." But, some film experts saw the result in another light. Sikov says, "What the code did was to force directors like Preston Sturges or Billy Wilder, or any of the great writers and directors, to mold their scripts around the code. In other words, it was kind of like a poet writing a sonnet. There's a form to follow, and if you follow the form then you make a great poem. Well, the form here was 'You can't do this and you can't do that;' but what you could do became richer because of the imposition of the code."So, if there had not been a Hays Office, would this movie be what it is today? No, because it was rewritten. Would it be as funny? Not likely, because most of the funniest parts were revisions or additions. Some say that the marriage of Norval and Trudy was unnecessary. Others say it as the funniest part. Strike it out and you lose big chunks of the funniest film time. That includes several scenes and much dialog leading up to the marriage. How about the GIs drinking lemonade all night, and not a single one in the brig the next day? What a hoot. This film clearly pokes fun at many things. I don't know if Preston Sturges was a genius. He came from a wealthy but dysfunctional family. His last name is from his third father. He was married four times himself. He slept very little, was a workaholic and died of a heart attack at age 60. I think he was a gifted writer and excellent director. He knew how to make his films much richer because of the restrictions. Some reviewers were bothered by the film's theme. Indeed, if one took out the obviously funny and unreal parts that got the film past the code group, it would not have resembled a comedy. In the 1940s, a girl who got pregnant out of wedlock was not a matter of humor. That she may have been raped by a soldier would, likewise not be something funny. So, Morgan's Creek turned out to be a great comedy ? not so much in spite of the Hays Office, but because of it. Sturges knew what he was doing all along ? even though the specific scenarios and scenes had to be worked out in steps from the Hays Office interceptions. When he chose the name, Kockenlocker, Sturges was signaling that we were in for a rollicking laugh-fest in this film. And the nice surprise closing makes a wonderful madcap and happy ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this to be a mildly funny and extremely fast paced screwball comedy. Betty Hutton is quite cute in her portrayal of Trudy Kockenlocker. Yes, that's her name. And yes, there are quite a few phonetic gymnastics required in the crazy dialogue. There's "Ignatz Ratzkywatzky" - the so called husband Trudy marries on a whim after a night of partying with soldiers about to ship out. But the problem is, she can't exactly remember his name and used a fake name for herself. So, she can't find proof of the marriage and is devastated when she learns she is pregnant.I'm not sure I like the humor poked at having a unknown marriage partner, and a resulting pregnancy. But I'm sure things happened like that during the war as boys were being shipped out.The dad is very funny and is played by William Demarest (male nanny from "My Three Sons". His pratfalls, at his age, are quite impressive and are probably some of the funnier moments in the movie for me. And the younger sister, played by Diana Lynn, is very wise beyond her years. Quite a mature performance for such a young girl.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A real rouser for war-time audiences with its frenzied pace, sprightly dialogue, and naughty innuendo. Between whirlwind director Sturges and combustible Betty Hutton, I half expected the screen would explode, but Hutton manages uncharacteristic restraint when needed. Her miming in the record shop of a basso voice from a deep well remains a real hoot and a charming use of her bubbly high-spirits. Not to forget poor Eddie Bracken as the hapless, love-struck schlemiel. I love his line that goes something like-- I was born ugly and thought I would grow out of it. But I didn't. I just got uglier! Now, how many of today's big-headed male leads would take on such a line. I hope they paid him a bundle. And, of course, there's roughneck daddy William Demarest and teen sister Diana Lynn who nevertheless looks at least 20. The scenes between pistol-packin' Demarest and comically cringing Bracken are priceless and every boyfriend's worst nightmare.The fact that the cast works so well is testament to Sturges's talent for orchestrating these frenzied farces. I expect it was that very rapid-fire dialogue that got wedlock babies and unmarried mothers past the public watchdogs. By Code standards, these were taboo topics, and notice that not once is the obviously relevant word "pregnant" spoken. Just why that marvelous life-affirming term should be banned alongside real profanity needs some explaining. Note too, how fast and loose the governor (Brian Donlevy) plays with the rules in finessing possible embarrassment. Sturges always liked to poke fun at these political types. However not everything is roses. The "jail-break" scene goes on too long, while the final few scenes barely escape the soggy hanky. And probably some of the humor is lost to changing times. Nonetheless, enough of the crackling dialogue and up-tempo pacing remains to keep viewers awake and chuckling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Preston Sturges comedy was way ahead of it's time, what with the storyline being about (almost) unwed Motherhood. Betty Hutton, who dosen't sing a note in this turns in a hilarious performance as Trudy, matched by Eddie Bracken. Another standout in this is William Demeraest who is a howl as Trudy"s Father. I understand that this film was held up for two years by the censors before it was allowed to be released. Given that this was the 1940's it is not surprising. The advanced storyline would hold up today if someone decided to do a remake. See this if you want nothing more than to laugh out loud at true comedy classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Agee was right: watching it is like "taking a nun on a roller coaster"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To quote the bard: "some men are born great; some achieve greatness; and some have greatness thrust upon them". Into the latter category falls Norvil Jones: 4-F Marine Corps reject and reluctant fianc of happy-go-lucky Trudy Kockenlocker, who after getting a little too happy and too lucky finds herself pregnant by an outbound soldier whose name she recalls only dimly as something like Ratskywatsky.Of all the classic Preston Sturges comedies in the 1940s none was more miraculous than this outrageous wartime farce, which dared to satirize the war effort while the war was still being fought. How it ever escaped the censors is anyone's guess (critic James Agee maintained the Hays Office was "raped in its sleep"); perhaps because the Allied armies were by then on the offensive Sturges was allowed to do likewise at home.Either way, it remains a model of sophisticated slapstick entertainment, as fresh and funny now as it was more than 60 years ago. If made today (under similar circumstances of wartime morale boosting: just substitute Iraq and Afghanistan for Europe and the Pacific) the film would almost certainly be vilified as immoral and unpatriotic, which only shows how dearly Sturges' wit is missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely outrageous!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't find it to be that great the first time I watched it, but the second time around, I caught a lot of the subtleties, which I appreciated, such as the sign about the lemonade and what Mr. Kockenlocker (William Demarest) says about a half a dozen of kids while complaining about daughters and children in general. I absolutely loved Emmy (Diana Lynn) and she was the voice of reason throughout the film despite being only 14 years old. I thought that Demarest's acting was great and the way he portrayed Mr. Kockenlocker made the character likable that I even started admiring Demarest. I can honestly say that Demarest steals the show in every scene he is in and that I've enjoyed it whenever Mr. Kockenlocker was in the scene. Also, isn't "Kockenlocker" a great name? *winkwink* The way Trudy is introduced was brilliant and Betty Hutton's exaggerated mouth movements had me in tears because it was hilarious. I didn't find Trudy (Hutton) to be a likable character and found her to be a bit exasperating at times. I guess it's very similar with The Palm Beach Story in that Trudy cares a lot about Norval (Bracken) thus she does what she does, but at times, I wanted to slap her in the face for being selfish.What I noticed about Sturges's films is that I focus on every scene. I don't lose track of what is happening and I pay attention as if every scene/aspect is important. A lot of films have a sub-plot with the romance but with Sturges's film, it is all mixed up and there really isn't a sub-plot but a main story that is told through various events. For example, with His Girl Friday, I didn't really care much about the sub-plot but with Sturges's film, the audience focuses only on what is happening in front of them. There are no distractions and I think I like it! I wasn't too impressed by this film but was more shocked watching it. I couldn't help but wonder how in the world this film even got past the Hays Code. Watch it for yourself and wonder if this film should be considered scandalous for its times! It sure made me confused and I couldn't help but wonder what Sturges was thinking while making this film. The ending is so outrageous that I wonder if it was a tactic to distract the censors. I know that Sturges used some tactics to beat around the bush so that this film could be released, but I really don't understand how the script passed.http://sachlichkeit.net</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another great Sturges comedy, though nowhere near as good as The Palm Beach Story. Betty Hutton is Trudy Kockenlocker (amusing name!), a small-town girl who feels it's her civic duty to give the boys a good time before the go off to war. But one night she gets herself married AND knocked-up, and can't remember who the father is! Interesting that this even got made in 1944, with the Production Code in force. I guess Sturges skirted around the censors by insisting Hutton drank only "victory lemonade" (yeah, right) and having her actually marry the father of the baby. Eddie Bracken is Hutton's stuttering long-time friend, who's been besotted with her forever. The guy's so in love he's willing to pretend he's the father, and the film becomes quite touching when Trudy really sees what a great guy that nerdy Norval is. Although this film didn't give me quite the laughs I was expecting, and the crazy humor seems strained at times, it's still very good. I especially liked the scenes between the precocious 14 year-old sister and her high-strung, yet caring, father.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Miraculously Exuberant Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some film buffs think that this Preston Sturges comic masterpiece is a bit too hectic. But I like my screwball comedies fast-paced, and this one ranks with the very best whirlwind romantic comedies (such as Howard Hawks's "His Girl Friday," "Twentieth Century," and "Bringing Up Baby"). The stuttering wedding scene in the office of the justice-of-the-peace (replete with Eddie Bracken's pants falling down to his ankles while he's trying to say his vows) is, for me, perhaps the most hilarious scene ever filmed. There's also the Christmastime birth sequence (an inoffensive parody of the Nativity), with doctors and nurses running back &amp; forth waving their arms, and the great character actor William Demarest collapsing in a faint (the culmination of a series of slapstick pratfalls). Then there's the tender scene in which an exhausted Betty Hutton softly tells Eddie Bracken that he will be a true &amp; loving father even though he's not the birth father (which must have had rich resonance for writer/director Preston Sturges, since he was raised by a loving stepfather) --- a poignant interlude devoid of Capraesque sentimentality. And, finally, we have one last pratfall faint, when Eddie Bracken realizes that he's the stepfather of sextuplets. Allegedly, some Hollywood producers and directors complained to censor Will Hays about his overlooking so much risqu innuendo in this film --- they wanted to know why he allowed Preston Sturges to get away with it --- allegedly, Will Hays told them that he was inclined to allow a bit more leeway to Sturges because his stuff somehow managed to be simultaneously tasteful, outrageous, and very funny. Paramount waited 2 years to release this film -- it was made in 1942, but released in 1944 --- the studio was afraid that it would be denounced from church pulpits. Well, despite the Nativity parody, preachers accepted it in its intended non-offensive spirit. There were no howls of protest from the clergy, and the film was a box office hit. Detailed accounts of this 2-year studio delay can be found in 2 wonderful books -- "Between Flops" by James Curtis (still the best biography to date of Preston Sturges), and "Romantic Comedy in Hollywood from Lubitsch to Sturges" by James Harvey.I anxiously await the DVD release of this masterpiece --- I've been told (via e-mail from son Tom Sturges) that it will include a wonderful interview with the late Eddie Bracken, who remained to the end a beloved friend to the Sturges family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic comedy showcases Bracken's comedic genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For ten years, Preston Sturges was an unparalleled comic genius, and this is one of his signature works. I watched this one tonight as a tribute to the late Eddie Bracken who died yesterday. Bracken was gifted physical comedian with an earnest face. He was perfectly cast as the meek bank clerk who manipulative Betty Hutton has wrapped around her little finger. Hutton perfectly blends sweetness and naivete with guile and willfulness --- not the easiest of combinations, but she does it perfectly. Contrary to some comments, the issues of illegitimacy and soldier vs. civilian were dealt with sincerity and good humor in the context of the time. Slapstick, double entendres, and quick hitters bleand seamlessly to keep viewers who understand the contexts amused throughout. Jimmy Conlan, William Demarest, and the rest of Sturges' stock company are all marvelous. The cameos of Brian Donlevy as The Great McGinty and Akim Tamiroff as the Boss from the earlier Sturges classic comedy were fitting and hysterical. Although Diana Lynn was quite enjoyable and did a great job in her role, her character's wisdom and practical nature seemed purposefully out-of-synch with her age, her other family members, and the townspeople. That struck a minor discordant note for me, but just a nit to pick in the scheme of things. Overall, this comedy deserves its classic status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Sturges masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Preston Sturges does it again with this brilliant WWII comedy that, as usual, mixes cynical satire with sentiment. Betty Hutton is great as a woman who thinks she married an anonymous soldier in what may or may not have been a one-night stand (how did this one get past the censors of the time?) and hapless Eddie Bracken does his usual good work as the lovestruck loser willing to help her out. Standouts in the cast also include the sterling Diana Lynn, who should have become a star based on her performance here, and Sturges regular William Demarest at his crustiest. Unlike many comedies, the plot is completely unpredictable, although it all makes sense. Sturges provides his typical crackling dialogue and manages to get in some patriotic moments. I rate it a 10.</fullReview>

And I truly enjoyed it! I just loved the actors who portrayed Norval and Trudy. I just knew they were meant for each other. My favorite scene is at the end when Norval finds out that Trudy gave birth to six children and Norval fainted! I was dying! I suggest to anybody to give this movie a chance.

		<shortDescription>Not only funny, but completely lovable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some scenes which are just perfect in their comedic ability, such as the scene where Trudy subtly tries to make Norval propose to her. Much of the comedy is not of the laugh-out-loud variety, but rather of the smile and maybe giggle variety. Plus, it may be a bit hard for younger people to enjoy, for it is certainly dated. I.e., you have to be aware of code restrictions and you have to accept them.Even if it weren't for the comedy, though, this film would be just as wonderful, anyway, for Sturges, a comedy genius, gives us characters whom we truly care for. We love Trudy and Norval. They are amongst the most endearing characters I've ever met at the movies. Emmy and the constable are just as lovely, and by the ending, I hardly wanted to leave them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just what was the 'miracle' of Morgan's Creek?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course, the most amazing 'miracle' is that the Sturges satirical screwball farce ever passed the absurdly restricting Hays censor board. Despite all the reviews I checked over, I didn't find any that dwelled on the identity of the miracle. Clearly, the miracle in the story is the birth of sextuplet boys by Trudy: a small town late teen, who didn't remember having sex with a man, and didn't remember the identity of a possible 'one night stand' husband. Also, the boys were born on or near Christmas, which alludes to the possibility that the sextuplets represent a grossly exaggerated instance of virgin birth, as claimed to have occurred with Mary, mother of Jesus. Clearly, the sextuplets represent a yet more unbelievable birth than that of the then famous Dionne quintuplets of Ontario, hence the newspaper headline 'Canada protests'. At that time, no live set of sextuplets had ever been recorded in North America. The extreme frenetic reaction of the state governor and retinue and the press, and fearful reactions of Mussolini and Hitler are largely a satire on the extent to which the Dionne quintuplets were the object of awe during the preceding decade, when they were taken from their parents and exhibited as 'freaks' to some millions of paying curiosity seekers, helping Ontario survive The Depression.Aside from the governor, there are 4 principle characters. Three: older teen Trudy(Betty Hutton), min-teen Emmy, and her father(William Demarest), have the last name of Kockenlocker, while Trudy's nerdy, stuttering, boyfriend Norval(Eddie Bracken) has the bland name of Jones. I would imagine the somewhat tongue-twisting, yet lyrically memorable, Kockenlocker is derived from Washington Irving's alteration of the Dutch name Knickerbacker to Knickerbocker. An equally ridiculous- sounding name is also periodically bandied about, as Trudy's possible vanished GI husband, in a night of partying with some GIs about to leave: Ratzkywatsky. Despite it's memory-challenging nature to non-Slavs, it also has a lyrical quality that aids its interest and remembrance. I suppose Sturges was satirizing the many inane, often difficult to remember, names many people are saddled with. They also clearly represent verbal slapstick.William Demarest is excellent as the crusty veteran small town constable and Trudy's watchful father, saddled with trying to help figure out the best way to deal with the inane problems generated by Trudy's wild night. Of course, his attempts to help make the best of the situation only get himself and Norval deeper in trouble, in a hilarious series of incidents. See the film to discover the details!Demarest had a long Hollywood career, followed by a TV career. Having seen him in a few other films, he impresses me as Paramount's version of Spencer Tracy, with a dose of William Bendix added. Tracy, of course, would later be in a somewhat similar situation in "Father of the Bride"; considerably less comical than the present film. Demarest would again be part of the Hutton-staring "The Perils of Pauline", as her included film director.Bracken and Betty made an excellent team as sympathetic na?ve dimwits, with a long simmering romantic relationship. This film, although not released until '44, was actually made in '42. Thus, it was the 4th and last film audiences saw that teamed Betty with Bracken: "The Fleet's In", "Star Spangled Rhythm, and "Happy go Lucky" being the others. Bracken usually played his typecast Don Knots' or Bob Hope-like character. He would be reteamed with Demarest, as his sergeant, in "Hail The Conquering Hero".Bryan Donlevy gets a respite from his common role in this era as a classy, sneaky, villain, playing the comically corrupt state governor, Dan McGinty: reprising this identity from the previous "The Great McGinty". He's always part of a frenetic circus in his office, relating to Trudy's predicaments, as part of a satire on the seriousness of the times given to women in her predicament, and to the Canadian quintuplets. The film begins with him getting a phone call from a reporter about a very newsworthy event in the obscure town of Morgan's Creek., which causes Donlevy to go berserk. We aren't told the nature of this event, and don't see Donlevy again until toward the end. Trudy's story up until this event is then told from retrospect. We first meet Trudy, working in a music store, lip-syncing to a record of a deep base singer, mugging like Lucille Ball, in her much later TV series., and reminding us of Stan Laurel, in "Way Out West". Yes, Betty does much remind me of the later, comical, Lucy.My main criticism of the film is that the whole beginning episode, where Trudy goes on a movie date with Norval, but really wants to dance and party with some anonymous soldiers about to leave town, is wholly unbelievable. To stop her crying, Norval agrees to loan her his car and go to the movie by himself, while she goes to party with the soldiers all night(a satire on the power of feminine desires to make some men do idiotic things to please them, I assume). She arrives back in the morning, claiming she can't remember the events of the last few hours, until she 'awoke' to find herself driving his car, and not remembering it's his car! Later, she finds a cheap ring on her finger, a 'just married' sign in the car, remembers a soldier jesting at the party that they all get married, and wonders if she agreed to a marriage(and maybe sex?) while in some semi-conscious state, claiming she had drunk nothing but some lemonade. An alien abduction sounds just as plausible! Probably, Sturges figured he had to do it this way to get around the sensor board.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Preston Sturges, was the King of the Screwball Comedies in the 1940's. It would take a genius to find the core plot funny. A teen-ager (Betty Hutton) goes to a WWII soldiers benefit dance and comes home married AND pregnant. Perhaps this was Sturges's contribution to War Effort. Eddie Bracken plays the dumbest and blindly in love cluck ever played. Perhaps it was salve for the many soldiers who did exactly what happens in this movie, with the exception of getting married. For the millions of men serving in WWII at the time this movie was made and first shown, there must have been at least a million who had short liaisons with the local gals, and had left some of them with a child. Many of them knew they wouldn't return and would leave their offspring for others to raise. You can't watch this movie without remembering when it was made. It was also made around the time when Quintuplets were born in Canada, which was at the time the highest birth count known.The cameo roles played by Akim Tamiroff and Brian Dunleavy were also recent in the public's mind. They had played a pair of lovable but dishonest politicians who believed that they made the truth fit their political schemes. In the end, Bracken who is medically unsuited for the military becomes a Colonel in the State Guard. All of his charges for molesting a minor, committing bigamy, bank robbery and escaping from jail are dismissed by the Governor (Dunleavy) to sanitize the facts for the benefit of Morgan Creek and the State. In 1944, illegitimacy still carried a social stigma but all was forgiven when Hutton delivers 6 boys, then a world record.When Betty Hutton made this movie, her fame was that of a female vocalist known for her peppy and outrageous style. She wanted a role that was strictly dramatic, and she plays her role with a believable innocence offset by her younger but wiser sister who suggests that Hutton marry Bracken because he is a "perfect cluck" once it is discovered that a child is on it's way. The hardest pill for the viewer to swallow is at the core of the plot. Hutton does not recall getting married, having sex, and does not even know who the father and husband is.Braken plays the cluck who agrees to give cover to Hutton, so that she can go on the eventful date. Her father, the town constable would not approve on the date, so Bracken is convinced to go to the movies and give his car to the girl he loved since grade school. (In 1944 driving was a rationed luxury for all civilians.) Hutton finally drives to the long closed movie house where Bracken is still waiting in the morning sunlight. His car is wrecked and he must face the wrath of the father, without enjoying any of the benefits. Bracken continues to play the love struck cluck as he agrees to marry Hutton by committing bigamy. His reward is being arrested, and thrown in jail by Hutton's father played by a William Demerest, who after finding out the facts, decides to let Bracken "escape" from jail. Bracken and Demerest are hilariously funny as Demerest tries his best to get Bracken to escape. It is only when Hutton and her sister arrive that Bracken is persuaded to leave town, in search of the missing soldier-husband. Bracken who plays a bank clerk, decides to make an early withdrawal of his own bonds. When the alarm goes off, Braken leaves town wanted as a bank robber in addition to his other problems. Demerest tries to explain the "innocent" reasons for Brackens behavior but ends up fired, and they move to a farm to escape the embarrassment.Bracken gives up his quest for the unknown soldier and returns to town and gets noticed by his former boss, who proceeds to get him thrown back into jail. One final attempt at clearing Bracken's name is interrupted by the admittance of Hutton to the hospital. As the record number of boys reaches 6, all is forgiven, proving that there is hope for all the dumb clucks of the world if their luck holds out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to rectify the misunderstanding so many reviewers have about the Betty Hutton character, Trudy Kockenlocker ("...a reckless moment of pleasure...", "...a drunken joyride...", "...one drunken night...", "...more than willing to give "the boys" departing for the war...", etc). Even Peter Bogdanovich, in his introduction to this movie on Turner Classic Movies' "The Essentials", refers to her drinking too much! In fact, Trudy didn't drink. She was, however, thrown up during the dancing and hits her head on a hanging light fixture. Sturges even adds the sound of clashing cymbals to sync with the hit, as well as a close-up of the aforesaid fixture swinging back and forth.The next day, Trudy explains several times that she doesn't drink and comments on how something happened during the dancing that caused her to forget.For those of you who love this movie, I recommend watching it again and looking closely at the happenings of "that night" and Trudy's refutations through the rest of the movie -- as if you needed an excuse!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Miracle of Morgan's Creek", like most Preston Sturges films, starts out maniacally, this time told in a series of flashbacks. Trudy Kockenlocker (Hutton) is a small-town girl working in a music store who decides that it is her patriotic duty to attend several dances that night to send off the soldiers who are laid over in their little town. When her father, the town Constable, (Demarest) bans her from attending, Trudy calls on her oldest friend Norval Jones (Bracken), a 4-F man who has pined after Trudy since they were children, to take her out and act as her decoy while she slips away to the dance. She has a great time that night until a soldier she is dancing with throws her in the air and she knocks her head on a hanging ceiling fixture. When she meets Norval at the rendezvous point, she is acting drunk, but is actually just woozy from bonking her head. As the day progresses, she is relaying the evening to her sister Emmy (Lynn) when she remembers that she got married on a lark, only she has no idea who the husband is. ("It's something with a z? like, Ratzkywatzky") Further complicating things is the fact that she didn't give her real name, and to make matters worse, she later finds out that she's pregnant, so she needs to act fast to either find the father or come up with another solution. She tries to dupe Norval into marrying her, but when she realizes how in love with her he is she can't bring herself to do it. While they are coming up with a solution, Trudy discovers that she is falling in love with Norval herself, so the solution is now to find Ratzkywatzky to divorce him so she can marry Norval.It is amazing to me that "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek", Preston Sturges' film (released in 1944 but filmed in 1942) was able to make it past the Hayes code. The fact that the heroine is a pregnant woman with a dubious marriage was probably unheard of at that point, but Preston Sturges has never been one to shy away from using cleverness and wit to mask what he is really trying to express. The characters in the film are all wacky and exaggerated, but in a very charming way. It's almost like the performances are overdone with a huge wink and a nod. Hutton has great comic timing and flair (the scene in which we are introduced to her character has her lip synching to a record of a below-baritone voiced man that I had to watch twice because I laughed so hard at it). This was one of the first film roles for Eddie Bracken, at the time already a veteran song and dance man from vaudeville, and his portrayal of wormy, tender hearted Norval is both charming and fun.Though my favorite Sturges film remains "Unfaithfully Yours" (1948) he really did a great job on this film, and it has plenty of belly laughs. Films like Sturges', the Marx Brothers, etc. just are not created often anymore, which is too bad. Woody Allen is definitely one successor, but this kind of slapstick, yet intelligent comedy is desperately needed today. Fortunately, I have films like "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek" and others to look back on when I have a yen for comedy, and I recommend that when you do too, you should do the same. 7/10 --Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite having become interested in taking a look at the work of producer/ writer/directing auteur Preston Sturges since reading a detailed review for a box set of his work in Empire magazine,and also having heard about his link to the Coen Brother's movie Oh Brother Where Art Though? a few years ago,I have found myself constantly pushing the chance to take a look at Sturges work for the first time tragically to the side,due to there having always been "just one more" title that I have had to take a look at,before getting the chance to take a glimpse of a Preston Sturges movie.With my dad also having been keen on taking a look at Sturges work,I was thrilled to recently discover that my dad had decide to pick Preston up from the side that he had been permanently waiting for a lift on!,by picking up the Japaneses DVD edition of one of his most well known films,which led to me excitingly getting prepared to discover the miracle of Morgon's Creek for the first time.The plot:Holding a less than secret crush for Trudy Knockenlocker for a number of years,Norval Jones (who has been found unfit for military service) gets the shock of his life,when Tudy reveals to Norval that she will finally go on a date with him to the movies,due to Knocklocker's dad banning his daughter from attending a military party which his being held for solders to bid a fond farewell to their love ones,before they head off on their tour of duty.Dressed in his smartest clothes,Jones finds his and Tudy's walk to the cinema one of the toughest that he has ever taken,due to Knockenlocker openly showing to Norval that she is deeply upset about not being allowed to wave the soldiers goodbye.With having always hated to see Tudy upset,Jones decides to put his feeling for Knockenlocker aside and do a deal with her,where he will go and watch the triple feature that they both were originally meant to see,whilst Tudy can attend the solider's party,and pick up Jones at the end of the night.The next morning:Waking up outside the cinema,an angry Norval is awoken by a loud honking noise that is coming from a badly damaged car being driven by a rather drunk Tudy.Furious over Knockenlocker, (who cant remember anything at all about the events that took place the previous night)Jones decides to get in the car,and drive Tudy back home.As Norval gets closer to her house,Knockenlocker discover's to her horror that she is wearing a wedding ring from a late night marriage,whose groom she is unable to remember the name,and even the face of.View on the film:Filmed at a time when the Hay's Code was in full swing,producer/writer/director Preston Sturges cleverly decides to use the Screwball Comedy elements of his excellent screenplay as a way to hide some incredibly daring twist &amp; turns in the movie's plot,which hark back to the wonderful Pre-Code era of US cinema.Initially making Tudy look like a wholesome,all American girl,Struges gradually peels away Knockenlocker's good gal image,to reveal the character as a wild'n willing party girl.Struges shows Knockenlocker (what a name!) to have a much more masculine personality than the male lead in the movie,by having Knockenlocker go from driving around after a night out partying,to pressing all the right,easy to reach buttons,in getting Noval to agree in helping Tudy to cover up her wild antics.Going against the traditions of the time,Sturges decides to break as many taboos as possible by openly showing drunkenness,single motherhood,and also making a rather risky suggestion that the solider's may not be as clean cut as the town's folk dream of them to be.Expertly balancing the film to make sure that it never falls into becoming self indulgent,Sturges contrast's the controversial story sections of the movie by filling every section of the movie with ribbons of precise,delightfully screwball dialogue which bounces from every corner of the screen,that is also given the chance to breath,thanks to Sturges shooting Tudy &amp; Norval's building relationship in long,elegantly handled tracking shots,which along with allowing Eddie Bracken and Betty Hutton's excellent,subtle performance's to truly shine,also makes the miracle that takes places at Morgan's Creek a wonderful thing to witness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Character acting gone out of control</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There exists not a single film, that I know of, that this one can be compared to. It's a must see for anyone interested in films produced during WWII.This was the first non-singing role for Betty Hutton and her comedic acting displayed a sophisticated sense of timing. Having said that the plot is high camp and the gags are dated (should I say corny?). Still, it's a very interesting film because it trades on familiar stereotypes that became common place during the "golden age of television". It is certainly fascinating that the only "adult" character is the "youngest", the 14 year-old daughter.I must add that William Demarest offered a key performance here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Comedy But Runs Too Long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Miracle of Morgan's Creek" is a first-rate comedy from Director Preston Sturges... it's the story of a girl named Trudy (Betty Hutton) who gets drunk, married &amp; pregnant by a GI who ships off to war the next morning. The problem: she can't even remember his name &amp; now has to face her over-protective cop Father and the judgments of her small-town neighbors.Enter Eddie Bracken as Norval Jones, the goodhearted schlub unfit for military detail who's been in love with Trudy as long as he can remember. The comedy that follows is often hilarious, sometimes repetitive, and only occasionally flat. Great moments include Trudy picking up Norval after her wild night, Norval with Mr. Kockenlocker on the front porch, and Norval's "escape" from prison.This was a very good movie and Eddie Bracken really walked the fine line between comedy and genuine sympathy... my only complaint was that it ran too long, and as a result took one too many plot twists. Otherwise a classy comedy...GRADE: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Comedy of the Silver Screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the better comedies to come out of the 1940s and ranks right up with such comedies like 'Bringing Up Baby' and others. It is about a young man who gets involved with a teenager. When she gets drugged and accidentally marries someone she discovers she shouldn't have done it and wants to marry him. The rest you can watch.I'm surprised this isn't better known, it was such a great movie and has become one of my favorites after watching it. If you ever find it on TV watch it or rent it. Great film10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, dated antique. Great movie for William Demarest fans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was second Lucille Ball, her name was Betty Hutton. The latter's resemblance to the former is uncanny, especially in this movie. As for the movie itself, although there are amusing moments, the movie is woefully dated with a story that's a stretch. But the real star of this movie is William Demarest who gives one of the great performances in a Hollywood movie. Although Eddie Bracken and Betty Hutton got top billing, this movie is a vehicle for William Demarest whose performance outshines that of the other performers. This movie offers an interesting glimpse of Hollywood's impression of the American military personnel circa World War Two. The movie has not aged well, it's story is corny, full of hokum, and suggests an amazing naivet. All the performances are good but the story is simply too weak to make this movie more than just an interesting antique.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't Laugh Once; Didn't even come CLOSE to laughing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a disappointment! I'd been wanting to see "Miracle of Morgan's Creek" for YEARS. I LOVE "Lady Eve" and ESPECIALLY "Sullivan's Travels." But this one I found loud, obnoxious and unfunny. Brian Donlevy as "McGinty" was about the only thing I liked. Oh...and Diana Lynn as the little sister - very droll.The cast is a big part of the problem, I think. Consider the actors in the Sturges movies I love - Barbara Stanwyck, Henry Fonda, the great Joel McCrea; even Veronica Lake was a real talent. I'm sorry, but as far as I can tell, Betty Hutton is just loud and energetic - not funny. (It always makes me so sad that we got stuck with her instead of Judy Garland in "Annie Get Your Gun.") As for Bracken - just unable to carry the film. I love William Demarest in a number of other films, but here he's just loud and even somewhat violent and unpleasant.A lot of the laughs are SUPPOSED to be in the physical comedy - pratfalls, double takes, etc. I never even grinned. The situation, the speed of the movie - I see how they're all POTENTIALLY hilarious. But, for me, it just never happened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy? I doubt it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking at the stellar ratings for this 40's comedy, I thought I check it out. I kept waiting for it to become funny. It doesn't. It just lies there like day old potato salad. William Demarest (uncle Charlie from My 3 Sons) is old and grouchy as usual. Man was this guy ever young? The timeline makes no sense and the characters are all annoying. Also 1940's code is so repressively evident that it just comes across as idiotic, even adjusting for 1940 sensibilities.Rent "Bringing up Baby" or "His Girl Friday" instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatly over-rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film ranks near the top of the most over-rated movies of all time. The script is absurd. There are no laughs in this comedy--unless you think repeated pratfalls are funny. It was a complete waste of Betty Hutton's enormous talent. And you want to strangle Bill Demerest.True, the cast is energetic. The pace is frantic, from beginning to end. One senses a constant presence of the "pep pills" the Judy Garlands and Mickey Rooneys used to live on. The acting is okay. The directing shows skill. And the subject matter, for 1944, was controversial. (Poor Betty didn't know she'd had sex for the first time!) The overall verdict is a screwball movie that went bad. Very bad.Sit all the way through it and see if you can muster a smile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VERY dated comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Preston Sturgis was an excellent writer and director but most of his pictures don't age very well (with the notable exception of Hail the Conquering Hero). Despite this, he is held in VERY high regard by film historians and so my giving this movie a mediocre review is almost like blasphemy (for more such heretical reviews, see my review for Sullivan's Travels).The story is about an immaculate conception. In other words, the main character become pregnant with no supposed outside help. Wow. That's not exactly a deep or well-hashed plot, but that's it. As a result, the jokes seem very forced and the story just never took off for me. Maybe it was a real hoot in 1944, but now it just seems silly---and not in a good way. I give the film 5 stars for the acting and occasional laughs--it's not a BAD film nor is it particularly GOOD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's all the praise for?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm still trying to understand the paper-thin plot to this clunker. Girl lies to father, goes to party, gets drunk, married, and pregnant, then falls for the guy next door.Huh?I had three (and only three) genuine laughs at this so-called classic "screwball comedy." That's probably because I never really cared about any of the characters. Eddie Bracken's Norval came closest to involving me - I can certainly identify with his earnestness and willingness to do almost anything for the girl he loves - but even he mostly left me apathetic.It's not an "old-movie" thing either. I love Casablanca, It's a Wonderful Life, The King and I, and many others. But the real Miracle of Morgan's Creek, in my mind, is that I only had to see it once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lowbrow pablum on steroids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is noisy, frenetic, pitched to those of low IQ and little imagination, taste, sophistication or inclinations to enjoy movies more complex than Three Stooges. The Eddie Bracken character is a highly irritating nerd who oozes. Not sure what he oozes, but he does a lot of oozing. The William Demarest character is shouting much of the time in a most irritating way. Betty Hutton has some charm. I am not sure why anyone would like this movie. This movie never stops to catch its breath. This movie encapsulates everything that is wrong with the Hollywood studio approach to entertainment. Funnier movies were made in the same time period, such as The more the merrier, from 1943. The one word that sums up Morgan Creek is lowbrow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable film but doesn't totally deserve the unquestioning love that is given it in some circles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trudy Kockenlocker feels she is only doing her patriotic duty when she sneaks off the a farewell dance for the young men of Morgan's Creek as they mostly head off to war. However the next morning she turns up drunk and married to boot. The problem is she has no memory of doing anything or who she may have done it with and the only thing she knows for sure is that she is going to be in a lot of trouble in this small town when news gets out ? not to mention the trouble in her own home. Fortunately young Norval Jones (prevented from military service due to his medical condition) is besotted by her and agrees to try and help her out. What could go wrong? This films appears to have much in common with Sturges' Hail, The Conquering Hero, not least of which is the fact that I came to both on the strength of five stars next to it in the Radio Times listings. Also in common is that I was not as impressed as I thought I should be but still enjoyed it as a "watch it once" affair. The narrative is a comedy but it is built on a foundation of showing how small town America is when it comes to certain subjects. Again it has this in common with Hail because it is clear that the film has a satirical edge to it that runs behind everything else ? but both there and here the downside of this is that it is not that sharp or obvious. Indeed with modern eyes it seems very tame indeed, mainly because my cynical generation has not only gotten used to very sharp comedy but also we long since gave up on the idea that anyone was just plain good and homely! What this leaves is a perfectly fine comedy with a good mix of slapstick, screwball stylings and funny dialogue. IMDb tells me that this did show up on Premiere's list of 50 greatest comedies, but that to me smacks of them making sure they have some "classics" in there rather than them actually rolling over it. I might be wrong on that but I do know that I did not find it hilarious and only laughed out loud a couple of times. What it did do though was have me chuckling for the majority. This is driven by the material and the upbeat comic feel the delivery has but also by the cast. Bracken is enjoyable and is another link to Hail (there are many in this cast though). His shy and put upon young man is sympathetic but never pathetic ? an distinction that is important for keeping the viewer on board. Hutton works really well alongside him, particularly with some fast paced dialogue. Demerest is a hoot as her father and most of my laughs were for him. Support is roundly good because mostly they match the tone of the film.I'm not sure of the relationship between Miracle of Morgan's Creek and Hail The Conquering Hero (it looks like they were made back to back) but for me they both have similar problems when watching now. The relevance and impact of the background is less important to the viewer and does feel dated. The comedy is good without being brilliant, leaving an enjoyable film that is worth seeing as long as you take the gushing praise to be more representative of the film's place in history rather than how the casual viewer will find it today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You have to suspend belief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In reference to another reviewers comment: "After all, Trudy only wanted to do the best for the boys going to a war where most of them wouldn't come back alive." Fact is less than 3% of soldiers (mostly army) would die. (Less that 2% of those that served died in actual combat.) Apparently Trudy may have had multiple partners. Or was it what we might now call 'date rape'? And if Trudy were driving impaired (not her car so probably uninsured) today, we'd probably not think it very funny either. But the by gone days of WW II, you can drink unsweetened lemonade (diluted lemon juice), hit your head, have sex, get a man to raise another man's children, and it's all in fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this recently on a wide screen. Came in with high hopes -- based on Sturges' reputation and memories of laughing my head off at The Lady Eve. Soon found myself waiting for gags and slapstick instead of following the inscrutable plot. the players' so-hyped-up-it's-inert delivery didn't help either. Bottom line: needlessly long joke-y vignette with maudlin punchline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had great actors but the subject matter really bothered me. It is an old movie so I was shocked it showcased a young lady from a good family getting "into trouble" and becoming pregnant and needing a husband to "save her." Yes she was married on a whim to a man she didn't even remember, but she had to drag an innocent man into the situation to marry her and give her babies a name. There are enough people in the world without morals in the world and I hate seeing it showcased in the guise of an innocent sweet movie. I'm sorry I saw it. Perhaps those of you that aren't bothered by this sort of thing may enjoy it but I will not watch it again.</fullReview>
