		<shortDescription>Fun comedy about three confirmed bachelor dads</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a really cute, light hearted comedy. The plot may be pretty unrealistic, the ending kooky &amp; unbelievable, and don't get your morals from it, but all in all...it's great fun to watch.The story revolves around three carefree bachelors (Peter, Michael, and Jack) who share a New York City apartment. All are busy with their jobs, girlfriends, and social lives and have no intention of settling down anytime soon. While actor Jack is away shooting a movie, a baby is left outside their apartment door with a note indicating that this is Jack's child from an affair with his co star (though he's previously been unaware of this offspring's existence). His two room mates mistakenly believe that they are to deliver the baby to a couple of men who appear at the door asking for 'a package'. Right before they are about to hand the baby over, they realize these men are drug dealers. Then the bachelors have to contend with the baby's care as well as the drug dealers' demands for payment.The three bachelors are played by famous name stars...Tom Sellick (Peter, the architect), Steve Guttenberg (Michael, the artist), and Ted Danson (Jack, the actor). Their considerable talents and playboyish charisma have a lot to do with this movie's success. The unlikely trio must learn to juggle the demands of baby care with their careers and social lives. It's really fun to watch them in all the stereotypical hilarious circumstances of diapering and baby tending. The men's paternal instincts come into play and the bachelors grow quite attached to the little tyke.Directed by Leonard Nimoy (Spock, my favourite), this is a generally light, mindless, and entertaining movie that shows how these three 'hunks' &amp; confirmed bachelors are won over by little baby Mary. Switch your brain into neutral and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"3 Men and a Baby" is a comedy that's cute and funny. Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenberg, and Ted Danson star as three bachelors who live together, and who's lives are changed forever when on one particular day a baby infant is left on their doorstep. The three bachelors are now forced unexpectedly to become fathers to the baby. Plenty of wonderful comedy scenes throughout as the three stars go through the frustrations of having to deal with this infant girl in the early stages, then the baby eventually starts to win them over. If only the filmmakers threw out the subplot involving drugs, then this film would've been a great comedy. *** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three bachelors have their lives flipped upside down when little baby Mary is left on their doorstep.A remake of successful 1985 French film Three Men And A Cradle, this Hollywood version took the box office by storm to make a domestic profit of over $155,000,000. It's not hard to see why really. Yes it looks a touch twee now, and the irritating drug-smuggling sub-plot (also in the original) grows more tiresome with subsequent revisits. Yet it has a frothy cleanness so lacking in many more similar big budgeted movies that came after it. Starring Tom Selleck, Ted Danson and Steve Guttenberg as the "no parenting skills" bachelors, Leonard Nimoy's film , (yes, Spock) sees quality interplay between the guys and some bona fide funny sequences as they in turn attempt to do right by Mary. Yep it's all telegraphed comedy, and the ending holds no surprises for anyone once Nancy Travis as Mary's mother comes back to claim the child. But come on folks, three beefy bachelors trying to change diapers and entertain a wailing baby has to be charming; surely? 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eighties classic still holds it's own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Until last night if someone had asked me about Three Men and A Baby, I would have said...oh great movie, classic eighties I loved it! Well, it being one of my wife's all time favourites she insisted we watched it and now I'm convinced that it might have been the first time I've seen it all the way through. It is a fun, madcap adventure that's only problem is that with time it has become a little predictable. However, that doesn't make it any less fun and it certainly presents the best possible of "baby changing bachelor(s) life" and "inept new father's taking care of baby." Its not a new concept, we've seen it time and time again even on Television but this is still an 80's classic thanks to chemistry of the cast, a solid story and simple fun. Only an eighties movie could mix together the new father angle with drug dealers and a thriller type ending in a construction building. A great 80's film in my opinion encompasses and shows off everything we loved about the 80's and this film does that. Success, gluttony (but in a good way), free love, spirit, bright bold and sassy with a touch of gaudiness and you will see all of that in Three Men and a Baby. It also is unique in the fact that it really isn't a family film, it really was geared to adults making it a unique comedy in that way.I could start with any of the main three guys but I will start with my favourite, the unbeatable Mr. Tom Selleck. He's handsome, he's suave, he's an incredibly versatile actor and he was at his prime in this film. His chemistry is palpable and you can see it at every turn. He is a scene stealer just by being Tom Selleck. You can't hardly make an adult 80's comedy without Steve Guttenberg. You can make fun of him, and you can point out he is always the same character but you can't deny he commands attention in 80's comedies. He has a down to earth style that you really like and he's good in this. I happen to think that he gets downplayed because of Selleck and Ted Danson but he is still a welcome member of the cast and has great comedic timing. Ted Danson basically plays Sam Malone in this film. He is absent for almost half the movie and his character has a much faster story than the other two guys but he is still a necessary part to the three men aspect. You can't deny the three of them have great chemistry and they all have at least one great scene between them that will make you laugh, smile or feel all warm and fuzzy. I can't say a lot for the supporting cast, they are all good but they do nothing more than support the three guys. Even our "villains" are mostly just run of the mill bad guys that don't really shine in their roles but they are completely adequate.I was nearly bowled over when I saw Leonard Nimoy directed this film. I just had no idea that he did anything like this as a director. He does a very good job. He keeps the script simple and he lets his three stars do what they do best. All three of them were 80's TV and movie heavyweights so you just let them do what they do and it works. The movie is fun and light, cute and weepy at times but it just hits the right chords. No one will ever say its a brilliant feat of film making but the fun and entertainment factor is without a doubt high! If you love 80's then you have to see this of course, and moreso if you want a light fun comedy then look no further because this will fill the void!! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad! Quite funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It turned out to be a good idea after all. I actually liked this movie since I have seen it years ago. I can't remember until now the appeal. It's actually cute and well-done without any real nonsense. It actually makes sense when you watch it. It is actually entertaining without overdoing it. It's a great family movie too. There are hilarious moments between the men and baby Mary. I only wished she had a better name than Mary. The cast is first rate with Tom Selleck, Ted Danson, and Steve Gutenberg as the three fathers and Nancy Travis as British Sylvia. I love seeing Celeste Holm playing grandmother to baby Mary even if it was for only a moment. They have quite a ball with baby Mary in their lives even though she was a surprise beyond belief. Baby Mary usually steals the scene because of her beauty. Babies are beautiful and fun but lots of work for one parent, much less two or three or four parents. I won't give away the ending but I think they should have filmed it in New York City rather in Toronto but that's just my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three men and a baby is a good example of a feel-good comedy/drama. The cast is big named with stars like Steve Guttenburg, Tom Selleck, and Ted Danson as three bachelors living in an apartment (with a ghost) who gets a baby at their doorstep. I think that that's pretty creative. Leonard Nimoy aka Spock directs this and it is good.Overall the movie is a good feel-good comedy and I enjoyed it. Look for the boy in the window. the ghost. Rating 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THREE MEN AND A BABY is one of the big beasts of Hollywood cinema of the 1980s. It's a simple story, one that's well executed by Leonard Nimoy in one of his forays behind the camera, and truth be told there's little to dislike about it as a film. It's basically Steve Guttenberg, Ted Danson, and Tom Selleck in an apartment looking after a baby.You can guess the easy, laid back nature of the film in this film and it really is an easy viewing experience. Even a mildly suspenseful crime style sub-plot added to the proceedings never endangers the characters much or adds much in the way of real danger to the story. The three main actors are all charismatic and you can easily see why women would fall in love with them, although it's worth noting that the baby is the real scene stealer here.THREE MEN AND A BABY frequently threatens to veer into cheesy sentimentality, particularly at the climax, but that it never becomes too overwhelming is testament to its success as a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Architect Peter Mitchell (Tom Selleck) has an ex in Rebecca (Margaret Colin). Michael Kellam (Steve Guttenberg) is a sensitive cartoonist. Jack Holden (Ted Danson) is a playboy actor. The three bachelors happily share a Manhattan penthouse with a long line of women coming in and out. Then somebody leaves a baby at their doorstep. A note indicates that Mary is the result of an union between Jack and Sylvia (Nancy Travis). Jack is away doing a TV movie. Peter and Michael are forced to deal with the baby. Jack has a package of drugs delivered to the apartment which is to be picked up by two men. Peter and Michael mistakenly assume the baby to be the package. Narcotics officer Sgt. Melkowitz (Philip Bosco) come to question the guys.The combination of the three stars makes this work. Selleck is terrific. This has good comedy and some awkward stuff. I can do without the heroin. It takes the movie down a dark alley. The tone is completely wrong. I would have liked more with Rebecca and Sylvia doesn't need to be British. Overall, it's a mix bag with some laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie with high hopes based on the three stars. I mean Tom Selleck, Ted Danson and Steve Guttenberg are all funny in their own right and I figured the three together would be really funny. I was a bit disappointed. I do figure it was the writing and the directing since I have seen all three guys perform a lot better. The whole premise that three roommates would date the same woman is not too far fetched for the 70's-80', what is a little hard to believe though is that all three "slept" with her with in enough of a time period so that any one of them could be the baby's father. I guess DNA matching was still not reliable when this movie was shot. All in all though it was fairly funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three Old-Timers And An Average Comedy - 61%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having reacquainted myself with this implausible Eighties classic this afternoon, there were a number of things that took me by surprise. The first surprise was the director, Leonard "Spock" Nimoy, who I imagine felt quite out of his depth when he directed something as polar opposite to "Star Trek" as this. The second was recalling a time when actors like Tom Selleck, Ted Danson and Steve Guttenberg was seriously big-time stars. I also had no idea it was a remake of a French original, also making this the most successful US remake of a French film in history. The last thing that surprised me was given the high esteem this movie is held in was how largely forgettable, implausible and not especially entertaining the whole thing was. It has flashes of brilliance but sadly, these are all too infrequent.Selleck, Danson and Guttenberg are three bachelors living the high life in a New York apartment. When actor Jack (Danson) flies off to Turkey for filming, artist Michael (Guttenberg) and architect Peter (Selleck) are left to hold the fort when, unexpectedly, a baby appears on their doorstep - apparently belonging to Jack. As their lives begin falling apart at the seams trying to care for little Mary, things take a turn for the ugly when hoodlums turn up to pick up another package of Jack's from Turkey - smuggled heroin.The impression I got watching "Three Men And A Baby" was that it wasn't enough having the three leads fannying about Mary who cries, gurgles and coos about as often as possible. So the whole drug sub-plot was crudely shoved into place to give the film some momentum but by doing this, it nearly completely wrecked the film for me. None of it felt the slightest bit believable and aside from Selleck and Guttenberg, most of the characters were fairly unlikeable. As for those two, the only real difference between them is that Selleck is much hairier and that's it. Even Mary's mother (Nancy Travis) wasn't particularly sympathetic and to be frank, I wanted to give Social Services a call to come in and take poor Mary off the pair of them. However, this film is not a complete loss. There are some good bits in there (I quite enjoyed Selleck's scene in the supermarket trying to buy the right stuff) and Mary herself (played jointly by infant sisters Lisa &amp; Michelle Blair) is very watchable, as most babies are. It's just a shame that it went off the rails in the middle because I didn't feel that the movie needed any further pushing towards its typically sugar-coated climax.Assuming that you can stand the enormous retro-trip this movie puts you on, I'm struggling to see why new viewers should seek out "Three Men And A Baby". I suppose it's nice to see a baby-centred film that doesn't rely too much of comedic slapstick (I'm thinking primarily of "Baby's Day Out" here) but a bit more comedy and a little less drama might have helped its cause. Such as it is, this movie remains little more than a pleasant time-passer even if you can see what will happen come the end. Selleck, Danson and Guttenberg are perfectly competent actors who also possess decent comic timing but making movies such as this was never likely to launch any of them into the stratosphere and before long, two of them were heading into sitcoms while Guttenberg pretty much disappeared altogether. I wonder if the French original is any better...Oh and merry Christmas everyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, all men are incapable of handling one small child.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, if we are to believe this movie men who do not have a female present have absolutely no idea how to raise a baby are do anything. Not only is this child left in the care of one guy, but three all of which have no clue how to raise a baby and are completely lost, so all three roommates were only children are had no younger siblings to take care of. If this is the case then you can easily title this movie Three women and a baby as they would be just as lost in that scenario as a guy would be, but for some reason people think women just magically know what to do and men are idiots when it comes to children. The three idiots in question here are Tom Selleck and Ted Danson, known mainly for television work and Steve Guttenberg known mainly for being really lucky to have a Hollywood career. This film is also known for starring a cardboard cutout of a boy who was supposedly a ghost of some kid who blew his brains out by accident in the apartment where this film was shot even though all interior shots of the place were on a set. One has to wonder how much of this movie's success came from the story and how much came from idiots who wanted to see this movie cause they thought there was a ghost in it. In the end, this film is like a long list of crappy films that have babies and idiots raising them and for me it was not very good. I like Ted Danson, but he is basically doing his Sam Malone here, in fact in every movie he was in during this era he was usually in Sam Malone character. However, he is the best thing in the movie and has the funniest moments while Selleck and Guttenberg play lame clueless idiots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Accurately funny comedy about two swinging bachelors who are left stranded with a little baby girl which they are forced to look after.Leonard Nimoy's film (based on the French hit "Three Men and a Cradle") is spot on with its humour as it details the misadventures of the two men as they struggle to feed, wash and contain the noisy child. Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenberg and Ted Danson are a good team and the subplot fills in time quite nicely.When it starts to get sentimental, the film does weaken a little, however for the most part this is a comedy worth your while. Also starred Nancy Travis.Sunday, February 21, 1993 - T.V.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am sick of hearing stories about this so called 'ghost'. I mean it's a cardboard cutout, people are so dumb to think that there's a ghost in the movie. movie editors would have noticed it and took it out of the movie. I can tell you that the boy staring at the camera frigging' scared the crap out of me. Since we're on the topic of cardboard, Ted Dansons character on a cutout can be seen twice, once by the window, and another time when the apartment gets destroyed.About the movie, it's funny, it's probably my favorite movie, when i watch it i just cover my eyes when that freaking cardboard piece-of-crap jumps out at me. I recommend this movie. It's a nice,mild comedy.E-mail me if you have a story about you this piece of cardboard.</fullReview>

Their combined talents and charisma have a lot to do with this movie's success. This film was nearly perfect, but sadly still not made for everyone. It's an important film, as well as very entertaining. It is very light-hearted. It's fun to see the three guys in all the stereotypical circumstances of diapering and baby tending. I finished this film, thinking, "There are people out there suffering and I can do something to help them out!" Great performances help to enhance this story of friendship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obviously rumors that rumors are false are false</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "rumor" that the boy in the background of one of the scenes in the movie is a cardboard cutout is indeed false. I have carefully studied the scene in question and it resembles no Ted Danson and if watched very carefully the "cutout's" eyes follow Jack and his mother as they walk across the room. The so-called expose' pics of the boy are an inaccurate depiction. The scene never cuts away and the boy is better viewed when to the right of Jack and his mother, not the left as the pictures I've seen depict. Another excuse to the "gun" in the scene is that it is the side view of the cutout. This also is explainable. If you examine closely you will see that when to the right of Jack and his mother the gun and the boy are both at their frontal views. The gun and the boy never coexist within the scene. These public skeptic's explanations are simply to blow off publicity that the mother of the child did not desire. She believe the film makers were making a mockery of her sons death so they agreed to make public announcements that the boy was a prank and a fake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Changed Her Diapers. She Changed Their Lives.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Meet Peter Mitchell, Michael Kellam and Jack Holden, three roommates living together in a penthouse apartment in New York City. Peter is an architect, Jack is an actor and Michael is an artist. He painted pictures all around the hallway. Jack would be flying to Turkey to do a movie. After he left he called Michael and Peter and told them a package would be arriving that day and said for them to just put it aside until some guys come to pick it up. Returning home from jogging, Peter notices a cradle on the doorstep. Inside is a baby! Michael finds a note that's addressed to Jack and it's from Sylvia. The men think the baby was the package. Her name was Mary. Peter ran out to buy baby food and diapers while Michael struggled to entertain her right as a small package was delivered to him by the superintendant, Mrs. Hathaway. When Peter returned, he and Michael struggle to change Mary's diaper. They continue to take care of the baby, putting their lives on hold. One day two guys came by to collect the package. Michael and Peter, thinking the baby was the package, gave her to the guys. Peter then discovered the real package, which was full of drugs! He got the baby back, luckily, but now the cops were involved. Peter came home one day to find the apartment trashed. Mary was okay, though. Jack soon returned and Peter and Michael were very angry at him for putting them through all that. Jack explained he was holding the drugs for his director friend. Michael and Peter then introduce him to his daughter. It took some time but Jack soon became a father figure. The men soon got a message from the crooks, telling them to meet with the "stuff". They met at a construction site. Michael and Peter went up while Jack was at the power controls. Michael was to videotape the crooks while Peter did the talking. Michael was soon discovered and they jump into the elevators so Jack, thinking quick, cut the power to the one the crooks were in. The police arrived and took them to jail. So life was finally getting back to normal. Jack, Michael and Peter became ideal fathers for Mary. Then one day, Sylvia showed up to take Mary with her to live in England. The men follow her to the airport to stop her, so she changed her mind and decided to move in with Peter, Michael and Jack offered to let her so they became one big, happy family and lived happily ever after.  A pretty good movie. It pairs Tom Selleck (Folks!, Quigley Down Under), Steve Guttenberg (Cocoon, Police Academy) and Ted Danson (TV's Cheers, Getting Even With Dad). They were all good together! Three Men and a Baby was followed by 3 Men and A Little Lady. Same actors. I haven't seen it, but I'm sure it's good. This movie is directed by Leonard Nimoy. You may know him as Mr. Spock from Star Trek. So anyway, if you're a fan of Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenberg and/or Ted Danson, I recommend Three Men and a Baby! It's good. The beginning is a little slow, but it slowly but surely begins to pick up.-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that stinks as bad as Mary's nappies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>3 Men and a Baby was the No 1 box-office smash hit of 1987. Although why that is is anyone's guess. It may have been because of an urban legend that surrounds the film. A ghost boy appears in the background of one particular shot. You need only browse this site's trivia section to find the details behind that. Its only a cardboard cutout of Ted Danson. There does seem something rather ludicrous about a myth fabricated by the public proving to be the selling-point of a film. And yet it worked. In ways beyond the filmmakers wildest dreams.Lucky for them. Because there's nothing particularly brilliant about the rest of the film. In fact you can almost sense the filmmakers cold feet with the whole baby angle, since they include a clumsy and completely ham-fisted drugs subplot. Almost as if they sensed the baby wasn't a strong enough story to sustain the film on its own. Which says all there is to say about 3 Men and a Baby.If it weren't for that whole marketing ploy about the so-called ghost boy, something tells me 3 Men and a Baby would not have been the box-office winner that it was. The film is made up of two disjointed plots that never gel together, no matter how hard it tries. And the film follows the dictates of formula right to the letter. You can almost imagine the screen writing sessions, pitching they're ideas:"One of three guys fathers a baby he never knew about. The mother dumps her on they're doorstep. Wouldn't it be great if daddy's out of town at the time, leaving the other two hapless schmucks minding the baby. Cue lots of diaper changes. Crying. Goo-gooing. And what about this, a drugs angle to make things even more exciting than they already are? Once that's dealt with, the three guys realise they do love this little bundle of joy after all! And then Mommy comes back to really shake things up. I think we've got a genuine classic on our hands here. Let's get this baby into production."Its times like this I fear for the future of film-making if this is the best they can churn out. 3 Men and a Baby is one of the most overrated comedies ever to hit cinemas. The fact it filled out so many theatre seats is beyond belief. A much better baby film of 1987 was the superb Coen comedy Raising Arizona. Now that was a comedy classic!I'm hard-pressed to think of a single thing about the film that does work. The Blair twins who play Baby Mary are certainly adorable enough, but the film surrounding her is so routine and eminently predictable. There are all the usual hallmarks. Director Leonard Nimoy (Mr Spock!) ticks them all off like he were filling out a check-list. The sleepless nights. The nappy changes. And poop jokes. Lots and lots of poop jokes. Or doodling as its called here for some strange, bizarre reason.After Nimoy demonstrated such a deft hand for comedy in the previous year's Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, its surprising he fumbles it so badly here. Even the title is a bit misleading. For half the film, Ted Danson is completely absent. Leaving it to Tom Selleck and Steve Guttenberg to carry the load in his absence.Tom Selleck can certainly be a charismatic and likable leading man. Any episode of Magnum will tell you that. But he often looks a bit uncomfortable in the role of a care-free bachelor forced to develop a softer side through a baby. I think everyone (including Selleck) was expecting 3 Men and a Baby to be the film that would launch his movie career. Except it didn't happen. Despite numerous TV appearances and the occasional film role, Tom Selleck has almost completely vanished from the Hollywood circuit.The same goes for Steve Guttenberg, even more so. I was never really much of a fan of Guttenberg. Although he carved out a modest career for himself in the 80s, he is hardly what you would call a truly gifted comic actor. He coasted for far too long on the Police Academy series. Had a couple of outside hits with the likable Short Circuit and the endearing Cocoon, but his career didn't survive the transition to the 90s. The decline of his career has been steeper than Selleck's. He's now reduced to appearing in TV movies. Usually of the Christmas kind.Ted Danson is the only one to have had any kind of career beyond 3 Men and a Baby. Showing his natural talent for comedy in Cheers and Becker, Danson is one of Hollywood's greatly underrated comedians. But the film doesn't give him much of a chance to show off his considerable talent for comedy since it sidelines him for most of it.3 Men and a Baby is miscalculated on all counts. A lot of the comedy falls flat. The dramatic scenes come out mawkish, e.g. violin music plays when Mary's mum Sylvia (Nancy Travis with a very convincing British accent) comes to take her away. And the film is an odd blend of a light plot and a dark one. You can tell Leonard Nimoy backed himself into a corner with that drugs subplot, as he goes out of his way to wrap it up in the quickest way possible in a hurried and utterly unconvincing showdown at a construction site. All the actors look itchy and restless. As if they're as eager as Nimoy to wrap this thing up.Things end predictably with Mary being accepted, Sylvia joining the family, and all live happily ever after. 3 Men and a Baby is not quite as dire as its sequel, but it still falls far short of classic status. Funny that an unfounded rumour would have such a positive effect on a movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sick of this Ghost Boy rubbish...I like the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ugh! I'm so sick of these 'Ghost Boy' stories and laugh my butt off everytime I hear another stupid story about it. The supposed phantom situated in Jack's bedroom was in fact a freakin cardboard cut out of Ted Danson. You see the same cut-out next to the window in a later scene.I would like to go into the whole 'it's a friggin SET, and not a REAL apartment' rant, but I won't.Now for the film, which I thought was cute and funny. This was the 80's remember when cute, funny, comedy romps like this were very popular. Never saw the French version, and don't wish to. These type of movies aren't to my taste anymore but for the time it was a harmless, funny and charming tale directed by Leonard 'it's life Jim but not as we know it' Nimoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I own this charming film on VHS tape. It's been a while since I've seen it, but I remember it with tender and life-affirming pleasure. Indeed, it is a lightweight, somewhat implausible Hollywood comedy with three impossibly well-off, comely, and well-adjusted bachelors in a cavernous apartment (imagine the rent). But Selleck, Guttenburg, and Danson earn their laughs (although I fould the latter just a tad stiff) and after cherubic baby Mary enters their lives, they earn our hearts. During the middle of the film after the drug dealers have tied up the babysitter, trashed the apartment looking for the heroin, and left the baby in a closet with threats to return, when Selleck finds the baby and says, "Nobody is going to hurt you, nobody is going to hurt you", despite the unsavory drug plot, the movie grabs you in its caring but firm embrace. When Mary's mother returns for the baby after abandoning her on the doorstep, at first you want to condemn her. But when she tearfully explains to the trio why she did it, I think you forgive her. "Three Men and a Baby" demonstrates that the simple love of an adult for an infant is enough for a compelling story and will more than compensate for an awkwardly shoe-horned subplot and even Danson's (Mary's biological father's) negligence.There's a vital place on this planet for "feel-good" movies like "Three Men and a Baby".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star-power highlights this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ted Danson, Tom Selleck, and Steve Guttenberg star in this light- hearted comedy about how 3 New York bachelors receive a big change in their lives after finding a baby on their doorstep. With humor that primarily surround the ordeal the 3 men have to contend with, 3 MEN AND A BABY relies on the chemistry the 3 main stars generate witheach other. At first they experience dismay with the infant; I mean, how can three unmarried men take care of a baby?! But soon enough the 3 guys fall in love with her. But with good measure, a drug- smuggling subplot is thrown in (probably to make it not look like your a typical family-oriented comedy). Nevertheless, Danson, Selleck, and Guttenberg shine. The same goes for the cute little baby Mary, and agood direction from an unlikely director, Leonard "Mr. Spock" Nimoy himself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a remake of a wonderful French movie, Trois hommes et un couffin, by director Coline Serreau. When the French version have charm, this Hollywood massacre becomes boring. It's not the first time that Americans try to catch the French humor of great French films. A lot of Pierre Richard films have this treatment. So is Nikita and a lot of others. Every time, it's a disaster. So, please, if you really want to see a funny and creative movie, go see Coline Serreau version. I give one out of ten for this, and 10 out of 10 for the French version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Three Men and a Baby" is one of those movies like "Ghostbusters" that you enjoy in spite of the fact that you realize that they are only made for money and are otherwise empty. I saw this about three times when it was new and laughed like a loon each time. A couple of days ago, I saw a dubbed version on Czech TV. This time, only a few of the jokes made me laugh such as the drug hiding jokes, the scenes of the three roomies being obviously outside of their element with the baby and that masterpiece of a scene where Tom Selleck tells off the pompous Hungarian celloist (I always loved that one). Otherwise, the only other entertainment value is provided by the "goofball with a heart of gold" appeal of the three lead actors and a cute little baby for the more sentimental viewers. One thing which struck me though was just how garishly the 80s the music and the fashions were ! When people think "good 1980s music", they usually think of new wave and some of the better hard rock stuff. The music here, though, is exactly the kind of sugary drivel that is best left forgotten. And the fashions, of course, make everyone look like either a "Miami Vice" fan or an ultra clean cut Young Republican. "Three Men and a Baby" is a genuine artifact in this sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite the Flaws It's Still Very Funny and Charming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>3 Men and a Baby (1987) *** (out of 4) Remake of a French movie about three bachelors (Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenberg, Ted Danson) whose lives are turned upside down when one of their former lovers drops off a baby girl at their door. Soon the three men have to put their lives on hold while they try and figure out the way to take care of a baby. 3 MEN AND A BABY was one of the biggest hits of the decade and it's easy to see why because it just has crowd pleaser written all over it. That's certainly not to say that it's the perfect movie because there are way too many flaws for that but in the end there's no denying that there are plenty of laughs and all sorts of cuteness. I think the weakest part of the film is an entire subplot dealing with some heroin being dropped off at the boy's apartment and them unknowingly getting involved with a bunch of crooks. Revisiting the film after so many years had me rather shocked at how much time is actually spent on this and it simply should have been cut. I know this happened in the original movie but when you're dealing with laughs and charm some of this stuff just goes over-the-top and all the time spent on it just takes away from the men and the baby. The film is at its strongest when the screenplay just lets the men do their thing. Selleck, Guttenberg and Danson all have their own style of comedy and the film greatly benefits when they're allowed to just do their thing. Selleck is certainly the strongest of the group but he is the lead and given the majority of the strong stuff including a hilarious bit inside a store when he's trying to figure out what type of food to get the baby. Guttenberg is also extremely effective with the child and this gives the film a lot of its charm. Twin girls were used for the part of the baby and even though they didn't have to "act", the child is so cute and adorable you can't help but fall in love with her just as the three men are doing in the movie. Again, this film is far from flawless but at the same time it's hard to not get sucked into the story and bowled over with its charm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoroughly enjoyable and funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was actually surprised at how much I liked 3 Men and a Baby. I agree there are some hit-and-miss moments, and it does start off slowly, but a vast majority of it is very funny and enjoyable. The story is simple, three bachelors find a baby on the doorstep and before long they are knee-deep in bottles, nappies and goo. No matter how simple this story is it is effective too.Leonard Nimoy's direction adeptly keeps the entertainment and comedy afloat and it comes thick and fast, while the script has plenty of funny and engaging moments. The film is very nice visually, especially loved that apartment, and the music is good enough. The acting I had little problem with either, Ted Danson, Steve Guttenberg and Tom Selleck show great chemistry together and deliver great performances individually as each of their characters get increasingly harassed while adapting to changing, feeding and burping duties, and the baby was very cute.All in all, very enjoyable and fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic family movie with a dark urban myth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the late 80's this was the family comedy by excellence. I mean, it aired regularly on many channels and to be honest, it's a funny but naive movie that had a premise that was very popular at the time; making a baby or infant being the center of the plot.Tom Selleck is great as always and delivers a fine comedic performance. The situations are funny mainly because it demonstrates how a bunch of macho men are able to take care of a baby. Well, that's all you have to know about the plot.The dark urban myth is well known by everybody and I won't get into details about it, or I won't even discuss if it's real or a hoax. The truth is that the "moment" is creepy as hell and makes this family movie a creepy experience for a moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three Men and a Baby</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard enough about this film, and I was certainly not going to miss it when the opportunity came along, from director Leonard Nimoy (Spock from Star Trek). Basically bachelors Peter 'Pete' Mitchell (Magnum, P.I.'s Tom Selleck), Michael 'Mike' Kellam (Police Academy's Steve Guttenberg) and Jack Holden (Cheers' Ted Danson) share an apartment in Manhattan. Actor Jack goes away to film in Turkey, and Pete and Mike find a baby, Mary (twins Lisa and Michelle Blair), left on their doorstep, with a note that it's Jack's from a woman named Sylvia. They are convinced it's a package Jack was expecting, and realise they have to look after it, changing diapers, feeding and entertaining it. They eventually realise the package is in fact some drugs, and when Jack gets back Pete and Mike refuse to help him, since it's his kid. After thwarting the gangster bust that Jack is involved in, the three men spend more time with baby Mary (shown in a montage). After a little while, English Sylvia (Nancy Travis) shows up wanting to take the baby back, taking it with her to the airport, which the boys try and stop, but in the end she can't face taking the baby away from them, and needs help, so they all move in together, a happy ending. Also starring Celeste Holm as Mrs. Holden, Philip Bosco as Det. Sgt. Melkowitz, Derek De Lint as Jan Clopatz, Paul Guilfoyle as Vince, Alexandra Amini as Patty, Cynthia Harris as Mrs. Hathaway, Claire Cellucci as Angelyne, Michelle Duquet as Tawnya, Earl Hindman as Satch, Jackie Richardson as Edna, John Gould Rubin as Paul Milner, Camilla Scott as Cherise, Sharolyn Sparrow as Vanessa, Louise Vallance as Sally, Jonathon Whittaker as Adam and A Bug's Life's Dave Foley as Grocery Store Clerk. Selleck, Guttenberg and Danson each get their equal amount of laughs, the baby situations they encounter are all both adorable and funny, the drug dealing plot perhaps slows things, but overall it is a charming and great comedy that may get men thinking twice about having kids. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Card board cutout-</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK. I read the whole arguing thread and I have a new twist. I saw the movie in the theater in 87' with two friends of mine. We saw a boy in the scene in question crouch from one set of curtains and scoot to the other set of curtains containing the Ted Danson cutout. We walked out of the theater and laughed about it saying how we couldn't believe that they missed this "goof" letting a kid on stage or something.Fast forward two years and everyone is talking about a ghost in the movie. We felt at the time we knew what they were talking about as we had seen it. But when we rented the video what we saw was not there??? It had been cut out from the movie. Just the stupid cutout of Ted Danson that they show earlier in the movie more clearly and everyone seems intent to argue over. These two guys are still good friends of mine and I'm glad they were there because I believe we saw the real ghost or a kid on the lot and they saw it with me. We talk about it all the time.I don't know why they wouldn't leave it in, but my guess is, a ghost to argue about makes more $$$$True story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I relate to this movie totally</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie was in theaters, I took my older two children at the time, My son was 11 and my daughter was 7. At home I had a brand new set of twins that were little over one year old, a boy and a girl. My older two children got good grades on their report cards and they earned a day at the movies, big lunch and an unrestricted time at a video arcade. They had a blast and when we all saw the movie, it touched me all the way to the core. I am 6'4" and 250lbs and when Tom Selleck was running through the house looking for little Mary after those drug dealer trashed his place sent my stomach up to my throat. A few tear ran down my face and from that point on till today, this movie is one of my favorites of all time. Maybe its because I am a father that takes raising my kids seriously. Or its seeing three bumbling guys trying to take care of one baby and I have always taken care of my all 4 of my children, a lot of times on my own. What ever the reason is, I don't know, but the original nature of this film makes it a real hit in my book. I watched it again just last night on cable and again it touched me like it was the first time. It just brings me back to the time when my grown children were babies, especially when all of them are grown now. Again its in my top ten!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A feel-good movie, ideal for a mushy night in ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know. Maybe it's what I was brought up on: Rainbow, Jamie &amp; The Magic Torch, Knight Rider ... but I could watch "3 Men and a Baby" a million times and STILL laugh at the funny bits, and cry at the sad or "mushy" bits. All I know is that you have to be a real cynic not to just kick back and let it carry you away for an hour and a half. By the way, I've been a technical support analyst, web/graphic designer and am now a software developer, so I'm NOT easily impressed.Now I know that the US has had the unfortunate habit of taking some foreign classics and rendering them unrecognisable, but not so here. The characters HAD to be played by Selleck, Guttenberg and Danson, simply because they're recognisable from their Magnum, Cadet Mahoney and Sam Malone roles (respectively), all of whom (incidentally) are synonymous with the "macho, womanising bachelor" lifestyle - THAT'S what make 'em believable here, and thus makes the film work so well. Like my erstwhile colleague observed, you could well believe that Selleck was about to pull out a grand any minute to avoid changing nappies.I'm a fan of a GOOD Euro-to-UK/US-remake; since I have no real-world knowledge of world languages nor their dialects, I often have to resort to reading the subtitles on foreign films, which detracts and distracts from the action on screen, such as facial expressions, body language, etc. But I'd put up with it if it's a good film. However, my wife detests subtitles, so the only way to get her to watch some of these classics is to watch the English/American remake: I for one can't wait for someone with a passion for world cinema to make a comparable version of Amelie, so my Babylove can grow to love it the way I did the original! But I digress... sorry...At the end of the day, 3M&amp;AB beat the pants off "Look Who's Talking" (ALL episodes). To all you cynics (sorry, critics) out there, try curling up with your partners on the sofa on a Friday night with this in the DVD or video, and see that I'm right ...(NB - I originally posted this comment on 01-Feb-2001 as IronFan, which I've since deleted)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was good, I loved the plot and I thought that Steve Guttenberg was not just taking up space, after all he was the artist (I'm an artist). I found it much better than it's sequel, "Three Men and a Little Lady" or it's spin off "Full House". Although I found the ghost component of the movie kind of creepy. In the scene where Jack's mother visits the baby for the first time, there is a boy behind the drapes staring straight at the camera. According to an article I read, the apartment that the used for the movie was the same apartment that the landlady's son killed himself in. In some scenes later apparently you see the gun that he used and no one on the set was aware of it. I never saw the gun but I sure as heck saw the boy. It was not seen through editing, and nobody saw it in the theaters but according to the article, the mother bought the videotape and when she saw it she said it was definitely him. I guess it proves that perhaps all those claims of ghosts showing up in photographs were true, you want proof, buy the videotape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The bowels of Hades</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once the opening credits sequence began, complete with the "Boys will be boys" pop song perfectly capturing and defining the wholesome, cutesy, Hollywood concept behind this movie, I knew that I was in for a tough, bloody two hours, regardless of how much I'd had to drink at the motel bar.My motel stay was now going to become an odyssey into that special pit of Hades where the line between movies and t.v. blurs, and the movies suffer the worst of it, deteriorating in quality before your very eyes; swelling, bloating, and exploding with that strange, dreadful force which used to torment me in high school when I was forced to attend pep assemblies. And I actually watched the whole thing.As if the casting of such t.v. spongecakes like Ted Danson and Tom Selleck wasn't enough, they had to include Steve Guttenberg for that extra-squishy, beefcake box-office draw. I actually longed for "Cocoon" sans the Don Ameche break-dancing sequence. But there's good news and bad news: The good news is, you don't have to watch Selleck running around in those ultra-tight corduroy shorts and severely tucked-in Hawaiian shirts he flaunted on "Magnum P.I.", the bad news is, you have to watch Ted Danson dance naked with a baby in a shower. It kind of makes you feel like you're pooping broken glass.And that leaves me with the perfect, cross-gender plot: Let's tell a story that embraces parenting and all of it's lovable details i.e. dirty diapers, food spit-ups, noise, and lack of sleep (I'm sure mothers, especially, will delight in all of these atrocities and revel in the clever detailing of each and every one of them) BUT we have it revolve around a bunch of thirty, forty-something hunk-types who are about as sexy as a rerun of"Matt Houston", and as satisfying as a Thanksgiving dinner at Popeyes Chicken. Since there aren't any guys who can stand these actors, what women find them so engaging, airline stewardesses?.And now the final reward for watching "Three Men and a Baby", regardless of how much beer and whiskey there is left to consume: baby humor. Oh, and don't we just love baby humor? Babies are such expressive little actors, creating the most ideal improvisational acting situations for such crafted thespians as Guttenberg and Danson who do their best to "goo-goo" and "ga-ga" with the likes of Olivier and Brando and Clift.I became so swollen with the overall effects of baby humor in the film that I began to talk baby-talk right there in the motel room while rocking back and forth until I broke water. Then I cried because the sequel to "Three Men..."Three Men and a Little Lady" wasn't on, and here it was only 3:30 in the morning. Maybe I'll get lucky on my NEXT motel stay.</fullReview>

This may be "Three" men, but it's really Tom Selleck's movie. And he might have been able to carry it had there not been a ridiculous gangster subplot. It could have been an interesting comedy about three men who have no idea what to do with a baby. Instead it was a string of bad jokes and bad acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Three Men and a Baby" is a fine comedy about three bachelors who are forced to take care of an abandoned baby that was left on their doorstep. The first 10 or 15 minutes are awful and if you are not careful you may be wanting to turn away from the film. However, the next hour or so is really funny and entertaining. Just when you think you have a winner on your hands, the movie reverts back to the way it started. The plot resolution is thin as paper and unbelievable. Overall an above average comedy that still comes up a bit short in the end. 3.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>
