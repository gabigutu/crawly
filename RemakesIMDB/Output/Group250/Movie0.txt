		<shortDescription>There's Something About Music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie started as a usual affair movie. Yet it went along straight in the middle and peaking up after it.One thing to be noted is the affection made by the music. It dominate the movie and swing our mood back and forth. And the tune Katherine Hepburn 'played' on piano really works well, with an additional song 'I Will' from the Beatles which turns out to be the movie secondary theme.The original movie has been remade before this, and many other movie uses the original 'Love Affair' as an additional magnet to it. It isn't too hard to guess where the storyline went.But the ending still caught us in deep emotion. We strongly feel love in it.Recommended for Saturday evening movie with your spouse alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Love...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beautiful film with great actors. Very moving, emotional and touching! Shows that everyone can change. Apparently, Beatty's life changed meeting Annette - in the film too. Katherine Hepburn is fantastic, a great actress and a great woman. Love Affair is not just about a love affair, it is a love story, a great love that changes your life, an unconditional unselfish love that puts the other first. It truly is a wonderful love story that has the moves, the light, the emotion, the music... "I love watching you move" - just one of the great lines that don't go away and become part of our own lines! I have watched it over and over and every single time I feel the same emotions. The scenery is also wonderful from the beautiful island shoots to central park in autumn. 10/10 easily...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't seen the Beatty/Bening remake of An Affair to Remember - don't! This review is for readers who have seen the original and know the basic premise. I was drawn to the movie because of Bening - I enjoy her other films, but this one is a mockery of her talent! The on-screen chemistry between her and Warren just isn't there. The taboo of engaged couples "cheating" on one another is stale and the premise that Bening selflessly gets on with her life after her accident is implausible in today's world. The chance that Beatty would have a little auntie (even if that auntie is Katherine Hepburn) living on a tropical island that just happens to be close to where the plane he was flying in makes an emergency landing, is too much of a coincidence even for a fairy tale. This movie is beyond real! The jazz vocal narrative is annoying and out of place. As for the tear jerker ending, Warren can't even come close to replicating the look on Cary Grant's face when he realizes the devastating truth about Deborah Kerr. Oh what I'd give for a really good love story!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Weak Remake to Satisfy Warren Beatty's Ego</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1932 "Love Affair" is one of the most beautiful, charming and brokenhearted love stories of the cinema industry. Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer have the perfect chemistry and it is impossible not fall in love for her.The 1957 "An Affair to Remember" is a remake frame by frame of the original movie and also more famous. Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr also have perfect chemistry and had been my favorite romance after "Casablanca" until the day I saw the 1932 "Love Affair".I was curious to see the 1994 version of "Love Affair" and I found it a weak remake maybe to satisfy the ego of Warren Beatty. The introduction is awful with annoying music score and edition. Mike Gambril is a detestable character and I do not see any reason for Terry falling in love with him. It is only good to see Ms. Katharine Hepburn in her last feature. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): "Segredos do Coraç?o" ("Secrets of the Heart")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why did Beatty and Bening decide to do a remake of one of the most romantic films of all time? They should have left it alone. There is little chemistry between them (despite the fact they are married in real life). No dramatic tension, no nothing. Katherine Hepburn, in a brief appearance, is the only bright spark in the whole thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Split decision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was very difficult to decide how to rate this movie. I'd not seen the Cary Grant / Deborah Kerr version (except for the little snippets that appear in "Sleepless in Seattle"), so my opinion was not colored by the inevitable comparisons... It's just that the first half of the movie struck me as being incredibly *bad* : it was poorly written in particular. Once Katherine Hepburn appeared on the scene, the film began to improve quite noticeably, and the last half was considerably better, with superb performances, especially from the two principals. I've never been a big Warren Beatty fan, but Annette Bening is WONDERFUL! (I think I've fallen in love!!!) -- To sum up, the first half of the movie rates a 3 in my book, the second half an 8 -- hence my overall grade of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third Time's "Almost" The Charm.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People that know the 2 movies "An Affair To Remember" and the re-make before this one also called "Love Affair",pretty much know what the movie is about and what to expect. After viewing it all, I can honestly say that this re-make was not really necessary. I'm not saying it suffers the same fate of Striesand's remake of "A Star Is Born" (also a third go-round) but for all intentional purposes,it's just okay and a bit bland. I know Beatty is a good actor and so is Annette but there's not a whole lot of dramatic feeling in their parts for my taste. Even after her character is hurt and can't walk,you just don't feel that sense of urgency about these two. Which makes it very hard to care what happens to them. I was far more moved by Aunt Ginny's passing than anything else. Speaking of her :Like many have stated here though,Katharine Hepburn's brief appearance more than makes up for it. Her part really should have been written so she could at least have been in the film for an hour.I also wish she hadn't been made to use a certain 4 letter word also,totally unnecessary and cheap low brow humor. In all,it's okay to watch if you've nothing better in your collection or to rent, It is worth it for Hepburn,as is almost anything Hepburn ever made. Six stars,for simply a watchable enough film and of course,because it was Kate's last theatrical movie-screen appearance. She was always the bright spot in any film,good or bad. (END)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still A Star Crossed Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anyone thinks that we've seen the last remake of Love Affair, think again. The Indian cinema has done a version of it a few years after this film came out. This story has a timeless appeal that Warren Beatty certainly recognized.Anyone who has seen the original Love Affair and the remake An Affair To Remember will know the plot of this film exactly. Warren Beatty and Annette Bening fill the shoes of previous lovers Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne and Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. With very few deviations except those to update the story this film has the same plot.One of those deviations has our star crossed lovers Warren Beatty and Annette Bening meeting on a transoceanic flight to Sydney, Australia which is certainly a lot of time to get acquainted. They get even better acquainted when they are forced to land on a Pacific island where Beatty's grandmother Katharine Hepburn has a nice tropical place. The kind of setting where romance has to bloom.This was Katharine Hepburn's last big screen appearance, she did one more television film and then her Parkinson's Disease and other ailments that beset people of the age she lived to forced her retirement. I'll bet she never thought she would in 1939 wind up in a remake of a film doing a part Maria Ouspenskaya created. She does it grand style though and only Kate can make an old Anglo-Saxon expletive sound elegant.That Warren Beatty got nominated for a Razzie award for remaking Love Affair is a disgrace. This is old fashioned romantic entertainment, the kind that old Hollywood used to do. I think Beatty and everyone connected with this Love Affair should be proud.I notice that Leo McCarey who wrote and directed Love Affair and An Affair To Remember is prominently listed on the screen credits. He'd be proud of this remake himself, I'm sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've often heard how so many people, mostly women love the movie "An Affair To Remember," and yet, I never cared much for it. I like the actors, Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr, but the storyline and the idea of "an affair" didn't really appeal to me. I also didn't realize that it was a remake of "Love Affair" from 1939 starring Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer. I happened to see piece of it on a cruise ship and my husband and I recognized some of the dialog. And we both remember the reference to the movie in "Sleepless In Seattle." It was interesting to see this and I decided to borrow it from the library to watch and after watching it, I still didn't find "An Affair To Remember" very appealing. At the same time, I noticed the movie "Love Affair" with Warren Beatty and Annette Benning. I'm not really fans of either, but, for some reason, this movie caught my attention. It's possible it has appeal because here is an actor who was once known as a lifetime bachelor who has now married to an actress and raised four children and the chemistry with the woman he chose to spend his life with shows through. The music throughout the movie is beautiful and the main storyline follows its predecessor, but the dialog is fresh. I was glad to see that the "sensationalism" promoted by paparazzi is quelled by the quick wit of Mike Gambril paying a crew member to present a telegram to the photographer to send him on a wild chase preventing the "scandal" as in "An Affair To Remember." This movie gave me reason to like the story. I find that, even if I am not a fan of particular actors, I can enjoy a movie if they put their heart and souls into the project and not worry about impressing the viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A scene which is worth a whole film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever I want to watch a film in which Warren Beatty's name appears,I know that there must be a damn good reason that has made him contribute to this film.He doesn't have that many films,and there is hardly a film of his that doesn't have a strong statement to make.When I sat down to watch "Love Affair",I didn't know that it was a re-make of the 1939's "Love Affair" and 1957's "An Affair to Remember".I was so marveled with the boyish charm of Warren Beatty when he was trying to hook up the main female character of the film,his real life wife,Annette Bening as Terry McKay,and it was after Mike(Warren's character)and Terry's visit to his aunt,superbly portrayed by Katharine Hepburn,that I noticed the similarities.By the sheer appearance of Hepburn as Mike's aunt on the scene,even before she had noticed the arrival of her nephew,when she was chatting with the docks,she established her presence so rapidly and strongly that made me forget about the other characters.However strong was Hepburn's performance,how much it overshadowed the performance of Beatty and Bening,it was justified.One could sense their admiration towards her, not only as the characters of the film,but as co-workers as well.And that's exactly what gives truthfulness to the point of documentary,to this scene.When Beatty was listening and watching the two women perform the song ,it was obvious that it was not just Mike looking at his aunt,but also Warren Beatty,stoned in awe of the sensitivity and artistry of a Legend.The same goes for Annette Benning.In her conversations with the aunt, and while she was accompanying her by humming,while she was playing the piano,it was again Annette Bening dazzled by her aura.At that point, both us,the viewers,and Beatty and Bening became one,we all were viewers.They were all swans,both the couple dressed in white and in total peace and harmony with themselves and the nature,and the old and wise aunt,Katharine Hepburn,making her unforgettable performance as her swan song.If there is a reason for this film to exist, is that scene.The scenes following their arrival in New York do not have the saying and drive of the first half of the film.Even the scene with Ray Charles which is the living proof of the victory of love and dedication over any misfortune,is not able to prevent the spectator from feeling sorry for the lovers,instead of celebrating their re-union.The scene with the aunt was so honest, so profound,that I was expecting something new,something breathtaking as that scene itself.And I kept telling to myself that this is a Warren Beatty film,it is eventually going to take another turn, unravel another aspect of the story,it isn't going to end like that.But to my surprise it did.The "Love Affair" which began in the sky ended on a not strong enough land.But it made us the witnesses of one of cinema's most cherishable moments,the getting together of the guru and her apostles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are multiple reasons to like this. I'll mention two.One comes from the fact that it is a remake. Such things have miraculous properties. Storytelling is all about choices, most invisible. Its the goal sometimes. But when you have a remake and you know the original, then all the scaffolding of the thing becomes visible and you can marvel or not at the changes that have been made. The choices.I do not know the 1939 version, but I do the 57 version with Cary Grant. Its not just mawkish and cheap, its offensive, even vile. The method of presentation depends not on the love, but on the helplessness of the pair. They are quite literally prostitutes, professional paid escorts. He is enchanted by her primarily because she didn't show at the rendezvous and since no one had ever turned him down before he fell in "love" hard, because of the chase. It hit all the negative buttons, even the racist ones.This redone in such a way that it avoids all those faults. It has almost precisely the same story, but instead of cheap sentimental exploitation, you get rich cinematic romance. You get love embodied in actors, three good ones. You get real love ? at least so far as movies have ? and not infatuation. You have lovers adjusting lives to fit, not tossing advantage in spite.For me it worked as a romantic movie. I know it failed to sell many tickets, and can only guess that it was too honest and true, with not enough sweeping violins. We don't like true love in movies.And that brings me to the other value, the fold with real life. Beatty really was the sort of character he played here, a serial screwer, a man engaged in the chase, someone not to be trusted but who clearly has an image-based artistic side. Benning's reputation was less public, but she was close to being the most desirable woman in Hollywood after "Grifters." They really did fall in love. At filming, she was already carrying their second child. The chemistry is real and conveyed effectively. I make a special study of films where the director is in love with the main actress. Its rare that such a man has such a love, and produces, writes and stars in such a profession of love. Life folded into film romance done competently and cinematically. Is there anything in film romance that matters more?The palette is rosey. Its lovely to watch.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without her this movie would be maybe something to watch on a rainy Saturday afternoon when there's not much on cable. But K Hepburn takes this film from "ok" to "something worth spending spending time watching." Even at her age the strength of her character and acting ability brought the few sparks there were into this film. But I've always considered Warren &amp; Annette a perfect match...bland...bland...and more bland. Do they have a personality?? I truly don't understand how they got to where they are today, but I could say the very same thing about some of our re-electeds. If you want to watch a much better version of the story with an entirely different sphere of acting check out the 1957 version "An Affair to Remember" with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. Some scenes are a little outdated, but the acting and chemistry between these two make it timeless. They've made their characters seem so real, they almost jump out of the screen. Then it all comes to a head in this heartbreakingly emotional ending, a story of selfless love, I cry every time. Annette &amp; Warren simply don't have the acting ability or charisma to give these characters that certain kind of trueness in which you would feel any great emotional investment. They strike me as very into themselves sort of selfish people anyway, could they truly characterize selflessness?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sincere remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Gambril (Warren Beatty) is a playboy former NFL quarterback. His agent Kip DeMay (Garry Shandling) is overjoyed that he's engaged to talk show host Lynn Weaver worth $100 million. He's on a flight sitting next to singer Terry McKay (Annette Bening) to Sydney. The plane is forced to land on Cook Island in a storm. They take a cruise ship to Tahiti where they visit his elderly aunt Ginny (Katharine Hepburn). They agree to meet on top of Empire State Building upon returning. She breaks up with her fiancé Ken Allen (Pierce Brosnan) and he breaks up with Lynn but the meeting does not go off as planned.This is a remake of the 1939 classic. There is something odd about a remake of a classic that is ringing so many of the same bells. It feels like a checklist. As for the romance, that too feels familiar. Bugsy was three years prior. None of this movie feels fresh. It's a faded copy of an icon.</fullReview>

There version is so much better. You can see the chemistry in their relationship. It is very enjoyable to watch and still cry at the end. Speaking of the end, their version is believable and see they really have emotion for each other. Course they are together in real life too, but they did a perfect job of acting.

		<fullReview>If you know the story, and have seen the earlier versions, this is still worth a viewing. The current drama/romance genre is something I am not often fond of, yet this film had a resonance, especially for the holiday season.No, it is not the same as the Deborah Kerr, Cary Grant version, but that is a bit dated. There is a cameo scene with Katharine Hepburn, she as Beatty's great- aunt, he as someone at a crossroads in his life; wondering if there will be a turning point. Bening is a singer/actress, they agree to meet in NY, a year after if neither is attached to their current significant other. Beatty and Bening actually make a nice couple, for me to have enjoyed this film at Christmas, points to the fact that it is not another romantic comedy we can toss out ( a rare thing) probably because Beatty and Bening have a believable chemistry together.The final scene, sad as it is Christmas, and the children singing a version of the Beatles' "I will" is atmospheric. It was (for me anyway ) a more moving scene than the older version, perhaps because the children singing in the 1950's version- were singing a song from that 1950's time period....Highly recommended. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This version of a movie previously filmed twice was quite charming for this first time Love Affair viewer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had my mom not rented this from Netflix, I probably wouldn't have bothered to see this third version of a romance previously filmed twice before by Leo McCarey. Real-life married couple Warren Beatty and Annette Bening play two people engaged to others (Kate Capshaw, Pierce Brosnan) who chance meet on a plane and then fall for each other on a cruise ship. At a pit stop, they visit Beatty's aunt (Katherine Hepburn in her last feature role) who provides some views about love. After that, they make a pact to meet at the Empire State Building after a few months and...well, if you've seen the other two (which I haven't) you know what happens. I wasn't sure what to think of this movie with many of the quick-cutting of some scenes and many of the somewhat benign nature of some of the dialogue at the beginning but by the time of Hepburn's appearance, I was charmed by the way Beatty and, especially, Bening interacted with the veteran 4-time Oscar winner especially with the way Ms. Hepburn used a certain word in asking about ducks. Also with her appearance as well as a later one with Ray Charles singing "The Christmas Song", I wondered about what great losses we've had the last five or so years. Many of the supporting cast like Garry Shandling and Harold Ramis (neither of whom I thought had any funny scenes) I recognized but I didn't realize Wendie Jo Sperber and Lisa Edelstein were here until I read the end credits. I did like also some of the musical selections like the "M'm! M'm! Good!" spot with Ed McMahon, the children's chorus of The Beatles' "I Will", and that duet with Louis Jordan and Louis Armstrong on "Life Is So Peculiar" that scored some of the cruise scenes. And the concluding scene was quite touching (if not tear-inducing) that I'm willing to give this version of Love Affair a pass. Bottom line, this was worth seeing for any romantics still out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love at First Sight--in Designer Sunglasses. Real-life couple Warren Beatty and Annette Bening are the star-crossed lovers in this remake of 1939's "Love Affair", which in turn was remade as "An Affair to Remember" in 1957. It's a gauzy, soft-focus, soft-headed confection about a playboy who becomes smitten with an attractive woman while on his way to marry somebody else; she's also otherwise engaged, and their on-again/off-again relationship has the same old-fashioned complications as the other versions of this highly-concocted plot. The material is really only as good as the actors selling it, and Beatty and Bening are certainly a striking twosome. Unfortunately, they don't seem to have noticed that 37 years have passed since this tale had some merit, and the results are distinctly musty. Overall, there's not enough energy in the direction nor heart in the general handling to make this a memorable 'Affair'. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible Spoilers Ahead (though if you've seen either the original "Love Affair" or "An Affair to Remember", the only spoiler is this entire movie). Okay, this movie was terrible. People don't fall in love by having incredibly inciteful conversations on a plane upon their first meeting. Even Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr started with just some minor flirtations without completely psychoanalyzing each other. (I'll make all my comparisons to "An Affair to Remember" since I haven't seen the original "Love Affair".) This movie just tries too hard. Characters, just like real people, can develop a deep relationship without saying deep things right off the bat. Warren Beaty and Annette Bening's chemistry was zilch, especially when compaired to Kerr and Grant, who's chemistry was some of the best I've ever seen on film. Even Katharine Hepburn, whom I adore, wasn't up to her usual standard. She didn't come across as sweet and as inviting as the grandmother of "An Affair to Remember", and I know for a fact that she doesn't play the piano (see "Song of Love" for further proof), while her predicessor at least made an effort. Nothing in the movie is as good as the original-I could rip apart every little moment if you want, but I do have something resembling a life. I realize that "Remember" was a remake itself, but I don't think I would have liked this movie even if I hadn't fallen in love with "Remember". These two characters don't ever seem to fall for anything more than the pseudo-deep conversation on the plane and physical attraction, whereas Kerr and Grant talk about their lives and interests. How many times throughout their film does one say "What were you saying?" when the other said nothing, and the first one then proceeds to say exactly what they were thinking? Quite a few, for those not fortunate enough to have seen it yet. That's a connection, not Beatty gazing drunkenly at Benning across the table. As for the music everyone raves about, "Remember" had a beautiful theme song, complete with vocals, that was weaved throughout the film. This theme song sounded so close that I kept trying to sing "Remember's" lyrics to it and always fell short. That was distracting, not beautiful. Watch "An Affair to Remember" instead, PLEASE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can't help but compare this to An Affair to Remember, whether you've seen the original Love Affair, or not. The cinematography of this film is very dated, unfortunately during a period when there seemed to have been a 'darker the better' policy, even outdoors during daylight. In stark contrast to An Affair to Remember which was always bright enough to see the scene. Grant and Kerr are a more believable couple than Beatty and Bening, ironically. Bening's affection for her character's friend (Meg Ryan) in the Women was more obvious than her love for Beatty's character in this movie. Maybe Beatty's inadequacies were just more obvious next to the brilliance of Katherine Hepburn, but his character's love of his aged relative was not obvious at all. Thinking back on the movie 24 hours after seeing it for the first time, I can't think of any reason why I'd recommend it.</fullReview>

The story revolves around two people (Warren and Annette) who crossed their paths while on a flight. they had emergency landing on an island where she meets his aunt (Katharine Hepburn). on a flight back, they have agreed to meet again after 3 months if they still like/love each other.This movie has the total charm. Warren and Annette played their roles with charms, I find them cute and fantastic. I love the scene with Katharine Hepburn, and I think the end scene of this version is more powerful compared in the other versions. The way Annette and Warren delivered their lines are more beautiful and realistic and somehow I think I'm seeing them real. Warren is cute, Annette is perfect, Katharine is indescribable. The background music has a great effect too, it leaves a beautiful feeling to the listener/viewer. You can't just forget it.Well, I don't to want to compare it more with the over versions. I go for this one solid, no matter what because I love watching them move! :)I gave it 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>resent is most important. I agree with him 100%, but as everyone knows well, to know is different from to do. However I really want to enjoy my real life and share happiness with others. When I watched this movie, I was so happy and able to enjoy the present while I was watching it.Some people don't like romantic movies, they said the situations are ridiculous and acting is so exaggerated, but this movie is my cup of tea. I like a warm-hearted and make believe story about the power of love because in the real world there are a lot of sad things and scary news. I don't want to listen to these things any more. Even though movies are not real, I hope to feel the beauty of the nature and persons.This movie is about love story. Ex-football star Mike Gambril (Warren Beatty) meets Terry McKay (Annette Bening) on a flight, and then they are forced to land because of a weather condition. Both are engaged to others, but they fall in love each other. They promise that they will meet again in New York few months later. I don't want to spoil this movie, so you should watch this if you want to know the ending.This movie's setting is a beautiful island and New York. When they went to Mike's Aunt's house, the setting is very beautiful and refined. Even though it's just picture, I could feel that I am there. I can feel the wind and heavy rain in this movie. I can see the camera director's effort to take a photograph of the beauty of the nature.Especially I like the music and scenery most. This film's music is so beautiful and wonderful, for example "Love Affair Piano Solo" by Ennio Morricone, "I Will" by Beatles, "Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire" by Ray Charles. Even if you missed a chance to see this movie I strongly recommend to listen to this film's music . Most of all in the last scene while Mike is saying "If anything had to happen to one of us, why did it have to be you?", 'Love Affair Piano Solo' makes this scene the most beautiful and graceful. During watching this movie, actually I'm interested in the movie music and their dialogues. The lines from this movies are very simple, and poetic. The most famous line is "I like watching you move".In addition Terry's styling is the best!! I can't take away my eyes from her styling from the beginning to the end of this movie. Her white long dress and her beautiful scarf make this movie one of the great art pictures.One of the impressive things is that Warren Beatty and Annette Bening fell in love during a making this movie. Their feeling in this movie is not acting, but it's close to reality. I think this is the big reason why this movie could be so romantic.If you enjoy watching a romantic story, please watch this movie with a glass of wine on Friday night! It is the best choice for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great ending redeems sluggish first half.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version of Love Affair (made for the third time) is a film that suffers from a sluggish first half while trying to achieve its goal of having its main characters fall in love. To aide this goal, the characters played by Warren Beatty and Annette Bening take an excursion to a remote Pacific Ocean island to visit the Katharine Hepburn character, a plot point too transparent and contrived to truly be effective. Still, the film manages to redeem itself in the third act with subtle yet powerful drama. The acting is fine, particularly Annette Bening but both she and Warren Beatty shine in the final, heart-wrenching scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Romantic; Beatty &amp; Benning are Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie two or three times, and really enjoy it.Warren Beatty plays the part of a football coach with a reputation as a ladies' man. In this role, he is so smooth, sensing what is and isn't said in his moments with love interest (played by Annette Benning), and somehow remaining sincere &amp; vulnerable -- you can SEE how this would entice any woman with a pulse. Fellows can watch and learn from seeing a pro at work.Annette Benning is poised, beautiful as always. The few scenes with Kathleen Hepburn are especially powerful. Her one-on-one talk with Benning gives us 2 women figuring each other out, artfully and respectfully. It makes you appreciate the fine art of good conversation.I highly recommend this film. It is a (sappy) romantic film ("chick flick") -- but it will put a tear in your guy's eye, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's not to like.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's not to like. I love this movie and I am amazed at how many people still have not seen it. I have teenager girls and I instead that they both "An Affair to Remember" as well as "Love Affair" both are classics in my book. It has always been a good story and sometimes the producers and directors fail miserably when attempting a remake. But not in this case. Excellent job. You know, there are just those times when the casting is perfect. I will be coordinating a talent show with toddlers and teens this Fall and would love to locate the song which the children sign language to. I know it is by the Beattles (John Lennon) and is titled "I Will". I just can't seem to find a MP3 file on it. Please help. At this point, I would even settle for the sheet music. Thanks in advance for all your help and comments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>semantic confusions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indeed people should generally not wait for the same thing if it comes, say, from Hollywood or Europe. In the case of "Love Affair" people should watch opera rather than this genre -- I highly recommend "Carmen" with Julia Miguenes-Johnson and Placido Domingo (1984) -- the epitome of a love affair as immortal as always! Titles chosen by the movie industry have -- alas! -- transcended good taste, and with it, semantic borders: maybe simply by following the pattern of our modern lives where the element of surprise has been discarded and replaced by circadian and pecuniary worries. Comparing Cary Grant to Warren Beatty (in terms of this being a remake) is like putting Berlioz next to Madonna!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a solid movie in its own right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i re-watched this movie recently, after not having viewed it in quite a few years. i enjoyed the movie immensely, as i did eight years ago, when i first saw it.there are many reasons why i enjoyed the beatty-bening adaptation.first, i didn't consciously attempt to make connections between this movie and the grant/kerr version. granted, it may be fair to do so, but it ruins your enjoyment of the film. beatty is obviously not going to rate well in comparison to cary grant, but then again, how many actors would?second, i was not discomfited by the apparent uneven nature of the film. yes, it started out as a fairly light comedy, punched up by a spirited jazz vocal soundtrack, and finished as a classic, romantic tearjerker with a sweeping score by ennio morricone--but this was completely purposeful. the movie is blatantly mimicking the passages of love, suggesting that the playfulness and flirtation of courtship inexorably leads to the seriousness and heartstopping emotion of true love.third, contrary to what other opinions suggest, i felt sincere chemistry between the two leads. the stages of falling in love seemed genuine and paced appropriately, and stirred up memories of the feelings i remember--the clever banter of dating, then the walking on tenter-hooks feeling of people first coming to the realization that they are in love, and later, the aching pain of seemingly unrequited love.the movie is not perfect (beatty's face has the expressiveness of a toasted bagel). more than anything, the film's plot, direction, and score are very emotionally manipulative--but then again, isn't that what the film is supposed to do after all?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie has many of the shortcomings of the 1957 remake...the script is weak and the acting is lacking...but unlike 'an affair to remember', there is much to redeem this movie...first, the music gives it a definite shot in the arm...second, there is the scenery which appears to be shot on location and is strikingly beautiful in some cases..third, there is Katherine Hepburn who is masterful in a very brief appearance...fourth, the comedy works...Shandling and Ramis are great additions, and Beatty plays the his role with humorous undertones throughout the movie...finally, Benning is cute, beautiful, and elegant...for me, there is no comparison between this and other versions..this is head and shoulders about the rest...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Katharine Hepburn's sophisticated attention to nuance is just one example of the beauty in this understated passionate yet bittersweet love story.If you liked "Indochine" or "Shadowlands", this movie is for you. The old story of lukewarm engagement broken to make room for passion of a grand scale is an old one, but treated with more integrity than films such as "The English Patient" or "Titanic", which pale in comparison. Add Warren Beatty, Garry Shandling, a brief appearance by Ray Charles, and you can't lose. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was totally taken aback by this movie. I had no idea it was a remake of An Affair To Remember. Somewhere through what I thought was a trite flick (which I suggested we stop watching on several occasions) I saw the 'parallel'.Then the end came - the famous scene where the hero sees the heroine's painting... It knocked me out.This is a remake that speaks to us. Us of today. I've since watched this movie several times a day for a week or more. Can I recommend it? Yes - if you don't know what's going to happen. It's astounding in its effect. Take this review or leave it!</fullReview>

While I write my comment I hear the soundtrack of Ennio Morricone.Ennio Morricone!The bare name tells us everything.He was the very man to create the music for Love Affair. The whole movie is surrounded by a mystical brightness. One of the best scenes is when Katherine Hepburn plays the piano and Annette Bening sings. I love it.This movie has everything you need in a romance. And when you have seen it first you have it still in your mind and you think about it. Fantastic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched Love Story numerous times, and every time it touches my heart. This is my favorite movie of all time! Annette Benning and Warren Beatty are outstanding. Katherine Hepburn adds a touch of whimsy to the story. It is just a delightful movie and warms my heart. I always wonder if this movie was made during the beginning of their (Annette and Warren's)love story. I was amazed to see that this movie was listed as not successful on the movie charts. I couldn't believe that since it is such a warm, delightful, moving story. It has been on television both yesterday and today and I found myself watching it both days. I couldn't stay away from this wonderful movie and the charming work of both these really fine actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warren Beatty is not as dreamily handsome as Cary Grant but Beatty is such a skilled actor that his portrayal of Mike Gambril got through the poignancy of the dilemma of a man at the crossroads. Anette Bening was quite good too, especially in avoiding extreme sentimentality. For those who hate tear-jerker movies, this remake of "An Affair to Remember" would be the one to see.The song in the two versions are different, and the viewer would have a better appreciation for the similarities and differences if the composer, lyrics, and a sound clip of each song were included in the info.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite impressive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big devotee of the original 'Love Affair' I recorded this one mainly out of morbid curiosity, with the intention of pulling it to pieces once I was done. I have *never* seen a good remake of a classic film (Sweet November anyone? *throws up*) but I must say, grudgingly, this one was good. Not great, not a patch on the original, but good nontheless, and worth seeing at least once. Possibly the best thing is that in remaking it, they simply re-cast the film, changed only a few minor details, managed to keep all of the good scenes intact, and did not need to throw in a lot of sex. For a change. And so, that rates it a few more points from me, because there's honestly nothing worse than remaking a classic and throwing in lots of sex, when the original did perfectly fine without it. This 'Love Affair' was in that respect definitely more mature than many recent films. It's a simple delight for everyone of all ages and in another fifty years I wouldn't mind calling this one a classic. Well, that might be pushing it a little.Katharine Hepburn was brilliant as always and although I've never seen Beatty or Bening before in any films, I can't find anything wrong in their casting (thank god it wasn't Adam Sandler or Keanu!). Beatty is of course no Boyer or Cary Grant but he handled the closing scene superbly, and I must say if anything of Bening's ever pops up on tv again, I might give it a look. She has to be a pretty good actress for me to stop glaring at her because she's not Irene Dunne! And I liked the scene where she was singing the Beatles' song as well, there should have been a full performance of that.I'd give this a 7/10, because I can't help but compare it to the original. I would say to watch it because I liked it, but only if you watch the original first! And that's an order.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a dud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite all the great talent corralled together for this film, it is a resounding dud. Warren Beatty tries to be another Cary Grant but he just doesn't have the latter's charm, elegance, and class. Annette Benning is affecting, but together the two don't put much passion or urgency in their supposedly torrid affair. About the only reason to watch this movie is to catch a brief glimpse of 86 year-old Katharine Hepburn, and this is hardly her best work. Aficionados of this genre would be better of tracking down the film on which it was based, "An Affair to Remember" (1957), with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr, itself a Technicolor remake of the black-and-white "Love Affair" (1939).</fullReview>
