		<shortDescription>This is how an action movie should be like!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Biggest problem with most action movies is that they take themselves way too serious. "True Lies" is mainly fun and entertaining and on top of that, the action is top class!Finally a movie of which I can say: "Budget well spend!" The action really jumps off the screen but it never feels overdone or forced, which is thanks to action-director veteran James Cameron. He should stick to directing action movies like this, the Terminator movies and "Aliens". Please no more movies like "Titanic"! (not that it was a VERY bad movie) Stick to were your talent lies.The movie can be described as an American James Bond, meaning that everything is bigger and I'm not just talking about Arnie's chest. Just like the James Bond movies, it doesn't take itself seriously without making itself ridiculous.Many people seem to have problems with the whole "wife side track, story-line" I guess I'm one of the few that doesn't mind it at all and actually find it an extra addition to the story.The movie has everything a good action movie need: A believable action hero, explosions, chases, gun fights, a stereotype villain and a high entertainment value.I wish more action movies like this would be made.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Arnie. Big, loud, and hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, Arnie and Cameron team up to deliver a terrific action film.Arnie stars as a secret agent posing as a computer salesman. Not even his wife knows his true identity and since he is always busy she decides to have a little excitement and hooks up with a nitwit posing as a secret agent! In the mean while, in trying to get her back, Arnie gets his family inadvertently pushed into a plot, by terrorists to nuke the USA! Preposterous? Yes! Hilarious? YES!!!The resulting film has Arnie chasing motorcycles on horseback through hotels all the way to "borrowing" Harrier jets from the military. And, of course, getting his wife and daughter back.Packed with awesome action scenes and some really terrific hilarious moments this is what an action movie should be. Not too serious and not too pointless. 8/10Rated R: violence and profanity</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Cameron has directed some fantastic action movies during his career (Aliens, the first two Terminator movies, The Abyss, Titanic--that boat action was like totally awesome!!), but none were as funny as True Lies is. Arnold Schwarzenegger (Terminator, Eraser, the Governor of California) is Harry Tasker, a computer programming father by day, James Bond by night, working for a top secret government agency that is beyond the CIA and run by Charlton Heston. Tom Arnold, in his first dramatic role, plays Harry's partner, Gib, and is the smartass, class clown of the agency. Schwarzenegger and Arnold have a fantastic chemistry, creating the movie's biggest laughs. Jamie Lee Curtis plays Harry's under-appreciated wife, Helen, who flirts with the idea of leaving Harry for a used-car salesman, played with uber-confidence by Bill Paxson. Helen finds out the true identity of her husband in another funny scene where both are captured by Arab terrorists with help from a truth serum. The action part of True Lies comes from Harry trying to track down the nuclear bomb that has been stolen by the terrorists. A wonderfully shot escape scene on the bridge that connects the Florida Keys to the mainland is the pinnacle of True Lies. An action film that does not take itself too seriously (notice all of the silly Arnold-lines peppered throughout the movie, my personal favorite being "you're fired!" before Trump thought of it), True Lies is wildly entertaining, so much so that you almost forget Tom Arnold was married to Roseanne.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The secret agent Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has been happily married with his wife, the legal secretary Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis), for many years living in the suburbs and having a teenager daughter, Dana (Eliza Dushku). Helen does not suspect that Harry has a double life, and she believes he is a computer salesman. After a top-secret mission, Harry finds evidences that Helen is having an affair with Simon (Bill Paxton), an used cars salesman that seduced Helen with the glamour and excitement of his fake life, telling her that he is a spy. Harry forces his partner Albert Gibson (Tom Arnold) to use the resources of their agency to follow Simon and Helen; they abduct Helen wearing masks and later they assign a pseudo mission for her. However, a group of terrorists kidnap Helen and Harry and the couple gets involved with a dangerous group that possesses an atomic bomb ready to be exploded in Florida."True Lies" is one of the best adventures ever, and I personally do not recall how many times I have watched this excellent movie. The story is amazingly good, with a magnificent screenplay that alternates action with comedy. Arnold Schwarzenegger, his partner Tom Arnold and Bill Paxton are hilarious, with very funny liens and situations. Jamie Lee Curtis is not only funny, but also extremely sexy and hot, and I love when she says that she married Rambo. The special effects in the action scenes are stunning. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "True Lies"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnold, James and Bill. How can you go wrong?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a film has extravagant special effects, robust action, dazzling direction, wicked comedy and a cast of great actors like Schwarzenegger and Curtis and Arnold and Paxton, how can you go wrong? You can't.True Lies is one of the best action films to come out, ever. I don't think James Cameron knows how to make a bad film and that may be because he knows a winning team. He has teamed up with these same players before and the results have been the biggest grossing film ever, a soon to be trilogy that started his and the big guy's career and a scary film about extra-terrestrials. Well True Lies is just one more amazing film in Cameron's gold mine repertoire. This really is a terrific film and it is one of the best pure action films I've ever seen. And it is wickedly funny, " Did you kill anyone? "" Yea, but they were all bad. " Priceless.Here we have three separate issues happening simultaneously. Arnold and Arnold play two agents that are reminiscent to Bond type characters. They infiltrate castles and steel secrets and blow things up. They are very good at what they do and as perfect as they are at their job, Schwartzenegger's home life suffers from it. His wife ( played with amazing sexuality buy Jamie Lee Curtis ) loves him unconditionally, but she is a little bored because he is gone half the time and when he is home he tells her about boring computer meetings and how he wowed his clientelle with the latest micro-chips, when in reality he is running through a snow covered field with a tuxedo on while being chased by men on skis carrying Uzis. But she of course isn't allowed to know about that, something in the name of national security. Hence we have Simon. Simon is played for laughs brilliantly by Bill Paxton. He is the kind of guy that has a normal life but preys on women that may be missing excitement from their life. This is where he meets Mrs. Tasker. And he puts the moves on her, seeing the sexiness underneath all of her facades and insecurities. Paxton and Schwartz. play well off one another and here is no exception as they meet when Arnold goes to his car lot and pretends he wants to buy a car. Paxton innadvertently tells the man who's wife he is trying to with, that there is this hot little fox that he is almost in with. Simon laughs like a slob and Harry has a vision of breaking his nose. It is played for laughs but it is here that Schwartz. gets to show some of this best acting abilities.The third story is the actual bad guys that want to detonate nuclear warheads in New York for some sort of revenge. Somehow the three stories mesh perfectly together as Curtis gets mixed up by accident with the terrorists thinking that Simon is being chased by them and so on. There is so much energy in this film, so much comedy, so much of everything for everyone that I really can't see how anyone could not like this film.True Lies is one of the best action films ever and this is probably Arnie's best acting. Cameron and Arnie work well together, and Cameron works well with Paxton and hell Arnie and Paxton work well together ( Commando, Terminator and this one). It would almost be impossible for this film not be great. And that it certainly is. You should have no problem popping this one in the DVD or VCR and getting lost in excitement for two hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why should one watch this film? It's stupid, without any character developments and is about as believable as any James Bond movie. I'll tell you: It's great fun. When I watch a movie, I try not to confuse art with entertainment, as some commenters clearly have done. True Lies doesn't have a hint of art - but its comic-style spirit and adventurous action is compelling. And please don't be childish - admit you like seeing nukes go off on screen. This film isn't a Great Film. But it is Great Fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Cameron directs this terrific action flick that gives way to bursts of comedy. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a spy trying to keep his profession a secret from his wife(Jamie Lee Curtis)and realizes that she is having an affair. The mild mannered salesman is really a double fisted devil may care secret agent. The beginning and final sequences are a movie in themselves. My favorite scenes are Curtis' striptease in the hotel and her "cat fight" with the gorgeous Tia Carrere in the limo. Plenty of gun fights and big bangs to please everyone. The cast also features Bill Paxton, Art Malik and Tom Arnold in his funniest and greatest role as Schwarzenegger's sidekick. There is a small role for Charlton Heston as the stern single minded boss. Absolute entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extremely entertaining action movie that, for some reason, I like but don't love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** out of ****I've seen True Lies at least four times now, and every time I find myself having a great time watching this first-rate action/comedy/thriller. But it's a movie that I can't muster more than passable (but occasionally fairly ecstatic) enthusiasm for. It's a very good action movie, and I can certainly see how it's attained a reputation as one of the best adrenaline-pumping rides of the 90's, but it's not great.What True Lies has is one of the more ingenious action movie premises I've seen. Arnold Schwarzenegger is Harry Tasker, a husband (to Jamie Lee Curtis) and father (to Eliza Dushku) by day, and world-saving CIA agent by night (or day, it depeneds). His latest assignment puts him on the case of a mad Islamic terrorist called Aziz, who's retrieved several nuclear warheads and plans to set them off on U.S. soil if his group's demands are not met. Complicating matters for Harry is the inclusion of his wife, Helen, whom he believes is having an affair with a used car salesman (Bill Paxton, in what's got to be his funniest performance).In terms of pure escapist enjoyment, this is actually James Cameron's most successful film. True Lies is probably the only Cameron film that never suffers from the slightest hiccup in pacing (yes, Aliens had a slow beginning and viewing The Abyss was like watching molasses sliding down a brick wall). From beginning to end, there's not a single slow spot, as you can expect either a sharply staged action sequence or comical setpiece around every corner. To keep such momentum up for 141 minutes is pretty damn amazing, and Cameron must be given credit for making such a long movie almost so effortlessly enjoyable.But for all that is so enjoyable about it, True Lies lacks a strong plot (in terms of action, as the romantic subplot is actually quite excellent). The villains are stereotypical terrorists, pure cartoons who don't even make an impression as cool villains. In his heyday, Arnold has battled tons of memorable villains (T-1000 and the Predator stand out), the terrorists here are clearly among the weakest of Arnold's foes to date.The action is suitably over-the-top, especially the harrier jet climax, which makes almost all the action that came before it believable in comparison. But the action is mostly excellent, the shootouts and fistfights are exciting, there's plenty of cliffhanger thrills, and the chase/catfight set on the lengthy bridge is classic. The movie has to keep a balance between strong violence and screwball humor, which it pulls off very well. The half-hour segment devoted entirely to Harry's marital problems is hilarious, its only flaw being the abrupt segue to "typical" Arnold action. Even when Arnold's taking down massive armies of terrorists, Cameron still maintains the same light tone evident during the comical scenes, while still keeping the action thrilling. That's quite an accomplishment. The cast is all excellent, given the material and intent. Schwarzenegger is still the extremely likeable big lug. These roles aren't a stretch for him, but he excels at such parts because he radiates charisma like no other actor (even if they may all be better than him when it comes to talent). As the comic relief, Tom Arnold is surprisingly very funny (since then, it hasn't been so surprising as he's actually provided decent humor in those Andrzej Bartkowiak films, or however you spell the guy's name). Jamie Lee Curtis is wonderful, too, and I've never been a big fan of hers. Without a doubt, this is easily her most winning performance.One of the big box-office hits of 1994, I was surprised to see True Lies didn't inspire any genuine imitators. Just as well, I suppose, there's only so much Bond "parody" you can see without the material getting tiresome (Austin Powers, anyone?). But True Lies' charms lies in that it works as parody while still excelling as a straight action thriller. When it comes to pure direction, that's proof James Cameron can be a genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vivid reminder of just how exciting an action film can be...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzenegger (Harry Tasker) is a super spy character who works for (eye-patched Charlton Heston) Omega Force, and tracks down international terrorists...His marvelous wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) nor their teenage daughter Dana (Eliza Dushku) know anything about it... Helen thinks he's rather a dull computer salesman...Things go rough when Harrie begins to suspect that his wife, a very conservative secretary, maybe is having an affair with a man pretending to be a spy... So he immediately brings all the resources of his department to find out what is really going on... In addition, Harry was focusing on a Middle Eastern terrorist group called the Crimson Jihad who terrorizes the United States with nuclear weapons...In my mind, and I'll bet the rest of you will feel the same as well, Schwarzenegger has enough physical bravado for the job... Best example: his scene holding Helen from the moving helicopter... He does a credible 007?like character, especially out, in and around an ultra exclusive Swiss château... His hot tango, with Asian beauty Tia Carrere, establishes Harry's grace and charm...Jamie Lee Curtis shows she is indeed a sweet delight in the way she moves... This attractive star still has a great figure... Her arousing striptease is hilarious and sexy...Tom Arnold (Albert Gibson) does all of the background work in the van, while his partner Harry saves the world, in killing bad guys...Tia Carrere brings a sensuous style as the wild, hot-blooded psycho-seductress, driven by powerful ambitions...Bill Paxton becomes funnier as we get to know him... He feels lucky as Helen's enigmatic suitor, convincing the naive woman, through a series of "chance" encounters, that he is an international spy...Art Malik makes an appropriately super-villain especially considering what he is supposed to be portraying: the face of terrorism, with fanatical actions shaped by a fundamental antagonism against United States... You'll explode with laughter watching what occurs when our super hero tells him, "You're fired."With 'True Lies,' a vivid reminder of just how exciting an action film can be, director James Cameron gives us a film that plays for laughs enough that it works... Watch Schwarzenegger on top of the skyscraper wanting a horse he is riding to jump to another building... The $100 million in special effects are very impressive... The best example: Harrier fighters blowing out a bridge; and a standout scene that has to been seen to be believed:the rescue of Arnold's daughter with a Harrier Jetfighter...Six months have elapsed since (September 11th, 2001) that terrible day of infamy tore at America's soul... On Sunday, October 7, 2001, the United States and Britain began air strikes against Al Qaeda and Taliban targets in Afghanistan...I think each nation must struggle against violence and for peace... We will never eradicate terrorism altogether, but we can certainly minimize its destructive impact... This is not a fight against a specific religion or a culture of people... This is a fight for the right to live in democracy, freely and in peace... This is a fight to the end that the whole world must win...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a hoot! This might be Arnie's best, even though Jamie Lee almost steals the show.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had forgotten how funny this film is. From the very start it begins to laugh at itself and the entire genre, with great audacity. Every single scene is worth watching and I am still giggling about many of them. (Well, ok, the camera angle on the scene with terrorist-as-missile is a teensy bit overdone.) I delayed renting it again because I remembered the Jamie-Lee-as-prostitute scene was difficult to sit through--her predicament is just so embarrassing. But this time I discovered it is probably my favorite scene. She is just a scream (and surprisingly erotic), while her underplayed klutziness throughout is hysterical, right down to the tango at the end. Especially in contrast to her husband's ridiculously effortless physical skills and unruffled cool. The only time he loses it, and hilariously so, is with Bill Paxton. (And I love that she gets her own back for Arnie's sleazy trick. A woman who packs a punch.) Even the excellent special effects are pure humor. They are just huge enough to be ridiculous, and yet never seem overblown--and this with a nuclear explosion and a Harrier on an urban rampage. This film is a work of genius. How an action/espionage/romance spoof could deliver such outrageous tongue-in-cheek and yet never feel like corn, slap or déj? vu is a mystery to me. I give this 8/10 for being relentlessly entertaining, at a very high level. And the acting is top notch all around.</fullReview>

All the characters are wonderful, and the story is extremely gripping, plus Arnie and Jamie Lee Curtis are simply amazing in this!.The finale is simply incredible and is one of the most exciting ever, and i thought Arnie and Jamie Lee had amazing chemistry together, plus The ending was downright hilarious!. The chase scene with Arnie riding the horse, and Art Malik (the villain) riding the motorcycle, and i must say the famous dancing scene with Jamie Lee Curtis is fantastic, Jamie Lee is incredibly sexy, plus the supporting cast was great, and even Tom Arnold made me chuckle, and i always find him annoying!. The film is extremely exciting throughout, and some of the stunts were absolutely incredible, plus Arnie had some fantastic one liners as usual!

There are plenty of awesome explosions and even at 141 minutes it left me wanting more, plus Bill Paxton is great as the slime ball, and played his part extremely well. The dialog is awesome, and the opening was excellent, plus Art Malik, and Tia Carrere are extremely menacing as the main villains!. The Bathroom scenes will give you a lot to laugh about, and the score was very good, plus i though Arnold's acting was fantastic!.

		<shortDescription>Another excellent offering by Arnie and Cameron</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When people think of James Cameron, all that comes to mind is the first 2 Terminator's, Aliens and the dumb, sappy Titanic. But one film that is often overlooked on his profile is 1994's "True Lies" which differs in tone from Cameron's other darker films such as the before-mentioned Aliens the Terminator films. "True Lies" gives us a tone that is lighter and more comedic, but still packing the hardcore energy that Cameron is known for.Arnie Schwarzenegger plays a secret agent named Harry Tasker who is working for "The Omega Sector", also called "The Last Line of Defense" that fights against terrorism. But, to make it interesting, he hides his job from his thrill-seeking wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis in her best performance since "Halloween") and his daughter Dana, while fooling them into thinking he's a computer salesman. And Harry sets out to stop a terrorist from an Arabic country named Aziz (Art Malik in an excellent performance that will literally make you fear him and yet, he amuses you at the same time) from bombing America.And after the first hour the movie takes a break from the main plot and focuses on Harry's marriage to Helen and how he's going to fix it since he thinks she's having an affair, but finds out it's not the case. So we basically get 2 different stories here, one about Harry's job and the other about his personal life.Another performance worth noting is Tom Arnold as the witty Gib, and he should've at least won an award or two of some kind for providing most of the comic relief that makes this movie great. And also Bill Paxton as the woman-seducing Simon, really makes a name for himself here. Although, he isn't as great as he was in "Aliens", but he's worth checking out. Also, Arnie is shown in a more human character than all of the others that he's done, and the reason why it works is because he doesn't try so hard to do it like he did in his later movies such as "End of Days" and "Collateral Damage". In the scene after Harry and Helen escape the terrorists on the island, Harry puts his wife's ring on her finger and proceeds to kiss her. To me, this is the most humane film moment of Schwarzenegger's entire career and plus that scene after he rescues Dana from Aziz.Like any other James Cameron movie, the action is top-notch, the scene in the bathroom is one of the best I've ever seen since Arnie is basically fighting someone his own size and not a bunch of wimpy guys that he takes out with one punch each. Some of the stuff here may seem over-the-top to some people such as the the chase with the Aziz on the motorcycle and Arnie on horseback, and the scene when the machine pistol falls down the stairs and seemingly shoots every bad guy in the room. And of course, who could forget when he takes a fighter jet and soars through Miami and kills the terrorists in the building with it? But who cares? The point of it is that it's fun and was a fine competitor to "Speed" for the best summer action flick of 1994. Give it a chance, watch it, and just have fun with it....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrific action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a blast from start to finish. Based upon the French film "La Totale!" by Claude Zidi, TRUE LIES is one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's strongest efforts (not to mention his best acting performance). With James Cameron at the helm, and Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Arnold, the late Charlton Heston, Bill Paxton or Tia Carrere as supporting cast it was an easy sell, but still...Arnold plays secret agent Harry Tasker, top spy working for the counter terrorist unit Omega Sector. His wife Helen (Curtis) and daughter Dana (Eliza Dushku) think he's a computer salesman, while in fact he and his colleague Gib (Tom Arnold) try to thwart a conspiracy involving foreign banks assets, archaeological treasures and Middle Eastern fanatics. But when his wife begins an affair with a fishy guy named Simon (Bill Paxton), Harry uses the state-of-the-art technology from his agency to spy on her. Until both worlds collide...If you haven't seen this movie yet, I can't find words strong enough to encourage you to do so: this is easily one of the best 90's action flicks, and is better than most of the James Bond movies it's sometimes affiliated with (and that comes from a big 007 fan!). The blend of incredible action sequences and hilarious comedy is perfect, the cast shines like no other (special mention to Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis: rumor has it that Arnold was so impressed by his co-star performance that he asked to share the top-billing with her) and the script is a textbook example of how to pace an action flick. These days action movies are more often than not ridden with pacing problems, between set pieces too short, too few or far between, and unnecessary or badly written exposition (not to mention neutered PG-13 films) the genre has become the shell of its former self. Here, the script is amazingly tight, no loose writing, no fat. Only the best shots and scenes were kept and edited to give the best out of every aspect of the story.Not to mention that, even almost fifteen years after its making, the movie stands the test of time like few others. Hell, it puts most of the actual action flicks to shame. No stupid humor, no overuse of CGI, the movie doesn't skip a beat. James Cameron once again delivers a movie that tops its own genre. For what it is, it's almost flawless, and I can't find a single downside. A must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True Lies...Ahh just my favorite movie of all time! Arnie (Former Mr. Olympia, Terminator, Current Governator) plays a secret agent who has told his wife (Jamie-Lee Curtis) he is a boring computer salesman. He has to track down some Arabs planning to bomb the US AND stop his wife from having an affair with a guy who 'has to lie to get the girls because he has a small dick'(Bill Paxton) at the same time! His wife finds out he is actually a secret agent and they get captured by the Arabs and taken to the Florida Key's where the terrorists plan to blow up the nuke as a demonstration to the US that they have the power now! There are extremely funny scenes here including his wife's first attempt at firing a gun- namely an UZI- not a good choice for a first timer! Now they escape and the terrorists kidnap Arnie's daughter(Eliza Dushku)! He rescues them with a little help of a hijacked harrier jet. Great cast choice and excellent dialogue, plenty of sub-plots to keep you glued. Classic Arnie one-liners make this movie an awesome comedy while the stunning action sequences blends into the best Action-Comedy ever made!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie countless amount of times as with all the other arnie movies, but this is my favourite for sure. Whilst it doesnt rate as high in action compared to the other Arnie movies. This is definately arnies best comedy and with the above average action, it makes this movie Arnies best overall movie. Heaps of good explosions, shooting and hand to hand combat and hilarious comedy from all cast members. Art Malik and his men were hilarious especially when they were trying to be serious. Tom Arnold is perfect for his role, hilarious without even trying. But the funniest of all would have to be Bill Paxton especially while he is in the car with Arnie describing Jamie Lee Curtis to him and role playing a secret agent. Truely belly aching laughter! Tia Carrera and Jamie Lee Curtis were absolutely gorgeous. Who could ever forget that striptease by Jamie Lee Curtis? A 10/10 for me. I havent felt so good after watching a movie for a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So!! Dear!! What Exactly Is It That You Do For A Living?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything about this film was tailor made to be a resounding success!! The stars, Arnold Schwarzeneggar and Jamie Lee Curtis were immensely popular when this film came out!! Tom Arnold, is fantastic as the guy you love to hate, or dislike, or be annoyed with, or something!! The special effects to this movie were spectacular, as they garnered a largess of popular support from the movie audience!! The famous bridge scene with Jamie Lee Curtis dangling from the helicopter is considered to be one of the classic scenes of any movie made ever!! in the history of the silver screen!! The film, "True Lies" is incredibly entertaining as it oozes with charisma and testosterone driven theatrics!! Presently the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzeneggar is one of the all time box office big wigs in the wonderful world of Hollywood!! This movie is suspenseful, funny, clever, and above all else, innocuous entertainment which cries out: THIS IS SUCH A GUY'S MOVIE!!!!! I give it a perfect ten, see this movie, your perspective on the entire gambit of films is not complete if you do not see "True Lies" EXCELLENT!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People get killed in harsh ways!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie left me on the edge of my seat! Very cool. Lots of great violence! I had to keep rewinding scenes and watching them again because they were so cool. In one scene a man is just about to torture Arnold but then Arnold grabs him in a head lock, picks up a metal spike, throws it at a guard, which goes into the guards eye, then he harshly snaps the guys neck he's holding. Arnold then grabs a crow-bar, runs up to another guard and shoves the hooked end into the guys stomach. Another awesome scene is when Arnold gets a hold of two Uzzies. He just walks around for a long time, all big and tough, while pumping guys full of lead. The special effects in this movie are very realistic (such as people getting shot, necks getting snapped, spikes going in eyes, Arnold beating a guys face against a urinal). Long movie, but it couldn't be shorter. If you like to see Arnold slaughtering people, like I do, then go see this as soon as possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the few movies in the league of those like Kill Bill and Aliens which you can see over and over again without ever getting bored. James Cameron proves himself once again as the greatest director and writer of all time. Although Arnie and Bill paxton get so many mentions, Art Malik's performance gets little mention and his performance as always, is excellent. In the villainous role, no one can beat him. The "Low Battery" scene will have you on the floor every time you see it and is perhaps the most memorable movie scene of all time. This movie is completely insane and completely rocks. Its hard to see how anyone could possibly dislike anything about this movie? Its also one of the few which has a very satisfying ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bit Sleazy But Memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy, I haven't seen this in quite a while but I did watch it several times in the mid '90s and usually was thoroughly entertained. It's pretty long at 141 minutes but I don't remember anyone ever complaining they were bored watching this. The combination of spectacular action scenes and humor made this a big hit.Tom Arnold has the best part in here with light-hearted humor, albeit on the sleazy side (but that's Arnold, for you.) Speaking of "Arnold," there's Schwarnegger giving us one of his better performances, and Jamie Lee Curtis doing what she does best: showing us her incredible body. She, like Arnold, was profane and not the most moral of persons. Of course, with a James Cameron-directed film, you are going to get a lot of characters like that. It ain't going to be Mary Poppins. You are also going to get a Hollywood action staple: an overblown, too-long action ending. This one features some parts that are so outrageous that you almost have to laugh out loud. Then again, a lot of this story is tongue-in-cheek so a lot of the absurdity here fits.This film has a couple of scenes that you never forget, from Curtis doing her striptease to some incredible action stunts.. It's anything but intelligent, but it is entertaining, big-time. I'll give it that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True Lies is my favorite movie of all time! I have seen True Lies over a hundred times, no lie! I can recite almost all of the lines. Ever since I was a little kid I have been in love with this movie. True Lies never gets old, if I had to choose one movie to watch for the rest of my life it would be True Lies! Arnold is my favorite actor of all time and True Lies is by far his best movie! True Lies is the reason I love action movies. The movie is a perfect combination of action, comedy, and story line! James Cameron does an amazing job of making this movie epic. The action scenes are incredible! The one liners are perfect and hilarious. Arnold plays Harry Tasker, a husband and father that has a secret life of being a spy and has to take out the most dangerous terrorist organization while dealing with family problems. Tom Arnold gives the performance of his career, he will have you laughing the entire movie. If you have not seen this movie you are seriously missing out on a classic. I recommend this movie to everyone especially to all Arnold fans. As much as I love the Terminator movies, I believe True Lies is James Cameron and Arnold's best movie. I give True Lies a 10 out of 10! A++</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Agent Arnie to the rescue.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eager to add a little spice to her mundane life, housewife and mother Helen Tasker (Jamie Lee Curtis) falls for the lies of slimy used-car salesman Simon (Bill Paxton) who masquerades as a spy to lure desperate married women into bed. Matters get out of hand when Helen's hubby Harry (Arnold Schwarzenegger)?who she believes to be a computer salesman, but who is actually an operative for top secret government agency Omega Sector?discovers that his marriage is in trouble and uses all the resources at his disposal to give his wife the excitement she desires. Harry's plans go awry, however, when the group of Middle Eastern terrorists he has been tracking interrupt the fun and expose Helen to more danger than she could ever have dreamt of.James Cameron and Arnie Schwarzenegger are a match made in action-movie heaven, and True Lies, their third film together, is yet another incredible slice of jaw-dropping action goodness, a cinematic adrenaline rush that plays like James Bond on steroids. The film clocks in at a mighty 141 minutes (although by Cameron's recent standards, that could be considered short), but there's not a moment that drags: from the breath-taking stunt-packed opening sequence, to the incredible pulse-pounding finale in which Arnie pilots a Harrier jump jet to rescue his daughter (played by a young Eliza Dushku) from the clutches of evil head-terrorist Salim Abu Aziz (Art Malik), this film is a pure delight.Arnie has never been better, delivering witty one-liners, snapping bad guys' necks, blowing stuff up, and even dancing the tango like an old pro, and his co-stars are just as great, Curtis miraculously transforming from a dowdy housewife into an absolute sex-bomb (she may not be a great beauty, but my god that woman is built), Tom Arnold providing excellent comedy relief as Harry's Omega Sector partner, and Charlton Heston stealing every scene he is in as Harry's grizzled, scarred, eye-patch-wearing boss. And even though the film is now 17 years old, it still looks the business, the special effects having aged incredibly well, and Cameron's skill behind the camera proving that you don't need flashy editing gimmicks to make a scene exciting if you know what you're doing.Now that Arnie has quit mucking around in politics, let's hope that he and Cameron can get together for a few more projects, and that one of them is a sequel to True Lies: Harry Tasker deserves at least one more chance to blow away loathsome terrorist scum before rheumatism and senility finally set in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent action comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A terrific film, very fun, very over-the-top. It is incredibly difficult to make a comedic action movie which works. Far too often, the jokes come off as ridiculous, corny, or simply frustrating (think any of the latest Bonds), or they clash violently with the too-serious subject matter. It takes talent to piece together a film with the precise balance of comedy and action, good and evil, without turning away hard-core action fans. This film is a great example of that balance achieved. Think about how difficult it is to pull off considering the rather extreme body count in this film, and the grave subject matter (nuclear annihilation). At no time does the viewer roll their eyes at lame one-liners, instead there are some truly impressive action sequences, and some very amusing comedic moments mostly from Tom Arnold in what has to be his best role of his career (unfortunately, that is not too hard to back up given some of the fantastically bad movies he has been involved with).Schwarzenegger is at his best. And Jamie Lee Curtis was very effective first as his dowdy wife, then as his partner in crime. She pulls off her role beautifully, and was both funny and appealing. The bad guys are evil, the good guys are funny, and the whole is stitched together around some fantastic stunts. Not very believable to be sure (a Harrier jet backs into a building 50 stories up, and then flies away??), but that is part of the super-spy mystique.A fine adventure, well casted, well acted, and certainly well scripted. It is generally not known, but this film was a remake of the French film La Totale! which I encourage Action Fans to see. You will be very surprised at how faithfully True Lies remains to the original French script. The only real difference is that True Lies is bigger, more expensive, and more explosive. Other than that, the movies are virtually identical.Great remake! R.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky, but fantastic entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(teeny-weeny spoilers!) I don't often go to the cinema, but I did see true Lies when it came out, and loved it. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a secret agent, hopping of on glamourous &amp; dangerous assignments all over the world. Meanwhile his wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) thinks he's a rather boring salesman and knows nothing of his "true lies", until.... This is a really "quirky" movie. it can't make up its mind whether it's a comedy, a drama, or an action movie, but that DOESN'T detract; it makes it quite unique. The direction is near perfect, but what else would you expect from Jim Cameron? Big Arnie shows he CAN act, and Jamie Lee Curtis is simply WOW!! as both his 'shrew-like' wife and the "vamp" she turns into.But, my favourite was Bill Paxton as the oily used car salesman whose fantasy world becomes horribly real. He is HILARIOUS! I can still hardly believe this is the same guy who played Brock Lovett in Titanic. I'd say this was Arnold's 3rd best film (next to T2 &amp; Kindergarten Cop) and very well worth watching. It's a scream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Cameron's most underrated movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Cameron is one of my favourite directors and Arnold Schwarzenegger is my favourite action star and 1994 was probably one of the best years for movies ever with movies like Pulp Fiction, Leon: The Professional, Forrest Gump and The Shawshank Redemption. All those movies are masterpieces but True Lies was one of the most underrated movies of 1994. I'm a big fan of the first two Terminator movies and after three years we got a Cameron/Schwarzenegger and it turned out to be a great success even though it may not be as good as Aliens or Terminator 2 or Titanic. It mixes action, comedy and romance and it also takes some elements of James Bond and Rambo. It's a pity we didn't get a sequel out of it but if there was a sequel I doubt it would be as good as the first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Octane 90s Action Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 90s were great time for big action films, with films like Terminator 2, the Bond films, The Rock, Con Air, the Die Hard films and many more being released. One of them was comedy-action-thriller True Lies, a loose remake of a French film helmed by the great James Cameron and led by his Terminator star Arnold Schwarzenegger.Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger) is an American spy (despite having a thick Austrian accent) for a black ops agency investigating a terrorist organisation called Crimson Jihad with his team, Gib (Tom Arnold) and Faisal (Grant Heslov). Crimson Jihad, led by Aziz (Art Malik) is spectated of buying four Soviet nuclear weapons and plan to use them against the United States. But even worst for Harry is that finds out his wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) might be having an affair with a used car salesman, Simon (Bill Paxton) who is pretending to be a spy.When I was younger I disliked True Lies, seeing it as an American attempt to make a Bond film. My opinion has soften and I see it for what is, a fun action-comedy. Its winning features are its action sequences and its quick pacing. It is never a dull film and Cameron is of course one of the best action directors around. There are plenty of fight scenes, shoots outs and chases. True Lies uses a combination of partial effects and excellent CGI for the time. The action is memorial, particular the first action sequence, the bathroom fight and chase in Washington D.C., the battle on the island and the highway chase. The Cameron was to make the action over the top, adding to the lighter, comic tone.Whilst True Lies works very well as an action film, the comedy is much weaker elements. There are some funs little jokes, but Cameron is naturally a more serious director. The worst offender of the humour comes from Tom Arnold who is not a funny comedian and his character came off as obnoxious more then the likable comic relief. At least Schwarzenegger has some one-liners and has the action chops, but of course he is not renounced for being the best actor.The other major problem is the detour the film takes when Harry stops his investigation into Crimson Jihad and follows his wife when he thinks she is having an affair. It was not funny and it led to a cruel, sadistic and creepy subplot as Harry uses a lot of government resources to follow his wife. It stops the film dead. The subplot should have been played different, from Harry trying to keep his secret identity from family or Helen finding Harry's identity by accident.Plot wise True Lies has a perfectly fine plot for a spy action-thriller for the time. Of course we have much more understanding of Islamic terrorism then pop culture did back in 1994. The plot was actually so similar to the plot the Bond series was going to use that they had to change it: but of it worked out for the best because we got a fun film with Arnie and one of the best Bond films with Goldeneye. Whilst I did compare True Lies to Bond there is enough differences to make True Lies its own film. There are some homages/parodies such the use of a gadget and Harry going to high society event (with the beginning being a clear reference to Goldfinger). If you enjoy the Mission Impossible films you should find enjoyment from True Lies.True Lies is a fun experience and is a fine addition to the high octane 90s action. Cameron and Schwarzenegger have better films in their filmography but True Lies is still good comfort viewing if you fancy an action fix. I would have liked to have seen a sequel made but sadly that is not going to happen now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnie doing what he does best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Helen Tasker believes that her husband sells electronics for a living? he doesn't; he is an agent working for a secret US counter insurgency agency. His most recent mission has provided data suggesting that a terrorist organisation is planning to smuggle four stolen nuclear warheads into the United States. It appears that beautiful art importer Juno Skinner may be involved in the smuggling and when Harry goes to see her he is spotted by the terrorist leader Salim Abu Aziz; a chase ensues as Aziz tries to have Harry killed. This leads to Harry getting home late; to make up for it he decides to take Helen out for lunch but as he enters her office he overhears her on the phone; it appears that she is having an affair. Distracted from his work Harry sets about discovering the mystery man with the help of his partner Harold. As they listen in it appears that the man she is seeing is also an agent of some sort; or so he claims? Harry must take drastic measures if he is to save his marriage. He might have been distracted but the terrorists haven't and they grab him and his wife; just as it looked as if he'd saved their marriage their lives are in danger as they must both fight to stop Aziz.This Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle is a lot of fun; it feels very much like a Bond film but with much more humour. The laughs don't seem forced though and the action isn't much more over the top than most films of this genre? even though we see Arnie chasing a terrorist through a hotel while on horseback and rescuing his daughter in a Harrier jump jet! The action is solid with plenty of fighting, shooting and explosions; all very exciting without being too gory. Arnie puts in a fun performance as Harry and Jamie Lee Curtis is great as Helen; few people will forget her sexy dance scene! Art Malik makes a fine bad guy and Tia Carrere portrays Juno Skinner with just the right mix of sexiness and psychosis. Coming from James Cameron one expects great action and special effects and for the most part he doesn't disappoint; although some of the close-up shots of Arnie flying the Harrier do seem a little fake; that is a minor quibble though. If you are a fan of Arnie of action films with some good laughs this is a must see.</fullReview>

I had forgotten what a "big" movie it is, and yet, the humor keeps it from ever taking itself too seriously, and this is a movie that includes all too believable terrorists, nuclear bombs and harrowing near-death shoot outs.

		<fullReview>I have seen every movie Arnold has made, and the truth is, most of them are not particularly memorable. TRUE LIES is, perhaps because of its very large budget, its sometimes distinguished director, its script, its eye popping stunts, or all of the above. Also, Arnold is paired with a genuine actress as his costar, and that helps immensely. TRUE LIES may in fact be Arnold's crowning achievement. Well, there's also PREDATOR. Buying him as a secret agent here is a stretch, but then, TRUE LIES is a comedy. And a fantasy, like a James Bond movie. For those who have never seen it, the pursuit along one of those vast bridges in the Florida Keys is this fast-paced film's best sequence. And the interaction between Arnold and Jamie Lee Curtis is not to be missed. Tom Arnold is the comic relief, and for once, he's not all that bad. He gets to utter the funniest lines, of course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Arnold Blockbuster Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"True Lies" is an action film that is literally a blast. Directed by James Cameron at a reported budget of over $100 million, "True Lies" stars Arnold Schwarzenegger in his best film to date as Harry Tasker, a spy who passes himself off as a computer salesman to his family. Terrorists are creating havoc in the U.S., and its his duty, along with his partner Gib hilariously played by Tom Arnold, to stop them. The first part of the film has some great stunts and action sequences. Then in the mid portion of the film, things start to get complicated. He finds out (or thinks he's found out) that his wife Helen, played by Jamie Lee Curtis, is having an affair. This part of the movie turned off many viewers, but not me. It kept my attention. Then in the last part of "True Lies", that is were we get to see some incredible super-duper stunts, action scenes, and special effects. And that is why "True Lies" is a must-see for any fan of action movies. While watching the last part of the film you can see why this movie cost so much, and I think it was well worth it. But it also has great comedy and terrific performances by Schwarzenegger (who's great as usual), Arnold (who provides most of the laughs), and Curtis (who won a Golden Globe for her role here). "True Lies" is lots and lots of fun.</fullReview>

The movie is almost flawless &amp; highly enjoyable in every terms. Perfect star cast, good story line, awesome screenplay, action at its best.The beginning of the movie gives you the complete feel of James Bond movie Goldfinger. Arnold plays his character perfectly as I feel writers kept Arnie in mind to write the story of this movie. The tango dance of Arnold &amp; Juno are one of the best scenes in the movie. The movie begins as Arnold as a spy &amp; lie about his work to his wife for 17 years trying to be computer sales rep. The best part of this movie is the villain plays by Art Malik, the movie is incomplete without his presence. The restroom fight is one of the best scenes ever in this movie. The movie has two stories running at same time, the fight against terrorist &amp; on the other Arnold thinks that his wife is cheating on him. It takes you completely off the movie for half n hour. Jamie lee Curtis performs one of the best erotic dance ever on screen way too sexy. Of course the movie also has some of the best adult humor. The background score suits the movie perfectly. Action at its best the sea link scenes are breathe taking, perfect camera angles, action very well executed. This is one of the finest movie from James Cameroon.My rating 10/10</fullReview>

People use derogatory terms like "popcorn flicks" but at the same time, would they ever admit that they don't see movies or go to the cinema for the sheer fun and excitement of it?

The film is Schwarzengger's most complete action film and his best role of his career. Jamie Lee Curtis and Tia Carrere do a terrific job as the heroine and femme fatal respectively. True Lies(1994) is an action flick with a sense of humor.Tom Arnold contributes to the movie with his off beat antics as he is the Ying while the other Arnold is the Yang. there are a few reasons why I enjoyed watching movie. First, the action sequences were breath taking and well executed. Second, the funny one liners of Arnold Schwarzengger. Third, the lap dance performed by Jamie Lee Curtis in the hotel room.True Lies(1994) is better then the average big budget action blockbuster feature. True lies(1994) along with the Ipcress Files are the best of the James Bond inspired movies. In fact, I consider the movie to be superior to the last few Bond films because it feels fresh while the Bond movies are repeats of the early films in the series. True Lies(1994), and Aliens(1986) are my favorite James Cameron motion pictures. James Cameron is the David Lean of Action/Scifi feature films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw "True Lies" in the theatre, I recall thinking that digital screen effects and steroid muscle effects have really upped the ante for action films. When Arnold reveals a tuxedo under his wetsuit I thought, "this is the direction the moribund James Bond films should be heading."Time has not proven me exactly right, perhaps. Still, this is one of the few films I'd really like to see a sequel to. Now that the Arnold character doesn't have to lie to his wife anymore, they could go into business together as equal-opportunity action spies. Can't you picture it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some lame comedy almost ruins it--but the action more than makes up for it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It literally took me three separate attempts to make it through this movie; perhaps I was holding Cameron to exceedingly high standards based on previous outings, because I really had to turn my brain off to be able to enjoy it. Once that little feat was accomplished, it's actually an enjoyable ride. The comic elements tend to fall flat, and I think that's what annoyed me initially, but Tom Arnold is cast perfectly and does a great job. The action sequences (except for the comic-bookish opener) are worth a look, especially the white-knuckle finale--Huzzah! So sedate your critic, turn up the surround-sound, and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply FANTASTIC!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read all your comments about `True Lies' and some were really... well, interesting. They made me laugh out loud several times. Seems like some of you missed the point about this movie. Maybe you've watched too much of this mainstream action stuff. You take this movie too serious. Didn't you get it??? The movie doesn't take itself serious for one minute! Before I saw this movie I thought it was only one of those action movies with a lot of explosions and without a story. I admit that I just bought the video because it wasn't expensive. But it is so much more than that. It has a really original story which is hard to find in an action movie and it's a funny parody on James Bond films. Forget `Titanic'! This is James Cameron at his finest! It was definitely worth the 100,000,000 $-budget. All actors did a great job (I never thought Arnold could be so funny), especially Jamie Lee Curtis who plays his wife. It is interesting too see how her character develops and without that the movie would be less fun. Some of you complained about that dancing scene... I think you know which one I mean. I don't believe this is useless. It kind of belongs to the development of that character and it is sexy and funny. Maybe some of you just didn't expect something like that in an action movie. That's why you find the middle act of `True Lies' boring. In fact, there are two stories: Harry has to save the world from terrorists who want to detonate four nuclear warheads and he also has to save his marriage. The second thing is unusual for an action movie, but it is never boring. This is what makes the movie special. Do you think the movie would have been better with only the usual `good guys vs. bad guys' story? It couldn't be better. It's PERFECT!!! This is all I can say. It will always remain my favorite. So far, I've watched it 20 times and I always loved it. I hope, Cameron will soon make a sequel. If you missed this great movie, get the video (or DVD), make some popcorn, invite your friends and just enjoy it! Rating: 10/10Just a note for `True Lies'-fans: Download the original screenplay by James Cameron on www.script-o-rama.com! To Shan-12 from Australia: I've never read such a stupid and unqualified comment.</fullReview>

Amazing, this guy always wins somehow! The supporting cast is perfect, couldn't have been better, the action scenes scream "Cameron" and the dialogue can never be more humorous!

		<fullReview>James Cameron is well-known, especially because of his "Titanic" blockbuster, for gargantuan special and visual effects in his films, but those spectacles have been always accompanied by serious and/or violent storylines. "True Lies" can be called a new venture for Cameron in that he now chooses to have a lot of fun with his work. One mistake I believe bashers of this movie make is avoiding the fact that it is in many respects a comedy. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Cameron are merely just toying it up with explosions, cliffhangers, shootings, and moronic bad guys. And what a fun toy it is to play with. The famous bridge sequence has to be seen to be believed. Fine performances can also be found in this flick, including Jamie Lee Curtis as Arnold's unsuspecting but ready-for-action wife, and Tom Arnold as his wise-cracking but engaging sidekick. I received a real surge from "True Lies," not only because I got to see a lot of stuff blowing up, but that for once, I had a load of fun doing it. Rating: Three stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True Lies is an action comedy which works on nearly every level.The story is original. Harry is a master spy in the James Bond mould, but has a cover as a mundane computer salesman. His wife longs for excitement and is beginning to harbour thoughts of straying. Meanwhile, Harry is involved in combating a terrorist plot to steal nuclear weapons.All the story elements work and weave together well. All the cast members are excellent. The concept plays strongly towards Schwarzenegger's strengths as both an action hero and a comedy actor. But Jamie Lee Curtis must get the top award here for a fabulous performance full of both comedy and drama, topped with a dance which manages to be highly erotic and hysterically funny at the same time.The action and effects are excellent, with one moment which is completely unbelievable but has you shouting "YES!" and punching the air in victory anyway.Huge, huge fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great white 'Lies'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: One of Arnold's smartest and most exciting vehicles, directed by none other than James Cameron. Approaching TRUE LIES with expectations for pure Schwarzenegger fare may help, but it also gives you more than you bargained for. Packed with state-of-the-art action and non-stop special effects pay-off, TRUE LIES is also surprisingly strong with never-too-little bits of humor. Every frame of this, surely the best Schwarzenegger film since TERMINATOR 2, is packed with moments showing James Cameron's capabilities as a top-flight action director. In his previous efforts, Cameron used special effects wonderfully, but only treated them as machines to work out his imaginations with. TRUE LIES is no exception, and the special effects here, mostly during the slam-bang climax, are superb, but he never lets his stars and story undermined by effects.Big guy Ah-nuld gives an underrated performance (perhaps his best) as Harry Tasker, a secret agent unknown to his wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis, brilliant here) and rebellious daughter (Eliza Dushku), who joined by his wisecracking partner (Tom Arnold) are sent on a mission to pursue a deadly international terrorist (Art Malik) who may be responsible for a bunch of stolen nuclear weapons. In the mean time, Harry also discovers that, due to his absences as a family man, his wife is already getting involved with another man. Thinking she may be cheating him, Harry keeps his watchful eye on her, but still makes sure he keeps his identity and career as a secret agent undetected.The film has its share of neat and exciting action scenes, including a neat chase scene where Arny chases a motorcycle-bound baddie while making sure his horse (literally) doesn't go tired on him. Then there's the explosive conclusion, a fight atop a large Harrier-type jet which is a triumph of stunt-work and outstanding visual effects. But when the action sets backstage for comedy, the film is more than saved. Arny and an enjoyable Jamie Lee Curtis look great, together or apart, especially when it comes to a comedic approach. Cameron has already proves his talents as an action director in many other films, but in TRUE LIES, he also reveals his capability to provide strong and offbeat bits of humor, and he rarely loses his stride. While it's pretty long at 141 minutes, TRUE LIES knows how to keep the audience tuned in, and it has more tricks up its sleeves more than you think! Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True Lies is one of my most favorite films of all time. Everything is here-action, romance, comedy, whatever you want. Arnold, Bill Paxton, Art Malik, Eliza Dushku, Tia Carrere: everyone has done a great job. I'm a die hard Eliza Dushku fan and I wanted a bigger role of her in this action masterpiece. She perfectly played the naughty daughter of Arnie and Jamie. But I was disappointed to see Jamie Lee here; although she is 11 years younger than Arnie she looks 11 years older!! She has a very unattractive and disliking face but I'm not saying she is a bad actress.Arnold was fabulous in action and comedy, Art Malik played a very tough villain, Bill was absolutely funny and entertaining, Tia was voluptuous and a perfect cast for the role. Every actor's acting was remarkable in this $110 million budgeted film and it should be earned over $200 million but finally it grossed only $146m in US. I think all action fan will love this film.</fullReview>

This film needs a higher rating here in IMDb and on Rotten Tomatoes maybe a 8.1 or a 8.3 and a 84% or an 88% on RT.

		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron have been such an efficient Hollywood duo for so many years. Sure, they aren't DeNiro/Scorcese or Dicaprio/Scorcese in terms of the Oscar caliber performances, but they have been or I should say were a prolific couple in terms of making purely enjoyable action flicks. And there's perhaps no one better at action than The Terminator himself Arnold Schwarzenegger. True Lies is at its surface a pretty goofy action comedy, but there's more depth to it than at first glance. Arnold is at the top of his game and Jamie Lee Curtis gives a surprisingly gripping performance.I knew the film had a comedic side, but I guess I didn't realize that it's more Fast and Furious than it is Mission: Impossible. But lets make something clear here, this film's premise works way better with the comedy than it would without. With that being said, I don't think some of the leaps the film made in terms of Curtis' arc were needed. She's definitely a beautiful woman, but in the long scheme of things was the dancing sequence really necessary? Plot wise it just didn't add up why Harry would go about revealing himself in that way. I also thought the second half of the film took a bit of a step back with the lack of Tom Arnold's comedic relief. It took a few scenes to get used to his comedy but when his jokes hit, they hit hard. In many ways his performance carried the first half of the film.In addition to this film being very funny, the action is spectacular for 1994. The film's look is very late 90's and early 2000's so I can see where someone may think it looks dated. But the special effects and action choreography were way ahead of its time. But that's nothing new with James Cameron. It was also funny to see Bill Paxton show up and have fun in his short role, another one of Cameron's frequent collaborators. Charlton Heston's glorified cameo was a nice touch, but there wasn't much closure on his side of things. And finally Brad Fiedel's score was also a pleasant surprise as he did both Terminator films with Cameron. So in all, True Lies is a blast of an action film that tends to get too unrealistic at times, but the performances of Arnold and Curtis make it an unforgettable 90's action comedy, and lets be clear, Cameron is the real hero here.+Special effects +Arnold's having fun +Curtis' coming out party +Tom Arnold -Too goofy at times 8.1/10</fullReview>

The visual effects and the action sequences are fantastic. It even throws in a bit of comedy. This is just a very fun, high octane adventure! Jamie ended up winning a Golden Globe for her performance, which is soo deserved! Arnold deserved one too in my opinion, just saying. And Bill Paxton is in too, cus he's in literally everything! But I thought he played his screwed up perverted character very well. I thought Jamie's transformation at the hotel was pretty impressive, how she changed from conservative housewife to a sexy hooker in a time span of 30 seconds! It was cool how they gave her a chance to walk on the wild side, to let loose, since in the movie, she felt caged in and just so uptight. I feel James Cameron brought us another great one! 8/10</fullReview>

Arnold's awesome, as usual. Terrific role for Jamie Lee Curtis. Probably the last 'great' movie of either star. Tom Arnold is also lots of fun. Young pre-Buffy Eliza Dushku is Arnold &amp; Jamie's daughter and plays a big part in the climax. Bill Paxton is hilarious in his small but important role. It's an exciting blend of action and comedy. Well-directed by Cameron with an excellent cast.

It's definitely not the best film of maestro J.Cameron but any other mainstream movies director would have declared this picture as his carrier achievement. That's how good "True Lies" is. It has amazing visual effects (no wonder here), great humor, terrific action scenes, and good plot for this kind of a movie. The ending with a jet is still one of those scenes where after 20 years you wonder: "how in the hell did they pulled that of"? If by any chance you still haven't see "True Lies" do your self a favor - take some friends, beer, turn you phones off and enjoy this slick classic, it's one to be seen again and again.

		<fullReview>Eons ego, i remember to have seen in theater the original french movie « La Totale » with my family as it was released for Christmas 1991. If « True lies » is its remake, it's funny to learn that the french movie had plagiarized a not produced script as well ! Then, I have also watched « True Lies » at home with my family and i found it rather boring. But, now that I plunge into Jaime's cinematography, I pick it again. Honestly, this second watching really benefits to the movie. In a way, it has two sides : First, It's a action movie and there, « true lies » offers really great sequences (except for the tedious opening in Switzerland) as they are totally innovative and non-seen before (the horse pursuit, the accidental gun, the plane pursuit). Second, it's a comedy and it's really funny ! All the twists of the french movie are here and if it's hard for Schwarzie to speak as usual, Jamie is a wonderful pick as she truly evolves from fragile wife with glasses to strong partner !</fullReview>

Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger) leads a double life, with his wife (Curtis) and daughter (Dushku) thinking he is just some boring sales rep when he is actually performing covert missions for the U.S government under a counter-terrorism task force. Jamie Lee Curtis has a steamy striptease that'll make your eyes widen, but Cameron knows not to corrupt the film's tone by crossing the line that separates sexy and erotic; and Tia Carrere is just? well? hot. Non-stop action and non-stop laughs. Everything works so well in this outing. Extended remake of the 1991 French film LA TOTALE! Most expensive film ever made at the time of its release, and is the first film to have over a $100 million production budget. Tom Arnold (who almost didn't get the part) makes the movie worth seeing; and let's not forget Bill Paxton's performance as? well? just watch? it's worth it. It's almost sad to watch the movie now, as it takes you back to a time where we could afford to feel comfortable about taking terrorism lightly.**** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis have done it again! Wait, have they ever done it together before? I don't know. Welp, they did it together in this movie! But wait, will they ever do it together again? Not sure. Don't ask me. Ask them. They should. What I do know is when I first saw True Lies, I said to myself, ''Hum, that was a really good action movie, hmm''. And that was that. Life goes on. Months pass, even years, and at some point I watch the movie again and the thought reenters my mind, ''You know, that True Lies movie, that True Lies movie was really good, hmmm. Very well done action. It almost stands out in that area of action as being greatly superior from other action films, huh''. What could it be? Ah well, life goes on. Time passes, months, even years. Then someday somebody, or someone, or something comes up to me and says, ''Hey, you ever seen that James Cameron flick True Lies? It's goooood.'', to which I reply ''James Cameron? James Cameron did True Lies? I had no idea!''. Ohhhh so that's why True Lies is so awesome, James Cameron did it! I didn't know this until years after True Lies was released and that's why it always stood out from the pack as being so greatly superior. Point being, quality is as quality does. Quality is quality no matter where it comes from, or whoever made it (I think that's the point). It's no coincidence. True Lies clearly has great writing and direction. True Lies is so outstanding in the action genre because such a special filmmaker made it. It does an exceptional job of presenting the action in the right frame and focusing on mostly the action above anything else. In many lesser action films, the action hero will toss a grenade at a small group of terrorists and the camera will show the grenade land, a scared look from a few terrorists, and then an explosion sending terrorists flying through the skies, then camera cut back to the action hero who trots away very pleased onward to take out the next band of baddies. That's focusing on the action star. Focusing on the action, as True Lies does, shows Arnold toss a grenade in middle of a few highly flammable explosive barrels, terrorists panic, the explosion sends terrorists through the air, to the ground, and some up in flames serving as a distraction for Arnold to then shoot out the lights causing more confusion and mayhem as the terrorists scramble allowing Arnold to continue tactically attacking the bad guys and push forward. It focuses on the action, not the action star. It follows the action through to it's logical conclusion and shows it. Makes sense, even though me explaining it does hardly. True Lies has great editing, something seldomly seen in action blockbusters. True Lies has great editing and detail, something seldomly seen in action blockbusters. True Lies is a great movie with awesome and unapologetic action and some of the very best special effects and big budget action sequences ever seen on film. True Lies needed a much stronger relative storyline. The main plot of True Lies isn't action oriented however. It is about the struggling marriage between Curtis and Schwarzenegger in him leading his double life as a top secret agent being forced to live a lie with his wife by keeping her in the dark. True Lies is funny, entertaining, and sexy. One scene in particular is very sexy. You know the one. Jamie Lee Curtis is a total knockout wearing that black minidress and she looks even better when she strips it off. The 35 year old Jamie has a spectacular athletic build. Her cleavage looks really rocking! Not to mention her nice bum (I'm glad I didn't). Jamie Lee Curtis dancing around in her all black thong bra and panties is just one example of how True Lies is such a great all around feature production. Good Lord, Jamie Lee Curtis, you really got it going on! I love you! True Lies is fun action and is really funny and Jamie Lee Curtis is really sexy. Arnold is great in this movie, too, he really is. True Lies is awesome. True Lies is a man's movie, made by a man, and some other men, and probably some women too surely, for men, and well, women, too. I love True Lies!! It's awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny action flick, no lie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the many action flicks starring Arnold Scharzenegger. Here, Arnold plays Harry Tasker, who leads double lives of a government agent to some and a computer salesman to his wife and daughter. He is on a trail searching for Islamic terrorists who stole of bunch of nuclear weapons and, at the same time, have to deal with the fact that his wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) is seeing another man. Harry decides to juggle both tasks of spying on his wife and pursuing the terrorists, resulting in one wild and hilarious adventure.I first saw this movie in a high school government class as part of our end-of-semester celebration and remembered that our entire class had a blast watching the movie, just having a great time laughing at Arnold's funny one-liners and cheering at the thrilling action scenes, especially the runaway car chase and the terrorist pursuit in the heart of the city. The funniest part was when another teacher walked into our classroom, right when the movie showed Helen's pole-dancing scene in front of Harry, resulting in a combination of awkwardness and laughter from the class as the teacher made a funny face. In addition to the thrilling and sophisticated action sequences, I thought the story was clever and intriguing, especially the double-life aspect of Arnold's character, and thought that the acting was good. Director James Cameron really kept the momentum of the plot and story going for a 141-minute movie, thanks to all the intriguing character development and script elements, all leading to a thrilling good guy vs. bad guy climax. Not as cheesy as some of Arnold's other action movies - just a great combination of action and comedy with a dose of drama sprinkled on. Grade B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a man famous for playing a dead pan robot, or a muscle bound soldier, this is probably Arnies best comic outing, as he gets to be both the action hero and have a life in a more believable (if you can ever say that about him) manner than his previous film, Last Action Hero, but keeps the action high compared to his more comic films; 'Twins', 'Junior' and the awful 'Jingle All The Way'. Curtis works well as the disenfranchised wife. She's living with a spy, a man of action, adventure and international mystery, yet - like so many romantic leads in superhero films - she can't see through his disguise. She lacks all the excitement his days have, tries to capture it for herself and the result is predictably comic. Tom Arnold plays the sidekick for laughs. Given the life and death situations they find themselves in, he seems very quick with the jokes, though a stronger comic would likely have over shadowed Arnie. Rather than being the main storyline, the nuclear terrorists are a back drop to marital strife, and it's easier to explain to your other half why you're working so hard and never home when you're actually saving the world, rather than just believing you are.</fullReview>

This movie is one of his weakest in terms of innovation but if you are looking for a funny action thriller that makes your day then this one is just perfect. Harry Tasker played by straight faced Arnold is a secret agent for the United States Government. For years, he has kept his job from his wife played by terrific Jamie Lee Curtis, but is forced to reveal his identity and try to stop nuclear terrorists when he and his wife are kidnapped by the terrorists. James Cameron fills the movie with crazy situations, over the top but funny action scenes, delicious dialogs, weired side characters and with some family moments. Even villain also gets some funny scenes. Climax scene where Arnie goes full blow flying a fighter plane is worth your ticket. Watch it if you are looking for lots of good action with lots of good fun.</fullReview>

Director James Cameron is quite a master as an action director, and in this one he adds a dash of humor. Tom Arnold is actually funny in this. Schwarzenegger is able to play up his action hero persona and marry it with a family man facade. It is great fun. The only awkward thing is Harry grilling his wife. It does get us to Jamie Lee Curtis in the sexy thong. So there's some good that results from that. It's a great ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were punchlines, there were hidden jokes and extremely awkward moments (in my eyes) at some occasions, but most of all the climax was just amazing. The tango was horrible I have to admit, the dance was awfully done but it was still fun to watch and see Arnold put on his sexy face but also, of course, see him dance! Maybe for the first time in an awfully long time I actually paid attention to an action scene. The jet plane and helicopter scene was really well made. It was something new to look at and not just two big guys hitting each other on the abdomen until the other one makes a gory painful face and goes into slumber or, plot twist!!, the main character dies! Ha ha no but the jokes aside I really enjoyed the scene. There was something about fighting in the air that triggered my interest. The way Arnold protected himself by turning the plane sideways from the shooting was so clever and well thought of I would be disappointed if no one noted that moment. Then we have the insane "terrorist" who is stupid enough to stand on a plane and not expect the pilot to do something about it so he would fall off. To be honest I didn't thought about it myself until it happened which made me feel pretty stupid and then amused. This movie was great and it's a shame it hasn't gotten a higher rate than just above 7. Aside from the horrible tango the movie was excellent!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie about lies and deception, with machine guns to boot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about the lie. The lie that one man uses to hide is real self from society and in essence his family. To most people he is a boring computer salesman who travels all over the world - in reality he is a secret agent. This movies deals with a lot of lies and appearance and reality is a major theme.There is Simon the used car salesman who poses as a spy to fulfil his sexual needs. This fantasy is completely destroyed when he chooses the wife of a real spy to seduce. Where as the real spy is very secretive and boring, Simon is quite open and exciting - apparently. The truth is that they are the opposite. Even then, Harry Tasker (Arnold Swartzenegger) is not what he appears to be either. He is a spy who sees lots of action and lives a quite exciting life - but when it comes down to being a husband and a father he is in fact quite naive. He doesn't realise that his daughter is stealing money for drugs or abortions (the reason is never revealed, just that she does steal money) and when his wife makes a comment about sleeping with the plumber, he ignores it. It is only when his wife has an affair that he responds, and in a way that it can happen to others but not to him.The revelation of the lie also plays a role in this movie. Even though Harry lies, Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) is not allowed to. Harry knows the truth and tries to expose her unfaithful nature by asking her questions. Even though Harry is disappointed that Helen is being unfaithful for lying, we later see exactly the same thing happen to Harry when his unfaithful nature is revealed Helen. It is not sleeping with somebody that makes one unfaithful, it is the lie. As Harry lied to Helen for fifteen years about being a spy makes him just as unfaithful as Helen.This exposes a weakness in Harry's character, and that is his family. This is exposed quite near the beginning when the movie takes a side track away from the main plot line. In fact, the side track is quite major and occupies us for quite a while. As this side plot is happening, we do not know what is going on elsewhere. This side track diverts us from the real action of the movie and as we are enjoying a rather seductive dance, Cameron jars us back into reality by bringing the main antagonists back into the movie. It is not at all clear how the antagonists knew that Harry and Helen were in the hotel room, they in fact quite unrealistically turned up, but this shall be looked at later.It seems that relationships are explored slightly and the writers seem to be confronting those of us who lock ourselves away in our work. Simon tells us that he seeks out the women whose husbands are more interested in their work than their wives for they are the ones who are seeking fulfilment in a marriage - they are the ones looking for excitement. Harry's best friend quotes, "Helen is a flesh and blood woman: she is going to need something and he is never there." Too often we treat marriage and girlfriends as a status symbol for ourselves in society and we do not look into the true relationship side of things. Dana (Harry's daughter) needed a father but because he was never there she sought one out among her peers. If we want a good family, a faithful wife, and children who respect us, then we have to be prepared to but that time into it. Or children will respect us more if they are certain that we will be there for them.Helen is an interesting character for she starts on the fringe and looks like she will remain on the fringe but in reality she does not. The affair with Simon brings her quickly into the centre of the movie, and the abduction makes her one of the central figures. We see that Helen does change through the movie, and this change is noted at the end when she is seen with long hair. This is an interesting contrast for the hair is usually shortened to symbolise a woman becoming stronger and independent, but this is not true with Helen. In the movie she is a timid, gullible woman, and at the end, when she knows the truth, she is much stronger, though more submissive to Harry.Humour makes its way into the movie. The whole situation with Simon is quite humorous the first time it is seen. This is generated through us knowing more than he does. Harry's naivitee adds much to this comic subplot. The movie also uses one liners to infuse humour (though they get a bit dull after seeing tonnes of them in tonnes of movies). Some movies (Running Man) seem to thrive off them; True Lies does not.The end scene, where Harry and Helen have joined forces, to me, is quite stupid. It seems to be there to tie up all of the loose ends and would have been more effective if it were not for that one last laugh at Simon. Though the idea is good, the execution of this idea was not. To me it is highly unbelievable for a used car salesman to land up as a waiter in a foreign dignitaries mansion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My name is Schwarzenegger , Arnold Schwarzenegger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Schwarzenegger and Cameron join forces for the third time . This time in this semi-parody of James Bond . The action here is over the top like in Bond movies. Personally , I watch it more like a comedy than action movie. It's cheesy and unrealistic, but that's kinda the whole point of movie.Schwarzenegger is surprisingly good in the main role. Tia Carrere is hot and so is Jamie Lee Curtis (especially during certain dance scene). Good support from bill Paxton and Charlton Heston. The movie is quite long , yet it moves fast and it's never boring. The only complaint I have is the interrogation scene , which is done with bad taste. I understand the need for that scene , but the bitter taste remains.Technically the movie is perfect. The special effects deserved the Oscar nominee.Overall , it's a good action comedy. It's one of weaker Cameron's movies , yet it's satisfying. I love the philosophical question : "What kind of sick b**ch takes the ice cube trace of out the freezer ?". I give it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Truth About Lying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sorry." "Sorry, sorry!" "SORRY!" says agent Harry Tasker. Repeatedly.Is it about lying in True Lies? No, about all the destruction he causes and knowing the true Arnold Schwarzenegger, I'm sure he improvised that into the film.Aside from that and the meandering in between multiple and unnecessary subplots, I truly liked this film. It helped it was, unbeknownst to us all, the second to last great Schwarzenegger-helmed projects for a long time (1996's Eraser is the last great one, until 2013's fun The Last Stand premiered.) Also, aiding in this film's success was the unapologetic R-Rating ? I miss those movies and the fantastic and often hilarious performance from Jamie Lee Curtis. (Okay, you can include the mostly funny Tom Arnold.) Further, this was when Director James Cameron was having fun and making a quality living. (Later, he would get sucked into the clichéd-heavy world of Avatar and sadly, not look back.) Finally, I love the gorgeous Tia Carrere and was saddened that she rarely starred in anything big beyond this and the Wayne's World films.'Double lives' movies weren't even new back in 1994, but thanks to the all-around performances and direction, True Lies made it feel fresh, and fun. In a thin, though normal-for-the-90s-action genre, plot, Schwarzenegger's Harry has a nice home life with a wife, Curtis's Helen and a boring ? to her, albeit fake, job. Truly, he's a spy and is trying to thwart a terrorist attack in Florida. And no, it's not to end the fantastic Golden Girls TV series ? that ended in 1992. But, since this movie was likely filmed in 1993, perhaps it was to end the terrible Golden Palace spin off that happened that year.That leads to this, this to that and Helen gets caught up in Harry's lies and despite the movie being fun (and funny) up to that point, the sh|t hits the fan and it gets even better with Curtis's role expanded in the last half.Now, you seriously cannot take this movie seriously, and like most 1990s action, this movie has more plot holes than Arnold had mistresses. And, I can forgive most of them. What I couldn't was the length and the over-the-top cartoon finale. (SEE: jet skiing in the air.)The movie was far too long (141 minutes!) and when we do get to that unintentionally laugh-out-loud climax, you'll agree that, despite how much fun the audience had up to that point, it should've been edited down a bit. Oh, wait, it's Cameron we're dealing with here. Never mind. He doesn't cut anything ? he only produces gold, or so he'll tell you.Overall, despite a few drawbacks I had with the film ? "Sorry!", overall, it's a fun ride and one of the best Schwarzenegger films in his collection.Side Note: As mentioned, for a period of almost 20 years, this was Schwarzenegger's second to last fantastic movie. The same goes for Cameron. His follow-up to this was the masterpiece Titanic. Sadly, aside from some water-related diving films, and the ho-hum of Avatar, he hasn't come back as Schwarzenegger has. I'm still waiting to see a great Cameron-directed film like before?Titanic, True Lies, Terminator 1-2, The Abyss, Aliens?anyone, anyone? No?we get, the blah Avatar, and he wants to spend his remaining days on Earth doing?three sequels to those. Seriously? Come on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arnie and James Cameron team up again for a deliberately over-the-top, often amusing spy adventure, a homage to Bond, and perhaps Scarecrow and Mrs King too - it was based on a French short, La Total.It opens up with a neat homage to Goldfinger as secret agent Harry Tasker - Arnie - sneaks his way into the swimming pool of a mansion in Switzerland, and when he emerges, takes off his wetsuit to reveal an immaculately pressed dinner jacket underneath. As the mission goes sour when accosted by a guard upon leaving, we get the first epic action setpiece, a sign of what to come.When it's back to the States, we learn Harry has a wife - Jamie Lee Curtis - and daughter - Eliza Dushku. While Harry is concentrating on catching terrorists who may have in their possession a nuclear weapon, he's only beginning to realise his family life is falling apart, with his wife being courted by a sleazy used car salesman pretending to be a spy in trouble - Simon played to perfection by Bill Paxton, another Cameron regular.This mid-section may put off those who just want to watch things blow up, but stick with it. Just as an attempt to fix his marriage is about to backfire horribly, Harry suddenly finds himself kidnapped by the terrorists he's pursuing, and now his wife is involved. At this point, patient viewers are rewarded as the film proceeds to deliver breakneck action, from Harry's escape, his rescue of his wife, and his battle with the terrorists while flying a commandeered Harrier jumpjet.A little less taut than it should have been, but an action fan's delight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Bill Paxton, Tom Arnold, Tia Carrere, Art Malik, Eliza Dushku and Charlton Heston star in James Cameron's 1994 action film. Schwarzenegger (The Terminator) plays Harry Tasker, a man who has a wife, Helen (Curtis) and teenage daughter, Dana (Dushku). He has one problem, he's been leading a double life as a secret government agent which they don't know about. Arnold plays his friend and partner, Albert Gibson, Heston plays their boss, Spencer Trilby, Malik (The Living Daylights) plays Arab Terrorist, Salim Aziz and Carrere (Wayne's World) plays his assistant, Juno Skinner. Helen eventually discovers the truth about Harry after she gets mixed up with sleazy car salesman, Simon (Paxton) and shares the action experiences with him. This is a good action flick with some funny moments, great action sequences and Schwarzenegger &amp; Curtis are great together. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What do you get when you add James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger- AWESOME!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Cameron is a director that I admire for his passion and effort he had with his movies. Terminator 2, Aliens and Terminator. I even at times, really admire the effort he put into Titanic but definitely not for Avatar. Seeing as this is a 90's Cameron movie, with Arnold, I was really excited to watch this movie despite a surprisingly low IMDb rating compared to other Cameron movies.True Lies is simply a spy movie. A married man, for a good 17 years (or so) has kept it a secret to his wife that he is a secret agent instead pretending that he works for a computer software company. The film pretty much follows the story of Harry, his wife and his friends as they prepare to unscramble this mystery...The movie has great acting, a lot of funny moments, rusty acting by Arnold and great acting by Jamie Lee Curtis. However, the chemistry between Arnold and Curtis is fantastically done and the two share many funny moments. Cameron's directing was not lost after his immense success in Terminator 2 and he made a whole new fresh movie! The story is great in the film, the characters are entertaining, the visuals are fantastic after such a huge budgeted movie but the movie can also be a little disappointing.The movie's action is very limited early on and at parts, the comedy dwells down and is replaced with a lot of emotional scenes. At few moments, the inconsistency in the tone can be a little frustrating but overall, doesn't count as much of a negative to the movie as comedy can somehow be incorporated into this.'True Lies' is not Cameron's Aliens nor is it his Terminator movies. Its a great acting comedy movie that delivers very well but may be a disappointment for those expecting T2. A great action flick of the 1990's</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cameron and Schwarzeneger play Bond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very interesting to watch this now, it's a film you couldn't really make after 9/11, what was escapist fantasy then now seems all too plausible reality, Omega Sector a dead ringer for Homeland Security complete with wiretapping and enhanced interrogation. I heard that the reason that they never made a sequel was that it simply wouldn't have worked amidst the real life War on Terror. The Good; Great performance from Jamie Lee Curtis, still gorgeous and a housewife who loves her husband but just wants a little more excitement in her life, love her little tremble with the coffee pot when he asks her how her day went. Surprisingly good performance from Tom Arnold as Schwarzenegger's sidekick and Tia Carrere is effortlessly sexy and devious as the villainess. Almost unnoticed amongst all this is a very young Eliza Dushku as Arnold's daughter who will grow up to become a fan-boy lust goddess and find fame and fortune in 'Bring It On' and Buffy/Angel. The causeway chase is truly terrific, thrilling and funny, people actually got up in the cinema and clapped when they do the amazing stunt of pulling Jamie Lee Curtis' character clear of the limo's sunroof as it falls away beneath her (presumably in those pre-CGI days that was actually done for real?). The nuclear kiss scene is great, nice cameo from Charlton Heston and the portrayal of espionage is not actually that inaccurate, the sequence with Schwarzenegger and Tom Arnold in the helicopter juggling phones and radios as they try to organise everything is very true to life. The Bad; I know this is an action comedy but the depiction of the Arab terrorists is still so clichéd as to be borderline offensive, you wonder how much they had to pay a great Indian actor like Art Malik to take this role? That said his speech to the video camera does put his point across and is a dead ringer for some of the real terrorist propaganda videos you see nowadays. The action scenes aren't bad, especially the hotel bathroom sequence but sometimes come across as a little cartoonish, especially on the island. All told a great film but very much off its' time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Tasker is a sales Representative for a computer company, with a wife, Helen, and a daughter, Dana, with a house in the suburbs. Or so everybody thinks. Harry is an agent of an organisation that hunts down any threats. While he is investigating a possible threat on the U.S., his wife Helen becomes lonely and starts to see another man, a used car salesman, so Harry secretly uses his organisation's equipment to monitor on his wife and her new friend. A middle eastern terrorist named Aziz, has formed is own terrorist network he calls "Crimson Jihad" and they are threatening to Nuke the U.S. if they do not get what they want. Harry must stop the terrorists and hopefully, save his personal life.After his career low with Last Action Hero, Cameron came to the rescue with this, one of their best collaborations, and one of the best action movies of the nineties. It's easily the stars and the directors last great movie, as Arnold only had Eraser after this, before his star really did fade, and Cameron decided to be king of the world and let his ego take over him.It's a brilliant movie, a proper summer blockbuster, when you could really tell where special effects had been used (in a good way), and when expensive movies where rare.It was also a time when the stars name alone would sell a movie, so this was a huge deal for Schwarzennegger.The set pieces are awe-inspiring, the chemistry between the two leads makes the comedy work that little more, and the final hour of the film is just plain bonkers.Scenes like pelican landing on a balancing vans roof, a bad guy panicking because a battery needs changing, and everyone's favourite, the cleaner listening to music while all hell is breaking loose are included here, shouldn't work, but make the movie stand out just that little bit more.It's prime Arnie, he hasn't been this good since, and although it sags a little in the middle, it rarely let's up.A fundamental movie for action fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quality action film - Arnold hasn't bettered it since</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True Lies has pretty much all of what defines a good action film - a rapid beginning, plenty of pyrotechnics, several exciting action scenes where Arnold (literally!) avoids death by a few metres, spectacular stunts and plenty of ass-kicking by Arnold Schwarzenegger. However, there are a few other things that set True Lies above the pack. The first is the director: James Cameron. However you may feel about him personally, the man has a proved pedigree when directing action movies with Schwarzenegger. He shows that pedigree here by inserting some classic 'Arnie' humour to relieve otherwise tense scenes (Schwarzenegger criticising the horse for being a 'bad cop' and telling his wife that the guys he killed were "all bad"). The second is the effective 'buddy cop' interplay between Schwarzenegger and Tom Arnold (?!). Sometimes they're as thick as thieves, sometimes they're quibbling over their wives. I especially laughed when Schwarzenegger shattered the SUV glass after Arnold's character wouldn't give him the script of the interplay between his wife and the used-car salesman.The third is the examination and development of the relationship between Schwarzenegger and his wife after Schwarzenegger learns of her 'extra- curricular' activities and after his facade his exposed. Many action movies use some sort of hokey, cringe-worthy romance with the main character. This is more interesting though, because Schwarzenegger's character (Harry Tasker) is already married and has to rekindle a romance to save his marriage. It's funny to see how he uses all of his agency's resources to do so. However, is the film perfect, or on par with the first two 'Terminator' films? No, not quite. For one thing, Art Malik and co. fail to convince as villains the way that either of the two bad Terminators did. Malik's character comes off as a nut-case, but he lacks the menace and cold sense of purpose that makes a great villain. Tom Arnold is still a limited comedian so sometimes his routine falls flat, while Bill Paxton is more of an all-round actor than a great comedian. As such, he is sometimes funny as a used-car salesman (especially when it is implied that he wet his pants), but sometimes he's just irritating. The likes of Carrere and Dushku are fine but don't need to do much other than be sexy and act like a hysterical teenage daughter, respectively.On the other hand, Jamie Lee Curtis is good: firstly as a wife, secondly as somebody who wants an adventure and thirdly as a fish out of water in Arnold's 'real' life. She conveys a whole range of emotions here. I could've done without the strip-tease though; what was she, in her mid- 40's by this time?! It must also be said that Tom Arnold is probably at his peak here. The movie doesn't always pace itself perfectly; there's certainly a spectacular beginning and end alongside ample action, but I feel that they spent a little too much time in the middle examining the relationship between Tasker and his wife. Perhaps it would've been better for Schwarzenegger to discover what his wife was up to when he was in a more action-packed situation or some such. The movie may have dragged a bit less. However, these are relatively minor quibbles. True Lies is still a quality action movie which stands up well above the pack. It is probably not one of James Cameron's best movies, but it's a mark of his quality as a director that Schwarzenegger has not starred in a better film since. As such, I have no problem giving it:4/5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, okay. This is no life-changing deep, heavy, sob-your-guts-out movie. But it is very nearly perfectly fun! You want entertainment? This is it!Arnold Schwarzenegger is just plain charming in all his comedies. Check out "Junior", "Twins", "Jingle All the Way" (less so), and, maybe best of all, "Kindergarten Cop". The man has serious comic chops! This was HIS role. And he did it perfectly. His dazed recital to his torturer of, step by step, how he was going to kill said torturer is worth the price of admission all by itself. So is his admonition to a horse which let him down ("What were you thinking?"). There are some brilliant comedy deliveries here, and they tell me comedy is the hardest thing of all.Jamie Lee Curtis has never been better, never sexier, than she is here. Watch her odyssey from an ignorant housewife to a competent help-meet to a master spy. She pulls it off hilariously and totally believably.My biggest surprise was Tom Arnold. Until I saw this, I thought he was Rosanne Barr's half-wit ex-husband who had used her celebrity to find his fifteen minutes of fame. But his performance here is STELLAR! Arnold and Jamie Lee are delightful, but the real sparkle in this comes largely from Tom. The biggest laughs in this movie are his. He takes good lines and delivers them to perfection.As for the plot: okay, so it's totally unbelievable. It's an Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie. What do you expect? A nuclear explosion killed "Predator" and Arnold came striding out, sweat-soaked and filthy, but alive. Verisimilitude? What's that? And who cares? He's sliding down a snow-covered slope, on his back, firing his pistol as he goes. Yeah, right!Remember "Hasta la vista, Baby"? Watch for "You're fired." Every bit as good.Are you looking for some serious fun, a wonderful distraction from reality? It doesn't get better than this!</fullReview>

Anyway, what can I say about True Lies. Arnold plays a spy, his wife played by Jamie Lee Curtis gets entangled in some crazy stuff and wants to be a spy as well, the next thing we know, Arab terrorists are trying to create WW3 by smuggling warheads into the States. WOW! Anything more I have to say. The cast was great, the action was off the hook and there were some comic moments. The one thing that will stay in my mind when I think of this movie is the chase through DC between Arnold and Art Malik. From the streets to the Hotel roof, it was a blast. This movie I always recommend to any Schwarzenegger or action flick fan. Overall, this gets a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

This movie shows why Cameron is a beast at making action films. He showed it with Terminator 2 and Aliens.This is about a special agent who is known at home to be a computer salesman. When his family gets involved in his affairs after being attacked by terrorists, he must save the day and disclose to his family his real identity.The acting is what you would expect it to be. Arnold is just plain Arnold running around and beating people up. Jamie Lee Curtis wasn't bad like I thought she would be.

		<shortDescription>Masterful action direction, terrible second act.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get this out of the way now: James Cameron knows how to put together an action scene. His direction is incredibly precise. It hits all the right moments while still feeling fresh and exciting. However, he reminds me a bit of John Woo in the sense that sometimes his movies are long and he doesn't know when to quit. The middle section with Jamie Lee Curtis seems to go on forever and will have you squirming in your seat. Even if some individual scenes during the midsection are good (Arnie's stares, certain lines, etc), the whole thing feels drawn out. If the whole point of it was to get Jamie Lee in the arms of the badguys so Arnie could reveal everything, they could have done it in 5-10 minutes. Instead you get the subplot with Bill Paxton as the sleazebag and Jamie Lee's marital issues. But to what end? There's no satisfying payoff to it. The ending would have had the same impact had the middle been shortened to half its current length. I don't want to sound like a stuffy critic - hell, i want more action - but the second act could easily have been shortened and improved.</fullReview>

In the end the scenes with the fighter aircraft are so improbable and unrealistic you can't help laughing! But you still enjoy the overall result. Great job by Arnie and Jamie.

		<fullReview>This in my view is one of Arnolds best ever movies. A superb start gives way for continuous action right up untill the end, and Tom Arnold's character adds some excellent humour yet at the same time not undermining the films plot. Superb special effects and a good running time earn True Lies a 9 or 10 star rating, although the ending does get a bit tiresome. Watch out for True Lies 2 next year!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerhouse action thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The operative word is "thriller", the thrills come fast and furious in this film from director James Cameron. This Cameron's third film with star Arnold Schwarzenegger, and behind "Terminator 2" I think that this is their best film together. The stunts and special effects are breathtaking especially the scene towards the end of the film where harrier jets blow up a bridge. It is arguably one of the best scenes of visual effects ever put on screen. (Though the scene it self doesn't look like special effects). I can hardly wait for "True Lies 2".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cameron and Arnie team up again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the Terminator films under their belts, director Jim Cameron and tough guy Arnold Schwarzeneggar collaborate yet again to bring us their version of big-budget Bond, American style. With this film, Cameron decides to drop the dark themed movie look for an action blockbuster with a touch of comedy. However, where the action is top notch, the attempt at humour doesn't suit either Arnie or Cameron.Overlong with a ridulous sub-plot, the writing here is grade B. What really works, though is the stuff these guys are used to doing...killing bad guys, and providing some truly amazing stunts and special effects. Good performance from Tom Arnold. Watch out for Charlton Heston as Arnold's boss.</fullReview>

It is an action-comedy-adventure like no other and it is simply fun to watch. Similar to many Bond-movies it is much better (everything is neater: the story, the cinematics, the FX, and the actors -- with the exception of Connery, the one and only Bond).

		<shortDescription>Great climax but alarmingly crass and misogynistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When "True Lies" opened, there was much comment that Cameron's blockbuster would blow the James Bond films out of the water. Well, Bond continues on his successful way and there is no sign of the promised "True Lies 2". The problem with the film is that it is an uneasy hybrid between a big action movie and a smaller character-based drama. The opening is terrific and the climax is one of the best ever in an action film. But the mid-section storyline, where Arnie suspects his wife of infidelity, not only slows the film right down but is unpleasantly cruel and misogynistic. Are we really meant to be identifying with a "hero" who suspects his loving wife (falsely), misuses Government resources to spy on her, and who then terrorises and humiliates her? Even the Bill Paxton character, slimeball that he may be, is unlawfully and unpleasantly treated. This aspect of the film seems to tie in with the "might is right" approach that governs so many of Schwarzenegger's films, including the supposedly humorous ones like "True Lies" and "Jingle All The Way".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1994. The year which saw the summer which I like to call "the summer of movies which went on longer than they should". Jan DeBont's "Speed" is an example. James Cameron's "True Lies" is another."True Lies" is the story of Harry and Helen Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis). They live in a beautiful home with beautiful furnishings and seem very financially secure. Harry and Helen love each other, except Helen is beginning to feel neglected. Seems Harry doesn't have much time for her. Or their teenage daughter Dana (Eliza Dushku). He's always away on business as a computer salesman/technician. Or so Helen thinks.No, folks. Harry is not cheating on Helen. He's away on business, alright, "company" business to be sure, but the business has nothing to do with computers. See, Harry Trasker is a special agent with a super-secret U.S. Government spy agency. His adventures with fellow agent Al Gibson (Tom Arnold) frequently happen at all hours, anywhere in the world. He's never told Helen because not only is his job ultra-secret, he never wanted her to worry.Because of this miscommunication, Helen begins to drift emotionally toward another man named Simon (Bill Paxton) who has been intriguing her with spy stories and his adventures of derring-do. But he is actually a sleazy used car salesman. Harry begins to suspect Helen is about to become unfaithful and with Al's help and a bit of fraud, waste and abuse of Government facilities and equipment, discovers Simon's real identity and sets about psychologically torturing Helen (forgetting he created the situation by not being honest in the first place). In the backround of all this is a madman with a plot to take over the world. Don't worry, though. All will work out in the end."True Lies" is a prime example of James Cameron excess with little to no character development. The film is a glimpse into the future to 1997, when Cameron will spin completely out of control with "Titanic" (I don't care that "Titanic" made over $600 million box office dollars-it's still an example of elementary school writing and sensibility). And, like "Titanic", "True Lies" telegraphs every plot turn well in advance. Still, "True Lies" has some well done, fast paced action sequences, great special effects (the air attack on the Key West bridge is awesome) and sports an excellent understated performance by post-Roseanne, charismatic Tom Arnold. This film proves Tom Arnold is a good actor in his own right, regardless of what Roseanne what-ever-she-wants-to-be-called-now has said publicly about him. The rest of the cast seems to be just going through the motions.The last twenty-five minutes of "True Lies" should have been left on the editing room floor. It blows any sort of believability the film earned prior right out of the water and seems to have been tacked on. After all, Cameron had to lengthen the suspense by placing daughter Dana in danger, right? Cliche and unnecessary.I suppose "True Lies" could have been worse. But it also could have been so much better. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schwarzenegger's Finest Film to Date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arnold is in top form in True Lies, his follow up to the disastrous, yet entertaining Last Action Hero, and James Cameron's pre-Titanic, post-T2 directorial turn. Action packed and fast paced from excellent beginning to incredible climax, True Lies is not only Schwarzenegger's best film to date, but features his best performance as a harried spy who must keep his clandestine occupation a secret from his wife, the terrific Jamie Lee Curtis, and his grunged out daughter.All supporting players are wonderfully cast and give great performances, especially Tom Arnold as Arnold's Harry Tasker's witty and crass partner, Albert "Gib" Gibson. Also look for a surprising and amusing cameo by screen legend Charlton Heston as Schwarzenegger's boss, Spencer Trilby.The special effects-laden action sequences make the film, but so does the comic interaction between the characters. Even after the great Eraser in 1995 and especially after the dreadful Batman &amp; Robin in '97, True Lies remains my favorite Schwarzenegger movie, and is one of my top picks for best spy film. It truly does satisfy the viewer, Arnold fan or not.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"True Lies" is James Cameron's quick follow-up to his wildly successful "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" and, although the chase sequences are utterly outstanding, it is the action movie auteur's least work to date. Now, don't get me wrong, I liked the film fine, I just think that it doesn't work in many scenes and Cameron is definitely at his weakest in the writing department.Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Harry Tasker, a super secret agent who passes himself off as a boring computer salesman to everyone, including his bored wife Helen (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) and rebellious daughter Dana (played by Eliza Dushku).Intriguing premise? Yes. Does it play out to the best of its ability? Well, in short, it's not as good as it could have been. I mean, yes, Cameron is still the technical genius of big-budget filmmaking and the best of the best when it comes to staging action sequences.However, the middle act of "True Lies" is a surprisingly savage romantic comedy. I don't think it degrades women as much as some critics seem to exclaim, but it is a little offbeat for a movie claiming to be a total action extravaganza. It's just a little out of place, that's what I mean. It sort of pulls the rug out from under the performers' feet. We learn that, despite his intimidating brawl and funny one-liners, Schwarzenegger's acting talent is limited and Curtis is sort of played out here as a screaming, desperate nerd girl.Still, when the adrenaline level is on high, "True Lies" is one fast-paced, entertaining, high-voltage action flick. It's just too bad it had about forty minutes that really take something away from it. Rated R. 141 minutes. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think Jim Cameron has made a film which hasn't been entertaining. This is a change of pace from his previous efforts which is welcome. People should take the film for what it is - a comedy spoof of spy movies. When viewed in that context, then it is hugely enjoyable fluff. The director crafts a movie that is enjoyable as an action movie, a James Bond spoof, and as a comedy.While it is pretty forgettable (apart from a hilarious performance from Bill Paxton as the sleazy car salesman), there's no denying that it's fun while it lasts.7/10.</fullReview>

The only downfall of this movie is the weasel-like and overwhelmingly annoying "performance" of Tom Arnold. How he got into a film of this magnitude is beyond me. Otherwise I rate this movie four of five stars for it's unusual twist on a classic Bond style secret agent style film and inventive use of tactical weapons.</fullReview>

The funniest moment for my mother and my brother was the part where Jamie Lee Curtis does a sexy dance along a bed post and falls down. The action scenes were really good, if implausible.

		<shortDescription>A James Bond movie without James Bond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't my idea of an actor. His background is in bodybuilding, not theater, movies, or even TV commercials. Furthermore, his name is hard to spell (I spelled Arnold correctly, didn't I?). But he is a movie star, perhaps the biggest in the world, which isn't too surprising since he makes BIG movies. "Terminator 2" and "Total Recall" had budgets and box-office grosses that made Arnold himself look puny, and 1994's "True Lies," though no match for "Forrest Gump" at the ticket windows, is in the same mold. It has another thing in common with Schwarzenegger's other films: it's boring.Oh sure, it's packed reel to reel and frame to frame with incredible stunts and state of the art special effects, but where in its 2 hour and 22 minute running time is the humanity or even a coherent storyline? Action is all "True Lies" has to offer, which may be enough to satisfy most viewers, but to watch Arnold battle and prove victorious against the baddies, there should be a context, a way of becoming involved in his plight. Not surprisingly, the filmmakers didn't have time for that. Presenting the characters as something other than cardboard cutouts would take time--time better spent on what the producers hoped would lure audiences to the theaters in the first place: action.Directed by James Cameron, "True Lies" is a bit more interesting than most of Arnold's films because it is an homage of sorts to James Bond movies. It opens with a scene strongly reminiscent of 007's entrance in "Goldfinger." Schwarzenegger emerges from a lake (river? pond?) in black scuba diving gear. He unzips and is now impeccably dressed in a tuxedo. After a hot dance with Tia Carrere at the social event he's crashed, Arnold detonates a bomb, and, now, in a scene that echoes "On Her Majesty's Secret Service," our hero flees on foot while pursued by assassins on skis. Arnold's adventures take him underwater ("Thunderball"), in the air ("A View to a Kill"), and, as in dozens of Bond films, into the lair of his enemies. "True Lies" might just as well be titled "James Bond's Greatest Hits," but it's missing one crucial ingredient: James Bond himself.In 1963, when the first Bond film was released in the U.K., heroes were fairly down to earth guys dealing with fairly down to earth problems. "Dr. No" ushered in a different kind of hero; one who faced danger with a wry smile, an arched eyebrow, and a quip or two. The Bond films had virtually no suspense--who ever doubted that 007 would not emerge victorious and embark on another adventure?--but they worked because they weren't really action adventures so much as they were parodies. They mocked movie star heroics. The fun was in seeing just how Bond would escape from the often wildly imaginative traps the enemy set for him and the ultracool manner in which Bond confronted what would, for a more realistic character, be certain death. Still, as played by Sean Connery, Bond could perspire. When Roger Moore took over the role, the series was reduced to a live-action cartoon."True Lies" is also a cartoon, one that rehashes and tips its hat to, and in a sense pokes fun at, James Bond. But since Bond was always something of a joke himself, what does that make Arnold and the other folks behind "True Lies"? The ones who never understood the punchline?</fullReview>

In this movie director James Cameron adds a lot more comedy with the usual roller coaster action we are used to from this awesome director.The characters are great :Ahnuld has a lot more lines than in the terminator movies and manages his role with a likeable flair. Tom Arnold is hilarious as Arnold's buddy,a nd Jamie Lee Curtis...well...watch the "stripper" scene you'll see how amazingly sexy she can be ( even though she is more eyecandy when compared to Cameron's other movie heroines. )The movie is a blast,with killer stunts and special fx and a lot of laughs sprinkled in between. The climax with the harrier jet will blow you away,b ut stangely the very last scene where Arnold and Jamie have a romantic tango can be just as satisfying because we get to interact the quiet moments with the characters as well as the (VERY) loud ones and that is one thing we don't get from many action movies nowadays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely one of my favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In some ways, I view True Lies as a superior form of the James Bond movies; we never really saw Bond-the-man. Arnold has to live a lie every day with his wife and kids; probably a tougher job than his real work, if truth were known.True Lies has some classic Arnold action, and while this is important to the film, it is not the sole component, as in Predator. Here we have the wife about to stray, and a daughter who steals money from his partner.It's a difficult choice, but I think my favorite scene in the movie is when Arnold's under the truth drug. She asks if he's ever killed anybody; his reply is yes... but they were all bad. When the evil doctor comes in, Arnold tells him exactly how he's going to kill him, then reveals that he's picked the lock on his handcuffs.Yes, you need suspension of disbelief to watch this movie, but it IS a lot of fun. And yes, Bill Paxton is good at playing slimy jerks (see him in Weird Science, if you doubt me).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film desperately unsure what it wants to be. The first and final third are standard action pieces whilst the middle is a moderately entertaining comedy. The film neither excels or fails at either but you feel that the studio found one action script about terrorists, another about about a lying spy-husband and tried to combine them with so-so results. Schwarzenegger and Curtis are good (Arnie probably puts in his best performance) but the film is hijacked from under their noses by Tom Arnold and Bill Paxton (who is superbly slimy). Cameron leaves his fingerprints all over the film and handles the set pieces with his usual style but full-on comedy just might not be his forte. All-in-all a good film that's hard to fault but not as excellent as the credit list may lead you to believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cameron and Schwarzenegger get it done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the closest we'll ever get to an Austrian-American playing James Bond, Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as special agent Harry Tasker in "True Lies," a spy thriller with towering feats of action ? and a few issues back home.James Cameron adapted the film from a little-known French movie three years its senior called "La Totale!" Essentially, the film imagines what a top-secret spy's domestic life would be like. Harry Tasker loves his wife, Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis), but he lies through his teeth to her all the time; kind of hard to avoid when some days you're trying to make it home from Switzerland in time for dinner."True Lies" opens in pure James Bond fashion. Harry swims his way into a well-guarded estate where a party is being held, rips off his wetsuit to reveal a tuxedo and walks in to the mansion where he pretends to know everyone and then steals some key files related to potential Middle East terrorists. His escape involves explosions, a chase down a mountainside with bad guys on snowmobiles and skis and a license to kill. Schwarzenegger manages to exude some suave here and continues to prove why he was simply born an action hero.Tasker works for Omega Sector, self-touted as the "last line of defense." They're basically the CIA. Tasker works closely with Albert (Tom Arnold), kind of his intel guy and a dry-humored pessimist. They're hardly the best duo of the '80s/'90s, but they're different. Together, they go after terrorists.The film has a distinct three-act structure. The first introduces spy Harry and Omega Sector and develops the terrorist plot. The second starts when Harry tries to make up for never being home and discovers that his wife is meeting some kind of mystery man, which spins into something absurd. That "diversion" really kills the film by making it seem schizophrenic until the third act brings it all together and ups the stakes tremendously and in redeeming fashion. Cameron's a gift action director, but the film walks a weird line between action and humor. Much of the humor works, but the second-act, which houses most of it, goes on for too long. There are memorable moments with Harry and a used-car salesman and most famously Jamie Lee Curtis doing a little dance in lingerie, but those seem much better in retrospect once you've seen the entire film. During, however, they feel unimportant and wasteful.How Cameron manages to imagine the action sequences in his films is anyone's guess. Harry chasing a terrorist while on horseback into a Marriott hotel certainly hasn't been done before. From an action standpoint, there's simply no lacking in excitement. Its that very ingenuity that helps the film overcome its dual nature in the third act. Most filmmakers probably don't possess the skill to crawl out of that kind of a hole, but Cameron has that skill and then some.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insanely entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I have yet to decide whether "True Lies" is a better comedy or action film. It contains heavy elements of both and plays them equally well." --James Berardinelli.Indeed, few films are as wildly entertaining as "True Lies." It's the definitive film of the action-comedy genre. Most films that contain both, sacrifice one at the expense of the other. For example, "Die Hard" had a few good one-liners, but it's main purpose was to send the viewer for one hell of a roller coaster ride. These days, the PG-13 rating is king, so it's the former; action is lessened and neutered and in it's place are jokes and gags. Those can be fun, but James Cameron has pulled out all the stops for his unrecognized masterpiece, "True Lies."Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwartzenegger) is a boring computer salesmen, or at least that's what his wife thinks. The truth, however, is the complete opposite. Harry is a secret agent working for the US Government, doing what Arnold does best: blowing away countless bad guys in the most outlandish way possible. But his two lives are about to collide: it turns out that his time spent saving the world is leaving his wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) alone and bored. To add a little spice to her life, she's getting involved with another secret agent named Simon (Bill Paxton). Also in the mix is a creepy terrorist named Salaam Abu Aziz (Art Malik) and a gorgeous historian/art collector/businesswoman named Juno Skinner (Tia Careere).Movies don't get much more fun than this. The action sequences are thrilling (in a very fun sense) and the comedy is laugh-aloud funny. The film never takes itself too seriously, but it also doesn't become campy. If anything, finding this correct balance is "True Lies'" greatest success.No one is going to associate Arnold Schwartzenegger with the term "classical actor," but this is easily his most accomplished performance. Schwartzenegger has a lot more to do than to shoot down terrorist and make things go boom, and surprisingly, the muscleman is able to hit all the notes. Harry loves his wife, but sometimes his job gets in the way of him showing it (the film has a great one-liner about this, by the way). Likewise, Jamie Lee Curtis became forever known as The Scream Queen after duking it out with Michael Myers twice in late seventies and early eighties. Here, she's not only given a chance to show her comedic talents, but also her dramatic chops. Tom Arnold is great as the divorce-ridden sidekick, who despite his failures in marriage, is on hand to provide Harry with some support about how to show Helen some affection. Bill Paxton is suitably obnoxious as Simon; only a woman as desperate and frustrated as Helen could possibly take anything he says seriously, and that's why he succeeds.The villains equal the heroes, however. Art Malik is suitably psychotic as the lead terrorist, and uses his eyes to great effect. Tia Careere hasn't had much of a career before or since, and I have yet to figure out why. For one thing, she's gorgeous, and she's also talented. She's terrific as the seductive "other woman," and her dance sequence with Schwartzenegger in their first scene together is priceless (it's also somewhat erotic, although it's got nothing compared to the scene in "Titanic" where Leonardo DiCaprio draws Kate Winslet's nude portrait).Jerry Bruckheimer may be the uber-producer of summer action movies, but when it comes to film-making, James Cameron is king. This guy can do it all, and he knows just what to do with the material. He's open to taking chances, and he knows what the audience really wants. One of the best things about this movie is that it doesn't insult the average movie goers intelligence. To be sure, it's not Rhodes Scholar movie like "Michael Clayton," but it's not "88 Minutes," either.The film is rated R, and that's a injustice. The action is so over-the-top that it's impossible that anyone could take it seriously, and there's no gore to speak of. However, the reason why it was rated R is plainly obvious: Curtis's erotic striptease sequence. She does take her clothes off, and the scene is erotic, but it's also romantic (come on, people! Sade is playing in the background!). Unfortunately, any real sexual activity is a no-no for the MPAA, and thus the film was given an R rating. I've been watching this movie since I was six; trust me, if there's any example of how the MPAA is sex/nudity phobic, this is it.The "Terminator" films. "Aliens." "True Lies." "Titanic." "Avatar." If there's anyone doubt that James Cameron is king, that person has not seen very many movies.My rating: PG-13 for action/adventure violence, language, and some sexual content/nudity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently had a second chance to see this movie in a rare post-video theatre run - and cripes, did I remenisce. Although from 1994, True Lies could easily merge with any of the great '80s Ah-nuld flicks (Conan, Terminator I, Commando and what-have-you), and often topples them in key Ah-nuld movie departments - like the Ah-nuld staredown, or the Ah-nuld one-liner (must I really have to mention which one?). What True Lies does is cap off a thoroughly entertaining run of camp movies by Shwartzenegger, while causing us to remember the good ol' days when Arnie, the incredible cinder block that could also act, took on all comers. Now, having withstood gutterballs like Jingle All The Way, Batman &amp; Robin and End Of Days, and having survived heart surgery, as well as his 50th birthday - it seems that True Lies might be the latter bookend to Arnold's glory days. Now, only six years later, I doubt he could make this movie - somehow, it just wouldn't seem plausible. Perhaps it's up to the old bugger to prove me wrong.This movie rocked. And that one-liner?..."You're fired." Classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director James Cameron gets this action thriller off to a good start with a twenty-minute sequence of Arnold as a Mega-CIA agent insinuating himself into a party, blowing part of the place up, and shooting his way out, killing everybody who gets in his way. He is attacked by two Dobermans but boxes both their ears at the same time and disables them. (A brief shot shows us that they were unharmed. Never mind all the dead humans; dead dogs are depressing.) The sequence has no more to do with the plot than thirty seconds of ham-handed exposition would tell us.Most of the rest of the film plays as comedy. Arnold suspects his toothsome mate, Jamie Lee Curtis, of having an affair. He mobilizes all the resources of the company to spy on her, only to discover after much to do that she's been the object of the attentions of a car salesman who poses as a spook himself. Nothing untoward has happened. Curtis thought she was helping an American agent.The villains appear near the beginning, then disappear from the plot, then reappear at the end in order for more blood to be shed and more special effects deployed. It's always interesting in these mindless action movies to see who the heavies will be. It used to be Germans. Then it became Russians. There was a brief period full of South American drug cartels. Now it's Arabs (using Russian rockets). The climax is packed with thrills. Arnold is at the controls of a Harrier and people jump from the twentieth story of office buildings onto the wings of the hovering airplane. There is a race between the airplane and a truck and a bridge blows up and the truck may not stop in time and -- oh, well, what the hell.Arnold is his usual masterful self. Jamie Lee Curtis is enthralling. She's not only easy to look at but she's one of those actresses who doesn't take herself too seriously, rather like Burt Reynolds, and that's the kind of performer this movie requires. Tom Arnold is the sidekick. He's given all the good lines. ("Women -- can't live WITH 'em, can't kill 'em.") He's only just barely up to the part, accessible though it may be.It's a cartoon thriller. If Yosemite Sam or Daffy Duck should show up in a cameo you'd hardly notice it. But it is kind of amusing if you don't look for the slightest soupçon of sophistication.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasing blend of action, comedy and Jamie Lee Curtis - 82%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just how do you follow a film as ground-breaking and terrific as "Terminator 2: Judgement Day"? Well, if you're James Cameron then you come up with an action comedy staring the unlikely combination of The Governor and Jamie Lee Curtis. Before developing an unhealthy interest in sunken ships and drowning Leonardo DiCaprio, anyway. This may be Cameron's sole attempt at a blockbusting, mass appeal film that is quite overt in its aims. Like other all-action films such as "Desperado", "True Lies" doesn't do anything original or deep but a simple, well-paced story that can neatly be split into two different films (reflecting the turbulent past of the screenplay).The Austrian Oak plays suave secret agent extraordinaire Harry Tasker, a highly experienced spy and expert in counter-terrorism. In fact, Harry is such a good spy that not even his wife Helen (Curtis) or his daughter Dana (Eliza Dushku) know of his occupation. They both think Harry is a computer salesman. When Harry gets on the trail of Islamic extremists led by Salim Abu Aziz (Art Malik), it becomes even harder for Harry to separate his family life from his working life. Especially when he's distracted by the possibility that his wife may be having an affair, something Harry will use all the means at his disposal to investigate...Coming across as a strange mix of "Die Hard" and "Meet The Parents", "True Lies" is actually far more than the initial premise suggests. It is a highly entertaining picture providing you switch your brain off first. All the action movie clichés are there, from the stereotypical portrayal of spy work hidden in removal company vans to the baddie (Arab AND British, brilliant!) and the wonderfully unfunny pun Arnie reserves for suitably OTT death scenes. Yep, "True Lies" is about as original as a boy-band but when it concentrates on the job in hand, it does the job very well. The mix of genres is a little disorientating but once you get used to the idea, it works very well. True, the comedy is largely left to well-timed glances and brief flashes of slapstick (Curtis' slip during the infamous "striptease" sequence is one such example) but because the whole picture is such fun, you don't really notice.Both Curtis and Schwarzenegger are very good, the Governor displaying his comic instinct he'd shown us in stuff like "Twins". Cameron also knows how to deliver top-quality action sequences as well (he also gave us "Aliens", remember) and the climax on the Florida Keys bridge is one of the best out there, especially considering Curtis did the stunts herself. It might be derided as cinema for the lowest common denominator but let me tell you a true story. While watching the film tonight, my Scottish flatmate (whose favourite movies usually begin with the words "Based On A True Story") came in half way through and I was expecting to have to change the channel. Not so - she laughed at the right points, she winced as the baddies were dispatched and she gasped at the high-flying antics of Arnie and co. This is a much under-rated picture which isn't given anything like the respect it deserves. And let's face it, it's miles better than bloody "Titanic"...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps Cameron's least ambitious picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As seems to be typical of James Cameron films, True Lies set new records at the time as a top grossing film. Also like other Cameron films it's a special effects heavy action film. Although perhaps this is one of his least memorable. I have to confess to not being the director's biggest fan but I do admit that his films are at the very least competently made. This one is no different, but it doesn't have the ground-breaking CGI of T2, the unprecedented combination of state-of-the-art special effects with epic romantic narrative of Titanic or the in-your-face 3D of Avatar. It's a much more straight-forward action film, and one of the least ambitious films of Cameron's career. True Lies is as much an Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle as a James Cameron movie.The story that combines the action adventure lifestyle of its central spy with his domestic life is a typical Cameron move. His approach to action film-making has almost always incorporated strong female characters and/or romantic angles. This is unusual in the action genre. But it perhaps goes some way to explain the enormous success of his films ? they appeal to a much wider demographic than most films. While I am not particularly much of a fan of Cameron's work, I have to have some respect for this unusual approach. Whether or not it's a conscious decision based on making more money at the box office I simply cannot say but it does give his films uniqueness.As far as the thrills go, it's very much business as usual here but completely over-the-top. For action enthusiasts this will deliver the bacon I'm sure. For the likes of me it was efficiently entertaining enough, so I don't have too many complaints. Although it did seem to do that annoying action movie thing where it has about three false endings. One proper one would've been fine thank you very much. And of course there was also Jamie Lee Curtis' strip tease scene. An unusual scene for sure, while I do have to admit that her body was frankly outstanding, it did seem a little awkward and out-of-place. And this is coming from someone who appreciates gratuitous erotic moments in his films.A decent throwaway film overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'True Lies' is a totally ridiculous, extravagant, over-the-top Arnold Schwarzenegger action comedy that succeeds on every level. James Cameron, having directed 'Aliens' and two of the 'Terminator' movies, now proves that he can make us laugh just as well as getting our blood pumping.The plot doesn't really matter, but here goes: Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger) is a secret agent who specializes in blowing up bad guys with his wisecracking partner Gib (Tom Arnold). Since Harry is Arnold Schwarzenegger, he is good at his job. He's less successful when it comes to marriage: His wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) feels like she doesn't know him, and they have a rebellious teenage daughter Dana (Eliza Dushku). When Harry suspects Helen is having an affair with a sleazy used car salesman (Bill Paxton, hilarious), Harry dispenses his own brand of marriage counseling. Pretty soon, Harry and Helen are caught up in a terrorist plot and it's all uphill from there.What really impresses me about True Lies is it's script. There's a lot of cheeky one-liners and jokes; my particular favorites include Schwarzenegger playing dumb to a terrorist and then telling another terrorist how he's going to kill him while in handcuffs. Jamie Lee Curtis is very funny as always, and she even manages a scene where she impersonates a hooker well. Tom Arnold, who has been in a lot of poorly-received movies lately, is really funny as Arnold's sidekick and when he tries to counsel Harry in the matters of marriage and divorce, you get the feeling he knows what he's talking about. Tia Carrere turns up, still sexy, and her catfight with Curtis is a great moment. Heck, *everyone's* in this movie! Even Charlton Heston, who's still got that deep rumbling voice, shows up as Harry and Gib's boss (with an eyepatch to boot).If you're looking for a plausible thriller or an intelligent drama, look somewhere else. This is Schwarzenegger, after all. 'True Lies' is a triumph.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Arnold Schwarzenegger film that laughes at itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzenegger films are just of Arnie playing a hard man shooting bad guys but this film has a comedy touch to it.The film's over-the-top on purpose cause really it's spoofing the whole action genre. When Arnie started doing comedies like Twins, he started putting that into an action film (Kindergarden cop is debatable) and it comes out in this entertaining thriller.Arnold, not known for his acting skills, does a pretty funny performance in scenes where he's supposed to be funny. Jamie Lee Curtis does a great transformation into looking like a boring business woman to a sexy hooker but still keeps to the same character. Of course, there's the comic relief Tom Arnold as his wise and less-angry sidekick. Bill Paxton with a good role as a loser pretending to be a spy to get women. Eliza Dushku with a not very big part and Art Malik, the British actor who after this went on the Kumars and Holby city, as an angry terrorist.The action scenes are superb, espically the chase through the city including a motorbike and a horse. If you want Arnie-like action and comedy, go for this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"True Lies" works on two conditions: You aren't expecting "The Terminator," and you aren't expecting "James Bond." Instead, think of "James Bond" meets "Terminator," and you've probably got the picture.Harry (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a man going through turbulent times in his marriage, though he is not aware of this. He's too busy working with computer conferences. His wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) is bored with her husband, her house, her job, her life. She wants excitement. Danger. Mystery. Intrigue. And Harry's delivering none of this. So she strikes an affair with Bill Paxton, a secret agent for the government. But here's where the irony is: Paxton isn't a secret agent. On the other hand, what Jamie Lee Curtis was looking for she had all along: her husband, Harry, works for the FBI, CIA, or something in that vicinity. He's a spy, so to speak. His boring, dull, computer-expert persona is all a front for something more important. He and fellow spy Tom Arnold are the best of the best.The beginning of the film opens with Harry cutting through ice, floating to the top, making his way to the shore of a rich manor, shredding off his diving suit (revealing a tux, much like the underwater sequence in "Goldfinger" where Connery comes out with a tux), and entering the manor, which is host to a party right now. Harry then makes his way to an upstairs bedroom where he uploads info on who's been selling what on the black market.This does, of course, lead to some sort of plot with bad guys and explosions, but I didn't pay attention to that. (Well actually, I did, but to tell you the truth I can't remember a thing about the plot since I last saw the film.) The thing I do remember is that I was a bit disappointed, mainly because I had heard so many good things about this film. I mean, James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and James Bond spoofing material...what can go wrong? Well, nothing really went wrong, but the film slows down in too many areas and tries to start a side-plot with Curtis and Schwarzenegger's marriage life, which is fine (because you have to wonder what Bond's life would be like if he was--or had stayed--married), but the film seems to divert courses just to examine this in overly-long sequences. It dabbles a bit too long in the side-plot and doesn't focus enough on what it set out to do, which is half-spoof Bond, half-spoof the Schwarzenegger/Cameron team.Luckily this is all made up for with a terrific beginning and terrific ending. Schwarzenegger oozes with self-confidence in a not-too-ignorant kind of way, and, guess what, Tom Arnold is actually FUNNY in this movie. Yes, you read that right. Funny. Something he never seems to be, even when given the right material. In fact, Tom Arnold is so funny in this film, I found myself missing his sorry face when he wasn't on screen!Cameron has made better ("The Terminator"), and so has Schwarzenegger ("The Terminator"), but what he and Schwarzenegger set out to do comes through pretty good, even if the middle slowed down and diverted courses in the wrong direction a bit.4/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Am I the only person who doesn't like True Lies? No I guess judging by some of the reviews here. It's a relief frankly. Beucause it did seem, when this came out that everyone, absolutely everyone, loved this movie.I have nothing against action movies, I really don't. Nor do I have any complaints about the cast, direction etc. But the movie, which is known to be hilarious, I just did not find to be all that entertaining. True Lies was to jumbled and over the top for me to get into. I didn't think it was particularly funny or edge of your seat interesting. I didn't see it in the theatres, saw it on video and I must say my major thought watching it was, why did they make such a big fuss about Jamie Lee Curtise's strip scene? That said-Most of my friends, most people in general who I talk about movies with, are fans and that's fine, everyone has their own personal tastes but I just thought it was rather silly without much excitement to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Cameron's best work, but still an enjoyable action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"True Lies" is an action-comedy from James Cameron. It opened in theaters in 1994 and it was one of the last watchable movies of Schwarzenegger's career - before his stint into politics.The main plot is nothing spectacular (far from it): it takes a generic and stereotypical antagonist (in this case a Palestinian terrorist) and instills him with an infinite rage towards the USA. He becomes particularly dangerous when he manages to take control of nuclear weapons, making him Schwarzenegger's main target, as he seems to be the only person who can stop the terrorist and ultimately save the world. *Sigh*Thankfully, this plot gets sidetracked along the way and a more interesting one takes over. Schwarzenegger plays the role of a secret agent, but he isn't the sort of spy with a dark and troubled past nor is he a suave and carefree bachelor ? he's married. On the one hand, his spy life is unbeknown to his wife (Jamie Lee Curtis), who is convinced he is nothing more than a boring computer salesman and, even worse than that, a boring husband. On the other hand, Schwarzenegger is clueless to the unhappiness of his wife, whom he believes to be a fulfilled and satisfied woman - which of these lies is worse seems to be debatable.While most of the films in Schwarzenegger's career saw him as nothing more than a supremely built being and completely ignored the growing of his age (he was pushing 50 around the time of shooting), "True Lies" seems to be one of the few that recognized this fact and used it to its advantage. While the hero is still above most of his enemies, there is a human side to him and it's that side that draws us the most.I found myself entertained by the tension surrounding the struggling couple, as hijinks quickly ensue and they are both thrust into Schwarzenegger's spy world. Unfortunately, the couple's storyline seems to finish at the beginning of the third act. After which the film prolongs its welcome with 20 extra minutes of pure action to neatly tie a very thin and generic plot that nobody really cares about.Still, "True Lies" achieves what it sets out to do. It's a fun movie with a lot of action, explosions, special effects and elements of comedy underneath. While it is far from being Cameron's most inspired work it is still a rather enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it for the striptease if nothing else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching True Lies back to back with Mission Impossible 3, I realised that it was almost entirely the same premise - super spy keeps his life secret from his wife, and she inevitably becomes entangled when his worlds collide. Even though True Lies was first, I have to think MI3 - with a more appropriately cast Cruise - did the premise better. Although its pretty funny to go from Cruise sprinting to Arnie sprinting - its a very different style.That's not to say True Lies isn't a lot of fun - it is. There's a ton of banter between Schwarzenegger and Tom Arnold, some great action sequences (Schwarzenegger riding a horse through the city in hot pursuit of a terrorist) and some hilarious sequences as well. The best asset to the film is Jamie Lee Curtis, the uptight housewife who craves excitement in her life. When she verges on an affair with the lying wannabe womaniser (played memorably by an excellent Bill Paxton), Schwarzenegger creates a faux mission for her to feel like a big spy. The result is probably the best movie dance scene that I've seen outside Napoleon Dynamite. Curtis can MOVE man, she is seriously in control of whats happening - until she falls over, but she leaps right back into what she's doing (apparently this was unscripted, but wow I'm so happy James Cameron kept it in).The film skims over a few questions here and there, like how the terrorists knew where Schwarzenegger and Curtis were and to kidnap them. If the whole thing was set up by Schwarzenegger, shouldn't there have been Omega agents there? If Schwarzenegger can do pretty much whatever he wants, what is the purpose of Charlton Heston's character - in fact, where does he even go? He just vanished halfway through and Arnie seems to be running the show. The film's third act is a bit needless - Dana has been such a periphery character for the whole film, so to set aside a good 20 minutes to rescue her when we just go closure on his marriage seemed unnecessary. It just leads to a silly standoff sequence and a few cheesy one-liners - its fun but not very good. It also begs the question why Curtis was asked to join the agency - she didn't exactly do anything throughout the film. It just makes for a bit of a schmaltzy ending where everyone is happy.True Lies is a bit slow to start, but its a good Cameron-Schwarzenegger flick and has solid entertainment value. Watch it for Jamie Lee Curtis' striptease if nothing else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jamie Lee is True.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True Lies (1994): Dir: James Cameron / Cast: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Arnold, Bill Paxton, Tia Carrere: Pure nonsense and exhilaration regarding the hero being true to his family yet his profession as a secret agent is covered as a computer salesman. It opens with an action sequence that points to his private job then from there he secretly pursues his wife whom he suspects as cheating. This all concludes with a mushroom cloud explosion. Director James Cameron and star Arnold Schwarzenegger combine humour and action. Cameron previously featured Schwarzenegger in Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day as well as direct Aliens and The Abyss. Schwarzenegger brings certain humanity to his role particularly when he is faced with life outside of work. Jamie Lee Curtis as his klutzy wife is wonderful in her need for excitement yet being lured in by deceit. Tom Arnold plays his advice giving partner in what is a comical role. This would otherwise but nothing more than standard writing had Arnold's wit and comic vocal timing not paid off. Bill Paxton is hilarious as a lying car salesman who gets more than he bargained for in the film's funniest scenes. Tia Carrere plays a villainess who ends up in a nifty cat fight with Jamie Lee Curtis inside a limo. It goes beyond action by presenting a theme regarding secrets and the extent we may go to preserve them. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to my world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True Lies has Jamie Lee Curtis married to Arnold Schwarzenegger who is your typical American suburban husband with Austrian accent. By day he's a computer salesman who takes a lot of business trips leaving Curtis and their daughter Eliza Dushku to fend for themselves pretty much. But it's all a scam. Those trips are for Uncle Sam because Arnie's a government agent for some unnamed agency. If this film were post 9/11 it would clearly be National Security. But wherever he works Schwarzengger has Charlton Heston for a boss and that's one mighty stern boss.His last trip overseas may have uncovered a plot for some Isis like group to detonate some nuclear weapons smuggled out of Kazakhstan in the USA. While Arnie is out fighting Jihadists, Jamie Lee is sitting home and bored and gets herself involved with a used car salesman played by Bill Paxton who's got a pretty good line.Let's say that to keep the marriage together Arnie decides to let Jamie Lee and then their daughter into his world. It causes all kinds of complications and some cliffhanger situations one after another worthy of Indiana Jones.True Lies got an Oscar nomination for Best Visual Effects and it's presented to the audience in a tongue in cheek vein worthy of an Indiana Jones film. Some notice should be taken of Tom Arnold who plays Schwarzenegger's sidekick and he really gets into the proper spirit of things.Definitely for fans of California's former Governator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not the usual spy and counterspy one showing only federal special agents against terrorists with the also usual scenes of chase and counter chase and a lot of (very good ones) special effects and action galore. Its great originality is the introduction of some doses of good humour of good quality and the grafting in the original terrorist plot of a sentimental subplot about the marital relationship of the main character of a special agent (Schwarzenegger of course) and his wife mainly when he becomes convinced that she is betraying him with another man (which is not entirely false) due to the lack of attention he gives her. He uses his power and that of his Agency to disentangle that situation which makes that from a certain moment on the two plots become mixed up presenting us with a lot of complications, risks and dangers with the also usual unlikelihood of some of them in this kind of movies. We must also say that our man had always hidden from his own wife his condition of a special counter-terrorist agent. In short this is a movie we see with pleasure though it has not great ideas nor does it deal with deep themes. But its visual sequences are pleasant to follow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action and Comedy make a Terrific Marriage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True Lies sets itself above the most brain-dead of Schwarzenegger's movies by filling the void of being a Bond-rip off with genuine heart-warming silliness. Arnold is as off the top in this movie as can be but the film still maintains a kind of integrity which stops it from being unbearably cheesy. None the less, when you see Arnold pull an air-drier off a bathroom wall or riding a horse to the top of a sky scraper you can take pleasure in the knowledge that its okay to laugh.What the film does especially well is not ignore the sensibilities of a broader audience for the benefit of having a bigger body count. Unlike in the far less sympathetic Commando the action doesn't get repetitive. Additionally Arnold gets to play a multitude of characters, from comical to the suave Muscle-Bond. None the less, he is still Arnold when you look at him, but its nice to see him have variety.True Lies isn't an exceptional master-piece, but it is an action-filled comedic romp that will leave you with a smile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film cries out something like James Bond--full of action and mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was probably the best action-adventure movie Arnold had done. It was even better than his appearance in "Commando" and even "Raw Deal." The premise of the movie is clear, although it is not depicted until about the middle of the movie; Arnold and Jamie Lee, already married, deal with a renegade group of terrorists called the Crimson Jihad. This is a spin off from a real terrorist group called the Islamic Jihad. The Crimson Jihad's mission was to terrorize the world with nuclear bomb blasts that will kill millions, and kill millions more unless the group gets what it wants---respect.The whole movie has a "James Bond" style flair to it, and a little bit of "Enemy of the State" to it because there is a some spying going on in the movie.Well, at least, the high-pressure car-to-helicopter rescue over the Florida keys, with Arnold catching Jamie Lee's hands---just before the car Jamie was in crashed into a broken part of the bridge that was created when four Maverick missiles from two Harrier jets blasted that part of the bridge (which took out two trucks loaded with terrorists) ---was the most spectacular stunt in the movie. Even if that stunt was done by a double of Jamie Lee, it was still exciting.Before the trucks went into the waters, one renegade terrorist managed to fire a Stinger surface-to-air missile at one of the Harriers. The Harrier pilot knew what to do---make an evasive bank to avoid being hit.Then, the focus came on the upcoming detonation of one of the Crimson Jihad's nuclear bombs.Technically, when a nuclear bomb blows up in the air, there is fear of electromagnetic pulse damage. Well, the nuclear bomb that blew up did so on the ground (not in the air), but the one on the intercom that warned those helicopter pilots and military plane pilots to land a safe distance on the ground in the Keys before the bomb explodes was taking no chances, anyway.The aircraft that landed---which also included Jamie and Arnold---were, I guess, 11 miles away from the bomb when it blew up.And then, the final hostage situation which created the last climax of the movie was something. The character Dana steathily takes away the key held by the remaining terrorists--the key that would detonate another nuclear bomb in a city building. The main terrorist realizes it almost too late and chases her. But then, Arnold in the Harrier jet scares the terrorists off and eventually saves Dana. We then experience not just the Harrier's ability to hover in the air like a helicopter, but we see an example of the Harrier's firepower. I guess those 40-millimeter twin cannons from the Harrier firing about 35 rounds per second remind me of another movie "Blue Thunder", a movie about a police helicopter of the same name that has almost equal firepower.The movie does have its gentle moments too. I like the tango dances that appeared twice in the movie...especially when Arnold and Jamie were dancing. Even if some of the tango dance is not perfectly choreographed, it probably marked the resurgence of Argentine Tango around the 1990s in the USA.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a special secret agent, who's a top professional in his work. Harry works with two other agents Albert (Tom Arnold) and Faisil (Grant Heslov) but Harry isn't what he seems to be for his legal secretary wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) and their daughter Dana (Eliza Duskhu). Since they think, he's a boring Representative for the computer business. Harry is spying on a mysterious art dealer (Tia Carrere), who might be working with terrorist or not. But Harry finds himself in danger with a dangerous criminal terrorist Salim Abu Aziz (Art Malik). Which Harry seems to be very close of getting an answer of why the criminal is in the United States.But when Harry tries to make up for missing his birthday party for his wife by taking her to dinner. But to his shocked, he thinks that his wife might be cheating on him after overhearing an phone call. Which makes Harry extremely furious and he tries to find out, who's the identity of the man that his wife might be having an affair with. Now Harry goes over the line with the help of his partner Albert, not thinking about going after Salim and now focusing on his wife. His wife is a verge of having an affair with a fake spy (Bill Paxton), who's actually a sleazy car salesman. Harry learns a thing or two from this salesman, what could save his marriage. Which Harry gives his wife to a fake mission to give her more excitement in her life. But things changes when Harry and his wife are kidnapped by Salim's men. Salim is planning to use Nuclear Bombs on every major city until he gets what he wants. Now Helen learns his husband true identity. Now two of them will have to do anything to stop the terrorist, while trying to save their marriage.Written and Directed by Oscar-Winner:James Cameron (Aliens, Terminator 2:Judgment Day, The Abyss) made an entertaining Big Budget action/comedy with plenty of excitement and thrills. Cameron wrote the script, which it's based on a French film "La Totale!". Which it was originally written by Didier Kaminka, Simon Michael and Claude Zidi. Schwarzenegger and the cast certainly did have an great time making this in your face entertainment. Cameron created plenty of well designed action sequences and it was refreshing sense of humour. Although this film did receive some controversial, when it was release in the summer of 1994. The Arab bad guys in the film were portrayed in a unfair light and some critics felt the movie was extremely sexiest. But hey, it's just a movie. It was made and meant to be entertained only, nothing more. The picture, when it came out it was unexpectedly political to some degree.DVD has an fine non-anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD features only the original theatrical trailer. If you look closely in the trailer, there's some key scenes are not in the final cut. DVD Picture Quality has quite dated badly to some aspect, probably due of the non-anamorphic quality of the DVD. But the movie still sounds great. The film is well cast. Schwarzenegger and Curtis certainly make a great team. Even when the lead actor is with Arnold, which they have some great laughs as partners. Perphas some of the funnier moments of the movie is with Paxton, which he's a hoot in a few comedic scenes. Although it was certainly one of the last movies, where Paxton played these kind of pathetic characters well. Paxton went on to be a leading man in some great Hollywood movies and a strong filmmaker as well. This is certainly one of Schwarzenegger's best movies. Curtis appears in one of her best roles as well. This was certainly a blast of past to watch. When a time when Schwarzenegger was a big time international action star and Cameron was still making movies. It's been ten years that Cameron hasn't directed a major motion picture. He has a few movies in the works now, which it's about time. For now, enjoy this film before Cameron won Three Oscars for his work for "Titanic". Cameron's voice can be heard in a funny key sequence. Super 35. (****/*****).</fullReview>

The action scenes were unbelievable, and you will see what I'm talking about once you see it. Also, I think that I've never seen a movie before with terrorists that couldn't shoot! Every single shot they took missed them by an inch, I'm sure a 10 year old could shoot better with a little practice. I have to admit though that I thought it was extremely funny,I'm not sure in a good way, the bas script just made me laugh. overall i gave this movie a 6 because it was very enjoyable, but if you are expecting a masterpiece, this is not it!

		<fullReview>Cameron and Schwarzenegger team up for the last time, remaking the French action-comedy "La Totale!" by Claude Zidi. And even if the movie is less ambitious than The Terminator saga, it's still an example of action blockbuster done right.Harry Tasker (Arnold, in his best role ever) is a spy, working for a top-secret anti-terrorism cell called Omega Sector with his best friend Gib (the hilarious scene-stealer Tom Arnold). He's been married for 17 years to Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis, giving us an amazing performance as well) a quiet, unsuspecting woman aspiring to be more than just a lovable wife/mother. Things got complicated for Harry when a terrorist conspiracy, a red-hot femme fatale and a rival "spy" called Simon (the always great Bill Paxton) threaten the American Way of Life, and put his marriage in jeopardy...A true classic, the movie raised the bar for every subsequent actioner - that's the least we can expect from James Cameron. But the movie got heart too: great humor and lines from almost every cast member, incredible pace throughout, formidable chemistry between the two main characters... There are too many qualities this movie got and others action movies lack, too busy they are to show gunfights and car chases without care for good characters and plot.True Lies got both. It's not even a "guilty pleasure", it's a genuine good movie. The best form of entertainment Hollywood has to offer. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TRUE LIES is the kind of action film popular in the '90s--big on stunts, thrills, spies, one-liners--you name it. And why not? It was directed by James Cameron who gave the world TITANIC.This is a pretty ambitious action thriller on its own, never letting up steam all the way through--and featuring Arnold and Jamie Lee Curtis at their feistiest--and funniest. JAMIE LEE CURTIS is a "Suzy Housewife" kind of gal, a prim and proper legal secretary bored with her life and what she thinks is her mild-mannered hubby working for a computer company. She gets the surprise of her life when hubby ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER turns out to be a real-life Rambo, a government spy with a sarcastic sidekick (TOM ARNOLD) dispensing with the jokes.BILL PAXTON is a welcome addition to the cast as a sleazy used car dealer who pretends to be a spy when he's wooing the gals but is really a wimp in wolf's clothing. He gets his comeuppance not once, but twice, before the story is over.The last half-hour or so is the best portion of the film, right after Arnold has been exposed as a spy in the striptease scene where Curtis struts her stuff as an exotic dancer. The action stunts are beyond awesome and look as though both stars are doing every bit of their stunts--which, of course, they weren't. Artful photography and daring stunts take up most of the last portion of the film.Summing up: A blast--clever screenplay has lots of laughs and the thrills are practically non-stop. James Cameron really hit his stride with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun - lots of effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>99% of the time, we watch a film to accept the actors and their performances as we view them on-screen. That is, although we may know about their real lives -- for the two hours or so we are in the theater or viewing the tape or DVD, they ARE the characters of the picture, and we immerse ourselves the story, with little or no thought of the filming process. However, "True Lies" is one of the other 1%. While thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining, from the very outset, you cannot avoid thinking as much about the special effects, the utter impossibility of much of the goings-on, and all of the "over the top" occurrences - as much (or more than) you can concentrate on the story and plot, per se. It begins with Arnold's character, the master spy "Harry," swimming underwater in an ice-covered pool, in a wet suit, water at 32-degrees, cutting his way through an underwater iron security gate with a welding unit. He then bursts his way, with a saw, through the iced surface, with his waterproof tote bag. He removes the wet suit, and is next seen entering an Arab billionaire's Swiss mansion, in formal attire, his dinner jacket (from the tote bag) - clothing and grooming looking like he is ready to be photographed for "Geltleman's Quarterly" (after three hours' preparation guided by a team of professional dressers and makeup artists). We know that, in reality, that was probably the case in actual filming -- but that's the point: this is a film where you can't help thinking of these effects.As he proceeds to gain access to secret computer records revealing terrorist activities (after scaling an ice-encrusted balcony), when preparing to leave, security persons are starting to scurry about, and he needs to "blend"- he does so by asking the ravishing femme fatal (the gorgeous Tia Carrere, as "Juno") to "tango." She had cast hungry eyes upon him the moment he had first entered the room, en route upstairs, to ascend the fore-mentioned ice-encrusted balcony, to enter the desired room, where he transmitted top secret data from the terrorists' computer to his colleagues in their van, down the road.). Arnold then leads her through the dance, which is humorous, but sensual also, due to Ms. Carrere's presence. (Again, I couldn't help but juxtapose this with reality, remembering reading that Arnold worked for something like six months learning to execute these two or three minutes on-screen). When he exits these premises, the armed, uniformed security people outside are now alerted to a suspicious presence. So he first detonates by remote control a bomb (in the form of a Zippo lighter) he had placed on some explosive fuel drums, right after he had donned his jacket upon emerging from the water. He then - still in only his formal attire, hurries down a long, icy embankment, and even while skidding backwards (on his back!!!) for part of the way, manages to shoot about twenty uniformed security men, who are armed with more weaponry than an Israeli platoon. They are on skis or heavy-duty snowmobiles, with winter clothing, while Arnold is in only his fore-mentioned dress suit and patent leather shoes. He dispatches the last of his pursuers just before he enters the enters the van with his two partners, at their rendezvous point. This van, incidentally, has more electronic gear than a NASA control room. During the subsequent events of the film, Arnold, among other activities, rides a horse to the roof of a high-rise hotel (using the elevator while astride the steed) - and actually attempts to have the horse jump from the roof to a swimming pool across the street below. He rescues his wife, who is in an out-of-control limousine, whose driver is dead at the wheel, with the car nearing the end of a bombed causeway over deep water. This ONLY requires his leaning out of a helicopter flying above the auto, and extracting her through the sun roof by hand. And on, and on, and on. Wonderful hi-jinks, thoroughly outrageous, AND THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE AND ENTERTAINING. In addition to Arnold and Tia, outstanding performances by Tom Arnold (his sidekick), Jamie Lee Curtis (his wife, who for years has thought him a nerdy computer salesman, but soon learns better), Art Malik, (the consummate terrorist/bad guy), and Bill Paxton (hilarious as the doophus car salesman pretending to be an international super-spy). Enjoy this film, and even enjoy the knowledge that it probably required more use of the "green screen" background as needed for special effects, than possibly any production in the history of motion pictures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of James Cameron's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the Director of the First 2 Terminator films, Aliens, and Abyss. Brings you this one of a kind Action/Romance/Comedy.The main hero is Arnold aka the Terminator. Only this time he's not portraying a cyborg from the future.True Lies is about Harry Tasker, an under cover agent who works for a secret defense agency that involves preventing any national threats from terrorists. Harry's alter ego is a Salesman who lives in Washington D.C. with his family. His family doesn't know that he's a secret agent. Being a secret agent and saving the nation from national treat is quite job.But when a terrorist group is planning to nuke the nation with nuclear weapons hid in museum artifacts. It's up to Harry to stop this organization from nuking the U.S.True Lies is exciting and action pack to watch. Has plenty of good dialog and jokes. Since it's done by James Cameron, it has the similar look you find from Terminator and his other movies.It's worth seeing. I highly recommend it to the Arnold and Cameron Fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They just don't make them like this anymore. This was Arnold's finest action film and it is a whopper. Great cast and acting, magnificent action sequences (Bridge/Harrier) and a comedic approach rank this one up there with Die Hard, Rambo 2 and Raiders of the Lost Ark.The cast. Jamie Lee Curtis steals the show from the charismatic Arnold. As the housewife turned action hero, she was metamorphosed convincingly. That body has to be up there with the best on screen ever. The strip tease was both hilarious and sexy. No problem to know a talented director is behind the camera.Arnold is his usual dynamic self. He truly looks like someone who could save the world. The action sequences were some of the best in a movie, from horses and motorcycles in elevators, planes blowing up bridges and rescues from moving limos. The rest of the cast: Tom Arnold, Tia Carrere and especially Bill Paxton gave inspired acting. Just goes to show how much a supporting cast can add to a film.If you missed this one in the early nineties, rent it now for an old flashback to the great action flicks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure escapist fun from beginning to end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzenegger is Harry Tasker, super secret agent, whom leads a double life for the benefit of his family that he's trying to protect from what he really does. But when his wife (Curtis) starts seeing another man that she thinks has the job that Harry really leads in order to spice up her life, Harry has to juggle his family problems with his terrorist problems. This movie is just pure escapist fun through and through. James Cameron does a great job combining the comedy with the excellent action sequences and this is one of the few films over 2 hours that really don't feel tat long at all. My only one complaint would be that the role of Harry's wife, Helen MIGHT have been pulled off better by a different actress. No offense to Jamie, but she just didn't feel right in the part. This movie is STILL top grade A Schwarzenegger though. Plus it's the ONLY film that Tom Arnold shouldn't be embarrassed to have on his otherwise abysmal resume.My Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Arnie's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure about the rest of the world, but in Australia this movie is shown on TV at least every 3mths, and in prime time slots. I'm pretty sure soon it will replace the news."True Lies" is one of Arnie's best action movies. Some great action sequences (the chase on the horse, the opening sequence to list a few), a good support cast, most notably by Bill Paxton and Tom Arnold, who should have got more roles like this, and some great gags. The story follows Harry (Arnie), an international spy working on catching a terrorist group who has their hands on some nuclear equipment. Harry's wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) is unaware of his real job, thinking he works as a computer salesman. Their worlds are turned upside down when Harry discovers Helen is having an affair. Harry realizes he has been a neglectful husband and decides to surprise her by involving her in a pretend covert operation. This plan backfires and before too long Helen discovers the truth. A solid movie for what it is, even though the "affair" subplot was a bit lame. Let's hope Arnie gets back into movies soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite Schwarzenegger actioners. I was afraid this movie (along with the long line of Kid titles and inane comedies) would lead him down the path trodden so deeply by Eddie Murphy. Thankfully, that was not the case. He took another path to banality.That having been said, this is one witty, exciting flick which doesn't take itself too seriously. If it did, I missed it, at any rate, as this movie is just pure fun. The drama is not compelling, but interesting enough. The comedy is not in your face, but common and amusing. The action was entertaining if not exciting, but the cast turned in wonderful performances.Tom Arnold's best role to date is featured herein, as is Arnie's. Jamie Lee Curtis is ALWAYS a joy, and True Lies is no exception. If you haven't seen this one yet, I highly recommend a viewing.It rates a 7.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superspies, Superwomen, and retro-terrorists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One can't help but at least pause for a few seconds to consider the terrorists in this movie in light of the post-911 world we now live in. The movie now has an almost prescient quality to it, reflecting the greatest fear of the free world - not just airplanes being piloted into buildings, but terrorists getting their hands on the ultimate weapon and using it - the nuke. The movie was regarded completely differently in the pre-911 mindset: a tongue-in-cheek approach, a parody of the James Bond superspy adventure. Here we have super agent Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger) foiling the bad guys with his daring-do, in the middle of addressing his marital problems. Nowadays, we expect real-life versions of Tasker to detect &amp; avert similar real-life threats. If one can get by those few seconds of consternation and forget real life for a couple of hours, the viewer can settle back to enjoy some thrilling escapist fare.Though described as a parody, director Cameron doesn't let this slide into outright silliness. There's a convincing 'Omega branch' of the U.S.government designed to combat the worst threats, terrorist or otherwise, against the nation. The top agent is Tasker, who begins the film in a typical big-budget action sequence in another country, where he flawlessly employs his espionage skills, as well as mass killing of better-armed opponents (and knocking down Dobermans). But the picture really kicks into high gear when Tasker detects possible adultery on the part of his frumpy wife (Curtis), who thinks he's just a boring salesman. Both Cameron &amp; Schwarzenegger show they can be very adept at frothy comedy - in fact, this could be Schwarzenegger's best performance. He will never win acting awards, but the scenes of him doing a slow burn and stalking his wife's potential lover-on-the-side (Paxton - hilarious, as usual) are gems. Also a comical surprise is Tom Arnold as Tasker's partner; he's on the mark in almost every scene he's in - sometimes his inexperience shows, but generally he's a bright spot in the movie.Then, you have Curtis doing a startling transformation from typical housewife to sleek femme fatale. This basically happens in the middle of an inappropriate dance number but I'll never get used to that sudden change in her. Tia Carrere is also very fine as the other female, a rather nasty one, at that. It's a very good cast, no doubt, including a very young Dushku (future Tru in "Tru Calling"). But the name of the game in a Cameron film is action and we get some great set pieces in this one. It escalates (again typical of Cameron's films) until we have jet fighters blowing up well-known bridges and the aforementioned nuke going off as Tasker reacquaints himself with his wife. As I said, it's all done with a wink and a cheer, all the while gratifying us with impressive visuals. It's a bit surprising that a sequel never surfaced, though we seem to hear about a possible one every other year or so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True Lies is an excellent title for this film.It has all of the elements of any very entertaining movie. Adventure, romance, comedy, mild erotic scene with (Jamie Lee Curtis &amp; Arnold Schwarzenegger), a little violence, great action, mild language, drama and good special effects without going overboard as most films do these days. The direction was good,the plot was great and easy to follow, the cast did very well,(including Tom Arnold &amp; Bill Paxton),and the camera work was not like a lot of film and television with a lot of quick pans or fast close ups or fancy camera movements. It holds your attention and gives you a good laugh at times and you don't want it to end so soon, although you wonder how it will end. The ending was just what endings should be, but I won't tell you what it is! This is what going to the movies are all about, and should be. I recommend it highly and give it a big 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True Lies is definitely one of the best action movies ever. It does not take itself too seriously, Cameron´s screenplay is witty and genuinely funny and there are incredibly spectacular stunts and action sequences. In addition to this, this is arguably the most charismatic, funniest and all in all best ACTING performance by Arnie and a nice turn from Jamie Lee Curtis, too. Her striptease is hilarious and very sexy at the same time. The screenplay takes its time to provide the characters with the background necessary to understand their behavior, though admittedly, the sense of humor displayed by Cameron, especially in the middle part is a little edgy. To me, this is the movie James Bond would like to be in, but never was!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well what else would come from the master of action movies, James Cameron?Truth is True Lies is high octane thrilling fare with a passable enough plot and direction of the highest order.Arnie is Tasker, a spy who's kept his identity secret from his family for years by masquerading as a computer salesman. Regularly coming home late after dangerous missions, he has to fob his wife Helen off with regular apologies and fictitious tales of his day at work.However, after she becomes 'involved' with a charlatan pretending to be a spy, Tasker finds his work life getting dangerously close to his home life, and realises his marriage might be under threat.Add to this the fact a group of Arabian terrorists are threatening violence against the western world, a threat which Tasker's agency has to deal with, and you have an explosive movie with constant excitement.Cameron's direction is a true masterclass in never relenting with your grip on the audience. Every scene is packed with action, and almost constantly dynamic motion, be it from the angle or the content of the scene, ensures proceedings never come close to being dull.The acting is played at the right level of light-hearted, with great humour and campness injected to just the correct degree. Tom Arnold is unquestionably the best player here, with a character who steals every scene. Terrific movie and superb entertainment.</fullReview>

Arnie had already had one of his best with TOTAL RECALL and Cameron's moment of glory was still to come three years later with a story of two lovers and an unsinkable ship.That said, it is the action sequences in TRUE LIES that give the film it's power. The shootout in the gents toilet and pursuit to the top of a hotel building and the climax in the Florida Keys involving Harrier jets as they pursue the terrorists and try to rescue Tasker's wife are truly breathtaking and cement Cameron's talent and skill as the best action thriller director around at the moment.In spite of this, the film lacks some warmth at times, although some memorable moments of humour (thanks in part to Tom Arnold as Tasker's sidekick)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This would have to be my all-time favorite film. Few movies have even come to close to top it to my liking. It stars Arnie (who is one action star unlike most who can actually put on an excellent performance when it comes to various roles) as a government operative trying to hard to keeping his profession a secret from his wife(Jamie Lee Curtis). His secret agent sidekick(Tom Arnold) is the talented comedy relief. These characters and their situations create goofy and witty hilarity that is rarely well done in other movies, and that's what makes this one very entertaining besides the incredibly exciting action sequences. Most of the action is the high octane type, which I find to be a lot more satisfying then movies filled with just 'shoot-outs' or martial arts madness for action. I believe that the protests people made claiming that the film was prejudice to Arab and Muslim groups and the fact that the movie was prohibited in many Arab style nations was a little unreasonable. If this movie was given a chance in those foreign areas it probably would have been more successful. I was both blown away and laughing my socks off when I first saw this. The genre has never been more well written and the directing was not bad for James Cameron's style.</fullReview>

And whether or not he's a spy, he still loves his wife and his daughter. It's sweet. And I love all of those technology stuff. On a scale of 1-10, I'd rate it as a 13.

		<fullReview>I absolutely love "True Lies". It has lots of great action and Arnold Schwarzenegger actually does a pretty decent job in it. He plays Harry Tasker, a dangerous spy who tries to keep his profession a secret from his wife of 17 years (Jamie Lee Curtis). I loved all the action scenes, especially the one with Arnie flying the jet when he's trying to rescue his kidnapped daughter. I kinda didn't like her character of Dana. She was a brat and she got on my nerves. But I'm not saying that I wish she would've died. I'm just saying that we could've done without her character. I really liked Jamie Lee Curtis in this movie. She was funny and she sort of played a tough woman in this role. I liked her striptease scene. I wish I could dance like that! But it made me wonder how she couldn't have seen that it was her husband sitting there watching her. It wasn't that dark in the room. Anyways. I also loved the part where Harry and Tom Arnold were questioning her and she got mad and started slamming the stool against the mirror. And the part where Harry was holding on to her with one arm and she was dangling over the water was breathtaking. I'd be screaming too! I thought the funniest performance was that of Bill Paxton. He always plays the whimp who gets beat up or hurt or killed. He kept peeing himself every time he was confronted by Harry. Hilarious! I don't think this movie would've been that good if Bill wasn't in it. Well, all in all I enjoyed "True Lies" and it's a great action movie. This is one I would definitely like to own. But thanks for reading my review! Bye!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnolds last great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think after this film came out, everyone really started jumping on the F/X bandwagon and movies such as these were not as special as they once were. After this film, Arnold's career really went in to the crapper. But what a finale for a great career.In this film Arnold plays a spy who is leading a double life. His wife does not suspect a thing. There are spies who are bringing nuclear bombs into the country...somehow, and Arnold has to stop them. The film also stars Tom Arnold and he is actually very good as Arnold's partner. The film makes the mistake of getting off track for a while in the middle with a subplot about Arnold's wife cheating on him. That part could have used a severe edit.But the other parts are absolutely superb. I remember the scene at the beginning when Arnold is chased by two dogs. The way he gets away inspired cheers from the audience in the theater. Then of course there is the final sequence involving a highrise office building and a Harrier Jet. The idea for this whole sequence is very original and uses special effects instead of depending on them.The film is almost a parody of other Schwarzenegger films. But it still takes it's material seriously and comes very close to a fine line without crossing it. This is a film worth purchasing.</fullReview>

But what he hasn't told his wife being married in 17 years - is that he's a spy doing very, very dangerous missions saving the world from terrorists! Whoopsy Arnold! So when some world threathing lunatics starts planning to blow the world being lead by a beautiful woman, it soon gets very dramatic for the small time family...that meaning all started with the wife cheating on Arnold...surprise! It's going to get hot!!What doesn't Arnold do in this movie that really starts reminding about him; he makes his own flamethrower, he breaks guys necks, he flies a F-16, he dives into the water with flames churping after him, he sits on a horse in a elevator, he dances tango, he dreams about crushing a car sealer's face, he protends being locked up by handcuffs, he kills a man with a hand bar, he uses double Uzi and he flirts with his own wife - - okay, that was many very uninteressting things but though, Arnold is very weird."You're fired!" Good, but nothing out of the ordinery, see it! Nothing more</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[Contains Spoilers] Harry Tasker works for the "Omega Sector". This company wipes out terrorism, and they have a large issue on their hands. Some terrorists manage to get nuclear missiles, and they threaten American cities. Time for Arny to get mad!This film has great acting and good scattered comedy throughout. Recommended if you love action or just having a laugh.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pretty good and sometimes funny action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jamie Lee Curtis plays a legal secretary who believes her husband (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a salesman. In fact, Schwarzenegger's character fights terrorists who use nuclear weapons. Curtis keeps secrets of her own: she is apparently cheating on her husband. Later, she ends up involved in one of his spy adventures after he finds a way to get even. A highlight of the film: a wild ride through the Florida Keys. And there is an interesting variation on the usual car chases: Schwarzenegger, on a horse, chases a bad guy on a motorcycle into a hotel lobby (and the chase continues into the elevators). Schwarzenegger gives his usual performance, mostly tough but sometimes tender, but with a twist: he is also funny at times and remarkably polite, considering the nature of his character, to strangers. Curtis is also good but not as funny as in her comedies. Tom Arnold does surprisingly well in the film's one primarily comic role, as Schwarzenegger's partner. As is usual for a Schwarzenegger picture, plenty of violence and profanity make this less than appropriate for children. In addition, Curtis does a sultry dance in her underwear. I liked the funny scenes better than the violence but I enjoyed the Florida Keys adventure quite a bit. Lots of tense moments throughout to keep you on the edge of your seat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great for Arnie, not so great for Cameron</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'True Lies' starts off great. It includes the best James Bond sequence never filmed. After that we get a somewhat comedic plot to lighten up the mood from all the cliches and the stereotypes.Cameron has never worked with a great script and this is no exception. The dialogs are mostly bad and predictable. Of course the direction is superb and the entire movie is very well structured. The soundtrack is really horrible though, totally uninspired and boring.To sum up I would say that 'True Lies' is an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie more than it is a James Cameron one, if you get my meaning.</fullReview>

You need something to shake up things in your boring life. You need a secret agent as your lover. Your husband finds out. Your husband isn't the salesman you though. Your husband is a secret agent. Your new friend isn't a secret agent. He is a car salesman.

It gets to be a very nice action film, from the start almost to the end. I didn't like some of the stuff they did with the planes, like the sequence where Arnie's character daughter is hanging from the plane - typical action-hero-flick-scene that could have been avoided.I'll give a 6.5 (6 in imdb's voting) out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[May contain minor Spoilers]Yep it's cheesy, it's unrealistic, it's got muscle bound guys with big guns leaping about with all cylinders blazing...yep you've guessed it, it's another typical Hollywood action hero movie.Although I quite like True Lies, it still has it's fair share of tacky "one liner" taglines, and as usual Arnie looks about as convincing as a Giraffe wearing dark glasses while trying to get into a polar bears only golf club. Arnie should just stick to playing tough looking cyborgs...it requires less effort if you ask me.And yes, I know, stop complaining, it's supposed to be cheesy and unrealistic...after all it's a Hollywood movie but come on, it just got plain silly when Arnie and the bad guy were fighting on top of a Harrier jet, which was hovering hundreds if not thousands of feet above the ground...I can't even imagine it, it's THAT unrealistic. I could bore you all with the technical errors within the "harrier scenes" but I won't.I should really try and relax and just keep thinking to myself "it's only a movie" but there's a fine line between acceptable unrealistic movies and just down right stupid, unfortunately...True Lie's over steps the fine line....by about 1000 feet.Apart from the minor criticism, I have to admit, some of the action sequences do look pretty damn cool. The part with the horse in the elevator is golden.It's good; believe me...just try not to take it as seriously as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dance Jamie dance!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Move over Ginger Rogers, Jamie Lee Curtis is the greatest little dancer in screen history. She proves it in this film. The dance sequence is my favorite. Anyone with an eye for beauty should appreciate it. Its especially nice if you watch it in slow motion and freeze frame on your VCR. I don't think any of the other people who have written about True Lies has done an analysis of this fine scene. I would like to do one okay? Jamie poses as a hooker. She tears the lace off her black dress and wets down her hair. (Jamie Lee Curtis is a very beautiful woman and she looks even nicer with her hair wet). She walks into the dark room. We can tell by the expression on Jamie's face that she is rather scared. Arnold sits in the dark and poses as a stranger. He gruffly begins to give the orders. Jamie is very obiedient and does as she is told. I love the expression on her face! Very slowly she takes off her dress. She stands at attention in panties,bra and heels (very nice!! a feast for the eyes). She looks so dignified though. Jamie Lee is one of those special actresses who can do anything well and bring not only sweetness and talent but dignity and power to her roles. There is no other scene she has done that shows it more then this. She might as well be standing in front of the American flag representing all women! Then the dance begins!!!Jamie is a little awkward at first, but then Arnold tells her to dance SEXY!!!Does she ever. She really begins to bump and grind! THe music is really great. Jamie really gets into the dance. Its like shes on automatic pilot. I love her intense facial expressions. There is great closeups of her belly and legs and feet. Watch the way she wraps her body seductively around the bedpost and ridess it like a horse. Come on Jamie!!! She even does a comic pratfall. This is a great scene. I would have liked it if Arnold had forced Jamie to dance till she was exhausted! By the way, director James Cameron had originally wanted Jamie to do the dance naked. What do you think of that hmmmm?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To some people Arnold's career came to a flaming crash with "The Last Action Hero," which while not quite as bad as it's reputation is, was still a pretty lousy movie. However, to someone who had the aura of never making a mistake it was shattering. "True Lies" was a near return to form, bringing back all of Arnold's humor, action, and a few good one liners. However, the writing was already on the wall, for the humor supplants the seriousness of the action, and Arnold's good guy mystique starts to wear thin.Taken by itself "True Lies" is a decent movie with enough going on to keep the viewer's interest, and a pretty wild final action sequence. Sadly it seems as if this was the last gasp of a spectacular career.</fullReview>

I saw it for the 3rd time last night and really realised what a great action movie it is!Arnold Schwarzenegger is a secret agent who is trying to save the innocent basically by fighting some terrorists from trying to destroy and kill millions of people in an American city. And his wife, Helen(Jamie Lee Curtis) doesen't know that he's a secret agent.Sadly, the film would bring back memories of some inncidents in the past. But the movie has a bit of humour which adds to the choc-o-block action. Arnie some how never gets shot or seriously hurt(not that I wanted him to), so they could have made it more realistic, but other than that its superb.A well deserving 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this on TV last night. Oh deary me, what can I say? First Class Entertainment!! Arnie certainly knows how to make people laugh. As long as we can have a big laugh at this kind of movies, the world is still peaceful. Right wing politicians (are you reading, George W &amp; Colin P.?) should have a break and watch this film, I tell you (same goes to you, Tony - who increasingly sounds like a Tory MP these days...."Remember, member, member what a Labor Labor Labor you are...").This film was hilarious especially in earlier stage, until (SPOILER) Helen finds out the true identity of Harry. Then the plot becomes rather follow-the-drill sort of story line: i.e. the good guys get caught, then get a chance to fight back, then the baddies have plan-B, and the good guys have to overcome that as well, but finally with outstanding courage, skill, and moral quality (love, trust, etc) the good guys save the world.Having said all that, the visual aspect of this film makes it all worth paying for it. The last 10 to 15 minutes is very entertaining to watch. And yes, in order for you to fully enjoy the final 15 minutes, you need to watch all of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good action film with some bonus depth and intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title immediately introduces us to the pivotal theme of this film: paradox and deception. How can a lie be true? Deception and confounding is the name of the game and from the beginning we are given an array of misleading or paradoxical images. First a blade thrusts upward through ice on a lake, but instead of the elegant slim, Lady of the Lake dressed in white, we are greeted by beefy Arnold Schwarenegger in a jet black dry-suit, wearing night vision goggles ? quite a subversion of our expectations. Then a computer boots up with its Windows screen, but the text is all in Arabic, a cognitive disturbance set against such an otherwise familiarly contained background and frame.The theme is fleshed out as the protagonists' deceptions deepen by the minute: first we learn that, in his fake life Arnie is supposed to be a computer nerd ? he bores his wife with his made up stories to keep her suspicions at bay, but is so effective that she has lost all respect for him and is being lured into an affair. Then we learn that his daughter is subtly deceptive ? she thanks her father heartily for the snow-shaker he brings her (a present he didn't even buy) but then declares (out of his hearing) that it's lame, throwing it ungratefully in the bin before stealing money from her father's jacket.Bill Paxton is a used car-salesman who tries seducing Jamie Lee-Curtis by pretending to be a spy; so Arnie puts an end to his endeavour by pretending to hire his wife as a spy to lure her from Bill Paxton and give her some less adulterous diversion. This doesn't only deepen the theme but it also affords a great opportunity for dramatic irony and a painfully absurd exposé of the bored housewife's vain aspirations as she gives a cringeable, sexy, and ultimately forceful pole dance for Arnie.James Cameron's wonderful eye for action provides other eye-pleasing displays, notably the motorcycle versus horse chase in which the contrast between the sensible beast and the dumb machine captivates us. Interestingly, our stereotypical terrorist bad-guy is actually proven to be rather brave; leaping a massive distance on his bike from one building to another, and later jumping onto Arnie's plane. The Harrier Jump-Jet sequence is excellent and original action material, leads up to a (somewhat hammy) classic action/comedy finale.Our epilogue neatly brings us right back to where we started ? at a ball in a wonderful ballroom in Europe, this time however things are as they should be ? Arnie's passion is channelled into his wife, restoring our faith in their love and marriage. Carried through by sterling performances from Arnie and Jamie, this is a very entertaining action film that deserves to be watched a few times at least. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only thing missing from the opening sequence of this movie is the well-known Monty Norman theme. This is James Bond done better than James Bond. No one will claim Arnie is a good actor, yet it never ceases to amaze me how loved he is in the UK - they adore him. Arnie brought this movie to the Olympic village at around the same time the creators of Goldeneye got a look at it and promptly ripped up their entire screenplay and started from scratch - Arnie had set the tone. The ending is not what I would have - too much of the usual, too little elegance, and 'special effects' that are so unbelievable as to detract from the movie and the overall experience. But all through there are surprises, and pleasant surprises to boot. Don't underestimate the very talented Tia, and never underestimate Tom Arnold - what would this movie be without his contribution?This film also caused quite a bit of furore because of its supposed anti-Arabic leanings, which is ironic as Art Malik was once known as the actor responsible for bringing a better understanding to racial issues in England through his work in Jewel in the Crown. But all films have bad guys, and the Russians don't seem to be complaining much about the Bond series - they love it - so maybe it's just a question of groups which feel they're protected by PC getting typically a bit too hot under the collar. Malik does an impressive job, and this film should be seen for what it is - a modern Bond thriller. As such it is done very well indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a GREAT film, but great FUN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the midst of all the raves here, I feel the need to be slightly more critical, but just a bit! Cameron is capable of really wonderful, thought-provoking films- as in The Terminator and The Abyss. But he is also capable of producing over-the-top, hit-you-over-the-head blockbusters like Titanic. For me, this is somewhere in the middle- not thought provoking, but also not assuming the audience is made up of complete idiots. But sometimes, well, a lot of the time, you want a movie that is good old silly fun, and this movie certainly is just that.As usual, Cameron also gives us a strong leading lady, one of the main reasons I (almost) always enjoy his movies. Curtis is fabulous here- funny, beautiful, and a bad-ass (eventually). She proves her versatility once again, as an actress and as a woman, she seems able to do it all-even stunts! The tongue-in-cheek humor which references every spy/action cliche is a riot. This is pure fantasy humor for spy/action movie fans. And I love it. Post-9-11, the terrorist stuff has a different tone. Yes, I can see why there were protests, and it does perpetuate a stereotype. Watching it now, I just wish those references weren't in there. It just breaks the fantasy/fun aspect of the movie. As long as you know what you're in for, get ready to shut off your brain and go for a thrill ride with this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arnold (Schwarzenegger) and Arnold (Tom) are a great team in this movie. Plenty of action and lots of laughs mixed in with some good old fashioned spying makes for a very entertaining movie.Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger) is a computer salesman by day and a spy by night. Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis), is his wife who is in the dark about the real Harry Tasker. She believes him to be as boring and non-descript as her and is unhappy with lack of excitement in her life and their marriage.The movie moves along at a good pace and continues to keep your interest throughout. Tom Arnold really delivers in this movie and threatens to steal the scene from Arnold on several occasions. Bill Paxton as the slime ball used car salesman does a good job with a cliche role and makes for several very funny moments in the film.All is not great with this flick however. Jamie Lee Curtis comes up weak against an otherwise very good cast. The strip-tease scene is the only memorable moment for her in this movie in an otherwise mostly average to below average appearance. She however is not alone in this regard. Tia Carrere, while being nice to look at, fails to add anything to this movie.All and all a fantastic flick. If you like Arnold movies, action flicks, or James Bond type movies this one is for you. It delivers on action and has several very funny scenes. Well worth watching and adding to your DVD collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-fi action thinker guy says: a must-see action/comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"True Lies" is definitely an action/comedy rather than a comedy/action, but it is a safe file for a couple with differing tastes.The film is a parody on "James Bond" flicks, well-supported by Tom Arnold. Unfortunately, I found Jamie Lee Curtis' performance uninspiring -- in order for somebody to get hurt and have it be funny, the character needs to be a little goofy and cartoony so the viewer knows it's OK. That doesn't always come through in her character. And Tia Carrere is definitely at her limit here, which is probably why we haven't seen her in anything recently.With that tiny negative comment out of the way, "True Lies" is quite funny and a tremendous action flick. Lots and lots of stuff blows up, just what a guy like me is looking for. The film isn't exactly intellectual (there's nothing arty about it), but it's well-plotted and avoids insulting the intelligence as in Schwartenegger's "Twins", or Jackie Chan's "Rumble in the Bronx".Probably the 2nd best Arnold Schwartenegger film of all time, the 1st of course being "Terminator 2".Who should see this film: -- action buffs and borderline action buffs: a must-see! and drag along your SO -- comedy fans, even if you've been disappointed by other Schwartenegger 'comedies'. This one's OK.I give "True Lies" a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great film, classic, amazing set pieces, these are some of the words you could use to describe this film. It features some superbly staged pyrotechnics including the scenes with the fighter plane, especially when it fire its machine guns and rips buildings to shreds or where they blow the crap out of a bridge, these scenes will leave you jaw dropped at the shear scale of destruction also leaving you with a "how did they do that?" feeling in your head. The films plot is standard James Bond Style, but the superb action and subtle comical moments make this a more enjoyable watch than any of the James Bond films in my opinion. Tom Arnold offers great superb and provides most ofthe laughs as does a show stopping cameo from Bill Paxton as a sleazy car salesman. The action scenes are large scale and plentiful and its obvious a lot of time and money went into the production. Arnie is at the top of his wise cracking, macho, game. He is not required to do much acting which is a sensible choice rom Cameron becuase as has been proven in Arns more recent films, he cannot play the everyman and characters with more depth do not suit him. But hey, we want the mono syllabic, hard asses who feel it necassary to make wise cracks over the bludgeoning of a poor bad guy, we love it. Family man with emotional problems and a lack of one liners do not appeal to most of Arnolds fans because he just cannot realistically do it above B-movie standard. Anyway also good in this film is Jamie Lee Curtis who plays the frumpy house wife. She is made to look about fifty and dresses like a sixty year old, despite being about 35 when the film was made. Then there is the infamous scene where she lets her hair down and that will send male pulses racing. The only minor quibbles would be that the sub-plot of Arnie spying on his wife takes up far too much film time and could have been used up with more action between Arnold and the bad guys, also Arnie is consistently doubled throughout the film in action parts and fight scenes but he does a great stunt where he jumps from an explosion into water. For me this gets a 10/10 despite showing its age with the more stylistic approach to action films these days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Tasker (well played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) is your typically boring computer salesman (really a secret agent for a VERY secret government agency). His work takes him to many far away exotic lands and thus the time spent with wife and daughter is minimal. Helen (his wife) seems to understand and maintains their home when he is away as well as holding down a job as a secretary in a busy office. When trouble in the form of a slick, fast-talking used car salesman who makes a pass at Helen happens along, Harry uses the electronic surveillance equipment and tactical skills he has been trained with to stop this casual romeo. What follows is an action-packed thrill ride through many exciting scenes leading to a FANTASTIC finish. Jamie Lee Curtis is GREAT in the role of Harry's wife. Tom Arnold gives an above average performance as Harry's co-worker in the intrigue business. Just get yourself a copy of it on DVD and LEAVE THE AREA IMMEDIATELY AND SEEK APPROPRIATE SHELTER if Ah-nold (or any other unqualified or crazy person) is attempting to fly a Harrier jet(or any other type of aircraft) over your position! Just add this movie to your collection next to his other fine action films. And get this guy some proper flight lessons quick! Or "ground" (no pun intended) him until you do! Or I will file a formal written complaint with the FAA!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best actions films ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the most under-rated movies ever. This is an action adventure film and as such should not be measured in the same way as drama movies.The action scenes are executed brilliantly and the casting is well chosen. Arnie and Tom Arnold are very funny together and they make the movie flow well.Apart from a stretch in the middle where it goes from action to comedy the action is pretty much non-stop and fast paced. Keep in mind that realism is not what the movie is going for, so the movie is intended to just be watched and enjoyed not analised as this will just detract from your own enjoyment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My take on True Lies reflects a different understanding of James Cameron's intentions than that of many previous reviewers. Belief must be suspended to enjoy this properly. It doesn't matter that Helen couldn't possibly have been in the dark for so long, or that Harry could have access to or do anything he wanted. It also isn't important that he is American or that the enemy is Arab. What is important is what Harry and Gib represent: everyman's action fantasy. This is two big, goofy kids on a loopy, totally unbelievable adventure in which they do everything right and the enemy makes just enough mistakes to be defeated. Harry/Gib represent the lucky kid in your neighborhood who had all the neat gadgets: train set, electric hockey, walkie-talkies, all the sports stuff, and his dad probably bought him a Corvette! Throw in some of the best male banter (Harry - straight man/Gib - punch line)in any movie in recent memory, and it adds up to an extended ride on a roller coaster (it felt a little dangerous, but you knew it would be okay in the end). My only problem with the movie is that Cameron gets carried away with his effects. The movie should have wound down after the nuke went off. If he wanted to show off the other toys (ie. the jet), they should have been worked in on the Keys. The result is a movie that was well-paced, cleanly delivered, for entertainment only (certainly not cerebral at all) and had a 20 minute sequel tacked on to the finish that diminished rather than strengthened the total package.STORY B (due to the extension mentioned above) //// ACTING A (the characters were perfect for this vehicle) //// EDITING-DIRECTING C (due to poor story management) //// SPECIAL EFFECTS A //// CINEMATOGRAPHY A //// MUSIC C (what music? Certainly not memorable) //// 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last Great Action Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Cameron managed to make a sixteen truck loads of money from doing Titanic. Titanic managed to hypnotize people to see it over and over and over again. So he walked away with 11 oscars and a billion bucks and never looked back. But Mr. Cameron, what about us? What about your loyal fans who loved watching the terminator try to kill and protect John Conner? What about the mysterious under water affair of The Abyss (and Piranha II: The Spawning)? Well, it appears that James is willing to retire and settle into the easy life of television, while us fans watch great James Cameron action films over and over again. Like this gem of a film, True Lies.I couldn't be bothered explaining the whole film. So Arnold Schwarzenegger is a top spy. Working a case which involves nuclear weapons and terrorists, we learn that his wife, Jamie Lee Curtis, doesn't know that he is a spy. After a while she get into an affair, he finds out, then ,yadda yadda yadda, (spoiler) he saves the world from terror and gets the love of wife back.I don't know how James Cameron does it, but he managed to make that little plot outline I just gave, be extremely interesting, fun, wild and fantastic entertainment. I think what it is that he does, is make a situation that sounds completely unbelievable, and makes it believable. I just contradicted what I said, but its the truth. Plus he also has GOOD humor in his films, when he uses it. Just look at the way Arnold and Tom Arnold bounce off each other. Pretty cool.Arnold is always cool as he can possibly be, which is pretty darn cool.I think it's Jamie Lee Curtis who stands out though. Her performance of a woman being put into an unbelievable situation is both funny and true, I guess.All in all, seeing as Mr. Cameron isn't planning on making anymore action films, I think I can safely say that this is the Last Great Action Film. Of course films like Saving Private Ryan could be considered an action film, but it doesn't have that interesting humor that a James Cameron film has. So thank you Mr. Cameron for this, your best film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than all the other Super Spy Movies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's proved undoubtedly . Nobody can beat the 'never-say-die' combination of James Cameron and of course non other than the former Mr.Universe , Conan the barbarian ,commando ,the running man: Arnold Schwarzenegger the greatest action hero of all(if not the greatest actor, but he is pretty good at humor.)The last two times they came together, their aim was to first to assassinate and then to protect a poor kid from Nowhere called John Connor in The Terminator (1984) and Terminator 2:Judgement Day(1991). This time, I should say, the aim is better: To find out and eliminate the network of Arabic/Islamic terrorists.This movie, I should say, is the best combination of comedy and action (LARGER THAN LIFE!!!) ever.In this movie ,this poor guy called Harry Tasker (or Reinquist? No Idea.)(looks terrific and charming in those tuxedos.) who like others, has some woes of himself in his life, namely:(1) His secretive job which no one can be told about (not even to family members.)(2) His down-trodden wife Helen (we are talking of Harry's woes, right?) (3) His mission: The Arabic/Islamic terrorists (as per told above)(4)His daughter going the wrong way.(5)His a-little-cowardly junior Gibson(5)And last but not the least a guy who thinks himself to be a machoman especially when it comes to women and this time in his traps is none other than the down-trodden wife of Harry, who wants for herself some adventure in her boring office life. So what happens at the End?(Watch this movie and find out yourselves.)HEY!!!But...wait!What is our Poor Guy Harry doing in the public Toilet room? In an elevator with a horse(a real big one!) and also with an elderly couple?At the top of a building terrace with the not-so-intelligent horse?And...Hey...Why is he hanging under a helicopter that too over a blown up goddamned-bridge?( Wasn't that thing called 'SEAT'-in-a-helicopter invented than in 1994?)And also what's this another unlucky guy called Salim Abu Aziz doing in the same public toilet room mentioned above?What's he doing in swimming pool that too along with a Motorbike for company? and what is this now...He's now hanging at the Goddamned end of a Espresso-machine,sorry...a water heater,sorry(again)...a MISSILE?!!!And if this troubles are not enough look... what's this Harry's(down-trodden/adventurous)wife doing in the machoman's car and not only that she's resting her head on(or is it IN-BETWEEN ? that would be much better.)his laps(or thighs)?Also why is she HANGING under the same helicopter over the Goddamned blownup bridge(must be that 'SEAT' problem again)?Also now what's she doing with this particular mysterious guy who looks like he loves to live in the dark?What is that bird ...it's a PELICAN but what's it doing on top of the well-balanced truck ?To find out answers to the above Intelligent questions please watch this movie.This movie in my opinion, is definitely BETTER than all those much-hyped spy movies which start at NOTHING, end at NOTHING and you learn NOTHING from them except for some exotic locations to talk about.But not 'TRUE LIES'.(Watch it and you will know why.)And now to talk of ACTION.It's GREAT!!!(But then it's a James Cameron's trademark:HUGE larger-than-life explosions and a high budget which is ALWAYS more than he has ever spent on his previous projects.)Terminator,The(1984) cost a fortune but Aliens(1986) cost more than it.Similar is the way with Abyss,The(1989) which was costlier than both and Terminator 2:Judgement Day(1991) [The All Time Classic] overtook all,in the expenditures section.And you definitely must be remembering Titanic which cost more than $200 million PLUS. So that's James Cameron for you. Also Arnie's(and who else?) at his BEST when he works with Cameron.My Favourite scenes: (1)When Salim Abu Aziz fires a mini-missile at the fuel-tank near which Harry is standing, Harry notices the danger in advance and takes off and flies in air diving in to the nearby sea water just in time to get away unscratched from the huge explosion. As a result of that the sea water surface gets covered with the spilled fuel burning on top of it(Fire in Water!!!)and Harry underneath it with withheld breathing and no free air to take in the goddamned lungs.(The Scene in which Arnie is Swimming below the Fire is the Best scene of all).(2)Harry's harrier plane misses the unguided missile fired by the terrorists just in time.(3)Harry's Gattling guns in an attempt to follow the terrorists helicopter fire in the sea water creating a design in it.(Watch out for the Corner of the building next to the sea which gets fired in turn.)(4)The four Missiles (no idea whether they were Infra-red(heat-seeking)/LASER followers.)which strike at the bridge especially the last one being more productive(or destructive?)whcih hits the bridge just below the Arabic Terrorists truck.(5)Harry's Gattling guns hitting the Glass Wall of the terrorists floor(The scene is GREAT and terrific and looks beautiful.Just like THE MATRIX scene.)And now to some serious business.Doesn't this movie remind you of something?(Remember the 9/11 attacks? the Afghanistan Problem? the Iraq problem? the Kashmir problem? the Palestinian problem? and there are more examples ... but enough for now.)and the award for it all goes to...(who else but those F**KING B**T**DS again.)This movie is NOT one of my personal 30 Favourite Movies of All Time(including Life is Beautiful, Unbreakable, The Matrix, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Dog Day Afternoon, The Sixth Sense and ...many more.)but is definitely one of my top 20 action movies of all time. You better watch out for TRUE LIES 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a 90's Bond and Peel?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True Lies is a joyride through Testosterone Valley driven by the outstanding performances of Arnold Schwartzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Arnold in particular along with the sultry nastiness of Tia Carrere and the comic "machismo" of Bill Paxton. This is a tale of a muscled James Bond and an Emma Peel wannabe. Being a sucker for anything with Jamie Lee in it, I was captivated by her again but what surprised me was the easy-going comedic stylings of Tom Arnold. The role of Albert Gibson couldn't be in more capable hands. So if you're looking for a highly entertaining 2+ hour escape, this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is non-stop fun. The action is awesome from start to end and is kept light with some nice humor. The always lovable Arnold Shwarzeneggar is great in his role as a secret agent Harry Tasker who is married to a buttoned-down wife who thinks he is a computer salesman. Shwarzeneggar makes the well choreographed action sequences that much more enjoyable. Tom Arnold plays his sidekick and is a riot. This weaker and less courageous agent is always trying to stop Harry from doing some rash behavior. Of course Harry always presses on no matter what the odds. A truly fun movie that anyone should consider watching.Rating: 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has it all. Rocking action sequences, comic one-liners, and above all, top knotch performances. Schwarzenegger reprises a role he has become excellent at- the one man army. He performs effectively both as Harry Tasker and Rhenquist, creating a perspective into both of his worlds. Jamie Lee Curtis is exceptional as the lonely housewife, and yet unleashes a spectacular new wild side when called into a staged mission. Art Malik surprised me with his skill and aptitude for acting. He has appeared in past movies like "The Living Daylights", the last Tim Dalton installment of the Bond series. Eliza Dushku returns as a smarmy, spoiled teen daughter who is such a rebel, is almost leads to her demise. She has been one of the rising stars I've been able to follow, and I must say she's had quite a repertoire. I have to say some of her fear was a little uneffective, but she still played her part notoriously well. Tom Arnold provides the most humor to the film, talking constantly about the downfalls of his life, and spitting out humorous one liners every so often. This movie was definitely a turn-around from the so called "bad" movies of his earlier career. Overall, I say this movie is my favorite of all the movies. I enjoy it to such an extent that I could watch it over and over and never get tired of it. There's such an atmosphere that James Cameron creates with it that makes me feel I'm seeing something new each and every time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TRUE LIES, in my opinion, is an EXCELLENT super-spy flick. It REALLY kept me on the edge of my seat and made me feel good and smile. Also, it gave me a few thrills. I thought that Harry (Arnold Schwarzenegger) looked good in the tuxedos he wore and that Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) looked beautiful in all the dressy clothing she wore -- Especially the one she wore when she got the mysterious call to go to the hotel. My favorite parts are when Salim Abu Aziz (Art Malik) is launched on the missile and when Helen punches Harry when he says, "Well, what can I say? I'm a spy." In conclusion, I HIGHLY recommend this EXCELLENT super-spy flick to all you Arnold Schwarzenegger or Jamie Lee Curtis fans who have not seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you can easily turn a blind eye to the outrageous racism of this film, then you might find it entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film was first promoted, it was billed as a James Bond parody with Arnold Schwarzenegger as the super-spy. The trailer has scenes of shoot-outs on ski slopes, Arnold in a tux and Tom Arnold being his amusing self. But this trailer was very misleading.There's nothing more to refer to this film as then a shameless psuedo-propiganda film that only has two real goals: Resurect Arnold Schwarzeneggers' ailing action hero carrier and make James Cameron even more rich, at the expense of one of the most offensive racial stereo-types.Arnold Schwarzenegger plays U.S govt. secret spy Harry Tasker. Yes Arnold, who is Austian, is representing America in this film. His current mission is to stop Crimson Geehad, English word for red with an Arabic word in the same title, from nuking America with a Russian nuclear warhead, bought from the Russian black market. So it seems now that renegade Arabs have the money to buy Russian nukes on the black market, I guess they saved up their coupons.The Arabic spy in America is played by Tia Carrere, yes a Hawaiian Rock Star/vocalist is playing an Arabic spy in America. The main villian Salim Abu Aziz is played by actor Art Malik, yes a native from Pakistan is the obligatory Arab villian. There is nothing left out of his Arabic terrorits persona. We see him slap a woman, scream American and Arabic vulgarities, verbalise his hate for America and all it's citizens, use innocent bystanders as human sheilds, demand his treatening speeches be put on camera, refuse to let Taskers' wife go when Harry agrees to cooperate, and not have the slightest sence of humor when Harry says something funny or witty. Aziz is represented as such an unredeemable Arabic terrorist that he could make Sadaam Hussain want to take sensitivity classes with Stewart Smalley.Let's not forget Aziz's forty theives. They are all unbathed, unshaven, ratty, gun-shooting ,screaming manics who are so shameless that they would destroy their own historical relics, just to smuggle in their nukes. It's never even made clear, what country the terrorists were from, if they were nationalist or counter-nationalists, what their immediate qualm was with the US government was, or what their demands were. All Cameron let the audience know about these particular terrorist were that they hated America and wanted to kill us all or die trying doing it. We don't even know how they were so well financed, reguardless that they looked like they couldn't even afford a shave, shower or a clean suit. This is "Old Testiment" style filming at it's very contradictive worst.Directer Jim Cameron, a native born Canadian making a film about an American Super-spy, trys to supply the most minisule remnant of compensation to this nightmarish stigma by having the character Faisil, played by "Fail Safe" actor Grant Heslov. Faisil is supposidly the U.S. govnments' intelligence officer on Arabic terrorists, culture , and everything else Harry and Albert (Tom Arnold) need to know. Faisil seems like one of the most unconvetional inside opperatives for this situation, because it seems like he knows more about American idiosyncicies then he does Arabic idiosycicies from his opening scenes. In one point of the film Albert says to Harry "Dont worry Harry. We got a guy on the inside". At this point, you think that one of the terrorist will supprise the audience and redeem himself. Instead it turns out to be Faisil pretending to be a camera man who is called to appeal to Aziz's akilles heal, during one of his obligatory death treats.Back to Arnold. This film can't seem to stroke his ego enough. We see Arnold, who got a cool 20 million for this movie, fire limitless rounds of amunition at the terrorists, fly a Harrior jet, commander an Air Force strike team, jump out of danger from a an explosion and go hand to hand without breaking a sweat, while having his shirt ripped in all the right places. When Arnold isnot out keeping the world safe from those scary Arabs, we see him at home, making light of his more importent domestic issues, like his detatched daugher stealing things from him and Albert when their back is turned like cash and cigarettes, just before she rides off with her over-aged boyfriends' motorcycle. Simultaneously, Harry does what he does best and bullies the man about to move in on his affectionately neglected wife, with everything in his Super-Spy access on the tax-payer dollar. When it is time to be romantic, Cameron and Schwarzenegger pull the ultimare department store crime, and shoplift the tango dance and music from "Scent of a Woman", even though Schwarzenegger (as romantic as isn't) doesn't even hold an unlit candle to Al Pachino from that signiture moment.The climax events of this movie include things like Aziz kiddnap Harrys' daughter, put a blade to Helen Tasker throat (played by Scream Queen/ VoiceStream Jamie Lee Curtis) while Arnold saves the day, saying oneliners like "Your Fired" and "Hi Pumpkin". The climax is also topped off with one of Camerons' more deep-seeded fears of nuclear annialation, when Harry and Helen have their on-screen kiss.Yes one could comment on the quality of film making in this film as far as action, stunts, special effects and comic relief, but as far as I'm concerned it would be the same as commenting on the quality of a decorative household centerpiece made in a sweat-shop by under-aged migrant workers. It's impossible to appreciate, knowing the at the expense of anothers' dignity and humanity.This is not the same thing as seeing a film like the "Hot Shots" movies, because those film are don't in the spirit of comedy a good jest. It can also be said that lot's of film tend to seem offensive to those that are too sensitive, but since there are so few positive representations of Arabic culture, it's shameful piece of work. What boggles me more is who a film such as "The Phantom Menace" can be accused of having a racial stereotype, because the space alian Watto seems to have an Arabic accent and his only crime is over pricing his junkand this film is totally ignored for it's extremely racist representations. I've never read a single article about an act of racism from the influence of "Phantom Menace" and yet remember see a lot of Muslim kids get pucked on after seeing this film.On a scale of 1 to 10, I'm giving this film my very first -10. I refuse to say anything positive about this film and refuse to see it's up coming sequel. I pity the next ethnic group that Cameron plans to mercelously slanderin the sequel is he doesn't go with Arabs againThere's only one thing that the self-proclaimed king of the world seems to get right with this undigestable collection of trype...the title, because it totally makes sense to me.Before you pick this movie up from the Socialogical Science Fiction section at the video store, alow me to suggest a much more suitable solution: The underrated, under-seen George Clooney Mark Walberg Ice Cube film "THREE KINGS"I'll say it three times so you wont forget: Three Kings Three Kings Three Kings</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Attention folks . This is NOT an action film . It is a COMEDY or more better a pure spoof of action films but unfortunately not as good as Last Action Hero . The 80 % of the action scenes are so inprobable youjust can 't take them seriously not in a million years . However thedirector managed to shoot these scenes very realistically (!!!) and justified the title True Lies . For example the ending scene with the plane being in air steady (!) over the building is marvellously made and you can never think that the background was a digital screen. Fortunately the funny one-liners by Tom Arnold and the dramatic story of the domestic problems of Harry (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) utterly save the film from sinking . Otherwise the laughable action scenes would trash the film like " Airport 79 ". This is surely Cameron 's most unusual job to date . I hope the sequel will be more serious . Anyway Arnie here gives a solid performance but Curtis steals the show . Tom Arnold is also good . There are 2 reasons to see this film despite its childish campiness. 1) The creepy interrogation scene between Helen and Harry through a glass wall 2) Bill Paxton 's hilarious cameo as the fake spy Simon . He is extremely thin , changed and very unrecognisable ! I had to see the movie twice to realise it was him ! " Arnie 's best action film " ????? I really don 't think so. Silly but enjoyable fun . 6 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After this was released Arnold released a stream of bad films. But I can't hold that against him. I hope he can save his career with the release of "True Lies 2" and "The Terminator 3". If handled properly, they could be great action films. This was a great action film. It had everything a good one needs. It had great action sequences, good looking woman, likable characters. This has to be one of the best blendings of action and comedy that I have ever seen. Personally, I liked the whole sub-plot of Helen and Simon. It brought more humor into the story. And without it, Harry's relationship with his wife would have fallen apart. And originally in the dance sequence Helen was going to be nude, it was her idea to keep her half-dressed and do more with the scene. Plus, I really like the song that they play. This is probably Arnold's best acting ever. He had a lot of help from Tom Arnold. I thought the two played very well off of each other. Jamie Lee Curtis was hilarious. It was very believable her transformation in the film. And Tia Carrere just looked hot. The action scenes were great, especially the one with the horse. And there was some solid acting in it. So I'm going to give it a 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All that money couldn't buy a script ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally rented True Lies and saw it the other night. In many ways, it's a wonderful movie, and in many ways, its a piece of sleaze. This is an expertly made piece of work that has flaws so big and so offensive that you can overlook them only if you have never thought beyond special effects.The good: James ("Titanic", "Terminator", "Aliens") once more shows a virtuoso flair for the spectacular set piece. While the fabulous copter scene at the end may attract attention and really raise the hair on the back of your neck, the horse - motorcycle chase near the middle actually has more imagination in working with expectations. And the very beginning is handled with a sureness of touch that shows a master's hand at work. In addition, this is the best acting I have seen Arnold do. He combines a sense of self-deprecating humor with his usual expertise at physical stunts, and has a great sense of timing in both.The bad: What the hell were they thinking in the Jamie Lee Curtis subplot? This is offensively written in every way.First of all the whole "secret identity" stuff... how unrealistic is that? Second of all, the pseudo-"affair" with the lame-oid Bill Paxton character Simon. Third, the way that she still doesn't have a clue even when they are captured and threatened with torture. And I haven't even come near the "prostitute-in-a-hotel" sequence, which is drawn out wayyyyy too long - and as if she couldn't recognize her husband in the dark! All in all, the whole "Arnold as family man" subplot is filmed as if it were about another species entirely. I could go on and on about this part of the movie; suffice it to say that it makes the entire middle of the movie unpalatable - an Oreo but with a Crisco filling.Finally, the ugly: It may have been fashionable and effective at some point in time to depict Arabs, Syrians or other mid-Easterners as uniformly stupid, dirty, unshaven, and lunatic terrorists. But I suspect that that window opened and shut pretty fast, and today, this just looks like a bigoted depiction of straw-man "Ay-rabs" hollarin' their guts out and firin' them auto-matick weapons.All in all, this is another example of how Cameron and the writers have no one around them to give them any sense of proportion. I so dread the coming of "True Lies 2"...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was, sadly, Arnie's last good film. It starts briliantly with a post-tango gunfight and becomes a very funny, exciting action/spy movie. There is plenty of action and layghs throughout and the ensemble supporting acting is great (namely Tom Arnold and Bill Paxton). Sure, it's over-the-top at times, but it's supposed to be a bit of a spoof. I think that the people who didn't really like this film just didn't get that fact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That is the best movie I have seen before. I have really enjoyed of it. I think it is the best Arnie's film. Better than T2, Commando, etc. Even Titanic by Cameron is quite worse. I do not mean the idea, I mean Arnie &amp; Curtis's play. Schwarzenegger plays in the very special way, as to me. Certainly he is a brave hero, nobody can win him, however he shows he can be a real family man. He CAN love, and he can accept that he had made wrong things. Domestic warrior, rude &amp; polite simultaneously. Despite a very usual weak plot, that's the very bright and interesting movie because of 1st heros' play.</fullReview>

If you have the chance, watch this on DVD, because it looks and sounds awesome! My house was shaking from the subwoofer. There is plenty of action and humor in this movie.

		<fullReview>This is without doubt one of the best action films ever made and is Arnies most entertaining. There is a strong cast with Tia Carrera and Jaimee lee Curtis there to keep us guys drooling and Tom Arnold offers some comic support. The movie goes along at a cracking pace and the action set pieces are superbly played. One of the few downers would have to be the needless sub-plot of Arnie spying on his wife which takes up a third of the film. Arnie is probably too old to produce another action of this standard mind you people must have thought the same at the start of the last decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a different kind of cameron</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ok, this movie is six years old, but i still remember the first time i saw it. when the causeway was blown up by the harriers' missiles, i remember vividly my exclamation which i will not reference here. my point that this is james cameron's most outstanding picture from a stylistic standpoint. he made a comedy. sure, he blew some stuff up real good (i still believe the action sequences have yet to be topped), but he made a gleefully funny movie for arnold, which i think comes in second only to his comedic turn in twins. cameron does cram it full of subplots and it does make me squirm for awhile during the second act, but i do enjoy a drawn-out action finale (which, if you think about it, he has done in every single one of his films), so it pays off in pure adrenaline and decibels (i watch this movie at just half-volume when i want to rearrange my living room furniture). in the final analysis, if you look at cameron's filmography, true lies stands as the odd one out. it bears all of his trademarks including long and loud, but tonally and in pure storytelling, it's just a little bit different. i would like to see a collector's edition dvd one day. come on, cameron, i know you got it in you. i still hear too well.</fullReview>

Tom Arnold brings hilarity as the cynical sidekick, but-oh, my goodness- Bill Paxton is off-the-wall hilarious. This movie is probably just as funny as it is action-packed; and there's a LOT of action! Even the villain is funny. The whole plot is cliched, yes, let's have another Iranian terrorist organization against the U.S......

		<shortDescription>A blast!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"True Lies" is an action film that is literally a blast. Directed by James Cameron at a reported budget of over $100 million, "True Lies" stars Arnold Schwarzenegger in his best film to date as Harry Tasker, a spy who passes himself off as a computer salesman to his family. Terrorists are creating havoc in the U.S., and its his duty, along with his partner Gib hilariously played by Tom Arnold, to stop them. The first part of the film has some great stunts and action sequences. Then in the mid portion of the film, things start to get complicated. He finds out (or thinks he's found out) that his wife Helen, played by Jamie Lee Curtis, is having an affair. This part of the movie turned off many viewers, but not me. It kept my attention. Then in the last part of "True Lies", that is were we get to see some incredible super-duper stunts, action scenes, and special effects. And that is why "True Lies" is a must-see for any fan of action movies. While watching the last part of the film you can see why this movie cost so much, and I think it was well worth it. But it also has great comedy and terrific performances by Schwarzenegger (who's great as usual), Arnold (who provides most of the laughs), and Curtis (who won a Golden Globe for her role here). "True Lies" is lots and lots of fun.**** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why This is My Favorite Arnold Schwartenegger Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the trivia section, it says that Arnold Schwarzenegger wanted to do this movie because of the character. In fact, this was the most well developed character that he ever played in his career. He gets to be comically dramatic, while still getting to do what he does best -- action! I always like to see him in comedies such as Junior (1994)and Twins (1988). Although he will always be remembered for the Terminator Trilogy, True Lies (1994) shows Arnold Schwarzenegger at his best. His delivery and facial expressions are priceless. The script is great with one liners ad infinitum. Jamie Lee Curtis and Arnold Schwarzenegger are a great on screen couple. I am sorry they did not get to make a sequel. And, Tom Arnold is the perfect foil -- his dry, wry witticisms are hilarious! If you have not seen this movie, check it out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't ask this film to be subtle. One more film against the jihad danger from Moslem Arabs with many greedy intermediaries in our beautiful western world. An atom bomb is worth a lot on the black market of military equipment. But the film is funny because Cameron makes it so. Schwarzenegger can come out of a frozen lake in a wetsuit but when he gets the wet suit off you can be sure his tuxedo and bow tie underneath are absolutely neatly pressed as well as if they were coming out of the Chinese laundry shop round the corner in Chinatown in San Francisco. There are so many incongruities, over-killings, a horse in a lift, a motorbike jumping from the roof of a skyscraper directly into the swimming pool on top of the next sky-scraper, etc. Luckily the horse is not insane that is forced to run after the motorbike: it refuses to jump and throws our dear Schwarzenegger over who manages to hold the reins and to make the horse back up and save his skin from a very deep fall. That's the only interest of that film. Extreme impossibility. But the last tango in Switzerland is a good mopping exercise with Swarzie's wife being dragged on the floor as if she were the mop mopping it. I just wonder what his vision of a bullfight would be: sweeping the arena with the dead bull? So enjoy the laugh and forget the narrow-minded political discourse that is just proved dumb by the extreme excess of the film, the plot, etc.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cameron and Schwarzenegger team up again for a riot of an action movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True Lies sees Arnold Schwarzenegger play Harry Tasker, to his wife Helen (Jaimie Lee Curtis) and daughter Dana (Eliza Dushku) he's a safe husband and father working as a computer salesman. Away from the family home he's a top spy for one of America's highest secret services. When Harry is prompted to believe that Helen is having an affair, it signals the start of a sequence of events that will out Harry and lead them both to a confrontation with a deadly terrorist.To hell with misogyny and stereotypical Arab terrorist (Art Malik so OTT he's off the chain man), Cameron's True Lies really isn't concerned for political correctness. His aim, aided by his on form cast, is to chase, caress and explode stuff whilst having a laugh at every turn. True Lies, if anyone was in doubt prior to its release, shows Cameron to be supremely gifted at action set pieces. No expense spared of course, but you still gotta utilise those Harrier Jets, helicopters and horse carrying elevators to great effect. And so it proves. Throw in a tremendously funny script that gives Tom Arnold &amp; Bill Paxton comedy gold roles to revel in; and what you get is a Worldwide box office profit of nearly $264 million.It knows its nonsense, but it's the good kind of nonsense that Hollywood has to offer. Ever re-watchable, True Lies is undeniably great fun. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kick ass. This is a sleek, stylized James Cameron blockbuster that combines action, husband-and-wife jealousy and comedy into one explosive package. Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis take the front lines, and although they are about the last people in the world I'd put together as a couple in a movie, they work really well here, with Schwarzenegger's wit and simple charm clashing with Curtis'...well, the way she somehow exudes sexiness while not actually being the sexiest woman in the business. It's just how she acts I guess, and it works. Everything about this movie is just cool and quirky as hell, from that scene where Curtis goes on her first "mission" in the hotel to Bill Paxton's antics. It all comes together for a really enjoyable film. The action is fast and fun, building up tension as the movie goes on, and the comedy is really brilliant too. Schwarzenegger has this deadpan, sarcastic style that I find myself smiling at all the time, even when his acting gets a bit weak, and yes, there is a scene where he rides a horse through a building and into an elevator. That about says it all. See this if you haven't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular at times, way off as well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director James Cameron, whose action films have established him as perhaps the king of that genre ("The Terminator", "T2" and "Aliens"), attempts two things in this movie, but doesn't really pull either off.Teaming with muscle-bound action supremo Arnold Schwarzenegger again, Cameron tries to outdo himself with some spectacular stunts and action sequences. Many of these are quite impressive and visually stunning, but he can hardly top the special effects extravaganza in "T2" or the heart pounding action in "Aliens". While the over the top happenings are not a complete failure by any means, his efforts at making "True Lies" a tongue-in-cheek comedy that sends itself up don't hit solid ground.Cameron's dig at overkill isn't really funny, and the high energy, unbelievable action is too much an exercise in excess. The script wastes a lot of time on a silly subplot involving Harry Tasker's (Arnie's) failing marriage to his frustrated and lonely wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis), who thinks he's a boring old computer salesman, and her affair with would-be spy "Simon" (an ineffective Bill Paxton). While the end result is Mrs. Tasker becoming involved in her husband's espionage activities, it weighs down the middle of the film terribly."True Lies" does borrow from a few other films too (notably "A View to a Kill" at the beginning of the movie), however the most disappointing aspect of this picture is that Arnie is another one of those James Bond/ Rambo style heroes who is able to avoid showers of machine gun bullets whilst picking off the enemy with a hand gun.Don't let it be said that at its rip roaring best "True Lies" is a bore. I assure you though, that while the audience may have sweaty palms during some scenes, they will find themselves scoffing at many of the very same episodes. Undoubtedly an entertainment for unquenchable thrill seekers, but not an adventure I would highly recommend.Sunday, October 16, 1994 - Hoyts Forest Hill Chase</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True Lies is the most amazing Action Film ever made in the history of the 20th century! Yah, dude! This movie is tight! With amazing performances by Arnie(our fav action dude) and Tom Arnold(the humor master who makes the movie funny! hey, so does Arnie). With cool scenes eg. the scene where Arnie is on his horse in the elevator with the old people and in the other elevator you can see the baddie raising a knife at a womans throat. Amazing! And don't we love the scene where Arnie has to save his daughter. And total chemistry in "the bridge is out!" scene. An amazing thriller with everything we all want. I would rate this 100 if I could. Didn't expect to see Charlton Heston with an eyepatch but it fit in with the movie. Jamie Lee does a good performance too! Fit in with violence and stuff. Arnie being an agent, and his wife thinking' he's a salesman. This is once in a lifetime stuff, dude. If you haven't seen this film, I strongly advise you to. If you have, I recommend the following titles: OO7 movies(eg Dr.No etc), Lethal Weapon(1,2,3,4), and Speed. Enjoy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good action comedy-thriller with excellent pyrotechnic special effects involving Harrier jump jets, nuclear bombs (arming and disarming), building site cranes and skyscrapers. Comic sub-plot (involving a car salesman supposedly having an affair with Arnie's wife). Very good sets, and location shooting around Florida and Miami. The usual build-up to two separate action climaxes, the first very spectacular climax was on the road ways around Florida Keys and the second even more spectacular action climax was set in Miami. This sequence involving skyscrapers reminded me of a similar sequence in 'Blue Thunder' (1982) ? although it built upon this.Not enough time was allowed to explore Jamie Lee Curtis's reaction to her discovery that her husband of 15 years was in fact a spy. The revelation occurred immediately after the bedroom scene ? but in the next second the bad guys were breaking in with explosive action and noise ? and the film moved on too fast!Two sequences involving the Harrier jump jet had poor optical effects where strobed outlines could be clearly seen ? briefly when the Harrier jump jet backed into the skyscrapers plate glass window and especially when the principal villain was dispatched strapped to a guided missile. These sequences spoilt otherwise flawless and convincing special effects.A sequence when Arnie escapes from his torturer is unnecessarily bloody and violent for this type of film ? other sequences had less realistic, stylised death and violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as Harry Tasker, a spy who accidentally brings his wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) into the spy games arena when Arab terrorists look to use a nuclear to blow up Washington D.C. Along the way the good guys kick the usual array of bad guy tail and prove that America is not to be messed with. True Lies is often times fighting an uphill struggle to be both action and comedy. While True Lies works as action, it goes without saying that the comedy is very hit and miss. There are a couple of chuckles that occasionally raise a smile but generally they fall flat. Indeed had True Lies been treated as a straight forward action flick and dropped the whole comedy act, True Lies could have been an easy 4 star rating. Also a lot of the comedy is ugly as Schwarzenegger puts Curtis and Paxton through a series of humiliation for no other reason that so we can see Jamie Lee Curtis give us a striptease. What really saves the day though is that the action is very well directed and demonstrates a satisfying punch in delivering what fans come to expect. Also the "You're Fired!" line is ultimately one of Arnold's best one liners to date.* * 1/2 out of 4-(Pretty good)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you and your girlfriend/boyfriend can't decide on a movie to watch because she wants a romantic comedy and you want an action film look no further, because it has both in vast quantities, but James Cameron's clever directing does it in such a way where the opposite sex will notice the thing they enjoy more than the thing you enjoy more.But this movie is one of my favourites more for it's memorable quotes such as "Boy, I remember the first time I was shot out of a cannon!" and so on... There was word of a sequel in the works but when Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California the idea evaporated. Oh well I have a feeling it's probably for the best, with Arnold's age creeping up on him and that sequels tend not to be as good as the original...but If James Cameron was at the helm he could definitely surpass the original (i.e. Aliens, Terminator 2)Anyways, this is a true underrated classic.

Unfortunately, ever since Titanic it seems James has been on a very long hiatus and Arnold hasn't had a director to help him be his best. In this one Arnold is at his best as a spy, whose wife doesn't know he is a spy. In fact, she is kind of bored of him for the most part, and she wants some excitement. Well she gets it, as Arnold suspects she is cheating on him with Bill Paxton's character. If this is not bad enough, terrorist are planning to detonate a nuclear device...suffice to say Arnold stays busy in this one. The cast is great and even Tom Arnold is rather good in this one. There are some parts that made me squirm though as I would be the type to want to get revenge and all, but the stuff he does to his wife gets a bit too sadistic. Other than that though, there is a good mixture of action and comedy. The opening scene is great, almost like if Arnold was 007 and there is a really great climax to this one as well involving a fighter plane. All in all a good movie to watch that is enjoyable for all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good action movie and well worth the time to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another Cameron/Schwarzenegger collaboration, this time with Bill Paxton and Tom Arnold thrown in for comic relief.I actually think this works better as a spy movie than any of the Bond films. Not because it's better as such, but just because you like the main character more (or rather, the actor playing him). Pierce Brosnan is a worthy Bond, but he just doesn't have the screen presence of Arnie (does anybody?)Once again, Cameron pulls out that little bit more with the action scenes, especially towards the end with the various harrier sequences, although the missile with it's human passenger did have me going hmmmm, a bit. But it was all tongue-in-cheek, and as such works very well.Of course, since 9/11 the scenes with the terrorists in a skyscraper, being attacked by a harrier, may be a little too close for comfort for some people.Jamie Lee Curtis is fantastic as Arnie's wife, little knowing what her husband does for a living. I do hope she steers clear of any more Halloween movies. They're getting as tiresome as the Friday the 13th saga. But her performance here is great.Likewise, Tom Arnold is great as Arnie's side-kick and Bill Paxton's car salesman/con man is hilarious.On the whole, a good action movie and well worth the time to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great blend of comedy/technothriller;Tom Arnold's best career move. 9/10.: SPOILERS! Warning: I give the insensitive teen quite a caning.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A pilot friend of mine has always insisted that "this is the best movie of all time"! He's a boy; so we'll just excuse him.True Lies (1994) is merely pretty damn good. It broke new cinematic ground, not only cementing Lightstorm Entertainment's position as James Cameron's powerhouse production company, but also because it instantly pushed the acceptable length of a flick to around 2.25hrs from 1hr 40mins previously. I trust Mr King of the World will deliver something much better for the coming sequel than the drivel MIIB was, after making us wait for even more years! (It's obvious to me now that it was 'the money' behind MIIB producers Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald that was to blame. No doubt the repercussions have already happened, probably in Vegas.)But back to True Lies. Frankly, the supporting character actors (Tom Arnold, Tia Carrere, Grant Heslov), the lead actress (Jamie Lee Curtis), and the Harrier jump-jets walk/hover away with this movie! Arnie is just the sixth fiddle, but frankly, he looks good as a straight man. That's the point. He even scores for sucking at piloting the Harrier in the last act!The daughter, Dana (Eliza Dushku) has been memorable to me for being the most loathsome person in this movie next to Aziz, the psycho (I've only ever despised the little "smartass" kid in I.J.-Temple of Doom MORE than her.). Dana is1) boorish (a. Callously throws away her father's present, b. reacts with alienated aggression to everyone except her dipstick biker boyfriend, FOR WHOM she is stealing-because she's otherwise much too young for him), 2) talentless (she never does anything), 3) stupid (a. lets the dog lick the cooking utensil; b. hangs out with said dipstick boyfriend; c. screams her head off in empty, clueless expletives at psycho terrorist), and 4) a habitual thief (has been stealing from family friends (Gib) as well as her parents, for ages).Even her supposedly "heroic" act of thieving the keys to the nuclear weapon strike me as more a result of pure habit than actual intent or heroism. She's a complete SH*T, OK?; who in fact emotionally resembles the terrorist a hellova lot MORE than her own family. Sorry. I like Ms Dushku very much in Bring It On (2000), but here, she makes me wish the Harrier had caught a timely gust of wind: "Woops, whatta shame". (I NEVER bought the cheesy happy scene with her parents playing boardgames with her.) Albert 'Gib' Gibson (Tom Arnold) is hilarious when he gets down to her level by teasing Dana about her helmet, even though it's a cheap shot: "Boy, I remember when I first got shot out of a cannon" (thanks, Gib, I wish I'd said that)! All his scenes are impish: when he foolishly hides behind a very thin pole as bullets fly at his fat belly yet he stays unharmed, he thanks God after he has checked his intact chest and genitals! So this role is easily the best of Tom Arnold's career. It was a shame to give him lead roles later because you can't do snide commentary as the lead: the lead's gotta be the straight man!This was always intended to be in equal doses a comedy/spy thriller, although the violence of all the nasty terrorists, when it comes, is chillingly awful, and in the light of 9/11, much too close to the bone. The awful Aziz (Art Malik, who if he doesn't watch out will be completely typecast) is particularly offensive and obnoxious as he beats a woman (Carrere) to feed his arrogance and psychosis. I doubt that the sequel could withstand a similar characterization. Audiences will desert True Lies2 in droves if it depicts stereotyped terrorists, because we just won't have the stomach to watch.or it might cause riots.However, the "Jihad cameraman" (Mike Akrawi) is hilariously credible as a person conflicted by his greater fear of his own comrades than any enemies. It's a very informed observation, actually. I'm sure that psychologically, that's what it must often be like, during times when you're not being buoyed either by macho rhetoric, or certain substances. I'm sure it's not a picnic being a terrorist, but equally sure that terrorism must naturally attract psychos like a windtunnel. So those who aren't psychos would be more afraid of the rabid psycho next to them every day, than some far-off enemy. Macho rhetoric is always a bully tactic covering up either incompetence, corruption, or psychosis (or all of the above). Anybody spouting rhetoric should on no account be ever allowedANYWHERE near money, guns, or red cordial! I like Tia Carrere very much as Juno Skinner. I love her padded bra (you can clearly see the white padding inside the left side of her black dress (twice!) as she tangos with "Harry Renquist". True, she pulls out her business card from there, but the whole bodice moves separately from her body as she dances, and her breasts are set too high, almost in her neck. Dead giveaways, boys: PADDING. But the fabulous necklace balances it almost perfectly). Oh I don't care, it's ALL smoke and mirrors; plus it's really cute to see her try SO hard to be such a tart! She tangos so well, in fact, that you can't imagine anybody could be better. But for my money, Harry's wife (Jamie Lee) is EVEN more sexy (only because Juno ends up being just a little too cartoonish).Bill Paxton is perfect as the sleazy used car salesman who is such "nothing! &lt;I'm&gt; naval lint!". For years I kept misunderstanding this line as "I'm nothing! I'm Naval Int(elligence)", hahahaha, a spy agency rivalry in-joke. Hmm, maybe I was right the first time...Well, I'm looking forward to seeing the True Lies family reunited in 2004 (but I won't be upset if Dana has disappeared with her biker, never to be seen again). 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Action Comedy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True Lies right away did things that let me down. Start with a James Bond kind of hero played by Schwarzenegger who can't be shot but can mow people down by the dozen. Right after this, we see that he has two side kicks for comic relief. This immediately tells us that none of the good guys will be killed which would spoil the comedy. So there is really no tension in the story, no danger. As for the comedy, you either laugh or you don't. There were a few funny moments but most of the jokes missed. For my taste give me the more serious Brosnan Bond or a straight comedy such as Hot Shots Part Deux.In spite of this, there are good moments. Jamie Lee Curtis is sympathetic and sexy. Schwarzenegger is ok (thanks to Cameron), as is Tom Arnold. Paxton is pretty good and his character could be the center of a better movie than True Lies. Tia Carrere shows what a bad actress she is and the rest of the evil guys are so so. Cameron does know how to do fantastic action/special effects scenes and True Lies has some good ones toward the end. They were great to watch. It was a bit under cut by the good old boy line, let me borrow your jet for a while. The nuclear explosion was ridiculous but these movies have to blow things up.There are pieces in True Lies that are likeable and entertaining. Enough of them to make the film barely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not James Cameron's finest moment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is quite an achievement that after traversing no less than 6 horror films in the golden age of the 80's, (amongst which some of the most exploitive films where women were concerned were made), it wasn't until this film that she was made to look like, well I hate to say it, a slut.After traversing 2 Halloween films, Prom Night, The Fog, Terror Train and Road Games as a strong character who felt no need to take her clothes off for spurious reasons, or at all actually, she frequently fought killers including the supernatural Michael Myers to a standstill in many of these films. She really is not made to look very good in this film in a long horribly misogynistic scene that serves no purpose to the storyline.Suddenly hearing something that makes him suspect that his wife might be having an affair, he then spends the next 45 minutes trying to catch her out. Just one point, what about THE BOMB? Hello, the stolen ATOMIC bombs that they're supposed to be finding? And those terrorists they're supposed to be apprehending ?? Instead Arnold's character spends a ridiculous amount of time and men and equipment trying to catch her out committing adultery.Eventually even the terrorists find this silly (or are a bit upset at being ignored for so long) and put a stop to things, getting the film back on track but it truly is a ridiculous (and far too long) sequence.Some other stuff like a gun being dropped down a set of stairs and somehow shooting a whole bunch of people doesn't wash either and mystifyingly Chartlon Heston disappears as quickly as he appears. Things pick up towards the finale but it's too little, too late.Just a note: One of my uncle's cousins, who was the Sri Lankan ambassador to France is married to another film director, who was on the same Cannes judging panel as Jamie Lee Curtis a few years ago and they're still good friends. What does this have to do with anything? Nothing really but I just thought I'd share that with you all. It doesn't improve my chances of meeting her or anything like that.</fullReview>

But don't take it too seriously, it makes no sense. It surprises me that James Cameron decided to make this flick. Fueled by the success of Terminator 2, Cameron and Schwarzenegger thought they could score even higher with this high-budget extravaganza. I think that True Lies is the worst Cameron's film, yet one of the most entertaining on the market. I give it 8/10. Fortunately, Jammie Cameron goes on and scores big with Titanic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bull in a butcher's shop--and funny, too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True Lies (1994)Famous, mainstream movies hardly need another review here so let me emphasize how this looks now that it's twenty years old. First, overall: it's well made with humor and international intrigue. Second: it's a man's movie?sexist in polite (prettified, Hollywood) ways so that the women do nothing and show a lot.And third, actually: it isn't as snappy and funny as it probably felt at the time. Example: a famous scene that evolves into a horse (ridden by Schwarzenegger) chasing a motorcycle (ridden by the bad guy) starts off as exciting and hilarious. And then it goes on. And on. Little twists?like having both take separate glass elevators?are great, at first, but each gag is extended too far. The finale to this scene, regarding the horse's good sense, is truly terrific, though, and shows that there is a playful parody beneath all the glitz.That's something not to forget in general?this is basically a James Bond send up, pure comedy. It even begins in a high class Euro-party scene with Schwarzenegger arriving (by unusual means) dressed sharply in a suit. Very 007. Of course, you have to go along with the level of acting of this leading man. His counterpart, playing his wife, is Jamie Lee Curtis, who is dowdy and marmish at first in a kind of playful and dumb stereotype. But when, through very male-dominant manipulation (it approaches rape, honestly) this character changes her persona, and her clothes (by literally ripping them off), and we have the reason Curtis was hired: her body. Oh, I know the warning, don't watch a Hollywood movie if you aren't prepared for this kind of thing. Well, still, it reaches epic levels of insult when Curtis can't do basically anything (including walk in heels). Example: she fires a machine gun and can't control it and she kills no one, but then the gun falls down the stairs and slowly, as it tumbles, it keeps firing and kills all the bad guys. Funny? Yes! But think how funny if it had been Arnold's gun that fell. And if the woman, Curtis or even the tough Asian bad- girl character, could at least shoot a good pistol. (What we get from them instead is a cat fight.)I'm not ignoring the sometimes clever plot, and I am trying to insist it's light and funny throughout, which was a relief. But if you've seen other movies in this realm before this one, like a good Bourne movie or one of the better Bond movies, you'll appreciate the difference and maybe get restless. And a little annoyed. Director James Cameron is near the bottom of my list of famed directors, but I stupidly expected more here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An under-appreciated masterclass in action &amp; comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Cameron was running so hot as a director between 1984 and 1994 that True Lies is probably the least discussed film that he released over the decade, even the ambitious yet flawed The Abyss gets more love.And True Lies is a masterclass in superior action comedy filmmaking.Frequent Cameron collaborator Arnold Schwarzenegger is Harry Tasker, a superspy secret agent, and expert operative versed in many languages ? so he can give you a death quip in your own tongue as he breaks you in half.His wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) thinks Harry is a computer salesman who is a little too excited about his mundane role, she is a legal secretary bored with hers, while teenage daughter Dana (a young Eliza Dushku) runs amok.Harry's partner is Albert Gibson (Tom Arnold) and the two share an easy chemistry, ribbing each other throughout the film but meshing well when required, which isn't too often in a film that doesn't even take the near death stuff too seriously.Harry and Albert discover what they think is a terrorist plot to be carried out by the Crimson Jihad from a middle Eastern country never specified. Their Boss (Charlton Heston in a cameo) tells them to get on it. The team realise that their "in" is Juno Skinner (Tia Carrerre) a beautiful but professional trader in ancient relics who they think is somehow involved. The operation is run with split second timing and great care, with huge resources at their disposal to be utilised to investigate the most minor detail and to cover their tracks.The investigation is halted momentarily however? for lunch. Harry visits Helen at her work and unexpectedly overhears what initially seems a fiendishly dangerous effort but turns out to be the work of a desperate used car salesman named Simon (Bill Paxton) just trying to get laid.Against all Albert's better judgment (the man married Roesanne Barr ? whoever accused him of better judgment?) Harry moves all resources onto teaching this slimy guy a lesson. The unexpected upshot of all this is that Harry finally realises that Helen is simply bored with her life and wants some excitement? so again on the government coin he organises a simple mission for Helen ? without letting her know who is behind it ? and in a very funny scene Helen loosens up her inner stripper and puts on a show for him, though she thinks it is for a CIA target.As things tend to do in the movies terrorists unexpectedly show up ? the very ones Harry and co are hunting down ? and abduct Harry and Helen. Within hours both of them are on an island off the US coast, with Helen blissfully unaware of Harry's true credentials she pleads with the bad guys to let him go, informing him that she is in fact the spy? but eventually Harry let's on and things speed up even more.True Lies is excellent, it is basically four or five action comedy setpieces leading up to a finale that is very bit of an hour or so, but it never drags or feels bored.In a film of many highlights it is hard to pick just one, I'll go for the horse and motorbike chase through hotel lobbies, elevators and rooftops, but in reality there are many classic sequences in this film.As Harry and Helen (well mainly Harry) team up to save millions from the terrorist attack the body count and property damage bill escalates rapidly, but even though True Lies is violent and bad guys die in various ways, it doesn't come off as that bad. The victims are usually faceless minions in any case and there are always many more coming to take their place, and the real bad guys die in deserved but often morbidly amusing ways.James Cameron obviously had fun making the film, Arnie showed a flair for comedy and Tom Arnold has never been funnier (if he was ever funny ? I can't recall another movie he has appeared in). In a film with a body count in three figures it might be hard to label it lighweight but I feel that this is, at the very least it was more light and commercial than anything Cameron had put out to that stage? Then came Titanic and Avatar #s 1 and 2 in the all time box office stakes.After T2 when John Connor swore the Terminator (THE TERMINATOR! It's in the title!) off killing I feel Cameron too readily embraced the concept, at least with realistic depictions of violent action, and while I'd rather he went back to making Terminator 2s and Aliens's I'd be almost as happy if he busted out a True Lies every year or two for the next decade ? even if it cost us another look at 9 foot tall blue hippies.Final Rating ? 9.5 / 10. It's not Aliens or T2, but it isn't too far below either, True Lies has almost as much action and it's funnier than both put together. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before he sold outto make a "love" story with crappy acting and writing, James Cameron had a respectable career as a ground breaking action director. Gone are those days, considering his failure to make a TV series and his "beat-into-the-ground" mentality for the Titanic has overtaken his once brilliant mind. Too bad, because this film truly lived up to its own hype. I mean, it even made Tom Arnold a highly touted star for a short while! Nonetheless, this film was actually much cooler than Terminator 2, and the pacing was much better than T2. Provided with a good backdrop of supporting players, Ahnold looked like a decent actor for one of the few times in his career. Oh how I long for the old days and the old James Cameron.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnie's Last Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continuing my plan to watch ever movie in Arnold Schwarzenegger's filmography in order, I come to his 3rd and last collaboration with James Cameron. 1994's True lies. Plot In A Paragraph: Harry Tasker (Arnie) leads a double life. At work he is a government agent with a license to kill, while at home he pretends to be a dull computer salesman. Whilst on the trail of stolen nuclear weapons that are in the hands of terrorists, Harry discovers his wife is seeing another man, because she needs some excitement in her life. From memory, this is the oaks last great movie. What a way to bow out. Arnie gives one of his better performances (except when he is laughing at the end, when they are playing thumb wars) however Tom Arnold totally steals the show. He gets the best laughs and is truly a joy to watch!! Art Malik is great as the bad guy, as is Tia Carrera and Jamie Lee Curtis looks great, and has fun with her dual roles. True Lies finished the year, the 3rd highest grossing movie of 1994, with a domestic gross of $146 million (only Lion King and Forrest Gump grossed more) to become The Oaks second highest domestic earner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cameron and Arnie at their most fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In effect, True Lies features every aspect you should expect from a Schwarzenegger film. The manic action sequences, extravagant special effects and strong doses of humour throughout. Where the film differs is in its audacity and creativity when pulling off the more overblown set-pieces and by being helmed by a director who is a master of action in the form of James Cameron. This is clearly Cameron's most relaxed and purely entertainment based film, something that makes it greatly accessible but lacking in the punch of his better works.It follows Harry Tasker, a top U.S spy who has successfully fooled his wife Helen into thinking that he is a computer salesman. Why she isn't suspicious of all the times he comes home late we'll never know. For the first and final thirds of the film Harry and his team are tracking an antiques dealer who has links to a terrorist group who they believe are sneaking weapons into the country. It's pretty much as basic a spy plot as you can get but it's perfectly serviceable for a film like this. Schwarzenegger is enjoyable here. He'd played these type of roles so much by this point that he slips into it with ease. It's also the closest we'll coming to seeing Arnie playing James Bond so that's something else I suppose. Tom Arnold also deserves credit as Arnie's partner Gib, providing a lot wisecracks and sarcasm that make him a fun foil.The films entire second act is what really sets the story apart. Harry believes his wife is having an affair with slimy car salesman Simon (brilliantly played by Bill Paxton) who is pretending to be a spy to add some excitement. Harry then cooks up the idea of having his wife complete an ''assignment''. This leads to a really strange sequence where Helen does a striptease and dances in front of him in a hotel suite. Firstly, how can she not tell it's him? Secondly, the entire scene is unpleasant when you take a step back. I understand Harry wanting to get some kind of revenge on his wife, but to degrade her like he does just feels wrong. Jamie Lee Curtis excels in these moments of physical comedy and the natural comedy that comes from her interactions with Paxton are very amusing, yet the eventual payoff ends up feeling forced and unnecessary to the plot. As you'd expect the action is wonderfully stylised and unrestrained in all the right areas. Take for instance the best action scene which involves Harry on a horse pursuing the head terrorist on a motorbike and the way in which the scene works is how it just keeps building. First they chase through a park, then a hotel lobby, then get elevators to the roof, where the terrorist escapes via free fall into a swimming pool and Arnie's horse refuses to follow in a funny payoff. There are no lengths the film won't got to in order to provide the most excitement it can. The climax is similar. At one point it features Arnie flying a jet with his daughter clinging onto the cockpit and the terrorist dangling from a missile. It's bordering on ridiculous. Yet one of the films strengths is that it knows these situations are far-fetched and it clearly has fun in seeing how far it can go.James Cameron's direction is as smooth as ever and there are not many directors who are as competent when it comes to action as he is. Cameron also wrote the screenplay which is fun and well-paced yet certainly lacking in something extra. Even though I enjoy the first the two-thirds of the film, the weird payoffs in all, the final act does feel a little contrived and the film loses a lot of steam as a result. The strength of the writing is definitely in the films humour. It mostly keeps its tone light and playful, leading to plenty of good one-liners and interaction, especially between Harry and his team. Elsewhere, Brad Fiedel provides a brilliant score, brimming with excitement and energy that fit the films tone perfectly. It's a nice move away from the more atmospheric work of his previous scores.True Lies doesn't quite hit the heights of much of either Cameron's or Schwarzenegger's other works, partly because of its simply trying to be fun entertainment and partly because of the limitations in its plotting. The plot itself is too simplistic for it to ever be that gripping and the tonal shifts do frequently feel unwarranted. Its approach is both an asset and a hindrance as a result. Yet, when it comes to big action, comedy and effects then you'll struggle to do better than here. When the film sticks to its strengths it is undeniable fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the Arnie movie you haven't watched, haven't heard of and should watch if you have any appreciation for 90's action flicks. They're often easy and fun to watch, well constructed, possibly have a bit of a worthwhile morality to it and contains lots of improbable, humorous moments. Well, this James Cameron forgotten flick does all of that, and does it very well. You'll forget it runs at over 2hrs20min because it never lets down and the plot continues to maintain a solid level, evolving and throwing new elements in smoothly as it goes. Of course Arnie is Arnie as ever, and Jamie Lee Curtis puts in a superb, surprisingly complex performance as her character is put through all sorts of awkward positions and situations. Good action scenes, and lots ! - genuinely good laughs, some good criticism about more identifiable issues (within couples, for instance), and a great climax at the end. Watch it, it's that enjoyable. Really a fun, worthwhile Cameron/Arnie flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After making a stunning breakthrough with The Terminator, further expanding the immensely captivating universe of a timeless classic with Aliens, beautifully exploring the deep secrets of the ocean with The Abyss and completely redefining action &amp; setting a higher benchmark for sequels in cinema with Terminator 2: Judgment Day, visionary filmmaker James Cameron brings his sweeping cinematic vision to an action comedy this time &amp; does a splendid job yet again.A loose remake of the 1991 French comedy, La Totale!, the story of True Lies follows Harry Tasker; a secret agent who performs covert operations for the US government but pretends to be a computer salesman to his family. When his latest trail reveals intel about a terrorist group in possession of stolen nuclear weapons plus another investigation into his own life indicates that his wife might be cheating on him, Harry finds himself torn between his work &amp; personal life.Written &amp; directed by James Cameron, True Lies is another quality addition to an impressive filmography that juggles the elements of action &amp; comedy pretty well, and is ridiculously fun from start to finish. This is Cameron's first attempt at comedy, yet he shows quite a level of comfort that one usually expects from a more experienced genre writer. The material brims with clever humour &amp; as far as action is concerned, it's one aspect Cameron knows better than anyone else anyway.The screenplay is filled with totally over-the-top moments that seem absurd yet is incredibly fun to watch. Some characters show surprise amount of depth while others are mere caricatures. Camera-work is at its best during the action sequences, Editing provides a brisk pace to the narrative, Visual effects are state-of-the-art stuff that makes its crazy action even crazier while Brad Fiedel once again delivers a score that's energetic, adventurous &amp; fitting at the same time.Coming to the performances, True Lies features a fantastic cast in Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Arnold, Bill Paxton, Tia Carrere, Art Malik, Charlton Heston &amp; others, but their work happens to be all over the place. Schwarzenegger once again chips in brilliantly under Cameron's supervision, Lee Curtis begins on a slow note but leaves her mark with a terrific performance, Paxton does good in his cameo, Arnold is hilarious, Malik hams all the way &amp; rest do a fine job.On an overall scale, True Lies is a nicely crafted, deftly narrated &amp; superbly executed piece of blockbuster filmmaking that blends the amazing with the absurd in an enthralling manner, is an outstanding template for anyone looking to make an action comedy, and is enjoyable, entertaining &amp; satisfying in sufficient doses even after all these years. A highly amusing, often silly yet thoroughly fun extravaganza from James Cameron that's worth your time &amp; money, True Lies comes delightfully recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnold Schwarzenegger In A Hilarious Parody Of A James Bond Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i like James Cameron as a director it shows here this film is a stunt fest specially near the climax but the whole movie is over the top i mean what were these guys thinking at that time bond was out of action in cinemas the last 007 film was license to kill 1989 of timothy Dalton there was a large gap and people thought bond is dead then came a lot of parodies and films that loved to ape bond.this movie true lies is a remake of a french film i have not seen that one but true lies is not a serious film at all if anyone is expecting it to be.there is no proper story or script for this i wonder why such a talented director like James Cameron decided to film this project off course it became a hit because the name Arnold was attached one of the reasons behind it was the terminator hype this came right after that both Cameron and Arnold worked together before on those films people though hey the dynamic duo is back they will give us one hell of a ride.there are few reasons why this film is like a parody and can not be considered a original spy flick for one i have to say true likes tries very hard to takes itself seriously and end up failing hard.let us look at the plot:a guy who is married and have a daughter lives a secret life as a government agent always sent on dangerous missions soon his lies gets exposed when his family and the country is at risk by the hands of terrorists.the plot sounded good it could have been a solid thriller of a film if only the comedy was not involved yes i am saying it comedy ruined this project the whole angle of his wife meeting a guy who cheats on women and wants to get laid with everyone women are attracted to him because he tells them that he is a super spy.plus not only this spy angle and comedy the editing was terrible here along with the score and music.the cast is good Anrold Schwarzenneger the iconic star himself looks good here but he should have made a bond film if he was so desperate just what was he doing here embarrassing himself,Jamie Lee Curtis role is awful she still did her best but one thing that got me hooked on this film is none other then Tia Carrere and i totally agree with people who say she reminds them of former bond girls Barbra Carrera &amp; Talisa Soto because i am actually the biggest fan of these women myself what can i say i am a hardcore 007 fan waiting for Spectre 2015 with Daniel Craig.its hard not to laugh when watching this because at many points the jokes and situations are funny but good thing is the ending i mean really bride exploding the jet fighter plane Arnold unleashes on the villains is really well done for that time 1994.true lies 94 is just a terrible film but that does not mean it lacks some great aspects director James Cameron showcases his greatness here the film looks slick and stylish despite the awful script.one year later after this film in 1995 James Bond resurrected with a big bang as Pierce Brosnan emerged as agent 007 James bond in the number 1 film in the world Goldeneye and boy did it end not only true lies reign at box office but created havoc and media frenzy world wide surpassing everything.i would not go too far and say Skipp this film why because it is a lot better then most of the nonsense what we have today.Overall True Lies 1994 is a nice watchable film if you like some good direction but it is also the worst of James Cameron his best are Titanic 1997 &amp; Avatar 2009 my rating is 3/10.Below Average</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Tasker is a spy, however to his wife Helen he is just a boring computer salesman. However things turn sour when his two lives collide and both he and Helen must fight off terrorists and not only save their marriage, but their lives.This film starred: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis &amp; Bill Paxton.True Lies is an overrated film in my opinion and quite poor for a James Cameron movie. I was really disappointing by this movie because I am a huge Cameron fan, a huge Schwarzenegger fan and also a Bill Paxton fan. I don't really recommend this film because I found it quite boring and quite poor.**/***** Poor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Action Comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzenegger plays secret agent Harry Trasker, who tries to keep his profession secret from his wife Helen(played by Jamie Lee Curtis). Harry doesn't realize how bored Helen has become, and is shocked when she contemplates having an affair with a sleazy used car dealer(played by Bill Paxton). Harry and his partner Albert(Tom Arnold) then concoct an elaborate plan to determine if Helen has cheated or not, but this plan is interrupted when Muslim terrorists plan to attack America with a nuclear warhead, so Helen instead ends up aiding Harry in this desperate mission to save the country.Good cast, and energetic direction by James Cameron compensate for rambling nature of the film, which spends too much time with its "Is Helen cheating" subplot. Still, the action scenes deliver the goods, and (now old-fashioned!) action/adventure film is quite entertaining(if not that credible) Charlton Heston has a good cameo role as Harry's tough boss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only give this movie 2 stars because it is NOT available in an anamorphic format. (It is NOT "enhanced for widescreen TV"). The video quality is very poor. This movie and "The Abyss" ( both James Cameron films) need to be released both on anamorphic DVD (for those who do not have Blu Ray) and on Blu Ray. It is my understanding that James Cameron must personally authorize a transfer to anamorphic DVD and a transfer to Blu Ray. I will not purchase either of these titles until they are available on Blu Ray. James Cameron needs to quit screwing around with his submarine and his other underwater adventures and get on the stick to get these two movies released in a proper format. He would probably make enough money off of the Blu Ray releases alone to finance more of his adventures!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cameron's descent into the dumb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I SHOULD love TRUE LIES. I mean, I love the track records of almost all those involved, and this was a hugely successful movie packed with explosive action. It's a film that mixes in ample comedy with the thrills and most people seem to love it. Yet it's a film that leaves me pretty cold, and no amount of sophisticated special effects shots can change that.Sadly, what we have here starts out as a promising Bond-style spy thriller that gradually descends to the level of a lame comedy, padded out with sleaze and pee jokes masquerading as family cinema. Man, I don't know what Cameron was thinking when he wrote the screenplay, but he clearly didn't employ the services of an editor to take out a lot of endless padding. TRUE LIES is an example of a director at his self-indulgent worst.Don't get me wrong, I love the spy stuff in this film. Arnie is at the top of his game, throwing plenty of workable humour into the mix, and the action scenes look highly impressive; the ending with the fighter jet is something that hadn't been done before (and hasn't been attempted since, for that matter). However, the fights do fail to be immersive, and there's always something dumb around the corner (like the machine gun falling down the steps) waiting to take you out of it.The worst thing, for me, is by far Jamie Lee Curtis's character. She's supposed to be this mousy, bored housewife who transforms into a feisty femme fatale, but I didn't buy it for a second. The main plot is forgotten for a whole hour or so while the movie takes a detour into laboured comedy as Arnie investigates his wife's private life, and this part is excruciating in the extreme; even a funny turn from the reliable Bill Paxton can't change that.I was puzzled when I heard that Curtis won a Golden Globe for her performance in this film. It's the worst I've seen from her, and a surprise given that she was so good expressing fear in the early slasher movies of her career. Her acting here is embarrassingly bad, and it's no surprise she disappeared from our screens afterwards (aside from appearing in some best forgotten HALLOWEEN sequels). The film's nadir is the ultra-humiliating striptease sequence which is sleazy beyond believe, and Cameron's attempts to lighten the mood with some slapstick comedy just fail. God, what was he thinking? I watch B-movies on a regular basis and even the sleaziest fail to objectify women in this way.There's lots of other bad stuff too, including the most racist depiction of Arabic characters that I've seen in a Hollywood movie (Art Malik should be ashamed). Cameron was planning a TRUE LIES 2 before 9/11 and went on record to say that the sequel was cancelled because 'terrorists weren't just funny anymore'. I've got news for you Cameron, they were never funny, and that becomes clear watching this.Cast-wise, Tom Arnold clearly relishes the comedy sidekick type role, but it's so one-note that it becomes tiresome around the halfway mark. And watch out for an excruciatingly bad turn from Tia Carrere, who gives a performance that's even worse than Curtis's! Incredible, but true. My favourite part of the film? The gag with the rocket launcher, in which Cameron makes up for a mistake earlier in his career; when scripting RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II, he had Stallone firing a rocket launcher from a helicopter, leaving the guys behind him unscathed. He corrects that here, and it's the funniest thing in the otherwise disappointing movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Uncomfortable Mix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a shame. All the Action and fun stuff is here trying and mostly succeeding in topping that what had gone before, but the sub-plot, actually another plot, of the frustrated Wife is mishandled. The rather raunchy, sleazy humor seems out of place here and at times Viewers may feel embarrassed, at the very least for the Performers.Some of the dirty lines and situations belong in another Movie and mix uneasily. What works best is the blistering Action Scenes. The attempted humor, excluding some cringe-inducing filthy sexual innuendos, can fit into this. Arnie's sidekick mostly supplies the punch lines and His Wife supplies most of the punches.So this is a mixed bag of enjoyment. If you can ignore the middle section with some really clunky stuff, and tolerate Bill Paxton's obnoxious, over the top Character, this can be Thrilling. in all, the Good outweighs the Bad. The Good is really Good, but the Bad is really Bad. The Hotel Scene, the Interrogation Scene, and the Trailer Scene almost ruin the Movie, but doesn't because there is so much of the incredible. The Chases and the Armaments, the Action and Violence, make this worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arnie is back with another action, comedy thats well worth a watch. I have to admit that this film isn't particularly special from a formal cinematic point of view but it's just generally good fun and I want to emphasise that fact before you go to watch this film expecting cinematic genius!With witty humour, original characters well written dialogue and an extremely surreal amount of action I really did thoroughly enjoy every minute of this film. I would say that this film is one of my all time favourites simply because of how much I enjoyed watching it!Now lets talk about the people behind this 141 minutes of witty, original fun. The director (James Cameron) never fails to impress and there is no exception with True Lies.I have to say the acting in this film isn't exceptional, but still quite good. One of the main aspects of this film is the comedy, it is witty,presented with flair and ,although slightly clichéd, well written. The comedy is perfectly proportioned with the action and romance which I was relieved to find this because I think that is a common mistake with many of those genres. One thing you can be certain to see is A LOT of action throughout this 142 mins, there's plenty of explosions, gunfights, fist combat and mindless destruction, I mean, who wouldn't want to see Arnold schwartszenegger joyfully destroying a five story building with a harrier jump jet!Overall, not a cinematic masterpiece, not a disastrous waste of time, simply enjoyable, engaging and fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arnold's back - in yet another extremely silly, extremely enjoyable comedy-actioner, TRUE LIES, as superspy Harry Tasker, who leads the double life of a Bond-ish field agent and a suburban family man, his wife, Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis), and daughter (Eliza Dushku) oblivious to his "real" job, thinking he is a boring computer consultant.James Cameron writes and directs (remaking the 1991 Claude Ziti French movie, LA TOTALE!), so it's going to be bombastic, larger-than-life and speak in a funny accent.Funniest thing about TRUE LIES is - Tom Arnold. And we're not laughing AT him this time - we're actually digging his head-on, dead-on comedic delivery, as Arnold's superspy wingman, Gibson.Tia Carrera sloppily fills the femme fatale role as a glamorous front for Arab terrorists (hey! They're Arabs - they MUST be terrorists!), led by the robust Arab stylings of Art Malik (who is a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company and attended school in London, yet is forever typecast in Third World roles for his Pakistani birth roots.) Bill Paxton may be trying to outdo his Hudson pussy from ALIENS in a creamily sleazy comedic turn that almost outshines Tom Arnold's, as Simon the car salesman who pretends to be a spy to get women, happenstance leading him to Harry's wife as a panty prospect. (The last time Paxton and Schwarzenegger were on screen together was in TERMINATOR, with a naked Arnold beating up a punked Paxton for his clothes.) Tasker's wife discovers his spy life in the most inauspicious manner: bored with her home life, she gravitates to Simon, who claims to be an action man spy. When real spies Harry and Gibson find out, she is mock-kidnapped by them in disguise and sent on a fake spy job to scare her out of her action jones. On this job - where she performs a sensual striptease for her own husband, without realizing it is him - both she and Harry are captured by real terrorists.Lots of big orange explosions later, after some spectacular stunts (a motorbike leaping across skyscrapers, Jamie Lee Curtis hanging from a helicopter, Arnold in a Harrier jet) and absolutely ridiculous sequences (Arnold bodysliding downhill on snow, shooting jet-skiers behind him, a horse chasing a motorbike through a hotel, the terrorist clinging to the tail of the Harrier, Arnold doing the tango!), we actually leave this movie thankful it has stopped bombarding our Blockbuster Nerve.And go back to our double lives of lying to our spouses.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Thrill Ride of Action and Comedy!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not too many films have combined action and comedy as brilliantly as this excellent James Cameron thriller. True Lies excels at allowing the comedy to come directly from the situations without distracting the viewer from the exciting action story. Over the top action sequences alone can spell doom for any film, yet True Lies combines them with comic relief and still manages to stay riveting over a 2 hour and 20 minute run time. There's plenty of laughs here, yet none of them seem forced. All of the comedic moments come from the characters reactions to the events around them. In fact, there's not one moment where I as a viewer thought I might act differently had I been in the same situation.The chemistry between all the actors is apparent throughout the film. The pairings of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis as husband and wife, as well as Schwarzenegger and Tom Arnold as federal officers, seem outlandish before first viewing the film. Yet the casting is perfect. Some of the best laughs in the film come from moments where two of the characters simply exchange looks. Apparently all the actors got along famously on the set, and that always translates into great chemistry on the screen.Director James Cameron is well known for delivering exciting action sequences and he sets the bar very high here. Although over the top at times, you always buy it. Chase scenes seem to be Cameron's strongest set piece and he provides two especially thrilling sequences in True Lies. A chase through the streets of Washington DC and through a busy hotel is especially unique. Not just because of the locale, but because it involves a horse and a motorcycle. Also, the pursuit of the villains from the Florida Keys to the main land involving trucks, helicopters, and Harrier jets is the highlight of the film.Much has been made of the depictions of the villains from True Lies. Perhaps even in 1994 it was unfairly stereotypical to use fanatical Arab terrorists as your primary villain. However, the fact is that there are bad people of every race, religion, sex, or any other category you can think of for human beings. Was it an indictment on all German people when Hans Gruber led a group of German terrorists into Nakatomi Towers in the film Die Hard? Are all American's evil because Mr. Joshua was such a cruel villain in Lethal Weapon? Are all women deplorable because Selina was portrayed as villainous in Supergirl. Would it really have made a difference (or have been more realistic) if the villains were Portuguese terrorists? You get my point. And let's be fair to True Lies here too. It was 1994. In this film you hear terms like "Jihad" and "Car bomb." Terms that weren't even part of the vernacular in '94, yet are well known today. It could even be fair to say that True Lies was slightly ahead of its time. Is it really all that different from TV's 24? I would recommend True Lies to anyone who's looking for laughs and excitement. The two have never been combined as expertly as they are here. Both men and women can easily identify with the characters and should enjoy themselves equally. I can't believe it's been 15 years since True Lies was released. It still holds up wonderfully. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The spy thriller meets the domestic sit-com</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Tasker, an agent with the top secret Omega Force ("America's last line of defence") can be seen as an American James Bond. There is, however, a difference. Bond is a single man and a serial womaniser, who ends up bedding at least one woman, and normally two or more, in each of his screen outings. Harry is a happily married family man, living in the Washington suburbs with his wife Helen and their teenage daughter Dana. For security reasons Helen and Dana are not permitted to know that Harry is a secret agent, so they believe his official cover story that he is in fact a computer salesman.Helen, however, is becoming bored with her humdrum life and craves some excitement. She falls for the charms of Simon, who claims to be a spy but is in real life a used-car salesman. (The significance of the title "True Lies" is presumably that Helen falls for Simon because he falsely claims to be what, unknown to her, her husband really is). Harry learns of his wife's friendship with Simon and decides to make use of his agency's surveillance methods to learn more about their liaison. He has Helen kidnapped and, hoping to satisfy her craving for adventure, involves her in a mock spy operation. Things go wrong, however, and before long Helen and Dana are both embroiled in one of Harry's real-life operations, involving a terrorist gang who are smuggling nuclear weapons into the United States.This is one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's better films, and evidence of how far his acting career had progressed in just over a decade. In some of his early films, such as "Red Sonja" and the two "Conan" movies he was so ludicrously wooden that it was difficult to avoid the conclusion that he had been cast on the basis of his physique and nothing else. Even in films like "The Running Man" and "Total Recall" he was mediocre. He was, admittedly, more effective in "The Terminator", but even this role led to jibes about the appropriateness of casting him as an emotionless robot. By the time of "True Lies", however, his acting technique had greatly improved and he looks here far more confident and relaxed than he does in some of his earlier films, able not only to look the part of an action hero but to act the part as well. His gift for humour is also put to good use.This is also one of Jamie Lee Curtis' better films, a welcome return to form after the awful "Mother's Boys", although her acting performance attracted less critical attention than the striptease scene in which she got to show us just what a fine body she had for a woman in her mid thirties. Among the other contributions which stood out were those from the very attractive Tia Carrere as the sultry villainess Juno Skinner and Charlton Heston's cameo as Harry's boss Spencer Trilby.Although "True Lies" never takes itself too seriously, there are some memorable action sequences, such as the one where Harry, on horseback, pursues a terrorist, on a motorcycle, across the roof of a luxury hotel, or the finale in which Harry has to pilot a Harrier jump jet to which Dana is clinging for dear life. The film was conceived as an action thriller/comedy, a hybrid genre which can sometimes be difficult to get right. This blend of spy thriller and domestic sit-com, however, is one of the good ones, managing to blend humour and suspense in the style of the Bonds and some of Hitchcock's spy thrillers. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie will not disappoint in the least!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Plot: (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a special agent Harry Tasker - although to his wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis), he's just a boring computer salesman. When Harry's two lives unexpectedly collide, both he and Helen find themselves in the clutches of international terrorists fighting to save not only their marriage, but their lives. Directed by James Cameron and crammed with incredible special effects, True Lies is an exhilarating mix of non-stop action and romantic comedy. My Spiel: In one of the best spy/agent movies I have seen with the hands down sweet special effects for the time, and constant action. Arnold Schwarzenegger playing America's best operatives, spies, commandos, no matter how you classify him, he's a true bad ass. I highly enjoyed this movie and the way Arnold portrayed his character, when he finds his wife trying to cheat/leave him, but due to his government assets puts a halt to Helens plans, of what she believes is living a dull life. The good sides to this flick, if you are a Arnold action run and gun lovers, this movie will not disappoint in the least. In a time of enemy countries with the thought of bringing and importing nukes into this country (United States). As for the Negatives there isn't much to bitch about except the Uzi bit with Helen, but I have learned to let that slide over the years. But every time the main terrorist falls on the left side of the missile on the Harrier jet "Your Fired!" gets me pumped up that was truly a excellent conclusion to this Arnold movie. Something truly fresh and original at the time, and still entertains this person! True Lies (1994)Review: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fun movie, one I enjoy very much. It is completely outrageous, with a motorcycle/horse chase in a high-rise hotel, an atomic bomb explosion, the destruction of a bridge in the Florida keys, a Rambo-style shoot-out with uncountable dead bodies and huge fireball explosions, and the final rescue using a Harrier VTOL aircraft. But, in spite of the off-the-wall action, the movie is hilarious, due to one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's funnier performances, an outstanding comedic job by Jamie Lee Curtis, and humorous lines delivered by Tom Arnold. With good support roles played by Bill Paxton and Eliza Dushku, and excellent work by Tia Carrere and Art Malik, it is great escapism. Malik was also excellent in The Living Daylights, that time as a good guy, this time as the villain. The script is very entertaining, and I will enjoy watching this movie frequently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Action-Comedy, With a Sleazy Bll Paxton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a spy for a super secret government agency, along with his faithful buddy and sidekick Albert Gibson (Tom Arnold). His wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) is unaware of this until she finds herself getting directly involved by having something of an affair with a suspected terrorist Simon (Bill Paxton). Can Harry keep his secret safe from his wife and still save the world? "True Lies" is so incredibly bizarre. Director James Cameron, better known for blockbusters like "Titanic", is no stranger to action... but this is something different. Like another Schwarzenegger film from the same period ("Last Action Hero"), the line of action and comedy is blurred pretty extensively. Lots of jokes about terrorism that aren't probably as funny anymore, explosions and gunfire that's so over the top it can't even be believed in a movie.One of the most memorable and notorious scenes figures Jamie Lee Curtis in a strip tease. Now, I'm not a Curtis fan and I don't find her attractive, so this part is a bit disturbing for me. But, really, what is this? Who wanted this? And Curtis went along with it? If you did find Curtis attractive, this would be pretty steamy... she's not bad as a dancer. I can only suspect this was to help kill ongoing rumors that she is a hermaphrodite, but my opinion is unchanged in that regard.While I'm not big on action films (I like "Die Hard" and others fine, but don't seek them out and don't feel like I'm missing anything but not seeing some of the classics) this is a good one. Plenty of excessive violence without the bloodshed (because this is a family film). Some cheap laughs. And a romance story underneath it all... Harry's attempts to save his marriage while saving the world. (Don't worry, it doesn't get too romantic.) As far as romantic action comedies go, this one's among the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action epic with flare, story, and poking a little fun at itself and the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True Lies seems to be considered a stunning achievement in the world of action films to most fans and reviewers. It isn't hard to understand where that reputation comes from. True Lies is far beyond the average blow things up action film and is much more of an action epic. While it wasn't Schwarzenegger's last action film by any means, in many ways it was an homage to a legendary action career. The film is bestowed with a really terrific cast, terrific writing, a great story with actual depth on top of the mind blowing action scenes and a very talented respected director in James Cameron. The cast work so well together and the script is so nicely written with a perfect blend of humour and action. Personally I don't feel the film is mind blowingly good but I certainly give it due respect for being what it is. For being such a powerful action film it clocks in at nearly 2 1/2 hours and the centre of the film kind of sticks out from the rest of it as Schwarzenegger's character Harry sends his clueless wife Helen on an obscure 'fake' spy mission. It sort of sends the story into oblivion and really felt like it was dragging but then the end comes full circle and returns to full on action.I admit, I am a big Arnold Schwarzenegger fan especially his really terrific action films. The man is an action master. He proves just that and shows he can act playing part spy, part husband hiding his job Harry Trasker. Nobody delivers the cheesy one liners like Schwarzenegger "You're Fired." He is built for this movie and he just fits into it perfectly. In the beginning as he takes on a mansion full of terrorists on a snow covered hill in a tux you could say he could have been the next James Bond. Nobody could have done this better. Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant in her role as bored housewife Helen Trasker. Her and Schwarzenegger are just awesome together and have terrific chemistry as strange as they are together. They play off each other brilliantly and make the perfect couple somehow. She is sexy when she needs to be, meek when she needs to be and just kicks some serious butt. She plays one of the best female action roles in the history of film in this movie. Tom Arnold is a terrific sidekick to Schwarzenegger. His humour and timing is not over used so he never gets the chance to be obnoxious which is often the case with him. In fact he is one of my favourite characters in the film and could have almost been used more. He has great chemistry as well with Schwarzenegger and they make a terrific team. Art Malik is decent as the main villain in the film but he just doesn't hold your attention and doesn't seem like an all powerful villain or anything memorable like say Hans Gruber from Die Hard or Ivan Korshunov or Air Force One. His unknown status makes him seem like not a good match for Schwarzenegger but he does alright. Add in some really terrific supporting cameos like Bill Paxton (in a hilarious little role as a scumbag womanizer), Charlton Heston, Eliza Dushku and in a slightly bigger supporting role Tia Carrere gives one of her best performances as villainess Juno Skinner (who makes a better main villain than Malik I think and has some great scenes opposite Curtis.) True Lies entertains on more levels than your average action flick. Guys will be floored by the breath taking action scenes and explosions and Schwarzenegger kicking some butt, and girls will love the romance aspect between Harry and Helen and also like watching Curtis kick some serious butt so it's really made for anyone that likes adrenaline. What is remarkable is that they didn't serialize True Lies with sequels that I actually think could have been done very well and had a terrific follow up or even a trilogy. I know it was talked about but this kind of film is ripe for sequels but never happened and quite likely never will. There certainly were a fair share of poor special effects editing like the numerous times you can see Schwarzenegger's stunt double square in the face as he performs certain stunts and some the poorer done action scenes but overall when you've put something like this together it's bound to an action classic so definitely see it!! 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to know why. Please, someone answer me.Because, in most American movies I see good American guys against bad Muslim guys. I ask: there are no bad Jews, no bad Christian people? It's curious because Schwarzenegger always fight commies, Muslims, Latin people. Chuck Norris, Dolph Lundgren, Stallone do the same. After all, who is against uncle SAM is fought and defeated in the screen. But in Actual life, things are not this way. In a fight body to body, an American soldier is not superior to any soldier, I mean, there are no Rambo, Braddock's or john matrix( from commando) in a true war. And the fame of American courage is only against old people, women and children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"True Lies" asks the viewer to suspend disbelief and accept that a super-secret American anti-terrorism agency will hire a hulking, monosyllabic, musclebound foreign national as one of its top operatives. Well, this is an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie after all.In spite of the preposterous premise, James Cameron's direction will sweep you along on a toboggan ride of stunts, thrills, gadgets and guns. The story's not half bad either. Nixxing what could have been another pathetic American sub-Bond movie, the screenwriters contrive to have our hero living a normal married-with-child life in suburbia when he's not busy being a spy.There's a neat sub-plot about the unsuspecting wife wanting more excitement in her life and hitching up with a fake spy plus the usual daughter-going-off-the-rails domestic drama. Despite Eliza Dushku turning in a (mostly) understated performance as the daughter, this is the only element of the story that feels forced.In these post-WTC-attack times, Art Malik's Arab terrorist almost comes across as a doomed-to-fail Disney villain. World events have moved on from the idea of a small band of inept North African headcases shanghai-ing a bunch of ex-Soviet nukes being even slightly scary, but Malik impresses with his performance. Never lurching into full comedy villain mode, Malik's Aziz is a chillingly methodical character whose outbursts are carefully timed to create the maximum degree of unrest in friend and foe alike.Tom Arnold has never been better as sidekick/comic relief Gib. He manages to avoid upstaging the star despite being handed some of the best one-liners in movie history. Bill Paxton also performs well as the weaselly car salesman who pretends to be a super-spy in order to bed bored housewives. Tia Carrere provides some welcome evil eye candy as well as a strong supporting performance.A special mention has to go to Jamie Lee Curtis for her role as the dowdy wife who transforms herself into a high-heeled minx in less time than it takes to watch a cosmetics commercial. This is one of her stand-out roles and she gets to demonstrate her both her impeccable comic timing and her impromptu pole-dancing skills to devastating effect in "True Lies"Worth watching for the pole-dancing scene alone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In an unchanging world of terror, only Arnie has transformed himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not being an Arnie fan, I gave this one a miss the first time round, but write this review now, 11 years after the film's making, having recently seen it on TV.True Lies is a comedy action-thriller, based on a pretty deplorable idea. Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a top American ass-kicking secret agent; but from before and throughout his marriage to wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) Harry has maintained the fiction to her and daughter Dana (Eliza Dushku) that he is a meek and mild computer salesman. Perhaps even more deplorable is that when after some 15 years of lying Harry finds out that Helen is possibly seeing another man - partly due to his own neglect of her - he becomes incensed, and uses all the resources of his agency to subject her to, not one, but two terrifying ordeals, the second with some unsavoury sexual overtones.Director James Cameron just about gets away with this distasteful storyline because (a) there's some reasonable comic acting by Arnie and Jamie - remember this was before Arnie revealed his full powers as a humorist by becoming Governor of California; (b) Helen is allowed to sock Harry pretty hard, several times, when at the end of the second ordeal she finally recognises him; and (c) the film then immediately moves into full action mode, as Harry and Helen are kidnapped by terrorists, led by menacing fanatic Khaled (Marshall Manesh).From then on, it's formula, formula, formula; and SFX, SFX, SFX until the closing credits, with the usual nuclear warhead threats, multiple killings of the baddies, hair-raising escapes by our heroes, and a few laughs along the way. The final episode, with Harry doing amazing manoeuvres with a VTO fighter aircraft, stretches credibility beyond breaking point, but in this sort of movie WTF.What IS credible and depressing about this film is that although it was made 11 years ago, and a full 7 years before 9/11, if the screenplay were submitted to Hollywood today, not one word or piece of action would need to be changed - same terrorists from the same part of the world, threatening to use the same hardware, for the same reasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fan Drools, Arnold Rules</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Goodness.I watched this again last night, for about the umpteenth time. I got it on DVD finally -- my daughter and I wore out the video tape.What do we love? Everyone blends well together. Tom Arnold is funny, Arnold is funny, Jamie Lee is funny, Grant is funny -- and they aren't trying to be, they just work so well together, and they're a riot! I think my favorite bit is Gib (Tom Arnold) and Fasil (Grant Heslov) hassling Harry (Arnie! Arnie! Arnie!) about "the babe at the party" Juno Skinner (Tia Carrera) -- after she danced the tango with Harry at the party, Juno was "ready to bear his children", so learning that they need to "send in a specialist", Gib asks Fasil to dance, and Fasil accepts, and they start to waltz in front of the data center with the most ridiculous looks on their faces, while Harry mutters, "Assholes." These are GUYS, and they work together, and this is what people are like when they work at something they love.Fact is, every scene with these three is priceless, from the beginning when Gib is trying to race down an ice-covered road, to him returning Harry's belongings as he morphs back into his "normal" life, and the way their boss, Spencer Trilby (Charlton Heston, Oh, My!!), cuts them all to pieces for messing up their latest mission, but cuts them slack as well because he trusts them to get their work done, to Gib's comment to Harry after his firefight on the remote island with the terrorists, "I thought this looked like your work!" -- their working together is great, their relationship, their friendship, it's all very believable and a lot of fun to watch! The end is a scream, too, it's its own little story, five minutes of slapstick, when Helen (Jamie Lee) and Harry are on a mission to meet some contact at a new and different party -- Helen spots Simon (Bill Paxton -- oh, my, GAWD, the man has a future as a stand-up comedian!) and threatens to "do him right here" -- and the poor guy is true to form, while Harry watches his wife admiringly, and then they dance, with Gib complaining to them both in the background: his relationship with Helen has graduated to the same level of camaraderie as his with Harry by this point, it's supremely obvious.This is one of my all-time favorite movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a good, fun action flick- some details, no real spoilers...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, this is one of the best action flicks ever. It has fun with itself &amp; the characters. I won't recap the story, there are many reviews here already that do that. To the show then: Arnold as Harry Tasker is just right for this part. It's filled with one-liners like "cool-off, you're fired," etc. (It's also interesting that one of Arnold's film heroes is Clint Eastwood who really made the "one-liner" famous in his Dirty Harry series of movies.) Arnold's acting is perfect for the part. He's funny &amp; charming and even sincere when he needs to be. Hey... he must be a pretty good actor, after all, he's governor of California, right? Jamie Lee Curtis as Helen Tasker, is well cast as the na?ve innocent wife who knows nothing of her husband's (Arnold) undercover agent activities. In a scene where she is being interrogated by her husband (behind a two-way mirror) she gives a few seconds of the most sincere acting I've ever seen when she says she loves her husband. Good stuff! And the "striptease" scene is just perfect. I have to hand it to James Cameron, he knows what he's doing. On the "trivia" page it says that she was nervous about the scene, had sweaty palms and actually falls for real on accident. Arnold even starts to get up to help her, but she continued the scene, and Cameron liked it so much he left it in. And it's PERFECT! It adds just the right amount of humor to a steamy scene (much like the strap breaking in Jerry Maguire) to lighten it up and to make her character as housewife turned agent seem even more believable. (Jamie Lee did her own helicopter stunt too... ) Tom Arnold as the sidekick Gib for Harry (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has some of the best lines in the movie. You won't forget his dialog, it's great. Even so, there are reality checks now &amp; then. As Gib he tries to cheer Harry up about his cheating wife. He tells him it happens and a few more funny lines. Then when Harry blows it, tells him to stop cheering him up, Gib seriously says, "what did you expect Harry? Helen's a flesh &amp; blood woman &amp; you're never there, it was just a matter of time." Then he brings the comedy back on track with, "you know what? I say we concentrate on work buddy, that's what I do every time my life turns to dogsh*t, I concentrate on work &amp; that gets me by." But in a way, even that is tongue in cheek because there are so many people that do just that in an effort to concentrate on anything but what really means most, family and love. He also has some great lines about his kid's parents being Madonna &amp; Axel Rose, saying that the constant bombardment from then can't compete with the 5 mins a day he spends with his daughter. Hmmm, another well couched message of family and love. Anyway, he has some truly funny lines! Finally, Bill Paxton as the pseudo-agent, Simon is hilarious. As his role unfolds, we find out a lot about him and the more we know, the funnier he gets. Also has many good lines! (But I got 'em lining up, and not just the skanks either! well, some of them...) All in all, just a good movie with great writing &amp; direction, fun to watch, well paced and still manages to have a heart. The special effects are good, music is well done, and the production values are excellent to say the least. Just a fun night of fun. (oh... and don't let the fact that the people he's fighting as an agent are Muslims distress you- this movie isn't anti-anything. Any story has to have an antagonist or adversary- this movie is pre 9/11 so it had no agenda, just a plot.) BTW, read all the trivia for this movie, you'll find out some interesting things about this movie! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnold at his best...almost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apart from the Terminator movies, this is undoubtedly Arnold Schwarzenegger's best film. The action is great and the plot, although somewhat clichéd is well supported by the characters. The comedy sprinkled throughout the movie is in the perfect spots and amount. Tom Arnold's role as the comic to Arnold's action makes their partnership work. Jamie Curtis' work is great and she really gets the "In over her head but doesn't know it" role down pat. One of the best parts about the movie is some of the innovation in the action. Be it Harry's chasing a motorcycle-driving terrorist through a hotel on a horse, Helen's inadvertent killing of several terrorists by accidentally dropping her gun down a flight of stairs or how Harry kills Aziz by shooting the missile he's hanging on into a helicopter full of terrorists, the scenes are innovative and fresh. The movie is easily in my top ten action movies.The only thing I feel detracts from the movie is the Simon/Helen subplot. Of course, it's necessary for the plot to advance, but it didn't seem very well acted out.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid action film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzenegger the star of The Terminator rejoins with director James Cameron (The Terminator, Titanic) in this action packed thrill ride. Also starring Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween) and Tom Arnold, whom plays the perfect side-kick.Harry Tasker is a family man, aptly loved by his wife and young rebellious daughter. He has quite the life; a large house, and a well-paying nine-to-five job as a computer technology sales representative. However, as modest as Harry's life seems, he does have his dirty little secret. However, this one isn't so little. Harry is a secret agent with the Omega Sector. Thing is, his wife Helen doesn't know about this secret double-life that takes up so much of Harry's time, even after some odd 15 years of marriage. On this particular occasion Harry is up against a terrorist faction known as Crimson Jihad, led by led by the extremely unstable Salim Abu Aziz). The trail leads him to beautiful art dealer Juno Skinner, who seems to take more than a professional interest in Harry.While Harry is off defending the world from terrorists and such, Helen is secretly meeting with Simon (Bill Paxton), a man she believes to be an international spy. In reality, Simon is nothing more than a used car salesman, and a sleazy one at that. Harry begins to suspect that something is not right at home, and uses all the resources at his disposal to confirm his suspicions about his wife's infidelity. Harry devises and elaborate scheme to try and put some sparkle back into his marriage.Unfortunately, just as Harry prepares to put his plan into action, both he and Helen are kidnapped by Crimson Jihad. The terrorists have managed to obtain three nuclear warheads and are planning to detonate them in major American cities, unless their demands for the release of certain political prisoners are met.True Lies is a great ride, a real clever mix of humor and action, even a little bit of drama for good measure. Suffice it to say, had this film been directed by anyone else other than Cameron, it would have suffered. So enjoy the movie.</fullReview>

The limousine scenes running out of control with Jamie Lee having to be pulled up and out of the vehicle by Arnold in a helicopter were great, very exciting. I also really enjoyed the scenes of Arnold in the aircraft as he saved his daughter (Dushku) and fired on the terrorists. Bill Paxton was perfect as the used car salesman.

		<fullReview>I could go on at length about the awesomeness of Arnie and the awesomeness of James Cameron. In fact, I probably have in other reviews. 'True Lies' was directed by James Cameron, and starred Arnie, and therefore, has the double the awesomeness of most awesome movies ('The Terminator' and 'Terminator 2' also enjoy the double-awesome factor of Arnie and James Cameron). Awesome.'True Lies' is a fun, action-spy movie that never takes itself to seriously. Arnie plays Harry Tasker. His family think he is a regular businessman, when he is actually a spy working for America's last line of defense, Omega Sector. While Tasker is trying to take down a terrorist group called "Crimson Jihad", while suspecting his wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) of cheating on him. Such a combination would defeat us mere mortals, but not Arnie...'True Lies' is great fun right from the beginning, from Arnie's James Bond-inspired ski-sequence to the finale on the flying Harrier Jump-jet. This is action / comedy perfection. We have nice action, plenty of explosions, stereotypical and nasty bad dudes and dudettes, and the greatest one-liner ever: "You're fired!". So awesome.Simply put, 'True Lies' is awesome, and one Arnie's greatest works (ditto to James Cameron) - 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnold and Cameron team up for OK spoof.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True Lies is not Arnold's best outing, but has its enjoyable moments with great direction from James Cameron. Arnold plays harry a secret agent that has been hiding that secret from his wife (Curtis) for years now. The plot mainly revolves around Terrorist, yes could it be Arab terrorist being portrayed in a movie and not evil white men, called Crimson Jihad, who want to blow up cities in America with nuclear devices if their usual nonsense is not met. Arnold along with his partner Gibson (Tom Arnold) track down the major players in the network one being played by Tia Carrere, and end up eliminating the jihad scum the way they should be. The movie has some good action scenes and shots, but is over shadowed by a rather slow story and side stories that although are funny, should have probably have been left out. The side story about Arnold's wife cheating with Paxton's character is funny though. Arnold has some ok one liners and kicks some ass, but not the way he did in the 80's. Among his movies of the 90's this is one of the better ones, but that's not saying much. Cameron is a great director and does a great job with this movie, but it is a spoof on action flicks, so don't expect it to be to serious. Overall I would have to give this a 6 and half out of ten stars, and OK movie but not great. Good to see right now though with the stupid muslims we are fighting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like Last Action Hero, this does not take itself seriously, paying homage to Bond, and is better because of it. You may say it is sexist, its treatment of women is questionable, and racist, with all those crazed Arabs running around, but this is not deliberate, and while it can be disturbing, it should not spoil an entertaining, explosive film. I won't go into the plot because I'll be here all day, but it boils down to Arnie saving the world, and his family. The action is of top quality, the dialogue is faster than many Bond movies, and the cast is fair enough. Paxton, in another collaboration with Cameron and Arnie, is the highlight, as a used car salesman who pretends to be a spy, just so he can get the ladies. Every scene he is in is electric. So, if you are wary of the subtexts, you'll enjoy it, but unfortunately many people find them too sickening to avoid. 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ONLY movie that meets ALL of my criteria !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie has to meet (some of) my criteria before I consider it a good movie. True Lies exceeds that criteria.Criteria 1-- The hero must be faced with a moral challenge and get through the challenge without compromise. Harry, in True Lies, does that. His spy missions jeopardize his marriage, however, he never crosses the line.Criteria 2-- There must be a chase scene. In this movie there is a chase scene on foot, in snow, motorcycle, limo, helicopter, even horse!!! The chase scenes are one right after the other. I don't know of any other movie that has more chase scenes.Criteria 3-- Hi-Tech Toys. While Harry cannot compete with James Bond in the hi-tech toy arena, this movie has several cool toys.Criteria 4-- Humor. Let's face it, good humor goes a long way. In True Lies, Harry tries to get a 'police' horse to jump from one high rise bldg to another and just at the last minute the horse stops the jump. Harry admonishes the horse for this by asking the horse "What kind of cop are you, anyway? You let the bad guy get away." The elevator scene with the horse and the high classed elderly couple (also) cracks me up!.Criteria 5-- There must be a dance scene. True Lies has several. Take your pick. Tango, striptease, waltz. Que hala!!!! A lot of bedroom happiness can be attributed to Jamie Lee Curtis's classy performance without compromise of her marriage vows.So, there you have it. My criteria. True Lies is the only movie that rates number one on all accounts!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schwarzenegger show why he can set records at the box office</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WOW, I just absolutely love this movie. I have no complaints at all, I was throughly entertained like almost all movies Arnold Schwarzenegger does. The action, direction, acting and "James Cameron humour" were all there.One thing I would like to comment on is the stereotype of Muslims/Arab as terrorists. Watching this movie after September 11, 2001, the statement Aziz makes to the video camera (before it ran out of battery power of coarse LOL) is very similar to the types of statements made by another well known non-fiction terrorist, Osama Bin-Laden. Islamic terrorism is now not just a threat but THE threat to public/western interests. So I guess this movie was sort of ahead of its time.Conclusion, if you life has nothing to do with politics, watch this movie and be entertained like this movie was intended to do. 10/10</fullReview>

Of course, I'm sad to say that some people mistake comedy for an attack on Islamic beliefs, etc. Unfortunately, they fail to realize that it is entertainment, not a treatise on the evils of Islamic terrorists. It is FOR FUN. Did the Catholics give a big hullabaloo over Dogma? No! Do African American Protestants picket theaters that show any of the Nutty Professor movies? No! These people realize that it is a strictly for fun. Maybe some people don't understand the difference between fun and seriousness; and those people are the ones who miss out on great experiences like True Lies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last month I did something stupid and saw Triple-X. Everything you could think of, that movie lacked. Plot, characters, even decent action. I went home and popped this in my VCR--BOY WHAT A DIFFERENCE! True Lies isn't James Cameron's best film, most consider it his worst, (I will beg differ after his exceptionally awful TITANIC) but it is a well drawn out film that tells TWO stories in THREE acts unlike other action films of this sort. Usually the first act will be introducing characters and giving us some background. True Lies starts with action, develops another storyline, then concludes both in the third act.Many criticized True Lies for being racist, NOT TRUE! How come people don't say Die Hard stereotypes Germans as nazist mass-murderers and no one says the Godfather movies stereotype Italian-Americans as violent gangsters?! "They drew first blood", remember that. It's a matter of educated viewpoints--much like saying whether or not Huckleberry Finn is racist. Low regard for women is another matter. The action in the film--though sparse compared to Aliens, Terminator 1 &amp; 2--is fun, glossy and full of enough trinitroluene to get your batteries blasting to the brim. I especially love Arnold's utilization of a few lumps of Pb and commercially modified hydrocarbons to make one singeing scene.For gadgets, shifting plots (well, not all that shifty), guns, knockout punches, and some of Arnold's best lines, you can't miss with this! If you DO want racism, merely browse the internet for about 5 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film can simply be remembered as one of Arnie's best. Once again reuniting with 'Terminator' director James Cameron, Schwarzenegger delivers an absolutely explosive action film, with amazing stunts and great visuals. Jamie Lee Curtis plays brilliantly against Arnold, the two showing their family life to a tee. Tom Arnold brings his own style of comic relief to the film, which works wonderfully throughout. Bill Paxton plays the part of the lying used car salesman to perfection, allowing us to see why and how Arnold's character, Harry is saddened and annoyed by him. Art Malik brings a distinct edge to the film, with Charlton Heston's character giving an bond-type atmosphere to the whole film.The scenes are sensationally filmed, the dialogue sharp, and the comedy perfect. And then of course, there is the unforgettable 'dance' scene with Jaime Lee...10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More action and thrills than laughs but it has plenty of them as well. This is a nice role for Arnie, which takes in his appeal in exactly the right proportions. He always works best in tandem with another actor (Belushi, Devito - even Linda Hamilton) and the 90s goofball par excellence Tom Arnold is just about right, if a little manic. Jamie Lee Curtis is an above average female co-star although she's less well appropriated. Her key moment is a very embarrassing pole-dancing sequence: she's a pro though and with her super body many people will see it as a highlight of the movie.Above all it's a James Cameron movie rather than an 'Arnie' (Predator constitutes an 'Arnie' for me) so it's got quite a punch. I also think Robert Laing's art direction has a lot to do with the success of a film which clearly wants to outdo Bond and has a good go at it. 6/10</fullReview>

There is a little bit of humor, action, action, action, action, more action, and .5% of sexuality that is disturbing to see Arnold go at with Jamie Lee Curtis. "True Lies" is a great movie. I wouldn't mind watching it again. But like I said, there is just something lacking a bit that didn't make this the next "Terminator". Or even big enough for the box office like "Titanic".

		<fullReview>I know, my title is probably not the best if you want to get a good idea of the movie, but it shows perfectly how I feel about it. YES, because it was very funny from time to time (especially when he thinks his wife is cheating on him), NO because the action scenes were a bit too 'over the top' for me (especially at the end of the movie). I know what to expect when I'm watching an action movie, so no, I don't mind some explosions and fighting scenes, that's all part of the genre. Without them this wouldn't be an action movie, but there is still a line that shouldn't be crossed. I still want the action to be a bit believable and this wasn't always the case in "True Lies".Arnold Schwarzenegger is Harry Tasker, a very predictable and rather boring family man who's married, who has one daughter and who works as a sales representative for a computer company. At least, that's what his family believes, because in reality he is an agent for some secret service who lives a very dangerous, but hidden life. He is on the trail of some stolen nuclear weapons from the former Soviet Union that now are in the hands of some fanatic Arabic terrorists. But then something more important comes up. Harry finds out that his wife is seeing another man because she needs some adventure in her life. He decides to give that adventure to her, to give her a "secret" job for the secret service that he works for. In the mean while he will stop the terrorists from detonating the nuclear bombs in America.I'm sure many people will love all the action in this movie and they sure will get some good value for their money. They'll see a lot of explosions, spectacular shoot outs, even Arnie flying in a fighter jet. Personally I was a big fan of this movie, until the second half, when all the action with all the terrorists started. At first this seemed like a very nice action comedy, which really had all the ingredients I was looking for, but than it all went wrong. I want to believe a lot of things, but not everything that was shown to me in this movie. Arnie flying a jet, rescuing his daughter with it from a sky scraper, shooting a rocket through the building to a helicopter while a man is hanging on the rocket... No thank you, that's a bit too much for me. I'm probably one of the few who saw this movie who thinks about it that way, but if the action had been a bit less, I would have rewarded with better points. Now I give it a 5/10. My advice: only for the real Arnie addicts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Cameron packed a lot of stuff in True Lies. Explosive stuff, handle with care. It's one thing to think big and another matter altogether to mix genres.Arnold Schwarzenegger is not a good actor, everybody knows it. James Cameron thus goes for the spy spoof. The problem here is Schwarzy was not given a big enough sidekick to make his stiffness look funny. His stiffness is seriousness with a square-boned jaw smile. So he can't carry the movie.On the other hand Jamie Lee Curtis plays it straight, as if it was a dead serious plot about desperate housewives. The Simon subplot, though a highlight of the original story, plays like dead-serious characters meet the dead-serious loony spies.The best scenes are certainly the action scenes, provided they're not verging too much on the spoofy dumb villain vs. clumsy hero.On the whole a mixture that's not really convincing. Tongue-in-cheek humor is fine once you have a tight plot with straight actors. Tongue in cheek + spoof is more like "anything goes", let's have fun, nobody gives a fuss about the whole thing clinging together. 'nuff said: True Lies might have been a great movie if they'd have had less fun writing it and toiled more to make it a tongue-in-cheek spy thriller.</fullReview>

Some of the action gets to the point where it is so unrealistic it's comic. Watch out for the fairly lame (as far as action scenes go) scene with a horse. Flashbacks of The Last Boy Scout horse scene. Ouch.The film is too inconsistent with the script and action too far-fetched for me to watch it again.

		<fullReview>True Lies is about the double life of a man (Schwarzenegger) who by night - lives as a secret agent dealing with international terrorists, and by day (or the bits in-between), an ordinary middle-America family man. He soon suspects that his wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) is having an affair with a "pretend" spy, but ends up getting himself and his wife implicated with the Crimson Jihad - a splinter terrorist group hell bent on nuking the States.This movie is highly disappointing, considering its pedigree of its director (James Cameron - director of the classics the Terminator and Aliens) and its star (to some extent - Arnie). It is basically a screw-ball comedy with a few expensive looking action sequences thrown in the mix. The plot just seems so naive dealing with its subject of terrorism - the Crimson Jihad - what a silly name! Also the plot seems quite ludicrous - Jamie Lee Curtis wants to have an affair with a goofy looking Bill Paxton over Arnie?!... What the?! I guess for an action comedy - it isn't too bad - but when you think about who made this movie - it is terribly disappointing! Corny with a capital "C"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Bond of Suburbia.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been a little over a decade since Arnold Schwarzenegger has been hamming it up on screen, dominating as that action hero you know will in the end always get the job done. Indeed, much of the action sequences are inspired greatly by those old warhorse action movies: the James Bond series. What happens in between will frustrate some, though I didn't feel it was completely unnecessary, mostly because there is quite a bit of humor laced throughout. I must start out by declaring that this is James Cameron's weakest film. This must be attributed to the fact that the plot itself is not very strong, thus leading to some less than stellar sequences that don't add up to much. Yet, once again, the action sequences stand out as beyond anything I have seen in the majority of action films since this one. Cameron continues in every single one of his films to push the bar not just in special effects, but also in the sheer quality and expansion of his vision. He never lets up when feeding us explosions and crazy stunts and I lapped that up. What this film truly lacks is any complex or interesting characters. Everyone from Arnie's Harry Tasker to Jamie Lee Curtis's boring wife Helen simply do and don't have much conviction to them. Watching this movie, I truly felt it was being acted out, not thoroughly convincing. The hero is typically flawed but decent, the wife boring but craving excitement, the daughter estranged from her folks and the villain eagerly wanting world domination. So much of the plot exists in stereotypes, I am not surprised many feminists and Arabs were upset over the depiction of their respective groups. The plot follows the typical Bond story, even including a femme fatale that tries to get on the hero's good side. The big twist included here is that this Bond is married, which gives some interesting tidbits of ideas such as Harry wondering if his wife is having an affair and intertwining that with his covert operations (which I doubt is realistic). Yet, overall the film drags quite a bit in the middle and leaves much to be desired. The opening and closing action sequences are quite amazing as you wonder yet again how Cameron was able to do that. Nevertheless, story is key and there is not much of one here. However, I must confess that James Cameron is for me one of the great auteurs of the last half century. Of his seven features, five of them can be argued as either great or masterpieces. While True Lies doesn't come close to the incredible scope and ambition of films like Aliens or Titanic, Cameron is unable to make a film so static and uninteresting that it is so forgettable. But if he happened to do so, this would be the biggest qualifier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but could be better and funnier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True Lies, is a film that you already know what it's going to be like even before you watch it. I mean just look at the front cover of the DVD case. It's Arnold Schwarzenegger holding a hand cannon. And that sums up the movie basically. Which I'm personally not complaining. The action scenes are great in the movie anyway; I think that has partially to do with the fact that James Cameron is the director. Cameron's films usually always have great special effects, and astonishing action scenes. Which this film is no exception, the action scenes are extremely entertaining, and you always are pleased, even if they are over the top.So you may be wondering why I gave this film 6 out of 10. That is because of the sub plot. But first let me describe the real plot. Arnold Schwarzenegger is special agent Harry Tasker although his family doesn't know he's a special agent, When Harry's two lives collide, his wife Helen (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) and himself, become captured by international terrorists they must fight in order to save their lives etc. The subplot involves a con man of sorts played by Bill Paxton, who tries to seduce and make love to Harry's wife. Which Harry eventually finds out about and becomes jealous of Paxton. The two problems I have with this subplot is one it goes on too long, taking up about fifty minutes of the two-hour and a half run time. And two it tries to become a mix of an action and romantic comedy film. Which sometimes it does okay at, but other times it doesn't. The film does have a good supporting cast, Tom Arnold, Art Malik, Tia Carrere, and Charlton Heston. And as I've said before the comedy is hit or miss. The action scenes are amazing, and not cgi. And one scene in particular with Jamie Lee Curtis, will really please us guys. Overall a decent action flick but it could've been better had it not gone with the romantic comedy subplot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Growing up I had a fascination with the mindless action films of the 1980's, as I'm sure many boys my age did. And while I've come to realize that Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't the greatest actor of all time as I had once thought, I still enjoy a bit of campy action, and few films manage to entertain as much as True Lies. The key to the films appeal is that unlike most action flicks, it doesn't take itself seriously. It has the classic action plot: secret agent fights America-hating terrorists. While starting out like many action films, True Lies shifts gears when the agent (Schwarzenegger) discovers his wife (Curtis) may be having an affair. Upon learning that all she really wants is a little excitement in her banal suburban existence, Arnold decides to give her exactly what she wants. As you might have guessed, this takes a turn for the worse and Arnold ends up having to save his family from the terrorists in addition to saving the country. While it uses nearly every cliché in the book, it's done in a lighthearted and well directed way that makes the movie a blast to watch. The frequent humor is actually funny, and the action is very well done (and, as usual, completely over-the-top). The one liners are great, and Curtis' legendary striptease is one of cinema's greatest guilty pleasures. While certainly not academy award material, even the acting is well done. Arnold is at his best as the over-the-top agent. Curtis is excellent as a neurotic housewife, and Tom Arnold works surprisingly well as the wise-cracking sidekick. And Charlton Heston's cameo is simply brilliant. True Lies is the ultimate action flick. Cameron took a tired genre and struck gold. Is it a great cinematic achievement? No, but it sure is a blast to watch.</fullReview>

Even Jamie Lee Curtis (who should have been embarrassed accepting this role) nor Tom Arnold could help carry this one. Although most spy thrillers tend to test the realm of believability, this one just extends into the region of absurdity without the element of simply being entertainment. Absolute junk and a waste of time. This is one movie that exemplified Arnold's limitations and clearly demonstrates that this type of role is way out of bounds for his level of limited acting skills.</fullReview>

The only difference from the Bond formula is a silly subplot involving Arnold's wife's (Curtis) rendezvous with a doofus used car salesman. Like the Bond films, the plot becomes increasingly ludicrous and the non-stop action becomes rather tedious after a while. The film also does not know when to roll the final credits.

I'd personally rate it as his 2nd best behind the sci-fi horror classic THE TERMINATOR (1984). Neither ALIENS nor T2 have held up over time (don't care what so many Cameronites say!). T2 still has eye-popping effects, but dated dialogue and weak acting; ALIENS is dated in every way, shape, and form and cringe-inducing to watch now. And I don't know what TITANIC is supposed to be! But TRUE LIES is a standout amongst Cameron films for 2 big reasons: (1) It's got the great Arnold Schwarzenegger (this time as the central character, unlike in either of the Terminator films he did with Cameron) carrying the proceedings from start to finish with his usual deadpan aplomb as well and (2) it is drop dead HILARIOUS! It's actually one of the funniest action films ever put to screen. One thing you can't dispute in a movie is humor. Funny is funny, no matter how it is presented. The humor in TRUE LIES is spot-on and assured the entirety of the film and a big reason why it's still so immensely watchable today.Schwarzenegger is entirely convincing in one of his very best film performances as Harry Tasker, living a double life as a secret agent, who happens to have a wife and daughter that think he is just a salesman. This could very well be Arnie's BEST performance, as does a great job skillfully balancing his tough guy persona along with being a domesticated man with a family. This is an incredibly assured performance. Jamie Lee Curtis is rock solid in a screwball performance as Harry's frumpy, daffy (and bored!) wife Helen. Eliza Dushku is also good as Harry's rebellious (and somewhat delinquent) teenaged daughter.Tia Carrere is sexy as femme fatale Juno Skinner and Art Malik is appropriately menacing as terrorist Aziz, Harry's targets. But the 2nd best performance of the film belongs to none other than Tom Arnold (yep!) as Harry's partner Gib; Arnold gets most of the funny lines in the movie and he is pitch perfect throughout. I dare say this should have garnered him a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Who would have thought that Arnie and Tom would make such a perfect yin-yang pairing?...Not me! TRUE LIES is a structurally interesting film has a comedic middle part that runs for close to an hour, and is bookended by big action sequences. But of course there is a healthy amount of comedy in the action parts as well. The middle part is definitely the most entertaining as it includes an extended cameo role by Bill Paxton, giving a deliciously funny self-deprecating performance as a fake spy trying to put the moves on Helen. Legendary Charlton Heston also lends his weight to the proceedings as Harry's agency boss.What's amazing about TRUE LIES is the witty and clever dialogue, which is still fresh as it was when the movie first came out. The film is definitely a parody on 80s action films, James Bond. You'll see signs of Arnie's previous films (like TOTAL RECALL and COMMANDO) as he gets to play a combination of the characters he did in that one. Arnie and Jamie Lee are also quite convincing as a married couple. The action scenes are great (including a horse-motorcycle chase through the streets of D.C. and a Harrier jet at the climax), but COMEDY is the key to the eternal watchability of TRUE LIES!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Cameron isn't evil, he's not an a**hole like Spielberg. He wants to be the new De Mille. Unfortunately, he can't direct his way out of a paper bag." - Jacques Rivette "If the Gulf War gave you an insatiable taste for burning oil and burning Arabs, this extravaganza will tide you over for at least a couple of days." - Jonathan RosenbaumJames Cameron, director of the hug-a-minority "Avatar", directs "True Lies", a xenophobic action fantasy in which Arnold Schwarzenegger struts about like an Aryan Ubermensh whilst bashing incompetent Arabs. In the mid 90s, the film was the highest rented movie on American military bases. Hoo rah!The plot? Arnie plays a secret agent who hides his violent life from his wife and daughter. They think he's a boring office worker. In reality he's a cross between Rambo and James Bond, effortlessly dispatching bad guys, disarming nukes and saving the world. The film's a remake of "La Totale!", a dull French film. Cameron keeps 80 percent of "La Totale's!" plot but adds some James Bond homages (his intro is "Goldfinger's" etc) and the biggest, most audacious action sequences money could buy in 1994. Upon release, "True Lies" was reportedly the most expensive movie ever made. As is typical of Cameron, the film looks immaculate, the director bringing his trademark perfectionism to each shot. Several of the film's action sequences also have the massive, logistical ballsiness we associate with Cameron's later work. The guy doesn't take "impossible!" for an answer. Unfortunately as Cameron's films get slicker, bigger and more expensive, they also get less interesting and less intense than his work in the 1980s. "True Lies" is safe, bloated and its comedic elements undermine all tension. It's hard to feel "on the edge of your seat" when everything is played for laughs. The film's CGI heavy final act was a big deal back in the 1990s (an audacious set piece with US Harriers), but today is wholly routine and generates little buzz. The film's best action sequence is perhaps a simple bathroom brawl, inspired by Hong Kong cinema. It would influence a similar brawl in "The Matrix".Comparisons with Spielberg are apt, as both directors began their careers making lean, violent pulp ("Jaws", "Duel", "Terminator", "Aliens") before quickly becoming bloated, preachy, watered-down directors. Cameron would replace the darkness of "Aliens" with the hokey Spielbergian ending of "The Abyss" and fills both "True Lies" and "Terminator 2" with annoying kids. By the time he got to "Titanic" and "Avatar", Cameron would be more comfortable making PG12 films for his now infantilized audience.Upon release "True Lies" was widely bashed for being racist (the bad guys are stereotypical middle eastern terrorists who want to "nuke America!") and sexist (women are only cool if they're stripping or hanging from our hero's arms). Arnie is himself your typical All American Boyscout while the film's "terrorists" are neutered, castrated, sexless, and incompetent. Virtually all action movies play by these rules, hero and audience pumped full of blood and ready to sodomise. As masculinity must be constantly reconstructed, these films play like hilarious representations of male anxieties, and all become camp with time. Today the only cast member who comes off looking good is cult favourite Bill Paxton. Arnie looks good when smashing skulls - he moves like a machine, a bipedal tank chassis - but like a child molester whenever he tries to smile or seem loving and sweet. Creepy.7.9/10 - Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have rarely seen a movie so bloody stereotypical and offensive towards a group of people. How dare they produce something which is composed of nothing but blatant stereotypes on one group of people alone. It is terrible and I don't care that the movie was good besides that fact, because I do not support pathetic stereotypes like this. They made all Arabs look like women beating, anti-American, stupid terrorists that want to end the world. They portrayed Arabs worse in this movie than they portrayed Nazis in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. I have known many Arab Americans and I am sorry, I'm not such a weak minded fool that I'm going to sit through a movie which degrades them like this. The producers showed NO concern whatsoever about who they offend. Fine, they wanna make a movie that offends everybody that isn't as bad because it isn't a "racist" movie. But when they produce a movie that specifically points at Arabs with the finger and makes every other group of people look fine that's called racism. I do NOT think a movie like this is worth anything more than to spit on. Neither are the scriptwriters and the producers.</fullReview>

When Harry's two lives unexpectedly collide, both he and Helen find themselves in the clutches of international terrorists, fighting to save not only their marriage, but their lives.

And that's no lie..."True Lies" is a high class prostitution, but it's still excellent. In the epitome, actors are muscle-bound weightlifters. PG-rated housewives hide X-rated bodies behind R-rated underwear. One of the reasons it works is humor. Ms. Curtis' performance winks sexy. Tom Arnold and Bill Paxton are dependable and broad.

		<fullReview>True Lies (1994) *** (out of 4) Highly entertaining action film about a secret agent (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and terrorists. It's been quite a few years since I last watched this film but it hasn't lost any of its major. Arnold is great in one of his best roles and Tom Arnold really adds terrific support and comedy. Jamie Lee Curtis shows off a nice body as well as some nice comic touches. The action scenes are all terrific but my favorite is probably the battle in the bathroom. The motorcycle/horse scene is another great one. I think the whole subplot with Bill Paxton is terrific and makes for some of the best laughs in the film. Charlton Heston has a fine cameo as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Cameron. What the heck you did.That is very probably one of the worst films that i've had the pleasure to watch. Really, it's not that bad. It's unbelievably bad. I always wonder why Shwarzenegger's career flopped after the Terminator, but that is the answer i was seeking. True Lies. How i wanted this film to be a lie. Just a lie. But i really can't say at all that it wasn't a fun film to watch, because it's laughable, wanting you or not. It's utterly dull, the script itself is razzy worth(lame reference, but is true). Arnie talking to the horse 'What kind of cop are you'. Normally, i would just do a big facepalm, but that scene is so hilarious, with Arnold with the weird accent, that i simply couldn't contain myself. Arnie, in True Lies, did one of the worst acting performances that i've EVER seen, i mean, his acting never was something better than bad, but in this film he just won the cake. Bravo! Too bad for Jamie Lee Curtis, she actually didn't acted that good, pretty average, but her performance was Cannes,globes and Oscars worthy compared to Arnie. James Cameron always did good action scenes, but in this film they were so out of place and exaggerated that it's obviously that he just lose completely the sense or just wanted to make a homage to Brian DePalma, the cheesiest director ever, because that film looks exactly the kind of film that DePalma would do. Senseless and tasteless, with bad acting and totally implausible and over the top situations. Yeah, it really looks like a DePalma film.After that film, all my (little) respect that i had for James Cameron, mostly for Terminator(the first one) and for the average Avatar, his two 'greatest' films, were gone. He just proved that he is a very cheesy and average at best director, like i always suspected. 2.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most uncomfortable movies I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hope that I am not the only one who feels very sorry for the leading actress and who feels very uncomfortable when this movie runs. I did have high hopes expecting to see a breathtaking action flick (something like "Die Hard" or at least "Black Eagle", which is by the way a good movie), but it all ends up in this review.The main female character is humiliated in such perverted, though very "slight" and "charming", ways that I cannot understand how this movie can have any positive comments from female audience. A few sexual talks are disgusting, though again "served" so carefully. If it is not enough, the American crew stuffs everything hated (by the American society, I guess) into this flick and tries really hard to show how good and cool the real American heroes are. The rocket has Russian labels upon it (oh, yes, we are bad guys of course, and we sell weaponry to the terrorists, sure ass). The terrorists are from Asia (of course Asia is full of mindless terrorists and "dirty Arabs"). The main male character is a super-macho who goes through thick and thin just to save the blessed America from the evil forces of the East. How witty and how patriotic! Well, enjoy this fest if you can.The scene in the toilet (the energetic brawl) was not bad concerning choreography and it hooked my attention but everything else was the pits. I suggest they the filmmakers wanted to impress the viewer with the final jet/helicopter scene. I don't know much about helicopters and jets but the scene looked absolutely unnatural to me. And when the American hero solidly put a train of bullets into the skyscraper (well, he missed, so what?), which should mean unnecessary deaths of simple citizens... Oh, I forget, he is saving his family, which is of the highest value in the modern society. Kill off the other families but save your own! It's a wild world after all.Such movies are a disgrace to human race. Women, if you are sane and at least consider yourself human beings, give this flick the rating it really deserves. People from the East, if you respect your own culture, do the same. Sane people on IMDb, treat this kind of cinema-making the way it should be treated.How great "Predator" and "Terminator" once were (to me, still are) and how embarrassing and soulless this is. People step on each other in this one, spit onto each other's feelings, play with each other, act like jerks, and say horrible things. And all this is wrapped up in a bright cover.The antipode of this movie is "Stalker". And I am quite sure that people who enjoy "True Lies" will never like "Stalker". Am I wrong? Prove it, I'll be waiting.Perhaps the men who make such movies are indeed mixing "truth" and "lie". "True Lies" is an American phenomenon of the modern times I guess. But I still think that common American women and men are reasonable persons and can draw the line between "the good", "the bad", and "the ugly". I will remember this movie, while it spoiled one evening of mine, when I sat in front of my TV expecting a cool action flick and got a wreck instead.And if that's not enough, there is one tiny phrase that can be given as an awkward tag-line: "I married Rambo." A similar saying was pronounced by the female character. When a movie makes allusions to another movie in such pathetic verbal ways, it is often a very bad sign. If in "Terminator" some cop would have said "We need Robocop to fight it!" I would have never given "Terminator" even 7 out of 10 on IMDb scale. Because the original atmosphere would have been ruined forever.It reminds me of such ugly and soulless "IMDb top 250" movies like "Clockwork Orange", "Old Boy", and "Fight Club".Hollywood abomination. 1 out of 10 (I cannot put a better mark, sorry). Thanks for attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood at its bloated, indulgent worst.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of a guy with screen presence who nevertheless can't act being the world's biggest star seems almost unthinkable now, but an Austrian shooting everything in sight was all the rage back in the 80s and early 90s.Yet what troubles is not Arnold doing his thing, but the nastier subtexts at play here. Hollywood's reaction towards minorities has always been very black and white from back in the days when the natives of America were portrayed on film as scalping savages. Yet here we get a now-trendy depiction of Islamic fundamentalists, just six years after Rambo helped the Taliban get into power. Although these films are just mindless entertainment, seeing the reflections of US foreign policy through them can be interesting. Art Malik plays a terrorist known as the Sand Spider (hmmmmmm, sound a little like a racial epithet you might know...?) who is sometimes used for comedy purposes, sometimes more sinister ones. At one point we're expected to laugh and cheer as this crazy fundamentalist has his nuts crushed on a plane and is fired off on a missile... yet before that we're shown his villainy as he slaps a woman twice in the face.Ah, the women. Jamie Lee Curtis' big role in this is to do a striptease. Though as she hits and kicks the guy who made her do it, it's okay, right? That's empowerment... take your clothes off for millions, but then kick a man and it's all okay, you didn't sell out. Though as she was previously most famous for getting her boobs out in Trading Places I guess it's a step up. And it's not as if her dad was using the medium of film to actually make worthwhile points, like The Defiant Ones, is it? Oh, wait.Yet the really repellent part of this film comes with the only other prominent female character, Tia Carrere's Juno. There only for the money (in more ways than one) she's the recipient of the previously-mentioned face slaps, a token Asian who doesn't care about anyone and only exists to be the victim of physical abuse, or to be called/referred to as a "bitch" on no less than four occasions. Hollywood of the time had a penchant for violence against women as some kind of obnoxious titillation... in the previous year's underrated Last Action Hero, we saw Arnold's daughter being slapped around, conveniently landing on a close up of her cleavage before indulging in some crotch- kicking ripostes. Similarly, the following year's Godawful Stallone vehicle Judge Dredd saw two women going at it, with a token Asian girl getting bashed around by the righteous white American girl... after trying to kick her in the vagina, of course. Such a mess of sexualised racial-gender violence comes to the fore here, with a scene that has Lee Curtis slash Carrere's face open by deliberately turning her wedding ring inside out to slap her. We're supposed to cheer the nominal heroes, but are we really to cheer a woman mutilating another? Their conflict comes to an end after Curtis repeatedly punches Carrere in the face (who has, for the sake of completion, just done the same) before braining her twice with a wine bottle.Maybe it's taking it all too seriously to suggest that this overblown nonsense is a sexist, ambiguously violent and almost overtly racist propaganda vehicle for a guy who went on to become a Republican Governor. But there's a deeply unpleasant underside to this would-be action comedy, an unpleasant tract in the narrative. As a film it's competently made and stands up quite well as it approaches its twentieth anniversary, only the 80s-throwback soundtrack really dating it. The characters have more meat by the standards of a typical Schwarzenegger movie (which is to say, still next to none at all) though the humour inherent is bland, banal and obvious. Yet it still exists as an ethically questionable piece of work, a $115,000,000 political statement where you can thrill to a woman slashing open another woman's face. Great entertainment for all the family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Towards the big showdown at the construction site, we have a terrorist Salim, who even after having Harry's wife as a hostage, wants to and manages to get Harry's daughter Dana as a hostage. This after he has believed that Harry is dead! It's a very forced attempt by the screenwriter Mr. Cameron to include harry's daughter in the climax, so she can be a part of the climax and the character arc can be completed (Bringing the father and the daughter together).After Mrs. Tasker is given an assignment by Harry to meet her up at the Hotel, terrorists strike and take them hostage. How did they know that Harry was going to be here? There's nothing in the film that suggests that they had either used a tracking device or they were following Harry's every move carefully.With such big plot holes, the whole fun is reduced to zero.But on the other hand, the characterization are unique, especially that of Jamie Lee Curtis. Performances are great. Even a terrible actor like Arnold Schwarzenegger has performed very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie heightens the excitement of the action movie as far as the amazing visuals are concerned. The movie is consistently bright and shiny and has many eye-popping "stunts" and a likable sense of humor. I especially liked Curtis and how she translates the character of a bored housewife to an international terrorist plot. Her striptease scene was hilarious. But True Lies is pretty slight. There's nothing to really get into or to root for. Schwarzenegger is a superman, nothing can touch him emotionally or physically and it disrupts the down to earth human touch that James Cameron tries to bring to the over-the-top spy movie. The plot basically boils down to shooting up brown-skinned people indiscriminately again. I'm not saying the movie is racist but it's a trend I thought that American action movies were over. Tom Arnold, who seems the funniest when he's just spouting off on talk shows, is just there to give lame cutesy one-liners. And I was just counting down the seconds until the daughter gets kidnapped; that's her only purpose in the movie. True Lies is great for the eyes but it just made me hungry for an action film with a real sense of danger. The whole film is fundamentally a "dodging bullets" sort of action movie, a real step down for Cameron after Terminator 2. **1/2 of out ****</fullReview>

Sexual innuendo in film and TV is funny, to a point. This film just takes it, skanks up all the female characters, then lays it on thick and fast. Not what any thinking person calls 'humour'. I can't find anything good about this film. Masquirades as feministic with Jamie-Lee's role in brining down the terrorists, but with the skanky miniskirts, clearly isn't; packed with the worst early-90s stereotypes like screaming-daughter-"oh daddy I love you now but not before lets make up please help me".

The action sequences are pretty dumb and predictable e.g. the gun falling down the stairs and killing all the bad guys. And what was Jamie Lee Curtis thinking? Her role is an embarrassment. The villain is a typical stereotype. His bungling doesn't really make the character a worthy opponent to Arnies virtually invincible secret agent. I was pretty bored watching this movie, it could have done with being cut shorter which would have given a leaner tighter movie. For example Curtis' strip scene could have been dispensed with without any real effect on the narrative and flow of the movie. This is definitely one of Camerons poorer efforts.Mediocre entertainment.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumb And Overlong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many ways TRUE LIES is the last hurrah of Arnold Schwarzenegger and when you stop to consider it's supposed to be one of his best movies it says a lot about the standard of films he's appeared in . The problem I have with Arnie movies is that they're dumb , overlong and over produced ( The original TERMINATOR and TOTAL RECALL not with standing ) and TRUE LIES is no different !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!Let's take a look at the running time . Two and a quarter hours is too long to tell a story of a secret agent stopping a bunch of mad Islamic terrorists detonating a nuclear device in an American city . Did we really need a subplot that features Harry Tasker's wife also being a secret agent ? This subplot is so overwhelming that it takes up the main bulk of the movie halfway through and we're treated to a not very funny sequence of Harry interrogating his wife . Damn romance and get on with killing bad guys say IThe amount of humour also jars with the high body count . Yeah okay I might be missing the point of what makes an entertaining movie but like most movies featuring Ah-nuld there's too much blood shed and too much wise cracks featuring blood shed . Lets see a movie where Arnie's character has to scrape up the remains of bad guys from walls and put them into a body bag after he's blown them away , I wonder if he'll be in a jokey mood doing that ? If I remember correctly there was supposed to be a sequel to TRUE LIES but the current political climate post 9/11 seems to have ruled this out . I can't say I'm unhappy to hear that since I felt somewhat uneasy watching this in the 21st century , Islamic terrorists wanting to nuke an American city - That's not entertainment and when you consider these theocratic scumbags are equipped with weapons that were designed , built and manufactured by communist atheists , something the heroes never think of pointing out , you do realize that this movie suffers from an irony deficency Arnie fans will love this movie though</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the worst film i have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never have i seen something as dumb as this. I usually like Swartzy's films and i accept the low level of reality in them as a rule that applies throughout his opus. I am known to like several films that are even less realistic and in which the only link with the real world is the occasional use of gravity like "Lai Wong (1991)". "True Lies (1994)" is out of "Schwarzenegger's style" and he badly lacks acting skills to brake out of that style so the whole feeling of the movie is like watching John Cleese in a film that is not funny, or like Leslie Nilsen in his black&amp;white-Canadian-Mountie roles as opposed to his later works with Mel Brooks.There is no need to go into details that make this film stupid like lack of any aviation knowledge on the behalf of writer and director and particularly absolutely no idea of how the R-R Pegasus engine works. If i was to list all the bad stuff in this movie i would end up retyping it's script.My advice for all Schwarzenegger fans is to see it because if you like him that much you will have no trouble to forgive him this blunder and also, knowing how bad this is, you will appreciate his other films more. To all others i suggest that you check your IQ and if it has a value below zero than you should see it, and if your IQ is higher than zero than you shouldn't. Beware: Spoiler ahead! However some satisfaction could be found in one scene where Jamie Lee Curtis is in her underwear and the fact that she wears short skirts and dresses throughout the whole movie and she does have a pair of fine legs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From director James Cameron (Aliens, Terminators 1 + 2, Titanic) this is a great action comedy film. Basically Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a secret spy when he is away from his wife Helen (Golden Globe winning Jamie Lee Curtis) and teenage daughter, Dana (Wrong Turn's Eliza Dushku), with best friend and co-worker Albert Gibson (a great Tom Arnold) and a boring computer salesman to them. Soon enough though, his two lives are going to be brought together when after trying to secretly rekindle his love life, Harry with Helen are kidnapped by terrorists planning to blow up large cities in the US, lead by Salim Abu Aziz (Holby City's Art Malik), along with his accomplice Juno Skinner (Tia Carrere). With Helen now knowing the truth, Harry is now determined to stop the terrorists from exploding the warheads, and rescue his family at the same time. Also starring Bill Paxton as Simon and Charlton Heston as Spencer Trilby. The action and chase sequences are gripping, and the giggles in amongst are great too. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Effects. Arnold Schwarzenegger was number 54 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Jamie Lee Curtis was number 52 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and her sexy (bra and knickers) dance in the film was number 31 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Security Alert ! ......to your I.Q level....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, the good old USA is saved once more by a computer sales rep who in the essence is a special agent working for the government! How lucky the Americans are ! How prideful they should feel! As humble movie fans, we, on the other hand, should at least pay tribute and show our gratitude to our Folly-hood masters for creating this sublime genetic marvel, called Arnold Schwarznegger.Now a special agent who is working on top secret cases involving security threats to uncle Sam, can so easily use his agency's covert resources to exact a revenge on her wife's alleged boyfriend, even blackmail her into acting as a call girl to save her marriage. But, then what we see? Just as Arnie was about to give her a lesson about matrimonial loyalty, the hotel room is raided by terrorists of crimson jihad headed by an Arab named Aziz. How come jihadists got wind of the top secret location of the hotel room in which Arnie played cat-and-mouse game with his wife? You naughty boy, if you play with agency's covert resources, they risk to become "overt", then the baddies (now Arabs, previously Russians) get you.As for Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis), it would have been much better if she had kept herself for Halloween type of genre rather than posing first, as a naive housewife, then a bored lady looking for a bit of excitement with lemon (2nd hand car) sellers, then a transient agent forced into seduction, then later a real all-American brave woman under captivity. By the way, though it is matter of taste, J.L Curtis has been a turn-off for me in terms of sex appeal and a real disappointment when she attempts to go sexy. A horse (mare) would have been a better choice as Arnie's lady partner. On the other hand, credit must be given when credit is due: her acrobatic skills on the chopper are impressive and she should take advantage of that by accepting offers from any Chinese circus. Speaking of acrobatics, I wonder how come so many people manage to control their movement on the slippery surface of a flying helicopter or a jet fighter without falling off and behave as relaxed as children in the playground. Anyway, let's not rub it in. After all, haven't we learned that in Follyhood movies everything is possible?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding performance !!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is really amazing movie of all time, Arnold didn't received the Oscar for this, that I really didn't liked. I don't know how Oscars are selected....??? the movie for Oscar was selected once called CHICAGO, I think this movie is the worst of all. If they keep on selecting this kind of movies then they have to close the Oscars in the future. Truelies should have got Oscar for best picture. It shows how Arnold saves her wife and Daughter from the terrorists, instead he traps himself in the game. the performance is fantastic and special effects are awful, I have watched 4 times in the cinema. James Cameron is really hard core director who didn't received Oscar for this movie.</fullReview>
