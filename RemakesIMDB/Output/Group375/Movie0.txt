		<shortDescription>It obviously touched a nerve</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading previous commentary, I'm amused by the violent reaction this movie still elicits. The ranting of previous reviewers indicates the movie touched a nerve. I have seen really, really bad movies and Red Dawn is certainly not as bad as the ratings it has received here.As is so often the case, many previous reviewers are criticizing the film because its premise conflicts with their political philosophy. I wonder how they would have rated this film had the characters been teen-aged members of an all-black football team who become partisans fighting bigoted southern whites in a 1960s civil war that never occurred. Would they be so harsh if the movie were about a group of teenage Jewish soccer team members fighting the Nazis in World War II? they might not have rated it nine or 10 stars but I'd bet they would have given it more than one star. Given the current political climate, they might even receive it more warmly if the characters were Iraqi teenagers fighting Americans.I understand the temptation to judge movies based on your own preferences rather than the movie's own merits. I recently watched Easy Rider for the first time and absolutely could have kicked myself for wasting the two hours or so it took the silly drivel to play out. Were I to rate it strictly on the way I felt about the movie -- the silly situations at the commune where 50 hippies are supposed to live all winter on about a half acre of wheat, about enough to produce a loaf of bread, the laborious acid dropping scene, the cartoonishly villainous red necks, the lame acting (other than Nicholson) -- I guess I'd have to give it about a one-star rating. But it was a beautifully filmed movie and it obviously spoke to people at that time. So a more valid assessment from my perspective would be that it's an anachronism that seems a bit silly today but obviously had merit in context.I believe Red Dawn touched something in young people of the mid-80s in the same way Easy Rider touched young people in the late 60s. Sift through the silliness of both movies and you find something people were looking for. Prior to this movie, young people were told that if World War III came, they would either be swallowed by an irresistible communist onslaught or fried in a matter of seconds by a nuclear explosion. Red Dawn said to them, "If the time comes, you will not be helpless. You will fight back and win." It was an entirely unique message at the time and one people were longing to hear. In fact, The United States was already fighting back and won it's greatest victory over its most formidable foe without direct armed conflict and bloodshed because of visionary and resolute political leadership.From the time of its release until today, Red Dawn has been roundly criticized for the implausibility of the plot. It's quite true that the communist bloc was not capable of a successful invasion of the United States in 1984. But for those who failed to grasp this, Red Dawn was not a documentary. The prologue establishes the circumstances under which the invasion occurred and the action that proceeds from that premise is possible. Would communist troops shoot up a school? Their battle record indicates that if they saw it as or mistook it for a tactical objective, they most certainly would. Would they shoot civilians? Is there anybody out there so ignorant to suggest they wouldn't?Good Points about Red Dawn: *The action sequences are well done and look realistic. For instance, there's a scene where a plane drops a bomb. You see the fireball first and then hear the sounds. That's a nice, realistic touch. *The actors handle their weapons properly *Beautiful photography *There's some good chemistry between some of the actors *The outcome is typical of what happens in partisan fighting. Partisans typically enjoy initial success because of surprise and knowledge of the terrain. But they usually eventually succumb to better-trained, better-equipped troops *I liked the musical scoreBad points about Red Dawn: *The communists are a tad too stupid for too long *The use of horses is a stretch. *Some of the teenage high-fiving and exuberance will make you groan *Some (but not all) of the dialog and acting is awfully stiffIn short, it's an action picture that will entertain people who like action pictures. It has a unique plot line that has now become an anachronism. At it takes a jab at one of Hollywood's scared cows, communism which is refreshing. Nobody should be ashamed of making it, acting in it or enjoying watching it.Politically, the real question is not why Hollywood made a film like Red Dawn. It is rather, why did 50 years of totalitarian communist oppression spawn so few films critical of communism? Why are there seemingly scores of movies about McCarthyism and none about the Soviet gulag system? Schindler's List shows that Hollywood can make an incredible film, a film so compelling you can't take your eyes off of it, about something so horrible you can hardly bear to think about it. Stalin's body count exceeds Hitler's yet there is no Schindler's List for the Gulag. And that is something to be ashamed of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Only A Movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when I was in college in Colorado Springs, Colorado when it came out in 1984. Many people dismiss this movie at best as either a teen fantasy or at worse as a right-wing maniac's delusional vision of the future. Yes, it is a teen movie, but there's a bit more to it than that. I'm basically writing this for those of you who either weren't born or too young to remember those days. I grew up in the aftermath of the Vietnam War. Anything mildly patriotic was regarded in bad taste. So when John Millius and his friends decided to make this patriotic teen movie about resistance fighters fighting invaders from the Evil Empire, he was just tapping into the frustration that many people (including myself) felt at that time. The scene I remember most vividly is the one when Patrick Swazye shoots the young Russian political officer in the Chevy Blazer. The audience consisted mostly of guys from nearby Fort Collins and Peterson AFB, and they gave this scene a standing ovation. In this post 11 September world, it's hard to imagine a time when, during the Cold War, flying the flag or loving your native land made many people think you were either a Nazi or a member of the John Birch Society. Now this film isn't "Seven Days in May" or "Fail-Safe." It's just a movie that was made at a time after we had lost a war and many in the world regarded the USA as a paper tiger. That's all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wayne missed the point.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Previous commenter Wayne missed the point... "Red Dawn" does not glorify violence and war. Far from it... the movie tries to show just how gruesome and de-humanizing an extended conflict like this can be. The occupying Soviet and Cuban/Nicaraguan soldiers are not portrayed as monsters. In fact, there are many moments when they are shown for exactly what they are... often young and frequently scared soldiers, doing the job they have been told to do. There are certain individual characters that are shown as ruthless killers, but they are generally the exception. The movie is less an action film, and more a cautionary tale of taking things too far and going over a precipice from which it is not easy to return. Neitzsche said "Those that do battle with monsters should take care, lest monsters they become." The Wolverines start out as a band of scared kids running for their lives, and grow into guerilla fighters forced to fight for their freedom. Eventually, they take it too far, and start to lose their emotional connection to what they are doing. It's hard to say more without giving away some key points of the ending sequences, but suffice to say that the kids come perilously close to fulfilling Neitzsche's warning. Those that take this movie simply at face value will lose a lot of the potential impact, and will likely miss the messages contained therein.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a Russian American I found myself switching allegiances during this movie. I must say I loved this flick. I've always been fascinated with the cold war, and the what if scenarios. If you can relate, then this movie is a must see. I thought this movie showed a very strong human side to the realities of a partisan's life, and I believe it was fair. It wasn't an American Rambo, where one man takes down a whole Soviet battalion. No it was a powerful story of what people must conform to in order to deal with the outcome of invasion of ones motherland, and how people, the ordinary person deals with this reality and how they're transformed by it. The United States has never been invaded, and I found this film to be a great prediction of how if an invasion ever took place the American people would fight to the bitter end if they had to. In a way these partisans reminded me of the Soviet partisans of WW2, and how they fought on. This is a great movie which is not overdone, but is very realistic, and fair. The acting is not brilliant, but is good, and the whole movie works. I absolutely loved it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone else before me wrote that a lot of people don't understand how believable this movie was in it's day. I have to agree with the author. I remember this movie as being pretty scary and pretty violent. I haven't seen it in a while but there's a lot of scenes that haunt me. One in particular is when several of the kids look for their parents at a concentration camp. Harry Dean Stanton gives a powerful performance that serves to show that he's a genuine actor. That scene is heartbreaking, as well as a scene that follows with Patrick Swayze breaking down in the snow covered woods. C. Thomas Howell vs. the helicopter. The ritual of the deer blood. Powers Boothe. The final battle and resolution. Yeah, it's a little much and these days, it wouldn't exactly fly but dammit Jim, I dug it at the time and I still do. I think everyone should see it, just so you can either remember or learn what it was like to live in a time when the general thinking was a little paranoid. I think the movie manages to capture at least that, being what it is, a paranoid fantasy of someone who probably has a huge gun collection in his concrete reinforced cellar. Rating: *** out of *****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tribute to the paranoia of the far right in the 1980's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this "movie" on TV a few times (although it would be better described as propaganda) and have to honestly say that there are so many problems with it's basic premise and message that it stands more as a tribute to the paranoia of the far right in the early 1980's than anything else.Just starting with the basic premise of how the events that lead to what happens in the movie is so out there and nonsensical that it beggars belief.Here a just a few examples of how ridiculous this movie is: The Russians achieve their initial invasion by commandeering thousands of commercial jets and flying then into US airspace.Okay, the problem with this is that even though the FAA and air traffic controllers are rather overworked but I'd still think that someone somewhere working in an air traffic control tower would notice SEVERAL THOUSAND UNSCHEDULED AIRCRAFT JUST SUDDENLY APPEARING OUT OF NOWHERE."West Germany elects the greens to power and they demand that all nuclear weapons be removed from European soil which leads N.A.T.O dissolves and leaves America to "stand alone" with only Britain at it's side".Aside from this being little more than a cheap dig at the peace and anti-nuclear weapons movements that were gaining influence at that time there is no way short of those other countries being nuked into oblivion that that would happen."Russian forces invaded Alaska and came down through Canada" And no one in Alaska or Canada noticed thousands of Russian troops and pieces of equipment rolling through the streets and thought to notify the Canadian or American government to tell them the Russians were coming.Lastly that a meat headed high school football quarterback who's only previous experience in a leadership role of any kind is being a high school football team quarterback and goes hunting with dad somehow qualifies him with advanced knowledge of military maneuvers and tactics especially considering the fact that he and his "Wolverines" going up against SPEZNAZ Troopers who are the elite forces of the Russian Army (although in this movie they are depicted as being bumbling fools who can't hit the broadside of a barn with a machine gun)and can organize to engage them in battle and win.Those are just some of the biggest implausibilities in this movie.Not to mention the fact that the overall message of this movie is that it's fun to watch teenagers kill people as long as they're big bad commies one character even says without an ounce of remorse when asked what it felt like to murder in cold blood a drunken Russian soldier who was unarmed and he say's "it felt good".Director John Milius has admitted that he wrote this pathetic exercise in jingoism in response to the 1983 TV movie The Day After (which was a far superior film about the aftermath of nuclear war on a small Kansas town and the people living there)because he was angered by the way war and the aftermath of a nuclear attack was presented in a negative light and he felt that it was "just a hippie peacenik movie designed to unfairly influence the youth of America away from liking war and towards both peace and nuclear disarmament".This movie is little more than cheap far right propaganda designed to feed the paranoia of the far right and a chance to feed their lust for blood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>InbRed Dawn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some weeks ago, I got to see the notorious 1984 film 'Red Dawn' on TV. I had been looking forward to the experience since i played a certain computer game with a similar plot some years back. There was something exotic and fascinating with the thought of a very unlikely Soviet invasion of the USA. Disappointingly, what I saw was pretty trashy.In the movie, America has been deserted by many former allied because of an extremely unlikely dissolvement of NATO (except of the UK, of course). As if that wasn't enough, Mexico has underwent a Revolution to become a Marxist state. In 1984, the Soviets got unlucky with their harvest, which leads to the invasion of the US. Naturally. According to an Air Force officer the heroes in the movie encounter later, they smuggled in special troops (Spetsnaz) using charter planes, to secure key strategic points. He adds: 'the same way they did in Afghanistan'. Interestingly, that's the first time I've heard of charter routes to that specific country. Spies had somehow crippled the American ability to defend and retaliate, and a lot of horrifying commies from Latin America swarmed across the border. The Soviets showed up with massive armies, who were somewhat stopped by the armed defenders. Is there still hope? Of course! Because 1: The American youth are professional guerrilla warriors, and 2: The Soviets don't have a clue how to occupy a country (as seen in Afghanistan). The youth call themselves 'The Wolverines', and kill LOADS of occupants using captured equipment.The script is maybe the most disturbing aspect of this film: It has dumb clichés, witless dialog, and is far, far from being intellectual/contemplative. On the question of how it felt to kill a foe, a youth who had lost his parents answer: 'It felt good'. This particular actor was especially horrendous, so that you almost laugh out loud when he says it.The special effects are cheap and uncomfortable to look at, which strengthens the feeling that this is a low-budget film. I hoped for lots of tanks, massive air strikes etc., but the movie contains a minimum of cool combat sequences. The attack choppers late in the movie doesn't even look like the infamous Soviet Hinds, they're just crappy look-a-likes.The acting was bad. Seriously, it was BAD. I understand completely why Patrick Swayze had his breakthrough in a later movie, and not in this one. Charlie Sheen, who plays his brother is awful as well. The supporting cast sometimes seem like a group of randomly selected amateurs. The actors have serious problems displaying their characters. Emotions seem fake. I'm surprised those morons weren't nailed at the Razzie awards that year.The director of this crap is John Milius. He also participated in the creation of the script. For these imbecilic escapades, I suspect his family of being badly inbred. I mean he must have intellectual issues when he makes a bomb like this. When he made this film, he obviously had no clue how to make a movie entertaining for people with adequate intelligence.The controversy around this film was caused by its political message. It was by many labeled as propaganda, and that's what the movie is remembered for. However, what will make me remember it, is the poor quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Far Off Gone' is right on with that summary.As a teen when this movie came out, us kids had grown up with Cold War news every night on TV. All these ICBMs being made, the 'Star Wars' defense initiative (SDI), even movies like 'War Games' contributed to a overall climate of concern about Russian/USA relations.Then this movie hit theaters and us teens and younger adults felt we weren't so powerless after all. I can only speak for myself, but the opening scene was very sobering to a 18 year old kid who could relate to the dumbfounded kids in the classroom watching Soviet paratroopers hitting the schoolyard. I guess its one of those things where you had to be at the age and grown up in that era to really understand how the movie was received for its time.The cast is chock full of stars in their younger years, and acting isn't bad either. Great movie and certainly worth watching at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking over previous reviews it's obvious that this film has generated a large degree of debate. Most people argue that your view of the film will be tainted by your political philosophy (are you a red-blooded American who would give your life to defend the values of your country, or a cowardly tree hugger in denial about the imminent Cubo-Russian assault?)Well, as neither of those (Cubans and Russians teaming up to invade a hick town is completely believable, yeah?), I hope to be able to give a somewhat balanced review of the film, and the fact is, it is terrible.The main problem with the film is that it just seems like a bunch of scenes thrown together rather than sequence of events leading to a climax and resolution. There is almost no characterisation apart from a few throwaway lines near the start of the movie, and the action starts about 1 minute in to the movie. If alarm bells are ringing, good. It's really hard to care about what happens to someone when you haven't even caught their name. Compounding this problem is the woeful acting - the acting is often so wooden I caught myself laughing out loud several times.And as previously mentioned, there is no context to the majority of the movie. It's just a lot of scenes of our heroes killing commies in the woods / attacking enemy bases. This is what absolutely killed it for me - most of the time you don't know who they are attacking, what purpose it serves, what they are trying to achieve, what the desired outcome is etc etc. This makes it mind numbing to watch - it's almost like watching stock footage of a war where you don't know which side is which. I understand that this might be the situation they are placed in, where they don't know how long they will be fighting for and so on, but it certainly does not make for good cinema when you have no reason to care about the outcome of the battles they engage in. I guess what I'm saying is that there's no progression throughout the movie - it would be entirely feasible to cut and paste 80% of the movie into a different order and it would have no bearing whatsoever on the plot.Perhaps the most ironic part of the movie is that the only person to show mercy is one of the Communists. It hardly makes you feel for the "Good Guys" when they kill people in cold blood throughout the movie yet the "Bad Guy" is the only one big enough to let a wounded enemy walk away. Actually that's not true, the most ironic part of the movie would have to be the moustaches which all the commies have, but that's another story....I guess the one thing that saves it for me is that not all of our "heroes" live - it would have received one star had it been a complete feel good walkover, and it's a measure of restraint which the movie could have used a lot more of.So, if you're a red blooded American whose eyes brim with tears every time you hear your national anthem then by all means see this movie as you'll probably enjoy it. That doesn't mean it's a good movie though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confessions of a Socialist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all; this movie is a bore. Normally you're around 20 minutes into a movie before the main plot starts. screen writers use this time to establish the main characters, their way of life, what they are like etcetera... this movie starts right after the credits with the invasion and it doesn't stop till the end (the movies lasts for 2 hours!!!). Maybe this sounds awesome now, but unfortunately it's nothing else then one cliché action scene arbitrarily added on the next. The only remotely thrilling scene is the one where the kids hide from a soviet patrol behind some rocks and get caught. And could somebody tell me how the kids were able to mutate into rebel soldiers?Just by playing in the woods? There's one more thing that I can't ignore regarding the other reviews: the politics of the movie. So please allow me one question: RD is about a high school football team fighting off the soviet invasion, right? Am I a communist because I think that's stupid???? Some said Red Dawn wouldn't dehumanize the Russians. Doesn't the movie start with soviet soldiers shooting young high school students? (I have to add; these students were actually unarmed, unlike these days). Isn't that at least a little one-sided? Did somebody really need a propaganda flick like this to feel good about themselves again? But hey, that's just me and I'm a European wimp, a godless socialist, a Robert Redforf fan and whatever else comes to your mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just because it's propaganda, doesn't mean it's bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who has seen Leni Riefenstahl's "Triumph Des Willens" (Triumph of the Will), the documentary about the Nuremburg Rallies, understands that even the vilest propaganda can attain the status of great art. Without a doubt, Nazism was a force to be despised and resisted, yet "Triumph" remains a fascinating, even great film.That said, I will not put "Red Dawn" on the same plane as Riefenstahl's work. It is neither as good a film nor as vile propaganda. But it does underscore a point I see running through many of the criticisms of "Red Dawn" that have been posted here. Many of the movie's detractors reject the film out of hand because of its undeniably conservative overtones. This, I believe, is lazy criticism. The movie has an excellent pedigree. I suggest you search on ImDb under John Milius' name to see what other films he has been involved in. Some of his more notable accomplishments include the screenplays of "Jeremiah Johnson" and co-authoring "Apocalypse Now", as well as the notably UNconservative adaptation of "Clear and Present Danger". Basil Poledouris' score is fantastic, with its Copland-esque homages. The touches of authenticity in the film are also admirable, including the indoctrination camp (see the recently published "Gulag" or Koestler's "Darkness at Noon")and "Radio Free America" scenes, not to mention the efforts the filmmakers went to to make the military hardware look Russian (as opposed to Russians flying American aircraft in dismal movies like "Iron Eagle II" and "Rambo"). Yes, Red Dawn is propaganda, but just because it may be, from your perspective, the wrong kind of propaganda, you are not justified in invalidating the whole enterprise. It is slick, well-made, and memorable.</fullReview>

The plot is insane, acting over-the-top, but the historical commentary is amazing. People actually believed that such a thing as this was possible in the mid-80s, pre-Gorbachev. This is not "low-level propaganda," its the most obvious pro-American movie I have EVER seen.On the movie alone, the "film" shouldn't even rate.

Wait, a major world superpower forcibly invading a sovereign country with the intention of installing it's own style of government? Throw in the references to the Soviet's despicable invasion of Afghanistan (Its the 80's remember) and this movie is perfect for anyone who can enjoy a big, yummy, spoonful of socratic irony.Even if you can suspend disbelief to the point where it's plausible that a handful of untrained teenagers can massacre scores of elite paratroopers the movie will still force-feed you clichés until you feel physically ill.The invading Soviets enjoy nothing more than wholesale destruction, not to mention killing and/or raping just about every American they can find, while the stoic young resistance fighters variously avenge their parents or 'become men' in a yawn inspiring fashion.All in all this is a film for those who just want to laugh at what filmmakers used to get away with or Patrick Swayze's attempts to be a brooding, manly leader.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I cant honestly say this movie evoked any sort of political argument or emotive response from myself, unlike a lot of some of the reviewers on here (in fact a few seem to have taken the film or its reviews as a personal affront!). The film was an entertaining, nostalgic and highly commercial action movie from a time past.....and on a base level I just plain enjoyed it. It made me smile! The trailer reminded me of a video game called Freedom Fighters (set in New York, you play the part of a plumber leading a resistance force against a Russian invasion) which I had enjoyed too, i liked the premise, so my flatmates and I (2 English, 1 Irish and 1 American) sat through the movie last night. Once the giggles from the girls had subsided (yes Swayze and Sheen look like babies and have not aged too well!) the opening parachute invasion got quite a buzz. Handled clumsily and probably with an extremely limited budget it took a good 20 minutes for the B-movie ethic to settle in, but once over that the premise really started to work, and you could actually begin to empathise with the kids in their situation. The story became a bit strung out in places, the action was cardboardy and basic and the acting was...well....not there really, but I don't think that was down to a lack of talent. But it hung together, and we all enjoyed it. Where peoples readings of political messages come from I have no idea. I understand that America has it's extremists who hide in the mountains, stash mountains of weapons and food for just such an event, but the movie certainly doesn't satirise them. The joke in the film of the NRA bumper sticker and the dead guys "cold, dead hand" falls flat if it was intended as a purposeful message and therefore seems more to be an attempt at acknowledging the certain irony of such events in the states. The rhetoric of the kids in their internal arguments is hollow and situational, not political, and just about manage to hold some water. The movie is and was just a great "what if.....?" and an amusing 80's Hollywood schtick action movie, no more, no less. If a backstory of a continued Cold War was introduced I can well see this being ripe for a remake, and perhaps then you can apply your knee-jerk reactionary theories to it with more basis then...who know?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was quite possibly the stupidest movie I have ever seen. Some how, the soviets have managed to evade Europe, the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, nuclear weapons, the combined armed forces of the US, NATO, and managed to invade the US, with the - sit down for this - help of Cuba. I don't know if coke made its debut in Hollywood around this time,or if John Milius had mental complications, but there is just no plausible excuse for this movie- it is absolutely dreadful. A group of teens are ruggedly morphed into righteous insurgent fighters, fighting to save America from some amalgam of Latinos and a soviet army somehow gifted with obvious teleportation abilities. American teens prevail in the end against the entire soviet army, who have popped into existence in the heart of middle America, by means known only to John Milius. I know we all have to start somewhere, and Milius was probably a little hormone crazed from eating raw dead animals in the tradition of any good American conservative, but, come on now! The only person I can think of that would have loved this movie is Ted Nugent who's grasp on reality has always been tenuous at best. The people who seem to have loved this movie, most of whom are now right wing Republicans, probably saw this movie as a boys wet dream of being an action hero and saving his country. And yet Milius went on to be a screen writer for the movie apocalypse now. Go figure. Reading other user comments this movie seemed to appeal to people imbued with a sense of unreality,people decrying the intrinsic Communism of Hollywood while most of the reviews coming from outside the US almost universally condemn this movie as being idiotic at best. Watch this movie again if you can sit through it, it will give you an idea of the mindset,( and I use the term loosely) of the right wing in the US.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Red Dawn??? False Dawn more like....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like watching movies and love to write good reviews of movies and Red Dawn was a film that I had missed in its original release back in the 80s. I was looking forward to seeing it. I would have been 14 at the time of release and maybe it would have hit a more resonant nerve if I had seen it at that age - but now it is simply dreadful.In 1983 - The Outsiders - directed by Coppola starred Howell, Swayze and Dalton. It is a fantastic film, a great story, good acting and superb directing. The next year - 1984 - all three combine again in Red Dawn to abysmal results. What happened? The cast for Red Dawn was a good one - Charlie Sheen, Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey adding more youth and Powers Boothe and Harry Dean Stanton providing some experience. But Milius' handling of the script, dialogue, action scenes, sound, everything is terrible.A quick summary of the film's premise is this - soviet troops invade America at the start of WW3. A few teenagers escape to the mountains and wage a guerrilla style attack on the forces over a number of months.What is wrong with this movie?1. The characters. No time is given to their background before the attack starts. And they are so cardboard that they do not even come close to discussing the situation they find themselves in - they simply accept it. Their whole lives change in the blink of an eye and they act as if they are ordering Pepsi because there is no Coke left. 2. The acting. If the characters were poorly developed - the acting was embarrassing. Howell lost all he had gained from The Outsiders within 2 minutes of being on-screen. I blame Milius for this as Howell was great in Outsiders and subsequently great in The Hitcher. In between those films Howell lost out on the Marty McFly part in BTTF and subsequently - lost the franchise to being a very successful actor. All Milius' fault? Maybe not - but seeing as Lea Thompson was in BTTF and in this too - Howell must feel aggrieved. Stanton's 'Avenge me' scene is toe-curdling bad.3. The action scenes. Repetitive scenes of our unknown cast of Brat-Packers wandering around the Rockies blasting everything with a red star. The scenes are slow, tedious and downright boring after the umpteenth scenario. The scandal here is that you can see the amount of money spent on explosions / tanks etc. is quite a lot - but there is zero tension in the build up to these. It is like watching a series of unrelated incidents carried out by a bunch of different people every time. You cannot even make out who is doing what. 4. The Dialogue. The amount of times dreadful lines are delivered by incompetent actors is astounding. Did anyone even read this script beforehand? Sometimes, I thought the editing room was having a laugh - for in some scenes it looks like the kids are not even fully ready for the upcoming scene. Their delivery is abysmal but in truth the words that were on the paper, embarrassingly bad. Boothe's death scene is especially bad. As he is shot through the back and hanging from the turret of a soviet tank - he has to deliver his last words to the kids "Shoot straight. For a change." Then he dies. My God, I'd say he was delighted that day to finally get off home with his cheque. Not one to show his grandkids that's for sure.5. The Camera-work. Bar the set-up introductory shots for the changing of the seasons - which consisted of 2 or 3 shots of the Rockies during December, January etc. - the cinematography was downright shoddy. Everything seemed too far away. The camera was too far from the actors to hear what they were saying (the sound obviously re-dubbed on a sound stage afterwards) and to see emotion in their faces. If the audience is not close enough to the actors to feel their emotions - then we cannot identify with them. The whole thing looked like watching a football match from the very highest seat in the stadium.6. The Music. Overbearing, intrusive and dominating every scene it is involved with by beating it down so hard - your ears start to bleed.7. The Plot. The overall premise is not bad but the execution of it terrible. The soviets must have been thick as planks for we learn during the movie that they are on high lookout for our teenage gang - yet they can walk freely among the town, among the soldiers as if they were invisible. Remember, this is a small hick town - not New York - they should be noticed. Where did the Wolerines get all the ammo, guns, RPGs, Claymores, machine guns for their attacks? Okay they got some supplies from Howell's father's shop - a very convenient gun/grocery/camping shop - but do they sell Claymores? I don't think so. It's also hard to swallow the fact that a well organised machine like the Russian army will succumb to a bunch of kids running around the mountains - it just does not ring true. Howell's last stand against the Russian helicopters beggars belief. He is so careful all through the movie not to expose himself but yet decides out of the blue to stand in the open and fire a tiddlywink gun at 2 Russian attack choppers - only to get killed. Why? Too much stuff here to mention but take it on faith that it was bad.All in all a really bad film made by a terrible director. 2/10 - Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More complex than the naysayers would have you believe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor Spoilers Included: This movie seems to irritate certain groups of people, normally those who actually felt there wasn't much difference between the Soviet Union and the United States. Those folks were very vocal back in the seventies and eighties, advocated a "nuclear freeze" and "U.S. out of everywhere" type policies, opposed any sort of defense. So its not much of a surprise that they would dislike a movie that obviously heralded American values, traditions, and clearly warned against weakness in the face of enemies. Yet the move doesn't gloss over a great deal, in places its quite brutal and its hardly a glorification of violence. In one of the more interesting scenes a Russian soldier, young, funny, wants to have his picture taken. Minutes later, he's desperately crawling up hill as he fearfully cries out that "Help, they're killing me!" as Americans with guns are clumsily trying to shoot him. It's actually quite a disturbing scene. In another, the partisans, high school students mostly, end up executing both a helpless Russian soldier and an American turncoat. Though I thought that the fighting between an American resistance and heavily armed Russian Army wasn't particularly well done, the basic idea was sound. In fact, I think it might be interesting to watch this movie after watching "The Beast" with George Dzundza, the only movie I can think of that portrays the guerilla war in Afganistan in the eighties. Both the guerilla fighers, many young and poorly trained, of Afganistan and Vietnam should instruct those who think a lightly armed American resistance couldn't give a mechanized, brutal Red Army fits. Maybe they ought to look into Chechnya as well. I find the movie to be a bit more complex than those who simplistically assign it to the jingoistic flag waving bin; rather I think it is more a warning to Americans to avoid taking liberties for granted, that we are not immune from the dangers lurking in the world, and that there are those who wish us ill, and that martial virtues should not be so easily dismissed.Its rather unsettling to watch American citizens machine gunned by a foreign tank in a small western town, but it happens in this movie. And suffice it to say that the story hardly has a very happy ending.I'd suggest this to anyone who has an interest in understanding the Cold War, particularly as it developed in the Eighties to its successful conclusion under the basic ideas advocated by this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Milius released "Red Dawn" in 1984. Dan Bradley remade the film in 2012. Both films find a gang of photogenic young Americans fighting a guerrilla war against foreign invaders (Soviet Russia in the original film, North Korea in the remake).Milius was a notorious right winger, conservative and gun advocate, so there was some kind of honesty propelling his project. It was racist, xenophobic, dumb, militaristic, alarmist, violently nationalistic, but it felt personal, dammit. A self-described "rugged individualist", Milius' "Dawn" was also a nutty attack on "big government". His well armed guerrillas weren't only protecting Uncle Sam from "dirty communists", "insurgents" and "evil foreign invaders", but protecting their home-towns from an expanding state which sought to "take away our freedoms, man!" And though Milius' heroes were defending a town called Calumet (literally "peace", ie "fighting for peace"), Milius also hinted that America was itself irrevocably corrupt and might not even be worth saving. And so he salivated instead over a kind of nihilistic, glorified version of warfare, where death, battle and survivalists are exalted and those who don't stand up and fend for themselves are weak, pu*****, and so deserve to be crushed.Yeah, it's stupid, but it felt like art. Bradley's "Red Dawn", in contrast, oozed boardroom meetings, plastic visuals and decision committees. The film was so cynical, it changed the nationality of its invading army from Chinese to North Koreans mid production. Why? Purely for box office reasons. With the North Korean market cut off and potential Chinese market's vast, MGM executives promptly ordered the film's "enemy race" changed. And so "Red Dawn" bent to the will of the almighty dollar. Seduced by the Chinese cash cow, it then spent many months in post-production, MGM lackeys digitally altering flags, sets, national symbols and dubbing over Chinese dialogue with Korean. No harm done. Right? After all, Asians do all look the same.Both films offer few thrills, but Bradley's was the more pointless of the two, having been released in the wake of "Tomorrow, When the War Began", another "Red Dawn" remake which likewise demonized Asians and portrayed them as invading menaces. Both films express very western anxieties, pander to western fear mongers, and stir up very specific resentments; China's economy is gathering momentum and so, it is perceived, steps must be taken to both attack it and forestall the collapse of the US Empire.Of course the notion that the United States is being "threatened" and "is at risk of a North Korean or Chinese invasion", is nonsense, just as the idea of a "communist invasion" was nonsense in Milius' era. Indeed, from the 1940s onwards, the truth was virtually the opposite, the US systematically invading or annihilating left leaning, communist or socialistic movements across the globe. Today the US has China surrounded, has 60 percent of its Navy stationed in the region, and wages proxy wars with it across Africa and South America. China may be a "threat" to the US in the far future, but as of now there is no force in the world that can match the US Empire, an Empire which has over 700 military bases in foreign countries around the world, a multi zillion dollar military budget (which dwarfs the combined economies of entire continents), possesses state-of-the-art military hardware and has its own proxy armies embedded in most of the world's hot-spots. And of course, far from being at risk of invasion, the US spends much of its time invading foreign nations, be it secretly or blatantly. The irony is, what finally crushes the American Empire - history teaches us that all Empires shrink back down to impotent pinpricks - will most likely not be foreign invasion but perhaps exactly what tended to crush previous Empires: over-expansion, mounting debts and inflation.There are slight differences between "Great" Empires of the past, though, and the US Empire. Past empires were extractive. They succeeded because the value of the resources and wealth extracted from conquered lands exceeded the value of conquest and governance. Rome failed because Romans exhausted manpower and resources fighting civil wars and amongst themselves. The British Empire for similar reasons. Americans, meanwhile, get few extractive benefits from war. Iraq hit the US public with trillion dollar debts and no Iraqi oil, likewise the struggle against the Taliban in Afghanistan. So where's the money going? Not to Washington, not to the US state as an extractive organism, but to the benefit of a few powerful interest groups; parasitic cartels embedded within and beyond the state. Under such a structure, conquest therefore stops being the aim ? the US did not conquer Iraq and has been forced out politically by the government that Washington established ? because success at war no longer matters. Rather, extraction now takes place by being at war, and the victor nation is as much a victim, taxpayer money slowly suckled. The goal is no longer to extract from the enemy, but to strip American wealth and "liberty" as well. This is why the wars cannot end, why their goals are purposefully vague, or if one does end another promptly starts. And of course to sanction such a state of perpetual war, ethics need to be constantly trumpeted: war as a "humanitarian necessity", a "universal human right", a "morally superior action" etc.Milius' "Red Dawn" was somewhat unique in the 1980s. Aesthetically, Milius also had a certain audacity, executing children, teachers and civilians, and finding some nightmarish visuals here and there. His career would quickly take a nosedive, though, before Steven Spielberg hired him to do some rewrites on "Saving Private Ryan", another, albeit less obvious, right wing fantasy. Bradley's film, in contrast, is both generic and anonymous, with a cast of token Asians, token African Americans, a cardboard evil villain and a muscular, all-American hero. It's unintentionally funny rather than thrilling.7/10 - Worth no viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, but there's a lot of appeal nonetheless and it's memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Red Dawn" does a good job setting up its somewhat fantastical scenario but it's very much a product of its time and might not ring the same way it did when it was first released. I still feel like has a certain amount of appeal, but if you love this movie it's mostly the nostalgia talking. When the United States is invaded by the Soviet Union and its Cuban and Nicaraguan allies, the Americans are overwhelmed. While this Third World War rages, our story begins to take place. A small group of high school students arm themselves, hide in the woods and resist the invaders with guerrilla warfare, assembling underneath the name of their high school mascot, the Wolverines.The special effects are good and to someone that would be genuinely fearful of an invasion by the soviets this could be a dream come true or a really frightening scenario. I enjoyed the fact that the film gets into its premise right away, telling anyone that doesn't buy the premise to promptly leave the theatre or stop complaining about the events that are taking place. The film also does a good job portraying the long passage of time and the changes that happen to the characters as they become more accustomed to guerilla warfare. Where the film doesn't work is in the emotional growth and towards the end where our heroes make decisions that feel out of character and downright stupid. While I was able to buy the premise fully, I did find that this story doesn't feel as fleshed out as it should be. I'm leaning more towards "video game-like" than "epic" when choosing what word to define the storyline, despite the fact that there is a full-blown war going on.If you can suspend your disbelief (and the film does take the time to set itself up as a possible scenario so it shouldn't be too hard) and put yourself in the mentality of the red scare you will get a kick out of this, though you might leave wanting more when it comes to the story and characters.

		<fullReview>No it's not BS that trained soldiers were getting killed by guerilla soldiers. In Veitnam the US troops were being gunned down by fighting guerillas, also during the American revolution it was the US militia that was taking out the "mighty British." No one would know the territory better than the guerilla fighters. Also so what if the plot's a little far fetched, movies are made by the creator's imagination. It's not "Based on a true story." It's the only movie that really touches on the subject, and if the US was ever invaded, there would be many of us grabbing a gun trying to defend this land. *SPOILER* The last part of the movie, when the general spares Swayze's character after seeing him holding his deceased brother was something I'd never forget. I'd give it a 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rent this flick and watch the lead fly! Some very well done shootouts in Red Dawn make it a must-see for fans of action films.Things not to think about:1) How the Communist invasion is pulled off. I mean, think about it as a mental exercise if you wish, but it's not really the point of the film, so don't let it take away from your enjoyment. It needs to happen to set up the plot, a MacGuffin if you will.2) How a bunch of lightly armed paratroopers not two hours on the ground can beat off an attack by a mechanized unit in what appears to be excellent tank country.3) How these kids can cause the amount of trouble they do without sustaining any casualties whatsoever throughout much of the movie. It's a fact that lightly armed guerrilla units can be a definite thorn in the side of conventional forces through the use of hit and run tactics, they tend to have very high casualty rates. Example on both counts: The Viet Cong.So ignore that stuff, among other things. This isn't real. It ain't art. It's not even propaganda. It's just an action flick with an interesting premise/backdrop. Actually, now that I mention the "anti-soviet/communist propaganda" angle that a few folks here seem to subscribe to, let me note that Communist regimes tend to be the authors of their own worst propaganda through their very actions. This is the most murderous system of government in human history we're talking about, folks, and to state/imply otherwise is to immediately peg oneself as willfully blind or stupid. So pardon me for not much caring if this film offend communist sensibilities.*ahem* Where was I? Oh yeah. All the equipment is well rendered, but sharp-eyed individuals will notice an both an American and German vintage WWII AT gun on a train toward the end. Anal, I know, but I thought I'd throw it in. *SPOILER* The whole, "We gotta set up a distraction so everyone else can split" set up toward the end is a little strained, but I guess it was the most dramatic way for Patrick Swayze to die.Not a seminal piece of cinema, but if this is your thing, it won't be a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Hate Las Vegas!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate Las Vegas because I have been hypnotized; there is absolutely no other logical explanation on why I love this movie, except one day as I lay in slumber a sneaky man with a swirly coin crept into my room and whispered these sweet words in my ear, "When I snap my fingers you will love Red Dawn for all eternity, no matter how much you analyze or ridicule it, you will forever be bound to this motion picture." When the fingers snapped and my eyes flipped open on this fateful day I was, much like he foretold, forever bound to this film. Now I can't even begin to describe the laugh out loud problems with this film; alright I can give it a shot. Let's say I believe this alternate reality where Russia and communism prevails during the Cold War, fine no problem there. Moving on let's say I understand that these communist forces are interested in invading the United States for natural resources; still o.k. But after taking these things into account I still cannot for the life of me figure out why they would parachute an armored division into a small town in Colorado. What possible tactical advantage could you have being in an isolated state that is surrounded on all sides? The movie only gets better from there as the carnage begins; Mr. Tisdale (Also known as Eclipse from Lockup fame) is brutally massacred by a hail of gunfire after he tries to reason with these apparently off course skydivers. Uh, Mr. Tisdale these men have a whole bunch of guns maybe we should run out the back? Then again maybe not. After poor Tisdale goes down our hero, Patrick Swayze comes and saves the day by grabbing a handful of students and piling them into his pickup, they proceed to get the necessary provisions, (A football and some rice crispy treats) and head for the mountains only to have a hole shot into their radiator. Good thing old Jed (Swayze) knows how to fix those things MacGyver style (Probably with egg whites) and fortunately for them Danny has to go to the bathroom at that time. It's hard to document the film from here except for the funny things that happen within it; one, the boys sneak into town, (apparently something happened to the truck that we never find out about), and speak to a lady about toothbrushes; this lady, who happens to be a friend says the Cuban/Soviet troops are looking for them, which is funny because at this exact moment what appears to be a high ranking officer is staring directly at their faces and doesn't make a peep. Hilarity continues to ensue when the cast of misfits, labeled the Wolverines, begins to grow. For some reason Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey join the squad only to make a few retarded comments, and then one Powers Boothe comes aboard as an Airforce Colonel who tries to inform us how the war efforts are going. My personal favorite part is when he is reciting what allies the U.S has, and informs how there are 600,000,000 screaming China men on our side. Darrell proceeds to state, "I thought there was a billion screaming China men?" Which the colonel replies, "There was." So let me get this straight, in this war China alone has lost over 400,000,000 people; which is roughly 80 times more loss of life than WWII. Since I apparently love this film I don't want to ruin too much more of it for you, except pay attention to when Jed is crying alone on a mossy rock, when he sniffs a big snot bubble comes out his nose which he quickly sucks back in; how did they miss this in editing. Also when the Soviet helicopter captain is talking about how to catch this band of Wolverines he has a picture of the actual animal on a white board; what would this accomplish, knowing what kind of furry critter they have named themselves after. Maybe it's just me and I am missing something important there. But the Judge does personally want you to enjoy this film, but hopefully you haven't been hypnotized like I have. If only I could go back in time and found out who did this to me, wait a second, where was Patrick Swayze on that particular night? He has some questions to answer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was so terrible, I decided to write my first review, so try not to be too harsh on me.The basic plot is that a rural town is under siege by a Russian-Cuban army and a group of teenagers escape and try to stop it, seems plausible, right? Maybe the acting can save it? Nope, the acting was terrible, way over the top and very two dimensional. Any emotional scene appeared very contrived and forced. Most of the scenes didn't go together very well either. The majority of the movie consisted of American teenagers killing the Commie invader. However, there was no plan, no end goal, no furthering of the plot by the killings. All you knew was that they were probably killing Commies and because of this the action was very mind-numbing.It was also very ironic that for being a movie where the star-spangled banner Americans defend their homes from the Commies, the only character to show compassion and let a wounded enemy get away is one of the Communists.There is some redeeming value in that not all of this band of rebels aka "Wolverines" make it out alive, although this hardly makes it worth watching.Bottom lines is if you are looking for a an action/war movie, stay away from this one unless you're a masochist. It is one of the very few movies that I had to take two sittings to get through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somebody called this "possibly the worst film of all time" which is ridiculous. I've seen Red Dawn numerous times &amp; although the film is very flawed, it's just asinine to think this might even 'possibly' be the 'worst film of all time'. By contemporary standards it's pure fargin' ART compared to say, Fantastic 4. In it's own time...how 'bout Dirty Dancing? But, "OF ALL TIME"!?!?! You can't just throw a statement like that around when there's garbage like Day of the Dead 2: Contagium out there. Red Dawn at least has a certain amount of entertainment value in it's well executed vicariously cathartic vengeance theme (suckers me in every time)....AND you can laugh at all the little goofs like Colonel Bella expressing his previous allegiance to insurgents in such countries as "ANGOLIA", or the main premise of a modern day ground attack on this country...until you start thinking about how many of our troops are currently really far away....hmmm....Plus, this is a definitive 80's flick (like Weird Science or ET)...and Patrick Cheeezy, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson &amp; Powers Boothe provide memorable presences....if not performances.Although director John Milius appears to have rested on his dubious laurels through much of the production, I still feel that this film, over time, has achieved iconic placement in the grand scheme of things. It belongs in the time capsule, faults and all.WOLVERINES!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Relies too much on viewers' goodwill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Time and distance have not been too kind to this movie, but then I suspect that the budget wasn't either. Too much was spent on the helicopter prosthetics, and not enough on writing, casting and cinematography.'Red Dawn' attempts to tell a common story: what would you do to protect your way of life, and how would those acts of protection change you? It is a movie about resistance to and insurgency against an invader; there is such brutality on both sides that one wonders whether the end justifies the means. It could be construed as an anti-war movie, but I was left with the impression that it was a blatant appeal to the audience: 'The Commies are coming! The Commies are coming!'Like all movies with a political overtone, 'Red Dawn' is very much a zeitgeist, intended to satisfy an ephemeral hunger. Some movies of this ilk are so well-made that they eventually become classics, but this tale of US insurgency against a Soviet invasion cannot be described thus. It is disappointing that a promising idea has been so badly handled; in fact, I wonder whether the project was rushed just to catch the wave of President Reagan's defence policy. It is interesting to note that, had they waited a year, the producers would have been faced with the difficult task of selling a movie in the 'Pink Dawn' of Glasnost.With the concept of zeitgeist (or perhaps 'cash-in') in mind, one may be tempted to forgive all those involved for just going through the numbers and hoping to rely on patriotic support. Many more successful film-makers, however, have realised that it's not enough to preach to the converted. John Milius and Kevin Reynolds should have studied the past and looked at British movies of the 1940s for examples of how to tell a story to people who don't want to listen. It may appear cruel to cite the works of two of the 20th century's best writers, but good writers are needed to tell this kind of story. 'In Which We Serve' (1942, w. Noel Coward) and 'Went the Day Well?' (1942, w. Graham Greene) were two low-budget movies that concentrated on the way of life that their heroes were fighting for. In the case of Coward's work, stranded sailors reflected on this life in a series of flashbacks, whereas with Greene, initially jolly English villagers were faced with a small-scale Nazi paratroop raid. These movies, and many like them, took care to generate empathy in the audience, and reminded them of the need to struggle. Such a simple trick was carelessly overlooked in 'Red Dawn.' In fact, one barely meets the characters before the war reaches them, and they spend little time afterwards considering or debating the changes they undergo. One feels that the writers are incapable of designing introspection. Most attempts to depict the American way of life are clumsy visual or audio clichés: the Flag, 'America the Beautiful' and Guns, lots of Guns. These references are handled in such a way as to make me wonder about the writers' ability to form personal relationships. An opportunity to render the rebel teenagers as 'Everymen' has been wasted; instead, they come across as ciphers.With no rounded characters, no time for thoughtful scenes, and with a set-up dismissed almost before the curtains sweep back, how does Milius fill his hour and three-quarters? With death, destruction and tears. The bulk of the movie consists of an unknown cast of Brat-Packers wandering around the Rockies blasting nearly everything with a red star. Very soon, any supportive thoughts the audience brought with them evaporate as they realise they are watching a movie not about resistance but revenge.Far too much time (and money) is spent on guns, tanks and helicopters. A tedious 'last-stand' scene is stretched out by dull photography focussing on a bunch of Bell choppers poorly dressed up as Soviet gunships. Many scenes of the rebels' deaths are ruined either by such cinematic clumsiness or by dreadful lines delivered by incompetent actors. Each time, I found myself not caring; making a viewer feel that way is the biggest crime in cinema.There is one positive item in the show: the only decent actor in the show is Harry Dean Stanton; since he is the reincarnation of Huckleberry Hound, it's hard not to like him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhere in hell, this movie is being shown...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Milius, director of laughable thug-flick Red Dawn, has a dictionary defining masculine as violent and incapable of coherent emotion. In the 1980s, he was the antithesis of the Iron John, touchy-feely movement, and Red Dawn was the movie that proved that the whole world thought he was a knuckle-dragging political neanderthal.Red Dawn isn't simply bad. It's so bad that people rent it so they can get drunk and laugh at it. Shot, as always with Milius, with locked-down cameras and muddy sound, it's a wedge of sheer, univentive, paranoid fear. The premise? Communists invade America. Where do they invade? Colorado. Yes, within twenty seconds of this movie starting, you'll be blinking in incomprehension. Somehow, the Soviets have airlifted an armoured infantry unit to the Rockies. No, no-one understands this at all, but then this is John Milius, the man whose original script for Apocalypse Now had Willard and Kurtz joining forces to kill the Viet Cong. Really.It's hard to tell what is most offensive about this movie: its stupidity or its low quality. No-one walks away from this blameless. The core cast are supposed to be a bunch of High School jocks who take to the hills and become guerilla experts overnight (how, you may ask? well, because they went deer hunting and that makes you a Real Man). What ensues is little more than a long splash of ineptly handled gun play, as the Wolverine's set up one tedious ambush after another and occasionally make masculine shrieking sounds. Get past the fact that this is the movie that, if it didn't kill the career (C. Thomas Howell, where art thou now?), it severely crippled (Lea Thompson, Charlie Sheen, Ferris Beuller's sister) several.Then there's the military element. Words fail me as to how ill-concieved this is. The idea that there would be a conventional invasion with no nuclear retaliatory strike by America is so laughably poor that it amazes me that this movie ever got green-lit.What is most appalling is that this is such a blatantly right-wing propoganda exercise. Fiercely anti-gun control (it is suggested that the Demycrats want to take your weapons so that Communists can pillage your households), thoroughly white-bread (the only black characters dies in the opening scene, while the Russians use illegal Mexican migrants to mastermind the disruption of services and infrastructure) and with some horrific gender politics (a grandfather handing over his granddaughters to the Wolverines has some pretty unpleasant connotations), this is a movie that heads through unapologetic and lurches straight into unforgiveable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Red Dawn": A Steady Diet of Paranoia, Demonization, and Xenophobia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before commenting on "Red Dawn" I have to say that I am from the "Evil Empire". It is necessary to include a comparison to a Soviet movie about Partisans/Resistance Movement called "The Black Birch"(1978) to see where "Red Dawn" is just propaganda."Black Birch" is quite similar to "Red Dawn". There is the ruthless enemy, in this case the Nazi invasion troops. There is massive destruction of urban areas(cities) by the invasion forces, many civilians are killed. The heroes hide in the forest and form a Partisan/Resistance Group. The group rescues a downed Soviet pilot, and fights enemy Snow troops during the Winter.This is where the similarities end. The Partisans in "Black Birch" are not 7 kids living on canned soup in the mountains, they are mostly full grown adults, and out of around 50 people about 30 are soldiers trapped behind enemy lines. The leader of this Partisan group is not a High School Football team Quarterback, he is an experienced Army Captain who served in an Artillery battery. The unit wages a successful campaign against German Supply trains not because they "know how to hunt" but because they have the military training and use it effectively.The viewer gets to see what the characters think and how their lives transform during war time and in the ruined cities of peace time after the invaders are defeated. The "ruthless" Germans in the movie do execute "terrorist collaborators"; they use a woman who treated wounded Partisans as an "example" to the rest of the local population. In "Red Dawn" local people are sadistically executed for no real reason in the middle of no-where to the music of the Soviet Anthem."Black Birch" had plenty of scenes to make people think about the hardship and suffering of being a Resistance Fighter, in "Red Dawn" the kids act like Rambo for most of the movie. Suffering? In the middle of a forest with little to survive on, no suffering here!"Red Dawn" was very much like the other American movies starting with "Red" or "Rambo" during the 1980's and 90's. There was the handful of super-human Americans and 1,000's of incompetent/greedy/evil Reds/Commies/Russians. Even "Red Heat" stereotyped Russians as cold and emotionless. All of the above makes sense if this movie is nothing more than Propaganda. 1. Excessive use of national symbols to build up patriotism in the population. 2. De-humanizing the enemy. Joseph Goebbels would be proud of some of the scenes, several examples: a. Just several minutes into the movie before the Paratroopers start killing everything that moves the school teacher is talking about the "Mongol Horde" and how it destroyed everything in its path wiping out civilization. Historically Nazi Propaganda referred to Russians and Slavs as the "sub-humans" who originated from "Asiatic" blood, the "Great Asian Horde from the East"(Russia) were to be wiped out because they "threatened" the 3rd Reich. Nazis linked "barbaric" Mongolian culture with Russian, and dehumanize Russians and those like them as sub-human monsters, just like in "Red Dawn". b. The BTR crew are shown as rapists(directly out of Goebbel's own speeches) who chase after any woman and sexually assault her, in fact as I understand it, apparently my own culture is nothing but "mafia, rapists, and maniacs" according to the American point of view. c. The execution scene. Again, those "monsters without souls" massacre dozens of civilians without a reason; bodies pile up in mass graves. The Director thinks Soviet Army = Waffen SS, and that scene associating the Soviet Anthem with Mass Murder was just intentional propaganda. The Waffen SS did it for 2 reasons, General Plan Ost "Genocide Campaign" in the USSR, and as revenge for Partisan attacks on German officers in which 100 civilians were executed for each dead German officer. No such policy was ever practiced by the Soviet Army after WW2, because it never worked, it always had the opposite effect.3. Heroes with Super-human abilities. There is no doubt in my mind that the "Wolverines" represent the American "Super Race"(Aryans). The Director borrows from Fascist propaganda to make his characters appear as perfect individuals fighting against the "inferior"(Russian) enemies. 4. Message is filled with strong feelings for domestic Political Ideology. Just like the Ultra-Nationalist countries the Americans in this movie are depicted as fiercely loyal to their form of government and economics. Even if their government is wrong, it is always right. Anybody who associates him/her self with other political views is "un-American". Communism and Socialism are so twisted in this movie that it appears no different from the Racist system of Nazi Germany.Other points: a. There were no "Re-education Camps" used by the Soviet Army in the 1980's, in Afghanistan there were regular Prisons for suspected insurgents. b. In no way was this film realistic as some claim. And Afghanistan and Chechnya are not Colorado. Afghans were trained to fight from age 12, Chechen separatists were former-Soviet Army troops and officers. Afghans live a life stuck in the 12th century with mud brick homes without electricity or running water or any other modern "western" household items (death in battle is the fastest way to heaven). The only real possession 50% of Afghans have is a rifle, mostly Bolt-Action in the 1980's, but thanks to American efforts now include automatic rifles. And Afghans fight in Clan wars, Pashtuns against Tajiks and Turkmen against Arab Bedouins, by the age of 30 most have combat experience, while to Americans hunting is only a "sport", fighting to Afghans means surviving in life. c. During the film Soviet troops are shown in Parade Uniforms instead of Battle Dress Uniform. Long Great-coats and bright red epaulets were no longer used in front line service by 1960. Olive Drab(and camouflage) was the only color one had on a uniform, and Parkas replaced the long brown colored Coats. Body Armor vests and helmets were also issued to Soldiers in 1984.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cheesy guilty pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ronald Reagan was right, those dirty commies are going to invade our shores. The film takes place in a small town in rural Colorado, right in the middle of the second red scare, during the 1980&#x2032;s. The Russians, Cubans and some other nefarious commies attack the town right in the middle of history class. Troops parachute in behind the school, open fire and start to take over the town. Who can honestly say they did not daydream such a scenario during a particularly boring lecture in high school? Prepare for a mashup of a high school teen drama an action packed war film and some cheesy fun.As the bullets start flying our heroes make their escape in Jed's (Swayze) pickup truck. Teachers, fellow classmates, townspeople are being gunned down and rounded up, as the boys make their way to a general store on the outskirts of town. Thankfully, the boys are able to load up on supplies, bows, guns, canned food, sleeping bags, water etc are quickly loaded into Jed's truck. The group heads to the perceived safety of familiar hunting grounds in the wooded mountains, to escape capture.unfortunately, the groups radio was shot up in the escape. Lacking information about what has happened in the town, and running low on supplies, the group consisting of Jed (Swayze), Robert (Howell), Matt (Sheen) Daryl (Dalton), Aradvark (Toby) and Danny (Savage), decide to conduct a reconnaissance mission in town. The group is horrified to discover, that the town is under martial law, and that the Russian invaders have occupied a large section of the United States. To make matters even worse family members, and people who helped in their escape have been killed, or placed in re-education camps. Jed and Matt visit their wounded father, Mr. Eckert (Stanton) locked in a re-education camp, and learn their mother is dead, along with other family members. He instructs the boys, to stay in the mountains, never cry for him and to "Avenge Me!!!! Avenge Me!!!". Stanton might provide the only part of the film that would be considered passable acting during this scene.A random run in with some occupying troops, making a tourist stop in the mountains, to snap some photos, leads to the group killing 3 troops. The occupying forces react to these killings by rounding up some townspeople, and executing them en mass, at the funeral for the slain troops. Witnessing the killings from afar the group decides to exact revenge via gurellia warfare. This is when the film really starts to take off both in terms of action, excitement, and complete lack of plausibility. The rest of the movies details the groups increasing successful attacks upon the occupying troops and the brutality of the occupiers. WOLVERINES!!!!!!This film is a bit difficult to review as it saddled with a ludicrous plot, wooden acting, lack of character development and forced emotion. By the same token its undeniably fun to watch, as the guerrilla group known as the wolverines extracts a terrible, if un-realistic revenge upon those evil commie invaders. This film lands firmly in the realm of cheesy, guilty pleasure. People who came of age in the 1980&#x2032;s probably recall this film fondly, and considered the possibility of joining the wolverines, on more than one occasion. New viewers might be a bit confused by what all the fuss was about with this film. The bottom line is that this is not a very good movie. However, much like ones inability to pass up greasy cheeseburger or a sugary bear claw, it's an enjoyable experience. While I cannot with good conscience give this film a high score, I still recommend giving this guilty pleasure a watch.Like what you see here?

		<shortDescription>Okay war movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RED DAWN is set in the time of war, when the Soviet Union takes over the United States. When they capture many of the parents of one city's youth, the teenagers band together to fight back against the Soviets and try to win their country back. The teenagers' unofficial leader is Jed (Patrick Swayze), whose brother is Matt (Charlie Sheen). Other members of the guerrilla squad are Robert (C. Thomas Howell), and Erica (Lea Thompson) and Toni (Jennifer Grey), two girls picked up from friends to keep custody of. In such a rough time as war--how will they all survive?Let me start off my critique by saying that the plot is absolutely ridiculous. The Soviet Union invading America? Okay. The soldiers capturing parents and leaving teenagers alone on their own? Fine. But those teenagers forming a GUERRILLA army to fight the Soviets? It's unbelievably unrealistic. You can't even fathom any possible way that this could happen. Other than that--the script is awful except for a few great one-liners (most of them given to the character of Robert). The movie is much too long and gets incredibly boring after a while. But, there's some good in everything...A few of the scenes in RED DAWN are incredibly powerful. The opening sequence of the soldiers sailing down onto the school campus is amazing, and I'll never be able to forget the scene where the boys are driving away in the truck and one of their fathers is left behind. The boy shouts, "Papa! Papa!" And the father is calling out to his son, but the soldiers get him before the boy can. That's heart-wrenching stuff right there. Also, after Jed and Matt see their father in the military camp, and basically any scene involving the teenagers' parents, is great. It's very touching and relatable, as well as the fact that is displays some fine acting. The acting is pretty good for the most part, but the actors really aren't given a lot to work with. The action scenes are all pretty great, but unfortunately more of the focus is on the characters, which, in this case, is insanely boring.RED DAWN is an okay war movie. If it had instead focused on the characters and them coping with the loss of their parents, that would have been a good movie, given that the elements I described were continued. But instead, this ridiculous plot is thrown in and drawn out. By the end, I really didn't care what happened to the characters. There's a couple of good displays of great acting (C. Thomas Howell in particular does very well, playing the best character in my opinion), and the action scenes are good--but this probably won't interest most people. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not an all around bad flick if you take it for what it is. A bunch of high school kids who are also a part of a football team known as the Wolverines escape to the mountains after the Russians invade the country. The kids staring Charlie Sheen, Patrick Swayze and C Thomas Howell wage a type of gorilla war against the invading army. They are latter joined by Powers Booth (an Air Force pilot that was shot down) and believe it or not Jennifer Grey of Dirty Dancing fame. The gorilla war continues with victory after victory over well armed soldiers....Like a said take it for what it is. Towards the end much of the rag tag group of Wolverines is dead and we learn that this war they were fighting ended like all wars end. OK.No real plot just a lot of battle scenes that make no sense and defy logic...so if you like Rambo then this one is for you. But the kids hiding up in the mountains and attacking the Russians and then running was fun at times.....It was said that this movie was in the Gunnies Book of World Records having the most people die at 246. I believe it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wolverines!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is kept pretty simple and straightforward and also touched a sensitive nerve at the time, since the cold war was still fully going on at the time. It's about the Russians and Cubans invading the United States and thereby unleashing WW III. The movie focuses on a small group of teenagers in a small American town, who turn themselves into an effective guerrilla force, named the Wolverines, to battle the communist invaders.But the movie does not really have a sense of realism. The movie doesn't feel like this could have ever or shall ever really occur. It's because the movie is rather simple. It also doesn't really tries to provoke or anything. This movie feels more like a spoof of what can actually happen than a serious movie trying to make a statement and sent out a warning. It's hard to ever take this movie seriously and just see it for what it is; pure entertainment.All of the Russians and Cubans are extremely stereotypical evil and their methods and regime reminds more of the WW II Nazi-regime. But I think that the movie also does a good job as portraying the Americans not as kind-hearted peace loving folks. It shows that nobody is really innocent in a war time situation and you're being forced into things you normally wouldn't ever do or even think of.The movie its battle sequence are pretty good looking. The invasion forces and their weapons look good and realistic and the movie has some nice action sequences. Overall the movie really does give you the sense and feeling of an actual war-time situation.The movie also has some nice looking scenery and with yet another awesome musical score from Basil Poledouris, who did some of his best work with director John Milius.The movie has a great '80's cast with big names from that period such as Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson, Charlie Sheen, Jennifer Grey and Harry Dean Stanton. Grey and Swayze would later work together again as the two main characters in "Dirty Dancing", despite the fact that they didn't like each other very much personally.It's not really a great movie but interesting to watch nevertheless because of its concept.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as some say.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Red Dawn' is one of those movies I sometimes feel guilty seeing, but was a product of its time. Though we didn't know it, the Cold War was nearing its end, and the Berlin Wall would be history 5 years later. However, Gorbachev had not yet assumed the Soviet presidency &amp; Americans were still nervous about nuclear war.It begins in Colorado, when a teacher sees paratroops landing on the field of a small high school. When he goes out to investigate, he is savagely gunned down by Soviet soldiers. The soldiers then open fire on the school, sending the students running for cover. A small group, led by Jed (Swayze) &amp; Matt (Sheen) Eckert, head for the mountains with Robert (Howell) &amp; 2 others. After evading Soviet troops, tanks, &amp; aircraft, they reach Robert's dad's store where they pick up camping gear, food &amp; weapons. Escaping into the mountains, they set up camp. 2 days later, they return to the town which is under control of the Soviet Army. They learn the KGB is hunting for them, and after leaving they stop at a family friend's where they learn Robert's dad was murdered by Soviet soldiers who came looking for the guns. They also pick up the man's granddaughters, Toni (Grey) &amp; Erica (Thompson) who are hiding in a cellar after Soviet soldiers tried to rape them. Soon after, a Soviet patrol heads into the highlands where they are hiding out, and the teens encounter them. One soldier goes after Toni in spite of warnings from the other soldiers, and is killed with his own gun. A second soldier runs into Robert, who guns him down, and the third soldier escapes back to his jeep in spite of serious wounds. The young man gasps a warning over the radio, but Jed catches up to him, and the terrified young man looks at Jed then turns away before Jed shoots him at point-blank range. This is the first hint that some in the group are humanizing the soldiers that they killed.When the invasion's commander discovers the dead Soviet soldiers, he orders the town's residents - one of whom is the Eckert boys' dad (Stanton) to dig graves for the dead men, then savagely murders them by firing squad. One of the Eckert boys sees it happen, and they start planning guerrilla-type operations against the Soviet troops. The first involves Toni riding a bike to a fueling station where a Russian tank is being fueled, and when the soldiers take her bag it contains a grenade which kills the tank's driver. As Toni runs across an open field with the tank's crew on her heels, 3 of the boys pop up out of foxholes &amp; gun down the men. Encouraged by their success, they continue with others, the most notable of which is an attack on a firing squad. As Russian soldiers &amp; their C.O. line up civilians for the firing squad, the officer gives the command to aim - and then suddenly the entire firing squad is cut down by the 'Wolverines', allowing the civilians to escape.In the dead of winter, they find a new ally in Lt-Col. Andrew Tanner (Boothe) of the U.S.A.F. Tanner, an F-15 pilot, had destroyed 4 of 5 Soviet MiG fighters before being shot down. With a military man in their midst, they find out about the extent of the invasion &amp; Col. Tanner begins helping them plot new guerrilla operations, including rescuing political prisoners from the so-called 're-education' camps.Soviet Colonel Strelnikov (William Smith) is brought in to hunt down the 'Wolverines' &amp; eliminate them, but his plans soon go awry after one of his soldiers is captured &amp; killed by the Wolverines, and an attempt to hunt them down with MiL-Mi24 helicopter gunships fails. By now, the enraged Col. Bella (O'Neal) has become disillusioned with the invasion &amp; plans to return home to his wife in Cuba. General Bratchenko, the Russian officer in charge of the invasion, is killed in a raid by Matt &amp; Jed. Colonel Strelnikov manages to fatally wound both Matt &amp; Jed, but is ambushed &amp; killed by Jed while searching for Matt. When he spots Matt &amp; Jed, both mortally wounded, Bella points his AK-47 at him, but decides not to shoot. Perhaps now both sides have begun to see each other as humans, not so different from each other.Though a Soviet invasion in this way would have been near-impossible, it was a chilling alternative to 'The Day After', which basically portrayed a nuclear wasteland. 'Red Dawn' presented an equally chilling possibility to Americans - living under the iron fist of a Soviet communist dictatorship where the KGB ran your life, and the realization that insurgents could force something as powerful as the Soviet Army to retreat. Not a bad movie at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Call Out The Wolverines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The scenario depicted in Red Dawn didn't happen as we all know. The Cold War ended with a fadeout instead of a bang, the USA did not get invaded. At first glance Red Dawn seems like a quaint and ancient propaganda piece, but it still raises some interesting issues.Note how the invasion of America happened. Lots and lots of illegal aliens crossed our borders and infiltrated from within. Back in the day Red Dawn was National Rifle Association recruiting material, today however it's the film that the strict immigration people must love the most.Several members of the Eighties Brat Pack gave stand out performances in Red Dawn like Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, Jennifer Grey, Lea Thompson and Charlie Sheen. Considering what he's peddling now, I wonder if Charlie Sheen likes to be reminded of his participation in Red Dawn. Swayze and Howell are brothers who when the paratroop invasion happens at their high school, they zoom on out of there, take supplies, weapons and ammunition and lead a guerrilla movement in their little corner of Colorado.It's fascinating that the northeast of the United States didn't get invaded and that was the Free Zone. You wonder if the young people in blue state America would fight as these kids do. Kids like Howell and Swayze today are what make up our Armed Forces, they are a precious commodity indeed, blood not to be spent extravagantly or unwisely.Red Dawn is dated in some ways, relevant in others. It's super-patriotic, jingoistic, never explains really but for a brief voice over prologue why all these people don't like us. But at the same time it invokes a fighting spirit in America that I hope never dies, because we will die.It's nice to discuss geopolitics, look for economic solutions to age old problems, try to make people respect each other's differences. When the bombs are dropped though, discussion and reason are over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There at filming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So in '84, I was in elementary school. The teachers has us walk a whole 3 blocks down to the Middle school where the para trooping scene was shot, later I did have an art class in that same room. My friend's father worked on some of the sets, and my friend got a hold of some of the machine-gun rounds from the movie...we'd throw them in the air , and watch them explode in "blood" on the ground.All the locations you see in the "forest" and mountains in the movie I have been to...the gas station out of town never existed, it was built for the movie. The opening scene of the movie is a shot of Grand Avenue, and at the far left there is a gas station, and behind that a tan-colored building with a cowgirl on...Supposed to be "Calumet, Colorado"...the caption beside the cowgirl says, "Calumet says, "howdy", where the Rocky Mountains meet the Great Plains" it's still there, and the city repainted it a few years ago. The gas station below "Calumet" blew up a few years later, a careless driver drove off with the nozzle in the tank.The in-town shooting locations were great for this movie...because my town boomed from the arrival of the train, and nearly busted when the train moved on. So, after the town dried up, we were left with numerous buildings, that were never used, and are now all on the National Register of Historic Buildings. The building that was "bombed" by the Wolverines is actually my favorite building, only for the extruded circular corner on the second story. The building is still standing, unused. Edit: February, 2007...the building collapsed, due to lack of maintenance of the owner/economy of the town. The town itself is just teemed with architectural beauty, from brick to stone to absolutely amazing Victorian homes, it's both sad and good that the town dwindled so rapidly and those with means didn't destroy the old and rebuild over it, leaving us with a heritage. The surrounding area really is as the Calumet painting says, the mountains back-dropping the meadows...thus the Spanish name, "Las Vegas" (Vegas meaning rolling hills or meadows). There are natural hot springs a tiny bit north of town, in a village called Montezuma, where there's a castle, recently re-furbished, as well as the Armand Hammer International College (pages of history there at Montezuma). And an even further 1 minute drive north or there is the area where the town used to get it's ice, one can see where they cut into the cliff face to catch the water, so it would ice up. I've climbed that cliff free-hand. Much further north of that, on a 2-lane road cut into the mountain that switches back numerous times and gives drivers and passengers a slight fright, one comes the the base of the mountain where the forest scenes were shot for the movie...there's no words to describe the views, and the movie barely scratched the surface as far as views go. A mysterious hermit used to live there...thus the title, "Hermit's Peak".As far as the others who have posted here about the movie, it was a movie that defined the times, the cold war and all. As far as the special effects goes, again, it was the early eighties, and apparently they didn't have a George Lucasian budget to work with. The special effects weren't too bad, I've seen worse from the same time. Patrick Swayze ended up buying a place out there, as well as a few other Hollywood types.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Rubbish" is too kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To call this piece of garbage "rubbish" is far too kind. The entire premise was ludicrous: anyone who actually knew anything about the conditions in the USSR at the time this film was made knew how completely impossible it would have been for the Soviets to invade the US. Anyone who knows anything at all about military strategy understands the absurdity of a land invasion crossing all Siberia and then coming down the Rockies. The proof of this is in the disastrous Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. If the Soviet Army couldn't control four million ill-armed Afghans, how on Earth could they be expected to deal with the might of the US? The real irony is that a great deal of what we see American teens doing really WAS done -- by young SOVIETS under Nazi occupation. The US has no experience with foreign invasions; the Russians (Ukrainians, Belorussians, Lithuanians, Latvians, etc.) most certainly do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Politics? Who cares, its just a fun action movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a movie like Red Dawn is made, one has to expect that people are going to read into the "deep messages" and "political viewpoints" the film seems to take. As a result, it appears the majority of people think Red Dawn is absurd and extremely right winged.And you know what? Maybe it is. But as far as I'm concerned, who cares? When you decide to watch a movie about communists invading the United States with the help of Cuba after NATO disbands, I would think that the first thing you would do is suspend disbelief. Some movies in general are simply meant to entertain, and I personally believe that deep down, that is all Red Dawn means to do. And it excels at it. Simply put, this is just an action movie. And if you are going to pick it apart by calling it right winged and unbelievable then you might as well say the same about films like Rambo II in which a "God of War" sort of guy demolishes vietnamese and Russian "bad guys" or hell even the Die Hard movies which has one man battling an army of freelance terrorists who are shutting down the US in it's fourth installment.Red Dawn is no different than these. I for one have seen the film numerous times on television as well as on DVD and just have a blast watching it. Heck, the DVD even comes with a "CARNAGE COUNTER" which tells you how many communists die, how many wolverines die, how many explosions are shown, and how many RPG's are fired. This alone should immediately let the viewer be aware that its all about the action. I mean what kind of "political war film" has a death toll and explosion counter on its DVD? Just have fun with it! Watch it with an open mind, suspend disbelief, and for added bonus watch the Rambo movies after it to get a marathon of similar films going! Red Dawn is wicked fun, the characters are well developed, and the sub-plots of survival in both are actually somewhat fascinating.This is yet again a movie that is read into far too much. Sure there may be political viewpoints in it but when 90% of the film is explosions and shoot-outs I'd think it would be clear that these politics are not meant to be focused on. Basically, I loved it.Wolverines!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a sucker for Cold War nostalgia and American movies that were made during that era (even if they deal with the subject in a lopsided way), but even I can't get a kick out of "Red Dawn". It's kind of intriguing to see pre-"Dirty Dancing" Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey and pre-"Ferris Bueller's Day Off" Charlie Sheen and Jennifer Grey on screen together, but that's about all the fun you get out of this 1984-picture. Apart from numerous technical flaws (the horrible acting, a boring story without any dramatic peaks or even good action sequences) the morals of "Red Dawn" are so screwed up that half a century later we can only look back and shake our heads in wonder.Although there are moments in which the writers of the movie seem to express vaguely humanistic thoughts - such as when one American character wonders who will ever be able to distinguish winners and losers in this (Cold) war, when the American heroes turn against each other at one point and aren't so sure what makes them different to their enemy anymore, or when a "bad" Colonel shows a human side (in a horribly contrived scene where he writes a letter to his lover back home) -, "Red Dawn" sells killing and martyrdom as something cool without ever depicting the horrors of war properly. We see heroic teenagers fighting for their country and slaughtering the enemies in huge numbers (just were they get all their gear from is never explained properly). There's a scene in which the father of the two main characters (played by Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen) talks to his sons from behind the fence of an improvised gulag. As he sends the boys away he screams after them: "AVENGE ME!" It is this scene where you realize that something's terribly off about "Red Dawn".Much like "True Blood: Rambo" and "Rambo III", "Red Dawn" is propaganda of the most idiotic kind and leaves one looking with much skepticism to the soon to be released remake of "Red Dawn", where invading Chinese replace the Soviet army. Shouldn't we who think of ourselves as part of a free western society have moved past this kind of movie by now?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal, with interesting images</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not particularly good acting or anything like that, but I like this movie for two reasons: 1. America has never been invaded by a foreign power. We are used to seeing textbook images and film footage of small European towns in smoking ruins w/ occupying troops, etc. It just seems "normal" to us through the process of learning history. It was particularly striking to me to see these images played out in an American town.2. I thought the movie was particularly brutal w/ respect to the murderous aspects of war. In particular the scene on mountain overview where the kids make their first kills...tentatively and almost accidentally. Aboslutely chilling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I own this movie on DVD now, brings back the 80s for me, we loved this movie when we were teenagers, you know, when the Russians were the bad guys?I liked it... of course the plot is unrealistic, given what we know about Russian capabilities NOW, but you know back in the day? You have to remember, this movie came out around Grenada, the KAL 007 Airliner shootdown, lots of badstuff. The Russians wasted a 747 over their airspace, things werent too nice back then.My students think its funny in spots, its a brat packer movie for sure, get the popcorn, suspend some disbelief (come on this isn't warp drive or some such crap) and be entertained!TECHNICAL GRIPES - beefs folks have. OK, I know.. Ken you said its a popcorn movie, I'm only saying that the script folks aren't THAT dumb..- No nuke retaliation - Boothe's character says they took out our missiles, BUT, he never says we didn't nuke Russia too, he only says, the thing is pretty much conventional now. Obviously China got nuked (400 million dead)... NO "Day After" type effects.. but OK..- Too masculine - hello its a war movie. But the female characters get into the action, AND, the male characters cry, a lot. They are kids.- Kids can't fight - months pass in the movie, they learn to ambush folks. Ever read about resistance fighters in WW II? The Viet Cong? Some of those folks were kids.- Where's the army? Well the bulk of our forces AREN'T in Europe in the movie, they are home. NATO dissolves before the invasion, and "the U.S. stands alone" Which explains why 80 division came across the Bering straight, over half a million Cuban and Nicaraguan/Mexican troops invade, and we still aren't overrun.- Emphasis... the US stands alone. The movie assumes most everyone else (except England of course, and they wont last long) has been overrun, including Mexico. They are gong after our grain... The Russian is real, the ZSU-23 is accurate (thats the weird tank) and the technical weapons, etc are all great replicas (read the liner notes for the CIA snoping on the set wondering where they got their info.) Its not "the best war movie ever made - Alexander Haig" But it is a popcorn movie that will make you yell wolverines!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very bad propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am studying this movie in my humanities class and it is a very obvious piece of propaganda. Now propaganda isn't synonym of "bad movie" but in this case it is. The way the Americans are brave, strong winners and the Russians are nothing but brutes is pathetic. America did terrible things during the war just like the soviets did. The first scene when the teacher gets shot for no reason made me cringe. There also is the obvious bit, why would the soviets attack America directly and attack a small insignificant town, put all their efforts into finding a couple of high schoolers and just focusing on this town in general. What is even worse is that there is a second one coming out about north Korean troops attacking a bunch of highs schoolers again. Let's hope the acting is at least better than in the original red dawn in which, the lines are laughable, the emotions are pathetic and not realistic at all. Watching this movie was a horrible experience and i don't recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this in-theater when it was released in '84. It began with a quick back story flashed on-screen in bullet-point format, and once that was done I could tell it was going to be really, really bad. It did not prove me wrong.I couldn't tell whether this was American or Soviet propaganda. On the one hand it made you hate the Russians, who dropped out of the sky without warning despite NORAD, etc. But on the other, it seemed to be saying that we had nothing to fear from the USSR, because the entire Red Army could be defeated handily by a bunch of teenagers. The icing on the cake was when the kid stood up with a raised rifle and shouted "Wolverines!" in full view of an entire Soviet armored column, and yet did not get blasted to smithereens. I guess the Soviets must have left their ammo at home. Ha-ha, big joke! Just like this film.One star (only because IMDb won't let me rate it zero).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another reviewer argued that many people disliked this movie because it conflicted with their political philosophy. How, it's been asked, would the critics have responded if, instead of white Wolverines in Colorado, the story had been about the organization and revenge of a black basketball team in the next Civil War? Or how about if it had been Jewish kids fighting a Nazi invasion? I don't know how the critics would have responded, but I suspect that, to the extent the plot followed the one in "Red Dawn," they would have said it sucked.It has little to do with one's political philosophy. It has to do more with an appreciation of film making and a fondness or aversion to generic killing in a generic war.There's nothing particularly challenging in dehumanizing the enemy so thoroughly that Russian soldiers chase the school girls around town with rape on their minds, or Cubans parachute into a small peaceful community and machine gun unsuspecting and unarmed civilians, including teachers.That kind of unspeakable crap would have been revolting in a flag-waver out of 1943. And I wouldn't applaud the bloody and unthinking testosterone-ridden responses of the kids, even if they'd been black, Jewish, or homosexual.It's not a movie about Cubans and Russians. It's a movie about how good it feels to kill other people. It's a movie about a fictional Manichaean universe that is divided into all good and all evil. The evil part could be anyone -- Venezuelans, al Qaeda terrorists, or Canadians. They're only there to provide an excuse for adolescents to kill.When the Reds kill hostages, one of the high school kids begins to weep and Patrick Swayze hugs him and urges him not to cry, to hold it back, to turn it into anger, to save it for the carnage they will later inflict on the enemy.Did it touch a nerve? You bet it did. The vagus nerve, the one that induces stomach pain.Yet, let us not dismiss it without some applause for its sole virtue, though the film doesn't treat the issue as a virtue. The movie raises an interesting and thoroughly serious scientific and philosophical question. What dark part of our nature causes us to enjoy slaughtering others, even during an arousal jag in a movie theater?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Reaganite's wet dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red Dawn is 1980s right-wing cinema at its best, if you could call it that. Considering the time frame, the film becomes all the more ridiculous.An emboldened Soviet Union (in actuality on the verge of collapse at the time) invades the United States with her Cuban (another country with a teetering infrastructure) and Latin American allies. Following a successful invasion and occupation of large portions of America, a group of then-current teen heart throbs form a guerrilla resistance against the Commies.At the risk of sounding like a far-left Communist sympathizer, which I am not, the paranoia that the conservative screenwriters had is striking. I wish I could have reminded them that the United States in prior history sent military expeditions into Russia in 1918 and trained Cuban exiles to invade Cuba in 1961.Politics aside, this is just a bad movie. The ludicrous storyline about high school kids fighting off a huge Soviet war machine is simply too unbelievable, even for cinematic standards. The acting by the young ensemble actors is poor throughout, one notable instance being when the teary eyed boys visit their captured father. The dialogue, particularly, exemplifies atrocious writing; "WOLVERINES!!!" "Not bad for a bunch of kids, huh?" "Mama would be real proud.""They're gonna kill us! All of us!" "So why should we be different."Still, Red Dawn does have some merit as an encapsulating piece of a political atmosphere that ran rampant over America, much like the Russians in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie that might be lost in history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie took place during the height of Reagan's "Evil Empire" stage. He was pushing the US military to it's limits, trying to get a 600 ship navy among other things. There were 2 huge armies facing each other in Europe. Much of this movie is lost without such historical context, because the whole premise seems almost science fiction now, but was very real at the time. I joined the navy partially in 1980 because I feared a WW3 and wanted to get my service over with so I couldn't be drafted later. This movie serves as a primer on how to conduct guerilla warfare. They set up an ambush, predict the enemies lines of retreat or where they will go to dig in and setup traps or a secondary ambush. The acting might seem wooden to some but if you are fighting a guerilla war you aren't going to be joking around and have a smile on your face. The acting was appropriate to the darkness of the situation. The hopelessness of the odds, the treachery, questions of right and wrong are all brought out. Excellent if you interested in warfare at all, or the human mindset in such situations. Not popcorn fare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So lets cover what happens in this movie. The Russians decide to invade the USA by sneaking in via Mexico. The first target the Russians chose to hit when invading the world's greatest super-power is none other than............a local high school in a small town in the middle of no where (a strategic stroke of genius if ever I saw one). Unfortunately for us, the high school was apparently the majority of the USA's military and now the whole country is on the verge of being ruled by the Soviet Union. And the Soviets aren't taking prisoners either. After murdering everyone in the school, they proceed to execute every American who they deem as a threat and eventually reach Nazi-levels of genocide. But when all seems darkest, a force of freedom and righteousness comes to liberate the Country. A force powerful enough to halt the Soviets in their tracks. A force made up of............about six teens with a few civilian guns. Ummm....yeah.I remember when my friends and I used to play war as a kid. We came up with much more easy-to swallow scenarios than the one this movie is based on. I have a feeling that if we'd ever taken the time to film one of these games, our movie would have been a lot better acted than this one too. Most of the brat pack cast give some of their worst performances of the 80s (which is saying a lot) and the Russians tend to sound like they wandered in from a bad SNL skit. That said, it's hard really to blame the actors with such a awful script to work with. The only bright spot in the film is Milius's direction of the action sequences which is occasionally striking though not nearly enough to save this film. If you like Milius's style, watch Conan the Barbarian instead. At least that film knows that it's fantasy and makes its campiness work for it rather than against it.I'm sorry I don't share the love for this film that some do. I think it's because I'm not completely and utterly crazy. Perhaps if I was, I'd enjoy this paranoid conservative wet-dream. As it stands, the film is only worth watching just so you can tell your friends about it and say, "I swear, it's a real movie."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martin Sheen must have had a second heart attack when he learned that his son Charlie was starring in this NRA fantasy flick. The signature moment of the movie comes early, when "Colonel Bella" of the combined Cuban-Russian-Nicaraguan invading force orders his men to go round up the local gun registration forms which will conveniently tell them which citizens have guns and how many.Luckily for America, Patrick Swayze and a handful of high school jocks manage to escape the devilish clutches of hundreds of enemy soldiers by driving right through their ranks in a pickup truck, dodging a prolonged barrage of rockets and machinegun fire launched by the apparently cross-eyed invaders.Even luckier, one of their dads owns a filling station stocked with everything a red-blooded American boy needs to fight a war, including enough guns and ammo to hold the Alamo.Writer Kevin Reynolds and writer-director-chickenhawk John Milius spared us the actual invasion which would have explained how such bumbling Keystone Komrades could get past the high tech defense systems and massive military bases positioned near all U.S. borders. Instead they begin with the bad guys invading the tiny, Rocky Mountain hamlet of Calumet, the least likely town in America for such an invasion.To be fair to Reynolds, he later directed the brilliant war film "The Beast," so unless he had a brain transplant or is just a much better director than he was writer on this, the blame for "Red Dawn" seems to fall on Milius's shoulders. Which are no doubt laden with epaulettes and shiny brass buttons purchased in a surplus store.Later we do get the back story of the invasion, a preposterous scenario involving sabotage by illegal immigrant infiltrators at our top secret defense installations combined with a surprise attack by Russian soldiers flying in on commercial airlines. It worked in Afghanistan, we are told in the clunky dialog, so if it worked in a dirt poor desert nation of course it would work in the U.S.A.The first true moment in the film is an ironic one: when the boys investigate a commie re-education center and hear a loudspeaker declaring "America is a whore who has betrayed the intentions of her founding fathers." Of course watching this scene in the post-Enron, post-Halliburton era, the irony stands out more clearly than it would have in the "greed is good" eighties when this turkey was basted. But those were the good ole days, when we were arming the Taliban against the evil Russians.Harry Dean Stanton plays Patrick and Charlie's father, and this is undoubtedly the worst role of his career. His dialog hits rock bottom as he melodramatically emotes, "Boys! Avenge me! Avenge me!" before being led back to be "re-edumacated" by the Red invaders.Luck is still with the boys, however, or maybe God is on their side, because no matter how close they get to the enemy guards who are supposedly on high alert for them, they move freely and are never even noticed.Just when this boys'n'guns fantasy fest starts to seem suspiciously homoerotic, with long-in-the-tooth dancing queen Patrick Swayze butching it up as he lords over his fresh-faced recruits, alternately slapping them and hugging them in his leather clad arms, a couple of chicks are delivered into their care. By their grandfather no less. Who explains that the evil "sonsabitches tried to have their way" with the young virginal beauties. Well of course they would -- they're Russians, right? Let no cliché go unturned in this epic.Luckily, once again, the two unarmed sixteen-year-old girls managed to escape unravaged from the depraved, heavily armed but incredibly inept invaders. Soon enough, they get to exact some sweet revenge, dispatching a handful of the bumbling commie bastards with an arrow and a couple of well-placed bullets. Thankfully the Russki soldiers only had a few machineguns, and were much slower on the draw than the untrained American teenagers. Or maybe... just maybe... God was still on their side.Soon the American "Wolverines" are wielding an endless supply of rocket launchers, heavy machineguns and grenades. Even better, they acquire stylish berets and other fashion accessories befitting their revolutionary status. No doubt if there was room in the budget, they would have finished the film piloting supersonic jets.On and on it goes. The pompous soundtrack telegraphs every glorious moment. The cornball dreck keeps piling up like a steaming dump of dinosaur poo. In fact, this cheese and ham soufflé is so ludicrous that if it was baked a few more minutes, it could have been another "Airplane" or "Naked Gun." For anyone seeking the vicarious thrill of what it's really like to survive in an occupied country, a movie version of Jan Karski's incredible true story of the Polish resistance in WW2 is supposed to be filmed sometime soon. Hopefully John Milius will not be allowed within a thirty mile radius of the production, and the creative parties involved won't stink it up with typical Hollywood "improvements." Better yet pick up a used copy of Karski's "Story of a Secret State." There are more thrills in the first ten pages than in this overblown crock of excrement.And if you're hungering for a war movie, try "Tora Tora Tora" or "The Beast." They'll take you there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Purposely Misunderstood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've yet to see a serious review of John Milius' magnum opus, Red Dawn. For the most part, the liberal critics dismiss any discussion of its technical and dramatic strengths and instead focus entirely on the message. The thrust of complaints against Milius and Red Dawn amount to probably some of the most disingenuous criticisms in cinematic history. They critics argue that the audience should reject whatever Milius was trying to say (he's a conservative and board member of the NA) because the scenario is NOT REALISTIC and just a propaganda vehicle. I've always wondered how liberals, who draw the line at "it's bad" when it comes to understanding war, have the gall to judge the credulity of any piece in the genre.My main objection with the Left's attack on "Red Dawn" is their refusal to acknowledge that Milius' focus on the Wolverines represents only a snapshot of a far larger, broader story the remains ever present in the background. When critics complain about how incredulous it is for the Soviets and their Latin allies to attack a small town in Colorado, they purposely misunderstand the message Milius explicitly delivered through the Wolverine's conversation with Col. Tanner--these kids are only a small set of actors in a much larger war.It doesn't take that much of a mental exercise necessary to justify the period's well thought out belief that the Soviets could exploit their adventures in Latin America to invade the United States. Between Vietnam and the "nuclear freeze" movement, right before the Reagan build up, the West was essentially in retreat throughout the entire globe. Whether or not the Soviets could've succeeded in this gamble is another debate, but "Red Dawn" is a story of extraordinary times and circumstances albeit with careful attention to the real world.Even so, the focus on the realism of Red Dawn's background story is an attempt to get away from the really other stunning aspects of the film. You may disagree with the conservative themes in this film, but one thing John Milius does very well is let his views flow naturally from the experiences of his characters and the realities of war. There is no Rush Limbaugh avatar reaching into the film to preach through Patrick Swayze or Harry Dean Stanton, something Aaron Sorkin can't help but injecting into the endless banter that has become staple to the "The West Wing."The most clever critics realize that thematically Red Dawn is a success, so they go after the acting -- after all, that's where half of Milius' conservative propaganda is coming from. Yet more often than not they dismiss this important part of the film's success without a single attempt to specify their objections. You might ask what people should expect in the way of expressions and dialogue from high school kids who've been conditioned into guerillas , and I can't say that the kids in the "Lord of the Flies" featured the timely emoting that we see from say Swayze's character when they first arrive in the mountains. The terse, yet clearly emotional and meaningful chatter between the Wolverines is strikingly credible, and surpassed only by Harry Dean Stanton's powerful performance as a Midwestern blue collar thrown into a detention center and Ron O'Neal's slow yet well paced descent into disillusionment with his tiny slice of the war.There's wide agreement that the cinematics were decent given the budget involved and the technology of the time. The art direction apparantly was so successful that two CIA case officers were alarmed by the attention to detail given to the T-72 main battle tank mock ups. Over all, Red Dawn maybe one of the most original, well done pieces from the 1980s.</fullReview>

But I have to say that nothing I saw there could come anywhere near "Red Dawn" for improbability, crudeness or sheer knuckle-dragging dopiness. Maybe I see it this way because I am Australian, and therefore many things American have for me a bouquet of strangeness -- to mention only what seems an exaggerated idea of patriotism; not many Australians get misty-eyed at the sight of their national flag. Be that as it may, yes, the Soviet empire deserved to collapse, as eventually it did. But primitive movies like "Red Dawn" had nothing to do with it. Today, it has only curiosity value.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first half of RED DAWN is actually pretty cool. I'm gonna be honest: I love this movie's politics. The paranoia of the paratroopers and the gun registration, the all-too-real threat of Soviet invasion, it's a blast. A cartoon, sure, but probably as entertaining as a siege movie like this can be ("AVENGE MEEE!"). But then it turns into a war movie as the fresh-faced cast takes to the occupying forces guerrilla style, and it's here that the movie takes a dive. It actually tries to deal with serious issues like the effects of combat on a teenager and sets out to humanize these kids. Things slow down and it just starts to drag. The problem is that the ridiculous fun of the first half is all dried up and I just can't get behind the Wolverines even as their numbers dwindle. RED DAWN is the kind of movie where the hook is the memorable aspect. I still think the one-sheet poster is some of the most effective advertising of the time, and the movie's opening invasion moments are its best. But even at 90 minutes, it's kind of a slog after awhile. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Red Dawn is a lot better movie than the idiot critics give it credit for being.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I re-watched the original version of Red Dawn recently. I'm absolutely baffled by the vitriol this movie engenders among its critics. I've seen it referred to as everything from a racist, jingoistic "Ra, Ra, America" piece of Reagan-era trash propaganda to an allegory for the Afghani insurgency (which is far closer to the truth). The vast majority, I believe, completely missed the point of the movie. Either they never watched it or simply didn't pay attention.To call it a jingoistic bit of Reagan propaganda is a stretch, to say the least because the reason the "Wolverines" take up the insurgency is summed up once in the entire movie: "Because we live here!" That, in a nutshell, is the cry of every partisan, insurgent and guerrilla fighter the world over throughout history. They don't do it for "God, Mom and Apple Pie" or any of that crap. They do it because their home was invaded, their families were butchered and their enemy is relentless.Another jab I've seen is that somehow the movie portrays the Wolverines as super soldiers that never talk about, let alone experience, the horrors of war. So, somehow, Robert's descent into sociopathy, the deaths of Arturo "Aardvark" Mondragon and USAF Lt. Colonel Andrew Tanner, the implication that Toni and Erica were about to be raped (or were) and the eventuality of the war grinding down Jed are all completely and totally ignored.Does the movie involve Commies getting mowed down? Ayep, though I would note that its not front-line troops that the Wolverines usually attack, but troop convoys and rear echelon types....just like what happens in most guerrilla/insurgency campaigns. The one time they attack the Spetsnaz, its a well conceived ambush when the Soviets come blundering into the Wolverines encampment. Somehow, I don't think the critics actually paid attention. Red Dawn isn't a Chuck Norris movie.The other thing is that, unlike in other action movies of the era, the enemies in Red Dawn are not faceless automatons/robots to be blown to kingdom come. Colonel Bella is about as sympathetic an enemy as you can get even though he orders the deaths of the parents of the known Wolverines, minus the Mayor who is Daryl's father. The Soviet Spetsnaz commander Strelnikov is also sympathetic and clear headed. Most tellingly, he says he hates the hypocrisy that warfare produces, that euphemistic language of "containing the enemy" and so forth is a bunch of BS. Again, this is not something a mindless robotic enemy would say in a "Ra, Ra, Ra, USA! USA! USA!" movie. Anyway, for TL;DR - Red Dawn (1984) is a hell of a lot better movie than the then critics, then or even now, give it credit for being. Its a lot more subversive in its message than "Kill Commies for God, Mom and Apple Pie!" as some claim.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film from the first trailers I saw as a kid made this film to look really hardcore and a bit scary for a kid my age. The actual film though turned out to be just a little bit more than your standard action flick of the 80's and compared to others it was even a bit tame. The plot is way out there, as the Russians and Cubans are invading the United States on our home soil, apparently evading all our radars and things of that nature too. If you can get passed the improbability of this happening then it is an okay action movie. For me, the initial attack scenes were the best as the kids at their school have to get in the older brother's truck and make their escape to the mountains. From there it turns into a youth attack force movie where all the characters you get to know start being killed off and you are left wondering if any of them will survive. The cast is good, full of a lot of young talent and Patrick Swayze who is the best of this bunch. They add a couple of females to the mix later in the film, and there are some nice scenes involving people digging their own graves and stuff. I just find the movie feels a bit to long as the movie lasts under two hours, but feels a half hour longer. There are some good kills, but nothing that is going to be as good as a Rambo movie. So while it has its moments of being sort of good, it just fails to impress overall. Just a standard action film that is eh in areas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although Red Dawn isn't one of those movies that will change your life ( in fact it won't even put a dent it ) it is none the less entertaining in that down with our enemies - shoot em up way.For those of us who lived through the 80's and remember the final decade of the Cold War, we watch and shudder as Russian paratroopers land in our backyard, imprison our families and threaten our way of life.We also can't help but cheer as our heroes avenge America by destroying Russian tanks and planes, saving US citizens and shouting their battle cry, appropriately their high school team mascot ( the corner stone of all American experiences ).In the end Red Dawn is more a movie about teenage war fantasies than it is a a well thought politically themed war movie, but just the same it still seems to touch the pro-America chord that lies in all of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When war leaves the classroom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scene of this movie was killer. A bunch of high school students are bored out of their minds learning about historical battles, when suddenly paratroopers land on their football field and commence a takeover of their town. It's a poignant, moving, and pretty realistic look at what happens when America becomes a war zone. Like any resistance, this is just a group of kids who never planned to be soldiers. They were just going about their lives when everything they knew collapsed around them.  Whether this kind of invasion was ever plausible or not is debatable, and ultimately beside the point. The point is that it's not something we usually imagine happening here. What if it did?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no sense in trying to analyze the geo-political subtleties. This is movie is a fun, escapist what-if scenario, with strong performers, really challenging the entire coming-of-age genre. Of course, in reality, only ultra-right wing crazies could believe a premise like this - like Oliver North - and a film like this, at the time it came out, could be branded propaganda for neo-fascist Olive North style policies. Of course, some of the most fun 1980's films were no more than pumped up pro-military pro-war anti-commie propaganda pieces - like Top Gun, Iron Eagle, etc. Conversely, the best movies of the 1980's were anti-war war films, like Platoon and Full Metal Jacket. But, somewhere in between is a film that makes some points about the human condition, doesn't harp too long on self aggrandizing notions about right and wrong, and picks you up into a good action film - with a unique perspective.But all that aside, just turn off the analytical side of the brain, and enjoy watching our young heroes fight tremendous odds and save the day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Man's Freedom Fighter is Another Man's Terrorist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did really like this film a while ago until I read a review on the remake (which I have yet to see, and will probably wait until it is released on video) where the writer was disgusted at the fact that a movie is made where during an invasion of the United States (by North Korea of all countries) a group of Americans launch insurgent attacks against the invading army. I guess this is where the concept of one man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist.Back in 1984 when this film was made the whole idea of an insurgent being classed as a terrorist was not a big thing probably because the United States were not an occupying force in any country, however, twenty-five years later we have had two wars of aggression where the perils of being an occupying army have come to the fore. Okay, granted, here in Australia, attacks against occupying troops in Iraq and Afghanistan (as well as such attacks against troops in Somalia back in the early nineties) are not described as terrorist attacks but rather as insurgent attacks.Unfortunately I cannot compare the two movies, but I notice that in this one the occupying army is portrayed as being monstrous, but there again we see how our group of insurgents also fall down the slippery slope of monstrousness as well. It begins when one of them is encouraged to drink the blood of a deer after his first kill, and ends with them executing a prisoner and a traitor in cold blood. However, we do note that the invading force are portrayed as being less than ethical, particularly with the idea that for every one soldier that is killed, twelve civilians are executed.The idea of freedom comes to the fore in this film by comparing what it would be like under an occupying regime as compared to life in the American heartland, however while ones movements are controlled in occupied America (not that the Iraqis had such freedom because their freedoms were also curtailed considerably under the occupying regime) in free America there is still the fact that the only freedom that you have is that which you can purchase. If you have money then you have freedom however if you don't have money then you might as well live in a dictatorship because your choice is really only determined by what you can purchase.However, it is not like the Americans are any better than these imaginary enemies, okay, they may not have responded with indiscriminate killings whenever one of their own were killed (though it did happen) but there were incidents such as Abu-Graib, despite the media cover-up that it was only a few bad apples. Then there is the fact that prisoners were labeled enemy combatants so as to remove their rights given out by the Geneva Convention, and to add further insult to injury, the United States refuses to ratify the international criminal court, thus preventing any of their citizens from coming under that jurisdiction.The final thing that I must mention is the mentality in the film that the warrior must not cry. To me that is absolute rubbish and that is another means of destroying the humanity within you. We live in a culture where mean are not meant to cry because that is seen as a sign of emotional weakness. There have been books written about how such attitudes have served to undermine a soldier's humanity by denying him the basic right to grieve for the loss of a friend and comrade. However, in the end, if there is something that I would compare this movie to then it would be Lord of the Flies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Very Good, But Definitely Interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Red Dawn" is one of those what-if? films that really over-achieves for the most part. A group of teens escape their small town after it is attacked by the Russians and several other countries who have formed international alliances. Now they fight a seemingly insurmountable battle by themselves to re-take the country that is theirs. None of the performances are very good even though this film launched the careers of several actors (Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson, Jennifer Grey). The direction is adequate, but never does accomplish anything really special. Once again the screenplay is interesting, but never does come together as well as it could have. Overall a film that is watchable, but very far from anything really special. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie I hated it. The premise seemed right out of an ultra-conservative's fever dream and the "message" incredibly corny. But that fantastic score by Basil Pouledouris (who did the music for "Red October") kept me from reaching for the remote every time this film popped up on cable. And I've begun to view it in a totally new light.The film opens in a small town highschool classroom. Appropriate--we're about to get a "lesson" ! If you were a teenager in Afghanistan, how would YOU have reached to the Russian Invasion? What would it take to change you from an "average" soccer-playing, chore-laden kid into a bloody-minded Mujihadeen? And just how could this transformation have take place? The film actually handles this rather well, as we watch the "Wolverines" go from naivete to outright nastiness, their psychological evolution paralleled by that of their costumes -- team jackets and jeans giving way to scavenged military garb. The crude propaganda pumped at their hapless parent Internees, who show such pathetic courage as they warble a quavering "America" before the firing squad cuts them down, may seem "over the top" to a Westerner. But would it seem at all absurd to an Afghani--or other unfortunate National -- facing a brutal invader from a thoroughly Oppressive regime? These are the questions that make this film revelent, even in a post-Soviet, post-9/11 world. How do the distant events that we watch with such detachment on CNN, etc., really "feel" to the people who must live them?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an OK teen war film, that had a few powerful moments, but it left me feeling rather cold and the performances could have been better. All the characters are decent, and the story is watchable enough, plus it was amusing for me to see Swayze and Charlie Sheen so young in this film!. This really could have been a very powerful film, however, I couldn't find myself rooting for any of the Wolverine's, and the performances were rather wooden, however the setting gave me the chills!. The ending was really good though, and it had some pretty good war action scenes, however the dialog was pretty shoddy. It's quite graphic in some scenes, and C. Thomas Howell, while wasn't as bad as people said, still wasn't all that great either, plus Charlie Sheen was kind of wasted, and didn't have all that much to do, as this is mostly Swayze's film all the way. It's not very enjoyable to watch, and while Lea Thompson, and Jennifer Grey were nice to look at, they were also kind of wasted, however I dug the opening. This is an OK teen war film, that had a few powerful moments, but it left me feeling rather cold and the performances could have been better, worth the the watch. The Direction is decent. John Milius does a decent job here with good camera work, using a great setting, and keeping the film at a watchable pace. The Acting is OK. Patrick Swayze is good for the most part, however there were a few moments where he didn't convince me,and I didn't agree with a lot of his actions, still I dig the guy as an actor as he did a pretty good job for the most part. C. Thomas Howell overacted pretty bad here, but still wasn't as bad as many say, I didn't care for his character either, he was OK. Charlie Sheen is not his usual amazing self as he is pretty bad here as well, he had barely anything to do, and didn't speak all that much either(Charlie Rules!!!!). Lea Thompson is very cute, and did what she had to do adequately, it's too bad because she is a great underrated actress. Jennifer Grey is also cute, but had barely anything to do as well, she was alright. Harry Dean Stanton did good in his scene. Powers Boothe is also good in his role and brought his usual intensity. Brad Savage(Danny),Darren Dalton(Daryl Bates),Ben Johnson(Mr. Mason) all do what they have to do well. Rest of the cast are OK. Overall worth the watch. **1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

At the time this movie was made, the USSR was our bogeyman. If nothing else, this movie showed that no matter how bad things are, no matter how powerful the enemy, America will never submit. Red Dawn reminds me of "Green Berets" in a way; perhaps not the best writing or acting, and perhaps too gung-ho for most people, but appealing on a basic patriotic level.

I recall an interview with Milius where he explains that he based this movie on the games he used to play as a kid. Apparently many in USA felt a genuine fear of an invasion back then (whenever that was).That aside, the movie is playful and the villains range from faceless soldiers to really clever counter-insurgency experts . OK, so teenage kids are the main protagonists. Big deal. The action is neat even though the FX are slightly weak my modern standards.And besides, who's to say that USAnians won't fight as hard as any Viet Cong or Mujahedin when their nation is invaded by a foreign power? Frankly, I think they would. Politics aside, I actually think that if this move was redone today, it would reall be way worse than the original...See it. Don't take it too seriously. Eat popcorn.

Saw it for the first time since, last night with a friend, and yeah it's definitely dated, but how many movies like it are made in America now? The 90s were full of stupid teen comedies that have no point. Or really bad horror movies with no point.How many teen movies nowadays are as controversial to their day as Red Dawn was to 1984?

		<shortDescription>A great action film but more like propaganda than entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was probably the most exciting action film I've ever seen with plenty of gunbattles, explosions, and guerilla-like ambushes of Soviet soldiers by high-school kids hiding out in the mountains. In the film, in the midwest USA, the Soviet Union has invaded and Russian and Cuban soldiers are taking over. Many innocent Americans are killed and others are sent to "re-education camps", where they are told that "America is a whorehouse". A small band of teenagers, led by Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen, grab guns and hide out in the mountains for months, ambushing Soviet soldiers and acting as resistance fighters. This was very entertaining but had bad acting and attempted to make the Soviets look like they wanted to take over the world. Besides the propaganda and an unbelievably ridiculous story (Soviets traveling undetected all the way into Colorado???), this was a good action movie.

These kids are remarkably effective, and put a serious burr in the side of the occupiers, who, of course, then spare no effort to hunt them down. Some of the combat scenes are quite good! The film stars very young Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, Jennifer Grey and C. Thomas Howell, all of whom turned out to be huge stars. I think they all did a creditable job, even as young as they were in this film. Overall, I find the film to be very entertaining and pretty well executed. I gave it a 7.</fullReview>

This was before Gorbachev and Glasnost; WWIII was going to happen whether we were prepared or not. In retrospect, it is easy to criticize the film as "impossible."

		<shortDescription>A cut above the rest - which ain't saying much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*********************Spoiler Alert************************ Much of the technical criticism mentioned by others of "Red Dawn" is justified. The notion that a group of untrained teenagers could take on even a poorly motivated army like Cuba's or the now-extinct Soviet Union's is not credible. The best part of the movie is watching the teenagers struggle with the morality of guerrilla warfare. I give it a 6 out of 10.But "Red Dawn" is well worth watching for one reason. It represents one of the last movies Hollywood put out that did not look like a joint venture between the Democrat National Committee and Code Pink.Even in 1984 the "blockbuster" mentality was already changing the face of Hollywood. Every year lefty movie studio moguls churn out brain-destroying fare such as "Syriana", "Brokeback Mountain", "W", "Rendition", "Stop Loss", "Che", "Good Night and Good Luck", and "Redacted" by the truckload. All of these movies were wildly popular with critics, and not a few won major awards. All of them (not coincidentally) flopped at the box office. If it were not for blockbuster movies like "Spiderman", the "Star Wars" series, "Transformers", and the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy riding to the rescue like the cavalry, Hollywood would require a Federal bailout of epic proportions (pun semi-intended).But in 1984 there was still some independent thinking to be had in Hollywood. If nothing else, "Red Dawn" is interesting to contrast with "The Day After", another move that came out at roughly the same time. The latter is memorable for the anti-American paranoia that was rising in power and influence and would soon swamp Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It did make me ponder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised by this movie being classified as an action movie. I suppose that it does have a lot of explosions and gunfire and dying, but I have always thought of action movies as ones where the "action" is.. glorified, if not glorious. When an explosion happens, there should be someone flying through the air in a tuxedo, when buildings fall down someone should be yelling "SHIIIIIT!" and when people die it should be after they've choked out their dying threat or quip. This movie's explosions and gunfire just make people fall down and die, and it's always expressed how much they don't want to, and often what it does to the psyche of the person who did the exploding or gunfiring.I'm not American and I wasn't alive in 1984, so there might well be a lot of contextual meaning that I missed. I don't particularly like war movies as a genre, because I can imagine well enough for myself that it's horrible. Setting the movie in a fictional war made me keep watching because I didn't know what the outcome would be. There was also enough personal story to keep me watching to find out how the characters, as well as the war, would go."They fought here alone; and gave up their lives, so that this nation shall not perish from the earth.I did wonder, several times, is it really worth all that? The kids just kept killing people, and more people got killed because of that, and by the end most of the Wolverines were dead too. To keep America America. Now I missed the start so I don't know if the invading forces were planning to do terrible things with the country. But I could not see that the idea of "america" was worth all of the violent deaths that I saw in this movie. I also didn't want to write off the story that the Wolverines had lived through. So I thought again, and now I wonder if maybe the idea of many differently-ideal-ed nations are necessary, and that it is worth death-fighting to keep a variety of governments in the world.I suppose fighting for ideals rather than lives is one of those great heroic issues. I find it a bit interesting that a movie whose characters really don't seem to know (or address) what purpose on earth they're fighting for seems to end up having that message of nationality.Actually, scratch that. They DO address that question. Patrick Swayze's character shouts (at the execution of the Russian and the turncoat) "THEY DON'T LIVE HERE", or something similar. The instinct of "you're on me, get off" is the strongest motivation for partisan fighting on offer in this movie. That it's expressed in so few words and with such simplicity, and that there's no treatise on American ideals spoken or read, makes the ending rather hollow to me now. It leaves "this nation" as not a people unified under whatever bill or constitution or dream it is that's supposed to make America American, but as a load of people who just happen to be there, who've been there for some time, and don't want no- one on their land, y'hear? And that is unfortunate, seeing as how modern America has the history that it does. It maybe also makes the story as a whole more understandable and relatable.I did find Red Dawn rather watchable. And setting a non-fantastic genre movie in a fictional war is very endearing, to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was pretty controversial when it came out because it bucked the theme being touted by liberal politicians in 1984. They wanted the US to engage the Russians and make nice to them, while President Reagan had the nerve to call this evil empire an "evil empire". The public seemed to either hate the movie for having the affront to show a Communist invasion of the USA or conservatives thought it was all cool and somehow prophetic. I went to see it, in part, just because I wanted to irritate liberal friends by telling them I saw this movie! After all, it was just a movie! And, a fantasy involving a right or left-wing plot is certainly fair game (though critics at the time BBQ'd the movie and branded it as evil).Now as for the movie itself, if you remove all the political baggage, it is a decent but far from great film--and people on both extremes politically should bend a little--the film ISN'T evil nor is it the greatest film ever made! Instead, it's a fantasy first. And, secondly it is kind of fun to watch but pretty brainless--having lots of action scenes but the dialog and acting is right out of a teen movie! Judge the film on its own merits, not just politics. Those who give it a 1, do so for their own agenda as is the same with them that give this mediocre film a 10!

It clearly demonizes the Soviet Union as some sort of boogeyman and trots out some really funny patriotism goofiness, but also sends mixed signals about how the kids fighting get dehumanized yet lionizes them in a somewhat disturbing fatalistic way. Personally I think it is that element that is most unpleasant and the real problem.Hey kids, the idea is to stay alive, not die for a "cause" in a blaze of glory! Basically if the notion of a movie about teenagers forming an effective military unit fighting against overwhelming odds while living in the mountains sounds like something you might enjoy you will probably like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Russians invade our country, keep in mind that this film was made in the 1980's when the cold war with the Soviet Union was still going on. This was such a realistic national nightmare not so many years ago. Think of the Cuban Missle crisis and the "duck and cover" drills that they used to have for school kids and the warning that the Commies were only 90 miles off our shores. Then unknowns Patrick Swazye and Charlie Sheen got their starts in this film and to me at least it is chilling to watch, the scenes of the Russian soldiers invading and killing our people and taking over. It is a nightmare that should wake up all Americans and make them realize how precious their freedoms and liberties as Americans and as human beings are. We ARE the greatest country in the world and its almost as if our kids today are brought up to be ashamed of it. We cannot say the Pledge of Alliegience and pray in school anymore (we did that without a thought when I was in school) and its all because of liberal idiots, the same kind that despise a wonderful film like this that makes uS THINK! These kids take up arms and fight for their country! What a wonderful thing! This film should be required viewing in schools as far as I am concerned. It was made during the wonderful Reagan years when Americans were proud to stand up and be counted again! This was when you had the Rambo films as well. Patriotism is what this film preaches and I give a hearty AMEN! Powers Boothe and Ben Johnson, two fine character actors are also in this film and its always a pleasure seeing them as well. Boothe has won an Emmy for playing the title role in the 1980 tv film "Guyana Tragedy: The Story Of Jim Jones" and yet his career never took off the way it should have after such a remarkable debut. He gives a wonderful performance in this film as a shot down Air Force pilot who befriends the kids and helps them fight the Russians. There is a great scene where he talks of his shootdown and the developments in the war. He brings a perfect mixture of toughness, cynicism and weariness to his role, especially when he talks in another scene about the realities of war. Boothe should have won an Oscar for best supporting actor for his role in this film. The Berlin Wall fell, The "evil empire" collapsed and Communism is basically just a word our kids read about in their history books today. This film, however, looks at what "might have been" and it is still a terrifying message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Passable version of putting the 'heroic resistance' film into the mainland US. Some very good moments and some very bad as well. Altogether a bit too jingoistic for the post cold war world but relevant to the attitude of the times.What man has not put themselves into such a position (at least in their thoughts). Good to see the use of women as resistance fighters too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Occupied America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, starring Patrick Swayze, ominously released in the benchmark year 1984, either came out after its time or before it by almost 30 years, dependent on your perspective. As a movie about a Russian invasion it fits in a genre of 1950s era bleak futurism of the prime time of the US's cold war with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. As a movie about a determined resistance against a technologically superior occupier, it anticipated the US's dilemma in Irak by equal distance.At time of its release the prospect of the US defending against an occupation was nihl; the circumstances under which a major foreign intervention might be undertaken were to far beyond the horizon to be foreseeable. Certainly President Reagan regarded the cold war adversary to be an Evil Empire; few others did.Yet this is a film that transcended its genre and the test of time such that it might be taken as a metaphor for the war in Irak.There are some points of realism in the film: the brutality of the initial invasion much like the much bandied shock and awe as the US media glorified the initial incursion into Irak and the kinder and gentler approach taken by the second Soviet commander who tells subordinates the farmer doesn't kill the pig because the horse kicked him in the mouth. The soviet's second commander sounds much like General Petraes who tells us we have had incremental progress however imperceptible. The exploits of the resisters in this movie are not unlike the dreary reports of US reverses whenever some news leaks out of Irak.Given the extreme sensitivity inside the US today to the very hint of criticism of the war in Irak, I'm surprised this movie is allowed to be shown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie (Spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all you must take into account the time period when judging the special effects and acting skills (not a whole lot of "great" acting in the 80's). That being said this film was ahead of its time and thought provoking. It's a fantastic "what if" scenario that at the time seemed possible and in view of recent events is actually more possible today. In a time where the indoctrination of our young people toward communist appeasement tendency's; this should be required viewing for all people in the public school system. The premise of how the Mayor turns his own son in to be "bugged" as to find the others is particularly chilling to me as this precedent seems very prevalent to me. The Mayor in the town, cooperates, colludes, and attempts to appease the invaders in this film as a coping reaction and does severe harm to all involved. It seems an accurate reflection of current mind sets in some leadership circles. If you doubt that there are those who would attempt such a thing (if they had the resources) then you are badly mistaken. Of course it sets a perfect storm scenario and while not a probable outcome it is plausible. If you are a fan of 24 you will enjoy it and identify with its message.</fullReview>

But what's good about it, is the premise that some American teenagers wouldn't just take the loss of their freedom lying down! (This might be considered a spoiler, but it's only a very mild one...) The high-school team, the wolverines, becomes a freelance commando team, the wolverines... Yes! And the scenes where they have to decide just who they are, morally, while they kill and are killed...

		<fullReview>5.6? 5.6? Is this what the world has come to? One of the greatest movies to be created receives a 5.6? There is something wrong here.Red Dawn may look like just some war movie first sight. It's actually about the importance of family and fighting for that family. The movie's spectacular theme motivates the film and the movie turns out to be superb.It is your average school day. History class. A very boring class. However, for this class it won't be boring. Paratroopers drop from the sky and begin shooting them all. The scene is very disturbing but very realistic. That could happen to any of us.As the movie moves on, a group of teenagers whose families have disappeared after the raid, they hide in the woods and form a brotherhood known as "The Wolverines". The movie depicts the violence of war and how invasions are actually played out. The attacks they use are just plain awesome and unlike other war movies, this movie is actually not afraid to kill off many of its main characters. The emotion raised from betrayal, death, and just striving to live to see their families is very overwhelming to the point where you are emotionally disturbed and saddened.The extraordinary movie is only enhanced by the performances. All of the stars of the film actually give incredible performances, and their stardom doesn't get in the way. This is what movies are about.5.6? Pop the movie into your DVD player, watch it, read this review, and maybe you'll realize how spectacular this film is. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry, kids, you had to be there. In the 1980's, even those of us who hated Reagan, and that was a lot of us, really weren't here to take any s%&amp;t off anybody, most especially those third-world wannabees in Russia. So a movie like this that had a lot more real-world hitting power than say Rambo's BS, was much more like the real thing. First of all, ALL successful guerrilla wars are fought by high-school age or younger fighters; second, there are some way-out moments in this flick that are well worth seeing. Need a lesson on PERSONAL ETHICS? Try out the scene where the cadre finds out one of its number has been going into town and has agreed to swallow a tracking device. Want to know how you treat an adversary after a real-world fight? Try the scene where the cadre captures a Russian soldier who asks about the Geneva Convention. How about brotherly love, which ends the film? The scene where the boys find one of their dads in the concentration camp, can't bust him out and know he'll be killed is spine-chilling. Speaking as a peace loving hippie type, and someone who detested the Reagan Era, this movie worked. In closing, after you've seen this movie, shout with me: WOLVERINES! With due respect this film kicks ass from beginning to end. But the original teaser was incorrect: we were invaded by the British in the War of 1812 and they kicked our asses AND burned the capital and the Japanese inhabited Alaska during WW2.See this movie. It was Ron O'Neal's last major studio film. And look for the line "Matt! RPG!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would likely consider this one of the worst, if not the worst ever movies that I have ever watched. The premise and all it's supporting occurrences is almost nearly as ridiculous and impractical as the woodsy headhunter murderers in the Corey Feldman/Meredith Salinger movie, Edge of Honor (a movie quite similar to this, minus about twelve kids).Here, we have the invasion of Russians in a small American town. The plot is forgiveable and expectable given that it was obviously made during the cold war. But here, a bunch of dumb high school kids ban together to fight off this relentless army of Russians. And they're so cavalier about it like somehow preperation on the football field had prepared them for this day of battle. And there's really no point, other than being nauseatingly super-patriotic (and in this day and age, that's an attitude I can very much do without). A bunch of 80s teen superstars, many of which looked like their kids were in high school, were placed in this star vehicle that had zip story. And it just goes on like that for a little less than two hours. It was the biggest hambone I've ever seen. And I hope never to see it again. It is, as they said in "Cannes Man," so bad that even people viewing it on an airline flight wanted to leave.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone's John Rambo (a psychotic, shell-shocked Vietnam vet in the original film, is transformed into a flag-waving hero in the sequel) was able to go back to Southeast Asia and "correct" history by decisively (and single-handedly) winning that messy ol' war on behalf of America. Red Dawn is a paranoid cold-war cautionary tale that presents us not with a rosy alternative past, but with an ominous vision of the future, metaphorically plopping a piece of Russian-occupied Afghanistan into America's back yard. In this celebration of the Second Amendment, storm troopers from the Evil Empire descend upon the inadequately defended United States and hold America hostage. Stealthily avoiding the invaders, a motley group of red-blooded, small-town, gun-toting teenagers go underground to form the Wolverines, a guerilla resistance squad dedicated to making those Russkies rue the day they parachuted onto U.S. soil. It's a darn good thing those kids had the right to keep and bear arms, huh! Written and directed by macho filmmaker John Milius, the self-described "Zen fascist" who also co-wrote Apocalypse Now, as well as the horrifying shark story Robert Shaw tells in Jaws. The cast includes Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson, Jennifer Grey (a few years before she and Swayze took up Dirty Dancing), Charlie Sheen, Powers Boothe, Harry Dean Stanton, and Ben Johnson. Red Dawn was a commercial success, although audiences invariably split into two camps, finding it either patriotic or appalling. Whatever your verdict, the film remains a telling reflection of its era</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The chuckleheads on IMDb who think this film is "awesome" are the reason western civilization is in decline. Of course their sins can be forgiven.. if perhaps they are only 18. When Red Dawn came out in 1984 I was 17, thinking of joining the military with my own subscription to Soldier of Fortune. I was gulible and naive and Red Dawn had a real impact on me. It seems bizarre now but for some reason I thought that the possibility of Cuba ganging up with Nicaragua to invade our southern border seemed plausible. Instead of the military I chose to go to college that November I had just turned 18 and I cast my first vote for Ronald Reagan on the strength of the delusions of Red Dawn. I decided to major in history and political science and it didn't take long until I realized just how misguided and wrongheaded I had been. My advise to the champions of this film is to open a history book and lean about American Foreign Policy or short of that rent the Erroll Morris film "The Fog of War". Like I said it's fine to like this film if you don't know any better but alas it's time to put childish thing away. PS. this review deals with the political messege of Red Dawn it would take many more paragraphs to lay out the aesthetic faults of this dog.</fullReview>

I just came across this as I was reading about the German resistance to the Soviets. I think some you got this right in pointing out this was a movie, meant as entertainment, and not a documentary. It is enjoyable as the story of resistance fighters taking on, and defeating superior forces.

If the Soviets were to have invaded, why would they take over a small town in Colorado? The film starts with some hypothetical stats on how the Soviets were taking over the world, Nicaragua, Cuba, etc. Well, long, long since we've all learned that the Soviet "threat" was always so overblown as to be absurd.In short, this flick is a must for the teen, survivalist redneck, but as to substance, it's about as substantial as "Battlefield Earth," with John Travolta.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now that the right wing efforts to sell the US to the Dubai corporation, Halliburton, through media con-jobs from Rush and Fox Noose are suffering a set-back, it is possible to provide honest appraisal of this film once more.John Milius, who was drinking very heavily at the time (I think he spent some time in rehab a couple years later), basically had a nightmare and put it to paper and came up with one of the absolute WORST scripts in history, full of one-dimensional characters based on some bad comic book from the 1950s, spouting dialog a sixth-grader would be embarrassed reciting ion a school performance of some gangster's version of "Peter Rabbit." He directed it because nobody else would. Really, really, really, really, really BAD. However, for some right-wingers (many of whom are insecure about their lack of education, and who distrust literacy and reasoning), it did provide a "rally 'round the flag, boys" kind of group-grope feel, similar to what the Brown Shirts used to get at their gay group-sex parties in Nazi Germany during the early '30s, I suppose.There's not a single trace of realism in the whole picture, and nothing and no one to care for. It's just a wet-dream for right-wing paranoids. Skip it or see a psychiatrist.</fullReview>

This movie succeeds on more levels than it gets credit for. It has been downed for its unrealistic nature, but anyone who has spent time in the mountains, and around the people of this nations heartland see it for what it is. It is an instruction on how small partisan groups can and would fight in the time of national emergency. Historically like circumstances happened in Russia during the German invasion, as well as Vietnam and largely any conflict of the modern age. Who are critics to say that the people of the United States would not be capable of such resistance? A principle misunderstanding that I have seen about this film stems from the fact that people do not understand that the Wolverines are not fighting, except for their ill-fated trip to the front lines, anything better than garrison troops. One should note once the true Russian Army comes on the scene, the Spetsnaz Airborne, things radically change for the main characters. People should view this film with a critical eye focused on what they would do in the same situation. Would they roll over and give up or would they fight. I choose to fight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What was that irresponsible lunatic John Millus thinking off, when he made this crass insulting flag waving nonsense back in 1984. It is totally racist right wing libertarian propaganda about the soviet union's threat to the west- which in reality was non existent. John Millius has made only two great movies the underrated 70s gangster picture Dillinger and Arnie's big break Conan The Barbarian. Then he made this masterpiece, did Karl Rove or Donald Rumsfeld co write the screenplay ? This even makes Invasion USA or Rambo First Blood Part 2 look like a Michael Moore/ Morgan Spurlock film! Those two films are utter crap, but they are enjoyable crap and they can't be taken seriously! Okay Red Dawn's very laughable and dated now. But the absurd premise of Soviet troops invading bible belt America, has to be seen to be believed! The only scary thing now is Patrick Swayze's &amp; Charlie Sheen's 80s mullets!! This film has only relevance to militia mountain men in Michigan, Montana or ultra Conservative fools in Texas.

Patrick Swayze is urgent, Charlie Sheen is nutty and looks good in a Russian hat. C Thomas Howell plays a white boy advisedly as he is white (this is before Soul Man). The boy who was Danny Glick in Salem's Lot plays a whining boy called Danny although this time he isn't a vampire. Ben Johnson makes badly written dialogue sound fine. Harley Christiensen was typecast AGAIN as 'man on pole'. Lois Kimbrell as Mrs Mason presented some soup with a subtle poignancy and it was good to see the Meisner brothers reunited as Russian Tanker 1 and 2.

		<shortDescription>Communist attack on American soil in the early 80s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Milius' "Red Dawn" (1984) details the somber adventures of a group of Colorado youths who flee into the mountains when communist paratroopers storm their town. Patrick Swayze plays the leader of the group and Charlie Sheen his brother. Other youths are played by Lea Thompson, Jennifer Grey, Darren Dalton, C. Thomas Howell and Doug Toby. Powers Boothe is on hand as a pilot who joins-up with the youths while Ron O'Neal plays a Nicaraguan officer who becomes war-weary. Ben Johnson and William Smith have small roles as an aging American and a hardcore communist respectively.You can tell that "Red Dawn" took a lot from 1970's "Hornets' Nest" about Italian kids teaming up with an American paratrooper to defeat the invading Germans. The main differences with "Hornets' Nest" are that the kids are much younger and the story takes place in Italy during WWII rather than America in the early 80s. Like that film, "Red Dawn" even provides a sympathetic enemy officer. Howard Hawks supplied the simplest definition of a good movie: "Three great scenes. No bad scenes." While "Red Dawn" doesn't have many (or any) great scenes it has quite a few that are pretty effective and memorable, like the execution of a traitor and communist soldier on the prairie. Unfortunately it has too many lame scenes or elements, like the overly gung-ho patriotic score (Basil Poledouris). Don't get me wrong, I'm as patriotic as the next person, but some of the patriotic trappings of this movie are absolutely eye-rolling. I consider Milius a great writer/director, as verified by 1979's "Apocalypse Now" and 1982's "Conan the Barbarian," but parts of "Red Dawn" are sickenly melodramatic or downright lame. Melodrama only works when you create well-defined characters, which isn't done here. Plus there's no build-up of suspense. There's an opening classroom scene with the kids at school and then WHAM the communists drop from the sky and the teens head into the mountains. Moreover, despite Milius' impressive resume some parts of "Red Dawn" smack of amateur filmmaking. On the good side, the film has a quality cast of up-and-comers and tried-and-truers. In addition, the remote Western locations are great, there's a lot of action and a few of the melodramatic scenes show glimmerings of greatness. The film runs 114 minutes and was shot in northern New Mexico, just south of Colorado. GRADE: C+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sat down and watched this for the first time in 16 years, and was pleasantly surprised. Yes, it's bloody. Yes, it's violent. Yes, the cast is not all on the same playing field, but the message of the film is exceedingly simple: Don't get complacent.Some of the film is a little chilling in light of Sept. 11, but there's enough silliness to keep you from getting too depressed. 1. You can laugh at the clothes, 2. You can laugh at the dialogue, and 3. You can laugh at how homely they managed to get Jennifer Grey and Lea Thompson to look. Also, keep in mind that this is from the screenwriter of Magnum Force and Apocalypse Now, and the screenwriter/director of Dillinger and Conan the Barbarian. Kevin Reynolds wrote the original screen story, which was supposed to be a sort of preteen Lord of the Flies type scenario (which would have been interesting, but we'll never know how it would have turned out; oh wait, there was that horrible remake of LOTF in 1989), and has since gone on to such illustrious classics as Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and the unforgettable Waterworld.Now that you know what you're getting yourself into, throw yourself in with wild abandon and enjoy yourself watching the antics of a gun-happy (yes) C. Thomas Howell, his hunting expert buddies, and the whiny kids who just happened to come along for the ride. Don't worry; they're disposed of in an appropriate manner. Enjoy the low budget constraints of substituting New Mexico for Colorado, and a surprisingly sympathetic Cuban communist leader. Just don't take any of this too seriously. It can't stand up to that kind of scrutiny. The guerilla raids of the "Wolverines" are sometimes laughably implausible, but it doesn't matter. Plausibility went out the window on this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In truth? No, this movie is as far-fetched as Star Wars. That aside, I love this movie. It wasn't for the acting or the action or the plot. It was because I suddenly began to ask myself the question...would I be able to take up arms against a foreign power with a few friends and honestly expect to make a difference? Would I even have the courage to do so? Food for thought.Needless to say, I would speculate that such a time is not in the near future. But this movie stimulates such a thought, and gives rise to a fantastic and entertaining span of 100 minutes. The final fifteen minutes or so, when members of rebellious "Wolverines" begin to be overwhelmed by enemy forces were especially compelling. Would I be able to go on after seeing loved ones killed? Wouldn't I want to protect those that were still alive? The final scene with Charlie Sheen and Patrick Swayze was a tearjerker. It was the closest to "acting" the movie came. The acting in the movie was superficial at best, at yet I could somehow feel a fraternal relationship in that scene which tore at me. See for yourself. Absolutely one of the best of the '80s. If you're in the mood for a shoot em up, but want a movie infinitely better than Rambo, check this out. Although, Die Hard is a better bet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have heard some quick dismissal of Red Dawn as cheesy, but i still maintain that it's a good film. The relationship between the young guerillas is strong, and the transition from innocent footballers to hardened killers lamenting the loss of their innocence is very powerful. The execution scene is very strong in that sense.While the characters are pretty well represented, the tactics of the war are more hazy. For instance, it's not clear why the small town is attacked (although anyone familiar with D-Day, for instance, would know about miscalculated parachute drops), and two men essentially strolling into a huge garrison for the finale is a little hard to swallow. That aside, the action scenes are plausible (at least for a civvie like me) in that refreshing, ultra-patriotic way.It's very easy for me to understand a commmunist country attacking their capitalist neighbors. What better way to focus everyone's problems on something besides waiting in bread lines? For a nuclear version of this, check out Threads, a truly frightening film.Overall, Red Dawn's a good flick,with strong characters and a good patriotic feel to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Red Dawn:" Mirror of Society's Fears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>However silly the premise of Central American communist troops organizing well enough not only to hold their own country for very long, but to invade, and for a time hold, the much larger and well-organized United States, this movie still has serious value as an expression of the fear of such a scenario's realization. This movie mirrors the deep anti-communist, pro-American feeling with which so many of us grew up in the early '80's, and as a manifestation of this cultural trend, it is quite fascinating to watch again and reflect upon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating relic from the 80s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie as a teenage not long after it was released on video for the first (and not the last!) time. I watched a large part of it tonight on TBS, and while watching, I tried to recall my initial thoughts when I saw it as a youth.I do remember liking it as a teenager, though I also remember that I did find the premise a bit hard to swallow. (America placed in such a vulnerable position and without any real allies? And being overrun so quickly?) Still, there WAS still a threat of some kind between the two superpowers. Seeing people my age forced to flee, and then fight back for their freedom was something I'd never seen before - usually teenagers were characters in sex comedies. I suppose that's why this movie stuck so much in my mind, and I'd imagine myself in such a situation, fighting and killing those damned bloodthirsty commies!Seeing the movie again was very interesting. The action scenes are still good, the movie travels at a swift pace, the cinematography is impressive. I also saw signs that writer/director Milius, though right-wing in real life, wasn't taking everything seriously here. Witness the scene where a tank pulls up to a small gas station and we hear "ding-ding!"While watching, though, I was struck by my change of viewing, due to the end of the cold war. Did I really feel any kind of fear or threat? Of course, times are different now. But still...quite interesting to see how different your feelings are fifteen years later.It makes you wonder: In 15 years, how will we react to the politics of action movies in the late 90s, with our enemies now being Arab terrorist. Could we be thinking differently in 2014? Quite possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entertaining WW3 drama.Russia launches a surprise attack on and invasion of the USA. A small town in Colorado experiences this first hand when Russian paratroopers land in the town and quickly take it over. A small group of teenagers from the local high school, calling themselves the Wolverines, manage to escape into the mountains and start to fight back.Quite entertaining. Yes, it was made during the Cold War so is a tad propagandic and, some might say, dated. However, it is still relevant today to a degree, due to Vladimir Putin doing his utmost to restart the Cold War. Always good to see the Ruskies get their rear ends kicked.Much grittier than I imagined. Being centred around teens and thus aimed at teens I imagined it would pull its punches and present a Disneyised version of war, complete with empty sentimentality and idealised versions of honour, chivalry and the like. Was pleasantly surprised to see that it didn't go down this path. The scene with the prisoner and the traitor rams that point home.Plot is a bit basic and direction more focused on action than drama, so the movie is certainly no Citizen Kane. However, it has great momentum and is never dull.Main cast includes many stars-to-be: Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, Jennifer Grey (in her second feature film), Lea Thompson and C Thomas Howell. Swayze does well but is a bit miscast, looking to old for his part. Turns out, that, while his character is 18 or so, Swayze was 32! Supporting cast includes Harry Dean Stanton, Powers Boothe and William Smith.Good fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Drama/war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me tell you my political views. I have none. I am independent. I do not subscribe to the polarities of republican/democrat. Therefor this is an objective review, or as objective as one can be.Every actor in this movie gives an incredible performance. And it is a star studded cast. Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen (as brothers), C. Thomas Howell, Jennifer Grey, Lea Thompson, Harry Dean Stanton. The already good actors are finely tuned here for this epic war drama. There were several parts of the movie where the tears did jerk inside my eyeballs, admittedly. And it's a crying shame that so many people denied themselves the enjoyment of this movie from a sheer dramatic acting and cinematography perspective just because of some silly political views that you really have to search hard to scope out in this movie.Now, that being said, is the movie a product of its time? Absolutely. And that's what adds to the beauty of it (didn't see the remake and will not see it). But it also has many timeless characteristics. Brotherly love, the will to fight with heart and soul for your friends, family and nation. And the question marks it raises, like all good war movies. "Are we really any better than they are?"Enter this movie with an open mind or better yet, with no mind at all, and it will touch your soul. Period. The end.Have a nice day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Patriotic Movie, 10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure why people are criticizing this movie as propaganda, this movie is wonderful as far as I'm concerned! It's rather pathetic actually that people would criticize it like that. Russia at the time was a huge problem to us, and even is still to this day. It shows how communism/socialism is doomed to fail under every circumstance; and I love it! I'm a patriot myself, and I can relate to this movie at every turn! I loved the scenes where they were in the woods just surviving with hunting rifles; it made me want to be right there with them. It showed a great version of what would happen if this ever happened, and it's what makes America great. Every tough situation the USA had been in, we always come out on top. I would put this move in the class with other great American classics; such as Grease, and Saving Private Ryan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PG-13 Cold War Shoot-em-up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Commies invade Northern New Mexico subbing for Colorado, and a bunch of High School kids led by Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen must fend them off. Ridiculous right-wing paranoia makes for entertaining cinema in retrospect, making this a time capsule of the last serious years of The Cold War when America was starting to cathartically pump out action movies in which the anthropomorphized ideal of the stars and stripes decimates the Soviet army. Rambo II and III did the same.Pros:-Lots of action, very high production values allowing for very authentic looking Soviet equipment, lovingly captured during a few tank battles. These were the days before surplus Soviet T-72s made their way to American screens, so they had to build these and they look terrific. Lots of squibs, explosions, and excellent sound design to bring them to life.-The supporting cast is top notch featuring a great assortment of familiar faces and old pro's including Ben Johnson, Harry Dean Stanton, William Smith, etc.-It's pretty well-written considering it's just an 80's action movie. They do some pretty creative things with the buildup to making hapless teens into a fighting resistance movement. The villains are mostly nicely fleshed-out too and humanized more than I would have expected.-Great score by Basil Poledouris for the most part.Cons:-The action is mostly pretty comic book and lacks realism. We're asked to believe that a ragtag band of teens could outwit and out-shoot trained Russian and Cuban soldiers consistently and take zero casualties, even when grossly outnumbered. -A key scene in which one of the members of the group is exposed as a traitor and executed is handled extremely lazily, shot entirely from one angle, alternating between the master shot and a longer-lens camera for singles. The film never really recovers from there.-A lot of the performances by the teen actors are uneven and exacerbated by putting them in unbelievable situations. Swayze's delivery often comes across as awkward and forced when he's trying to be brooding and serious.-The best character in the film, Tanner, is unfortunately not around for very long at all.Conclusion? Best for viewing for history / war / military equipment buffs. It's not perfect by a long stretch but certainly one of the most memorable movies of the 80's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full of action, but lacks character development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched this classic after "Tomorrow - when the war began", which many reviewers claimed to be an "Aussie Remake" of Red Dawn. It's funny how remote the Cold War setting feels today ? and for a contemporary viewer it might be difficult to imagine the impact a socialist re-education camp in their home country on a U.S. audience during the 80ies.In Red Dawn you see a lot of atrocities, but oddly enough it didn't engage me emotionally like Tomorrow did, which is far more tame and kind of "politically correct" (at least in comparison to Red Dawn ?). I think it's because "Tomorrow when the war began" spends more time introducing the characters, who have clear roles ("the hero", "the sidekick", "thy pyromaniac", "the coward", "the religious", etc.), whereas Red Dawn cuts this to the bare minimum ? we're thrown into the action like the kids are, but if someone bites the dust, we've hardly come to know him and therefore care a lot less. Tomorrow also spends more time with the preparations for an attack, so the suspense builds up ("will it succeed?"), whereas Red Dawn jumps directly into the action. As a result, we see a lot of fireworks and shooting in Red Dawn, i.e. if you like an action-packed movie, Red Dawn is probably the way to go, but in my opinion a lot more suspense would have been possible.Concerning "political correctness": Red Dawn is very anti-communist ? the Cubans and Soviets are shown to violate the Geneva Convention. It assumes a scenario where the U.S. stand alone, encircled by enemies, left alone by all allies. This seems to be a right-wing point of view to me, on the other hand it is the only way to introduce an invasion scenario for the U.S. homeland. This whole background might be a reason for some scathing criticism in this forum. On the other hand: If compared to "Tomorrow when the war began" where the enemy stays anonymous in order not to raise any controversy, it kind of feels refreshing to see a clear enemy, even if it is a very stereotypical one. Red Dawn surprisingly even features a sub plot in which a Cuban officer is portrayed who develops more and more doubt about whether it is right what he is doing. Obviously, on the U.S. side there is no real bad guy, and during the resistance the hapless teenagers very quickly become experienced, ruthless guerrillas (even with the Che Guevara-like cape, heavy weapons and all, like from an defence industry advertisement). For an 80ies flick I felt it remarkable that the girls are shown as active guerrillas, on par with the guys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad dawning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red Dawn is a film that hit t.v just over three years after it's release at the cinema where I first saw it. At it's second viewing I was quite disturbed, about how easily lives were robbed of us fellow citizens. I don't really remember being disturbed, at my first viewing, it's run, only a week in Adelaide, would you believe. Too it's grim ending, in body count of our bratpackish mob, only sparing two people, left to continue the fight. This was thought provoking at the fact, of how much these American kids were willing to survive this horror hell, where they're stacked up against a insurmountable army of Russian soldiers, sickeningly remorseless in eliminated the enemy. The survival factor was the most frightening element in this film, when a group of teens take refuge in the mountains, after first watching their class mates shot down by enemy forces on their school grounds, where students are scurrying off left right and centre. Lucky Swayze pulled up in his ute. This brave if lucky group, hold out over a year in the mountains, surviving all kind of conditions, determined to defy these sons of bitches, outsmarting them with traps, gutting deer to drink it's blood as well as pillaging a fruit truck. I couldn't understand though, just after the madness, how our three mains went back into town, during the day, amidst enemy tanks, etc, some business's still operating, and also at night, visiting their loved ones, now prisoners, having conversations with them, through wire, without being spotted or shot. At times too, Red Dawn is unintentionally humorous. But not such is the cheap disregard for life, one scene, a huddle of Americans, shot down like cattle. One of the teen's fathers joins the Russian side, the son too, giving up his group, when things get more intense. Pussy. Swayze goes nutty at him. I always remember this defining Swayze acting moment. "You son of a bittttchhhhh!" C Thomas Howell as Robert, in not a bad performance, the most affected, who becomes gun crazy, just ends the betrayer. His own demise is memorable, his AK 47 against a chopper shooting out rockets, where's he's in open view. No I don't think so. This film overall, has a bleak and terrifying aura about it, as really, "How long can these kids last?". But this is what compliments it, as it makes us takes the situation seriously. It's a "this could happen" movie and "this is how it would go down" if in reality. But even though it comes across quite real, some moments powerfully strong in parts, it came disjointed in bits, too where the suspense got lost. Granted, Red Dawn is no flawless masterpiece, but is indeed a thought provoking watch, but I wouldn't feel right, saying educational.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it a masterpiece? No. Is it a Pile of Crap? Hell no! Just the mindset of the Cold War in a nutshell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before going into this movie, one must understand the time when the movie was made; 1984. The Cold War was still in full swing. People were still worried about the Evil Commies either invading us or Nuking us. This movie sums up those fears in a nutshell.The Movie is about a bunch of kids who decide to fight a Guerrilla War against the invading communist forces that are oppressing the people of their hometown. At first, the basic storyline sounds incredibly stupid and far fetched (even by cold war standards) and it starred several actors who were either already well known or later became well known.The dialogue isn't too bad (except the first few lines prior to the invasion) with some very memorable sequences and quotes (WOLVERINES!!!), and the characters are all well done; the kids themselves are believable and show emotion quite well (especially compared to it's 2012 remake). Heck, even the Communist forces are given a fair amount of screen time, with one of the commanders having seconds thoughts about WW3 by the end, (Something which is non-existent in the remake).The Action sequences themselves are quite entertaining and well set, especially concerning that these kids have no prior experience in warfare.However, the one thing that impressed me about this movie was it's attention to detail: All the tanks and firearms are correct (and if not, heavily modified to resemble the correct weapons/vehicles). Heck, even the Soviet Propaganda in the town during it's occupation is very believable.The only flaws of this movie are the fact that some suspension of disbelief is required (How are the kids able to slaughter and entire Spetsnaz brigade, who are among the best trained special forces in the world?), and that it's obviously dated (Most kids don't know what Communism is let alone the Soviet Union) and a few minor pacing issues.Overall, I think this is a pretty good movie that you should check out if you are a fan of 1980's action movies, cold war movies, or even any sort of action movie for that matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Say what you will about this flick, it's an example of an era...You can't really quite appreciate this film if you weren't around during the Cold War era. Most of us would like to forget what it was like; some of us have selective memories. The threat of nuclear annihilation was real. We lived with it hanging over our heads every day. Those of us that lived near air bases just assumed that if and when it hit the fan, we, and everyone in our towns, our family, our friends, would be gone.Generations post Cold War Era can only try to imagine what it was like. Try to let what I've just described sink-in for a few moments.Red Dawn isn't so much a flick about what could have happened so much as it's a flick about what we were afraid might. We can all look back now and laugh at it, critique it, disregard it.It serves as an astute reminder of a time we've since put behind us.Or have we ?Sometimes I wonder if the roles have been reversed; now our armies occupy distant lands; now our children are the occupiers.Red Dawn is many things, maybe that's why there are so many detracting views of it. To me, it serves as a poignant reminder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story to this movie has an AMAZING absurdity take on a "what if" scenario. But, I LOVE it (and would strongly recommend it to anybody)!!!The movie has ONE OF THE BEST opening scenes that I have personally ever seen. Which is, 'a peaceful morning and then suddenly invaders start parachuting from the sky and start taking the town hostage'.This movie has ONE OF THE BEST ideas I have ever seen in movie history. Which is, 'kids hiding out in the woods and using "guerrilla warfare" to kill the invaders, one-by-one (and taking the name of their high-school team: WOLVERINES!)'.One of the things that I thought was VERY POORLY executed in the film was: "the loss of innocence" for the characters. That is a VERY HARD thing to do justice to in films (and to this day - I have YET to see that). But, I would have liked to see more of an emphasis of the characters "loss of innocence" (because, they were innocent in the beginning and eventually decided to take an armed stance after witnessing the innocent blood spilt of their family &amp; friends).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, the Soviet Union really had the capability to land paratroops in Colorado in the 1980s if they really wanted to. The Strategic Defence Initiative really frightened the leadership and they did consider making a first strike while they still could. Our military power at the time, aside from our nuclear arsenal, was extremely weak. We had one airborne division; they had eight. The movie was really an American remake of "The Battle of Algiers" plus some elements of the Afghan war of the Eighties (when the Russians were bogged down there--ask your parents.) The most memorable scene of the movie is where C. Thomas Howell faces down a Russian helicopter gunship, an American helicopter made up to look like an Mi-24, which was and is basically a flying tank. Before we shipped a few thousand Stinger missiles to the Afghan rebels, those gunships were practically invulnerable.As a movie, it's pretty darned good. My Harvard-educated lawyer wife saw it for the first time last night and asked me to look it up. There aren't any "Rambo" characters in it. The guerrillas inflict some pain on the occupiers, but the occupiers retaliate big-time, and eventually hunt down almost all of them--pretty much like "The Battle of Algiers." "Algiers" is artier because it's in black and white, and was fully vetted by The New Left; "Dawn" has color and much better acting. The scripts of both spill over into purple (and politicized) prose sometimes, but both deliver the same underlying message: Don't expect to impose your own system on another culture by force. And it does not escape my notice that that is basically what we're expecting to do in Iraq and Afghanistan now. Maybe you should watch both "Dawn" and "Algiers".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A time capsule from the Cold War era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back during the height of President Ronald Reagan's popularity Hollywood produced a slew of all-American-hero-kills-the-Commies flicks, best typified by the wretched Sylvester Stallone vehicle Rambo: First Blood Part II. Red Dawn (the first PG-13 movie) was released in the middle of all of those and maybe that's why it gets vilified in viewer reviews on IMDb.com and gets a one-star rating in the info pop-up when it airs on cable; it's lumped in with mindless action flicks best left consigned to the dumpers out back of bankrupt mom &amp; pop video rental stores. Red Dawn details teenage boys who hide out in the Rocky Mountains after an invasion of America by a Communist army. The boys return to town and stunned by the oppression launch a guerilla war against the occupying troops. The boys take the name Wolverines, after their high school football team. It stars Patrick Swayze and C Thomas Howell, who had appeared together previously in Francis Ford Coppola's The Outsiders, and their performances here are not their finest work. Some adrenaline-filled action sequences are actually quite watchable.The movie is often lambasted for being unrealistic, but the situation presented is far closer to real life than Sylvester Stallone destroying the entire Vietnamese army with an explosive tipped bow-and-arrow. The Communist soldiers aren't presented as sadistic killers who invade America out of spite. And if nothing else, this movie evokes a time when young men in America fantasized about fighting a guerilla war, rather than our current war where fat losers slap a yellow sticker on their SUV as if that will stop a centuries old civil war in Iraq.</fullReview>

Patrick Swayse was in this with Jenifer Grey before their dirty dancing days.He does a pretty good job in it Jenifer hardly has any lines.Basically America gets invaded and a group of kids run away and hold out in the mountains and fight for there freedom. It makes you wonder what you'd do in the same situation.It gives you that warm fuzzy feeling you get from movies that make you feel patriotic.I think it's funny how people try to get so deep with it and I'm talking about the people who hate it and the one's who love it.It's not that deep people! It's silly I mean it'd be like someone watching Independence day with Will Smith and ragging on it and the message that it was trying to send or someone going on about it being a moving patriotic movie.It just isn't that deep, it's an enjoyable movies and that's it (Red Dawn not the Will Smith movie).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Red Dawn" just ran again on cable TV and I watched with renewed interest. Since we live in a completely different world 20 years after its release, the film makes for intriguing comparisons now that we're engaged in "The Global War On Terrorism." Today, of course, we're still stuck with the immigration problem that features in RD's plot, but the consequences in the age of WMD are potentially as great or greater than the bygone era of international Communism. While large-scale shootouts with Islamicists constitutes an unlikely scenario within our borders, there's no doubt that today's high school students will live with the external and internal threat for years to come. Those viewers who scoff at the use of personal weapons in the film are free (!) to suit themselves. But the height of irony is found in the fact that the US Army has issued cautions to Stateside soldiers, warning them against wearing uniforms in some venues because Al-Queda web sites have noted that American troops seldom go armed within our borders.Overall, an interesting example of a "message" film that remains relevant even long after the message has changed.</fullReview>

Your teacher goes out to see if they landed off target. "Boom." Your teacher's dead. Gun shots are being fired directly into your class. You just see one of your friends shot to death. For what purpose? Who are these people? You were just in class; learning, laughing, and talking. Now there's a race to the door. Some of the older brothers/sisters and parents in this small town are already at the school to pick up their loved ones. Where to go?Your homes are invaded by Soviets just like Nazi's invaded the homes of Jews in World War II. This is World War III. You get together some guns from one of your friend's father's. You gather up in the mountains; you watch the Soviets put your parents and your loved ones in concentration camps to die.A group of high school football players, with the knowledge of many guns due to hunting, choose to fight for their home, freedom, and family against all odds instead of fleeing to safer territory. The only question is, can they all stay alive long enough to take care of it? This movie is the greatest patriotic anti-war movie ever to be made. It shows you how people can deal with loss, cope with death, and try to keep one another alive.This is Charlie Sheen's war film. This movie was made 2 years before Platoon, and Sheen puts just as good a performance in "Red Dawn" as he did in "Platoon." Adding Patrick Swayze doesn't hurt either.Watch this film and see how you can unite with people you never dreamed of uniting with. Fight for your freedom when the time is right. Save all around.

		<shortDescription>Missing a few things..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First..it was and is an interesting movie. Enjoyed it the first time and still enjoy it. Besides a good storyline, you can actually learn some real russian and spanish from it (ok..maybe not very usful russian and spanish like "Look! An arrow! A steel arrow! There must be more around!" in russian). Like some people earlier pointed out, you get a chance to see some future stars in this movie.Second...even though it's been pointed out that the movie was made in the 1980s and right in the midst of the Cold War, it seems people still try to use modern ideology in criticizing the movie. It also seems that some people are not really watching the movie because alot of the gripes were answered in the movie. Here's some answers :-Russians all over the place : Watch again. In Colorado, it was mostly Cuban and Central American troops. There were few Russian troops in the area. -Russians got so far into the US undetected : Again, Powers Boothe's character explained HOW it happened..recap..USSR nuked the eastern seaboard and parts of the midwest (SAC, NORAD). The Russians held the East Coast while combined Cuban and Central American troops came up through Mexico and spilled into the southwest. In other words, US troops got outflanked because most were probably in Europe after the Russians and the Warsaw Pact countries ran across the Fulda Gap in Germany. -Hijacked airliners : Right...russians could never hijack an airliner..just like middle eastern terrorists could never hijack an airliner and crash it into a building. Actually, in the late 70s and early 80s there were a slew of hijackings, mostly by Cubans trying to get the US as well as others across the globe (Entebbe anyone?) - Jocks save the day : actually, rewatch the film. Patrick's character and his brother hunted in the woods. In small towns in the US, it's not uncommon for jocks to be avid hunters as well. -Sexism : I believe Jennifer Grey adressed that point in the movie...and yes, back then in small towns, (and even to this day) there were/are men like that.Simply, yes, it was a propaganda film (not the best) and trying to compare it to modern day ideals instead of the ideals of the day when it was made, isnt really a true review, but just a gripe. Just think...in 20 years or so, someone is going to say the Lord of the Rings triology was total crap, badly acted, scripted and the spfx were so mundane..yet it's up for lots of Oscars this year. Go figure..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* * * (3 out of 5)Red DawnDirected by: John Milius, 1984Reagan-era what-if scenario: kids from a rural US town escape to the Colorado mountains and become guerrilla fighters when Soviet and Cuban forces invade and World War III is brute reality. Famous (and infamous) for a shocking opening sequence that's impossible to shake off: foreign paratroops land outside idyllic American high-school and suddenly open fire. There's plenty of posturing and lame action sequences (these kids get a little too good at what they do) ? but that was to be expected (when the director/writer is John Milius). What is surprising is the amount of human depth the movie offers. And the lack of one-dimensional propaganda.Red Dawn also addresses loss of innocence and national identity, while establishing realistic characters. Morally it's not just patriotic and gung-ho bravado ? clearly evidenced by the intertwined and effective side-story seeing everything from the eyes of a war-weary Cuban Colonel (great performance by Ron O'Neal). A man who seems more disgusted and disillusioned than any of the civilians struggling in the country he is helping to occupy. The young cast is solid (Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, C. Thomas Howell, Jennifer Grey), and Powers Boothe adds a fitting dimension as an US fighter pilot who's path crosses the young rebels. Story by Kevin Reynolds (Waterworld). The beautiful "four-seasons" cinematography of the Rocky Mountains by Ric Waite coupled with the melancholic Basil Poledouris score add an almost epic feel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the blindly patriotic film you think it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RED DAWN was largely dismissed when it came out as yet another product of the Reagan America, where the blood of communists mixed freely with that of the unbelievers upon the altar of Christian, capitalist democracy. This just isn't the case. RED DAWN, unlike a piece of garbage like RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II, doesn't have cardboard heroes and villains, and it isn't a paean to the American dream or the sanctity of our way of life. It's about little, unimportant people swept up in extremely unpleasant events, trying not to chewed up and spat out by them. Sure, the premise - a Soviet-Cuban sneak attack on the USA divides the nation in half - might be dismissed as jingoistic and warmongering by liberals, but the fact remains that the USSR was an aggressive, expansionistic nation and our government spent 50 years preparing to meet the kind of attack mounted in this film. Pointing out that the Soviets were not led by nice people isn't right-wing dogma, it's just a fact, plain and simple, and too many critics use that flawed argument to write off this intriguing and disturbing portrait of the guerilla psychology and mindset. Kevin Reynolds, the original scenarist, has said that he envisioned this story as a modern-day "Lord of the Flies," with kids retreating into the wilderness and becoming slowly dehumanized by the rigors of guerilla warfare, and you can still see that original theme in this film.RED DAWN has some great acting, notably Patrick Swayze's terrific performance as Jed, the older kid who takes the role of leader of the Wolverines upon himself and at times finds it more than he can bear, and the always great Powers Boothe as a downed fighter pilot who finds refuge behind enemy lines with the Wolverines. Another highlight worth mentioning is the great performance of Ron O'Neal as Col. Bella, the sympathetic and war-weary Cuban officer who does his job competently and professionally, who doesn't like seeing his soldiers ("the enemy," from the viewpoint of the American audience anyway) get killed and who wants more than anything else to return home. All in all, not a perfect film, but a pretty good one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Red Dawn is a well-acted, fast-paced, and action-packed film...that's the good news. The bad news is that its premise is wholly unbelievable, even for the volatile time period it has been set.I don't want to get on a rant here, but the Soviet Union would never invade the United States, especially with Cuban and Nicaragan ground troops. If we were ever to have a war with the USSR, it would have been nuclear, because the Soviet Empire could have never beaten us in a ground war. And the United Kingdom deciding not to become involved...that is a tad trite, seeing that they are our staunchest ally.For a good fantasy picture, see Red Dawn. To what would really happen, see The Day After.</fullReview>

I swear all you and your liberal beliefs and new age thinking. It's so sad to see what the people in our country have become. Nothing but un American, un patriotic crying little bitches literally. But then again you probably aren't all true Americans in fact I know you aren't. I really hate all your stupid opinions on propaganda and political views blah blah blah. How about shut up and watch an entertaining movie for once. You people seriously are ridiculous going on and on about how much you hate the movie it's propaganda this and that. I mean wow what have people come to these days. It's really really sad. I mean the new red dawn vs the original, really? The new one is so horrible and practically unwatchable compared to the original but then again that's just about how every new movie is these days anyway. Classic movies are the best for a lot of reasons. Today everything is fake and cgi crap. Oh you don't agree with me? OK then just go back to watching all the new garbage they have out. I'm sure you'll love it. But if your old fashion like me and prefer older vs newer movies then watch red dawn 1984. It isn't perfect but It's a good entertaining movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was the war everybody was planning for.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red Dawn has endured a lot of criticism over the years including a lot of people who have posted reviews here on IMDb. I was a teenager when this movie came out, and the reviews at the time almost universally derided Red Dawn as a bloated, right wing war fantasy with an unrealistic premise.Let's set the record straight. If you remember the Cold War, you know that both the USA and the USSR spent decades planning, preparing and war gaming the scenario that plays out in this movie, and others. B 52s flew 24/7 to respond to just this type of attack on US soil. It's what we all were afraid of. We can quibble about the realism of the actual invasion or the inclusion of Central American forces, etc. But none of this lessens the fact that these were the geopolitics of the day. No doubt that a lot of the bad press for Red Dawn came on the heels of war movies with a post Vietnam point of view like the Deer Hunter and Apocalypse Now. Red Dawn does come off like a B movie actioner in comparison and has a viewpoint more in tune with a John Wayne WWII movie.When it was released, some people didn't accept the concept of a teenage guerilla force taking on the Russians, but the fact is- history shows that partisans and resistance fighters who fought occupation forces were very often women and children. Those are the people who have to fight when your leadership is captive and your regular army is defeated.With all that being said, you can look at Red Dawn for what it actually is- a traditional war yarn played with a lot of sensitivity from young actors. There's lots of familiar faces in this movie which makes it fun to watch now. Big Bill Smith makes an appearance half way through as Strelnikov, the Russian enforcer. Ron O'Neal and Powers Boothe get a lot of screen time. Patrick Swayze is Patrick Swayze, along with the rest of the future brat pack actors.You do get a type of Hollywood ending here. Although most of the Wolverines don't survive, we do find out that the USA survives intact and probably eventually wins the war. The recent remake doesn't have nearly the impact of the original Red Dawn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider watching "dated" films not a chore but an experience and an opportunity to view the world as it once was. They are time capsules, much in the way old Polaroids capture the exact spirit of the moment they were taken , and go on to have a life of their own, much like "dated" films do. But that doesn't mean they're always a very memorable or pleasant experience.John Milius' Red Dawn captures that time of paranoia and uncertainty when the Soviet Union was rapidly growing in power and the U.S. had "red fever," as they anticipated some sort of attack from the communist country and began persecuting those who held beliefs mirroring those of communism. Watching the film in 2012, when the "red scare" is long over and communism seems to be one of the more minor concerns in America, the 1984 cult hit serves little purpose, other than to just be a curious piece of history and the film that kick-started Charlie Sheen's career.Our story is set in Calumet, Colorado, where we open by seeing a history teacher instructing his class when Russian paratroopers land in the open plain behind the school and begin opening fire on the building. The students frantically escape after their teacher is killed, and several band together to head up to a local grocer to gather supplies. The leader is Jed Eckhert (Patrick Swayze), who very early establishes his dominance among the group of teens mainly because of his assertiveness and his grand ability to be brave and stable. His brother is the quiet yet more emotionally open Matt (Charlie Sheen), their close friend is the very emotional Robert (C. Thomas Howell), and one of the girls they meet along the way is Erica Mason (Lea Thompson), who shows that she is not your typical female hero. Together, they form a group called the "Wolverines," after their school football team, as they gather heavy artillery, weaponry, and food in efforts to stop the invasion of their country.I'm writing this review shortly after writing my review of the 2012 remake of Red Dawn and all I see myself doing from this moment on is reiterating the same complaints I had after seeing the facile, bland remake, meaning that film failed at its first immediate goal, which is to improve on the original. Thankfully, to get us through this long endeavor unharmed and somewhat moved, is a charismatic cast comprised of the easygoing charmer Swayze, one of the best "that guy" actors, C. Thomas Howell, the unpredictable Charlie Sheen, and the rough and tumble Powers Boothe as the Wolverines' main asset.Unfortunately, even this cast of champs can't stop Red Dawn's main problem, which is a cheap, underwritten script that shortchanges the characters in favor of action sequences and scenes of just plain uncertainty. It capitalizes on the idea that in 1984, people were fearful of the Soviets and their power and pretty much sat on the idea that people in the audience were thinking, "my god, this could really happen!" It wasn't until the Soviet regime fell through in the early 1990's did we look back at this film as nothing more than a nationalist, pro-America propaganda with goofy characters, a silly story, and unrealistic action.The film's prominent gimmick is an interesting one; war from the perspective not of controlling adults, but impressionable teenagers who had a normal day of class interrupted thanks to violence and a surprise invasion. This is one of those rare, on-the-dime ideas that could carry an entire film, but writers Milius and Kevin Reynolds prefer the easy way out, centering the storyline not on the characters but on the action around the characters which makes Red Dawn feel longer than it actually is. Having it rely entirely on the idea of a Soviet invasion only made its "dated" feel become more and more evident.NOTE: Visit my blog to see an analysis of both Red Dawn films to see which one I feel is the better film, http://stevepulaski.blogspot.comStarring: Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, Charlie Sheen, Lea Thompson, and Powers Boothe. Directed by: John Milius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not even remotely realistic, but still worth owning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoilers* I am a huge fan of Cold War "what-if" stories. This film is one of my favorites. Very little of it is realistic. Most of the prologue isn't even fathomable. The entire plot is built around some kids who engage in guerrilla warfare and manage to win virtually every battle they begin. Somehow they amass RPGs, limitless ammunition and the remarkable ability to use and maintain foreign weapons, are made aware of enemy plans in advance, don't deal with any medical problems (such as hypothermia, malnutrition, broken bones, or maybe the inevitable PTSD from killing people at point blank range), and take the time to scrawl "Wolverines" on every triumph, including a slide in a projector. Also there is the obviously liberal mayor who sells out some kids to protect his politically adept son! Then you've got the young Soviet soldier calling for God (in an atheist nation?) and all the other soldiers are careless beyond description and are emotionless humans. You know, as opposed to the same as soldiers the world over, kids doing the dirty work of their leaders.Most of it is laughable.But despite all this, it touches some nerves. The Soviet/communist threat was real. We (the United States and Russia) spent the better part of four decades on the brink of nuclear devastation. This film ignores that entirely (no nukes were used), but it still speaks to the fear of not being invincible, the same feelings that have been provoked in a 9/11 US. This couldn't be reflected any better than the fact that the operation that captured Saddam was called Operation Red Dawn.There's a little bit of hero in all of us, whether real or fantasized, and this film evokes those feelings, much like a superhero or sports victory movie. And while I consider this a Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn dream come true, like their books, it is FICTION and shouldn't be considered as a realistic possibility. So, enjoy the crap out of it. It's a great flick, one of my favorites from the 80s, with a notable cast and memorable dialogue. And when you've finished watching it, laugh a little bit about the irrational paranoia we all engage in sometimes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie, I think it shows a subject that is not seen a lot in American movies and should. This film being from MGM, there was a lot of money put into it. Like said before, the makers got the clothing and weapons from the red army right. I liked how there was Cubans and Nicaraguans as well as Russians. The action was top-notch for 1984. Some people said that the teenagers were like card board cut-outs. I disagree, i think u did see them change in character in many ways. Like when the kid shoots Daryl with the AK after finding out Daryl betrayed them. It shows how even tho they did not know too well how Daryl got caught, the kid shot him (his friend) This shows their hatred. another time when Lea Thompson hates Charlie Sheen for being i guess kind of sexist, but then when they separate she hugs him n all. I know this movie was meant to tell a story of a certain are in America. But i wish it was brought out in a more worldly view. e.g. Tells more about the background, the reasons why. Sometimes like when the pilot says to the kids "when u have two toughest kids on the street there gonna fight one day." I mean thats retarded, just a lame way to get around explaining y Russia invaded. That was the biggest mistake of the movie. Also i enjoyed how they showed the Cuban Colonal Bella changing throughout the movie. lol then the Russians are seen as cold blooded and fight to their death. They should have shown more about their invaders and there thoughts on it. i gave it a 7 because it hits the right spot many times but this area has so much more potential, wow if I'm ever a director I'm def doing a movie like this. ALSO if anyone here likes this movie and has playstation u should buy it, the game FREEDOM FIGHTERS, its in my opinion top 3 games of all time PS2. Soviets invade NYC, u become a resistance leader.. its awesome and the musical score is better than almost any movie u can name (except maybe star wars n bev hills cop)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Achtung: This is a very personal review for sure... Let me start with my perspective on this movie 16 years ago:1984 when I was fifteen years old, it came to our town. Germanpolitics back then were very careful when making clear statementsand very soft and weak while corresponding with other nation´sleaders. The only strength allowed was the enormous financialwealth of our country. By that time, many germans demonstratedagainst american missiles and there was a lot of discussiongoing on in the schools. Patriotism was something for the radicalunderground and the german guilt to me seemed to be a dailytopic... Still the silent majority of people, non-intellectuals, workingclass and small business people felt a lot different about thesethings. To me, this movie said it all! It expressed my hate for therussians invading afghanistan, my disgust for the public andpoliticians who back then seemed to be a bunch of weekbrown-nosed pacifists...Now, things are different and the picture is not more than an actionmovie, way too long to hold the tension over the whole distance...Still to me it remains as a symbol for these days, when politicswere a daily topic in my life...

		<fullReview>When I was a freshman in high school (1973-74), I spent a lot of time daydreaming, especially in English class. One of my favorite fantasies was that the U.S. would be invaded by some foreign power, maybe the Russkies, and that a group of high school students (led by some intrepid cool guy, like, oh . . . me, for instance) would have to fight them off using guerilla tactics and maybe secret underground bases. Of course, I would also have some really happenin' chicks on the team, all of whom would fall for me in a big way. After all, in this post-apocalyptic world, there would be no reason for any moralistic rules like no premarital sex, right? So anyway, we would fight the Russians using cool customized cars and bikes with machine guns and rocket launchers mounted on them, and would capture the bad guys' weapons and use them to attack the Russian bases. Man, I loved that daydream. . .Then I saw Red Dawn. They ripped off my whole idea! I'll sue! Hey, if Art Buchwald can nail Eddie Murphy for stealing Coming to America, I'm sure to win.Dang. I forgot to copyright the idea. Or even write it down.</fullReview>

I can't remember if it was my boyfriend at the time or me who selected it, but likely was the boyfriend because I despise war movies and violence.Nevertheless, this movie grabbed my attention and held it throughout. When paratroopers descend on an American high school, you care! The efforts of these kids and their parents to resist the invasion really hit close to home, so for those like me who are turned off by a premise like this, give it a shot. It will probably engage you.I cared about the characters throughout the film, and you will too, because they are pretty well developed for an action film.This film is the first time Patrick Swayze came to my attention, and I'm re-watching this film today to honor him, because I just found out he'd passed away in 2009 from pancreatic cancer. :(There's beautiful scenery, and I promise that even for war haters like me, it will activate your sense of patriotism and make you root for the defenders of the invasion.Oh, and please don't waste your time on the remake. I've seen it, and IMHO and the opinions of thousands of IMDb participants it is NOT as good.I also watched "Letters From A Killer" with Patrick Swayze starring, because I hadn't seen it before, and that's worth your time too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of My Favorite War Movies Now!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red Dawn is I found to be a fun and intense war movie as well as a good what if story As far as this movie goes I enjoyed it. I thought it was an interesting idea, the action was good, there are some fun characters, and it can be intense in places. However, there are some definite issues I have with the film as well. I have not seen the remake, so I cannot comment on that film.The story is set in an alternate reality where Russia and Cuba have invaded America. The story follows eight high school kids lead by Jed (Patrick Swayze). Their town gets invaded by soviet forces and their parent have been either captured or killed. These eight teenagers form a resistance called The Wolverines, which is named after their football team, and gives the soviets hell. They are also joined later on by a Col. Andrew Tanner (Powers Boothe) who joins their team for a little while.I have seen many war movies as well as TV series now. There are some I enjoy like Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers and others I did not care for like The Deer Hunter (yes I said it). Red Dawn I will say is probably one of my favorite war movies now. I like a lot of the characters like Jed and Colonel Andrew. Charlie Sheen is even in this movie playing Jed's younger brother Matt. Charlie looked so young in this and had such a weird hairdo that, at times, I could not even tell it was him. However, I liked his performance as well as the character Matt. The film also has some decent action scenes that will keep you entertained and even at times wish you were one of them.This film is in a way great vicarious entertainment, at least at some parts. Many of us probably fantasized once in our lives about forming a gang of rebels, blowing away enemy forces, and getting praised as legends for doing so. However, the film can also get quite dark in other places especially the end. This film does play into the tragedy of war and the effects it has on people and, in my opinion, it does it quite well. The film does not end on a triumphant note really. It was not ultra-depressing, but it was not the triumphant ending I was expecting.The film does have some faults though. Many of the characters do not get enough character development or screen time. This movie is more about the action and the tragedy of war than on character development, which is fault. Powers Boothe's character Andrew is especially underused. He shows up and joins the main group near the middle and is killed of like fifteen minutes later. I did not care for that because he is my favorite character in the film. Another minor fault is that sometimes the dialog and the acting, particularly from Swayze feels very clunky and unnatural.Overall, Red Dawn is a very underrated war movie and just an underrated film in general. If you are a fan of war movies then give this a look. For those who have seen the remake and see how it stakes-up to you. I've heard nothing but bad things about the remake so my guess is the original is much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I frequently use IMDb.com ratings to decide about watching movies. It is usually a very good gauge. But for whatever reason, I feel this movie is incorrectly rated, and I am disappointed that the first review/comment is so negative. Upon my 1st viewing of Red Dawn, years ago, it was very gripping/interesting. I feel it was/is very entertaining. I like action and Scifi movies. I knew then (and now) it would be unlikely/impossible for a Russian invasion like this to occur, but it's not ridiculously impossible. As a child, I went through the Civil Defense drills at school (get under desk/table, put head between knees). We knew then it was because of the Russian Nuclear threat. My school had a basement Civil Defense Shelter, I still remember the signs. So for me, how can this Russian invasion be so impossible? If you can get over that, it's highly suspenseful,entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Red Dawn, Stupid but Awesome Movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red Dawn was the Harry Potter of the 80's. But it's a different type of a Harry Potter film. It's a film where Ak47s and machine guns are wands, helicopters and MiGs as broomsticks, Colorade High School students as Hogwarts students, Nicaraguan soldiers as Slytherins, Cuban soldiers as Death Eaters and Russians as followers of Lord Voldemort.If you don't know what the hell Red Dawn is, then i'll explain it to you: Imagine if you're a dork who studies in a high school and gets teased by guys and girls cooler than you, and then one day a group of communist soldiers land and invade your country, then you run into the woods with a bunch of friends and guys cooler than you, then you create a gang, name it after your school mascot and then kick the commies a** until they leave your country and then: freedom! Yes, i know it sounds stupid, but it does make sense. Red Dawn was an awesome movie. Charlie Sheen and Patrick Swayze played Jed Eckert and Matt Eckert, which resembles Harry Ron, while Jennifer Grey plays the chick that also has a more Hermione-styled but with a femme-fatale thing going on. It's more like 2 guys and one girl kicking a** (Just like Star Wars and HP).The script was good. John Milius, who wrote Apocalypse Now, gave a good script for the movie. Although it has some flaws, it's still a good script. A liberal with a NRA ownership, Milius gave us a movie that makes us think.......very deeply................so deep..........that it makes you.............wanna take marijuana and smoke it.The acting was good, but only on the Wolverines (Americans, that is). Charlie Sheen, Patrick Swayze and Jennifer were terrific, although the Soviets acted like complete morons who don't know what the hell AK47 is.The Cold War seems to be over, but the threat of a communist country invading your country is not. That's why we need more movies like this.. So please, Cuaron, Spielberg, Tarntino, Lucas, please make movies like this! I BEG YOU!! Rating 8 out of 10 It has its flaws, but it's still a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great campy flick that captured the era with a lot more action than the normal brat pack movies of the 80s. Not propaganda, as some contend -- just a legit anti-communist opinion made entertaining. Folks in Cuba still can't watch it, even if they could afford a DVD. Obviously it couldn't be an award winning film, there was no same sex kissing, Hillary wasn't a hero, &amp; the commies were the bad guys... Haven't seen it since 9/11, amazing to watch and think about how the world has changed. The movie is a time capsule. A Soviet general made a comment in the movie that they (Soviets &amp; Cubans) would have to kill all the kids, "just like in Afghanistan." Interesting that in real life, the Soviet &amp; US reasons for entering Afghanistan and methods of fighting were so different, as were the results. Red Dawn has some weak acting and it's campy, but it is a Cold War classic; good case study of mainstream American-heartland-style patriotism that's rarely shown in the cinema. Definitely worth showing to your kids.</fullReview>

Citizens against nukes (a/k/a Liberals) are hand in glove with those who wish to conquer the USA!!!Basically, this movie tried to show why Reagan and his CIA spook buddy Bush were justified for spending us into trillion dollar deficits, why tens of thousands of families in Central &amp; South America were considered expendible in the 1980s because the "threat of commie infiltration was so strong" (yeah, right), and why gun control was a terrible idea (answer: because commies from Cuba might invade the US, find your name on a form in a sporting goods store then come &amp; get'cha!!!).If your idea of fun is listening to Rush Limbaugh and having wet dreams about Charlton Heston and his NRA buddies, then this is the movie for you....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best cheesy teen/war movie of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Altered reality was never more cool in this film about kids fighting off the perils of a Russian invasion. While one just focuses on the campy nature of the film, the dark undertone to the film was quite startling. Breed your kids to hate an enemy they have no idea why they should hate in the first place. With some of the good young stars of the time, this film was one of those 80s teen films I can actually stand to watch on a regular basis. While this is not better than Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, at least it didn't follow some clichéd formula and dared to be different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful scenery and a fun (albeit not realistic) movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Definitely in the top 10. I know other comments on this site say that it is not realistic. And I agree that largely it is not that realistic to expect high school kids with little training to last half a year fighting the Russians and Cubans. But this is the kind of movie where you just have to take it for its value.I first saw this movie in Michigan in 1984. I think I like the fact that the pace of the movie is good from start to finish. There is some character development (such as C. Thomas Howell's character growing more jaded as the movie progresses) and Patrick Swayze's struggling with his emotions and the leadership burden. The scenery is beautiful. It was filmed in and around Las Vegas, New Mexico (where the mountains meet the plains), although the movie is "set" in Colorado. I have visited Las Vegas several times and it is neat to see the Serf theater pictured in the movie. Many shots were filmed downtown and you can recognize many buildings when you walk around downtown. Some of the scenes with the mountains such as Hermit's Peak in the background are very breathtaking.I also like the beginning of the movie, with the statute of Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders and the inscription thereon, as well as the end of the movie when Lea Thompson's character narrates a little. Overall a great movie that should be viewed more for the entertainment and action value than for its political message or military accuracy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It DID happen in US history... TWICE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who sneer at RED DAWN as being a ridiculously impossible right wing fantasy, it needs to be pointed out that events quite similar to those depicted in RED DAWN did happen in United States history, at least twice.The first instance took place in Missouri during the Civil War; although they didn't form the unit, two teenage brothers did join a Confederate guerrilla unit, and then took over when the original leaders were killed or captured. Much like Jed and Matt Eckert do to the invading Soviets in this movie, these two teenage brothers led their guerrilla force (which included a number of other teenagers) in wreaking havoc on the Union Army, and became legendary among the local population. Unfortunately, Frank and Jesse James are remembered less for being teenage guerrilla leaders than for the fact that after their side lost the war, their guerrilla force became the most notorious bank-and-train-robbing outlaw gang of the post-Civil War era.The second instance took place more recently on a much larger scale, when 116,000 square miles of sovereign United States territory was attacked without warning, occupied, and its 17 million people subjugated by an invading totalitarian foreign army. While I'm not aware of any teenagers commanding guerrilla forces in this instance, there were many teenagers among the thousands from the local civilian population who took up arms, and joined guerrilla units which were formed around the nucleus of survivors from the regular US armed forces which had been decimated in the initial attack. These guerrillas wreaked havoc on the occupying invaders for 3 years and kept them tied up, preventing the enemy from further conquest of other US territory, and paving the way for an eventual counterinvasion and liberation by the main US forces.I was born in what had once been that invaded US territory, where these guerrillas are still remembered and revered as great heroes; a few of my relatives were among these guerrillas. John Wayne and Tyrone Power each made movies about this period of guerrilla warfare, where they played leaders from the regular US military survivors. Apart from a pitiful general deficiency in historical knowledge among the American public, the main reason today's American public doesn't remember this invasion of its territory is that on July 4, 1946, less than a year after the Japanese invaders were defeated, that territory and its 17 million people became the independent Republic of the Philippines.Some may see RED DAWN as a right-wing fantasy. I see it as, right along with BACK TO BATAAN and AMERICAN GUERRILLA IN THE PHILIPPINES, a depiction of my former homeland's and my family's history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I rented the DVD because I haven't seen this in a while. I remember loving this movie when I was a kid. I must have watched it 25 times. Watching it in 2001, however, puts a whole new perspective on it. When I was a kid, we were always worried about being attacked by other (unnamed) countries -- bomb drills in school and all. Today, we don't worry about that stuff. For that reason, while I was watching the movie today, it seemed ridiculous in plot. However, remembering the time that it was made and the way I used to love this movie, I'll still give it a 7 out of 10. If nothing else, it brought back memories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can remember watching this in the cinema when I was 13. I was so totally scared that some group of anti-democratic terrorists would come and invade the country. I think I had nightmares about it for weeks, especially after the scene when they attack the school and the children are being shot. I never understood why the parents ended up in the POW camp and the kids were able to waltz in and speak to them. I have to say this is a pretty good movie, it does come across as an anti-soviet, pro USA movie, but didn't any movie of the 80's do the same? Remember Spies Like Us? I think it is worth a look, I am sure it will be quite dated now, but for those of you who enjoy going back in time I would recommend it. Patrick Swayze and Tommy Howell never looked better, even seeing a young Jennifer Grey before her nose job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is a dramatic view of one of the possibilities of the cold war with the Russians invading the united states using the Cuban problem and the Mexican border policy. The idea that a group of young people could hold of the army is a relatively well proved one and the movie proves why this is possible they know the land better than the invaders and they also have enough anger at the cruel way they take people away from them with the advent of the hunt they become to feel less like people and more like Wolverines whom both hunt quietly and inteligently and most importantly in packs this allows them to surround the enemy and take them apart one by one. A well made movie with a great storyline one I'd definitely tell all my friends about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is definitely not the most realistic film ever maid, Rssians invade America, and the only people who can stop them are teenage outcasts, who call themselves the wolverines. However this movie was not planned to win Oscars, but present a rousing cold war film showing that no matter who you are, you can still help your country from evil Russian stereotypes.Heading the motley crew is a young Patrick Swayze as Jed Eckert, he is joined by 7 other teenagers including an early appearance by Charlie Sheen as Matt Eckert as they get into a variety of situations with the enemy, from ambushing them to raiding a camp where the teenagers dads are being held hostage, however the final assault on the Russian held town does seem a little rushed with few extras. This though boosts the films kill count to around 60 + and i'm sure will become a cult classic in years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Old-school Cold War propaganda piece which does a fine job of hitting the ground running, yet forgets to pause for breath long enough to let the characters breathe. As a result of that, and the rather choppy transitions between scenes, this film has the feel of an aborted TV miniseries sliced and spliced into a cinematic clip show. The crew probably should've gone the route of the then-popular invasion series V instead: it would've done the plotting and characterisation wonders!Nice concept; clumsy execution. Maybe the remake'll rectify the flaws of its father. A fractured mess of a movie that failed to engage me as fully as I thought it would.</fullReview>

As far as the plot and stuff goes, and the messages of the movie, it was great, it just needs to be remade, updated, and made more 'real'.Some people apparently seem to think this stuff in the movie couldn't happen, but I hear many prominent military folks say it could, and there really isn't anything wrong with being prepared. A great movie for gun enthusiasts. If you ever had doubts about gun control, you may want to see this. It does the 2nd amendment credit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK the plot is far fetched beyond words. The Soviets would have overrun Europe first whether or not France decided today was not a good day die. Why send sixty divisions on a train ride across Siberia in minus God knows what weather only for them to get flattened by the USAF as they tried to mount an Operation Overlord style assault in one of the most inhospitable parts of the entire planet? But let's look at Aliens. This is a film about a group of gung ho American marines who fly to a planet in deep space and pretty much fail to do battle with a bunch of predatory aliens with acid for blood. Only to be saved in no small part by a civilian star ship pilot with exactly zero hours of military training. Aliens is rightly acknowledged as a great film. But in 1984 Red Dawn was more relevant to its time than Aliens will be in 2184.The left jump all over this film because they say it is propaganda for the NRA or because it is not based in fact. The fact is that if you hate war for any reason then you won't like a film that might encourage people to actually go and fight one if it lands on their doorstep. Even in that context this film is not patriotic like the Longest Day, the Wolverines are practically wiped out by the end of the film.Today our enemies see the no war at all costs attitude as a weakness. Would the film have made sense if Swayze had walked up to the commander of the latest army who hates the West and asked him if he would like a chat over tea and a scone?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrealistic but Stirring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so this is not the most realistic war film ever (lots of ***SPOILERS***)... First, it is based on a scenario where, during the 80's, Ronald Reagan either does not become President of the US, and/or the Reagan doctrine is not applied. The Reagan doctrine was the policy of challenging Soviet expansionism by the funding of guerrillas whose aim it was to topple Soviet-backed states (the most notable application of this policy was in Nicaragua where the US sponsored the Contras) and sponsoring states that were challenged by Communist guerrillas. In any case, the West continues the 70's policy of detente and shrinks back from conflict with the Soviets and MacNamara's "Domino Theory" becomes reality in Central America with all those states (even Mexico) becoming Communist.If you accept that as a possibility, than you must accept premise #2 -- the Soviets and their allies are able to quickly invade and take over roughly a third of U.S. territory without tipping their hand and revealing their plans to U.S. forces prior to the invasion. Moreover, the U.S. nuclear deterrent is not unleashed as both sides know it would be the end of life on earth.Finally, the U.S. stands alone against the Communists -- Europe has turned pacifist. They are seemingly content to sit out and watch WWIII from the sidelines.So if you suspend disbelief and accept all of these premises, you can then proceed to evaluate the film on its relative merits. Here are some highlights:1. The film shows how ordinary citizens (high school) students become transformed into guerrilla fighters. During the transformation, each character suffers loss, shows bitterness, anger, resolve, weakness, exhilaration, and exhaustion. The group has to resolve external and internal conflicts.2. The film both alternately glorifies and disparages war. Victories for the Wolverines come easily and some come bloodlessly for their side. However, the Wolverines do suffer losses (although not as high as history would suggest is appropriate for guerrillas as some reviewers have correctly pointed out - for instance, the Vietcong and Majahadeen suffered appalling losses against their Superpower foes). There is a Lord of the Flies undercurrent as to the evil that lurks within people as some of the characters become hardened fighters.3. The plot is generally weak. There is no lead-in to movement in plot lines. For example, when the downed pilot is taken back to the front lines so that he can cross the lines and return to free America, there is no lead-in to this. It is not explored why he is going back (why did he stay with the Wolverines so long in the first place?) or what effect this may have on the group. When the Wolverines go into town (on a couple occasions) it is preceded by a short discussion of "We are out of food", "OK, let's go into town".4. The action is exciting. Yes, the military tactics aren't the most realistic -- for instance, how could a group of 8 or 9 guerrillas attack a heavily armed reeducation camp and free all the detainees? Why would the Soviet fighter planes try to take off? Where does the group get the RPGs and all the explosives from? And yet, it is thrilling to see the patriotic US kids take on the enemy. We all wish we would have their determination and resolve against such poor odds.5. Some dialogue of the communists is over-the-top. For instance, at one point, the communists talk as if they have never fought against guerrilla insurgents in the past in any of their previous conquests. This seems unlikely. This suggests Americans have a unique brand of patriotism (doubtful) and/or is a result of Americans having greater access to guns (certainly true). The film implies both are true.6. The acting is ok. To me it seems neither fantastic nor terrible either. There isn't a whole lot of character development. When I first saw the move in the 80's, it wasn't exactly clear to me which characters were which. Before all the young actors went on to various fame/fortune, they seemed somewhat of a relatively interchangeable bunch (Patrick Swayze, as Jed - the leader of the group - is one of the few to stand out). Seeing this film again in recent years (after not having watched it since the 80's), I know who all the actors are and it makes their characters stand out more.7. There are some very memorable scenes. For example - Americans in reeducation camps. American civilians shot by firing squad. The Wolverines on the run from the Helicopters. The execution of one of their own group members for being a traitor. The tank battle near the front lines. The scenes in the mountains in the snow all feel very cold. The desolation and isolation the group feels shines through.This film represents a snapshot in time of the 80's to some degree also. At that time, Reagan's saber-rattling (for example, when he called the Soviet Union an "Evil Empire") and standing up to the Soviets by reinforcing the Contras (and guerrillas elsewhere), and deploying intermediate range nuclear missiles in Europe, just to list a couple examples, had many foes. There were fears that nuclear armageddon was near (hence, why Reagan simultaneously pursued the SDI anti-missile defense system or "Star Wars" to help allay such fears). There were widespread pacifist protesters in Europe who did not support US policies. The Soviets did exploit US history by pointing out the poor treatment of Native Americans - they typically did this whenever the US criticized them on their human rights record.During the 80's, Americans were more worried about a Communist takeover since anytime since the 50's. The communists were on a march around the world -- they had imposed martial law in Poland to defeat the Solidarity trade union strike and had invaded Afghanistan. Mikhail Gorbachev had not yet come to power in Moscow. As silly and far-fetched as these fears may seem now, they were real at the time and did exist. The miniseries "Amerika" - shown on broadcast TV in 1987 represents the swan song of such fears implemented in film.Communism was and is an evil system. This film is criticized by some because it shows some of the devices that the Soviets actually used (reeducation camps, brutality toward and repression of civilians). Such criticism is surprising to see. The communists system was and is a totalitarian system based on force and fear. It is difficult today to see how anyone could defend it (if you disagree with this, please read up on the history of the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin, or the Chinese during the Cultural Revolution). Yes, capitalism has its flaws and the US government sometimes demonstrates hypocrisy in its policies worldwide, but we and other western democracies clearly have the best form of government on the planet today.Taken together the movie is not great, but very memorable and worth watching. Like some other reviewers, I though of this movie after September 11th if only because of the rise of American patriotism and the shock of the attack on American soil. If you can suspend your disbelief on a number of key points, this is a feel-good film where ordinary Americans rise up to defeat their foes against unseeming odds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Red Dawn deals with an invasion of America by the Soviets and their lackeys circa 1984. Looking at this film post 9/11 and with an eye on what's happening to us here in Europe every day as the thought police hammer us into thinking our native cultures are worth nothing and multiculturalism ( aka colonisation) is good for us, Red Dawn is more relevant than ever. The film has it's flaws. One minute Jennifer Gray is a scared teenager, the next she's emptying a GPMG from a sexy diagonal lying position. The ease with which six or seven woverines take out the bad guys doesn't wash. There's also some awful dialogue ('it keeps me warm'). On the other hand Swayze delivers a blistering performance as Jed and the cinematography is great. A film I can watch several times. The basic thrust of this film is don't take your comforts and freedom for granted. The Americans sure as hell don't. I envy people in the gun owning Amereican heartland between the coasts who don't put up with any of the left wing garbage that is a daily diet here in Europe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A view of post Jimmy Carter America.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film depicted for me a very conceivable situation if Jimmy Carter had won a second term as President. Under Carter, our strategic posture decayed sufficiently that a desperate Soviet Union would lash out in hopes of staving off collapse from a series of disastrous harvests. The USA was so diminished in stature that NATO countries refused to honor their commitments under the threat of annihilation from the Soviet Union. The ultimate goal was access to the vast grain supplies of Canada and America. Only the British were honorable enough to stand by their commitment and were near collapse under the Soviet onslaught.The Chinese apparently attempted to take advantage of the Soviet preoccupation and suffered the results of a nuclear exchange that greatly weakened the Soviet ability to sustain their invasion forces. All this turmoil allowed the United States to blunt the force of the surprise attack. There are parallels here to the Japanese attack on the US in the Pacific theater in World war 2.The invasion stalled after horrific fighting. Alaska, most of western Canada, and most of the central United States was occupied. A lull in the fighting resulted with both sides trying to buy time to regroup. The invading Soviet/Cuban/Nicaraguan forces in the central United States were cut off and running out of supplies. Note the use of expropriated civilian vehicles by the invaders. The American forces were able to resupply and begin a major offensive near the end of the film. The situation for the invaders was deteriorating and they became ever more frantic and vicious in their efforts to hold on to their gains.The choice of Calumet, Colorado for invasion was due to its strategic location in a pass of the Rocky Mountains. This location was ideal to help block any relief supplies from the still free west coastal region from reaching resistance forces in the central United States. The convoys being ambushed by the Wolverines were attempting to resupply occupation forces fighting to hold their western flank from US counterattacks. The desperate invaders were unable to spare sufficient resources to track down the Wolverines and attempted to use reprisal killings of American civilians to deter further resistance. Only upon the intervention of Colonel Strelnikov was a more aggressive policy implemented. The new policy was becoming more effective and caused the Wolverines to decide that he must be killed regardless of the cost. This triggered the assault that resulted in the death of the Eckert brothers.The success of the Wolverines was due to the nature of their mostly Cuban/Nicaraguan garrison troop opponents. These were conscripted soldiers from a tropical environment thrown into combat in a winter where temperatures could fall to -40 degrees Farenheit. They were fighting people from a totally different cultural background who were far more at home in the local conditions. The Soviet troops were, for the most part, on the front lines facing regular American troops leaving the second-line troops to hold the rear areas. Also, the invaders seemed to have virtually no air power beyond a few helicopters and ground-support jets.The end of the film portrayed a seemingly victorious America that reclaimed all its territory. In such an environment, I would imagine that US troops would soon be taking the fight to Cuba/Nicaragua to avenge their assault on our shores. An enraged America would not be in the mood for forgiveness. The fate of local collaborators would not be pleasant in such an environment.The left-wing opposition to the film was due to its accurate portrayal of what communist forces would eagerly do if within their power. The fellow-travelers in Hollywood would have been among the first to go if the communists ever gained control. I view this film as a reminder of the fate of countries that lose sight of the predatory nature of international relations and the need to remain strong enough to deter attack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie raises two major questions:1.: Is RD a satire about the absurd and hilarious ant-communist-propaganda, issued and backed by every us-government?2.: Or did the us-population really think that there was ever a real threat of being invaded or attacked by the Soviet Union?To me this whole movie is just an evidence of the influence the propaganda against the soviets has on most of the people of the us. It´s comparable to the german propaganda against the SU and the jews during WWII.Apart from being totally illogical, it shows some of the worst acting of those "young hollywood"-stars.How on earth could the soviets carry massive amounts of troops, firearms, food, tanks etc. to North America, without it being discovered early on through cia/nsa-spies within the SU or by satellite-observation?Did the su invent some sort of cloaking/invisibility-device? Where were Captain America and the Justice League when you needed them most?Where did this massive fear of communism come from. Probably the us-citizens where scared to see the red army free afghanistan from oppression through warlords tribal chiefs. Well, because they erected proper canalization-systems, built schools, started alphabetization and inflicted equal rights for women on the poor people of afghanistan? If these are war crimes, they are guilty! But only from the viewpoint of an capitalist state like the u.s.a. which supports all kinds of oppression (chile, columbia, south-africa, vietnam, south-korea, saudi-arabia, syria, jemen, yugoslavia, uzbekhestan...).But we all know that the soviets had to be stopped. They threatened the us-population with racial and social equality and the destruction of being slaves to consumtion.It was an evil scheme that in the former Eastern Block they tried to create a better society. How evil and disgusting of them.No wonder the free dictators and big companies had to destroy it.But the history shows that capitalism is the only hope for humanity. The amount of poeple dying of undernutrition and plagues is constantly sinking.The us-government is helping good democrats such as Hamid Karsai, Assad jr., Putin, Djindjic, Pervez Musharraf et al to save the world.Thanks to the brave battle against injustice the world´s has finally become a safer place.The us-troops never ever committed war-crimes in nicaragua, chile, vietnam, korea, philippines, columbia or afghanistan.But of course this is dumb and primitive commie-agitprop.The us-society is the most equal, peaceful and just community in history.If you like sf-movies, look for "Invasion of the Killer-Tomatoes" or "Rambo III".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charlton Heston Should Have Starred</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American propaganda usually chooses a subtle form: celebrating consumerism, sexual conquest and rags-to-riches stories -- in essence, bolstering the individualist myth that is the American Dream -- instead of focusing directly on political struggle.And then comes a film like Red Dawn, which makes Communist bloc propaganda films seem subtle by comparison.This movie is essentially a right-wing fantasy from the last years of the Cold War, when Reagan was still using the phrase "Evil Empire" to refer to the U.S.S.R. and Rocky was having it out with his steroid-pumped Soviet archnemesis.Card-carrying members of the National Rifle Association will love this movie: it's practically a 2-hour commercial for the "right to bear arms" without any restrictions or registration process -- and since one of the NRA's favorite arguments is that Americans need guns in case we are invaded by a foreign power (e.g., the Nicaraguans or Cubans), we need an armed citizenry to defend ourselves. Having the world's most potent military machine notwithstanding.But as far as Cold War movies go, I much prefer the TV miniseries "The Day After" which goes much further in implying the kind of devastation that would occur were the two superpowers to go to war. Red Dawn, unfortunately, is closer to another right wing fantasy miniseries "Amerika", where midwestern Americans, watered down by liberalism allow Soviet troops to occupy the U.S. under the guise of NATO peacekeeping troops.... as if! (Why is it that right wing fantasies always underestimate the patriotism of the American people?)The Russian strategy in Red Dawn is that led them to success was to sneak in paratroopers using commercial flights and use Nicaraguan and Cuban troops to invade from the south. Many others have commented on the ludicrous nature of this plot, but say this doesn't detract from the movie. I do not agree. It undermines the entire movie. As far as "What if" scenarios go, i find "Barbarella" more compelling and probable.This is a terrible "war" movie for many reasons, but largely because it does not even begin to hint at the conditions of war. The destruction is minimal, the atmosphere is clear and clean the whole time, the general populace seems to be semi-content with the fact that Soviet troops are running things. At one point a singular American fighter flies over and starts bombing things far off: it's hard to tell what's going on, but we are told "this is REAL war." That's as close as the entire movie comes to suggesting that there really is a war going on, and with the shaky plot line, the lack of visual reinforcements is a major flaw. I am willing to suspend my disbelief, but at least one piece in the puzzle has to be there.Most annoying are the A-team like action sequences in which the high school football team blows up Russian tank after tank, using grenades, missile launchers and machine guns like they had been using them since kindergarten. Instead of launching effective sabotage missions, or even trying to get the local community into an armed resistance, they prefer the romantic isolation of hiding in the hills and then running straight into a military installation and blowing up everything in sight. At one point 2 of our heroes single handedly destroy an entire camp: tanks, airplanes, bunkers -- by their Rambo-like bravado of running straight in and shooting at everything in sight. The highly-trained Russian military could demolish the US Army in days, but they couldn't stand up to these two high school football players! While not outgunning Soviet troops, our football heroes spend a lot of time crying. (If this is you want in a movie, I recommend "Heathers" instead.) This the director's token stab at "character development," and seems to be the only trick in his bag that doesn't involve missile launchers. The director is obviously trying to make a few points about gun ownership, patriotism, and so forth -- but unfortunately (for him) the whole movie operates at a third grade level.The flag-flying scene at the end alone should cause any rational person to wretch. Though I doubt few rational people (present company excepted) could sit through this movie.If this movie ain't propaganda, I don't know what is. Now that the "Evil Empire" is gone, it's also a rebel without a cause. And that makes it all the more obvious what else it lacks: character development, realism, plot, acting....</fullReview>

The mid 80's was a tough time for everyone...but especially teens. All the dramatic changes that occurred then in every aspect of life. Red Dawn made teens feel like they had some kind of power...the relationship the brothers shared and the unity of the friends fighting such an overwhelming foe...well I guess you just had to be there. Kids getting movies out of retro bins..could not even begin to comprehend the mindset of that time...American or not. We also need to remember that special effects of that time could not even begin to compare with modern special effects.

		<fullReview>Here is a stereotypical movie about U.S. radical feelings and fears in the 80's. Soviet soldiers (hated in the 80's) invade the U.S. caught off-guard (a fear in the 80's) Patrick Swayze gives a memorable performance as Jed. Charlie Sheen starts off his movie career here on a very good note as Jed's brother, Matt. And I must say, he was EXCELLENT for his first big role. There were many other great performances to speak of as well.The action was great. Went well with the awesome story that was given.Many do not like this film. I disagree, I love this movie. However, I can see where they come from when they say they hated this movie. The Americans were portrayed as good guys and almighty heroes and whatnot. The communist soldiers were portrayed as thuggish, mindless, stupid, pure evil, and with no motive to their invasion of the U.S. BUT this movie was not meant to be a "documentary" (as said in "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City" , where they say "..the documentary "Red Dawn"). It was meant to satisfy U.S. "anti-soviet" feelings during the 80's. It was also meant to portray an alternate reality in which what COULD POSSIBLY happen if the Soviets did in fact, invade the U.S.I recommend this to open-minded people who don't mind sitting through some long-gone radical feelings in order to enjoy a good movie.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Did This Movie Get So Much Hype?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it me or did anyone else think this movie was all hype? red Dawn came out when I in 1984, when I was 12 years old. Don't ask me why but I never got around to seeing this movie until I last night 1/23/2012. When I saw the opening scene, I thought cool this is going to be an awesome movie. Imagine your in high school, listing to your History teacher and all of a sudden numerous paratrooper come falling out of the sky. The shock of it would make anyone stand up and take notice; especially when they start opening up fire on you and killing numerous classmates. I guess if I saw this back when I was a teenager and tensions with The Soviet Union, were high I probably would have liked it more. The Soviet Union is no more, some of it is in numerous Countries, i.e. Russia, Kazakhstan, etc.. I just thought since I'm older the whole story was very unrealistic, think about it; USSR/CUBA invading USA, where is our military? You do not see any sign of USA troops, at all; a helicopter and that's it. A bunch of high school kids fighting against Soviets/Cuban's. No way, our military would be all over, the Country would be on lock down; and kids fighting a superpower like the Soviet Union very unreal. Yes, this movie had a lot of the big time young actors and some good veterans; but that doesn't mean it is an automatic blockbuster. Kris L. CocKayne</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do we have this movie completely wrong?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently stumbled across this movie on HDNet movies. I'd seen it years ago, thought it was interesting at the time (I was a teenager) so I thought I'd keep it there. At first it was amusing. I was laughing at the ridiculous overacting, unbelievable storyline, etc. Then it got to the scene where 3 Soviet army guys are "sightseeing". They see a marker that details the discovery of the park or something. One of them starts pretending to read it. He says things like "the imperialist American Army slaughtered the indigenous tribes of the Americas" or something to that effect. From that point on, I watched the movie with a different perspective. I'm no expert on this film or this director, but I think it's possible the director was showing us what happened to Native Americans, but he used us as the slaughtered. Notice how the bad guys refer to Americans. You could easily imagine the same references made about Native Americans in "Dances With Wolves". Everyone talks about this film as either a conservative roadmap or a liberal's worst nightmare. I think it's at least possible that the director was showing us a new slant on how the west was won. How would we feel if foreigners invaded and took everything from us? Some would say that's what happened to Native Americans.</fullReview>

Don't you think a fleet of Russian jets entering American airspace would be taken care of long before they were over land? This isn't the only thing Red Dawn begs you to swallow, however, and how they handle the nuisance of the high school gang is equally ridiculous. Nonetheless I consider this a classic of my childhood and would watch it another hundred times. But let's get real. "Nuclear Dawn" would be a far more likely scenario.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made war film though a little too much propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Milius does a great job of creating a "what if?" Soviet invasion scenario. His attention to detail in the Cuban and Soviet uniforms, weapons, and mock-up vehicles creates a sense of realism. What makes the film a good war movie is that it doesn't tell the story of World War Three. It just tells one story of a few American guerillas in a small part of the war in its early days. The events are isloated to one mountain town area and take place over just a few months time in what is implied to be a war several years long that engulfs the entire world. The characters and the audience learn only pieces of information about the events of the war from Radio Free America and other characters passing along word of mouth rumors. This allows the audience to build its own picture of what's happening in the world. Milius also takes his war films seriously and there are no Rambo like scenes of shirtless guys running through the woods firing blindly from the hip. Combat scenes are filmed with a sense of realism and detail. Ambushes and raids are quick, stealthy, planned out, and brutal. The only downside of this film is the director throws his obviously right wing politics in. During the first day of the invasion, the Cuban colonel directs his attached soviet intelligence officer to immediately go to the local sporting goods store and get the names and addresses of registered gun owners to be rounded up. Is the director suggesting gun owners shouldn't have to register their weapons? There are also the re-education camps that reek of Red paranoia. Politics aside, this is a good enjoyable story of partisans in the war that never was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid right-wing action propaganda flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having grown up in the 1980s, I can testify that this film speaks to a very specific concern from a very specific era, though its message still resonates. Is the plot unrealistic? The answer to this question depends on which part of it one means. To its credit, the movie opens by listing a series of counter-factual events to help get the viewer over the most unrealistic premise, namely that the Soviet Union would ever have tried to invade the United States in the face of the Mutually Assured Destruction our nuclear arsenals could have effected. We can thank Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher and a number of other believers in peace through strength that these events are counter-factual, and join with Milius in razzing the peace-at-any-price bleeding hearts who would sooner have made this scenario a lot more plausible with their endless calls for unilateral disarmament.Of course, even with the counter-factual events, it's a bit of a stretch to suggest the Soviets would actually invade America rather than subvert it from within or just fire off their nukes and let the chips fall where they might. The Soviet Union was, after all, the wretched real-life dystopia that deliberately starved millions of its own peasants to death in order to collectivize farming, and its hellish collectivist system in turn is the one that left record crop yields to rot in the fields unharvested on numerous occasions while its peasants continued to starve; somehow, I doubt a government known to be so utterly heartless and indifferent to the starvation and suffering of its serfs in more agriculturally successful years would have behaved any differently in the event of a crop failure.So why the invasion-and-counter-attack plot? Well, maybe Red Dawn could have been about a full-fledged nuclear war, but The Day After (1983) had pretty effectively covered that story already. Soviet subversion? The short film The Children's Story (1982) had that story covered too. Knowing this, and in view of what we'd seen of actual Communist invasions in other countries (such as Cambodia and Vietnam), a story about such an invasion happening here in middle America might not seem so far-fetched if presented with a few proper hand-waves to the aforementioned obvious objections.In contrast to this one weakness, the vast majority of the rest of the story holds up a lot better to scrutiny, while critics' objections to it do not. Would Soviet and Cuban Communists really have been so cruel as to shoot up a high school (with RPGs, no less) the way they do at the beginning and then mass-murder civilians practically at random in reprisals for the young Wolverines' attacks? Anyone who asks this question must either be entirely disingenuous or thoroughly ignorant and naive: of course they would! Try reading about the killing fields of Cambodia, of Mao's mass murders in China, Stalin's daily massacres that rivaled and surpassed Hitler's in their cruelty and enormity, of the Soviet gulags and the torture and terror ordinary civilians daily faced for making the tiniest mistake; even the Nazis were never so cruel and evil to so many populations of entire countries as the Communists, albeit not for lack of trying. Really, Red Dawn is actually rather kinder to the Communists than they deserve.Is it realistic having practically every one of the Wolverines be white and male? What kind of stupid question is that!? This is a war movie set in Colorado! Of course nearly everybody is white and male! Everybody's pulling his and her weight here, including the Hispanic guy (though I do wish the story could have made something of his fluency in Spanish; like maybe have him spy on the Cuban invaders for valuable intelligence) and race is thoroughly irrelevant.Is the characterization of a homegrown insurgency realistic? Well, ask a member of the Dutch Resistance: NPR did, and he said it was a very accurate depiction of the kind of desperation, mistrust, and infighting he experienced as a resistance fighter in his own time. Could a few of the actors have given a better performance? Maybe. The scene where one of the kids' fathers yells after them to "Avenge me!" is likely to pull an unintentional laugh from the audience and probably should have been cut from the final product; but on the whole, I'd say everyone turned in at least a competent performance and some were quite excellent.Is the propaganda a little heavy-handed? In places, sure. Has that ever stopped people from enjoying a movie? Screen Junkies's "honest trailer" for James Cameron's CGI-saturated propaganda crap-fest Avatar neatly and effectively summarizes that flick's message as "military=bad, trees=good." For Red Dawn, one could just as easily summarize the message as "Commies and gun control=bad, American patriotism and survivalism=good." Hey, if the gun control freaks and America-haters and grievance-mongering Commie parasites infesting Hollywood and Washington D.C. and nearly all of academia get to have their propaganda flicks, why shouldn't we patriotic right-wing gun-owning taxpayers get to have ours?Red Dawn is not exactly perfect, but in the final analysis, it's fun, it's watchable, and it's far superior to the mindless action flicks Hollywood cranks out these days. Also, Commies and gun control ARE bad and patriotism and survivalism ARE good. The only thing appalling about this film's message is that anyone felt the need to remind us of these truths at all, a testament to the damage the Soviet subversives did to America's culture during the Cold War. More appalling still is that Hollywood actually thought it could dip back into this movie's success for a remake in this day and age when the Cold War is over and any idea even remotely patriotic and right-wing has been permanently banished from Hollywood's treasonous far-left culture forever. This movie came out in the right place at the right time, but now that time is past.</fullReview>

While it still has some thrills and momentum going for it (and the acting is decent enough), you shouldn't expect to be as excited as viewers who watched it in its initial run.Having said that, the remake that was made in 2012 was even more unrealistic. But more on that movie on its own page. One of the few similarities that they sort of got right, was the casting. There's too much depending on luck and coincidence for my taste.

		<fullReview>Youngsters grow up quickly in "Conan the Barbarian" director John Milius' "Red Dawn," an exciting, bittersweet, jingoistic, Reagan-era military actioneer with a provocative but far-fetched premise. The Soviet Union with its Cuban and Nicaraguan allies invade the United States. The film opens with a preface designed to sum up in short-hand the tense global situation in the fewest words possible. "Soviet Union suffers worst wheat harvest in 55 years. Labor and food riots in Poland. Soviet troops invade. Cuban and Nicaragua reach troop strength goals of 500,000. El Salvador and Honduras fall. Greens Party gains control of West German Parliament. Demands withdrawal of nuclear weapons from European soil. Mexico plunged into revolution. NATO dissolves. United States stands alone." These words appear as blood red text against a black background. As improbable as the premise sounds, Milius and co-scenarist Kevin Reynolds of "Robin Hood" fame turn it into a propaganda-style shoot'em up. This contemporary yarn unfolds in quiet, peaceful, little hamlet of Calumet, Colorado, in September. Enemy paratroopers drift down in the first scene while a high school history teacher, Teasdale (Frank McRae of "License to Kill") is lecturing them to class about the tactics of the great Ghenghis Khan. He goes outside to find out what's happening and shot to death by a soldier. The students and an older brother Jed (Patrick Swayze of "Ghost") flee into the scenic mountainous terrain with the blessing of their parents who loads them up with provisions. Our heroes take in two girls and tensions rise among the group when the girls refuse to serve in secondary roles. Later, they participate in the combat. One of them trades on her good looks to lure enemy soldiers into either ambushes or plant explosives. Clearly, this war picture leaves nobody in doubt to the ending, but the finale isn't sugar-coated. One scene straight out of a World War II propaganda scene occurs when one of our dying heroines booby-traps her body to kill a Russian soldier. Another scene straight out of an old frontier western occurs when our heroes conceal themselves underground to stage an ambush. Important characters bite the dust, and even teenagers perish during the initial enemy attack. The cast is a veritable who's who of raw talent including Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen in his cinematic debut, Lea Thompson, C. Thomas Howell, and Jennifer Grey. Swayze and Grey would team up again later in "Dirty Dancing," but here they have to dance dirty with murderous Russian troops. William Smith is terrific as the villainous Russian officer Strelnikov. Veteran Polish character actor Vladek Sheybal of "From Russia with Love" plays a Soviet officer. Composer Basil Poledouris provides an energetic as well as atmospheric orchestral soundtrack. The early aerial scenes as the camera flies through the clouds to the strains of Poledouris' martial music is stirring stuff. This represented one of the rare opportunities for veteran heavy Roy Jenson to play a sympathetic character. Several other anti-Soviet films were released when "Red Dawn" came out. Clint Eastwood's "Firefox" preceded "Red Dawn" by two years, while "Rocky IV" appeared the following year. Director John Milius never lets the action bog down in sentiment. There is one grueling scene when Swayze's character insists that the youngster staunch their tears in the aftermath of their loved ones demise. Jed and Matt wind up dying together on a picnic table. Matt dies first in Jed's arms and Jed groans about being tired. In the wrap-up, the narrator indicates neither Jed nor Matt were heard of again. America won World War III. "Red Dawn" gets gritty at times and isn't as upbeat as the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A small group of American teens hides out and resists a Russian-Cuban attack on America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red Dawn is an anti-war movie that draws upon the Vietnam War to make its points. It places America in the position of being the invaded land. That produces ironies throughout the film and allows viewers to see that people who aggress on other lands become occupiers. The people they are fighting become insurgents.The movie is about a Russian-Cuban-Nicaraguan-Hispanic invasion of America. A small group of American teenagers calling themselves Wolverines engages in guerrilla tactics against the occupiers. The Wolverines are insurgents. This is the major irony, and the screenwriters make the most of it.We get to see how different Americans react to the occupation. Some collaborate. Some defy the Russians and are killed or penned up. The Russians use the local mayor to help them rule.Colonel Bella (played by Ron O'Neal) is the local Spanish-speaking commander. An important irony is that he was once an insurgent himself who used guerrilla tactics, but now, to protect his men's lives, he orders them to travel outside "secured areas" only in squad size. This mirrors American experience in Vietnam.The Russian in charge is Bratchenko. He tells Bella that the wolverine insurgents are "beasts," another irony in all those wars in which Americans are the occupiers and regard insurgents as terrorist beasts.Furthermore, Bratchenko's preferred tactic is like that of Americans, yet another irony. Occupiers are occupiers, regardless of nationality. He tells Bella "You must kill every one of them, eventually. It's the same as Afghanistan." That's yet another unanticipated irony with the Americans now having replaced Russia in Afghanistan. And he adds "They'll never stop," an apt comment for what the U.S. is experiencing now in Afghanistan.Bella answers "Look, I was always on the side of the insurgents. I have no experience in these matters, but it would seem necessary to win the support of the people. As our opponents used to say in Vietnam, 'win their hearts and minds'" Bratchenko replies "And they lost, Ernesto." In this movie, the Russians and Cubans eventually lose and the Americans regain their country. There is a lesson in that. It's neither a right-wing nor a left-wing message. It's a message that such wars are very costly and can't be won. Peace is better.Bratchenko reassures Bella that morale is crucial and tells him to keep the men in secure areas and that the men will forget about the Wolverines. At that instant, a Wolverine who has infiltrated sets off a huge explosion. The shoe is on the other foot as this incident ironically foreshadows explosions in Iraq and Afghanistan, 20 years before they occurred. It foreshadows Taliban infiltration into Afghan security forces trained by the U.S.The movie has a number of faults. It lacks character development and it tends to lose its way amid the many Wolverine action attacks. The ending is more like a western or a dirty dozen than a war movie. But character actors like Harry Dean Stanton, William Smith and Ben Johnson pick it up. Ron O'Neal is outstanding. The flow of the ironies in the story carries it along, overcoming editing and other loose ends. There really are, besides that, a handful of well-done and suspenseful scenes too, such as when several Russians take a jeep into the mountains to look at the scenery and happen upon the Wolverines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Red Dawn to many has become a cult classic, being reference in popular culture like Scrubs and South Park. It was a film made at the high of Ronald Regan's powers, where the Soviet Union was seen as pure evil and very right wing films were being made, such as Uncommon Valour, the Rambo sequels and Commando. It is a product of it's time, over the action, cheesy action.Red Dawn takes place in world where NATO has collapsed and Communism has spread in Latin America, including Mexico. The Soviets and Cubans launch a surprise invasion of the United States, with a impressive scene involving paratroopers. In one town in Colorado a group of teenagers run away to the forest. Two brothers Jed (Patrick Swayze) and Matt (Charlie Sheen) lead the group and uses survival skills to live and avoid the fighting. When their return to the town they find out that the Soviets are after them and their parents have been sent to re-education camps. The teens decide to fight back. They capture Soviet weapons and start a guerrilla campaign of raids and bombings. This makes the Communist forces very nervous and end up taking reprisals out on civilians. But the teens, known as the Wolverines, offer hope for American resistance.The action is fun and OTT. This is not a gritty war film. It is about how many commies can be killed. If you want to enjoy this film you have to put the right wing ideology aside. This is a film that is pro-gun rights/private gun ownership, and that anyone communism is evil. A good example of this is the Communism troops shoot teachers and students at a school, and that Soviet troops try to rape teenage girls. It also has a questionable morality about the willingness of people to turn not only into resistance fighters, but also cold-blooded killers.They are problems with the films. As mentions there is it's political ideology, but the main problem is the actor. Most of it is weak, which is a same because Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen did end up doing better films. There is also little character development and one-dimensional characterisation: Americans good, Soviets evil. The most interesting character in the film was Colonel Bella (Ron O'Neal), a Cuban officer and former resistances fighter who does not like the extreme Soviet tactics and wants to take a more conservative approach. The film does try to touch issues of war morality, but not very hard.The film takes itself too seriously. It could have been more tongue-in-cheek in nature, or if it really wanted to make a serious film, the make up of the Wolverines should have been more balanced, not just teenagers. There are also some logical issues, like where didn't more people get recruited into the Wolverines, or why wasn't the Re-Education camp more well guarded when the teens go to see their day.Overall, an okay film, which you only need to see once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but suffers from a lack of plausibility at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red Dawn has all the elements of a good solid patriotic film, from either side of the fight. The major flaws are all at the military political level of plot development and the fact that these are never really explained to any great satisfaction does sort of strain the premise a bit. Over all I like the movie, a throughly enjoyable testosterone filled film that does make you proud to be American and realise the freedom is something that can never to taken away from unless your willing to give it up. So what follows is just my picayune points that were made during the movie.1. 500,000 Cuban and Nicaraugan troops invade. 63 Russian divisions roughly 600,000 men and tanks. The Russians come across the Bering Strait, cut the pipeline and drive south to Cheyene while the Cuban and Nicaraugan troops come in as paratroops disguised as commercial airline flights. Really what road where 600,000 men/tanks coming down from Alaska except the one two lane and in places gravel road that's there. They would have been annihilated before that got 50 miles into the US. Movie makes no mention of spy satellite data which would have picked up all this troop movement and build up.2. Russian nukes 400 million Chinese and they do nothing? The Chinese would have screamed across the border with everything they had not to mention massive nuclear missile retaliation wiping out the USSR. Ditto the US Navy via submarines, which gets no mention in the film, would have nuked Cuba and Nicarauga not to mention Mexico, cutting the supply line to enemy troops, then the Army would have driven across the southern US to the sea and cut them off.3. Roughly 1.1 million troops are going to hold 250 million Americans hostage, do the math, it would never work.4. Jeb is told during the winter that maybe in the spring the US is going to drop special forces in to help him. What they need to wait for good weather, some special forces? 5. Way too little use of the radio they are given and Radio Free America. This would have been there lifeblood and sustaining courage.I'm sure there are other points as well. This could have been a fantastic film and maybe even a mini series but it need to have a military adviser and a stronger scenario for it to score higher in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge of the 80's: The Red Scare, brat pack style!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red Dawn (1984) was one of the first movies to be labeled by the M.P.A.A. with the honorary P.G.-13 tag (I highly doubt this movie would get one today). John Milius' film not only reflects his paranoid vision of a future America but it also is a result of 80's Reganism and heavy handed flag waving patriotism. Beside the obvious right-wing leanings of the film-maker I actually enjoyed this movie. It always has been and it'll always will be one of my personnel favorites.Red Dawn takes place in the near future. The globe has been swept with drastic changes and America's enemies are at the gates waiting to tear it down. World War III was launched without the aid of nuclear weapons, it's pretty much a conventional conflict. A downsized military has been unable to deal with the communist horde and parts of America are under siege. One such battleground takes place in a small mid-western town.Brothers Charlie Sheen and Patrick Swayze along with their friends (C. Thomas Howell among them) flee into the hills when Soviet special forces invade their school and lay waste to most of the faculty and students. The students flee into the hills (with the aid of C. Thomas Howell's father) and that's when the fun really begins.Many of your typical 80's stars have parts in this film (Jennifer Gray, Lea Thompson) as well as several old veterans (Ron O' Neal, William Smith, Ben Johnson, Harry Dean Stanton). I have seen stills of a scene where the boys wander into a Mc Donald's that's populated with Soviet Soldiers (Was this cut out because of that Mc Donald's massacre that occurred in the early 80's) some of that scene can be seen on the trailer that accompanies the D.V.D. As you can tell, Red Dawn is one of my favorite flicks.Highly recommended."Boys! Avenge me! Avenge</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have most with negative comments actually seen the movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Judging from your responses, there must be a different version of the movie out there. "Why would the Russians attack a small town in Colorado?" "The American would have seen them coming with all of the radar detection they have" etc... All of those questions were answered in the version I saw."Why would the Russians attack": In the very opening of the movie, it was stated that the Russians had two or three failed grain crops in a row. Due to some political issues, the US suspended grain sales as well. With such a food shortage, Russia either had to starve or go secure food. The US being the number one grain producer, the US was the target."Why would the Russians attack a small town in Colorado?" (And it was Colorado, not Montana btw) Some of the comments seem to suggest that Calumet was the only place invaded in the country. When Powers Boothe's character comes in, he explains what happened. The Russians air dropped into Calumet because it was a stratigic mountian pass. By seizing the pass, they can keep US troops from going over the Rockies at that point to link up on either side of the mountian range."The American would have seen them coming with all of the radar detection they have" Again, Powers Boothe's character told how this happened. SAC bases and other key installations were hit by sabatuers that infiltrated in from Mexico. NORAD, our missle fields, and major cities were hit by a suprise nuke strike. So command and control targets were removed rendering the US "blind" The airborne troops came in on chartered flights and cargo flights. You drop in troops, sieze an airport, then land you cargo planes carrying your armor and vehicles. Also as commented already, 19 hijackers managed to take control of four airliners just recently and do their deed before anyone could stop them."How did the Cuban/Nicaraguans get that far north without any resistance?" Again, in the movie they stated that key bases had been hit just before hand. Presumably Army/Marine bases were hit too leaving little in the way of Armed forces in the way. Also, just how many troops do you think were stationed in America in 1984? The heavy bulk of our forces were in Europe at the time."Then there's the military element. Words fail me as to how ill-concieved this is. The idea that there would be a conventional invasion with no nuclear retaliatory strike by America is so laughably poor that it amazes me that this movie ever got green-lit."Again, if you watched the movie, it was stated that the Russians hit the ICBM fields in a first strike and took most of them out. Also stated, and what is probably true, the US wouldn't use nukes on it's own soil.It'd be nice if people actually watched the movie before "reviewing" it.Of course the premise is dated now, but it wasn't in 1984. If you try to apply the world of today to 1984, of course it is going to sound totally illogical. Exactly how old are you guys who are attempting to do that? Were any of you old enough to really remember what it was like to live at that time? At the time that the movie was made, it wasn't totally implausable of a theme.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Milius directed this rousing speculative film accounting what might happen if foreign forces(led by the Soviets and Cubans) suddenly invaded the U.S. without warning because of escalating tensions. In a Colorado town, on a wintry morning, high school students witness just that, as their teachers are shot, and enemy soldiers take over, forcing a group of students(played by Patrick Swayze, Jennifer Grey, Charlie Sheen, Lea Thompson, C. Thomas Howell, among others) escape into the mountains, and figure out what to do next, eventually becoming guerrilla fighters who are hunted by the enemy, but prove quite resilient, even impressing a downed ally pilot played by Powers Boothe. Exciting crowd-pleaser is well-directed, entertaining and thought-provoking, with not all Americans acting honorably(some collaborate) but a deep patriotic spirit here is commendable, with some quite realistic touches and believable characterizations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Judging this movie in the current climate doesn't do this movie justice. It is an '80s action movie, just not as stereotypical as movies like 'Commando' and 'Missing in Action'. Think back to the Cold War, when the world seemed to be in a nuclear stalemate and the threat of total annihilation was in the back of everyone's mind. When the world information you received came from a newspaper or television. No cell phones. No internet. The most important thing to remember about this particular movie is that it is a work of fiction. As with most action movies of the '80s, the entertainment far outweighs any instructional value. Afterwards, don't expect to be able to fend off invading hordes with the rest of the football team, just enjoy the movie.The story tells of teens that were able to escape initial capture, of invading communist Russians and Cubans, by evading and eventually taking the fight to the enemy. Guerrilla tactics were being employed to harass and disrupt the enemies supply lines. It's a fable born out of the real fear that a great portion of society had during those years. On the surface of the story, it seems almost like the glorifying of war that permeates much of the genre. It isn't until you dig a little deeper towards the end of the movie that you realize the story isn't so pretty. The innocence of youth is lost, or rather ripped violently away from the teenagers. Being forced to fight back against the invaders, the 'Wolverines' (adopted name from their high school mascot) slowly transition from kids to hardened war veterans and all the emotional scars that come with that title. The seasonal changes illustrate it wasn't a quick transition. While it is far fetched to believe a group of high school kids could best a trained army in conventional warfare, they engaged the enemy on their own terms in very unconventional ways. They knew their environment better than their adversaries. They were underestimated by their enemies. Would a real life situation equate to equal 'success'? Highly unlikely...but this is a fictional movie. Overall, it is enjoyable as a stand alone action movie. I enjoy it for a variety of reasons, but I think it stands out in my head as story of perseverance and strength of will. Where the bulk of society was content to submit to the will of the invading enemy, they resisted. How many people would have the intestinal fortitude to stand and fight for their country in the most literal of ways? I've seen this movie multiple times throughout nearly 3 decades...it's a plot that could easily be adapted for modern times. I'm interested on how the remake will turn out...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reality of the matter is almost any film that could be considered "Conservative" would be classified as on level of "Triumph Of The Will" (The infamous Leni Riefenstahl/Nazi Propaganda film) by the Left. This film is really about what could happen if we were invaded by an enemy and about kids fighting back to defend freedom. The cast is incredible: (Particularly Patrick Swayze (Jed Eckert), Charlie Sheen (His brother Matt) and Lea Thompson (Erica) who also is the narrator of the film). My favorite scenes are where the brothers embrace before they die, and the ending with Erica at "Partisan Rock", with a plaque that reads: ..In the early days of World War III, guerrillas - mostly children - placed the names of their lost upon this rock. They fought here alone and gave up their lives, so that this nation shall not perish from the earth. The question is can it really happen? CBN is reporting that Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi is considered the most influential Islamic cleric in the world ? and he's planning on creating an Islamic Super-State, which will impose Sharia on any nation under Islamic control..... We're talking about a Lenin here -- a jihadi Lenin who controls the flow of the ideology but also gives the nod with regards to general strategic direction............... Al-Qaradawi seeks not only an Islamic Super-State in the Middle East. He's working for the day when Islam will conquer America and Europe ? through immigration and proselytizing. Essentially Islam instead of Communism. But enough of the politics: I love this film, the action, the love of country, and Lea Thompson (Big Lea fan). 10/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wolverines pack a punch even after crying on each others' shoulders from missin' their mamas. Despite the high melodrama and hairstyles, Red Dawn reflects the tension of the times. However, the treatment is less than memorable alongside similar classics like WarGames. I had completely forgotten about this film until it recently popped up on cable unexpectedly. Unlike WarGames which has a nice balance of humor alongside the rather overt message, Red Dawn tries very hard to make us believe the good 'ol US of A has become another Russian occupied Afghanistan. My guess is there were Washington fear mongers who thought the plot was plausible, if not at least discussed it. However, the Russians eventually lost their Vietnam and retreated from Afghanistan five years later followed by the collapse of the Soviet Union.Maybe that's why Red Dawn is mostly irrelevant today like most Cold War era films. The premise seemed far-fetched at the time, and in our post-Cold War era seems closer to science fiction than fact.</fullReview>

The first minute of the movie lists a whole bunch of unreasonable unrealistic oversimplification of the worst case political scenarios that could never be. To understand how stupid is to read a simple history book. Whereas this movie predicts the end of western civilization, in reality the Berlin Wall would fall in only 5 years time.As an action shoot them up movie, this starts off quickly. The Russian are landing within the first 5 minutes. They're off and running. They never look back. They use all the hokey tricks and it all works. It's got a great young cast, and it's got great flow to the story. It's a fun and easy movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Red Dawn may be a fantasy but unless you head is stuck in the sand the events leading up to the invasion of the USA could actually happen. It did at Pearl Harbor and the Aleutians in WWII. It also occurred 9/11/2001. So to discount the events portrayed in Red Dawn as some Hollywood Fantasy is one thought but Hollywood could also be portraying events that could take place and give us food for thought. Red Dawn is actually a strong movie with a well written script and a strong cast. Patrick Dempsey and Jennifer Grey later teamed together in the movie Dirty Dancing. Powers Boothe added a strong cast member and although an adult did not replace Jed as leader of the Wolverines. The Wolverines were the ones that were the thorn in the side of KGB and Russian soldiers. As Lea Thompson so vividly points out at the end of the movie she never saw the brothers again but came often to partisan rock where children put the names of their comrades who had died so this nation would not die in vain.</fullReview>

Does that make you a terrorist or a freedom fighter?

		<shortDescription>throwback to old war movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a throwback to old war movies with some political commentary thrown in. It would seem the rhetoric here is right wing Republican. However, their propaganda is extremely well done and entertaining, focusing on very interesting characters. The Southwestern U.S.A. is invaded by Soviets and their allies, some of whom are conquered foes. After some initial carnage (which some will remember spoofed in an episode of South Park), eight teenagers go out on their own in the wilderness. They are led by the jock, Patrick Swayze, although the rich kid tries to assume control. Swayze has two loyal followers in his brother (Charlie Sheen) and a young man whose father was murdered by the invaders, who becomes the most aggressive of the group. They are joined by a downed American pilot, (Powers Booth), who gives insight into the plot. The story is very touching, and you care about the characters, which makes you forget the heavyhanded political commentary. The execution scene is the most touching since THE 49TH PARALLEL. A lot of character exposes are very good among the minor characters. For instance, three of the invaders are touring the wilderness when they happen upon Swayze and his group. Their banter gives a very authentic impression. Some of the banter between the youngsters, too, looks very credible. One flaw is that the three major leaders of the invasion force look stereotypical in comparison to the clever character development of the others in the film. In fact, most of the adults seem one dimensional in relation to the younger characters. A minor flaw in a very entertaining and emotional movie that probably shouldn't be taken seriously on a political level, but perhaps so on the individual and emotional level.</fullReview>

It is basically about what happens when the USSR invades the United States, and a bunch of teenagers makes a heroic stand against them and their surrogates ( such as Cuban Col. Ernesto Bella ( who does realize what happened is wrong). Spoilers: What is frightening about it ( almost 30 years after it came out ( not to mention 9/11)), is the ending with Erica who is only one of two survivors at "Freedom Rock" pointing out about never seeing the brothers (Jed and Robert) again, and this awesome quote. " in the early years of World War III, guerrillas mostly children, placed the names of their lost upon this rock. They fought here alone and gave up their lives "so this nation would not perish from the Earth". With everything that has happened since Obama has been elected, the lessons of this film has been forgotten. Beyond the politics my favorite scenes are where they kill evil Russian General Badenov ( talk about a perfect name for the villain)., and where an injured Jed carries a dead Matt away. 10/10 stars for a film on my All- Time Top 10 list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Reaganesque, Machiavellian Fairytale!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red Dawn is a blending of right wing beliefs and paranoias, fused with a typical storyline of the action genre. The entire film feels like it's been adapted from some short story found in an NRA publication. All the right-wing American cliches can be found in this film. The Soviet Union's sphere of influence has reached the Central American countries, merging them into the Warsaw Pact. Thanks to the scrapping of the SDI (or "Star Wars" project) by US liberals, the Soviet bloc decides to launch a deft assault on the US, knowing that the Americans will not resort to their nuclear arsenal for fear of a mass nuclear response by the USSR. Aided by scores of Mexican illegals who form a fifth column inside America, The Soviets drop paratroopers from captured commercial airplanes into American towns, a tactic that they used in their invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. An army comprising of Russian, Mexican and Cuban troops advance into the US from Mexico. The American army seems to have all but completely vanish, probably due to further defence cuts by the liberals, and all that remains to fight the Soviets are the gun-baring citizens of America. But unfortunately due to the gun registration laws, the Soviets are able to gather 4473 forms from all the gun stores within their area of occupation. And so armed with all the names and addresses of these gun-owners, they are able to arrest these unfortunate patriots and detain them in political re-education camps.The film Red Dawn deals with a group of Colorado teenagers who escape the Soviet invasion of their home town and form a terrorist group in the surrounding hills. A few subtle touches of irony can be found in the storyline such as the teenagers naming themselves as "Wolverines", which was Stalin's favourite animal (an animal whose nature, he was quite fond of likening himself to!!). Other touches, like the references to Genghis Khan that are made by the schoolteacher in the beginning of the film, which are later reinforced by the mongolian style headwear that is worn by Charlie Sheen's character. And also the scene where a Russian soldier deliberately misinterprets the words on a plaque in a forest to his comrades, so that they think the plaque was a memorial dedicated to a successful victory by the US government over the oppressed Arapaho Indians. This scene hints at the extent of the lies that were constantly fed to the average Russian by his government about the US.But with all the political references aside, this film is nothing more than an adolescents Rambo-styled war film. Thirtysomething Patrick Swayze gives an unconvincing performance as a teenage football captain turned terrorist, who successfully leads his peers into a series of attacks against the Soviet positions. On the plus side the film does have some realistic elements to it. The military hardware and uniforms of the Soviets are accurrate, and the film does show the invaders speaking in their own languages, which is nice change from the other war films that tend to have all sides speaking English. On the negative side the fight scenes between the Wolverines and the Soviets at times border on the ridiculous. The so-called battle hardened Soviet troops spend most of the time running into bullets, as well as enthusiastically falling into Wolverine booby traps. The Wolverines with their small numbers (about 8 teenagers!), scarce resources and lack of mobility (they mostly travel on foot!!), are able to destroy whole Soviet armoured columns and bases. Even the world's toughest anti terrorist group - the Spetsnaz are no match for the Wolverines, whose only military experience previous to this invasion would have been watching episodes of the A-team on TV. The Wolverines manage to wipe out an entire Spetsnaz platoon without any difficulty. Other absurdities include the Wolverines strolling in and out of the Soviet occupied town with relative ease. They even manage to visit many of their parents who are detained in a supposedly-secret political re-education camp. The laughable scene where Patrick Swayze's father, who is imprisoned in the camp, shouts to his son "Avenge me!!!" so loudly that they can hear him in Moscow. And yet none of the soldiers that are supposedly guarding this camp arrest Swayze and his followers on suspicion (despite the fact that Swayze's character is on the KGB wanted list!!).Absurdities are abound in this film. From Swayze and co leaving their Wolverine slogans for the Russians at the scene of every attack (A kind of tactic that would only help the KGB to pinpoint the movements of the Wolverines!) to US radio transmissions that blatantly spurt out coded messages to American terrorist groups behind Soviet lines like "John has a long moustache" and the "Chair is against the wall" (In reality such coded messages would be hidden in poetry recitals and songs, but in this film the US radio announcer strives to make it clear that the message is intended for the American resistance effort). We are also told that NATO has been dissolved and that America has been abandoned by it's European allies (Oh except Britain which is still supporting America, which is also rather ironic given Britain's lack of support for the US in any war where the Americans appear to be losing in, such as Vietnam, Korea, etc!)This film glorifies war while at the same time portrays the horrors that are synonymous with it. The terrorist atacks on the Soviets are very violent, and their subsequent reprisals against the US citizens of the town are equally vicious. The acting is also a mixed bag. The best dialogue and characterisations are focused on the Soviets, whilst all the cheesy dialogue is found on the American side. The film suffers from a fairly incoherent storyline, Wolverines wage attack after attack on the invading Russians, until the Russians decide to call in air support against the terrorists to scatter them. The film has an ambiguous ending that's sugar coated with Spielberg-sentimentalities that really dumbs the film down even further. In conclusion this film is a really a no-brain actioneer that tries nearly every trick in the book to try to be deep, but results in being an expensive and unintentional "Brat Pack" comedy. If the protagonists in the story were scripted as fully grown adults rather than teenagers, then the film would seem a little more believable, and more worthy of the praise that seems to levelled at it by some of the reviewers on this site.And before anyone decides to see this film thinking that it is relevant to the tragic events of september 11th, well think again!. That was an isolated terrorist attack on the US trading community. This film deals (but not in any great detail!), with a mass invasion and occupation of the US by a foreign army. There is really no similarity or relevance between either of the two!.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undoubtedly The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blasphemous Lackluster Awful Killjoy EpicFAILThe acting was so bad that I couldn't finish the movie without throwing up. I couldn't stand watching Patrick Swaze and Charlie Sheen act so terribly. Not to mention every other young actor/actress in this movie. The 80's must have been a desperate time for movies and music. Both sucked back then (mostly) and this was no exception. I am sorry, but if you think that this was even a decent movie you may want to have yourself evaluated. I am just saying. The remake blows this out of the water with production value alone. The story maybe somewhat decent, but the terrible acting distracts you the entire time so there is no point in even attempting to get it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow. Some reviewers are too serious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First. I am a Liberal. I oppose war in general, especially pre-emptive ones. But to make this movie out as propaganda is ridiculous!The movie is set and was filmed in a small town in New Mexico USA. Las Vegas, NM to be exact, (northern NM). I grew up near there - in the mountains. The movie is a pretty good depiction of what it is like there (well - except for the communist invasion and all that). Most people there, myself included, would own guns. Many many trucks would have a bumper sticker like "they can have my guns when they pry them from my cold dead hands". Lots of kids would be trained to hunt and use weapons, from a young age. I was. Lots of people there, including myself, are or were members of the NRA.Why is that all made-up or Propaganda? It is how life is in small town and rural New Mexico, especially in the Rocky Mountains.... It isn't San Francisco or Manhattan...Also, one person complained about the number of black characters. Have you ever been to Northern New Mexico? In my entire K through 12 school experience we had 2 black people. Thats it. Our high school had about 900 people in it, and K-12 probably around 3000 total... 2 black kids in the whole 12 years I was there. If anything, the movie did not have enough Spanish people (Americans, they did have the Cubans). This movie is great. It has everything you need from an action movie. It has Heroes you can get behind - but that still have realistic problems and struggles. It has bad guys who are evil - but that you can also see their side.It has fun battle scenes, and the characters share good chemistry and dialog - for an action movie. It is also fun to see Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey shooting RPGs instead of dancing.It is a fun "what if" and nothing more. People are reading way too much into this movie to make it into some political weapon.I enjoyed this movie then, and I own it now, and I am a Liberal living in one of the most Liberal cities in the USA (on the Left Coast ! ). Some people just need to relax a little and stop over analyzing. Grab a popcorn and enjoy the flick!WOLVERINES!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Russia launches a surprise invasion on the United States and before long the whole country is in their tyrinnical grip. With the country under a permanent state of siege, it falls on a group of high-school students to fight back and save the day.The film opens with no build-up or character development, and we are just thrust head-first into Red Dawn's utterly banal, ridiculous plot in which high-schoolers are left to take on the Russian military, without seemingly any help from the Air Force, National Guard or police (and where did they get so learned in the art of kicking Russian ass, anyway?) On the cornier side of the coin, we have to contend with Patrick Swayze (with full on Jim Davidson facial glare) and Charlie Sheen as brothers with a huge age gap between them, as well as forced crying scenes from Swayze (see why he never worked much in the 90s?) Speaking of which, director John Milius never prospered very far either, only going on to make iffy looking TV films as opposed to working in Hollywood again.And then there's the film's ridiculous length. It's about twenty minutes (if not thirty minutes!) too long, making it even more boring than it already is. Even on a cheesy level, the film is simply no fun at all. Avoid. *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its hard to write the 10 line minimum but here it goes... Acting... like amateur dramatics in Blackpool. I know cos I've seen it (sorry Blackpool). Script... did someone get paid to write this? What I find disturbing is that there are groups of "professionals" in the film industry making big bucks when all they can produce is this drivel and pass it off as a good film. What is worse I've read some very positive reviews about this film. My only hope that these reviews were written by children or maybe their pets.If this film was part of the human body it would be found residing somewhere between the sphincter and the appendix. On a farm it would be the really nice area near the field gate where the cows collect and deposit their loads.I'd be so embarrassed as a US citizen knowing that this garbage is being peddled round the world as an example of my culture. Luckily I'm not.I recommend everyone to see this film just for the cringe factor.But be warned and be very frightened...there are people out there who relate to this film and who control very some very nasty weapons.Perhaps the sequel to this film might be "Islamic Dawn" I'm sure that will go down really well in some quarters of the US....Some spotty teenagers fighting for the good old US of A against the evil dark force.Utter cod's wallop, demeaning and low brow tripe.By the way, did I mention that I didn't really enjoy this film much!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Red Dawn, clearly taking place in 1984, America is invaded by Cubans (allied with Russians). Nuclear weapons are never seen. Neither is acting.The filming/directing is horrendous. In long shots, nothing happens; you just see landscapes or people standing around. There are overlong, boring conversations fit only to be fast-forwarded past. You'd think the movie was worth watching for the actors, but they are so young and inexperienced that they become barely recognizable innocent bystanders in a clueless, unsympathetic story about stupid Americans fighting even stupider foreigners.There were many really good movies made in the '80s, and just as many really bad ones.

Whatever the case, you should not allow anyone to violate you and oppress you.Don't get caught up in the era in which this movie was made. The use of Russians and Cubans as invaders represented the reality, or politics of the mid-1980s. You could replace them with any group that seeks to take over our lives, not necessarily from an outside invading force, but also from within.There is an old saying which originated during World War II concerning the Nazi takeover of most of Europe......"First they (the Nazis) came for the Communists, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Communist. Then they came for the Jews, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew. Then they came for the Catholics, and I didn't speak up, because I was a Protestant. Then they came for me, and by that time there was no one left to speak up for me." This movie represents the importance of being able to protect yourself, stand up for yourself and fight for what you believe in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this only once, and couldn't finish it. The script was so bad, it would have been a laugh riot, if it weren't so disgustingly paranoid to the point of nausea. When America invaded Iraq, American television stations owned by Australian media king Rupert Murdoch, such as the Fox network, began broadcasting this film and announcing it as a "classic". Apparently not only political history but film history are to be completely re-written by the Far Right - effectively adopting old Soviet tactics that the Right once vilified as the denial of freedom of thought. In fact, George W. Bush himself would have made a wonderful Stalinist if he had been born in Soviet Russia - but hey, why let ethnicity get in the way, he IS a great Stalinist, he just doesn't speak Russian (or very good American for that matter).Milius started out his film career rather well, doing pick-up work for the likes of Sam Peckinpah, before directing excellent historical action films, e.g., "Dillinger" and "The Wind and the Lion". Then he got hired for the weird (and undeniably racist) "Conan the Barbarian", and everything about him just turned sick. Drugs?, Money? True colors showing forth? Only his psychiatrist knows for sure.I"m going to include here a part of my review of a recent video game inspired by "Red Dawn", "Freedom Fighters", because it was playing this game that made me think of this movie:"The Soviets could never have invaded America, nor would they unless the US tried to invade them first. The Soviets were too isolationist, and their leaders didn't trust each other enough to launch such an invasion, which would have strained their always unstable inner political structure (and their economy). If they had invaded, American reaction would have been swift and devastatingly violent, whether the US were led by Democrats - like Jimmy Carter, who, long before he entered politics, effectively designed the US nuclear submarine program, targeted specifically at the Soviet Union - or Republicans like Reagan. Despite right-wing rhetoric, wars are not about flags (what the Amish call "painted rags") or (cities). In 1812, Napoleon thought he had captured Russia because he had captured Moscow; the Russians let him know different. 42 years later, the Confederate Army fought Union General Sherman to preserve Atlanta Georgia, because they thought he wanted to use the railway network that joined at Atlanta as a base; so he had the whole city burned down just to prove he didn't care about their dam' railroad. The kids who think stories (about a Soviet invasion of America) make sense, haven't any notion what freedom really means, and so would never know how to fight for it. You don't start by willing to kill - but by willing to die. To die, because "freedom" is only a codeword for "the next generation" - that is, our children and our children's children, and the kind of life we wish for them to enjoy. If this "kind of life" is all about money and consumer goods, then it amounts to nothing. It is the ability to think for one's self and to define the self that thinks. It is the choice of morals, which admittedly deny us much of the grosser enjoyments in life, not a choice of objects to enjoy."The most serious problem with the American Right and its paranoid propaganda is that it doesn't offer any of its followers anything worth dying for, any value worth preserving across generations.Bushies have been tossing the word "freedom" about as though speaking the word were an inevitable result of breathing; but they have yet to explain what freedoms they believe Bush to be defending - since he repeatedly violates the Bill of Rights, the Constitutional foundation of American freedom - and since Bush has made it quite clear he never intended the Iraqis to decide their own government for themselves. So - "freedom"? - to do what? to what end?"Red Dawn" suffers the same miserable absence of values. Since the film's Soviets don't seem to be invading for any discernible political reason, the teenagers fighting them don't seem to have any political reason for doing this either.But that is a fundamental intent of all Right-wing propaganda: to scare people into killing others without giving them time to wonder why.And, unfortunately, there are plenty of people who prefer not to think for themselves.So if you want to "get stupid" for a couple hours, go ahead and watch this film. otherwise, read a good book - like "Red Badge of Courage" or "Leaves of Grass"; or just spend some time with the United States Constitution, and consider the hope embedded within it - the hope that the likes of Milius, Bush, and Murdoch repeatedly betray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I took at first to be a self righteous Pro-America Anti-Soviet 80s action film actually turned out to be something else entirely. Though the film is dated and has sub-par acting, the movie plays off the story more than anything else. The story us unique and does not make America out to be the bad ass super country. On top of that it plays both side and makes both, to a certain level out to be human. One of the most interesting parts of the movie is its dialogue on insurgency which is very important today considering Iraq. I think his movie is important for viewers today to watch so as to understand current events though it is not of the same quality it is interesting as the Battle of Algiers in its perspective on insurgency and terrorism. I ask viewers to look at the movie from this sort of perspective when they watch instead of judging it before hand and ignore Swayze and Sheen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me tell you that in my &lt;humble&gt; opinion, you can make patriotic movies with talent, and avoiding stupid propaganda. This one didn't.The subject is already fascinating, although we have to put it in context (cold war, 1984). North America is invaded by communists (Cubans and Russians), and a group of teenagers (football players in highschool) takes upon them to start the resistance."V", the Sci Fi miniseries did so much better on the subject, and without primal anti-communism (though the aliens uniforms were red eh ?)It goes from russians/Cubans landing in a desertic small town, attacking the highschool and shooting everyone in sight (negating both 40 years of technical progress with radar/air support AND rules of War) to a group of teenagers taking out soldiers (but we all know how a trained football player is sooo much better with a riffle than a Commie with an automatic AK-47) and the most stupid propaganda (eg. the scene where the camera goes from a sign that says "you will only take my gun from my dead fingers" and pans to a dead body, a russian soldier taking the gun from its hand).I mean, I know the fear of communists was bad up to the 80's, but that is really terrible. The acting is barely ok (thanks to some future stars, Patrick Swaize, Charlie Sheen, C.T Howell, etc. interesting to see their debuts), the dialogue is awfull and most of the directing ridiculous (hard to say if it's intentional or not, the director is after all John Milius -Conan the Barbarian-).This movie has obviously been made to make cash by playing on the fears of the time, the problem being that it is devoid of any intelligence in the plot and of any artistic quality...My rating : 2 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst propaganda movie since Triumph of the Will</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possibly one of the worst films I have ever seen. It may well have been effective Cold War propaganda but it fails utterly as entertainment. The premise for the film is pretty flawed - ok so the soviets might possibly have invaded (v. unlikely - even with a surprise attack the US could have easily out-nuked 'em) but would they really get the Nicaraguans to help out? I'm sorry but I don't think a bunch of peasants carrying pitchforks would have been terribly formidable. Still, what the hell, it helps justify funding those Contras eh?This would be forgivable if the film was actually watchable, but it is not. At the start of the film we get about 10 seconds to find out the principle characters' names, then it's straight into the action. This sets the standard for the whole film - little or no attempt is made at characterisation, and all those portrayed are one dimensional caricatures, who do little more than scream at each other and cry occasionally, hence the viewer has no sympathy for any of them. Any vestige of plot is sacrificed for action. Not that the action was done very well.By the end of the film I couldn't have cared less about any of them - except for Harry Dean Stanton who I felt very sorry for, he was obviously desperate for the money. According to a psychologist, 1 in 5 Americans are insane - judging by the positive reviews this film has received, I'd say it's more like 4 in 5. Watch Top Gun instead, it's miles better.</fullReview>

The Russians parachute down (from stolen commercial aircrafts you understand) and begin to suddenly use their RPG's on a school! Quite how and why they are managing to invade the U$A is obviously not explained, presumably because the "evil communists want to take over the world". A ridicilous scenario involving "guerilla warfare" conducted by a few assorted high school morons lead by the ever squinting Swayze ensues, to much crying and unintended hilarity. Nasty pro-Gun and xenophobic moments are thrown in for good measure. Looking at it's BO, it was a medium size hit, which says it all about Hollywood. Anyone who thinks that the scenario played out in this farce is even remotely plausable now OR then is either an idiot or suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.

		<shortDescription>Classic war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recap: A fateful morning Soviet paratroops, along with Cuban and Nicaraguan allies, invade USA. NATO has fallen apart and USA stands alone. A few high school kids flee to the mountains when the invasion hits, and upon seeing the maltreatment their families and friends in their town get, they decide to fight back. It starts almost accidentally, with a few soldiers that just happen upon them. But as they equip themselves with their victims weapons they get more and more ambitious. They attack both whole platoons and the Soviet base. But as they get more and more troublesome for the invading army, the pressure on them rises. The Soviets send more and more troops after them and the group suffers both from lack of food and shelter.Comments: A violent classic with some (to be) prominent stars in leading roles. Patrick Swayze plays Jed the leader, and Charlie Sheen is making his screen debut as Jed's brother. The cast also includes, among others, Lea Thompson, Harry Dean Stanton and Lane Smith.In all it is a pretty good action and war movie. It does manage to keep its balance, that the action scenes seem pretty accurate and thought through. It is only a few times they go over the top and turn to over-violence, I'm especially thinking of the beginning, the invasion, and I had my doubts then. But then they settled down to a better and more plausible level. To their credit is that they don't overdo the explosions, and doesn't rely on special effects to thrill. It is the story that drives this movie, only augmented and emphasized by the violence, not the other way around.It shows sometimes that is made in 1984, more than 25 years ago, but since the movie does rely more on hardware and story than special effects that doesn't disturb very much. It also helps that much of the story is set in the national park, in the wilderness, and it doesn't show much of buildings, vehicles or clothing (the kids use military gear mostly) that could give away its age.I can understand why it is considered to be a classic. It is well done and very entertaining, definitely recommended. Apparently there are remake coming, it should be interesting to see how they handled it but I doubt it will be better than the original.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One day, in the town of Calumet, Colorado, high school students are setting through a boring history lecture when a group of Russian and Cuban paratroopers show up in the back of the school, firing machine guns into the classroom and RPGs at school buses! Fast-forward a bit, and a handful of teens from the school (Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, Jennifer Grey, Leah Thompson, C. Thomas Howell, Brad Savage, Darren Dalton, Doug Toby) have fled to the mountains, with rifles, bows-and-arrows, and some soup. After witnessing the imprisonment of Swayze and Sheen's father (Harry Dean Stanton) and hearing about the murder of Howell's (Roy Jenson), they form the guerrilla group, the Wolverines, who go from a few kids in the woods with rifles to a fearsome terror that strikes fear into the hearts of their occupiers. The inept Communists (led by Vladek Sheybal and a sympathetic Ron O'Neal) are unable to handle the situation, until the fearsome Colonel Strelnikov (William Smith) - not the guy from "Doctor Zhivago" - shows up with actually effective tactics which decimate the Wolverines. The Wolverines are ultimately forced to make a desperate last stand to save America and kick some Commie butt! Ignoring the heavy-handed political aspect of the film - not to mention the plausibility - one should take into consideration that ALL of John Milius' films, especially this one, are at heart escapist fantasy films. This movie involves the ultimate childhood fantasy - forming a guerrilla band with your friends to fight off invading enemy forces. What red-blooded ten-year-old American boy doesn't dream of doing that? I know I did, and spent hours re-enacting the film in the backyard with my brothers. Anyone criticizing the film should view it on that level, and that's why my review includes so many exclamation points and informal writing.Is the film realistic? No, not really - as others have pointed out, it's basically an alternate history where enough things go wrong (Soviet invasion of Poland, collapse of NATO, Communist take-over of Latin America) to make the invasion possible. The story of teenagers going into the woods and forming a guerrilla group, however, is not THAT implausible; Milius had the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in mind, but throughout history there are innumerable instances of such groups being formed. The movie's pro-2nd Amendment posturing is a bit ham-fisted, but it's nonetheless a very pertinent argument - the main reason the US will probably never be invaded by conventional forces is because they'll be facing down the barrels of 200,000,000 privately owned guns, even if they defeat our armed forces.However, Milius' film does contain a lot of realistic detail, in the uniforms/hardware of the Communists. And how refreshing is it to hear Russian/Cuban soldiers actually speaking Russian and Spanish? And how cool is the casting of bad-ass character actor and ex-Marlboro Man William Smith as Strelnikov - a guy who is also a fluent Russian speaker and actually taught it at UCLA for several years? The great Vladek Sheybal plays a nasty villain for the umpteenth time in his career, but what the hell, he's good at it. And Ron O'Neal's Colonel Bella is actually a sympathetic character - as an ex-partisan himself, he can sympathize with the guerrillas, and is repulsed by the heavy-handed tactics of his colleagues.The teen acting is not god-awful. If one can get past the laughable opening (I still don't know why the spearhead of the Russian forces would attack a high school, but what do I know?), you see surprisingly well-drawn characters. Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen are the best as the Eckert Brothers, holding up their end well. Their relationship is believable, and Swayze in particular is good as the quarterback who is thrust into a life-or-death situation. The rest of the cast - a veritable Who's-Who of '80s stars (is this enough to say it's a Brat Pack film?) - is not as good, though to be fair they have less to do. It is kind of amusing to C. Thomas Howell as a border-line psychopath though. It doesn't hurt that their parents are played by great character actors like Ben Johnson ("The Wild Bunch"), Roy Jenson ("The Wind and the Lion"), Lane Smith ("V"), and Harry Dean Stanton ("Cool Hand Luke") either. And there's the great Powers Boothe as Tanner, the hotshot fighter pilot who briefly joins up with the gang.The film's action scenes are pretty good throughout. They aren't the most impressive you'll ever see, but they're believably done. Highlights include the initial skirmish with a Russian patrol (killed after deliberately misreading a National Park Service plaque) and the liberation of the Russian re-education camp."Red Dawn" is, in short, a very cheesy, silly, dated film (we haven't even mentioned the cheesy '80s syntho-score), but one that is good for some mindless fun and a few laughs if you're in the right mood. Release your inner child, forget your political leanings and enjoy one of the silliest movies ever made. WOLVERINES! 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating premise, but a lot of flaws. And yes, it is propaganda.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has sufficient problems that, to save space, I am forced to categorize and list them. Premise Flaws: 1. The dissolution of NATO,communist takeover of Central America, and Revolution in Mexico are all wildly improbable... yet in the spirit of alternate history and 'what if?', acceptable. What I don't accept is the element of 'surprise'; these events would necessitate a high level of alertness and mobilization in the American military, law enforcement, and populace. There would be no 'charter planes' brimming with Spetznaz commandos and Cuban soldiery, nor 'insurgents' infiltrating through the Mexican border. 2. Any use of nuclear weapons by the Soviets would have elicited a nuclear response amounting to total annihilation. Hence a fun Cold War acronym: MAD- Mutually Assured Destruction. Nukes are never tactical, even when they're intended to be, because their effects are strategic. 3. Powers Boothe's character mentions that the Soviets reinforced with '60 divisions; three full armies' or something like that. That's something between several hundred thousand and half a million men, depending on whatever Soviet TO&amp;E was at the time. Moving that many men and all their equipment from Russia to North America would take the world's largest merchant fleet (which Russia never had) several trips under ideal circumstances (with U.S naval capability, ideal would NOT be the word). It could not be done by airlift, under any circumstances, not even granting an improbable Soviet air superiority or the cost of maintaining that superiority. Even if, by some miracle, it happened, it would take the same miracle again to supply those soldiers. Impossible. 4. I do believe that foreign invasion of U.S soil would spark guerrilla action, probably stronger and more professional than portrayed in this movie. I also believe that the first generation of guerrillas would have a very high mortality rate. The learning curve for partisans is steep and unforgiving. The kids in this movie make too many mistakes too quickly, and trust too much. After they made the first leap, from escape and evade to active partisan, they would have been dead in days. Really, half a dozen teenagers just can't attack an armored column with Kalashnikovs and RPGs and expect to survive.Tactical flaws and mistakes: 1. Commandos would have difficulty holding mountain passes, considering that local military and law enforcement would react faster than reinforcement could come. I doubt that they would expend their energy sacking a mountain town, when they should be positioning themselves to take control of certain highways and railways at specific junctions or highly defensible locations. 2. If Soviets did want to take control of a town, instead of simply destroying it, they would not come in guns blazing. They would probably converge on local law enforcement, civil government, key utilities, and key escape routes. They're trying to PRESERVE the town, and its inhabitants, so that both can be of use to them. 3. The action in this film is very Hollywood, with lots of hip-shooting and pyrotechnics. What it really comes down to is this; kids can't fight. Maybe rural kids can shoot, maybe they could hit a deer at 400 yds with Daddy's .30-06, but they're facing professional soldiers steeped in a military doctrine that half the world's armies follow, and hardened by years of guerrilla war, revolution and counterrevolution. The outcome was never in doubt.Red Dawn is still an entertaining 'what if?' movie, full of moderate acting from the promising young stars of two decades ago. John Milius' directing is adequate for the level of movie he was making, and I think it's says something that a basically B-movie like Red Dawn can spark such heated discussion twenty years later in a radically different political climate. Whatever one thinks of his politics, it can't be denied that this movie made a splash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie for the first time a few days ago, and I was very impressed. Foreign invaders take over a small American town and begin setting up a base of command. A group of high school kids manages to escape to the woods, and after seeing the invaders kill their loved ones, they start using guerrilla tactics to fight back. They are able to pose a legitimate threat to the invaders, and well, you'll have to see the rest.I'm confused by how many people gave this a negative review. Most people say that this is a movie about Communism, the Cold War, what could happen in America, etc. They saw it's pro NRA, sexist, and has a political agenda.These people need to put these issues aside and see what lies underneath. This is a character-driven action movie about hardship, survival, friendship, vengeance, loyalty and ultimately, the evils of war.The details about how the enemy was able to invade are not seriously addressed, because these are not important details in the movie. In fact, there is rare mention of who the enemy really is and what they want. This is because the only important thing about the enemy is that they are foreign invaders. Communism, the Cold War, and the USA are all merely stages for this movie, they do not hide a political message or warning unless you take them in context with the time period of the film.As far as it being pro-NRA, this is a war movie, there's going to be guns, get over it. That the kids know how to hunt isn't pro-NRA, it's just necessary that they know how to use guns for the story. As far as violence, yes there are a lot of action scenes, but the action scenes are purposefully minimalist, you only see the details you need to see.As far as sexist, I feel the film is the exact opposite. In fact it seems to reek of equality. If gun-toting high school girls fighting alongside boys is sexist, then I don't know what sexism is. One reviewer says it's too macho. OK, maybe I could see that, except for the fact that every male character cries his brains out at least once during the movie, is this macho?This is not the most realistic movie plot-wise. I feel the movie asks you to suspend your disbelief from the opening of the movie. If you think that hundreds of paratroopers being dropped outside your high school class room and killing your teacher doesn't plunge the movie into a level of fiction approaching sci-fi then get your head checked. It's only important that the characters believe what's happening is real, and that is enough. Go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The comparisons between this and Rambo: First Blood Part II are staggering, not only in the ridiculous depiction of exaggerated violence, but also in the hidden political agenda of the filmmakers. Obviously this is a low-budget work, that is obvious early on. Red Dawn has one of the better "anti-war" morals that I've ever seen, but the VietNam analogy here devloves into a depressing fantasyland of machismo and bullets.Like many John Woo movies, Red Dawn solves whatever problems the script has with more action, maiming, and bloodshed. If you aren't getting a little tired of seeing the hundredth Russkie invader then something's wrong with you.Overall, the movie's message has dated severely. On the plus side, the sound effects and film editing are slightly better than Rambo's. 2 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>::Spoiler Alert::The Cubans and The Russians have landed in Middle America and all Hell is breaking loose. Jed and Matt Eckert (Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen) lead a rag tag bunch of High School students against the enemy forces. Naming themselves after their school mascot "The Wolverines" they kill enemy soldiers and take stock of the enemies weapons so they can fight back with force. Along the way two females (Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey) join The Wolverines and soon after they befriend a fallen Air Force Colonel (Powers Boothe) who also joins. By movies end only one male member and one female member are all that's left of The Wolverines. The quota at the end of the movie is almost prophetic but Thank God it never came to be for real.Nowadays, Red Dawn is a history lesson showing people what life was like for America during the Cold War Era of the early 1980s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It might be pure fantasy, but this dangerously paranoid cold war drama "Red Dawn" with its outlandish, but ambitious premise truly shows that with heartache can come glory. No matter what side you find yourself on. Its vision is a powerful, disturbing one and seen through the eyes of the children and it's their flag waving story that the magnifying glass follows. From them fleeing in fear, to discovering the whereabouts of loved ones and eventually taking one's life. They're emotionally tested in what is an inspiring coming of age through harrowing extremities and heroic exploits. A small ragtag of teens flee to the Colorado mountains after their town was invaded by Soviet Union soldiers. There at first they simply try to survive in the wilderness, but they learn its WW3 with loved ones being executed and so they go about guerrilla warfare under the name "Wolverines". With a young up and coming cast like this, you could tell this was aimed for a teenage audience. Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, C. Thomas Howell and Lea Thompson. They're quite good in their spiritedly raw deliveries (especially watching the cold-hearted transformation of Howell's character) and forming as one by taking the war back to the Russians, but they're balanced out by the seniors. Ben Johnson and Harry Dean Stanton have tiny parts. Powers Boothe simply commands the screen as an American jet pilot. Playing the Russians with plenty of vigour are Ron O'Neal and William Smith whose ruthless character is brought in to hunt down the "Wolverines". O'Neal's performance is a hearty one, as his character's mindset shares everyone's feeling by the end. Here the Russians actually speak Russian with the subtitles being used. Director / co-writer John Milius conventionally focused styling is packed with tactically precise action and lean dramatics favouring pulpy propaganda. The opening scenes of the invasion where the Russians parachute in to this small community is filled with memorable imagery. From then onwards we're thrown right in to the comic-book excitement and rarely does it let up on its upbeat tempo despite the overlong nature. The script's concentration is only on this small community behind enemy lines, despite America being under attack. Our information of this comes from Boothe's character. The mountainous terrain while picturesque is desolate and unforgiving. Sensationalized B-material given quality treatment."All the hate is going to burn you up kid".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like a lot of 80's films, you have to view it in the context of the times. The Cold War was an ever present worry, there were two SuperPowers back then in a fierce arms race after the end of WW II. At the end of that war we knew just how brutal the Soviets could be, after defeating Germany and Japan we should have confronted Stalin, but the Allies were spent and so the Cold War simmered instead. History has been re-written to make Reagan a hero for facing them down, but at the time it seemed like he was foolishly provoking them. If you weren't alive then you don't appreciate how high the tensions were. The Soviets were a real mass murdering brutal enemy, armed to the teeth, relentless and expanding. The so called Terrorist Enemy of today is practically cuddly. Reagan crippled them economically by leading luring them to play catch up in arms, but at the time it seemed like things were escalating to a fight.An invasion is fanciful, but the more realistic Atomic Annihilation would have been a much shorter film and wouldn't have had as much man in the street (high school) character drama. This movie puts Us into the situation in a What Would You Do? Collaborate or fight? It's not a great film, but it is a film that I enjoyed. It doesn't have a typical Hollywood ending, like the more recent Battle LA. It does however show some realistic skirmishes, some tough consequences of choosing to fight and just how clumsy and difficult that first taking of a life can be.You just can't judge it with a solely post 2001 political and social mind set.I am somewhat disgusted with the idea that the remake for 2011 has chosen the North Koreans as the bad guys. Hardly a SuperPower. Clearly we don't want to offend the real SuperPower of today, China. Though I can see why China invading would be laughable, they already own us.</fullReview>

The heroes would then defeat the raghead invaders and bring victory to the real Americans, who want nothing to do with having Islam nor having "sharia" imposed upon them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A politically correct film of its time...thus, it has dated badly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an action movie, RED DAWN certainly has its logistics in the right place. It also gives us a cast of future stars (Charlie Sheen, Lea Thompson, Jennifer Grey, Patrick Swayze) and veterans (Ben Johnson, Harry Dean Stanton, Powers Boothe, William Smith) all giving it their best in a story of a small Colorado town being overrun by Soviet and Cuban forces at the dawn of World War III.Not surprisingly, given when this was made, during the height of the Reagan years and enhanced tensions between the U.S. and the Soviets after the Korean Airlines shootdown, the film's politics worked to parallel real-life nack in 1984. The further non-surprise is that the film's director, John Milius, is practically the only one of the 1960s film school generation to harbor a seemingly insatiable taste for war, guns, and far right-wing politics.It's too bad that he had to resort to such tastes here, because those beliefs of his totally weigh down what appeared to be a very realistic scenario. In much the same way that John Wayne (another Hollywood right-wing politico) had allowed his politics to interfere with his cinematic sense in THE GREEN BERETS, Milius allowed his own right-wing brand of political correctness to seriously date RED DAWN today. His action sequences are inspired more by the mechanations of Sam Peckinpah than anything else, and they are well choreographed. But the flag-waving bluster of his dialogue is cinematically unnecessary, if not downright laughable now.Simply put, the politics of RED DAWN, much like the similar RAMBO and MISSING IN ACTION films of the same time, have badly dated it in the era of PLATOON, FULL METAL JACKET, and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. It was good back in '84, but it could never be a classic.</fullReview>

A completely implausible scenario, lacklustre acting and one of the worst scripts ever committed to screen make this film a chore to watch. The storyline is: The Russians and Cubans invade America. That's all we're gonna get! It follows a group of really obnoxious kids who become soldiers (they are led by the school quarterback, surprise surprise!) and fight off the invasion. Most of them die (not all of them, unfortunately). Anyway, it's got to be the most cheesy film I have ever seen. Here's some sample dialogue: "I love you dad." "I love you too son" "Tell mom I love her." "Don't you cry son, don't you ever cry again." etc, etc. These kids spend all their time either shooting or crying. The director attempts to add a Lord Of The Flies scenario, but fails miserably, as you just wish that the kids WOULD just kill each other. The thing that really ruined this film for me was the presence of Powers Boothe, one of my favourite actors. What he was doing in this crap I will never know. This terrible, terrible film is clearly reaganite propoganda designed to make Americans hate Russians. There are scenes of bloody massacres and murders of civillian, designed to make us hate the Russians even more. However, the film makers clearly "forgot" that what is portrayed in the film as sick and evil, is exactly the tactics used by American troops in Vietnam.

Far, far from it! When I saw the sinister parachutes on the poster with the western landscape: ah hah! -- a movie of VANDENBERG (197?) -- a novel about America under heel which I could not put down in 1973, but with a very un-American ending. Well, the world is full of fools, so I paid my admission.In fact, RED DAWN is like some production bankrolled by the National Rifle Association. I walked out in that tender moment when the man gave the boy a box of extra ammo, almost as a priest would elevate the Host. But then gun worship is a secular religion to this country's hard right. Something has to make them feel like men.RED DAWN is gringo paranoia where-by Americans project their bad traits on someone else. If you want two excellent treatments of a conquest of the United States, try: 1) INVASION U.S.A. from the early 1950s which haunted my early youth and harbours a surprise. It is not great film by any means, but is a thriller made at the height of the McCarthy paranoia when Hollywood was eager to show how patriotic they could be. 2)TWILIGHT ZONE episode "The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street." This mere half-hour shows how a "foreign" enemy could get over-wrought Americans to killing one another, fearful and violent . . . then without firing a shot, the invader mops up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is this movie so freaking incredibly underrated? Here's why: 1. The plot has an alliance of Soviets, Cubans and Nicaraguans (huh?) inexplicably invading a small town in the Rockies and getting out flanked by a bunch of high school kids who learn how to be guerilla fighters by running off into the woods and engaging in arcane blood rituals. 2. If that isn't brilliant enough, we have dialogue that sounds like it was written by Sylvester Stallone on crack, frequent lapses in continuity, narrative and common sense, location shooting that looks like a cheap Hollywood back lot and unctuous pro fascist ideological posturing. 3. Curiously enough this 'film' was apparently intended as a kind of back-up propaganda for the Reagan goon squad's terrorist war against Nicaragua. If it had been a little more subtle and intelligent it may have enjoyed a wider success. Unfortunately, self proclaimed 'Zen fascist' John Milius is a poor writer and even worse director, so the whole project comes off like one of Pat Buchanan's bad trips. 4. Not-so-curiously, this 'film' has become a cult hit among swastika fetishzing militia types and other right-wing back passage stalkers who undoubtedly require lots of astroglide during screenings of this risible attempt at neo-nazi agitprop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though I'm not American myself, I am used to the propaganda and flag-waving idiocy in the American media, having reviewed such horrible titles as "The Patriot". This was a bit different, but in the end, it's the same thing.The plot is rather hectic and sudden, but that's war I suppose. The film opens with normal classes going on at a high school in the Midwest America, and suddenly waves of troops, later shown to be Spetsnaz, flood over the quaint town and completely take it over, putting in into occupation. That's right, the number one fear of every American in the Cold War: complete Soviet takeover. Well, not exactly complete.A group of teens manage to escape into the woods and mountains surrounding their town, and become dead-set on taking their town back. This is where a plausible, guerrilla situation takes a turn for the stupidly worse. The rest of the film is of little importance. It basically shows the students, now in a group known as "The Wolverines", fighting and beating the you-know-what out of every pesky Russkie that comes there way. Eventually, the entire group is killed, but it is hinted the invasion was beaten back.In the Cold War, America's view of it was simply hopeless. Everyone expected either to be nuked into dust or swarmed over and taken control of by the Soviets, but this movie provided a different, albeit implausible, outlook. The film gave hope, showing that if the Soviets attacked, the Yanks could still win (why they needed morale-boosting propaganda in the late 1980s, when the Soviet Union was on the brink of collapse anyway, I haven't a clue).Here are the worst complaints I have though: 1. A group of teens couldn't defeat Soviet forces. Obviously the directors were hard-core patriots, but they need to come-to with reality: 4, 5, or 6 teens aren't nor could stand up to even a handful of Soviets, unless of course the Soviets just gave up and killed themselves.2. There is no real plot. It's just repeated scenes of attack and attack by the Wolverines.3. The Soviets are portrayed as their typical, bumbling selves.Though as a propaganda piece, I suppose it served its purpose, but as a movie, it failed fairly poorly. This was a good attempt, but it had ridiculous presentation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Red Dawn starts like any other day in a small Colorado town, however the normal tranquillity is soon shattered when Russian soldiers parachute out of the sky &amp; start killing everyone. In a systematic coordinated attack right across America starting in Mexico allied Soviet &amp; Cuban forces have invaded the US &amp; World War III has begun. Brother's Jed (Patrick Swayze) &amp; Matt Eckert (Charlie Sheen) along with several of their high school buddies manage to escape the initial invasion &amp; make it to the relative safety of the Colorado mountains. With no option but to fight the teenagers take arms &amp; wage their own personal war against the Soviet Cuban scum who have invaded their homeland &amp; killed innocent Americans...Co-written &amp; directed by avid gun collector &amp; pro-gun activist John Milius one has to say that I really didn't think too much of this overly sentimental teenage action film. The script by Milius &amp; Kevin Reynolds takes itself deadly seriously &amp; is very pro the right to bear arms all the way, it says that the right of each American to own a gun is good because America is the land of the free &amp; in the event of an attack by the Russians or any other evil superpower individual Americans will be able to defend themselves. I suppose Red Dawn tries to tap into the fears people had at the time, fears about Cummunism, about Russia, about World War III, about nuclear warfare, about increasing legislation in owning a gun which Red Dawn repeatedly says owning a gun is every American's God given right &amp; the whole survivalist movement. The character's aren't great, there's the clichéd action film theme of ordinary people being thrust into an extraordinary situation &amp; having to toughen-up &amp; overcome the odds, you know the sort of thing I mean. Nothing really works that well, while watching it last night I just thought it was a collection of seemingly random incidents stringed together &amp; you never get to know any of the character's, in fact I couldn't really name them now as I couldn't really tell them apart. The film never leaves the confines of the Colorado town either &amp; I for one never really felt like the whole of the US was at war. At almost two hours it felt like it went on forever, the action isn't anything special &amp; it's hard to believe a group of teenagers could take on &amp; defeat a heavily armed platoon of highly trained soldiers. I read somewhere once that someone thought Red Dawn resembled The Goonies (1985) but with guns &amp; rocket launchers which I think is actually quite an apt description.Director Milius nails his allegiances down here, there are some really nauseating scenes of gross patriotism which I found rather laughable. The scene of the teenagers listening to the radio &amp; the American national anthem comes on to keep the nations spirits up is just so forced &amp; cheap it's untrue. Red Dawn was the very first film released with a PG-13 rating in the states, The Flamingo Kid (1984) was actually the first film to be given a PG-13 but Red Dawn ended up being released before it. There is a fairly high body count &amp; a fair amount of blood too although it's not that graphic it is quite violent &amp; whether Red Dawn would still get a PG-13 today is debatable. Amazingly the term 'Red Dawn' was the given code name for the military operation in Iraq that captured Saddam Hussein back in 2003!The film is well made with decent production values, the military vehicles &amp; the like look very authentic I suppose &amp; the New Mexico location shooting has some nice scenery. There are several sizable parts of the film which are subtitled. The acting is in my opinion very poor, the likes of Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen in his film debut, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson, Harry Dean Stanton &amp; Powers Boothe are capable of much better than this &amp; some of the performances are truly dire.Red Dawn is not a film that I can say I liked, it's pro-war pro-gun patriotic nonsense that has dated very badly &amp; is a bit of a chore to sit through in one sitting. Apparently set to be remade as Red Dawn (2010).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a liberal, so I'm not going to pretend I'm not disgusted by the right-wing bias present here. But really, "Red Dawn" is quite a terrible movie. It really is quite hard to believe that the man who wrote this tripe co-wrote the phenomenal script for "Apocalypse Now", which really is one of the greatest films ever made. I guess I couldn't believe it till I noticed that Milius was also behind worse movies than "Red Dawn", laughable, pathetic attempts at propaganda I'd seen late at night on some cable network. It is important to recognize that "Red Dawn" was the first film to be released with a PG-13 rating (the only thing about this movie that can be called important in any way). The performances are ludicrous. Patrick Swayze, after a series of poor films, and one good one (The Outsiders), provides a joke of a performance,as do everybody else, including Charlie Sheen in his worst role yet. The rest of the actors aren't notable at all and have gone on to forge successful careers in horrible made for TV movies. However, you have to say that "Red Dawn", and especially its script, rarely go above TV movie quality. The plot? Commies invade Colorado! My Lord, that is the most genius plot I've ever heard of. The Soviets have somehow found a way to invade Colorado completely undetected. Wait, the best part hasn't arrived yet. The cast are a bunch of high school students who become guerrilla warfare experts overnight. Of course, the movie suggests that the Commies would have taken control if these heroes didn't have weapons, and hence, that democrats want you to die at commie hands because they want to take your guns away. That idea is of course, completely ridiculous, but then again, so is "Red Dawn".3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I should first explain that this movie came out when I was in the 10th grade and John Hughes was the only director who seemed to understand what it was like to be a teenager in the '80's. We were also a bit paranoid about what the Russians might do, ticked that they were still in Afghanistan and then had the gall to boycott the Olympics in L.A. The Russians were the bad guys and in those days bad guys were a lot easier to identify.So, combine all of these elements and what you get is RED DAWN. Russians were the bad guys, parents were helpless and the kids were the only ones who could save the U.S. -- or at least a small corner of it.Did the movie work back then? No, and for a lot of reasons that have nothing to do with the films premise. Other than the initial assault on the town at the beginning of the movie it takes over 40 minutes to get any sense of how bad things are around the rest of the country or how the Russian's managed to gain control of the mid-west with a handful of tanks, some Spanish speaking communists and a couple of helicopters.This film is little more than an adolescent fantasy that collapses under the weight of a weak script and by-the-numbers direction. RED DAWN could have been much more but instead serves as little more than a companion piece to the ABC mini-series "Amerika," another hopelessly dated relic of the 80's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who has ever been in the military OR has studied military history knows that for a successful aggressive invasion, you have to have a 2:1 superiority. Let's lower the numbers SIGNIFICANTLY and assume that the invaders could have conquered with a ratio of 0.5-1 (absolute craziness--however, I am willing to "suspend disbelief").Since this movie (by the movie's own script line) states that nuke usage was kept to a minimum and "we are now in a conventional war"--assuming this true, then the Soviet/Cuban and Nicaraguan (what a laugh) troop invasion force strength would have had to be around 70,000,000 (70 MILLION) troops. This also assumes that the CAPABLE fighting population of the US would have been around 140 million (eliminates babies, the elderly, sick, and kids under the age of 8). That would have been a piece of cake given the 1984 demographics.BTW: One of the targets that was taken out was apparently Washington, DC. Who came up with this target? You never take out the decision making center because at some point, if your invasion WERE successful, you need to have politicians to make peace terms.So the Soviets have 70 million versus 140 million. Next question, How does the Soviet Union manage to move 70 million troops (oh yeah....how about all that heavy equipment....tanks, armored troop carriers, etc) to the CONUS {Continental United States)?That is a heck of a lot of troops to move into the US. Something was mentioned about using commercial aircraft for the initial wave. A 747 back then would have held about 350 to 380 persons depending on the configuration. If you wanted to move even a million troops in for the first wave on international flights....do the math yourself.I don't have any problems with "feel good" movies and I agree with those who have posted on here that one of the reasons it would be so difficult to invade and take the US would be precisely because HUGE population groups would become militia and fight using guerrilla tactics. There is no doubt about that.I just have a certain level where I can "suspend" my disbelief.BTW: We were heavily supporting El Salavdor back at that time. Somehow, the Nicaraguan "army" was able to move right thru without our US troops and the El Salvador military making any efforts to stop them.I give the film a 2 out of 10 for SERIOUS FILM ratings. This film is not even close to the league of films like "The Third Man", "The Shankshaw Redemption", and even "Saving Private Ryan". So the IMDb really ought to allow TWO film ratings.....no way to compare something like this to classics.However, in terms of "unintended" consequences, this film is a good one to kick back and laugh at (the "unintended" points). So my "Cult" film rating would be 7 out of 10.This is sort of like "Taps" with an actual invasion. I wonder why they did not get some of the cast from Taps to star in this one?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was absolutely horrible! Near the beginning I thought it was interesting. I was glad that the teens were fighting back for their country. As the movie went on, my opinion drastically changed. They turned in to emotionless killing machines! They transformed into the enemy. It was highly immoral and psychologically disturbing. Not only that, the dialogue and character relationships was unrealistic and corny. The only pros I see about the movie was that the action scenes were done well (except for all the unrealistic writing of WOLVERINES on every last thing) and there were beautiful landscaping shots. Other than that, it was a complete waste of my time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did you ever wonder why Republicans are so opposed to gun registration? This movie explains it perfectly: When the Cubans and Soviets arrive, they will use the registration forms to track down the weapons of lawful owners and confiscate them, leaving them defenseless.How about all the fuss over illegal immigration? It's because those people who are picking lettuce, processing meat, and cleaning Wal-Mart are secretly infiltrating the U.S. in order to open the doors for the rest of the hordes when the time is right.Why do Republicans gladly allot obscene sums for obsolete weapons systems while tens of millions go without health care and schools and city infrastructures crumble? It's because as Red Dawn so clearly illustrated, we're just one failed wheat harvest away from a full-scale invasion, and any town could fall victim. Even if you live in a mountain hamlet thousands of miles from the border, you could be rounded up and sent off to the local drive-in while your enemies roll around town in the mayor's newly camouflaged Cadillac.Irrational fear makes people act in irrational ways. Red Dawn is basically a live-action G.I. Joe episode, but I gave it 3 stars out of 10 because it so perfectly displays what so many people are really afraid of, stripped of all code language and pretension. If you think this is a ridiculous statement, sort these reviews by "loved it" and read some of them (and there are a LOT from which to choose!) Even a quarter century after this movie debuted, there are a whole lot of people out there who don't find the scenarios in this movie all that implausible, and they vote and lobby accordingly.The only thing I can't understand is how the "Fight for our freedom/support the troops crowd" could have missed the most obvious and fitting point in the whole movie: PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO BE INVADED BY FOREIGNERS AND THEY WILL FIGHT TO THE DEATH IN ORDER TO REPEL THE INVADERS. The Cuban colonel actually makes some good points throughout the movie, the most salient coming when he explains to the Russian commander that every time a civilian is killed, the revolution grows. If you like the 80s, watch this movie for the nostalgia. If you like Ferris Bueller and Dirty Dancing, watch the movie to see the casts in other roles. If you like the A-Team and G.I. Joe cartoons, watch this because it's basically the same thing.If you like watching American Values triumph over leftism, watch this movie, because there's definitely enough of that to go around with plenty left over for seconds. Then slap yourself in the face and realize that SAME SITUATION IN RED DAWN IS GOING ON FOR REAL IN IRAQ, ONLY THIS TIME, WE'RE CUBA AND Russia! And if a handful of people in their late 20s playing high-schoolers can hold off every communist in the western hemisphere and about a million more from Russia, what do you think will be the fate of our troops who are facing millions of people who have had loved ones tortured and killed and their country reduced to squalor???</fullReview>

Favourite scene? **minor spoiler** The heroes sneak back to the outskirts of their town after they have fled the initial assault. Observing from a safe distance they see half the buildings on fire and Russian armoured vehicles patrolling the streets. One hero turns to another and with absolute seriousness speaks the immortal line: "Nothing will ever be the same again". I have never laughed quite so long and loud at anything in the cinema since. Such banality! Such a failed attempt at heroics! Such bad acting! Such a load of ****!Unfortunately, the rest of the film is little better. The whole invasion scenario is implausible and the film does little other than pander to the prejudices of Middle America militia freaks.Watch it once for the (unintentional) comedy but NEVER assume that the story depicted could have even the remotest connection with reality.</fullReview>

Contrary to what some people may think today, the old Soviet Union was capable of pulling off an invasion like this. They would have used all of their assets, such as the Cubans. The description of what happened as told by Powers Boothe, was very probable. I know what the Soviets were capable of doing. I spent six years of my life teaching other soldiers what they were capable of doing. The movie wasn't perfect. The old French Resistance codes should have been left out. But all in all, it is a pretty good depiction of how a resistance movement is formed. And by the way, this ISN'T what's going on in Iraq today.</fullReview>

I have watched it many times.Consider: Collaboration with the occupiers. Young people as the most passionate among the resistance. Conflicted occupiers, some believing themselves righteous and others with doubts. Ambush as the main tactic of the resistance. Resistance fighters operating right under the noses of the occupiers. Occupiers baffled by what they see as an alien culture. Soldiers of the occupied country clandestinely helping the resistance.Now think about Iraq and Afghanistan and who the Wolvlerines are there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Evidently some people who have commented on this movie have no appreciation for the price of freedom. They haven't lost loved ones, or had to bleed or die to protect their family or country. That's what this movie is about. Struggle against tyranny. Starving out on cold mountain tundra and burning with thirst in the blistering desert, yet tightening the belt and marching on because all you have left is each other. It's about the man/woman/friend next to you and the bond you have formed. It is struggle for ones very survival. This movie depicts how most wars of independence have been fought. Not by great generals or progressive minds but by the young who gave their lives dying for what they believed in/held dear. In that aspect this movie stands out. It captures the friendship, the loss, the desperation, the unclaimed heroics of freedom fighters and patriots. The very first scene of Russian soldiers landing outside a high school put me on the edge of my seat. The kids flight to a family members business where they were armed and provisioned. The hideout in the mountains and the story of the resistance movement they formed is incredible. I highly recommend that everyone watch this movie and maybe they will appreciate the freedom they take for granted each and every day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Red Dawn tells the story of a communist invasion of the United States in the 80's and how a bunch of teenagers join forces to fight them using guerrilla tactics to avenge the loss of their families. The whole premise is a bit silly to be honest. Starting with the invasion which is never truly explained and seems far too easy to the fact that unexperienced high school students could be so competent guerrilla fighters with no training or combat background. In the first few combat scenes its hard not to think they would be dead in a few seconds even with the surprise attacks the movie shows to try to mitigate its own lack of credibility in this plot point. But hey, its a movie so I guess we can get pass that and enjoy. Only problem is that even if you do suspend disbelieve, Red Dawn is still a lukewarm affair. For a movie with so many action scenes and all well shot I must say, its still all a bit dull and slow moving until it reaches a weak ending without much closure. The movie takes itself very, very seriously, spews a bit of propaganda and ends up being more depressing and boring than intense and fun. The only interest comes from seeing a well known cast before they were truly stars. They all act well despite their youth and do their best with Patrick Swayze being superb in the lead. Also interesting is seeing Swayze acting with Jennifer Grey before Dirty Dancing and C. Thomas Howell full of promise before falling in B-Movie hell. Red Dawn is a decent movie. It has enough action to satisfy any action fan and the script is solid enough. Its just too dark, too preachy and too serious. It asks too much of the viewer and doesn't have enough of a payoff to merit it. Its a work of its time period and a relic that has not aged well in this day and age. Its more interesting as a portrait of old political times and views than as a piece of entertainment.</fullReview>

In one scene of the original first time I saw this movie, a solder bring their commander his uniform on a hanger, and says "tu uniforma," and the commander takes it. In the DVD I bought from the store, that don't happen at all, no uniform, and no line for the actor. As well as other things.Sorry to say, I have noticed this same thing on DVD's of other movies, not all of course.The actor who plays the History Teacher in the opening, does a very fine job of getting your attention, then taking you along with him as he goes outside.In the 1940's I saw a movie "China's Little Devils," and Red Dawn reminded me of it, it is still one of my favorites.

		<fullReview>"Red Dawn" starts with a few title cards that provide some background to the story that is about to happen. How a terrible wheat harvest one year started unrest in the USSR and the Eastern Bloc, as well as the rise of Communist forces in South America. Why would a film do this? Well to provide some credible backing for the plot, to give it a sense of realism as if it is ripped from current headlines. It is a pretty good effect. We next see Red Army troops parachute down near a school in a nice tranquil part of small town USA start to gun down all-American school kids.Frankly that's where the film turns from "political thriller" to "nonsense action movie." It also makes one wonder, why did they bother with the "realistic" set up, which was supposedly based on actual military hypothetical scenarios, when for the rest of the movie is one preposterous action scene after another? The entire focus of the movie is how demonic and cruel the Soviets are and how courageous American school kids are. Red Army soldiers are callously gunned down and destroyed in every which way, while each death on the American side is met with sappy drama and grievance. The combat scenes are wholly preposterous and in one scene one of our young heroes actually aims at an approaching gunship with an assault rifle firing from the hip whilst yelling his battle cry. Too bad for him that the gunship is at least one hundred yards away, which, for the pilot isn't very far, but for someone shooting an assault rifle, that's a considerable distance to be blindly spraying bullets and hoping to hit the intended target. Basically, the film attempts to fool its audience with the opening title cards as there is not one hint of realism after the first shot fades in."Red Dawn" just plays out as a gun lovers action movie with the unnecessary back drop getting in the way of every scene. John Woo's "Hard Boiled" is also a gun lovers action movie, but it has style, it has it's unique feel and just enough plot to keep it going and most important of all it never attempted to be realistic with any sort of background on crime rates in Hong Kong. It was made to accepted as it progresses. "Red Dawn" has very little action movie creativity and style with the "realistic" attempt at a plausible Cold War plot being nothing more than blunt force mediocrity.There is also the fact, mainly revealed by hindsight after the USSR's collapse, that by 1984 the Soviet Union was in no shape to conduct such an invasion and, in fact, imported most of its wheat - thus didn't rely on its own harvest - and that makes the whole film genuinely absurd and practically a parody of its own paranoid notions. --- 5/10BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- violence</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have to remember before watching Red Dawn that it was made in 1984 - a time when the Cold War had yet to thaw. Hence, you have what is nothing short of an American propaganda film. The idea of a Soviet Union lead coalition invading America was unrealistic even at the time but it nevertheless leads to a very fascinating premise for a film.The opening scene with the Cuban army parachuting onto America soil and the Soviet army parading through the streets after successfully occupying the city are excellent.There are probably just a few too many corny clichés within the film for it to be considered a classic but it also surprisingly doesn't hold back on some genuinely gruesome moments too.In terms of war films, it doesn't come anywhere near to the likes of Apocalypse Now or Saving Private Ryan. But Red Dawn still remains a film that's worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The premise the United States being invaded by conventional war in the 20th or 21st Century is fascinating. The last foreign country to invade the United States was Britain in the War of 1812. There have been numerous movies made about the U.S. involved in nuclear war, or invaded by space aliens, but none have portrayed how a conventional war might be waged on American soil by foreign countries."Red Dawn" is a product of it's time (1980's), depicting the enemy as Russian, Cuban and Nicaraguans. The movie itself focuses on a group of teenagers in a rural isolated area in the shadow of the Rocky Mountains. The cast, including Charlie Sheen and C. Thomas Howell are earnest enough and the action sequences are good enough to keep you watching.From a 2004 perspective, looking forward over the next 50 years, it's possible to construct a scenario where nuclear weapons have been banned, and global warming creates food and water shortages leaving the United States ripe for a conventional invasion by hugely populated foreign countries (China, Latin America). A remake of "Red Dawn" focusing on a near future invasion by China fighting through California and urban warfare through the cities of the Northeast is a movie I'd pay to see.In the end, "Red Dawn" gets credit for stimulating the imagination and will hopefully give birth to a similar premised movie of the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've noticed some users have written this off as a right-wing rant. I've given enough decent scores to movies with painfully obvious left-wing rants to know a movie can be good, even if you disagree with the political message.This movie explores what would happen in a Communist invasion of the US. Unlike brainless movies like Rambo or Invasion USA, this movie gives depth to characters on both sides and explores interesting questions. It remains believable with regard to the fighting. Although the kids who form a resistance are pretty amazingly good at it, it doesn't turn into something where the hero just gets knocked over by a bomb and the enemy can't shoot straight.A number of the main characters were portrayed by actors who went on to have quite distinguished careers. The acting is good, even if the writing seems a little contrived at times.Probably the biggest negative is that it is now dated. There is no longer a Soviet Union (or anyone else) that could pose such a threat to the US, at least for now. This might make the movie less interesting to younger viewers who did not live through the Cold War.</fullReview>

Some cheesy dialogue, ham fisted acting, and some very young stars make it seem like something to avoid, but give it a chance.

		<shortDescription>My goodness you kids with this political stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps I am too laid back but I see this film as just a interesting action "B" movie playing on American fears of the 1980s and cold war era. I remember when I first saw this movie when I was a teenager after hearing about it from friends and talking about how cool it would be to have freedom like the kids in the movie did while fighting a common enemy. However, upon re-watching it on TV, I still see it as a fairly decent action movie that's interesting enough to watch. I consider myself strongly left wing and liberal and I do see propaganda and some interesting paranoia themes but every movie has a view point and this one just takes a sort of conservative view if that's how you see it. This movie is kind of lame in that the dialogue is corny and some of the writing, directing and editing is questionable but outside of that it's not bad. At some points some of the incoherent politics do get on my nerves, however I just picture the kids fighting aliens, lol. Anyone who tries to make anything political out of this movie is looking for a fight and a vehicle to express their opinion, I think anyway. So like I said, this film is a just a decent "B" movie to kill a afternoon with by watching some of the nifty action scenes and making fun of Patrick Swayze, now at a time when this type of fear is past us as Americans (there is no terror threat and even if there was it has nothing to do with this movie, that would be like saying Back to Bataan is relevant and teaches us to be ever vigilant), we should just watch these kind of movies and go with it, like watching World War Two John Wayne Films. Now go watch this film pilgrim, and in closing I think I've managed to offend and disagree with both sides of the argument of this film, so good for me and the left and right political peoples that lurk these boards looking for stuff to complain about need to relax, it's just film and film is different to each through their interpretation and opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That is your premise. Isolated Colorado teens discover the US has been the victim of a sneak attack and Russian troops aided by Cubans have actually invaded in full force. American regular citizens find themselves taking up arms in a guerilla war against the invaders. Although this was widely interpreted to be the NRA's dream for a movie there are some interesting characterizations to be found here. Real problem is that the initial premise is not plausibly presented so the whole work just comes off as teen fantasy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its funny, I looked at reviews on this site for this film prior to and after 9-11-01. People before 9-11-01 said it sucks horribly, people after 9-11-01 commend this movie for its realistic portrayal of Americans when we are "invaded". This view is exactly what the producers of this movie wanted; to show Americans what happens when we get invaded and how we can strike back. To tell you the truth, when I woke up on 9-11-01 and heard about and saw what was happening and all the talk of America being "invaded" I immediately began to think of this film....Ok, maybe the acting was pretty bad in some places (notably Lea Thompson and Patrick Swayze) but the character Robert (C. Thomas Howell) definitely makes up for it. He is a true example of what the typical American would become under these circumstances; a trigger happy, out-for-revenge, die-honorably patriot. I saw this movie long before 9-11-01 and honestly the events of that day have made me appreciate this film more. A must see. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, I've said that this movie is not realistic at all. That this never could happen. After 9-11-01, I am not so sure. We HAVE been invaded and thousands WERE killed. What will happen next time? Who will be hit next?I thought about this movie that day while looking at the attack on the World Trade Center played over and over again on TV. Seeing the rubble and hearing the stories of what happened. The real story of a group of people on a plane. They knew they were going to die BUT banded together to save others(on the ground) from the same fate of those Trade Center crashes. Brave and couragous like those in "Red Dawn". Fighting against the bad guys and for the good ol' USA. They were heros! This film is a good mirror of that story and only helps make it more poignant. It also includes a good cast of up and coming stars. Let us all pray that it never gets this bad. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Annoying hunting practices are postulated by this script that I've never seen in twenty-five years of hunting (a sophomoric get-blood-on-you ritual) but generally this "future history" is remarkable. First, it's unusual for a big-budget film to get made without political correctness killing any such competing statement. Second, it's a valid cold war warning, since the old Soviet Union used exactly the methods shown to take over countries nearer to them, challenging US geographic safety with a what-if scenario. Then, you have a general countering of the "It Can't Happen Here" attitude which, since the Trade Center disaster, MIGHT mute that effect for about 30 days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On Thursday, Sept. 13, I found myself thinking about this movie. I was in Blockbuster trying to find some movies for distraction from the news onslaught. My children needed a break even more than I did. So, while I ended up with more light-hearted fare, this movie popped into my head for obvious reasons.I'm not in a big hurry to show it to my children. I feel that under current circumstances, my eight year-old might perceive the plot of Red Dawn as something more to worry about. However, I remember watching it when I was about 17 and feeling pride. I knew that if I was put in that horrible predicament, my behavior would be similar to the young characters in the film.That's what I thought then, and that is what I still believe today. God forbid we should have to experience further acts of WAR on our soil, but if so, I know that Americans will fight?.and be victorious over terrorism!!God Bless America!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated and very relevant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1984, I was 19 years old, and attending military college. A week after I started, the Soviets shot down KAL007. A couple of years later, we bombed Libya. Iran-Contra, Nicaragua, and Lebanon were common news items. Every day, the Cold War was the major part of the news, and I was studying and training to take my place as an officer of the US military. I eventually decided not to take my commission, and instead entered law enforcement. But the fact is, I lived that period of time, and RED DAWN seemed to be plausible, if a bit inaccurate. I really love this movie, because if it ever came down to going man-to-man with the invaders, it really would be mostly the civilian population fighting as resistance forces, because the business of training combat troops is long, and if you're constantly suffering casualties, it's bloody too. And yes, high school kids could become effective guerrillas after a while. Like anything else, practice makes perfect. Yes, it's got cheesy dialogue, and Patrick Swayze is doing a Charlton Heston impersonation, but it is accurate in its portrayal of everyday people doing what has to be done to have freedom. Do you think that the French Resistance in WW2 was made up only of trained soldiers? Do you think the Viet Cong was mostly a full-time, professional army? More importantly, do you think that most of the soldiers during the Revolutionary War were full-time professionals? Throughout history, most armies were made up mostly of citizen-soldiers who served only in time of crisis. You'll see that in such movies as BRAVEHEART and THE PATRIOT. The idea that the Soviets and their allies could not pull this plan off is only partially true. If the US had allowed their forces to be run down, to the point that radars don't work and missiles can't be launched, this could have happened. Remember, most Americans believed in 1941 that no enemy could strike the naval base at Pearl Harbor without being spotted. I believe they made a couple of movies about that little incident, too. By the way, for those reviewers who remarked on the non-involvement of the British in RED DAWN, if you remember when Powers Booth is telling the kids about what happened at the beginning of the war, one of them asks him who is on our side. He says something along the lines of, "The British, but they won't last too much longer. And 600 million screaming Chinese!" The kid (Danny, I think) says, "I thought there were a billion Chinese?" The colonel says, "There were!" By the way, during that period of history, the Soviets had some 60 or 70 divisions deployed along the Chinese border, and had actually fought a small skirmish with the Chinese in 1969 in that region. So RED DAWN may seem dated today, but for 1984 it was pretty accurate in portraying what could have been. And, to be honest, the same concerns still exist today, although the threat now is not from the tanks of the Soviet Army, but from rogue states and terrorists. Ignore this movie's message at your own peril.</fullReview>

It's a great concept, of what if a Soviet invasion of mid-america happens. The cultural differences between the 2 communists and middle America, or the heartland. Its nice to watch Jed's character, represnet the heartland, and how hard of a time it would be to take over a country where there is gun in every household, and alot of ex military, bushmen type of people around. You would have about as hard of a time pacifying America as the British did. In the end the movie boiled down the culture, values, and bonds of these people, that is what this films about more then how accuratly such a event would happen.</fullReview>

It offers an interesting "What if?" scenario and does raise one or two moral questions. The story keeps up a good pace and the action sequences are well done.

		<shortDescription>Very good "What-if ?" action/war flick during the Cold War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When "Red Dawn" came out in 1984, the American public was wary of going to war. The end of the Vietnam War a decade earlier still resonated as a big loss for the U.S. Communists had been succeeding in capturing states in other areas around the globe. The Soviet Union had equaled or surpassed the U.S. in its nuclear arsenal. It showed no signs of weakness yet. The Soviets were aiding insurrections in Nicaragua and elsewhere, as they had supported North Vietnam. The red menace was very real. Just two years earlier, Great Britain had gone to war with Argentina after that South American country invaded the Falkland Islands on April 2, 1982. No foreign army had ever attacked or taken an inch of American soil since the War of 1812. Was it possible that it could happen now? Might another country or coalition of nations now be strong enough to attack the U.S.? The stage was set; and so the time was ripe for a film such as "Red Dawn."Others have discussed the story, acting and other details of the movie. Liberal critics panned the film. Those caught up in a growing wave of young patriotism liked it. Most people, in neither camp, enjoyed it for what it was. And "Red Dawn" didn't disappoint as a film about survival and fighting off an invading force. With its cast of mostly young up and coming actors, "Red Dawn" was the number 10 film in U.S. box office gross for 1984. It had one of the best returns for budget for the year. Its budget was $4.2 million and it grossed $38.4 million in the U.S. Although he is a libertarian in many aspects, director/writer John Milius is hawkish on war, military, and terrorism. He had a penchant for realism and accuracy. So, some of the best work for this film was in the recreation of Russian tanks, other vehicles and armament. The young cast went through eight weeks of training to learn about military tactics, and to learn to fire and break down the various weapons. Former Army Captain Dale Dye of Warriors Inc. was military adviser for the film, and designed the basic training program for the cast. Young people today may dismiss the Cold War (1947-1991) as nothing more than a time of political tension and verbal jousting among the world's super powers. But those who study history will learn of the real threats and dangers that lurked during that time. And of the genuine worry about possible war in the public arena, especially, in the U.S. Those who lived during the Cold War period can recall events that raised the specter of a possible third world war at any time. I recall the air- raid drills in the 1950s grade school when we would scramble to get under our desks. It's OK to laugh about it today, but the public specter of someone accidentally pushing a button that would start World War III was very real. "Red Dawn" was a very good film that gave us an action-packed and thoughtful look at a what-if scenario following an invasion of the U.S. In that regard, it was highly successful and entertaining. This film was in the days before computer-generated imagery. It shows how much more realistic movies appear when authentic equipment or replicas are built and used for films. This film is an excellent example. It's one of the last films to use extensive recreations of authentic weapons and war machines. The film was shot mainly in the Arapaho National Forest of Colorado, and in and around the town of Las Vegas (population about 15,000), New Mexico. Bonus video clips with the DVD of the film have interviews with actors, directors and technical folks. The bonus items give good information on the replicas, special effects work, and shooting locations. It's still a good film to watch these many years later.</fullReview>

That says it all I think. In 1984, it was not terribly far-fetched to a 14 year-old that this could happen, because we really were that concerned about the Soviet Union back then. Nobody could have convinced me that the Soviets wouldn't exist by the time I started college. For that matter, nobody in the world could have been convinced of that. The collapse of the Soviet Union caught the entire world by surprise, and that is the one fact that people overlook when watching this film now.

We laughed, yelled and went outside and played some hoops after.Overall ranks high in my 80's movies. The premise is interesting in how would Americans react if invaded on their own soil.

		<fullReview>True, this movie was made at the end of the cold war era, when fear towards the Soviet Union was fading. My guess is that the goal of this film was make sure Americans at the time didn't forget who public enemy number one was (of course I am the screenwriter, so I can't know that for certain.) Don't get me wrong, I enjoy this movie. It has good action scenes, and also some really heart wrenching scenes.But it has just as many scenes that make you slap your forehead and shout DOH! I'm sure that if Soviets were going to drop in and take over, one of the first things they'd do is defile our women. Oh and the dialogue! The dialogue was unnatural and sounded like a high schooler wrote it. And why were these kids the only ones who attempted to escape when the Soviets dropped and started killing people? That has never sat well with me.What really bothers me about this movie is its lack of character development. They had great acting talents in this movie, and failed to utilize it. Who were the major characters? Honestly, they managed to make a movie with no major characters. The last time I watched this movie, I often found myself asking how the heck they got to this point. Meaning that the movie jumps around from month to month, making the time flow difficult to follow, and character development non-existent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hardly a movie is easier to despise for its premise. If the idea is to push another Red Scare -- well, at least it's not the dreadful "Amerika" miniseries. But it is a silly premise which mars a movie that even without this feature is mediocre at best. A small band of partisans cannot defeat a well-disciplined, ruthless army such as that of the USSR in the early 1980s. They can make life miserable for occupiers, but they are highly unlikely to survive.You can hate this movie for its premises (a political bias), but you must admit that Soviet techniques of overthrowing a country were similar to those in Red Dawn, as was their treatment of any resistance. Note well that the anti-communist resistance ends up using the same techniques of partisan warfare as those that the Soviet partisans used against the Nazis.Would a movie with such a concept as "Brown Dawn", in which partisans resisted a nazi invasion have made as much sense? Sure -- and as such one has "science fiction, category alternative history", because, mercifully, the Nazis never got a chance to invade America. I can imagine some moonshiners running into trouble with the Gestapo over the smuggling of contraband (including the human sort) out of the occupied Atlantic region, refusing to pay "occupation taxes", and keeping their children from attending nazi propaganda mills formerly known as public schools. "Red Dawn" must now be relegated to the "science fiction, alternative history" category because of its obsolescence as prophecy. All science fiction depends upon suspension of disbelief, which requires esthetic achievement or well-hidden didactic value.&gt;Red Dawn&lt; lacks these qualities altogether and thus fails.</fullReview>

It tries to be some sort of serious film full of emotions and philosophy and stuff. Charlie Sheen had practically an identical role in "Hot Shots, part deux", but at least there he knew it was a comedy. Most of this cast probably wishes that every copy of this movie would be thrown into the ocean. I guess the "red" in the title is the color of their faces after appearing in this embarrassment of a movie, and "dawn" is when it dawned on them how awful it was. Avoid, unless it is being shown at 3am and there is nothing else on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An anachronism, with political undertones, but still fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will admit that this story seems like a ridiculously dark fantasy dreamed up by a right-wing wacko now. Most liberals will consider this laughable - and I agree with that, being slightly left-of-center myself.However, it's unfair to judge this movie without understanding the historical context. This was a time when Ronald Reagan was calling the Russians' bluff. A time when the nuclear war clock read "5 minutes to midnight". A time, months after North America (OK, I'm Canadian) had watched a miniseries of nuclear holocaust, "The Day After".If you can escape into this contemporary paranoid context, I think you can have fun watching this movie.It's a film that captures the paranoia of the times, like "The Manchurian Candidate" or "On The Beach" during the Cuban Missile Crisis, even though it doesn't stand strongly in comparison to those works of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good propagandist movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie two or three times and rated it movie 10, because I think it's a well made one. I am perfectly aware that the story is paramount unrealistic and forced one. It's a good example of propaganda, showing that even in a democratic country heavily propagandistic and jingoistic films are likely to pop up once in a while... The US were about to win the so-called "Cold War". Still, there was someone reckoning the imminent victory not to suffice.. Another nice propagandist - this time well placed with the then historical realistic menaces hovering over the World - is "Where do We go from Here?" (1945; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038245/), starring Fred MacMurray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The tragic events of today (most unfortunately) prove that the premise of this movie is NOT far fetched. Those who are offended by this movie should watch the news. Although the circumstances are different, they do bare some eerie similarities. If New York could have lost so many lives in one day by a group of terrorists, why does it seem so unlikely that Guerrillas from two different countries could do the same or worse damage. Can you believe that people protested this movie? Why? John Milius dared to do something different, it was a strong plot and good actors/actresses. It's easy for anti-N.R.A. types to say that the movie was awful but that must be because they don't understand it or are in denial about certain political agendas to take guns away from average people. Regardless of that, it isn't about that. What's so unbelievable about human survival? Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, Charlie Sheen, Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey all give great performances. The horrible events of today prove that tragedy like we saw on every news channel, tragedy of unthinkable proportions can happen. Rent this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a "Saving Private Ryan" or "Band of Brothers," skip this. If, however, you want to ponder the possibilities of what we once thought impossible, with a little adventure and tension thrown in, you should catch this film. Even though the whole "small group of kids vs the world" is an over done concept, the movie is riveting in its own way. Made in 1984, it was considered unrealistic, and some of the the events may have seemed absolutely ridiculous, but since then many things have happened in the world that give this movie an eerie sense of being possible. SPOILER WARNING: For example: The invaders use a commercial airline to sneak their soldiers in for their first invasion attack. In 1984 we would have scoffed at that idea. Since September 11th, it isn't so "laughable". The idea of sneaking massive forces in through the Mexico border was laughable in 1984. Not so much so in 2007. Europe abandoning us to take care of ourselves was another "too familiar" touch.The use of technology, the combination of "french underground" like existence and 20th century situations is fascinating to watch unfold. The film has several weak points, but its a good escape film, and it does give you a bit to think about in terms of politics and possibilities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember watching this movie when I was nine years old. I was looking out my classroom window in fear the the next five years. My brother and I, even though we fought as kids and teenagers, always said we would do whatever it takes to protect our family in friends if anything like this ever happened, as unrealistic as it might have been. In my time in the Marine Corps, I served with three of the best guys I have ever met (who are still my friends today), and we all cherished the movie Red Dawn. Many of our fellow Marines thought we were stupid for liking such a goofy movie. But how can you not like this movie? It tries to a couple of key messages - 1) Protect your home soil 2) Protect your family, no matter what the cost. If they are killed by aggressors, AVENGE THEM, or die trying!!!!!!!. I remember sitting in my barracks room at Camp Lejuene with my roommate Sgt. Brian Pennington. Our copy of Red Dawn was our prized possession, and we often quoted the movie on field exercises. Sgt. Pennington was the Platoon Sgt. And I was the Assistant Platoon Sgt. We were the senior Marines in the Barracks, and we always tried to set a good example. We were surprised to hear that many of the Jr. Marines had not seen Red Dawn, so we gathered them up and played the movie for them. We were shocked (and disgusted personally) when they said the movie was stupid, and a waste of their time. I started thinking to myself, I am not that old, but what is happening to the youth of America. Just my opinion, but this movie should somewhat inspire everybody. Either way, if you have not seen it, GO TO BLOCKBUSTER. You probably will enjoy it. By the way, those who do not like it, just go ahead and make your way to Russia, Cuba, or Nicaragua . . . .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad action movie at all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an action flick. Pure and simple. A rather good one for the genre. There is only one single reason that people are giving it one star, their political leanings. I've heard it all before, the USA is the main problem with the world, other despotic rulers are just misunderstood.Ho Chi Minh, Daniel Ortega and Fidel Castro were (are) hero's to their people and America has no right to intervene. Uncle Joe Stalin really didn't kill 20 million Ukrainians, Mao Zedong really didn't kill 100 million Chinese, and the Khmer Rough really didn't kill 2 million Cambodians. Oh, excuse me Kampucheans. The communists in Rhodesia were kind to the common people as well.However, America exports revolution to the world to support it's vast Defense Contrators' bottom lines. GWB started the Afghan and Iraq war for the enrichment of Halliburton executives at the expense of innocent Iraqis. The USA systematically targets civilians, and has since Vietnam.Hitler (the only despot these people claim to despise) was second in his evil only to "King George II." These same people are OK with killing 35+ million Americans since Roe V. Wade in 1973, but are (supposedly) against killing 7 million Jews from 1933 - 1945. I say supposedly because the left is fanatically anti-Semitic. Israel is at least as evil as America.Back to the movie. If a foreign force invaded America, I would kill them until I was killed. Just like in Red Dawn. If you notice, everyone died or was dying at the end. Most people who have recently posted on this movie would have acted like the slim-ball mayor and turned in their own sons. Pathetic how people hate the thing that allows them to hate. They have NO APPRECIATION how good it is here in America. Ever wondered why Cuban in Florida are solidly Republican? The lived under socialism and want NO PARTS of it anymore. They escaped. They appreciate America. It's a shame you don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One-dimensional Cold War propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red Dawn is about the invasion of the United States by Soviet and Cuban troops. A band of Colorado high schoolers escape the attack forces to hide in the wilderness. After witnessing the extreme inhumanity of the invaders, the high schoolers start using guerrilla tactics to fight for the United States. If you switch the labels, I could easily see this being reproduced to justify Iraqi resistance in the present war. Which is pretty sad, because this is a very shortsighted (even flawed) view on patriotism and war.It was often frustrating to watch because it is extremely unrealistic. The image of Soviets as heartless enemies is a sad idea created by the Cold War. The resistance forces (compromised of the escaped high school students) are supposed to reflect the good guys, but I found myself loathing them because of their militant ideals and merciless attacks. They are no better than the people they fight. There is no justification for anything on either side.From a technical viewpoint, the film is mediocre. The script is poor, as is much of the acting. The only thing that was really good was the costume design.I plan to never see this movie again. It has no value over being hard propaganda from a bygone age. I respect other Cold War films (such as Dr. Strangelove) for their intriguing messages. Red Dawn possesses no such message and is only a decent action movie. Pass it up.</fullReview>

As the war started a standing army was waiting on US soil to be used by foreign aggressors. If we don't keep the pressure on in the war in foreign countries as well as improve our security within our own borders the war will undoubtedly come back to US soil as it did on 911.

		<shortDescription>Dreadful but remarkably prescient</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director John Milius couldn't have imagined (or intended) that his magnum opus Red Dawn would be one of the most politically prescient films of the 1980s, but indeed it is. When a peace loving country is invaded by a distant enemy and finds its people murdered, raped, and humiliated by foreigners who can't even speak the language, it's incumbent upon the remaining citizenry (Patrick Swaye, C. Thomas Howell and others) to rise up and fight a guerrilla war against their oppressors. That resistance can take many forms, including, according to Milius' film, the use of IEDs such as the one insinuated into a tank by a girl on a bicycle and the use of hand held SAMs to shoot down helicopters. As the insurgents gain knowledge of the invaders' tactics and acquire advanced weaponry, they are better able to take the fight to the enemy by any means necessary. As a film, Red Dawn is predictable and badly written (only the presence of Powers Boothe elevates it from a '1' to a '2'), but as an educational essay on the rights and responsibilities of colonised peoples to stand up to imperial invaders, it's second only to Gillo Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8 kids taking on half of the red army, oh ya</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Are there eight kids fighting or six? I can't remember. Either way, this flick rocks (I'll even say it RAWKS). I guess the "Soviets" knew they couldn't take on the US armed forces, so they decided to take on soft targets, like public schools. Little did they know that this particular junior college was Swayze Crazy.POSSIBLE SPOILERS ************* Oh man, where do we begin with this one? I guess you could say it's a tale of survival, as the Commies try to penetrate into the heart of the fine US public school system. Of course, this flick was made a few years before it was common to have firearms in schools, so these kids were totally defenseless against this surprise attack. Good thing they outsmarted the Ruskies and confiscated some of their munitions , which they in turn successfully used against them. Maybe kids are learning something in the public schools after all.MORE SPOILERS **********Not only did these teens (or in Swayzes case, 30 year high schoolers) fight valiantly, they fought victoriously. There were some losses along the way, but hey, you're gonna take some hits when you're taking on half the Red Army. This however, begs a peculiar question: why was our country so scared of the Soviet Union if they couldn't even take over a high school? They conquered the actual building, but they let some of the students slip away, which ultimately did them in. These kids truly were heroes, as they fled into the woods, stayed the course, and fought back, even as the Soviets exported the fine art of the firing squad onto US soil, taking out Harry Dean Stanton along the way. Quite harrowing.I know I'm taking a sardonic tone, but this film's premise, though timely in 1984, is so ridiculous. It may hit home to some, especially when the US and Russia were a click of a button away from going nuclear (not pronounced NUKE YU LIR). But this film has to be taken for what it is, pure drivel. Yes, quite enjoyable, but so many of these reviewers took the movie seriously, gimme a break!!! I absolutely love this movie, it's completely over-the-top, great Cold War propaganda and unintentionally hysterical. It's almost as ridiculous as the later Death Wish films, 3-5 to be exact, though I think Charles Bronson may have had a higher body count. There is plenty of violence and gun-play to go around, so it may be too strong for the faint of heart. However, this movie has aged like white bread, so some of the excess shooting and fighting seems tame by todays standards. And frankly, if you find the fighting disturbing, you're either a peacenik or a plain coward. The director of this flick is a gun lover (God bless him), so expect to see plenty of firearms.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well i don't know if the political standpoint is different in the 1980s, but a modern audience will definitely not find this a solid picture. While Soviet troops did outnumber American ground forces in peace times by 4 to 1, an invasion is extremely unlikely considering America's higher population and more advanced air force and navy. The film shows a handful of teenagers armed with not much battling soviet tanks and helicopters and winning. It really seems cheesy when a few kids that have never received military training attack and completely overrun a Soviet base with a far higher garrison along with American prisoners. If the Russians couldn't fight at all how could they have conquered the country in the first place? it really made me laugh when the Russian general was awed at the bravery of those kids and didn't shoot them. this is an "ok" film if you have a few friends over or don't have anything better to do and not have cable and wanna see explosions and uncle Sam kick some serious *beep*, but its not worth a rental</fullReview>

That will keep us from getting hungry for all the months that we're up in the mountains.John Milnus brought us a film which combines the Reaganite "The Russians are coming" line with the NRA idea that all you need to defend your freedom is a gun and the ability to spend a little time away from electricity. The movie postulates that the Soviet bloc were able to just brush aside America's conventional and nuclear forces and land paratroops right into Colorado, with the help of illegal aliens. Not only is a racial slur involved, but the scenario is in contradiction of military logic. Drop paratroopers in the middle of a hostile country? Um -why? I only hope no one got their ideas of partisan combat from this film. To anyone who has read about the classic guerilla wars of the 20th century - Ireland, Yugoslavia, Vietnam or Afganistan, to name just a few - "Red Dawn" will come across as grippingly realistic as "Red Zone Cuba" (q.v.). Never do Patrick Swayze and his little gang have to go into town to execute collaborators, or man a roadblock to collect war taxes. Never are we confronted with the unpleasant truth that America, like every other country, has its ethnic divisions, and if these white, rural kids are acting outside the current government, it would a natural move by an occupier to recruit counterguerilla forces from their opposites. There has almost never been a irregular combat campaign that did not get ugly in ways this movie misses entirely.But I did have to admire the way no matter how tough things got, the hair of both Patrick Swayze and Lea Thompson never looked less than perfect.Apparently the hair salons were still fully functional.</fullReview>

If there was an invasion, the Soviets wouldn't of done it conventionally. Not since they had nuclear power-- this wasn't Afghanistan, for peet's sake!My father was a technical advisor on this movie and was very proud of it. To him, there "were no boring parts". But in fact, it was boring. And it was painful to watch fine actors such as Patrick Swayze, Powers Booth and Harry Dean Stanton in this mess; the plot and the events were a bit incoherent, as well as the action (see above); and the "climax" between Swayze and the Russian colonel was ridiculous! Just the other day, my girlfriend heard the word, "Wolverine" and asked if I ever saw this. I grimaced and said yes. She replied, "oh, that was sooo good!"

		<fullReview>I'd heard about Red Dawn (mythos of "most bullets ever" and such) and watched it on TBS or TNT or whatever. Hated it. Now, I enjoy a good what-if scenario as much as the next guy. I enjoy reading WWII books about "what if xxxx had died in 1943" or "what if the Germans had built a jet", but in order for any scenario like this to work, there has to be SOME semblance of possibiltiy. You can suspend disbelief only so far and believe me, this one stretches disbelief into whole new and ridiculous shapes, then it lights it on fire and dances around the ashes.So, Russia invades middle-America through Mexico?!? What, were the radar and satellite guys asleep during the buildup and invasion? Do you know how many military bases there are in Texas? Do you know how much firepower sits at sea RIGHT NOW? Given the unlikely scenario of attacking the US from the middle, the entire US Atlantic and Pacific fleets are sitting like a hammer and anvil ready to pound this mythical Russian/South American army into dust! YEESH! Logic failing. Losing mind.Ok, movies don't always have to make sense, I'll just sit back and watch a kill-the-alien or similar mess with a big smile and a beer without picking it apart. Howerver, what little ignore-the-facts rah-rah potential this movie has is swamped by the unbelievable premise, followed by the unbelievable storyline that the US military (and UK, and Canada, and etc) couldn't muster a worthy retaliation for years. Add to that the inept Russian troops, who can't seem to defend themselves in a scenario that they are trained to handle while a bunch of high-school kids rough it in the mountains with their complex weaponry and USA-USA-USA spirit. Drek. Pure Drek.The whole thing boils down to a political cartoon against gun registration. If you note in the early stages where the Russian COL orders a subordinate to gather all the registration forms from the local hunting store, and the proceedes to confiscate said guns. Our "heroes" however, manage to scrounge up some guns'n'ammo and fight back! WOO! Boy if they ever pass those gun registration laws and Russia invades us we can't say we weren't warned! I'm not going to go all pro-NRA or anti-gun here, but the message in this movie is a load. 2/10 for a few watchable scenes.</fullReview>

Even how the Soviets invaded the United States is stupid. They get into the USA on Airliners. Wouldn't air traffic controllers notice that there were a few thousand extra airplanes on radar? And how did they get all those airplanes past Western Europe. They couldn't do it by the Pacific, because the US has several territories and one state there. And why wouldn't Western Europe help? They owe it to the US for their help in WWI and WWII. Also, the Soviets knock out the Nuke silos in North Dakota and they destroy a few major cities. The US still would have hundreds mobile nukes all around the country which they wouldn't hesitate to use if the Soviets nuked US cities. The Soviets also kill 400 million Chinese. The only way they could do that is with tactical nuclear warfare. The Chinese also have nukes and would be able to nail Moscow. This story also describes the Russians as merciless, and they really aren't(especially since most of this movie took place when Gorbachev was in power).The General Plot is dumb. It taught me that if I would gather all my friends and equip ourselves with hunting rifles, we would be better than a Soviet armored cavalry division. I won't deny that the action sequences are good, but they don't make up for the stupid plot.Though my IMDB name is Boris, I'm not a Russian, and am not giving this movie a poor review because you might think i am.

I thought that Patrick Swayze was excellent in this movie as the big brother and leader of the Wolverines. I will close now by saying give this movie a chance, ignore the other users who say it is bad and check it out.. God bless America and the Wolvarines!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Brat Pack vs. the entire Armies of the Communist sector... Guess who win?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a great appreciation for John Milius' work. He wrote timeless classics such as 'The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean' and 'Apocalypse Now', and he directed great epic adventure movies like 'The Wind and the Lion' and 'Conan the Barbarian' (this one being one of my favorite '80s movies, and a 10 out of 10 in my book). And, while I'm not American and wouldn't exactly identify with American political feelings, and while I'm VERY little interested in politics, I think I could be defined as quite conservative (while I happen to be very liberal for some things). I sound like the kind of guy who would like 'Red Dawn', don't I? So I decided to ignore all its bad reviews and its terrible reputation and give it a chance. At least it would be well-directed and entertaining, I thought.God, I hadn't seen a biggest pile of c**p in a very, very long time (at least since I suffered 'The Fifth Element' in a theater, that is).Ok, I can buy the premise of the USA being invaded by the Red Army of the USSR and Cuba, back in the old Cold War days (even if it would be almost impossible to do it the way they do it in the movie). That's OK for me. But now, enter our strong, country-saving heroes: ...THE BRATPACKERS?!?!?!?!? So, half the world, with their military tactics and their tanks and weapons and all, invades the USA, and the heroes that will save the day are Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey??? Now I feel like living in the Third World: in old Europe, we'd still use our old-fashioned armies to confront the invasion. you know, we're not Americans, shame for us...Yeah, I know that in the movie our healthy, cornflakes-stuffed, beautiful-looking young kids don't defeat the entire Red Army, but they kick some Commie ass in a way a real teenager wouldn't be able to fight the evil greasy posse of 12 year olds who take all his bucks out of his little brother. Come on, then people will talk about the Rambo movies! At least Rambo is a specially-trained soldier, designed to endure the worst of war. But what's so tough with our All-American-WASP-Star-Wars-caps-wearing heroes? Maybe they return the videotapes to Blockbuster without rewinding them, that's it.Dammit, what do you Americans put in the McDonalds sauces? It makes supermen out of kiddies!And then, there's all the political, macho and patriotic silliness. Political silliness, as the opening of the movie, which tries to explain the situation that ended in the invasion, is not only laughable and impossible, but also racist, because it presents America as the only country in the world that doesn't suck (notice that even the Commies quote the great phrases of "their rivals", as does the Cuban Colonel once). Macho silliness, like in the "initiation" scene with the deer (I'm still wondering how's possible that Zucker and Abrahams missed that one for Hot Shots, it would be a howler), and, even worse, the scene with the "You'll take my gun when..." sticker in the car (did the NRA actually finance the movie?). And patriotic silliness, specially in the final scene with the flag and that ridiculous speech about how pretty babies won the WWIII.Oh, I forgot: it's BOOOORING!!! The characters just damage one Communist war machine after another, and between that, they go around weeping. That's it. 110 minutes of that, 110 minutes that seem 150. Plus, the copy I saw had no subtitles in the scenes that were spoken in Russian (I don't know if all the copies are this way). So there were two quite long scenes that I couldn't understand at all. I could explain the non-subtitling of the scene where three Russians talk each others where two or three of our heroes are hiding behind rocks, as it can be understood as that we're in the same situation as them, who don't speak Russian, but what's it with the long speech in Russian in a room filled with Russians and not a single American? What are we supposed to understand there?In sum, my vote is 1 out of 10. Avoid it at all costs, but don't avoid John Milius' actual fine works because of it. Just pretend that 'Red Dawn' doesn't exist, and let it stay dust-covered in your video store. It'll be better for everyone (specially for everyone involved).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Feel Good Patriotic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood usually produces Movies attacking the USA, but somehow this great Movie made it through the Liberal/Hate America Censors. This great Film shows how potent a Force that Freedom is. The Wolverines (as the high school kids fighting the Russians are called) are the symbolic descendants of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson as they fight Tyranny and fight to get back their country. A great scene of Survival and the concept of Total War that is needed to win is when they are deciding what to do with a Russian Prisoner. Almost everyone is thinking they can't shoot him, but then one of the kids fires his machine gun into the Russian while screaming Because We Live Here. War is Hell. So you have to Fight Like Hell to Win.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Red Dawn is a pretty good film that could have been very real in the mid 1980's. I say real because it could have been possible for the Soviets and the Cubans to invade our country. This movie has plenty of great action scenes and ones with intense drama.This movie is basically about the start of World War Three. The beginning scene is one of the most shocking of all time. A bunch paratroopers land on the school property and start shooting at people.The acting is pretty good. The brothers were played by Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen. They were pretty good.The special effects did not look that great. They looked cheesy even for the 80's.Overall, this is a great action film that everyone should like. Hopefully, the remake comes out soon. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director John Milius has created a brainless, totally proposterious action/war flick. Believe it or not it started out pretty good, students are in a high school classroom and they get raided by communists, but after that it becomes pretty dreadful. A lot of good character actors, such as Harry Dean Stanton(Alien), Powers Boothe(Nixon, Tombstone), Lane Smith(My Cousin Vinny), and even good old Ben Johnson(Shane, The Last Picture Show) are all wasted in small, thankless roles. The concept could have been interesting, but it all gets lost in horrendous dialog, and dull action. The opening scene, and a few exciting scenes are the only bright spots in the mess.

		<fullReview>Certainly not a 10, but anyone who rated this movie less than a 6 should really question themselves. I'd be under the impression that a) they simply do not like war movies, or b) they have some sort of agenda.The only complaint I have about the film is it's unrealistic barbaric portayal of the Soviet forces. Later interviews show that it wasn't Milus' intent, but it was surely was what was conveyed.That being said, the acting was more than adequate. The action was more than adequate.Unrealistically evil portrayal of the Soviet forces aside, the movie attempted to convey a realistic life behind an occupied America through the eyes of high-schoolers that had only known peace and freedom.Can anyone here honestly tell me that a couple of "kids" couldn't effectively cause terrorist-style havoc upon installations in their own country? History has proven these things to be absolutely possible yet voter after voter chimes in with "unrealistic". Put your agenda aside.Finally, how successful were they really? In the grand scheme of things they damaged an outpost and killed a couple hundred men. Absolutely not impossible. AND, hello? Those who didn't run away were KILLED. That's right, KILLED. How's that for realism?I challenge anyone to watch the movie for what it is. Agreed, the over-done portrayal as the Soviets as "bad guys" particularly through the earlier parts of the film are enough for me to drop the movie down a few points. But if you are able to watch it with an open mind, and disconnect that for a moment. Pay good attention to the visceral imagery, and the realistic portrayal of sleepy-town school kids turned immediate desperate guerilla warriors, and some pretty good acting, and maybe you'll see what I saw in the film.I think the major problem is that those who choose to dump on the movie can't get past the barbarism, which is fair, it's easy for me to keep such an open mind as an American. And perhaps it's too hard for people to believe in a good performance out of the likes of Swayze, Grey, and Sheen. But with all considered, I'd say this movie is at worst, above average.I gave it a 7.</fullReview>

Ok, when this movie came out in 1985, it probably wasn't that realistic of a film, but after the events of 9-11-01, this film hits home to alot of people. Now thinking about it hard, this movie is realistic to now more than it was in 1985(only thing is we are against the Arab's instead of the Soviet's). It's a great film anyway before this all happened. People who trashed this aren't obviously American's at all.

A movie with this type plot had never been done before which made it something of an original. The film is well paced, well filmed and doesn't bog down. Plenty of plot twists help keep it interesting. It's not exactly meant to be taken seriously yet does spark some thought.If this country were to be invaded would untrained civilians who the majority of would not have any idea about military tactics have enough fiber to grab their firearms and engage in guerrilla warfare against enemy forces that have been trained in the art of combat?It's one thing to dream it and say it but it's another thing to actually do it.

		<shortDescription>Prophetic and Daunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading some of the 250 or so comments previously posted on this forum makes me wonder where many of these people have been in the 20th Century, the century of world wars! The prophetic intuition of Milius which included in 1984 - invasions from Canada and Mexico - our now notorious all too permeable borders - is clearly due to foresight not mere sensationalist speculation. To our south, we have Castro and Chavez and to the north a country of far left America hating radicals who bend the knee to the revolutionary left without even the whimper they feel in their fear-ridden hearts.And what about the strange alliances noted in the story line; are they unrealistic? Not quite! Now in 2006 - with Iran and North Korea playing whipsaw diplomacy on the still paralyzed will of our State Department while Russia does her best to obfuscate the true details of their satellites motives and purposes, strange nuclear strategies are developing. Muslim fanatics announcing they welcome World War III surely confirm the often proved idiocy of the human intellect in regards to war as an instrument of diplomacy. Of course, the commenters to your forum apparently are too wrapped up in their escape from reality to see reality unless it comes bombing through their living room ceiling. Incidentally, I apparently am not your typical viewer; of those 250 "great movies" I have seen only 2 of the top ten, and NONE by the way of that insipid imitation of Jimmy Stevart - Tom Hanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It could have happened and it might still</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember in 1985 gripping the arms of my theater seat during the opening invasion scenes with Soviet Paratroopers falling from the sky onto a small Colorado town. The following portrayal of young people defending their families, country and way of life is what occurs in any land where a foreign power occupies. Roger Ebert reviewed this film by saying that the premise was ridiculous. Children never fight in wars.And the film would have been more accurate if it showed teenagers letting the air out of Soviet tires. What a ludicrous idea! In such a scenario any resistance would be met with the same penalty i.e. death.Many of the resistance fighters of the 20th and early 21st century have been children, I refer to the gallant people of Afghanistan during both the Soviet and current US occupation as well as to the Chinese, Fillipino (correct spelling by the way), Russian and French partisans of WWII.What I saw on the screen was what might have happen if the Soviet Block had attempted to invade our country. This kind of invasion may still occur but this time it will be our UN "allies." Currently there is a UN treaty up for a vote that will overturn the US Bill Of Rights. If signed by our ambassador and not vetoed as is expected there will be a movement to resist the treaty's implementation. As US forces may not be used against American civilians per the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 UN "peace keepers" will be mobilized to subdue the "insurgents." I assume if this film was remade today the title might be "Blue Dawn."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cold war flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are interested in a cold war era flick that explores a Communist invasion of the USA and its affects on a group of high school age kids, this is for you.And unlike what another reviewer said, the plan of the Communist invasion is revealed by a downed F-15 driver and does make sense if albeit a bit of a stretch. This film shows how common folks become partisans when their home land is occupied by force. The acting may not be Acadamy award caliber but it's not bad. Besides this stars several well known actors early in their careers.As for not winning any academy awards, remember, the Acadamy gave best costume to "Ghandi". Or as I sarcastically say, 1001 things you can do with a sheet.The DVD version offers behind the scenes footage. An interesting tid-bit was the Russian tank in the film was such a good faux that government officials inquired where they bought it, thinking it was real thing.I've found only leftists and liberals hate the film, enough said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that the liberals love to hate, because it deals with American Patriotism. However, as usual, liberals always miss the point. Instead of glamorizing war, Red Dawn shows how terrible war is, what a waste it is, and the futility of occupation. It does a descent job of depicting soldiers at their best and worst. The storyline has a few holes, but IMHO they are small holes. It is also a good primer on survival skills as well as guerrilla warfare tactics. You should keep in mind that this is an 80's flick, so it is full of all of the typical 80's goodness and badness. Also, it's fun to see a ton of stars before they were really famous. Overall, however, Red Dawn was a thoroughly enjoyable two-hours of my time.</fullReview>

History not withstanding the characters of the Mayor, a self serving turncoat; Col. Bella, a tried soldier who just wants to return home from what has become a useless fight; and Jed the young, charismatic rebel leader who all to soon feels the true weight of command, are all especially telling.

The soviets happened to be the big bad totalitarian guys to the US at the time so are the antagonists. If you analyze the film at the end the heroes are probably all dead with 1 exception (the one girl survives i think to narrate the ending). But the monument explains they helped to stem the tide of the invasion by really giving the local division fits.If you watch the film, not all the Russians and Cubans are bad, only some of them - the rest are along for the ride / under their orders. This is true of any invading force in history. Note the Cuban or Venezulan officer who lets Jed alone at the end of the film just wanting to go home (He too was sick of the war's carnage).This movie was made for domestic US entertainment, not to appease and kowtow to the rest of the world every 2 minutes. Nor to appeal to far left loons running our educational system today.Its about Freedom over Tyranny!</fullReview>

Yes, it is VERY violent. Yes, it is cheesy. But it's true saving grace are the CHARACTERS' development. Almost all of the cast went on to high profile, lucrative careers. That success is no doubt in part due to their REALISTIC, CONVINCING portrayals of hometown, USA young people. It explores war's effects on human relationships and loss of innocence in people who are contrived to remind you of someone you know. This level of character development is something that simply does not occur in Hollywood today with its' over-reliance on special effects and action-cam shots.

		<fullReview>The Red Dawn is an honest and realistic movie, the true stuff. This is what things would have looked like, if we had invaded you in 1984. (I am from Serbia, South-Eastern Europe, and we were a communist land then. I recognize the procedures, the mentality, of the invaders, I can largely follow what they say.) This film should have received several Oscars, but no, it was shunned by Americans because it was not the usual Hollywood sugary water.The Red Dawn is blood-and-truth film, but very far from the usual wish-fulfillment, formulaic production so practiced in Hollywood. It was not shown in Serbia, then, because it was politically undesirable: anticommunist. Then, years passed, communism fell, but now the movie was too old. But now in Serbia it receives some very positive reviews in the SF fandom. I should almost say: a small cult following.The film is in science-fiction genre (because of the Third World War, and nuclear weapons used in it), although it has no visible science-fictional elements -- they are only verbally mentioned. But so it is in Lord of the Flies, too.Two girls in the unit are true partisan girls. Respect them.So, if one day, within the next 100 years, perhaps in a civil-religious war turned into international war, a part of the USA territory is occupied, this is largely what WILL be done to you.

		<shortDescription>A Pro-American Movie when Hollywood loved Communism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movies is very good on several levels.It shows that even the highest ideals get corrupted with the insanity of war and killing. Killing other human beings do not leave you better but with a wound that can never be healed. I remember another Milius production (Rough Riders) and during the training of Arizona Militia, they used an Apache. The first question they asked "Have you ever killed a man", if the answer was yes, the Apache would look into the respondents eyes and verify if it were true. The point is you see the visible change in Robert, from an innocent teenager, to a stone killer. You also see this in all the characters, except Danny who was simply there by chance but did fight and later survived.Red Dawn showed that weakness invites attack from enemies.Red Dawn showed the Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Russians as enemy of freedom. This was not a popular concept in 1984 among the Hollywood elite, but they have always loved Communism for some reason, even though if I had a gun with 4 bullets and Hitler, Stalin, Lenin, Marx, and Mao stood before me: I would not shoot Hitler. This is because the other 4 are more evil. Nazis are not right wing: they became right wing because the MSM called them right wing after they attacked the Soviet Union. I personally would have destroyed Communism before Nazism.Red Dawn showed what would happen if Communism took over the United States: book burning, concentration camps, political executions, and barbarism. Taken in context of 1984, the Soviet Union was the enemy and they were expanding with great abandon. Soviets in 1984 were in Angola, Somalia, Ethiopia, Namibia, Eastern Europe, Afghanistan, Cuba, Nicaragua, Vietnam, Cambodia, Lao, Yemen, El Salvador (advisers to the insurgency). Or to put it plainly, most of the world lived under Communism and Red Dawn merely showed the same thing happening in the US that happened in other countries occupied by Communism! Soviet tactics were ruthless and they were never concerned about the "well being" of civilians.There was very good attention to detail in Red Dawn showing the "Wolverines" as young people from an rural background. City kids just don't have much fight in them usually. For those who scoff at teen-aged American kids organizing and fighting a competent insurgency against trained, professional Russian soldiers: let me remind you that the Viet Cong were uneducated farmers that raised a lot of havoc with trained and superior equipped American Soldiers. Also, the average age of the continental soldier in Washington's army was 16. Another point that Red Dawn shows, Russian Troops were never that good a fact proved in Afghanistan and Chechniya.All in all, the movie is entertaining, patriotic, and as realistic as Hollywood can get about any subject. But more it does show deeper truths. Some would make patriotism as a negative, think about what level of brainwashing would create that attitude. I would suggest if you are a film student in college doing research, get some Conservative commentaries about the USSR as well as Liberal, then watch this movie. It is a good period piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bravo Milius!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bravo Milius! I vividly remember seeing this movie when I was 10 years old living in Washington, D.C.. As a military brat, I was obsessed by all things military, but also keenly aware of the global political state of the world. Reagan ruled supreme, and a succession of weak Politburo puppets lived and died in the Kremlin. The mid-80's was a scary time for many.It's easy twenty years later to dismiss the premise of Red Dawn as overblown and unrealistic. How things have changed since 1984.Many reviewers have criticized this film for major plot holes and inconsistencies. I offer that these people have not actually viewed and absorbed the story elements portrayed by Red Dawn and John Milius.1. It was clearly stated in the beginning of the film that the Soviet economy was suffering from back to back poor grain harvests. This is what triggered the attack on NATO and then the United States. Hungry people get desperate.2. Nuclear weapons were used on strategic sites to disable key military installations and infrastructure. Many readers do not understand that since the 'invaders' would want to preserve the "Bread Basket" of the country, they wouldn't necessarily use tactical nuclear weapons. Battlefield nukes with small yields are strong enough to decimate with precision. They exist, but have never been used in combat.3. The "Wolverines" were not acting alone. "Radio Free America" showed this. It was demonstrated in the movie that resistance was taking place all over the country. The U.S. has over 73,000,000 men of 'fighting age'. An enemy aims a gun at your home or family, show me one of those 75,000,000 who would not take up arms in defense.4. The enemy used commercial airliners to invade the U.S. It's been done before. A bit of a stretch, but this is presented as fiction.Some cheesy dialogue? Sure. Continuity problems? Maybe. Preachy? Sometimes, but this is a film of good over evil. Believable casting of teenagers. Sometimes wooden, sometimes moving, aren't people that way in real life? Spineless European 20-somethings and the like say that this is just another example of American imperialism. I'd say ask your grandparents if they feel the same way as America sacrificed hundreds of thousands of lives to save your shores, while we were in no immediate danger. TWICE.You spent your childhood living under the veil of security that the United States provided. My generation will repay your debt for the rest our our lives. Donations accepted.That being said, this is a movie review. "Red Dawn" is a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it's World War III and the Soviet Union, paired with the Cubans (who else?) have parachuted into the heartland of America...guess our radar wasn't working that day. So a group of high schoolers high tail it to a store owned by one of the lads' fathers, which conveniently sells guns, ammo, and camping supplies. And inevitably, the teenagers wind up fighting the invaders to the end. Campy acting, cheesy dialogue, and a plot too illogical to ignore ruin much of the movie, but it's harmless as a way to spend two hours. The highlight character is the realistically distraught lead Cuban invader. Overall, "Red Dawn" is a hasty warning to American citizens, disguised as an action flick, at the heyday of the Cold War. The first theatrical release with a PG-13 rating.</fullReview>

"Look what they tried to do to Colorado!" "We sure show'd 'em, eh?" "Mommy, I love the wolverines. I wanna be one. Can I, please?" Imagine, all the wonderful citizens of our country who would believe this movie to be a valuable instruction tool for the youth of today. 'We are the infallible country that has the right, and obligation, to police the entire planet, and UNIVERSE, when the time comes, from all people who don't believe in Free Trade, NAFTA, the second amendment, the Patriot Act, etc..'

		<shortDescription>Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a classic, it is by far the best movie John Milius has ever directed. Im surprised to see the average rating for this picture is only a 6. I will admit that it is old and outdated, but its great for its time period. I love how Milius doesn't try to go ahead of his time period with special effects. A lot of movies in the 80's tried to use computer animation for the first time, but computer animation in the 80's was horrible. In this film they stuck to what they know best, explosions and acting. The movie fits its time period very well. The cold war was going on between America and the Soviet Union, which would make the movie seem like a real possibility during this time. This film has been one of my favorites since the first time I watched it, and I'm not even a Patrick Swayze. I would recommend this film to anyone, bit only if they enjoy good movies no matter how old they may be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Violent, cruel and form of past exorcism. An instinctual Romania of ambiguous transition to democracy, a strange mixture between purity, illusions and instincts, a society of Hieronymus Bosch atmosphere and cupidity, rape and basic desire, exploration of exotic illness and refuge in a empty fight .Story of three young people- victims of a grotesque existence in which money, compromises, lies and masks are elements of perverse normality.Aspects after the end of Comunist nightmare. Fear an quixotic resistance, human-rats , brutal power and man as object in a chaotic economy. The fever of possession in shocking scenes,a world without soul and aspects of social trash. Freedom like exercise of fear, exotic experiment and falling of values.Like many Patrick Swayze films, it is a cry. "Ghost", "Point Break ", "Road House", "Next of Kin" or "The Outsiders", "Black Dog" or "Dirty Dancing" are exploration of insidious social evil, reflections of a barbarian universe in which hopes, illusions or gestures are conventions.At first, this dangerous exercise was part of self-flagellation. Then- description of a profound crisis and deep impurity.In this case, important is the casting .Charlie Sheen, Costel Constantin, Ben Johnson are authors of a strange world and its expression with a superb art to present the American realities like projection of powerful angst.A form of catharsis and testimony of national guilt. A film about a nook of American and its traumas, about the passing of images and feelings, a piece of autism, in fact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They called themselves, THE WOLVERINES.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of things that movies have that happens so often. Invasions. Invasions from outer space or something that landed on Earth. And that is the case in Red Dawn, the action thriller that ask the question , What would happens if the Soviet Union attacks the United States? During the 1980's, the Cold War was still brewing. Movies started coming out that involved the U.S. getting involved with the Soviet Union. Films like WarGames and Rocky IV were taking the premise that the U.S. fighting against the Russians and also, the Cubans. Patrick Swayze plays a resident of the small town. His family members are fighting for their lives. So, a couple of high school students starts to fight back against the Russians. Then, they called themselves, The Wolverines, naming it after their high school sport mascot. Soon enough, the Wolverines takes over the Russian invasion in their small town, showing that they are strong to eliminate them. This is a good action movie, but what I notice is that Red Dawn starts out too early for the invasion scenes. But, that's okay, because Red Dawn is a good natural action flick. &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 3 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting cold war era film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmed during the strained Reagan/Andropov cold war years, Red Dawn depicts the nightmare that was never far from the minds of Americans (the constant reminders given us by our "leaders" probably had something to do with it).Acting is decent, with a pretty good performance turned in by Patrick Swayze as the unofficial leader of a group of teenage guerrillas.This film works because it plays on the fears of the average American. Soviet and Latin American communist forces parachute into a moderately sized town in the US midwest and assault the average people. The attempt seems to be to draw a connection between this and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which must have been similar (considering Afghanistan is mostly rural, there were probably only small towns and villages to attack). At the same time, the message is "Nobody is safe".In reality, these people would have been aware of a Soviet invasion a long time before this happened, because any strategist worth his salt would have sent initial sneak attacks to disrupt military installations first. Why would you initiate a sneak attack on a defenseless town when you could smash military installations first, then simply go into town and take over? The huge military response would have crushed them before they got anywhere, and they simply wouldn't have enough troops to attack both military and civilian targets.In any case, overlooking the nit picking of a history nut will ensure that you get to see a very exciting and well written and acted movie.</fullReview>

Although he's not Al Pacino his character transforms from one man in the beginning to another at the end similar to Michael Corleone in The Godfather.

This can be seen in some excellent action scenes and shows the conflict from both sides.This is no boys-own war film, for it conveys the darker side of war with harrowing executions, self-sacrifice along with the bloody skirmishes and betrayal. The film climaxes with the "wolverines" moving and unforgettable final raid. At the film's close the viewer is left with having seen a war film with a difference...This is vastly underrated film, which is not shown or remembered which is a shame as many of the actors and actress' went on to become famous in the movie industryDefinitely a classic film of the 80s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I viewed this movie a long time ago, and it scared me to death. I thought that it was possible that our country could be attacked. But, as I grew older, I realized that a country would have to be absolutely crazy to attack the US. I found it unbelievable that communists would waste their time on a small town, without obviously going for the military installations. What harm is a small town going to do anyway? However, it was exciting at that, so I gave it an 8. Pretty wild. But, I think that if we were under attack, it would be more than a bunch of teenagers. We would all take up arms and make it impossible for anyone to degrade or defile this country. Therefore, I recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see how paranoia effects the world, and probably causes a lot of crazy stuff to happen today. But, good flick.</fullReview>

But for Hungarians, with many European nations, Soviets were invaders (, after they didn't let the people to make their own decisions).The previous post were full of political arguments. (Even those who rated the movie above average.) I think that most users didn't really categorized this movie well. Partisan movies were made in Yugoslavia, during the cold war, remembering their heroic fight against the Nazis in the WW2. I think somebody watched this in the US and said: "We don't have this! I want!"The story is well written, but some scenes are calculable. Soviets invade the US? Well this could only happen in the writers mind (intellignece), but the way of invasion was realistic. Soviet-American friendship cafeteria, well organized propaganda........ The characters could be your schoolmate, neighbor, so you can emphasize with them. They have feelings (Finally they are not the absolute perfect guys): they have fears, big moments and boys cry even more than girls.The soviet technology was marching all over the place: Zu-23 anti-air tanks, T-72 or T-80's were in one battle, soviet manufactured APC's. And a rare soviet airplanes! (That they blew it up with a hand grenade.) Where the hell did they get them? Overall, I can recommend to all nations youth: I think this is the best sample of patriotism. (Since the Yugoslavian partisans.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Red Dawn isn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red Dawn is not America suddenly invaded without warning and only a group of 80s bratpackers being able to fight off the commies with such disregard for realism that Die Hard looks technically well directed in comparison. It is not the mighty American military stuck in the mud while Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey use their Dirty Dancing magic to save us all. The Cubans and Nicaraguans have developed the manpower to penetrate our borders following Soviet nuclear strikes on America's own warhead silos. Every resource of the US military is engaged in a fierce struggle with hundreds of enemy divisions. Coastal metro areas (The "blue" states for those who must think of this in political terms) are adequately defended, but the vast heartland has become a living hell under Soviet control: the aforementioned nuclear destruction of our own MAD defense apparatus has killed millions, with Stalinist/Maoist style slaughter of civilians as well as famine increasing the death toll even further. Our European "allies," meanwhile, haven't lifted a finger. And they say this movie is fiction!People ill informed enough to compare the Wolverines to Viet Cong or Ansar al Islam in Iraq probably failed to notice that the Wolverines had lived under a free democratic government before being taken over by communists whose disregard for human life has become little more than a cliché in the minds of many. Nor did the Wolverines use violent conscription and taxation methods to further their cause. No toddler's arm was chopped off, no village leader was mutilated for all to see. No one was blown up for being a collaborator, in any context.All through the film, we do see American helicopters, tanks, and planes striking against the Cuban army. But they are spread too thinly to successfully cover all of what has become enemy territory. The Wolverines are but one lone band who have limited abilities and limited goals. They fight for their town, their own piece of ground in the Western plains. Other similar groups exist across the region. Nor is it a leap of the imagination to suggest that football players versed in teamwork, communication, and strategic thought could apply their skills on a battlefield. Teenage boys raised in a rugged forest, taught to hunt, fish, and tolerate the elements might well adapt to guerilla warfare, even with minimal combat instruction. Still, the convenient appearance from nowhere of Powers Boothe to tell them what the hell is going on and convey the 5 minute green beret course adds legitimacy to the view that Red Dawn is as silly as V or any other martians attack flick with commies substituted for space blobs.Red Dawn is worth watching in my view. But it's not for everyone. The latte drinkers, Will and Grace fans, Volvo drivers, Peace Corps volunteers, and New York Times crowd don't seem to care much for this film, and that's their privilege.</fullReview>

Patrick Swayze, as Jed, Charlie Sheen, as Matt, C. Thomas Howell, as Robert, and Jennifer Grey, as Toni, really stand out. It was clearly one of Grey's best roles. They all showed real potential that harkened to their later careers as actors. This is a real war movie that keeps you guessing and routing for the Wolverines.

		<fullReview>Well the Soviets finally managed to invade America with the help of some Cuban commies and now a small group of teenagers start a guerrilla force to fight for their country. Using commercial airlines the Soviets drop in and occupy parts of America in the start of WW III. Brothers Jed Eckert (Patrick Swayze) and Matt (Charlie Sheen) leave their small town with some friends and deiced not to run but to wage a guerrilla war against the Soviet occupation. Calling themselves the "Wolverines" the Soviets soon find that they are dealing with real Americans and cant handle the patriotic force unleashed on them. The reds call in Col. Strelnikov (William Smith) who soon brings them out into the open killing a bunch of them. In the final battle the Brothers lead one final attack against there base Killing the Colonel and die heroes. This movie although it is complete fantasy is still a great war film for the Reagan cold warrior or anyone who grew up with the Rambo movies. Surprisingly acted well for a movie that you would think is just another action film. The kids, though looking a little old for the role, go from being young adults to people who must fight for there right to survive in their own land. Well acted by Sawyze though I still think Sheen needs some work on his acting. With a pretty large cast of future stars, Sheen, Lea Thompson, and Jennifer Grey. William Smith as always is the king of Tough guys, but I feel wasn't used enough in this movie. John Milius of course is the man and directs another great film that will be remembered for an interesting take on the cold war. Fans of Rambo should love this. Same sound effects, costumes, and fake soviet vehicles are used. The movie is not without its flaws. Soviet union was really a joke and could never have invaded North America and the US Would have nuked them of the face of the planet had they launched anything. I'm sure the liberals of course hated this movie, which makes it all the better. You will have to ignore a lot of historical facts when watching, this but, overall for a cool picture I give 10 out of 10. Kill a Commie for God!</fullReview>

Bella ordering a Russian officer to obtain forms 4473 from the gun stores. This is the form everyone who purchases a gun is required to fill out and sign. This later leads to all of the "trouble makers" i.e. gun owners, being rounded up and sent to the "re-education camp". Should a foreign army actually invade the USA this no doubt would take place everywhere behind the lines.Even though this is a work of fiction, there is a very important message about the second amendment here.

		<fullReview>Wow, I was browsing through my collection and came across this one. My first thought was how do I relate this film to the present. After all, the Soviet Union and the Cuban Communist threats have faded into history. I guess this is why they are remaking this film using North Korea as the aggressor instead of the Soviet Union. Well, no matter, since the plot of the film is still viable, war from the perspective of the civilians who are trapped behind enemy lines. Patrick Swayze leads a very competent cast in portraying Jedidiah Eckert, a young man in his 20's who must bear the burden of survival for five boys who are with him from the high school. Charlie Sheen does well as his brother (this is long before he decided that life would be better with a drug induced perspective), and C. Thomas Howell is dynamic as the boy who becomes a man. Jennifer Grey and Leah Thompson add a dimension of women in combat, and both do well in the roles, although Thompson fails to convey the angst of a girl who has been molested by the invading soldiers. Powers Boothe gives us a look at a fighter pilot hoping for the best and believing the worst. His plane has been shot down, he doesn't know if his family is still alive, and still he fights to the best of his ability "How did you get yourself shot down?" "It was five to one, I got four!" Harry Dean Stanton gives a brief but powerful performance as Mr. Eckert, Jed and Mattie's father. The photography and scenery are magnificent, and the attention to detail is exceptional. While the violence is enough to keep the preteen set away from the screen, the language is good and there are no scenes of nudity or drug use.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far one of the best all time war movies of all time. It's low budget and gritty. It doesn't glamorize war. It makes war out to be what war is, it's a dirty rotten business with no winners. In war there is no winners or losers, it's just survival. It's kill or be killed, it's live or die. I was impressed with the movie. I was impressed by it's realism.I think any solider would watch this and feel it to be an accurate depiction of what guerrilla warfare is all about. I didn't feel there were any big gaps of logic or leaps of faith. The characters in most regards behaved and reacted as I would if I were in their situation. Killing another human being is never easy, until you watch the enemy kill your family or friends. Then it becomes really easy and it gets easier and easier the more you do it. To the place and point you don't even feel anything anymore. A wounded enemy is begging for his life and you walk up and shoot him in the head without hesitation. That's the difference between a real warrior and you and I sitting at home.Real warriors turn off their emotions and become killing machines. These kids in the movie became killing machines. They retained some of their humanity but over all they became warriors and fought courageously to the death. They became better than their enemy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best future history movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just read in Wikipedia that it's been remade. It's true. The remake's coming out on November 24th. The remake's been updated. Back to this movie. Red Dawn, (the 1984 original), is about a Soviet-led invasion of the United States. Eight high school students from Calumet, Colorado, become insurgents calling themselves "Wolverines." (The nickname of their high school's sports teams). Arming themselves with hunting rifles, and bows and arrows, they begin a guerrilla war against the Soviets, Cubans, and Nicaraguans. Some said that it was a teen fantasy. Others said that it was a madman's delusional fantasy. Screw that. I say that's the best future history movie ever made. Granted, this is a late Cold War movie, but consider it a cautionary tale----we take our freedom for granted----- and we lose it. Like the ABC miniseries Amerika, which aired three years later, Red Dawn is about the occupation of the United States. This is the beginning of World War III. Amerika was set right after the end of World War III. Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson, and Powers Booth were in the original. As for what others say about this movie, and the remake, both are to be considered alternate history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite its goofy, paranoid plot, it's a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Infamous piece of right-wing paranoia, involving a group of teens fighting a guerrilla war against invading Russians, Cubans and Nicaraguans. It's a joke of a film, one of those you'd only watch if you want to see a movie that's so bad it's good, right? Well, no, actually. If you can look past the ridiculousness of the setup, it's a good movie. A darn good movie, really. Milius, most famous for being the screenwriter for Apocalypse Now and the director of Conan the Barbarian, may not be the best director who ever lived, but he is a good one. If the film were nothing but reactionary propaganda, it wouldn't be remembered quite as well today. Shows like South Park and Family Guy couldn't do take-offs on particular scenes if it had been a forgettable movie. The story is quite gripping, and the characters are fairly well written and performed by an excellent young cast (among them Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, Jennifer Grey, Lea Thompson, and C. Thomas Howell). I do think there might have been a bit more of a relationship between the kids. Some of the film's strongest sequences have to do with the moral questions they ask themselves, and the fights they have with each other. If we knew a bit more about the characters, it might be stronger there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great piece of 80s perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red Dawn is an interesting movie set after the fall of NATO and American dominance in the 20th century. Its the story of one small town's fight for freedom against a surprise Soviet invasion of the United States.Quite a few reviewers have come back to this movie in the 21st century and scoff at it as piece of B movie tripe. Its really a picture of Regan's America at the height of the third, and final generations vision of the cold war. Post Cuba, Post Vietnam, but pre-glasnost, the wall coming down and modern Europe. Its easy to forget how real the idea of war with the Soviet Union was, or the context for how the surprise attack happens as being bases in fact (The Soviet Union carried out a surprise invasion of Afghanistan by using commercial airliners), and the general mind set of the time is shown by looking at other moves of the period, such as the "Day After", "Road Warrior" and other post nuclear war movies. Recall those years when Reagan referred to the Soviet Union as the Evil Empire, and even the Pope denounced Communism as an evil upon man and you the back drop for Red Dawn.Enter our favorite young actors of the time, throw in a dash of the time period, and a marginally plausible plot and you have Red Dawn. its just a good movie to take you back to those paranoid years of the early 80's, before America's military dominance was a given, when the scars of Vietnam were still fresh upon the political zeitgeist.Yes its dramatic, yes it could never happen, but at the time, it seemed real enough to make this movie into a ongoing classic. So pick up your rifle, head for the hills and help defend the rockies from communist aggression! Red Dawn, its a good movie for the whole family.</fullReview>

On any level, it is an honest action/war movie that is not without atouch of ironic humor (only once or twice - it is usually anunrelenting downer). It also has some good talent (Ben Johnson, Patrick Swayze, etc.).One thing: my wife has pointed out that the male guerillas alwayslook clean and squared away while the two female guerillasusually look quite scroungy. I didn't notice it at first, but, she wasright.

They had no training or experience in warfare, but they banded together for a common cause. For some reason, Howell's role as Robert is one of my all-time favorites, and when he goes up against a helicopter with a machine gun, I get excited no matter how many times I've seen the movie.

		<shortDescription>JFM warned us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Milius made this whole movie as a warning. I was active duty, northern MI, SAC bomber yard, those who were there will know when and where. This was the real deal. The premise of "civilian airliners" being used as weapons of war, if we where made to think there was no threat, no problem. Milius is a thorn in Hollywood. He is one of the few brave enough to come out and tell the truth and sound the alarm. One scene tells it all for those who pay attention. The soviet general commands the Cuban officer: "Go to the gun stores, get the form 4473, that will tell us where the guns are". How clearer can you be. John was warning us of what could happen if certain information was made to be kept at the ease access of invading armies or political enemies to freedom. A fascistic force first takes down the hard targets, the "peasants" that can fight back. It is true today, senior officials of the former "evil empire" were known to have said that they feared invading the states. Too many of us were in a position to fight back, they did not have the forces to take all of us out at once. It has been twenty five years, Swayze is dead, he is lionized as the dirty dancer stud, before that he was the leader of the resistance. Sad that in today's society your ability to float around a stage is more important that your ability to take point to defend the one place where those who wish to smear us are freely allowed to do so without penalty of death. Like it was back in the bad old days in the "Sov Block". Who is our new "Hero"? Some long haired ball capped bozo who screams about the evils of the American everyman, the capitalistic system that has made us what we are and our ability to show care and compassion to all in times of need even if it bankrupts us. Even if they broke the law to be here, they are humans first and receive the same treatment. Not that I would want anything to happen to the bozo from MI who hates us, but if he had suffered a serious incident while down in the workers paradise of "Benevolent Brother Fidel", how fast would he have been on a flight directly to the best university trauma ward in Miami? I will give Swayze a big thumbs up, stayed with one woman for a long time, was not known for catting about. Funny how Hollywood/mainstream media giants never put that at the top of the story. On the whole Pat was a regular guy, played some real down to earth dudes. Can't really remember him spouting off on issues he knew nothing about. He had a talent and did well at it and stuck to it. We will miss him. Ain't many on the left coast like that anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the most patriotic anti-war film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be the most patriotic anti-war film ever made, and it has never been more timely than in 2003. When a coalition of a super power and its client nations bomb and invade the US to "liberate" it from its "capitalist oppressors," a group of high school football players, with the knowledge and values learned from a culture of guns and hunting, chooses to fight for home and family against hopeless odds rather than flee to safe territory 40 miles away. This movie glorifies their heroism but also laments the horrifying price in soul-deadening violence they pay for revenge.The balanced wisdom of this movie is represented by the Nicaraguan commander who comes to realize that, as an occupying invader, he is on the wrong side of the war, even though he is fighting for the same ideals he had as an insurgent in his own country against his own government. This is a movie that celebrates traditional American values of family, freedom and individualism while showing the horrors of warfare, whether used wrongly to promote ideology (in this case communist rather than democratic ideology) or rightly to defend one's home.I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when I read that some Americans who think they are fighting for freedom and their country used Red Dawn and Wolverine as code names for actions that are chillingly reminiscent of things done by the occupying forces in this movie. It is amazing that a movie so misunderstood by both the political left and the political right could have such an impact, especially since its value as entertainment is so dependent on the philosophical perspective of the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent 80's action/war film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I would like to comment on some of the truly negative comments this films has gotten, especially from Igor-36. This movie was made in 1984 people! It was a sign of the times. The cold war was still going stong. At least this movie took a different approach to the problem and showed conventional warfare and wasn't just another nuke movie. Do these same people watch movies based on WWII and think that America/Britain etc. still hate the Germans and Japanese?One of the big criticisms this movie receives is that a bunch of high school kids couldn't hide out in the mountains and stay hidden from an enemy army. Well, the film does a good job at showing that some of the kids have hunting/survival training and might I point out that as of Oct. 3, 2002 the big bad U.S. Army still hasn't found Bin Ladden! So it is plausible. Plus, it's not like the enemy army didn't have other fronts to defend.Is this movie propaganda? Sure, low level propaganda that is, but it's a fun movie that's not supposed to be taken too seriously. I loved this movie when I first saw it back in 1984 and still love it today. It's got tons of action and a good cast. I think a few people out there need to lighten up and realize that a few years have past since this movie was released. Red Dawn gets an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>shallow critics eagerly overlook some unique elements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie tends to get a lot of bad comments. Many critics like to brand it as too patriotic, unbelievable and silly. I think they are overlooking the main premise of the movie. First of all, it is an interesting idea. Many good 'what if' movies were made during the cold war. This one was different from most in that it did not show its 'what if' scenario from the perspective of world leaders or the military participants. It showed from the perspective of a bunch of scared kids. One fact often overlooked in the harsh criticism of this movie that it actually had some very believable elements. One of the more surprising elements is that these high school kids did not react to the invasion by running out and taking on the whole Soviet Army. They actually grabbed as many supplies as they could as fast as they could and ran to the mountains to hide. They did not engage any of the Warsaw Pact military until they were discovered by some Russian Army sight see-Er's. And had to kill them to defend themselves. This first sequence of scenes shows a very disorganized and amateur effort which was very believable. The after effect was the realization that they had now put themselves in a position where they had to fight. Whether that would be true or not, it is conclusion they came to in their discussion later that night. And again, I find it very believable that a group of teen agers in that position would come to that conclusion.So, as time progresses and the movie goes on; these teen-agers get better at staging ambushes and creating havoc for the Soviet army and its allies. Of course it is a Hollywood movie and its going to be unrealistic in the way it portrays battles. But another point that critics of this movie overlook is that this kind of thing has actually happened in history. The French resistance, the Vietnam war, and the recent insurgents in Iraq. In some of these cases the people who rose up to fight the foreign forces may have had experience in warfare, but in many cases such as the French resistance that was not so. And I would have to believe that an American resistance would be at least as effective as the French were.Another gripe is that this movie is too patriotic. My answer to that is that it was the cold war and the movie is about one nation being invaded by its arch enemy with completely different ideologies. I cannot imagine making a movie like this and leaving the patriotic aspect out. That would be like making a movie about Pearl Harbor and trying to leave out the patriotism and the elements showing how Americans felt about the Japanese aggressors just following that attack.All that being said, of course a group of high school kids would not have been able to have had this kind of success against the Soviet army. But one thing usually overlooked about this movie is that in the end, all but a few of the good guys die. There are real life scenarios these kids had to deal with including confronting one of their own who became a traitor. There was a very dramatic scene which showed Swayze having to deal with that situation and he found that he could not do what he knew he had to do. There are some dark moments in this movie and it is not a happy go lucky shoot-em-up kill all the commies like ducks in a barrel kind of a movie as it is sometimes portrayed to be. Its worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Red Dawn was written during the Soviet invasion and occupation of Afghanistan. It asks what it would be like to have Soviet, Cuban and Nicaraguan troops invading the Southwestern United States. How would it feel for Americans to be attacked as the Afghans were?The story weaves elements of past wars and a possible future (circa 1984) limited war. Cuban expansion into Nicaragua, Soviet Hind-D attack helicopters strafing horseback Afghan rebels, Communist revolution in Mexico, America's counterinsurgency (counter-revolutionary) war in Vietnam form the main themes of this war. The film proposes that as technology inevitably breaks down due to the grind of battle, war degrades into combat on an individual or squad level. Red Dawn hints at the horrifying cost of war to the general civilian population due to nukes, siege and starvation. It shows the monsterous measures totalitarian conquerers use to suppress captured civilians. The latter is hardly fantasy. It happened repeatedly in the 20th century and goes on today in places like Burma, Serbia, Rwanda, etc.Director John Milius indirectly criticizes U.S. conduct in Vietnam through Cuban Commander Bella's awakening conscience. Bella was himself a guerilla fighting just revolutions against corrupt governments. In this war he finds himself literally in the other camp, brutally crushing the grassroots resistance and often non-resistance of the local people. At first he laments becoming a mere policeman. He eventually realizes he has become something he despises: an oppressor of the common people.The heroes of the film, a cast of young stars who will go on to lead countless movies, show the American spirit that created our country and helped saved the world from fascist and communist domination at least twice this century. They barely have the tools they need to survive but adapt and bring the war back to the enemy.If you believe bigger government is the answer to all problems and would not fight to defend your country or your freedom, you probably won't like this film. If you can put aside your biases and consider for a moment what it would be like to have your country invaded by a modern, well-equipped, and ruthless army, you may find yourself enjoying this film as much as I do.</fullReview>

I mean, they went into hysterics over it. A similar reaction had taken place, only much more intense with a TV movie titled Amerika (which suffered from a lack of serious editing). By this time, the censorship in the US had diminished in power and such movies could be made, but they suffered mischaracterization and vicious attacks (e.g., Rambo III).I can't speak for others, but one problem that I had with the movie was that I had trouble physically differentiating the different characters. I wish that the group of wolverines would have had some blondes, redheads, blacks, orientals, and they had dressed a bit differently. But that is just me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Propaganda movie to help Ameican rearmament from the eighties.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie before, several years back and promptly forgot about it.America had lost the Vietnam war (1975), and movies like this were designed to justify rearmament, renewed national chauvinism and pride in the American nation. There were a whole string of movies along this aggressive genre......Rambo's etc.....This was along with the political backdrop of the Reagan era, and a more aggressive foreign policy. The Soviet Union collapsed, mainly because of the unworkability of Communism and the huge problems the country faced trying to make a system work the impossible.The movie has a 1950's UFO Martians(Russians)are coming tackiness about it, and is wholly unbelievable.There would be a nuclear exchange before it were allowed to get to this juncture, and America in the 1980's could mobilize 8 million men and women, so no power could just parachute into the USA..........for god sake! No connection with reality.However there is a bit of irony. The irony is that America in many ways has become a totalitarian society, where regular troops parade through the country during emergencies, and now more regularly in some parts. Concentration camps have been built by the American government to hold millions of dissenting Americans. The level of surveillance, and so forth created after false flag ops by the Israelis and their American puppets.America now goes forth abroad to "liberate" people in foreign countries, using lies deception, torture, rape, resource theft, and so forth.So why use teenagers to resist in the movie? I assume it is a RECRUITMENT ad for future generations of military personnel into the late eighties and 1990's........in this, the absurd scenario and cardboard actors in the "MOVIE" play a an excellent role for the Pentagon.The Soviet Union was a brutal empire, and one only has to remember their performance in Afghanistan where 1.5 million Afghans perished under them to remember this (1980-1989). The demise of the USSR was good for America, the world and for the people of the Soviet Union. But in the process of fighting evil one has to avoid becoming evil, and this movie provides no thought on this matter, or any reflection..........The cardboard acting, and silly premise provides no depth, just conflict and basic flag waving. There is also a bit of good old fashioned racism thrown in with the swarthy Cubans being ever present, doing some of the nastiest bit of pantomime evil for the little ignorant kiddies.Yes they are flooding in from the South, and will take over the country in a few years.The dialogue...basic, basic.The action/military encounter sequences were also unrealistic......in real guerrilla warfare it doesn't happen like this..........See the beautifully made "Come and See" movie 1986 Soviet Union.However the movies premise is not totally irrelevant in the present American context, where the country is being led by its ruling elite. It is against this "REALITY" that the American people must prepare.The movie provides a Freudian wake up call, but obviously not against the present Russians.</fullReview>

Made at a time when liberals were in utter hysteria that Reagan was about to plunge the planet into nuclear devastation and inconvenience thousands of high paid liberal millionaire producers, directors and stars. Produced around the same time as 'Testament', 'The Day After' and 'Threads'-movies that were the left's ('Threads' was British)spineless attempts to warn the great unwashed that Reagan was a war-mongering madman and we, the artsy-fartsy set are going to do something about it-so, we'll make a movie and teach that awful Reagan not to inconvenience us by trying to win the cold war. Red Dawn itself is a fair movie about people's reaction to an actual invasion of the US. The Russians and Cubans come off as the perfect evil protagonists and the kids fighting them, well come on-they're the good guys. Too bad the producers didn't change the invasion's locale to Beverly Hills or Hollywood so the patriot's could also kick the ass of the producers of Testament and The Day After and the rest of the moribund left, many of whom at that time had nothing but warm and fuzzy feelings for their ideological co-stars in Havana, Moscow and Managua.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to clear up a few injustices that a past comment has given this film. First of all, the Russians team up with the Mexicans against the U.S., and that is how they come into America...through Mexico. Also, this movie does not treat women like dirt, because I was leaning in that direction myself at the start, but I was pleased at how the women were given a makeover to be equal to their male colleagues. Plus, this movie isn't for war-lovers, and anyone to think that has a very naive view of the plot. This movie is for patriots and for people who believe in the human right to defend themselves and their homeland. It is not displaying that the characters loved war...they thought nothing good of it, but they weren't afraid of the Russians when it came to the core of it. These teenagers were able to use their intelligent strategies, training, and just the simple faith of reacquiring their lives from those who stole them to push the enemy out giving others hope in the process. "Red Dawn" is not sexist, war-loving, or whatever other ridiculous name you can label it. What this movie stands for is what ALL Americans should stand for if we were ever to be invaded and have our regular lives taken away...defending ourselves to the end, at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excuse me, but that was not Soviet forces invading, but South American Communist forces invading in league with Soviet forces.Additional forces did come from Soviet supported lands.The invading forces only had to come from Mexico, Cuba, Latin America, and South America.Invading high schools would strike fear and terror in the enemy.This is in response to previous comments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Land of the Free and Home of the Brave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best pro-liberty movie ever out of Hollywood.Cold War Reds represent government tyranny as the brave town youths depict our internal yearning for individual liberty. Gun ownership equals freedom. Gun registration is a certain ticket to a very deadly stay in a less than pleasant concentration camp. Left wingers are uncomfortable with this movie's pro gun messages and many peg RED DAWN as a movie for conservatives. However, a careful viewing will uncover references to American intrusions in foreign lands -- brutal ends-justify-the-means aggressions against other nations because might is right... criticisms certainly not embraced by the conservative right in America.Not left, not right. RED DAWN celebrates do-it-yourself libertarian ideals and does it well.The direction is top notch and the highly skilled cast delivers. This is an excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a little slice of history....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is excellent. The weapons were realistic (except for the Hinds having the wrong number of rotary wings and the slowness of the RPGs, but hey, still it was pretty darn good) While some think the plot was not terribly realistic, remember the time it was made. This movie addressed many of the fears of Americans during the height of the Cold War, and provided both a patriotic message (America does not suck) and a humanitarian one (war sucks). Some say this movie was propaganda. I disagree. It portrayed both sides as being human: There were both good (the boy outside the friendship center) and bad (the would be rapist/thief tank crew) russians, a good cuban, and good and bad (Robert, when he got too eager to kill, and Darryl's dad, for selling out his own son) americans. This is not a film which demonizes one side, it portrays both sides as being made up of people, regardless of what their leaders do. Also of interest was the reference to the 4473s...the infamous "yellow sheet" and the bad uses of gun registration. I bought this film in the mid-80's, and watch it every so often, still. I'd put it in the top 5 films of the 1980's, and give it a "10"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Understanding the Misunderstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a response to the curious comments made by Gungrave.--GG: Misunderstood? What's to misunderstand?-ME: Interesting that you ask that question. Allow me to answer it...--GG: Well, I cant honestly say this movie evoked any sort of political argument or emotive response from myself-ME: That's because you weren't there, and as you read further you'll begin to understand the implication of this. In short, this lack of personal experience of the time period sadly makes it impossible for anyone to experience the film like those of us who saw the film in 1984. As you age and mature, you will comprehend further the intricacies involved with films such as this as they relate to the time period during which they were released.--GG: The film was an entertaining, nostalgic and highly commercial action movie from a time past.-ME: That was far from the intent in 1984.--GG: Handled clumsily and probably with an extremely limited budget it took a good 20 minutes for the B-movie ethic to settle in-ME: It took that long because it was never a B-movie, nor was it ever intended to become such. In fact, there was nothing low-budget about it when it was made.--GG: The story became a bit strung out in places, the action was cardboardy and basic -ME: You are comparing it against today's scripting and sfx technology. Also, it was 20 years old when you saw it and the film or tape had degraded significantly. The film, when new, had a greater realism. Thankfully, films now are digitalized immediately or even filmed digitally; this means much less degradation, if any, for future generations.--GG: Where peoples readings of political messages come from I have no idea.-ME: They would have been unmistakable had you been an American teenager in 1984, when Ronald Reagan was at the height of his presidency, and the Cold War was at its coldest.--GG: The joke in the film of the NRA bumper sticker and the dead guys "cold, dead hand" falls flat if it was intended as a purposeful message and therefore seems more to be an attempt at acknowledging the certain irony of such events in the states.-ME: The bumper sticker, whether it was intended for humor or not, isn't as much a joke as it is a warning as well as a statement of determination. Most Americans understand the 2nd Amendment is there to keep us safe from foreign and domestic invaders.--GG: The rhetoric of the kids in their internal arguments is hollow and situational, not political, and just about manage to hold some water.-ME: Again, you weren't there. ;c) Every generation has these; the only difference is the subject matter.--GG: The movie is and was just a great "what if.....?" and an amusing 80's Hollywood shtick action movie, no more, no less.-ME: It was never an "80's amusing shtick action movie" in any way, shape or form. It was an intensely serious drama - a dialog with teenagers of the time, expressing what a lot of us were feeling and thinking at the time. While every film endeavors to have a funny moment or two, there was never any intent humor beyond that. Had you been a teenager at the time, you would have found the film to be rather profound any many ways and haunting for a very long time.--GG: If a backstory of a continued Cold War was introduced I can well see this being ripe for a remake, and perhaps then you can apply your knee-jerk reactionary theories to it with more basis then...who know?-ME: Funny you should mention that... http://www.imdb.com/news/ni0183471/ It boils down to you were not privy to the reality people carried into the theaters back then. The Cold War was as pervasive in everyday life then as terrorism pervaded daily life in the years following Sept. 11, 2001. This movie played very well into those fears and political views of 1984, especially of those under 18.By the way, the reason most didn't like the movie as much as they otherwise would have back then was because many people would have preferred an alternate ending. Regardless, it was still a very influential film for teenagers back then.I hope one day you can experience this film and others similar to it in a more kindred aspect.Cheers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Red Dawn is a patriotic film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I see TV Guide's rating for Red Dawn which has always been 1 star, I take offense. However, I understand that it was no doubt rated by a NY liberal who has no love for anything off road, which Red Dawn certainly was.1984 was a tough time for patriots and Red Dawn did much to give us something to watch. Outdoorsy, hunting, gun toting types like myself understood the film. If we were outdoorsy hunting types who were also fans of WWII history then so much the better! As a little rebel kid in the late 60's I used to daydream what it would be like to have to take to the woods with my little rebel pals if we were invaded, not that I wanted it to happen, of course. If you didn't live in those times, then, even with 911, you can have no concept of how real we thought the possibility might be with the Russians, Cubans, and all the bad guys in South America, etc. Anyway, Red Dawn is personal for me because I was stunned. It was like they had lifted my daydreams right out of my head and put them on the screen. You see, we have mountains where I live too and they always figured in my concept of local survival. Add all the patriotic and historical touches and it made a masterpiece. Of course, the TV Guide rates it only one star. It's a shame that they didn't mention that Red Dawn was one of the real early films to run on HBO and they ran it for MONTHS. Everybody, with the exception of the NY critics, were crazy about that movie. You won't find that little fact mentioned in the reviews! It was a runaway hit. It's amazing what that little one star deal can mean down thru the ages as new audiences come along and seeing that low rating don't even bother to see what all the fuss was about! Norm</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has many young actors and actresses in it. There are 10 big Hollywood names in the cast. It all starts out when America gets attacked by South Americans, that are fighting on the side of the Russians. Some Americans go quietly and live in concentration camps, but some of the local high school kids become rebels. They form a group that lives in the mountains and only come down to hunt for "bad guys"... This movie is a MUST SEE, it stands the test of time far more then any other movie on the subject!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. I remember seeing it in the theater and feeling myself drawn into the powerful drama on screen.Very believable and highly accurate for its' time, Red Dawn raised awareness that given the proper circumstances, the U.S. could find itself at the mercy of the Soviets and their allies. Anyone who sees this film for the first time now needs to keep in mind the events of the early 1980's in order to put the film in proper perspective.An all-star cast and some great acting really enhanced the strength of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent movie which is quite politically incorrect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is an intrinsic quality about a movie with tells us whether it is good or bad. That quality is whether the characters "work" for us. If they do not work nothing will make the movie believable. This movie worked for me because its characters worked for me.It deals with an impossible situation, an invasion of the United States by Soviet backed forces and the inevitable resistance by Americans. The movie is totally politically incorrect. In setting up the scenario the producers studied the USSR and its manner of operation and came up with the only plausible Soviet invasion of the US. It is roughly based on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan which occurred in 1979.The characters themselves are realistic, and the movie treats the invaders are real human being. They are not the evil creatures of the WWII propaganda films or the more modern Rambo films. This is one movie which deserves to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seriously overlooked and wrongfully criticized</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a truely horrifying film. It displays what could VERY easily happen. True the Russian and Cuban forces would not be the invaders. Now we have all new sets of bad guys(Sadam anyone?). Look at their countries... Bay Root was once the Las Vegas of the middle East and it is garbage now. It can happen! Not to mention the fact that the film is well acted. Swayze turns in one of his best performances. Powers Booth was excellent as well. I do find it unlikely however that this group which the film revolves around would have survived as long as they did. But this film does show off the American... the human spirit to protect freedom at all costs. I would never go off and fight in some war ten thousand miles away but I would die for the sake of this country(America ain't much but it is pretty sweet compared to some parts of the world).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My #2 All-time Favorite Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Liberals, stay away, and please, no film reviews. It amazes me that this film is a staple of Ted Turner's TNT cable outlet. I wonder if he ever watched it? I am a sucker for a unique concept as long as the film holds my interest from start to finish. Red Dawn is about the U.S. under siege from Russians and Cubans. The movie is set away from the main battle lines and the young students are engaging in guerilla warfare. Then as now, the idea is pretty much beyond belief. So what, this movie rocks. And remember, the operative word is U.S. under siege. This remains a real possibly given such weapons of mass destruction, including anthrax and van size nuclear devices. The key to enjoying this film is to disengage your political beliefs and appreciate film making at its finest. Loads of action, escapism and patriotism. Note: My favorite film is Groundhog Day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspirational Story of American Triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a must see I say. It shows the horrors of war and occupations. But what I liked most about this movie was when the teens started striking back against the Russians. The action was great, and there were teen deaths, showing that they aren't immortal warriors. It was quite patriotic and sad. It was a little sexist, but that was because it was sexist in the 80's, remember? It wasn't too violent. The most violence was when you could see the holes in there bodies when they were shot. I couldn't stop watching, and at time, the suspense was killing me. You could never really see where the movie was going, and watching the teens turn into killings machines. Every action scene was good, and I would highly recommend this movie to action fans and just average movie watchers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Insurgency Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somebody did their homework when putting this film together. Red Dawn is essentially a visual handbook on the conduct of guerilla operations against an enemy who has otherwise overwhelming superiority in main battle tanks, troops, logistics, etc. Taking lessons learned in combat in such places as the Russian-Finnish Winter War of 1940, Vietnam and the countless low intensity conflicts in between, the directors bring these lessons home to America. It's also a commentary on honor, duty, love for one's family and county, as well as indominitable will. Commies and Lefties will hate this film because it reflects the truth of Soviet methods of invasion and occupation (recall the initial invaders are Cuban troops, such as the 50,000+ proxy troops sent to Angola during the 1970- 1980's). It shows their brutality and use of local records to round up weapons from 'registered' gun owners. It shows their use of the love of one's family members as a weapon, by taking part of the town hostage and eventually executing them. But mostly, the Soviets hated it because it showed how they can be fought and defeated, such as in Afghanistan and Angola. In Marines v. Special Forces wargames, we often shouted "Wolverines!" when attacking at night. Overall, 9 out of ten points, with another added for getting this film made in Leftist-controlled Hollywood. This film kicked butt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Russians and the Chinese could still invade America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red Dawn is a cold war movie that made people think in its day that America could be invaded. Today Russia and China are still very capable of invading AMERICA together. As a CIA informant I have heard rumors about an alliance between Russia and China. If they invade with airborne forces I don't think AMERICA could stop them with over 100 thousand troops out of the country without using NUCLEAR WEAPONS. Red Dawn Director John Milius is outstanding in his use of tight camera angles. Lea Thompson as Erica is a Cinematic rarity because she is a Woman American resistance fighter. C. Thomas Howell is believable in the role of Robert Morris. Charlie Sheen and Patrick Swayze get the tearful scene as the Eckert brothers all shot up inside a boxcar and discovered by their nemesis Col. Strelnikov. Powers Boothe as Col. Andy Taylor provides the Military knowhow to the Wolverines. It figures that the anti-military types in America would give RED DAWN a low rating. In case I don't survive the coming Chinese and Russian attack I would just like to say that OLD SPOOKS DONT FADE AWAY THEY JUST SIGH AN AURA. I gave Red Dawn a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>
