		<fullReview>Exceptional crime/suspense yarn has Milland as a crime reporter who's accidentally made himself the fall guy for a murder committed by his editor! Laughton plays the manipulative newsman with all his smarmy prowess. The direction is good, pacing tight, photography excellent. The supporting cast is also excellent and well directed -- particularly memorable are Elsa Lanchester as a small-time artist whose paintings provide witness to the murderer, and Harry Morgan as (believe it or not) the big boss' muscle. Macready also pitches in as Laughton's right hand man who nonetheless refuses to take the fall for the boss himself. Very nice continuity of theme of time, great atmosphere. One of the best of its kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Film Noir With Fine Cast, Complicated Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Big Clock" takes some chances with unusual characters, and with complicated and sometimes outlandish plot developments, but it holds together well to produce a generally satisfying, and always interesting, suspense film. A fine cast makes us both believe in and identify with the characters, and good direction by John Farrow keeps the film moving, and blends together what otherwise could have been a lot of incongruous plot devices.Ray Milland is a vital part of the film's success in his role as George Stroud, the editor of a crime magazine who has an amazing talent for tracking down elusive criminals. Already caught in a conflict between his neglected wife and his domineering employer, Stroud finds himself asked to direct a search for an unknown murderer in a case where, because of a chain of circumstantial evidence, all the clues point back to himself. What the audience knows, but Stroud does not, is that the real killer is his boss, played with panache by Charles Laughton, who is obsessed with time and whose proudest creation is a gigantic clock that dominates the publishing house that he runs. The title refers literally to this clock, and perhaps metaphorically refers to the urgency faced by Milland's character as he fights against time trying to extricate himself from his troubles. Milland nicely underplays all of this, and communicates his dilemmas with a lot of credibility.The supporting cast is an important part of the film, as they must bring life and credibility to a series of oddball plot elements, and they are all quite good. Especially noteworthy is Elsa Lanchester's performance as an eccentric artist whose paintings become one of the clues to the crime. Lanchester is simply wonderful in her scenes, and the movie would be worth watching over again for those alone."The Big Clock" is a good example of a "film noir", and will be most enjoyed by those who are fans of the way films of the genre were made in their heyday. But it would also be a good choice for anyone who likes crime/mystery stories and who is willing to look at the way such films were made in an earlier era. After watching "The Big Clock", you might want to see more of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When reviewing films like The Big Clock the usual temptation for reviewers is to say it's all right, but Alfred Hitchcock could have done it better. I'm prone to that comment myself. But I can't see how Hitchcock could have done it better in this case. The plot is complicated, but not so that you get bogged down. It defies encapsulation, but briefly Charles Laughton, a Rupert Murdoch like publisher back in the day kills his mistress Rita Johnson. Earlier that day Johnson had picked up Ray Milland who is the editor of one of Laughton's publications Crimeways magazine and had a night on the town with him. Laughton sees someone leaving Johnson's apartment, it's Milland, but Laughton only glimpses and can't identify him before killing Johnson. With the help of his right hand man George MacReady, Laughton tries to find the stranger to pin the murder on him and enlists Milland to do it. Milland realizes what the game is and it's quite a duel of wits between two very intelligent people.Milland, though directed by John Farrow here, is a typical Hitchcock hero trapped by circumstances and desperately looking for a solution. It's possible that Hitchcock saw this film and had Milland in mind for one his films and he did eventually use him in Dial M for Murder. Laughton covers some familiar ground here. He's a powerful man with a fetish for punctuality. The title of the film refers to The Big Clock in the lobby of his skyscraper in New York. It runs on naval observatory time and is also running in tandem with all the clocks in all the buildings that Janoth publications has in the country. In fact it's Johnson's lateness that sets him off in their confrontation. And Milland throws him off his game by stopping The Big Clock in the lobby.The closest role that Laughton played to Earl Janoth here has to be Inspector Javert in Les Miserables. Both are complete anal retentives, with Javert it's the law, with Janoth its time. Javert has no personal life, Janoth apparently can't handle one. And with both only an actor of great talent and skill like Charles Laughton can make you be repelled by his actions and still feel some sympathy for him. The Big Clock holds up very well today and I wish it would be remade and could be. It was with Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman in No Way Out with the setting now the Pentagon. I'd like to see it updated and keep it in a civilian setting. Though I doubt it would be as good as the Laughton/Milland version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare case where the hunter is also the hunted...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most filmgoers are probably more familiar with this film's 1987 updating, "No Way Out", starring Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman. That said, "The Big Clock", as with most originals which later spawn remakes of one form or another, is the better film to my mind. It features Ray Milland as a workaholic crime magazine editor for a ruthless publisher (Charles Laughton). Milland has developed his own special method of catching criminals, consisting of glomming onto details that the police disregard as irrelevant. How little does he suspect that, within 24 hours, that same method is going to be used against him...He stays the night at his boss' mistress to sleep off a hangover. When Laughton strolls in for a suprise visit, Milland manages to get away before being IDed, but not before Laughton sees his shadowy figure on the stairs. In a jealous rage, Laughton kills his mistress and later sets about framing the figure he saw...who, unknown to him, is actually the man he's putting in charge of the investigation, Milland! What follows from this setup is one of the most elaborate cat-and-mouse games I have ever seen on celluloid, the key difference here being that the cat has no idea who the mouse is.The leads are what make this film stand out. Milland was always very good at playing "the man caught in the middle" and this time is no exception. Kirk Douglas once noted in his autobiography, "The Ragman's Son", that whenever Laughton speaks his lines, it's as though the words just suddenly occurred to him rather than reciting something from memory. It's definitely put to good use here; Laughton oozes menace and coldness with no discernable effort. Other notables in the cast include Elsa Lancaster ("Bride of Frankenstein" and Laughton's real-life wife) as an eccentric artist who helps Milland and a then-unknown Harry Morgan as a silent, suspicious bodyguard to Laughton's publisher.While perhaps not extraordinary in and of itself, "The Big Clock" is still a good film worth watching, buying, and owning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Problem of Publishers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason (despite a tendency to join forces to protect the first amendment's freedom of speech), movies tend to make publishers look venal and awful. Even that most sympathetic of publishers, Charles Foster Kane, is a megalomaniac (albeit one robbed of a happy childhood). Look at the news publishers in "Five Star Final" or even "Unholy Partners"...anything for a story,for circulation, no matter who gets hurt by the publicity. Look at Walter Burns in all the versions of "The Front Page". Look at Sydney Kidd (Henry Daniell) in "The Philadelphia Story". In this film the publisher is a trifle closer to Charles Foster Kane. Earl Janoth does not own and run a newspaper or a magazine, but a whole empire of different magazines with names like "NewsWays" and "CrimeWays". He even centers it in one single building in New York City. And he has no doubt about his prominence. When his right hand man (George Macready) suggests he was not recognized by a witness, Janoth moans (a trifle loud for affect), "Everybody knows me." This film is a nice combination of film noir and study of a publishing empire. Kenneth Fearing had worked in advertising in a magazine, and had an idea of how they actually ran. His novel (which was recently published in the two volume edition on noir novels in the "Library of America" series of books) became a best seller and classic of that field of writing. The movie (with some changes) is a classic too. The issue of this film is can the hero (Ray Milland) manage to sabotage the investigation he is ordered by Janoth (Charles Laughton) to conduct, without Laughton or his ally Macready realizing he is the man they are seeking. It is done with style and comic timing (thanks to Elsa Lanchester, Philip Van Zandt, and several other character actors). Even Laughton and Macready are used for humor, although their characters are menacing. Macready has just set up the orders for Milland's investigation, and Milland (confused but trying to buy time), says "Right." Macready looks at him and says, "What do you mean "Right"?" And look at Laughton's silent reaction to Lanchester's portrait of the sort for witness Milland has to find.This is one film noir that gets better with every new viewing. Watch it by all means.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remade in 1987 as "No Way Out," the 1948 film "The Big Clock" is a wonderful suspense film starring Charles Laughton, Ray Milland, George MacCready, and Maureen O'Sullivan, directed by O'Sullivan's husband, John Farrow.Earl Janoth (Laughton), the owner of a publishing empire, is a quiet, enigmatic tyrant who loves clocks and has them all over his buildings throughout the country, including a big one in the lobby of his New York building. The clocks everywhere run together on naval observatory time. Janoth's right-hand man, Steve Hagen (MacCready) does his dirty work for him. When Janoth kills his mistress (Rita Johnson), Hagen cleans up the mess. Janoth is sure he saw someone in the hall when he arrived at his girlfriend's apartment, and feeling that the man can identify him, wants him found and eliminated. He orders his executives to get the man, telling them the person they want is involved in a war contract scheme. One man, George Stroud (Ray Milland), who is heading up the investigation, isn't fooled. He knows that he is the man Janoth is looking for -- and why."The Big Clock" is a great cat and mouse story, with Stroud ducking people who saw him in various places with the mistress on the night she was killed. He also attempts to leave the building to find a cab driver when someone who can identify him is standing at the exit with security people.Milland does an excellent job of being both cool and panicky, and Laughton's underplaying makes the character of Janoth all the more deadly. Maureen O'Sullivan is delightful as the long-suffering Mrs. Stroud, who's never had a honeymoon because of her husband's work. Elsa Lanchester is hilarious as an artist whose painting figures into the story.My only complaint is that the ending is a tiny bit abrupt, though very amusing.A really wonderful film for suspense-lovers, Hitchcock-like, and highly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Noir fans have found a hidden gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Big Clock, starring Ray Milland and Charles Laughton, is a great black and white thriller in every way. Unlike many noirs of it's time, it's not a B movie. The lighting, sets, talent and camera-work are top notch. The acting is perfect, as would be expected with a cast like this. Milland is charming and easy to route for. In fact, I usually find him kind of stiff - a little to up tight and proper. Here he seems to be a real guy with real problems. Milland was most famously known for playing an alcoholic three years earlier. In a kind of nod to that "lost weekend" there's a fun scene of him going on a bender in Manhattan - with unforeseen results. Like all noirs, a small wrong decision becomes a bigger and bigger problem latter on. When Milland decides to hang out with a hot blonde instead of going home to his wife, you just know he's gonna get into big trouble. And boy does he. The big trouble is Laughton.I've always enjoyed Charles "Capt. Bligh" Laughton. He was such a good actor. In The Big Clock he manages to be fascinating and loathsome playing the media empire kingpin. His character has no morals, and it's fun to watch him work. He clearly enjoyed himself making this film.Oh, and isn't Elsa Lanchester great as the crazy artist? Everyone know's Lanchester. She wore the most famous hairdos in movie history.Remade as No Way Out with Costner and Hackman in the leads.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Big Clock" delivers BIG suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I'm not sure I would categorize it a noir as much as I would a Mystery/suspense film. But whatever you call it, I call it a great way to spend 95 minutes. I can't recall a film that does a better job of building the suspense as this one. I was on the edge of my seat for the entire last half of the film.The film makes great use of irony to help achieve this - in that the lead character, George Stroud (Ray Milland), is called upon to search for a wanted man - who turns out to be himself. He is mistakenly believed to be the killer of his boss' mistress, when in reality, it is the boss, Earl Janoth (Charles Laughton), who is the guilty party. It is a classic cat and mouse game - except that instead of searching for the "Randolph" character, Stroud is actually trying to find the real killer so as to clear his own name.Stroud is literally surrounded on all sides by people who could identify him as the man who was with the murdered mistress on the night she was killed. He is running for his life within his own office building trying to avoid being identified. I love how the painting and the artist are used in the story. Elsa Lanchester was a true gem and quite a funny character. It's interesting to note that she was married to Charles Laughton. They certainly make an odd pair - especially in light of the fact of his known homosexuality.Another married couple from the film was actress Maureen O'Sullivan, who played Stroud's wife, and Director John Farrow. They were married for 27 years (until his death) and had 7 children together, including Mia Farrow. Maureen and Mia appeared together in HANNAH AND HER SISTERS (1986).Overall, a very good movie with a talented cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware The Boss From Hell in this Sharp, Twisty Manhunt Thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on poet Kenneth Fearing's suspense novel, THE BIG CLOCK (TBC) is not only a riveting hunted-man story with a fresh twist, but also a cautionary tale about what can happen if you let your job dictate your life: you'll miss your honeymoon and every family vacation; your marriage will suffer as your loving, understanding wife starts to lose faith in you and your endless excuses; your family life will be all but nonexistent; and worst of all, when your controlling, obsessive Boss From Hell kills someone in a fit of rage, you just might find yourself suspected of the crime! TBC is a family affair, with director John Farrow working with wife Maureen O'Sullivan, and real-life husband and wife Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester again sharing the silver screen. It's even a reunion of sorts for Ray Milland and composer Victor Young, the star and scorer of the 1944 chiller THE UNINVITED. Veteran mystery writer Jonathan Latimer ably adapts Fearing's novel for the big screen, its blend of suspense, urban cynicism, and smart, snappy dialogue intact. Some names and plot elements were changed, and the lovers' quarrel ending in murder, in which each accuses the other of being a closeted gay, now involves plain old straight infidelity. Nevertheless, the film's as gripping as the book, sometimes more so. In Fearing's novel, our hero George Stroud talks about the "big clock" which inevitably runs our lives no matter what: "Sometimes the hands of the clock actually raced, and at other times they hardly moved at all. But that made no difference to the big clock...all other watches have to be set by the big one, which is even more powerful than the calendar, and to which one automatically adjusts his entire life..." Film being a visual medium, the "big clock" metaphor becomes literal, with a huge clock/globe that tells you the time anywhere in the world, and lots of little clocks sprinkled all over the headquarters of Janoth Publications, a Henry Luce/Time-Warner-style magazine empire whose periodicals include ace editor George's magazine CRIMEWAYS, as well as AIRWAYS, NEWSWAYS, SPORTWAYS, STYLEWAYS, etc.Set in 1948 NYC, TBC introduces us to George (Milland) via our anxious hero's innermost thoughts as he hides in the giant clock in the Janoth Publications lobby at night (DP John Seitz's "docu-noir" style works beautifully). In flashbacks, we see that despite being married for seven years, George and wife Georgette (O'Sullivan) have never had a honeymoon. Seems that Janoth (Laughton) hired George for CRIMEWAYS after he cracked a major murder case on his old newspaper in Wheeling, WV, and the control freak hasn't given George a day off since, always snatching the Stroud family's vacations from under them at the very last minute. (George and Georgette have a little boy, George Jr. -- how cutesy can you get? :-)). With the prestige and great salary CRIMEWAYS affords him, George has always been reluctant to say "No" to Janoth, especially since the publisher doesn't take kindly to being turned down, but our hero is getting fed up. So is Georgette, who sadly notes, "Sometimes I think you married that magazine instead of me...We're like two strangers sharing an apartment..." Janoth's mistress, Pauline York (played with soigné insouciance by Rita Johnson), overhears George bellyaching to Janoth's right-hand man, Steve Hagen (George Macready) about his treatment at Janoth's hands. At the Van Barth bar, Pauline tries to involve George in a blackmail scheme targeting Janoth, but George isn't interested ? until he finally stands up to Janoth, gets himself fired and blackballed, and drowns his sorrows at the bar with Pauline, only to realize too late that he missed his train and his disappointed family left for West Virginia without him. It's LOST WEEKEND time as the tipsy George and Pauline go on a bar crawl, including Burt's Place, where they pick up a metal sundial from the barkeep's collection of bric-a-brac, and an antique shop where they outbid an eccentric woman (the scene-stealing Lanchester) for a painting.Unlike their affair in the book, in the film George and Pauline's relationship ends abruptly, with him waking up fully-clothed on her couch. Seeing Janoth's car on the street, Pauline hustles the dazed George out the door. Alas, Janoth is outside waiting for his turn with her. Though he doesn't see George's face as he slips out of sight, Janoth still suspects the worst. He lets Pauline have it, bludgeoning her with the heavy sundial, killing her instantly. The tight close-ups on the quarreling lovers' angry faces, especially Janoth's (nobody's jowls quiver like Charles Laughton's!), add enough intensity to make up for the bowdlerized argument. The desperate Janoth gets a brainwave: he'll have Steve rig the clues to misdirect suspicion, and he'll recruit the crack staff of CRIMEWAYS to track down the culprit, catching a killer and boosting magazine sales at the same time, led by none other than George Stroud! George can't turn Janoth down now; by leading the investigation, he can do a little misdirecting himself, buying time to find the real killer as the tension mounts and the bar crawl comes back to haunt him ? he's doing double duty as both cat and mouse! Milland's performance balances suavity, sympathy, and desperation. He and O'Sullivan ring true as a loving couple whose relationship is being sorely tested. Laughton is marvelously odious and sadistic with a pathetic undercurrent. Macready makes a stylishly devious right-hand man. The supporting cast includes a silent, sinister young Harry Morgan as a masseur-cum-henchman, Douglas Spencer of THE THING... fame as CRIMEWAYS reporter Bert Finch (not to be confused with Burt from Burt's Place, played by Frank Orth :-), and the ever-jolly Lloyd Corrigan as a radio actor who can play just about any character, including the bogus suspect known only as "Jefferson Randolph." TBC has been reworked twice, as 1987's NO WAY OUT and 2003's OUT OF TIME. They're both entertaining, but TBC is still my favorite version of the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An effete, continental businessman (Ray Milland trying to go American but unable to suppress his accent) is drawn into some murderous intrigue by two effete, continental villains (MacReady and Laughton) within the glamorous world of magazine publishing. Like another viewer here, I was excited to finally be putting this disk into my DVD player. My interest stemmed from the noir angle; but this is immature noir, more like Film Moderne. The movie parades slick objects past the camera, instead of making slick imagery out of commonplace settings, as noir does. It's a throwback to '30s Deco/luxe movies (moreso even than 'This Gun for Hire') with swanky drawing rooms, polite society, fey/snide villains, a generic love relationship with a 'good girl' (soooo NOT noir), and a middle-gray palette. A viewer wouldn't be surprised if Margaret Dumont or Fred Astaire showed up. There's no ambiguity, no dark palette, no dramatic lighting, and no strikingly composed frames. This is conventional, retrograde stuff, even for 1948.It's really ruined in its first minutes. The movie works a dozen clocks into its plot, but the strongest image is right at the beginning: Milland, trapped inside an enormous moderne lobby clock. If it starts that well, it must be pretty good right? Unfortunately the rest of the production is a gloss... It never shows us anything better. Clocks are repeatedly invoked but only as a gimmick, not an idea. 'Clock' could really use the jolt of energy and forward momentum usually supplied by 'the tough guy,' a type noticeably missing here. The box art shows Milland holding a gun, an item which never comes within 10 feet of him in the movie. The big difference between 'The Big Clock' and a good noir, is that a good noir is involving. 'Ray Milland' and 'involving' don't seem to occupy the same universe. The Coens borrowed this entire milieu for The Hudsucker Proxy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Big Clock keeps ticking despite the implausibilities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Big Clock' features Ray Milland, as George Stroud, an editor/investigator of a crime magazine. Stroud's boss is mega-publisher Earl Janoth, played by Charles Laughton, who hams it up as the arrogant mover and shaker of a publishing empire. Janoth is obsessed with time and has a giant clock installed at company headquarters, a modern high-rise, where the big clock controls all the other clocks in the building. Most critics will agree that 'The Big Clock' starts off quite slowly in its first thirty minutes. During the slow-moving exposition scenes, we learn that Stroud is Janoth's best employee, solving various crimes with the aid of his staff?they rely on a bulletin board which Stroud utilizes to organize various clues garnered during the course of their investigations. We also learn that Stroud is on the verge of quitting his job since Janoth will not give him the time to take the honeymoon he never had with his wife.The story begins to shift into high gear when George finally tenders his resignation but misses his train to meet his wife for the honeymoon. Instead he gets drunk with Janoth's mistress, Pauline York, and ends up at her apartment. Janoth shows up and George makes a quick exit; neither of the men can identify one another. Janoth and Pauline argue and Janoth kills her with the sundial which George purchased earlier at a bar. Janoth then enlists his right-hand man, Steve Hagen, to help him cover up the crime by ordering his staff to investigate the illusory 'Jefferson Randolph' (the name Pauline concocted and the person who Janoth ended up believing left her apartment right before he killed her). Janoth then orders George to return to work and find Randolph. George has no choice to comply with Janoth's order after realizing he may be implicated in the murder (Janoth mentions the inscription on the base of the sundial is from the bar where George purchased it).The tension in the plot grows exponentially as George must prevent his staff from believing that Randolph might be him. George locates a cabdriver who gives him information about another cabdriver who drove Janoth to Pauline's apartment the night of the murder. But Janoth finds the cabbie first (offscreen) and pays him off. After an antique dealer (who sold George a painting during his drunken night out on the town with Pauline) spots him in the Janoth Publication's Building, George must do everything he can to prevent himself from being identified by this man. To make matters worse, it just so happens that the artist, Louise Patterson (Elsa Lanchester), who painted the painting George bought at the antique store, was at the store that night and haggled with George over its purchase. She shows up at Janoth company headquarters and tells Janoth she is willing to draw a picture of the man who bought the painting at the antique store for a price. It turns out that George gets to her first and promises to compensate her for the painting. As the comic relief, Louise does draw the man's portrait for Janoth but it's in the style of an abstract Picasso!The climax of the story finds George in Hagen's office along with his wife and one of his pals from the bar where George lifted the sundial (later used as the murder weapon). A handkerchief which Pauline took from the bar is found in Hagen's cigar box so George accuses Hagen of the murder. Hagen manages to concoct various alibis until George's associate mentions that he saw Hagen return the murder weapon to the bar. Hagen no longer is willing to take the rap for Janoth and informs his boss that he'll turn him into the police. Janoth shoots Hagen and then tries to escape via the elevator but falls down an empty shaft (George kept the elevator cab on a lower floor after climbing out of the shaft and fiddling with the controls, preventing the cab from moving).Some have referred to The Big Clock as a 'film noir'. Certainly the film has noirish elements (dig some of the dark cinematography), but really shouldn't be classified as a true film noir. While Pauline York can be viewed sort of as a 'femme fatale' (her numerous affairs are alluded to), she doesn't lead the protagonist to his doom (George is more responsible for getting himself in trouble during his drunken foray on the night of the murder). More importantly, the protagonist, ends up prospering at the end. Think of a classic noir such as 'Double Indemnity' in which the protagonist (Fred MacMurray), the hapless insurance agent, ends up dead after committing a murder with the help of Barbara Stanwyck's quintessential femme fatale.Some have argued that the big clock is a powerful image as it symbolizes Janoth's megalomania. To me it's a rather obvious symbol and an awkward one at that. The big clock itself really doesn't figure directly in the plot. Contrast that with the 'The Stranger', where the clock is integral to the narrative (Orson Welles, who plays a Nazi war criminal, ends up impaled by a statue's protruding sword, which moves as a result of a clock striking at the appointed hour).After the slow-moving introduction, the Big Clock picks up and holds your interest for the rest of the film. Despite the good entertainment, the story hinges on the police not finding the body. You would think that one of the victim's friends would have attempted to contact her since she was missing for such a long period of time. Had the police found the body, all the machinations back at the office could not have occurred.The Big Clock is also worth watching for the trivia: watch for Noel Neal (TV's Lois Lane in the 50s) as an uncredited elevator operator. And Director John Farrow was Mia Farrow's father! There are other stories about the cast of this film well worth investigating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Suspense Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Farrow, directing a fine cast, including his wife, Maureen O'Sullivan comes up with a winner here. Ray Milland plays the part of an innocent, albeit irresponsible, man who becomes trapped by his own actions and portrays it with style and a sense of desperation that will make you nervous for him. Charles Laughton just reeks of power, greed and evil intent as the boss of a large publishing empire who is also desperate to hide his little secret. George McCready,who was one of the best supporting actors in films, is his sidekick and Harry Morgan is the sinister henchman who hunts for Milland under the big clock. Maureen O'Sullivan doesn't have much of a part in this film but as usual she is believable. And then, up pops Elsa Lanchester as the dotty artist who plays a key role in the mystery.......she is always a great addition to any film and often appeared in her husband's (Laughton) movies. The story moves along quickly and keeps you on edge as the hunted is also the hunter. It's really quite nervewracking as Milland dodges and covers up to keep one step ahead of the truth. Put this film on your list......you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George (Ray Milland) is never allowed time off work to spend with his family. Janoth (Charles Laughton) is his heartless boss who has a mistress Pauline (Rita Johnson) whom he accidentally murders. He then tries to cover his tracks and pin the murder on another man who Rita was seen with the night that she dies. The problem is that the man in question is George - and he is put in charge of the investigation.It's an OK lightweight thriller that is peppered with humour. The cast are all good but it is not fast-moving enough. In fact, it is extremely slow to get going. There isn't enough of a story for the first 45 minutes or so. There are daft moments - eg, George initially meets with Rita as she has information to give him regarding Janoth. We never hear what the important news is that she has for him and are expected to believe that they go on a drinking binge together without mentioning the original point of the meeting - on the evening that George has arranged to go away with his wife and son. What a load of cobblers!Charles Laughton gives a good performance as an eccentric, arrogant boss and Ray Milland is always likable, although slightly irritating in drunk scenes. Elsa Lanchester is funny as "Patterson" a slightly dotty artist. She provides a good moment in the film when her portrait of the killer is revealed........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Have To Be Patient With This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie starts so slowly you want to give up on it after 30 minutes, but you get rewarded if stay with it. Once the murder takes place, the film's pace livens considerably and makes the movie interesting. Ray Milland entertains as the innocent man on the run. Charles Laughton and George MacCreasy were good villains and so was henchman Henry Morgan (who never uttered a line!). Elsa Lanchester provides some humor relief in her minor role.Also in this deep cast are Maureen O'Sullivan, Daen Tobin, Rita Johnson and Harold Vermilyea. This is a film noir that's a bit different from most of the genre. It decent, but nothing spectacular. I've seen it twice but really doubt it's worthy of continued viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky and fast-moving hunt for a killer...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magazine editor Ray Milland has his non-stop working life pressed even further after he spends a drunken night partying with a gorgeous blonde; she's the mistress of publication czar Charles Laughton, Milland's boss--but when she winds up dead after a spat with her lover, somebody's gotta take the fall! Kenneth Fearing's novel (reworked in 1987 as "No Way Out") becomes cracking good thriller, full of eccentric characters, outré bits of business, acerbic humor, and a top cast doing first-rate work. The plot contrivance of getting devoted family man Milland involved with Rita Johnson can possibly be overlooked, as can Ray's staff at the crime magazine (who come up with clues and leads faster than Sherlock Holmes). Framing the story in flashback doesn't hurt, but one does get impatient with some of the implausibilities taken. Still, there's enough action in the picture to keep things tense, and enough funny, throwaway jabs to keep it enjoyable. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trapped By Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An oppressive preoccupation with time hangs heavily over everything that transpires in "The Big Clock". The eponymous timepiece is an enormous structure that dominates the entrance hall to the head office of "Janoth Publications". The clock is the most accurate in the world and is synchronised with all the other clocks in the Janoth organisation. Its size and position are symbolic of the importance that's given to time in everything that the organisation does. The proprietor, Earl Janoth (Charles Laughton), lectures a group of his managers about the importance of punctuality and the costs involved if people attending meetings are late. In one conversation with his mistress, he complains about being six minutes behind schedule and in another conversation, when he issues an ultimatum to one of his employees, George Stroud (Ray Milland), he gives him just six minutes to make a decision. Similar references to time and clocks continue to be made throughout the story and when a murder is committed, the weapon used is a sun-dial.George Stroud is the editor of "Crimeways" magazine and is expert at leading investigations in which his team find criminals on the run before the police do. He is trapped in a situation where he cannot fulfil his commitments to his family because of the demands placed upon him by his job. Things are so bad that, although he has a five year old son, he hasn't yet been able to get time off to go on his honeymoon. He promises his wife Georgette (Maureen O'Sullivan) that he will definitely go on their next planned vacation and although she is sceptical, he assures her that he will go whatever the circumstances. Predictably, when he is due to leave, he gets pressured by Janoth to cancel his arrangements so that he can see through an important project. Janoth threatens him with being fired and blacklisted so that he won't be able to get similar employment with another magazine. Stroud stands his ground and eventually joins his family on vacation. After only a matter of minutes with them, he gets a telephone call to tell him that he's wanted to manage the hunt for a murder suspect. He has no choice; he has to meet this request because he recognises that he is the suspect. He goes back to work and again finds himself placed in an even worse trap as he attempts to sabotage his team's hunt for the suspect who he knows is innocent and has been made the fall guy. A desperate battle against time follows as he tries to sidetrack his team's efforts whilst, at the same time, attempting to find the evidence he needs to nail the real culprit."The Big Clock" is a film noir thriller with a plot which includes murder, manipulation and entrapment and with a group of main characters who are all suffering from various degrees of mental anguish. Light relief is also provided, however, by many moments of wit and comedy. Ray Milland delivers a typically strong performance as the fast talking Stroud, Charles Laughton excels in his role as the ruthless, time obsessed Janoth and Elsa Lanchster's portrayal of the artist Louise Patterson is both humorous and eccentric.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this film a "7", though it was a temptation to give it an "8", but a "7" is my highest rating, unless we are talking one of the great films of all time. And this film is not that, but it is darned good.It is darned good because it is darned different. I can't think of another film that is at all like it (except perhaps the recent remake). It's a rather unique plot with a unique character (Charles Laughton) and a unique setting.The story begins via flashback. As it unfolds, Ray Milland's character (editor-in-chief of a crime magazine) inadvertently gets tied into a murder of a woman he met...who just happened to be the girlfriend of the magazine's's owner (Charles Laughton) -- a real sleaze bag...and the real killer! All the cards are stacked against Milland, however, and his desperate task is to clear himself and implicate the real murdered (whom he thinks is Laughton's assistant). What happens in between all this is clever and different, with a host of odd characters.Milland, whom I've come to respect more lately as I've seen some films of his of which I was not previously aware, is excellent here. So is Charles Laughton, although this is another role of Laughton's where we love despising him. And incidentally, Laughton's mustache here may be one of the worst in any film in cinema history! The other main character is Maureen O'Sullivan as Milland's wife, though this is quite a step down from her as she plains a supporting, rather than a starring role. You'll recognize quite a few other characters, though none is memorable, despite each being key to the plot.The ending is a total surprise, although it happens just a tad too quickly to savor.That's all not to say that there aren't some problems here. We all have had jobs we don't like. Why exactly are this husband and wife so thrilled to be without and income? At 58 minutes into the film you can clearly see the shadow of the boom mic. Why are Elsa Lanchester's children from 3 different marriages all approximately the same age?Nevertheless, this may very well be one for your DVD shelf!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another key difference between book and film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I posted a message last night about some of the differences between the book and film, and the reasons I think the film is superior, but it strikes me that I left out the most important one. The title, "The Big Clock," carries a much different meaning.In the book, it's a tortured metaphor, nothing more. There's a big clock up the sky, you see, ticking away, and there's nothing you can do about it, and it just ticks and ticks until finally something happens. This is probably not as eloquent as author Kenneth Fearing's explanation, but it ought to suffice. It's not such a bad idea, really -- the story is one of the best examples of the "ticking clock" device ever set to paper or film, and it's interesting to note that the book was written long before critics started using the term to describe stories of this kind. But Fearing uses this metaphor awkwardly. He describes the concept at great length in the first few pages of the book, and it shows up several more times throughout the novel. And yet it is inserted so clumsily that you have to wonder if he wrote the book first, and then decided he needed a dandy metaphor, so he added a few pages here and there to boost his word-count. It seems to be dropped into the narration without much justification, and the explanation of the concept seems to go on forever. It comes out sounding something like the narration in an above-average forties radio play, the sort of thing you might have heard on, say, Suspense.The film dispenses with this metaphor, at least in such an obvious way. Instead, it gives us a great big clock in the skyscraper's lobby. (There's no such thing in the book.) Beyond that, no one bothers to explain the title. The metaphor is present in the movie, of course -- it's just that the entire story serves as an illustration of the concept. It goes without saying; the idea is presented more subtly. No doubt the screenwriters decided that it was a terrific title, but if they were going to dispense with awkward metaphors, they needed a different sort of justification for the name. Their solution works. The clock in the lobby gives the movie a focal point. Better yet, because the movie opens with Ray Milland hiding from his pursuers within the "big clock," we know that a climactic scene will eventually be played out there.The screenwriters buttressed this idea with other clock references. Ray Milland is late for a train. Much of the dialogue concerns the passage of time. People keep checking watches. And notice that Janoth's girlfriend is beaten to death with a sundial?Let me add one other thought. The narration in the book and movie carries many similarities to the sort of narration you might have heard on the radio show Suspense, perhaps the best of all nourish radio programs. This type of narration was a standard device in radio and the movies, back in the forties. But there's another connection. In the original trailer for this movie, we see Ray Milland in a radio studio as the show Suspense is being recorded, and the show's director (Anton M. Leder, I believe) steps out from the broadcast booth to offer a testimonial for the movie. An interesting bit of trivia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice idea but too loose and convoluted for the most part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deciding to watch some film noirs recently this film stuck in my mind ? for some reason I knew the title and was sure I must have watched it before but it didn't ring any bells. Watching it two things hit me; the first being that despite the listing here and the comments made on the boards etc, this is not a film noir by the traditional definition ? it is actually a thriller with a man accused of murder trying to get out from under before everything closes in on him. This was the second thing because I realized I had heard the name of the film in connection to the Kevin Costner film "No Way Out". In that film as in this one, the main character is charged with hunting down a killer, all the time knowing that the clues will incorrectly lead to him and as a result he must find the real killer before he is caught himself.This sounds good but the film doesn't really make the most of it. The first 30 minutes are too slow and frankly unconvincing. Stroud is presented as a good family man, nicely cleancut but yet gets messed up drunk with a pretty blonde the very second he should be heading off on his honeymoon. This setup is labored and takes too long in the context of quite a short film. When the murder occurs the pace does pick up and the drama is engaging but it is delivered with a bit too much of a light touch and not enough urgency in the situation. The light comedy may appeal to some but for me it only undermined the tension and took me out of the moment ? if it had done this aspect better regarding the main character then it may have worked but it was far too gentle for me. The conclusion also comes too quickly and unconvincingly even if the buildup to the specific conclusion is pretty good.The cast are solid and it is not their fault that the film doesn't really make the most of them. Milland is a decent lead but doesn't convince me about the pressure on him ? I also didn't care for his character in the first 30 minutes as he seemed to be just a good haircut and cheerful outlook, nothing else. Laughton is a good presence and I would have liked to have seen more of him ? the film uses him well but it could have been better again. Support is decent and includes a very young Harry Morgan.The Big Clock is a nice idea that is slow to start and, when it does get going, it just lacks a bit of oomph to really make the most of the scenario. I was looking for the film to really close in on the main character and for things to be tense and stylish but in reality it was a bit too gentle for my tastes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film noir with a cluttered plot that takes time to build suspense...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Farrow directed RAY MILLAND, MAUREEN O'SULLIVAN and CHARLES LAUGHTON in this taut thriller that doesn't really crackle with suspense until the murder of RITA JOHNSON pushes the film into film noir territory.Before that, the opening scenes involve so much exposition and character development that it takes time ticking away on THE BIG CLOCK before we get to the start of a good, tense search for a killer.Milland is excellent as a man suspected as the murderer of his boss's mistress, when in actuality it is Laughton himself who has committed the crime of passion. He orders Milland to head the investigation and find the man that Laughton spotted in the hallway before he entered Johnson's apartment.A sub-plot involving Milland's wife who wants to spend more time with him (Maureen O'Sullivan) tends to get in the way of the main plot from time to time. But Maureen is lovely in a small role and she and Milland make a credible couple.GEORGE MACREADY is one of Laughton's henchmen and, as usual, is perfect in this kind of thriller. But it's ELSA LANCHESTER as an eccentric artist with a silly laugh who steals every scene she's in.The convoluted plot is sometimes distracting to follow, but all of the supporting players includes a number of interesting characters, especially those on the staff at "Crimeways" where every clue is written on a blackboard as the noose tightens around the desperate Milland or at the nightclubs and antique shop Milland frequented.Settings and photography are effective in creating the mood for an interesting film noir directed at a swift pace by Farrow, but not without some implausibilities in plot popping up now and then.Milland is at his best with plenty of nuances in his performance, even displaying a light touch now and then with his changing facial expressions.</fullReview>

Johnson, an attractive actress who had her career cut short by an accident and had a short and tragic life, plays the murder victim. Farrow (Mia's dad) is no Hitchcock but he directs efficiently and the cast includes O'Sullivan (Mia's mom) as Milland's nagging wife and Morgan as a menacing henchman. Lanchester (Laughton's real life wife) is hilarious as an eccentric artist. After a slow start, the pace picks up and suspense builds, not letting up until the credits roll.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An incredibly stylish and bizarre film noir. The use of art deco as a symbol of cold sterility makes this a wonderful example of visual design as dramatic statement -- murder and intrigue played out against an antiseptic background, contrasted with the more humanistic settings of the pawnshop, the bar where one can find "anything", etc. In addition, one of the most interesting things about this movie is the undercurrent of homosexuality that infuses it. Watch the scene where Laughton confesses the murder to George Macready. His protective reaction goes beyond a sycophant toadying to his powerful employer. And there's the encoded statement where Rita Johnson, referring to the check she has received from Laughton for "music lessons", tells Ray Milland that neither Hagen, Macready's character, nor Janoth, Laughton's character, likes music, thereby tying the two characters together. A fascinating and ingenious circumvention of the Hays code.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but rather unrealistic Hitchcockian thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Call me a disbeliever, but I find the plot of this movie utterly unrealistic. A pretty good one though; an action packaged, solidly built, suspense flick moving along at a sustained pace, as regular as the drumbeat in Ravel's Bolero. And its acting is the best, especially from Milland and Macready, while Laughton overplays his character a little bit. As for Lanchester, she's clearly enjoying each one of her moments in front of the camera, but it's Sullivan the one underused here, almost an afterthought?just see how almost nothing would have changed to the plot had they taken out her Georgette. Good cinematography also, especially with the overlapping shots, fade-outs and the group shots during the war councils in the blackboard room. An entertaining thriller, which I don't know why people insist in calling noir. In my book, a film noir is the application of the physical laws of entropy--everything in Nature tends to chaos, fragmentation and loss?to movies, so it's impossible for a noir to have a happy, or at least satisfying, ending. It always has to be bad, at least sad. If main characters end up alive and well, at least they got to be are sad because of losses or failures, even when there is no moral degradation--as it happened in Scarlet Street. Instead, the mood here is upbeat, even optimistic, so much so TBC could have easily been turned into a comedy--for ex., had the corpse disappeared from the lieu of the crime and had Pauline appeared alive &amp; well at the end, because she didn't die after all, but went into hiding, after regaining consciousness, for fear of Janoth. In any case this film has the looks and the feel of a Hitchcock and I would have certainly thought so had not known beforehand that was Mia Farrow's dad the man behind the camera.When I say unrealistic, I'm referring to two basic plot elements which make it hard to digest. The first concerns not so much the jam Janoth finds himself in after the killing of his mistress, but the way he acts in such a circumstance. See, I have lived enough to realize that the higher your social standing is, the bigger the things you may get away with--including murder. Janoth should have known better and realized that what he does then is stupid, something showing his lack of awareness about his own place in society, and that he didn't need to do any police job. Someone as powerful as him would have never acted the way he does.In real life, after thinking about it for a minute, Janoth would have simply called police and reported that he has just found Pauline dead when coming to visit her. Then, not much later phones would have started ringing in offices of politicians, chiefs of police, members of the judiciary, and every effort would have been displayed to get him out of the jam and away from the lieu of the crime and from the case itself. (remember The Sting, when the "FBI brass" orders the local policeman to get the high profile hoodlum out of the place where two men have been just killed; and he was just a bandit!).That's what would have happened in TBC: the intervening policemen would have been ordered to get Janoth immediately out of that apt. and to keep complete silence about his presence there. And even if he had arrived to confess the killing, that wouldn't have made any difference; he would have been shielded anyway, on account of his importance for society. Before TV, or the Internet, press barons were of great importance for the political and economical establishments. And even after that; just remember the Life magazine photos of L.H. Oswald holding a rifle, after the Kennedy assassination, which went a long way into convincing public opinion he was really a gun nut. That's the kind of favor men like Janoth used to provide regularly to people in high places, so was anybody going to rock his boat just because of such a silly thing, for a dead woman? That's why if a man like him had ever found himself in such a bind he wouldn't have even lost his cool. All he had to do then was to make a few phone calls, inform the right people, and wait there to be taken out of the jam, so he may keep performing such valuable services. (In fact Stroud himself recognizes this when he says to his wife: Janoth could find dozens of alibis, I only have myself.) If anybody doesn't agree with such analysis I invite him, her, to see the Italian movie Indagine su un cittadino al di sopra di ogni sospetto (1970) where Gian Maria Volonté--of spaghetti western fame--plays a Chief of Homicides who murders his mistress and who starts intentionally leaving clues around, linking him to the crime, as if wanting to test how far he could go; if he can get away with murder, so to speak, because of his high post. Despite all his efforts at auto-incrimination his peers refuse to take him in. The film ends in a surreal scene, where his comrades gang up on him, forcing him to confess his...innocence. That was brilliant, much more realistic than what's shown here. Imagine Janoth leaving many clues linking him to the murder and watching with amusement how the police deploy every effort to lead the investigation in some other direction. That would have been a fun movie, but another one also.Another unrealistic element concerns Janoth's nasty "hobby" of firing people at a whim, but his employees still laboring happily under his orders. Believe me, I knew one of such places and that's no picnic; rather a living hell. But an entertaining flick anyway, if you overlook all what I said. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'You are seven minutes late'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This terrific film noir mystery is based upon a novel of the same title by Kenneth Fearing (1902-1961), founding editor of The Partisan Review. The same novel is the supposed basis for the thriller film NO WAY OUT (1987, see my review), though there is little resemblance. The only things in common between the two films are (1) the lockdown and systematic search of a large building for a suspected murderer, in this case the publishing empire of the news magnate, but in the later film, the Pentagon, and (2) the big boss trying to pin the murder of his mistress which he committed on his own subordinate, in this case the news magnate on an editor who works for him, played by Ray Milland, and in the later film, the Secretary of Defence tries to pin the murder of his mistress on Kevin Costner. Otherwise, the films have practically nothing in common, and the later film cannot really be considered a re-make of the earlier one. The later film is really all about spies and international espionage, whereas this one has no spies or espionage at all in the story. Fearing was a well-known leftie who must have hated people like Henry Luce, the magnate who owned and ran the Time-Life magazine empire. The magnate in this film, called Janoth, is played by Charles Laughton, in one of the finest and most subtle performances of his film career. He owns a magazine empire with magazines having themed titles such as Newsways, Sportsways, and Crimeways. Clearly, inspiration was taken from the name of the magazine Newsweek. But the inspiration for the magazine empire must be the Time-Life organisation, an organisation by the way with which I have more than a passing familiarity, as I wrote for them for years. (I could discourse on Time-Life, but shall resist the temptation.) I have absolutely no idea whether Henry Luce had a time-fetish like Janoth, but who knows. Janoth is an unbalanced petty tyrant who fires people if, like Ray Milland in one scene, they are seven minutes later, or frankly if they are less than that or have even made a statement of opinion which he doesn't like. In other words, working for Janoth is to live under a reign of terror. Maybe Fearing is trying to tell us something about Henry Luce. The 'big clock' is the huge and expensive clock in the magazine empire headquarters in New York, which regulates all the other clocks in the building and symbolically represents the power of Janoth. When Milland, who is on the run, stops the Big Clock, we know that Janoth is seriously endangered and may be finished. This symbolism may be heavy-handed, but then the clock is big, so its hands are heavy. Milland is the brilliant editor of Crimeways, the monthly magazine about crime. He is able to find almost any criminal who has gone on the run, so Laughton ends up commissioning Milland to find the person he wishes to set up for the murder, though Laughton does not yet realize that that person is none other than Milland himself. Milland is in fine form in this film, not as languid as in many others, but instead full of energy and clearly enjoying himself. His annoying petite bourgeouise wife is played by Maureen O'Sullivan, and all she does is moan and complain and be tiresome. George Macready is outstanding as the smooth and sinister right hand man of Janoth. Macready knows how to make ice form on the camera lens, he can be so cold when he wants to without moving a muscle. Elsa Lanchester, Laughton's wife in real life, bounces about in this film enjoying herself hugely as an eccentric artist named Patterson, but she does not overdo it, and instead adds a useful whimsical dimension to the proceedings, so that everything is not unremittingly threatening and we do have a few moments of amusement. Rita Johnson excellently plays a femme fatale who is Laughton's mistress, and we know what happens to her, don't we? That will teach little girls to play with big bad boys. This film is superbly directed by John Farrow, husband of Maureen O'Sullivan (hence there were two husband and wife teams involved in this production) and father of Mia Farrow. (Maureen and Mia later appeared together in Woody Allen's HANNAH AND HER SISTERS, 1986, but John Farrow died long before, in 1963). Farrow directed some superb film noir classics in his career, including NIGHT HAS A THOUSAND EYES (1948), WHERE DANGER LIVES (1950, see my review), and HIS KIND OF WOMAN (1951). He was certainly one of the major noir directors, and THE BIG CLOCK was one of his finest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How did I get into this rat race?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Egomaniac publisher Earl Janoth (Charles Laughton) murders his mistress in a fit of temper. He then uses all his power and connections to pin the crime on another man seen close to the crime. George Stroud (Ray Milland), editor of Janoth's own Crimeways magazine, is put in charge of tracing the mystery man. Which is fine until he finds that as he digs deeper, all the evidence points to he himself being the fall guy!Ostensibly Film Noir it may be, but The Big Clock still has something to offer even the most casual of cinema goer. Directed by the still criminally undervalued John Farrow, The Big Clock has a touch of the Alfred Hitchcock "wrong man" theme about it. Based on a novel written by Kenneth Fearing, Farrow and his writer, Jonathan Latimer, have managed to craft a piece that is both twisty and unique in its execution. With both things working towards a quite clever and suspenseful ending.As with the best of Film Noir, The Big Clock has an intricate plot that's awash with dubious characters and sexual ambiguity. Headed by Laughton's tyrannical philandering Janoth (apparently based on real life publisher Henry Luce), the piece boasts what maybe a gay scar-faced right hand man? (George Macready) and a butch masseur henchman (Harry Morgan playing against type). Only in the wonderful world of Film Noir can such characters not only exist, but also be so riveting within the film's structure. The piece is also very funny, particularly when Elsa Lanchester's batty artist Louise Patterson is on the screen. I almost fell off my chair laughing during one scene as she hands in a sketch of the wanted man, Picasso would have been proud!But ultimately it's the story and Ray Milland's ability to see it thru that wins the day. Even with the odd little problem, such as the underusing of Maureen O' Sullivan as Stroud's wife, Georgette, thus the domestic strife feels like filler. The Big Clock still finishes as an excellently constructed picture containing interesting thematics on time (this will be down to the individual viewer) that's cunningly set in amongst a media empire environment. Remade with some success in 1987 as a political thriller (No Way Out), The Big Clock still remains the essential film to see. Crime, mystery, drama, comedy and a thriller, it has a little for everyone, even if it is ostensibly a Film Noir treat. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film noir!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking for an interesting plot, complex characters and a bona fide thrill ride; you really need to look no further than film noir. The best of these films have everything you could want from a thriller, and when you hit upon a good one; you're guaranteed a fantastic movie viewing experience. The Big Clock certainly is a very good example of the style that manages to include most of things audiences want to see in a noir, and keeps up a breathless exciting pace for the duration of the movie. The film takes the 'innocent man plunged into a desperate situation' course and focuses on George Stroud; an ace investigative reporter working for news rag 'Crimeways'. After an argument with boss, George finds himself on the shelf and hits the town with his boss' mistress, much to the dismay of his wife who, desperate for a honeymoon, sets off for it on her own. It's not long before George has had a tad too much to drink, and after being thrown out of the mistress' apartment moments before the boss arrives; he soon finds himself on the trail of her murderer...only this time, he's hunting down himself.The film starts off rather slowly, and it doesn't really kick into motion properly until about the thirty minute mark. It's easy to say that the first part of the movie 'is boring', but in fact this is the foundation that makes the rest of the film worth watching. Director John Farrow takes time to fully introduce all of the characters and the situation before cruelly pulling it all down; meaning that once we finally do get into the meaty part of the film, we already have a good sense of what the leading man stands to lose due to the unfortunate situation he's found himself in. The Big Clock stars Ray Milland who as ever, puts in an intriguing lead performance that fits the film well. The supporting cast is lead by Charles Laughton, who also stands out. Director John Farrow creates an excellent atmosphere for the film; it's constantly bubbling over with the tension, and the way we get to watch the central character work out what to do as he is placed on a double edged sword is fascinating. Overall, there are a lot of great noirs out there; and this is definitely one of them! Highly recommended viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Where are the green clocks of yesteryear?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taut thriller about a crime magazine editor (Ray Milland) trying to stay one step ahead of being framed for murder by his tyrannical boss (Charles Laughton). Ray Milland is great but it's scenery-chewing Charles Laughton that is the most memorable part of this movie. George Macready plays Laughton's crony and partner-in-crime. Rita Johnson is fantastic as Laughton's mistress. Elsa Lanchester has a small but amusing part that she makes the most of. Harry Morgan appears in an early role as a "problem solver" for Laughton. This was Maureen O'Sullivan's first movie in five years and her first non-Tarzan movie in seven. Director John Farrow was also her husband at the time so I'm sure that had something to do with her returning to the screen.A tightly paced film with a great script. Fine direction from Farrow. It was remade in 1987 as No Way Out, which isn't a bad movie itself. Thankfully it isn't a direct copy but a reworking of the original story. Both the remake and this original have wonderful (and completely different) endings. This is definitely one you'll want to check out if you're a fan of film noir or thrillers from the '40s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor Harry Morgan. Do you think he was as repulsed as he looked giving Charles Laughton a massage, sinking his hands into that fat squishy body? I don't know, that scene just really creeped me out. And then I thought about Elsa Lanchester doing it for real in the privacy of their own home, seeing as how they were married to each other. Man, I just got a shiver up my spine.Anyway, this is a neat little thriller, even if it's not a mystery once we see the murder committed by Laughton's character. That's when the fun starts as Ray Milland must use all of his wits to track down the killer as all the circumstantial evidence points to himself, even before anyone knows there's a dead body to be found. The film makes good use of eccentric characters portrayed by Lanchester, Morgan, Lloyd Corrigan, and George Macready, with the story taking some clever twists and turns on it's way to a satisfying conclusion.Actually, the ending struck me as just a bit haphazard, seeing as how the picture borrowed from any number of B Westerns of the preceding era. How many times have you seen the villain attempt to frame the innocent hero of the story, only to shoot the character that threatens to expose the real guilty party in front of witnesses. How does the baddie think he'll ever get away with it? Fortunately, the hero comes through as he did here, while the the real killer inevitably gets the shaft.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Big Clock is a wonderfully entertaining noirish thriller with, and unlike most of its deadly serious counterparts, a touch of humor. Ray Milland is a man trying to solve a murder. His problem is that the killer he's looking for is himself. Think of it as a cat-and-mouse game where the cat and mouse are the same person. The acting is top notch with Milland as the man caught between a rock and a hard place, Charles Laughton at his greasiest best, and George Macready as the prototypical "yes man". My only complaint with the cast is how Maureen O'Sullivan is underutilized. The supporting cast is terrific with Elsa Lanchester supplying most of the laughs. Very nicely done.Nothing against Ray Milland because he does a great job, but the whole time I watched The Big Clock, I couldn't help but think that the role was tailor made for Cary Grant. It might have made this terrific film more widely known.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Performances in Tense Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big Clock, The (1948) *** (out of 4) Tense thriller about a crime magazine editor (Ray Milland) who spends the night with a blonde (Rita Johnson) not knowing that she's involved with his sadistic boss (Charles Laughton). It turns out that after the editor sneaks out of the woman's apartment he sees his boss enter and the next morning she's dead. The boss tried to hide his guilt and puts the editor on the case not knowing he knows the truth but all the evidence points to the editor who must try and clear his name before anyone finds out. I'll plead guilty and admit that I think the remake NO WAY OUT is a better all around movie but that doesn't take away anything from this film, which still manages to be quite intense and highly entertaining. I think it goes without saying but the greatest thing this movie has to offer is Milland and Laughton who deliver terrific performances. Milland was always great at acting nervous and that comes in handy here because of the tension his character is constantly under. No matter where in the story you are you can just look in his eyes and see how panicked he is. Laughton, on the other hand, was perfect at playing creeps and he does a wonderful job with this character. The actor makes this guy such a snake you can't help but hear rattles each time he opens his mouth throwing out another demand. The scenes where the men are going against one another with Laughton not knowing what Milland knows is terrific and adds a lot of fun. Johnson is also very good in her few scenes in the film as is George Macready as the snake trying to help Laughton. Maureen O'Sullivan is wasted as Milland's wife, although the performance isn't too bad. Another very impressive thing about this film is that it takes place inside a magazine office where their job is to track down killers using their own method. This method of piecing everything together is quite clever and I think it adds a lot of fun to the film as they slowly pick up pieces that shine the light on Milland while at the same time he's trying to get evidence to clear his name. One of the best scenes in the film happens once the building is closed down and no one can leave without walking past a man who can identify the Milland character. The ways this is played out were quite effective and worthy of a few nail bites. I think some of the comedy in the film works but at times it goes a bit too far and the entire subplot with Milland's wife was rather bland and didn't add too much. It also doesn't help with plot holes including Laughton being able to give orders to lock down a building and being able to order people to shoot a man to death without the cops being involved. With that said, the attractive cast and tense direction makes THE BIG CLOCK a film that still doesn't get the credit it deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The leader of a crack team of investigative journalists is ordered to track down a murder suspect, and soon begins to discover all the evidence pointing to himself. The dilemma: how to elude his own investigation and, at the same time, locate the true killer? Complications begin to accumulate, with each new plot twist becoming more absurd until, at last, the entire knot of circumstance is neatly unraveled in several quick strokes. Charles Laughton gives one of his patented, meticulous ham performances as the dictatorial, clock obsessed publishing magnate, and Elsa Lancaster runs away with several scenes playing a dotty artist asked to provide a sketch of the hunted man but unwilling to identify her only patron. The film is enormously entertaining: one of the few comic thrillers that succeeds in being simultaneously sidesplitting and nerve-racking. Remade (badly) in 1987 as 'No Way Out'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully tense and dark in its sensibilities.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ray Milland plays a man who is overworked by his sadistic boss (Charles Laughton). The boss delights in firing people in his publishing empire and is one of the most malevolent employers in film history. When this evil boss becomes angry and kills his mistress, he sets Milland up to be the patsy--and offers a reward for his capture. And, since the facts do seem to point to him, much of the film consists of Milland trying to prove who the killer actually is as well as hiding from the authorities when suspicions turn to him. The clock from the title plays a pivotal role in the film and it's where Milland hides out when the heat is bearing down on him.The movie does an exceptional job in many ways. Not only are the characters interesting, the plot very dark and the story well-written, but the mood is wonderfully tense--with a great score and direction. I actually felt tense as i watched! Plus, it sure had a dandy ending....truly satisfying and entertaining. It's clearly one of Ray Milland's and Charles Laughton's best.By way, near the beginning of the film you should pay attention to the elevator operator in a tiny uncredited part. She is Noel Neill--the same lady who would play Lois Lane in the 1950s "Superman" show. Her voice was a dead giveaway. Later you will see Harry Morgan in a small role as a combination masseur and 'fixer'.</fullReview>

She is at her best when she is eccentric and this picture allowed her to use that vehicle to her best ability.George MacReady is in fine form as the sinister associate of Laughton, ready to cooperate with him 100% in planning the murder frame on Milland.Milland plays the typical executive who was brought to a larger company, with a big salary and all, but whose marriage has suffered due to his inability to get away.With it all, the film is muddled at times. You can go a little crazy by realizing that Milland is both the hunter and hunted at times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Stroud (Ray Milland) is a successful reporter at a magazine run by tyrannical Earl Janoth (Charles Laughton). Earl accidentally kills his wife but frames George for it (sort of). There's LOTS more going on but I wouldn't dream of spoiling it for potential viewers.Exceptional film noir. The script has many twists and turns and lots of rapid fire one liners that keep moving things along at a brisk pace. It's also filmed mostly in dark places or with darkness lurking within the picture--very appropriate for film noir. There's some stunning sets here too--it looks like this was made on a big budget. The acting is good too. Milland is excellent as a completely innocent man who gets caught up in the murder. You can see him fighting to control his fear and anger as things get worse and worse. Laughton, surprisingly, is just OK. He has a small beard which looks pretty stupid on him and seems ill at ease with the role. He's not terrible but he can do much better. In a small role is Elsa Lancaster (Laughton's wife) who is hilarious. This is one of the rare films where the humor mixes perfectly with the mystery. Also on hand is the then unknown Harry Morgan--who doesn't have a word of dialogue but conveys all his emotions through body language and looks on his face.This was remade in the 1980s as "No Way Out". That's not a bad movie but it can't hold a candle to this. This seems to be hard to find for some reason but it's well worth seeking out. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charles Laughton and a very witty script keep this afloat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film noir sometimes needs more than sufficient dark mood and a swell babe. It needs some ideas, or even a few laughs. The Big Clock does well to become perhaps one of the funniest of the films of the period that have murder, corruption, villains, average Joes and hot dames in the midst of a hot story. I think some of it may be unintentional humor, but I'm not sure; around a small crowd watching the film in a theater found many lines of dialog either laugh-out-loud funny, or worthy of a few good chuckles. This isn't something new to find in film-noir; watching Double Indemnity or The Killing and you may find yourself with more than a few belly laughs by the midway point. But The Big Clock relies on every character being witty, or just smarter than they should be (or sometimes dumber or not-all-there like the painter lady Mrs. Patterson - she gets the last line of the film and it's a doozy).Sure, the plot itself is dramatic enough, and with a good bit of twist to it. A reporter at a magazine (Ray Miland) is fired by the malevolent boss, Janoth (inimitable Charles Laughton), and he proceeds to have a night of drinking with a blonde girl. But she winds up in the wrong place at the wrong time with Mr. Janoth, and is killed. This isn't a spoiler so much since it happens relatively early in the storyline (at least at the third-way point), and from then on the real story kicks in, which has Stroud having to find anything that can help clear his name from the mounting evidence that Janoth does his best to mount - via his whole paper investigating - the disappearance and murder of the woman in the room. It's a mind-game that depends on finding the right people in time, witnesses, evidence. The cops can't help.Some of it comes close to unbelievable, but what keeps it engaging and entertaining, and sort of in an escapist way, is how sharply drawn the characters are. I hoped that Stroud would get out of his predictament, even for all of the harm he's caused his poor wife who just wants to see him in a job he likes, and hopes that Janoth would get his just deserts (albeit seeing Laughton and his droll way of approaching things, not to mention his shifty eyes, stole many scenes away from a believable Milland). Other supporting actors fill in well, like Lanchester as the eccentric Patterson, or the guy running the shop (I especially loved the random moment when a guy comes in and asks for bubbles... and he delivers!) There's also some genuine suspense built in by the director, which helps the inevitable of having to tie up the loose ends. It's enjoyable to see such a blatant baddie like the guy Janoth has with his dead eyes and black suit go after Milland towards the end in the clocktower. And, again, the dialog helps out a great deal. This could be a potentially simple B-movie, and in some ways it is, but it lasts way past its years because of its natural ability at amusement, and even being amused with itself. It's a little like if Woody Allen had to adapt a pulp paperback to a degree, neuroses and quirky characters included.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Rate Noir, With Laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not, in my opinion, one of the great noirs, but it tells a fast-paced, well-acted story with style, tension and humor. Ray Milland plays George Stroud, dynamic editor of a crime magazine, one of many in Earl Janoth's (Charles Laughton) publishing empire. Through circumstances, he meets Laughton's mistress one evening. She later is killed. Janoth puts Stroud in charge of tracking down the murder to get an exclusive for the magazine...(not much of a spoiler ahead; the killing is shown early)...and to cover the fact that Janoth was the killer. Milland is quickly set up to take the fall.Milland was edging into middle age and this added to the authority he brought to the role. Although he still had the charm and light comedy springingness, he is believable as a quick-thinking potential victim.Laughton is first rate. In a couple of scenes he scurries to the elevator or across a hall and looks like a fat, dangerous spider. He helps define Janoth's character as an indulgent, morally corrupt egoist by touching his mouth and grooming a small, ridiculous moustache with a little finger.Rita Johnson plays the mistress and is terrific. She's shrewd, sexy and sophisticated. She didn't have much of a career and, according to IMDb, apparently had a death worthy of a noir movie.George Macready plays a smart, cold, condescending lawyer whose ethics are flexible. His range may have been be limited, but Macready was one of Hollywood's great character actors.You might be able to find an old, used paperback of the book by Kenneth Fearing. He was a good poet who never made it. In the three or four mystery/novels he wrote he uses the device of having the characters speak for themselves in the first person, each to his or her own chapter. It takes getting used to but it becomes quite effective. Dagger of the Mind and The Loneliest Girl in the World also are very good and also, I suppose, long out of print. If you like mysteries (or dead American poets), give him a Google.Kevin Costner's No Way Out was based on the book and this movie. In the ring, I'd give Milland over Costner on points by a wide margin; Laughton over Hackman on points but close; Macready over Patton by a knockout in the sixth; and Johnson over Sean Young by a knockout in the first. And this version over the other by a knockout in the fifth. No Way Out's conclusion is, for me, unsatisfying because it drains sympathy from the Costner hero. In The Big Clock, the ending is satisfyingly concluded with an elevator shaft and, later, a hug and a laugh.</fullReview>

Then the camera sticks to him as he walks across and into an elevator. Cut and he is inside and we learn something about the elevator's door which features later.That clock. The fact that the building is a beehive of storymachines all driven by that clock. Then we fall into a conventional noir: average Joe falls into a machinery of fate that knowingly ruins his life.This guy loses his job, his family and gets framed for murder. Then the twist: he becomes part of the machine intent on grinding him up and the position of the narrator changes from inside noir to outside. It begins as a noir and ends as a happy Hollywood confection.This is an unsatisfying film to watch: the ending of the remake is far more intelligent. But it is a great film to start and think about afterward.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unusual Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A career-oriented magazine editor finds himself on the run when he discovers his boss is framing him for murder.Bruce Eder wrote, "The Big Clock is a near-perfect match for the book, telling in generally superb visual style a tale set against the backdrop of upscale 1940s New York and offering an early (but accurate) depiction of the modern media industry." David M. Meyer calls The Big Clock, "More screwball comedy than noir, The Big Clock's big moments derive from snappy dialogue and over-the-top humor." Not having read the book, I can't really comment on how well the film is adapted. But I will strongly agree with the second point. Although classified as a film noir, there really aren't a lot of noir elements beyond the murder aspect. It really does come across more like a comedy. But either way, Ray Milland is a real treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thirty six hours ago starts the beginning of the clock ticking down on George Stroud. He tries to put it together how he got here, hiding in the clock mechanism, afraid to move. We see him backlog through his predicament, being chased by everyone, the cops, the boss, his wife. Ray Milland is perfect as the suave man about town, it does not seem to matter to him that he is a husband and father. He gladly accepts the attention of other women, and to his wife's (Maureen O'Sullivan) dismay he is never around. Always running, always chasing the next big story for Charles Laughton the editor of Crime Ways magazine and others. The wife goes on a trip without him, as again, he has not shown up. Stroud goes on a bender with a blond model, Pauline York. She is Laughton's mistress. Laughton is great here, slimy and manipulative. Although dressed to the nines he is still physically unattractive. The only reason Pauline is with him is for the money of course. She wants George to write a biography of Janith (Laughton) so that they can blackmail him. He soon passes out in her apartment and upon leaving sees Janith arriving. Janith and Pauline have a row and Janith kills her. He goes to George McCredy for help covering up the deed. They find out the Pauline was with a man around town and they put Stroud on the search, not knowing he is that very man. This is great noir, and Milland is the perfect man for this part. As good or better than Cary Grant in North By Northwest. There is just something wonderful about the black and white photography that years later holds up so much better than newer film noir in color. Great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is remarkable for Farrow's idea of how to generate storytelling movement through the movement of the camera. There is no mistaking this for staged drama, or for a mere filmed book -- this is solidly planted in a cinematic world. Farrow isn't copying Welles, but adds his own touches. His camera is curious, it participates; but unlike Hitchcock, there is never a gimmick for its own sake. That zoom in from outdoors/dissolve to indoors opening shot, segueing to a levitation up the spiral staircase and a pull around and in front of the Clock is pure cinema. Then the narrative jumps back in time, and the camera shuttles around, breathlessly; it joins a board meeting; it's a patron at the bar; it relentlessly pursues Milland like the machinery of fate. The scene where Johnson taunts Laughton into murder was copied shot for shot in "Death Becomes Her", right down to the facial tics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The John Farrow Touch at Work with Great Actors!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Big Clock" is an example of an otherwise simple film made exceptional by masters at work, such as Ray Milland and Charles Laughton, but especially director John Farrow and his crew of technicians. Black and white photography, scenes gliding into each other, and taut direction of the action highlight this story of writer Milland working for publishing tycoon Laughton and getting caught up in a murder scandal. By way of flashback, we see how it all began, why Milland is on the run, and how clocks play a part in this sinister and fun film. With a solid supporting cast of George Macready, Henry(Harry) Morgan (who's spooky in a non-speaking role,) Maureen O'Sullivan (Farrow's wife in real life,) Rita Johnson (who I always liked in movies with her own little sparkle), and Elsa Lanchester (Laughton's wife in real life) in a scene-stealing role. In fact, Laughton seems to be the type of actor who doesn't emote much, but steals the scene from others in little ways. The plot unfolds and develops intricately but simply and it's delicious the whole way. This film really gets you in the mood for another film and another film, immersing yourself in the age of the old-fashioned movies they just don't make anymore. Period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Plot Is Outstanding. Now Watch It As Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once you know about this film, it's a given that the plot is intricate, involving and ultimately satisfying. When you see it for the second time, pay attention to John Farrow's direction - it's wonderful. I love the look of this film: huge sets that seem to dwarf the players, and the use of what looks like natural light in the early scenes, which devolves into stark, frightening black and white contrasts as the story progresses. In effect, the story becomes more noir as it goes along. Farrow also uses many long tracking shots, and photographs his actors from a distance, even indoors, to emphasize how the events of the plot will overwhelm them. This is a beautiful movie.The excellence of the actors only adds to the overall enjoyment of the film. Charles Laughton gives one of his usual eccentric but entirely true readings as the compulsive-obsessive, dictatorial Earl Janoth. Ray Milland is terrific as the smooth and not completely upright protagonist. All the others are spot-on in their interpretations. For me, the real standouts are the supporting players, especially Harry Morgan, every 1950s TV sitcom's favorite neighbor, in an uncharacteristic role as the boss' hatchet-man. He suggests so much danger with just a sidelong glance, but never utters a word throughout the film. And of course, Elsa Lanchester. Has she ever gotten anything wrong? She is so funny and yet so completely in control of her character. A truly underrated actress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't miss this! It shows you how exciting story-telling on film can be. A full fleshed-out plot, dialogue and thought processes that make sense, suspenseful situations that seem like they're going to drown the hero, and no down time or wasted scenes. How is it that a movie with no gory violence, no nudity, no obscene language, and no special effects can be this riveting? Because plot was king when Hollywood had real writers. Every scene in those '40s movies advanced the plot and the actors from that era are proving to be incomparable as time marches on. You don't need to see anyone in bed with someone to know they have a sex life and you don't need to hear characters use crude language or see them slice someone up to know they're bad guys. This movie will grab a hold of you and not let go. And think of it: in those days, the movie theater audience could get 2 gems like this for the price of one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>adds a different twist to the conventional noir tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ray milland and charles laughton (ruggles of red gap) star in this noir crime-thriller. one way in which this film is different from the other noirs i've seen is that the protagonist is not only a good guy, but is somehow able to escape death/prison by the end of the film. in most noirs you have the protagonist who willingly (double indemnity) or not (detour) committed some atrocity for which he must pay later. usually this atrocity is murder/theft and usually he does it because of a woman (whether coerced by a woman (double indemnity) or in order to be with a woman (detour)). big clock begins towards the end, as most noirs do (usually to establish the fact that fate is inescapable), where our protagonist finds himself in a bit of a jam. as the film plays out we find that he's thought to be a murderer when he really isn't. the bad guy(s) still gets his due by the end of the film, as is the staple of all film noir, but the difference here is that our protagonist isn't guilty of anything which adds a different twist to the conventional noir tale. throughout the film there is a definite emphasis on the importance of time - especially for laughton's character. i think that of this is, at least in part, to emphasize the ever-steady march of time, especially as seen by laughton's sudden death as if to indicate the fleeting nature of life. in this sense the film reminded me of a far lesser film called "the last minute" by stephen norrington (blade) which is about a character so obsessed by how much time he has left in life that it consumes him to the point of shortening it. there are a few other notable actors who have bit roles in the film - George MacReady (paths of glory), douglas spencer (double indemnity, thing from another world), and harry morgan (M*A*S*H, inherit the wind). surprisingly the film also goes against noir conventions by having a relatively healthy dose of comic relief. this film noir is still noir, but it's not the same dark world that we see in more prototypical pictures like asphalt jungle or detour. B+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare gem -- in more ways than one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my all-time favorite films, and while so many of my own thoughts have already been expressed by so many others, there is one other point worth adding. This movie is one of those rare cases in which the film is better than the novel. I know; I've read it.The novel, by Kenneth Fearing, takes a rather odd approach -- it's told in first-person form, from the viewpoint of several characters, shifting POV throughout. I wouldn't take it to task for that: It might be unusual, but it's certainly an interesting idea.But there are several elements that just don't work. For instance, the hero, in the book, is a former barkeeper from upstate New York. How on earth he could become a top editor at a national magazine is left unexplained. The movie's explanation -- that he is a former newspaper reporter from a smalltown paper in -- if I remember correctly -- West Virginia -- is certainly more plausible. The magazine setting, as portrayed in the book, is entirely unconvincing.The book bogs when it means to twist. Plot points hang on implausibilities. And the conclusion is certainly quite a bit different, and less dramatic. I guess this ought to be considered a spoiler, so be warned:*SPOILER ALERT* In the book's finale, the hero learns third-hand that Earl Janoth, the Laughton character, has committed suicide, plunging from the top of his beloved skyscraper. We -- the readers -- don't even get to see it happen. *END SPOILER ALERT*The movie's script tosses out most of the extraneous elements and boils the story down to Kenneth Fearing's astonishingly original concept. A man is trapped in a building. A manhunt is taking place, for a person unknown, in an attempt to frame that person for murder. The hero knows that the manhunt will eventually lead to him. He takes charge of it, and attempts to divert its course.These elements were present in the original novel, and the screenwriters took them and polished them to the point where we have a movie in which not a line of dialogue is wasted, and every word and every scene propels us toward the conclusion. We can feel Ray Milland's rising sense of tension as the net closes in. And if you watch the composition of the shots -- something I suppose comes easy for me, after watching this masterpiece a half-dozen times -- you can see that even the photography was carefully managed to give us a sense of Ray Milland's claustrophobia and fear.The only off-putting note comes at the end -- a bit of comic relief from Elsa Lanchester. But hey, in any movie, you can overlook ONE thing. The eighties remake "No Way Out" does not in any way approach the achievement of this film, but it's interesting to note that one element we find in the eighties version was present, in oblique form, in the book -- the intimation of homosexuality. (Naturally it doesn't appear in the forties version.) In its own way, the eighties film also takes an element of Fearing's story, and runs with it.Anyway, I can only think of a few examples in which a movie is superior to the book on which it was based -- "In a Lonely Place" comes to mind, and perhaps the more recent films "Fight Club" and "Election." "The Big Clock" is another one of those rare cases in which Hollywood took a flawed property and turned it into something great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's Always Lanchester</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stellar cast in a near-noir thriller. Any movie featuring the likes of Charles Laughton, George Macready, and Elsa Lanchester is required viewing. Watch Laughton look and sound a lot like Alfred Hitchcock as the slow-talking head of a publishing empire, along with underling Macready as the cruel-faced iceberg. And, of course, there's the inimitable Lanchester stealing the show as a middle-aged eccentric with a giggle so irrepressible that it blurts out like a leaky balloon. Pity poor Ray Milland who has to navigate past these characters to clear himself of a murder charge. The trouble is he was inconveniently in her apartment before Rita Johnson was terminated by sugar-daddy Laughton, and if the cops nail him first, he'll be doing serious time in the Big House, or worse. Now he's trapped in Laughton's tower of power with the clock ticking down and the cops closing in. Things look bad unless he can pull out a miracle and turn the tables on the wicked Laughton.Too bad director John Farrow's idea of suspense is ducking Milland into a dark corner. All the elements of a nail-biter are there, but Farrow's more interested in colorful characters and comic bits than breathing down the audience's neck. He even breaks the spell of the chase by prat-falling the comical-looking antique dealer into a camping trailer. For a clearer view of suspense, check this movie against its sweaty-palms derivative, No Way Out (1987), to see how it should be done.So, maybe he does drain the suspense, but Farrow clearly knows his way around boozy cocktail lounges. Those atmospheric scenes with Milland and the predatory Johnson are marvels of contact-making among the professional class. Scope out all the well-upholstered people bouncing off one anther like well-oiled pinballs. The movie really comes to life in these scenes. Speaking of Farrow, what's his wife, Maureen O'Sullivan, doing in the movie other than picking up a pay check. Sure, she's fine as the hand-wringing wife, but the part itself looks like little more than an employment opportunity in hubby's Paramount-produced money train.Anyway, for fans of the daffy Lanchester, this is a showcase. What with her pack of kids, each from a different "husband", I guess the killjoys relaxed their usual censor's scowl. Maybe to them, she just seemed too ditzy to be an unwitting agent of moral decay. But just watch her sly side come out when she cleverly up-ticks her extortion money from Milland, leaky-giggling the whole time. Yes indeed, whatever else, the movie does have its moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time Out For Murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An elegant thriller from the late forties, The Big Clock boasts impressive credentials, which include director John Farrow, authors Kenneth Fearing and Jonathan Latimer, and stars Ray Milland and Charles Laughton. Crime magazine editor Milland is framed by publisher Laughton for a murder the boss committed. Much of the action, such as there is any (most of it consists of ducking in and out of doorways), takes places in a large, intricately designed and highly specialized office building. This is a satisfying film, far from a masterpiece, its best qualities are secondary to the story itself, such as a brief supporting performance by Elsa Lanchester as a mad artist. Laughton's performance is self-indulgent and highly undisciplined, and one almost feel bad for him. This shouldn't have been a difficult part to play, yet the actor rolls his eyes and blubbers out his words as if in the grip of a seizure. George Macready, excellent as Laughton's aide, played this kind of role better, and I wish he had been cast instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>High Class and Glossy, this Lively Production is Filled to the Top with Big Stars, Big Sets, and a Big Story All Wrapped Up in a Slick Package for Post War Audiences that Wanted Quality Pictures for Their Meager Ticket Prices.Headlined by Ray Milland and Charles Laughton and Surrounded by Familiar Character Actors that Resonate, All Decked Out in Modern Fancy Big City Attire, the Film is a Treat to Look At with John Farrow's Artsy Direction and Fancy Blocking Using the Moving Camera in the Wide Open Indoor Spaces of Big Buildings that were a World Within a World.The Story is Complicated Enough and Interesting Enough for Mystery Fans and Crime Aficionados. Elsa Lanchester Devours the Scenery Playfully Adding the Comedy Relief and Wrings Every Second of Her Short Screen Time. This is Borderline Film-Noir and is Usually Included On Lists but Hardly Pure and Definite. The Strong Off Center Characters, Some Lighting Effects, and an Innocent Man on the Lam are its Strongest Noir Elements but Other Non-Norish Ingredients are too Prevalent to Make this Quintassential. The Corporate Takeover of the American Soul is a Subtext to All This and is Done with Symbolism and Clever Innuendos and is a Film-Noir Consideration.Overall, Not Without Some Weak Ingredients, Like the Back Story of the Workaholic with the Neglected Family, and the Opening Binge that Goes On too Long. This is a Solid, Highly Polished Picture that is Almost Magazine Like in its Pretty Pictures of the Post-War, Urban Landscape of Upper Middle Class Life When $30,000 a Year was a Hefty Paycheck and worth mentioning a number of times in the Film and was Laid Out for the Budding Capitalist in the Audience to Ponder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Remade some 40 years later in 1987 as "No Way Out" which takes place in the endless halls and corridors of Pentagon. In that film the unjustly accused of murder US Naval Lt. Commander Tom Farrell played by Kevin Costner spent almost the entire film on the run, as he's trapped inside the Pentagon, for being a suspect in the murder of the US Defense Secretary's, Gene Hackman, secret lover, Sean Young.In "The Big Clock" newspaper columnist George Stroud, Ray Milland,is trapped and on the run in the Janoth Building for a murder he didn't commit but was framed for. The actual killer being his boss Earl Janoth, Charles Laughton, is the person pulling the strings in getting Stroud killed before he can prove his innocence and thus implicate him in the murder. Stroud doesn't help himself in the matter by him being at the scene of the crime just moments before it happened. He also didn't help himself in being seen with the murder victim fashion model Pauline York, Rita Johnson, all over town the very night of her murder!The film gets a bit complicated with Stroud and his wife Georgette's, Maureen O'Sullivan, marital troubles in him holding off their honeymoon for some seven years. This leads to all the troubles that Stroud gets himself into by his chance meeting, at a local bar, with Pauline and later ending up smashed in her apartment before she was killed. It also didn't make any sense to me why Stroud after quiting his job to go on his long delayed honeymoon would then shoot back to New York to work for the hated Earl Janoth thus jeopardizing his already very shaky marriage with Georgette! At the time that Janoth called on him to come back to work Stroud had no idea that Pauline was murdered! All Janoth told Stroud was this made up cock &amp; bull story about black or illegal arms dealings, I'm not quite sure which one, that he wanted him to investigate for his magazine "Crimeway". So why did Stroud then so eagerly go back to work for Janoth who had just fired or drove him to quit his job! which not only may very well wreck his marriage to his wife Georgette but have him putting his neck in the noose in what later turned out to be Pauline York's murder?Having his head man Steve Hagen, George Macready, clean up the mess that he left at Pauline's apartment Janoth put Stroud on the case in solving it. Not knowing that Stroud was the man who was with Pauline just before he murdered her, and spotted him in him the hallway as he was leaving, this turned out to be fatal for both Janoth as well as his cleanup man, in fixing everything for him, Steve Hagen.The fine acting and directing, by John Farrow, just couldn't cover up the flimsy plot of the film that by its trying to cover up all its inconsistencies left a number of plot holes in it that you can drive a 18 wheeler truck through. The almost half dozen subplots in the film just made it that much harder to follow, if it wasn't complicated enough already, by stretching it's story-line to the limit. **SPOILER ALERT** Tying all the loose ends together in the last few minutes of the film didn't help either with the very determined Stroud, in his proving his innocence, ending up implicating the wrong man in Pauline's murder! This lead to the unbelievable climax of Pauline's actual killer-Earl Janoth-losing it and not only revealing himself, by committing another cold blooded murder, but ending up at the bottom of the building's elevator shaft, in his ill fated escape attempt, courtesy of George Stroud!P.S Late in the film a frantic George Stroud tries to get in touch with Pauline York, who he doesn't know has been murdered, and gives the operator her telephone number to get him through to her. The first three digest of Pauline's phone number are Butterfield 8! The very title of the famous 1960 movie based on the John O'Hara novel that Elizabeth Taylor stared in and received her first Academy Award!</fullReview>

Either way, everyone seems to have a negative view of it. And in "The Big Clock", clock-fetishistic publisher Earl Janoth (Charles Laughton) is a pretty undesirable person, namely because he frames employee George Stroud (Ray Milland) for murder. I like how the movie lets the suspicion of everyone evolve, and how they play the last few minutes of the movie. You may never trust anyone again after seeing this movie.

		<shortDescription>There is no escapement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is it that makes a movie a "film noir"? Surely, not that it was shot in the 1940s in black and white, that there are a couple of shootings, a mystery, and deceitful characters in it. Otherwise Charlie Chan starred in a series of films noir. "The Big Clock" lacks a couple of elements that I'd thought were standard elements of the definition -- a treacherous dame and a seedy desperation. Instead we have a loving if stressed-out wife, Maureen O'Sullivan and a playful but honest trophy girlfriend, Pauline Jones. And the people aren't in dire straits either; they're powerful and wealthy men, and their hangers on.SPOILERS. But none of that turns this into a poor movies. It's neatly written. Ray Milland finds himself the chief suspect in a murder committed by Charles Laughton. The spring is wound tighter and tighter until there is no escapement. The acting is adequate, not much more than that. Just before knocking off the girl friend he's arguing with, Laughton turns his face to the camera and manages to make what seems to be a single muscle, maybe the facial, twitch at the end of his lip. He has a smudgy mustache. I prefer him in more light-hearted parts, but then he was a very nice Captain Bligh. George MacReady is his usual oily manipulative self with a voice that sounds like sand. (Love that scar on his cheek.) The supporting cast has a number of familiar faces in it, including a young Douglas Spencer and Henry (Harry) Morgan, who I wish would make up his mind about his name. But, at that, I don't know that it's any better done than the Kevin Costner remake, "No Way Out." The photography here is dark in the interiors, and the exteriors are shot at night. If there's a glimpse of daylight in this film I missed it. It seems a bit gloomier than it needs to be because it is in the end a mystery/thriller, not a melodrama thick with fateful pretensions. Laughton does have one outstanding scene towards the end, involving his betrayal of his loyal subordinate MacCready, who, in the remake, was gay. The crime is about to be pinned on poor MacCready and he looks towards Laughton, who stares at the floor and sort of twiddles his fingers, saying, "All of our resources will be at your disposal, Steve. You know that." Laughton doesn't make a big scene of it for a change. He doesn't have to. The situation speaks for itself. And, I must add, it seems a bit much to have Laughton shooting people at the end (he's just not the type) and then backing into an empty elevator shaft and banging and caroming his way down to the bottom. Oh, well, So it's not a masterpiece. It's interesting anyway to view it as the source of Kostner's later version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good 40's thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Big Clock is a good 40's thriller which is incorrectly labelled a noir. It is the first of two adaptations of the Kenneth Fearing novel of the same name, the second being the more famous Kevin Costner/Gene Hackman version No Way Out nearly 40 years later. The plot is about a famous publisher, played ably by Laughton, committing murder and trying to frame it on the person he suspects of sleeping with his mistress. Unbeknown to him, Milland is that person and he assigns him the task of leading the investigation to find the person to be framed.Although it starts out slow, the film really picks up after the first 20 minutes as the plot settles in and the tension builds. The casting is very good. Ray Milland is a very good actor and makes for a fine lead. He does imitate his compatriot Cary Grant in the drunk scenes and was probably a more arty version of Grant. Charles Laughton is superb although he sports a ridiculous moustache. His dialogue delivery is very polished. He is a man obsessed with punctuality and detail and is quick to fire staff. Elsa Lanchester (Laughton's real-life wife) has a few wonderful and comical scenes as an eccentric artist. The director John Marrow and leading lady Maureen O'Sullivan (playing Milland's wife) were married in real life and were the parents of Mia Farrow.The main weaknesses of the film are the slow opening and a lame ending (which is true for the Costner version as well). This can't be called a noir. There is no femme fatale, all the characters are well-to-do (nothing seedy) and it doesn't have the style. That doesn't mean its not a great thriller. I don't know if you can compare Big Clock to No Way Out. I like both but found weaknesses in both. Big Clock is more believable till the end and No Way Out builds up more tension but finds no outlet or direction. I do wonder what a Hitchcock/Cary Grant team would have done with this story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie I've been aware of for most of my life but which had always eluded me, I didn't, in fact, know it even existed as a DVD until it appeared on my local library shelves on Saturday. By one of those uncanny coincidences a French cinema that screens what it chooses to call French Classics at 2 pm each Sunday showed yesterday Police Python 357, Alain Corneau's take on the Big Clock which appeared in 1976. As it happens I own 357 on DVD but having watched Clock on Saturday and decided Python was far superior I checked it out on the big screen and it really IS superior. Kenneth Fearing, who wrote the original novel, came up with a great idea around the same time that Orson Welles did; Welles called his idea Mr. Arkadin, Fearing, The Big Clock. Both share the same premise; a powerful man kills someone in a fit of rage, realizes that a third party has witnessed the crime so assigns someone to track down the witness, unaware - as is the tracker -that he IS the witness. There was a complete lack of chemistry between Ray Milland and Maureen O'Sullivan playing his wife, perhaps because the film was directed by her husband, John Farrow. It's almost painful to watch Charles Laughton's posturings as the tycoon-killer and in the last reel when he makes a dash for freedom his stooped, crouching run is a risible cross between Groucho Marx and Quasimodo (which Laughton had, of course, played ten years earlier. When you're watching the climax of a thriller you don't want to be thinking things like that. There was a remake in the 80's, No Way Out, but all you need to know is that nobody does it better .... than Welles and Corneau.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Weak Movie that Just Doesn't Pull It Off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd been wanting to see The Big Clock for a while, and when I finally slipped it into the DVD player, the excitement was fairly palpable (that's true, no kidding). Oh, what a misbegotten letdown it ended up being! A silly piece of fluffy nothingness that wastes quality actors, always a crying shame. I made the mistake of buying this movie and I Wake Up Screaming together, as my sum-total "payday" films (I buy at least two every payday). I of course didn't know how strong/weak they were, as I never read reviews before I see films, and I never will, but...well, this one wasn't as bad as IWUS (that movie was pure wretchedness) but it was still pretty darned bad. Or - better - it was just plain uninteresting, easy to figure out and preposterous in more than few places. Sometimes that's okay, sometimes it's not. It was just barely okay in The Big Clock, although hardly okay enough to warrant any viewing beyond the first one, and tell me, is that not the joy of noir? Multiple viewings, and beyond?If you ever see it and you tell me that the ending wasn't tacked on in desperation, I'll know you're lying. What a horrific waste, Ray Milland and Charles Laughton (picking at his undoubtedly fake mustache with his pinkie to hilariously distracting ends) acting to do no more than pick up paychecks.

		<shortDescription>Costumes Upstage The Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had the cast not included Elsa Lanchester and the great Charles Laughton, I doubt that I would have bothered with this film. A corporate executive named George Stroud (Ray Milland) gets caught in a tangled web of intrigue when one of the characters turns up dead. Stroud becomes the hunter after he realizes that he, himself, is the hunted. It's a complex story, one that starts out lighthearted and gradually morphs into a thriller.Characters tend to be shallow stereotypes; it's hard to get interested in them. Stroud is glib and superficial, and he talks too much. Indeed, he's something of a motor mouth. The film is rather talky, which dilutes the tension. And the dialogue lacks subtext.Because there is no femme fatale, and because of its ending, "The Big Clock" most definitely does not qualify as noir. However, John Seitz' excellent B&amp;W cinematography does convey a noir look, given the contrast in lighting.Costumes and production design are very, very dated. What amazed me was the formal wear of all the characters. They really dressed-up: men in their bow ties, women with their gloves and corsages. And those hats! I'm surprised that women's hats did not provoke more murders in those days: big hats, little hats, hats that flipped up, hats that turned down, hats with flowers or feathers or nets or ribbons ... what a fashion show.The nondescript background music is cheesy and manipulative, and in combo with the cheap and rather plain production design make the film look just a step or two above those low-budget Charlie Chan movies, women's hats notwithstanding.Although it contains a couple of nifty plot twists toward the end, "The Big Clock" is barely worth the effort. I did get a kick out of the always charming Elsa Lanchester. While Laughton gives a good performance here, the script is quite beneath him. Of course, if its 1940's clothes you're interested in, especially women's hats, this film is a ninety-minute fashion parade.</fullReview>
