		<shortDescription>A high-tech murder and cover-up thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a taut thriller and has a very good pairing of Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman in a story of a cover-up and murder. Sean Young is the tragic figure who falls for Costner and sets in motion the wheels that make this picture one of the best of its type. Plot twists and suspense are highlighted by great acting, and as the cover-up unravels, Costner finds himself in increasing danger in the halls of the Pentagon. Will Patton and George Dzunda are solid in support of the leads although Patton is a bit over the top as Hackman's attack dog. This fine film is marred by an ending that doesn't connect with the film's plot or pulse and gives the picture an awkward, unsatisfying conclusion. Costner is the hero but it is Hackman who makes this picture as good as it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant cold war thriller that is as rivetting today as it was when it was made in 1987.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"No Way Out" is one of the most original, suspenseful, tightly-knit thrillers ever made, comparable to John Frankenheimer's "Seven Days in May". Set in the Cold War era, Gene Hackman plays the Secretary of Defense, a married man obsessed with his mistress, the exquisitely beautiful Sean Young...as is her other secret lover, Costner, a Naval Admiral who is the C.I.A.'s Liaison. When Hackman accidentally kills Young in a jealous rage, a cover-up begins to find the notorious, never-seen Russian mole "Yuri" who works within the Pentagon, and to frame him for the murder. Costner is commanded to oversee the operation, and the action begins...and is sustained with the intensity of a race on the Autobahn. The amazing all-star cast also features Will Patton, George Dzunda, Iman and David Paymer. Costner delivers what is perhaps his most subtle performance. What distinguishes "No Way Out" is its brilliant plotting, tautness, and constant surprises...with the ending being the most deliriously mind-blowing surprise of all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely underrated first-class thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are only a fistful movies I gave 9 points. This is one them. After watching it I immediately had an itch to watch a sequel (regrettably impossible due to the story line). Didn't actually want it to stop and was sad that it ended. (True for just a few other movies, like for example Dr. Zhivago or 12 Monkeys) When I checked the IMDb - rating composition to find out why this movie is so grotesquely underrated, I asserted that the IMDb Staff gave 8 points, anyway. (Phew!) One of the very few US-thrillers, the end of which I wasn't able to predict. Gene Hackman and Kevin Costner are habitually brilliant, Will Patton deserves an Oscar as the best supporting actor in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kevin Costner stars in this stylish remake of THE BIG CLOCK, a 1948 film noir that starred Ray Milland and Charles Laughton. The setting has been changed from a publishing house to the Pentagon and the time period updated. Some extra plot twists have been added and it all adds up to riveting entertainment after a slow start.Costner romances Sean Young after a brief flirtation and then discovers she is the mistress of the U.S. Secretary of Defense (Gene Hackman). In a fit of jealousy, Hackman accidentally kills Young and then must concoct a plot to keep his identity as her lover a secret. He assigns Costner to lead the investigation and this leads to a suspenseful turn of events that has Costner caught in a net from which he has a hard time escaping. A series of suspenseful chases take place with some excellent camerawork following the chase by car and on foot. Only weakness here is the rather contrived ending which seems to have been added on for a final twist that is never quite convincing.Kevin Costner, looking spiffy in his smart Navy white uniform, does an excellent job as a desperate man realizing he must keep his own affair with the victim a secret. Gene Hackman is excellent too but it is Will Patton as his loyal henchman and protector who gives the film's most penetrating performance, especially when his diabolical nature is revealed.The first twenty-five minutes are much too slow in getting the story off the ground but once it does you'll want to stay tuned until the final denouement. One of the best thrillers produced in the '80s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No Way Out is a suspense movie set during the cold war. Political intrigue within the US government is the focus of the film. The politically powerful Brice accidentally kills his mistress. Things get out of hand and he decides to frame her other lover as a spy. He knows that she is seeing someone else but has no idea who. Farrel, her other lover, is the man assigned to her case. He realizes that the investigation will eventually expose him, and when the investigators begin using a computer to restore a partially developed polaroid of Farrel found in the dead girl?s things he has a good idea of how much time he has. There are some tense moments as Farrel trys to expose Brice before he is caught. Also there are a string of neat twists at the end, which succeed in not being corny. This is worth your time. I definitely recommend it for fans of military suspense or cold war movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Washington, the Defense Secretary David Brice (Gene Hackman) has a political dispute with Senator William 'Billy' Duvall (Howard Duff) about the project of a submarine. He asks his adviser Scott Pritchard (Will Patton) to invite the Navy Lieutenant Commander Tom Farrell (Kevin Costner), who has become a national hero after rescuing a sailor during a storm, to join his team. Farrell meets Susan Atwell (Sean Young) in a party and they have a torrid love affair. Farrell learns that Susan is Brice's mistress but he falls in love with her. They spend a weekend together and when they return to Susan's apartment, Brice rings the bell. The upset Farrell leaves the apartment and sees Brice waiting for Susan. Brice has an argument with Susan and pushes her from the balcony. She falls on a glass table and dies. Brice panics and reports the accident to Pritchard. However, the Machiavellian chief of staff accuses the imaginary Soviet mole Yuri of murdering Susan. Farrell is assigned to lead the investigations to find the identity of Yuri, and gets in serious situation with the presence of witnesses of his weekend with Susan and the regeneration of a Polaroid photo that was found in Susan's apartment. "No Way Out" is an excellent thriller of the 80's even when you see it for the fourth time. The impact of course is reduced, since the plot has one of the most unexpected conclusions, with a twist in the very end that was the motive of several discussions with friends, but it is still a great film. This is one of the best roles of Kevin Costner and Sean Young is incredibly beautiful and sensual. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Sem Saída" ("No Way Out")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty good government thriller with some nice twists...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having lived around the outskirts of Washington, D.C. myself, it's always a nice treat to watch a film that literally takes place right where I have stood, at one time or another. It's just very fun to know that a famous movie was shot where you once walked. (Although I now regret visiting the set of "101 Dalmations" in London--that's one story I don't often tell people with a smile on my face.)At the beginning of "No Way Out," we get to see Washington from above as the camera glides through the air, swerving and going around in circles, until we land inside a small interrogation room housing a convicted murderer (Kevin Costner), who is in fact innocent and has been framed. "When's he coming out?" he asks as he walks over to a one-way mirror and looks through the glass. Right as we start to think, "Whom is he talking to?" (Or "Does he mean Hackman?" if you've read anything about the film), we fall backwards in time and land in the same place some number of months earlier."No Way Out" is a government thriller about an officer wrongly accused of murder--when the Secretary of State himself is the culprit trying to avoid a scandal by launching a top-secret cover-up. Costner is the officer, and Gene Hackman is the Secretary of State. After meeting a beautiful young woman (Sean Young) at a party, Costner takes her into a limo and they have a quickie--before they even know each other's names. What's this got to do with anything? Why is my review so choppy and linear-challenged? We'll get there.The relationship between the two turns into a big romance until Costner is sent out to sea, where he saves a sailor from falling overboard and is praised in all the papers--where his girlfriend back home sees his face and is reminded of him. (Now she's the mistress of Hackman, by the way--that complicates matters quite a bit.)When he arrives back home, they go on a romantic getaway--but Hackman finds out and accidentally murders the girl while trying to get her to tell him the name of her lover. Ready to turn himself in, Hackman is persuaded by his gay friend to cover everything up and blame someone else. The gay man even goes and gets rid of the evidence himself--with pride, I might add. (It's like Mr. Burns and Smithers from "The Simpsons"--the latter loves the former, but the former is too powerful and naive to ever notice.)The clever twist in "No Way Out" is that Costner knows Hackman killed Young, but Hackman doesn't know that he knows that. (Get it?) As he runs around the Pentagon and other government establishments, the evidence starts to pile up against him--the negative off the back of a Polaroid camera, a few eyewitnesses who claim they saw a man outside Young's apartment the night of her murder, etc.The great thing about "No Way Out," and another factor that separates it from the rest of its kind, is something that's hard to explain to someone who hasn't seen the film. Essentially, no one knows who killed the girl--and Costner isn't placed under arrest straight away because no one has uncovered any evidence pointing towards him. As the negative off the back of the Polaroid is scanned through a computer and painstakingly altered to reveal the man's face on the photo, Costner runs around trying to eliminate evidence before anyone finds out. The photo will eventually reveal his own face, yes, but he has a number of hours until then to find the true evidence that convicts Hackman.This is a smart thriller with a few pleasant twists, particularly the very end. It's not a great movie by any means, but it's well-acted and solidly directed by Roger Donaldson, who also made last year's "The Recruit" with Al Pacino and Colin Farrell. The guy obviously likes government thrillers. This one is a lot more plausible than "The Recruit," too.4/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cold War Spy Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember being in the theater with my friend, and she turned to me and said about Costner "He is just so good in this film" and I replied "He will be somebody someday." This was that kind of film. You felt the performances in your bones.The film had that type of chemistry between all the major players. The plot would just seem like it was going to lag and then you get twisted around again. Three years later I went out and bought the script with a month's worth of money from my first job. I still have that script on my bookshelf. I also have had a copy of this film in my collection for the last 10 years.Sean Young was still at her peak and the limousine scene is unforgettable. It is also proof that you can add sex in a movie without making the audience think they will be taking time away from the theme and plot of the movie. Will Patton of Remember the Titans was also starting his movie career and played his character of a "protect the Director at any cost" to a "T". Gene Hackman was Brice in this movie.George Dzundza as the loyal friend, Iman as the South African caught in the middle of her friend's indiscretion and Chris D. as one of the "Contras" helped round out the supporting cast.Roger Donaldson's direction really helped you feel the tense pace and the closed in feelings in the Pentagon.I gave this film a 9 because it may be seen as outdated due to some cold war references.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Farrell is offered a job within the Defence department under Brice, the secretary of defence. When the two begin seeing the same woman, Farrell is forced to do so quietly so that Brice doesn't know. When Brice finds that Susan is seeing another woman he accidentally kills her. In order to cover up Brice's involvement, his aide Pritchard engineers a theory that the "other man" in Susan's life was the one that killed her and that he is a legendary Russian spy. In order to keep control of the investigation, Farrell is put in charge of the investigation and is faced with clues that he knows will eventually lead to him. With the set-up closing in on him he must race against time to find a way out.This is a remake of The Big Clock, with a modern political set-up. The story is well set-up with only some misgivings in the first 30 minutes where the roots for the story are developed. Once the real story starts it is very good and it moves with a real thrilling pace, building to two endings one very powerful and with a feeling of being trapped, and the second being a clever if not totally convincing twist. The feeling of being trapped and closed in on is very palatable and is very well conveyed for most of the film.Costner is excellent here (a long time before his bubble burst) and Hackman brings his usual class. The standout role is Patton's smarmy, spin doctor homosexual Pritchard, he is truly excellent and manages to bring a sense of menace to a quite feminine role.Overall an excellent thriller that is slow to start and has a low-key ending. The only problems are the slightly stretched plot and some of the action being unexplained (why do the covert-ops guys keep chasing Costner? I understood why for one of the chases but other ones just seem to happen for no reason). But 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think I can ever remember a movie quite like this. It has hooks in it that are so refreshing and unexpected. It has performances that are just brilliant. Moreover, it is a movie in which Kevin Costner looks at his most natural best. The story basically revolves around Costner's character trying to discover who killed his lover, before he is framed for it. Of course, he is trying to do this in a closed off Pentagon building while eyewitnesses are being brought in just to point out him. Of course, you have side stories going on everywhere. I don't want to give away any of the little switches or the big one. I will just say, that if you want to see a well done thriller, this is it. Great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the depth of fourth time around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just hauled this off the shelf and watched it for the umpteenth time. Flawed though it is, I love it. The controversy amid reviewers is surprising to me; but perhaps I don't watch sufficient "thrillers" to have a list of expectations--which several folks seem to have found unfulfilled. Spoilers: "No Way Out" is composed of one surprise after another...a series of surprises, if you will. From learning that Tom and Susan's original meeting was contrived by others to the shock of her murder, to the reappearance of the forgotten Polaroid negative, to the murder of the IT man and the final scene, with its suspense-filled last scene, I--as a repeat viewer--was constantly aware of Tom's reaction to every incident in the light of what the ending revealed to us....as well as what it did not. The last line, "let him go. He'll be back. He has nowhere else to go" is so poignant.This is very early Costner. The work of a business administration major who suddenly decided he wanted to act. The subtleties in what I understand was only his second performance are astonishing. If you didn't like it, forget it. but if you did, I strongly recommend watching it at least three times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid thriller that raises above average thanks to fantastic final</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For most of it's time "No way out" is a conventional and good thriller . The movie proceeds as expected . Still , the more you watch the movie the more your are dragged into the story . Roger Donaldson certainly directs it with confidence . In the end , when the last half of hour comes you will be rewarded by the story . There is both adrenaline and shock for you there.Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman deliver what you could expect from them. Costner is quite wooden , but tolerable . Hackman is good . If you seen him in "Absolute power" you won't be surprised by his performance here. George Dzundza gives a memorable performance as a scientist on a wheelchair.Two persons steal the show . Sean Young hasn't got too much screen time, yet she fills the movie with energy and vulnerability when she's on screen. Will Patton gives the best performance of the movie as a man dedicated to Hackman . He's two-faced , cold , cynical and ruthless. A nomination for Oscar would do him justice.I give it 8/10 . Watch it . You won't regret it . The final is worth watching itself. Mind blowing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thriller That Keeps You on the Edge of Your Seat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No Way Out (1987) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Excellent thriller has the Defense Secretary (Gene Hackman) killing his mistress (Sean Young) not knowing that a man who works for him (Kevin Costner) was also with the woman and witnessed him entering her home shortly before the murder. NO WAY OUT is without question one of the very best thrillers of the decade and no matter how many times you've seen it the film always manages to grab you in its grip and take you along for the ride. This is one of those thrillers that keeps you on the edge of your seat and it really lives up to the title because throughout the entire film just more and more starts to pile up on the Costner character that you never know how he's going to get out of it. I thought the screenplay did a terrific job at making sure the film was always one step ahead of the viewer and this just gave us more suspense and especially since we know Costner is innocent and we don't see a way he can prove it. It also helps that the performances are so wonderful with Costner and Hackman leading the way with two superb pieces of work. Young is also good in her short time on the screen as she perfectly handles the sexuality but she also makes us see and feel why Costner would fall for her. Will Patton is also terrific in his bit and you have to say he's one of the most memorable and slimy villains from the decade. The supporting cast includes good work from George Dzundza, Marshall Bell and Fred Thompson. The film has many twists and turns and I'd say all of them work with the exception of a murder that happens towards the end. I'd say what happens to this character and who does the killing was a bit too far fetched for me but there's still no question that this is a powerful film and one that tends to be very underrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast, suspenseful thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay. The plot has more holes than the brain of a cow suffering from bovine spongiform disorder. So what? The whole movie is fast, palatable, and most important of all, not entirely insulting to the viewer. The story has already been described so I won't go into it except to say that it's an improvement over its source, "The Big Clock," and probably the novel that work was based on. It doesn't depend on special effects. There is only one car chase, ending in a foot race, and it's mercifully brief and doesn't end in an exploding fireball. In fact nothing ends in an exploding fireball. Tears of gratitude brim from my eyes, just being able to write that sentence.There's a completely unnecessary plot twist at the very end that leaves final developments ambiguously open. But, that aside, and given a bit of effort at the suspension of disbelief, events hang together logically and build on one another. And we follow them tensely as one improbability leads to another. The movie has images that impress themselves on the viewer's perception, willy nilly, whole scenes and little bits of business.We have, first of all, Kevin Costner as a naval officer all of us can identify with -- he's smart, heroic, handsome, virile, important, and looks very spiffy in his immaculate white uniform and shoes as he skips or runs full tilt through the sterile corridors of the Pentagon, pursued by devils or by two brainless thugs in dark suits, one of whom sprints in a more than usually awkward manner, his arms flapping gracelessly at his sides. Costner's acting. It's okay. He still sounds and looks like an innocent all-American surfer but he can't help that. Now and then he actually successfully projects the feelings and thoughts of his character. (I couldn't figure out what the gold badge on his uniform was; it looks like neither a submariner's dolphins nor an aviator's wings.) Sean Young -- wow! Has any body, I mean anybody ever been more classically assembled? Her face is full of good bone structure. It has no quirkiness. She's beautiful in the way a painting of a woman would be beautiful if you took a portrait artist, sat him down, and asked him to dream up a pretty woman and get it down on canvas. Her face is an operational definition of "conventional beauty." And it doesn't stop with her face. She exudes a kind of sensuality that seems unaware of its own appeal, only aware of its own needs. She's foxy in the most negligent kind of way, the kind of woman who might not draw the curtains at night -- not because she enjoys showing off but because she just doesn't care. She may not lay waste the countryside as an actress, but doesn't need to. And what she says is believable enough. Gene Hackman is supposed to be a misled good guy. Yet he's guilty of, what?, would it be manslaughter? Womanslaughter? First-degree male chauvinist swinery? His character is supposed to be basically sympathetic, and he and the director play it that way, after establishing him as a politician unwilling to play along with the militarists in Congress. But he's pretty weaselly when you come right down to it -- begging Costner not to give him away, promising him anything -- promotions, better jobs, whatever. And in the end he seems willing to let all the blame fall on his assistant, Will Patton. In many ways, it's Patton's movie. Patton is to Hackman more or less what Martin Landau was to James Mason in "North by Northwest," a jealous and protective buffer between his master and the rest of the world. And Patton does a superb job here. After accidentally killing his girl friend, Hackman stumbles into Patton's apartment, needing "someone to talk to before I go to the police." As Hackman spills out his story, Patton hovers over him with a troubled meaningless grin, both his hands fluttering around Hackman's shoulders from behind, as if ready to massage his trapezius. Patton's eyes bulge with surprise and concern. In an earlier scene when Hackman is dressing for a date with Young, Patton carefully brushes some unseen specks from the shoulders of Hackman's dark jacket, preparing his crush for an encounter with his own rival. And watch the expression on Patton's face when he's alone in the gymnasium with George Dzunza and Dzunza spills the beans about Costner's knowing everything. The changes Patton's features undergo are so subtle, the stretched fatuous smile relaxing into the open mouth of utter surprise. What an opportunity for a lesser actor to overplay the reaction, but Patton holds it all in place. That grin turns from idiotic to reassuring in a scene in which Hackman hits Patton in the head with a neatly flung folder full of papers. In context, the actor's natural slight lisp is menacingly telling. We really didn't need Fred Dalton Thompson to inform us in his boring monotone that the character was "a homosexual." I suppose the line was in the script because it was designed to enlighten some elderly folks who may never have left their home in Elko.It's a catchy movie. I didn't find the opening that slow. Except I guess I've seen enough heated sexual encounters in the back seats of limos and taxis. This one harks back to Angie Dickinson's scene in DePalma's "Dressed to Kill." Knowing DePalma one wonders if the idea came to him from Hitchcock's oft-repeated fantasy of the woman who acts like a perfect lady until she gets you in the back seat of a taxi and immediately opens your pants. (In Hitchcock's fantasies it was always an icy blonde.) It's worth seeing this, if only to watch the visual imagery, enjoy the acting, and let the narrative take you along in its own exciting way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Counting down the hours for some self investigation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No Way Out is directed by Roger Donaldson and adapted to screenplay by Robert Garland from the novel "The Big Clock" written by Kenneth Fearing. It stars Kevin Costner, Gene Hackman, Sean Young, Will Patton, George Dzundza and Howard Duff. Music is by Maurice Jarre and cinematography by John Alcott.Already filmed impressively as The Big Clock in 1948, Fearing's ingenious source material gets a shift to a Pentagon backdrop and still comes out a winner. Putting their own spin on the central story, that of a man finding he is investigating "himself" during a murder enquiry, the makers unfurl a labyrinthine plot that keeps up the suspense quota right to the very end.In true noir style, the story is crammed with double bluffs, deceit, sex and death, with the added ingredient of politico intrigue to spice things still further. Cast are led superbly by Costner and Hackman, though Young is a bit too dull an actress to really put fire into the key femme role, and Alcott makes great use of the real Washington locations to bring visual authenticity to the story's setting.Jarre's score is hokey sounding and doesn't sit right with the dramatics on show, while the big reveal at the finale is still as divisive today as it was back on the film's release, but this is still a fine example of a film noir remake that really works for the neo-noir loving crowd. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A twisty-turny masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great eighties thriller that actually delivers on what it promises. Hackman, Costner, and Patton give great performances, with only Young lagging slightly -- the viewer is never entirely sure what attracted Brice to Susan in the first place. Perhaps the scene in the limo is an example of her four-sheets-to-the-wind personality. It certainly ensnared Costner.Much has been said about the last five minutes of the film. It's a great use of the "Yuri" red herring that runs throughout the film, though it doesn't necessarily add anything to the story, other than to reinforce the paranoia that no one really is who they seem, and no one can be trusted. An ideal twist is one that isn't needed to enjoy the film -- here, it's not needed but only muddies the water in terms of where sympathies lie.The one aspect of this film that truly doesn't stand up is the score. A horrible late-eighties synth soundtrack fills in where a Bernard Herrmann-esquire orchestra would have done nicely and reinforced the Hitchcockian nature of the story. Still, however, a well-done film.</fullReview>

By means of his international intelligence service experience -which is hidden in story until the ending- he's hired by a job in Pentagon to work as an assistant of National Defense minister. Through KGB connections the defence ministry gives him a top secret mission to exterminate a CIA funding operation called The Phantom Submarine, but to let the media know what's going on, his heroic rescue is being shown to cloak the facts with KGB.Though it's a remake of Yves Montand's Police Python and John Farrow's The Big Clock, this film offers couple surprises and endless suspense. Compare it with the best movies of 1987, Timothy Dalton's James Bond flick "The Living Daylights" or Charlie Sheen's "Wall Street" is not offering you anything as a surprising and twisted story. No Way Out possesses a sense of film noir from the post-modern world war-II era. For me in every aspect No Way Out comes before its comparisons if the consideration is onto plot, story, thriller, suspense.Those were the factors what makes No Way Out favoured and likable. But for professional audiences and concerns, first of all No Way Out has everything in common with the Film Noir age movies; a hero and his squeeze, he's growing suspect if she's on cheating him, suddenly she dies creating a twist in the story, hero runs after to solve the mystery of her death, as simple as that. It doesn't have an effective drama plot or no good sub-plots. The only purpose is to sell more tickets. It has all the necessities for a populist production, but doesn't reflect any messages, it doesn't tell nothing to the viewer. Things happen and we watch it with excitement, wondering what's gonna happen next, that's all. The filming and directing dexterity as a whole production is what the main problem is. No wonder why no awards for this movie.Considering Redford &amp; Dunaway's "Three Days of The Condor(1975)", I expected to see better intelligence bureau movies in 1980s and 1990s. But not until 21st century you come across another good governmental crime. After the death of the leading actress in the film, the romance segment ends off, then we're stuck in the Pentagon, watching things happening between CIA, NSA and KGB all trying to give an end to a scandal before it rises. If you're looking to find a good crime film, you're in the wrong place.I will finish up with what I liked most in No Way Out. It's a great popcorn movie, a perfect choice for having fun with family or with spouse/girlfriend. Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman together enhances the viewing quality. One of the best movies of Kevin Costner, and includes some memorable moments of him with his female cast-mate. Just for its moments of romance its better than Top Gun. Remember Top Gun was half-a-romance movie, this was even one-third in length. 1980s was the generation when all the women in the world dreamt and fantasized of MEN IN UNIFORM.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Kevin Costner thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Commander Tom Farrell (Kevin Costner) is a naval officer who is being interrogated. Six months earlier, Farrell got involved with Susan Atwell (Sean Young) without knowing that she's the mistress to the secretary of defense David Brice (Gene Hackman). He's starting a new job under Brice working with an old friend Scott Pritchard (Will Patton). Eventually Farrell finds out that Brice is the other man. A jealous Brice strikes Susan off the balcony to her death. Pritchard works to cover it up and find the other lover who is a possible witness. There is a negative to a Polaroid under the bed and Pritchard claims it as a photo of a KGB mole. Farrell is put in charge as Sam Hesselman (George Dzundza) tries to regenerate the photo.It's a terrific noir thriller. Once the movie turns into an investigation, the paranoia and the intensity ramp up multiple folds. It's like a runaway train. It's an exciting psychological thriller without the action scenes. With this, Kevin Costner is on his way to becoming the biggest star in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hot on the heels of The Untouchables, came the next Costner pic. 5 weeks to be exact. No Way Out is one of those exciting thrillers, in many a moon, if with only a slow lead up to the accidental murder of Hackman's mistress (Young), by the man himself, where a hard slap sends her over a balustrade, to her death. Naval seal officer, Tom Farrell (Costner) was making love with Young, prior, where Hackman's knock, was kind of his cue for getting the hell out of there. Hackman plays a powerful minister of defence who has his homosexual assistant, a fantastic Will Patton, do his dirty work for him, where a cover up comes into play, only Costner has been assigned to head the investigation, so he's pretty much dug himself into a grave. This situation of story structure is what makes the movie exciting, where the walls start to come closing in, and Costner feels only too obliged to really tell the other operatives about what really went down, but of course can't, for a few reasons. The car chase scene, that ends on foot was thrilling, where Costner tries to hinder some agents, who are about to uncover evidence that places Costner at the scene of the crime. It's these situations and others that make the film exciting. It's Will Patton who has to commended though, while Hackman adds slight menace. Too, we have the Q and A scenario, with Costner in too deep, defending himself, in the interrogation, which of course puts the other scenes in the before phase. Too again, I don't quite know how Hackman's fate ended. I'm pretty sure he died. I'll guess I'll have to watch this film again. I for one haven't got a problem with that. I guess my only gripe with this exciting espionage thriller, was just the little too long, start, involving the getting to know you stuff, between Costner and Young who get very cozy, as shown in that montage. This plays against the title song, where too Costner and friend live it up The Philippines, in some play/off time, amongst some dancing titties. But this much earlier screen time shared, between our lovebirds, did make her tragic death, more effective. Recommended highly, before Costner went on to make those trifle batch of three hour, bore to death flicks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched the movie a few days ago (2014), and to say the truth - I wasn't really expecting anything - I knew it is a quite early Kevin Costner/Gene Hackman movie which I haven't heard about. The acting is great, the plot is really interesting - once you start watching it, it will be really hard to pause. Maybe some parts of the movie were a bit predictable but the big twist in that movie is ABSOLUTELY AWESOME and really UNEXPECTED.If you have a chance - go watch this one on a rainy Friday night, you won't regret.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based upon the 1948 Ray Milland mystery/thriller "The Big Clock", "No Way Out" is a tense, high-octane film which centres around the pentagon in Washington D.C.Kevin Costner is Navy Commander Tom Farrell, newly recruited to the staff of Defence Secretary David Bryce (Gene Hackman), it is his job to act as liaison between that office and the intelligence community. Things really heat up when Secretary Bryce and his right-hand man attempt to cover up the death of the former's mistress. Commander Farrell's personal involvement with the woman makes things all the more complex.Roger Donaldson has delivered a suspenseful 80's thriller just the way they ought to be. Small doses of sex and violence are strengthened by some terrific, nerve racking chase sequences and a superb plot which contains enough twists and counter-twists to keep the audience well and truly entertained. Add to this the strong cast (which includes Sean Young, Will Patton and George Dzundza), professional editing and a great keyboard score from Maurice Jarre and you have yourself a very worthwhile 114 minutes.Great value for the attentive movie-goer who craves action and suspense.Saturday, April 2, 1994 - T.V.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What if Kevin Costners character really works for America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No Way Out is a cold war thriller that makes Kgb moles look ominous. I think the former Kgb is called the FSB now. I took a Canadian Forces Special Service Force Military Intelligence Course so I know about Russia and China. There is now a Brazil Russia India China South Africa alliance known as Brics for short. My advice is to not make fun of their spys and to avoid them. The film is directed by Roger Donaldson who makes the Pentagon scenes feel claustrophobic. Kevin Costner plays Tom Farrell a Navy Lieutenant Commander who has a fling with Sean Youngs character not realizing that she is the mistress of Defense Secretary David Brice played very well by Gene Hackman. Kostners character is put in charge of finding the killer of Sean Youngs character. It is rumored that the killer is a KGB mole. Farrell must hurry to find the killer because a poloroid negative of him and Youngs character found at the crime scene will be made visible again in a few hours. Imagine if President Jack Kennedy had people made American vice president for a day and the practice continued indefinitely. there would now be tens of thousands of former vice presidents that the Brics alliance would have to leave alone. I should claim to be a former American vice president so that Chinese and Russian spys would leave me alone. Costners Character knows that Hackmans character killed Youngs character as the script heads toward the twist ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the finest spy movies that emerged during the times of the Cold War. And it was indeed Kevin Costner;s finest role, until he came with the Tin Cup and of course, the Dances of the Wolves.The story is water tight. The screenplay has been excellent. There are no loose ends. Every dialog, every scene and every moment in this flick has been beautifully filmed.The story revolves around a Soviet Spy who makes it into the Pentagon. And there is a murder that connects Costner with the actual murderer. With a Soviet Spy running loose in the Pentagon,it is a race against time as to how Costner traps the murderer. The love scenes shot between Costner and Young in the car are really intense. The movie on the whole is worth watching. I saw this movie in the early 90's and its been the 3rd time that i watched it on TV and never was there a dull moment as i enjoyed it again.The best part of No Way Out is that the suspense is maintained till the last scene. Very few movies do that and i wish to mention the Shawshank Redemption and Usual Suspects as ones who have done so.I give it 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film ages well, but not nearly perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Attention AFI -- show this film at the inevitable "Kevin Costner Lifetime Achievement Award Show." In this, Costner has good writing and solid co-stars to lean on and no opportunities for voiceovers or accents. Also, if anyone should need career clips for Sean Young, they can use this film to prove that she can indeed smile. She smiles beautifully in this film. Too bad her newer films don't show her doing much of that anymore. With that said, "No Way Out" is not the greatest film and unfortunately it is a victim of real-world incidents beyond its creators' control. The fall of the Soviet Union and the end of spy-junk filmmaking makes much of "No Way Out" seem contrived. Except for a few pat references, you can not now feel the presence of the off-stage Soviet bogyman that the plot depends on for so much of the tension. The ravages of time and perestroika highlight the simple and overused plot devices employed by the writers. However, the film makes good use of classic techniques -- the battle of good and evil, where evil has the upper hand until it makes a fatal mistake. The first half of the film is used to set up stock characters: Costner's naval officer is a hero; Young's kept woman has a heart of gold; Hackman's U.S. defence minister is an amoral and calculating bureaucrat. The second half sets the plot in motion with the mistress's death. Nothing is hidden from the audience. We know who is guilty and innocent. Tension builds as the righteous power of the law, manipulated by the guilty, gets ever closer to wrongfully identifying the innocent as the culprit. Then comes the surprise ending -- the innocent is indeed guilty, but of unrelated crimes. Characters, Scooby doo-like, are unmasked as the opposite of what they appeared. The camera dollies back ... credits roll ... the house lights come up ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Way Out: A Masterpiece Spy Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No Way Out is a thriller about a U.S. Naval officer investigating a Washington, D.C. murder. It stars Kevin Costner, Gene Hackman and Sean Young. It is a remake of The Big Clock; both films are based on the novel by Kenneth Fearing.The supporting cast includes Will Patton, Howard Duff, George Dzundza, Jason Bernard, Fred Thompson and Iman.It was written by Robert Garland and directed by Roger Donaldson.While at a Washington party, Tom meets Susan Atwel, and they're soon sharing a steamy love scene in the back of a limo. Several months pass before Tom meets Susan again; he discovers she's the mistress of the US Secretary of Defense David Brice. When Susan is murdered by Brice, his loyal aide dutifully destroys the evidence and invents the fallacious theory that a KGB mole was responsible. Tom is assigned to locate that mole -- a perilous situation, since Tom knows that no such mole exists, but must go along with the charade since he was the last person who was seen with Susan.Farrell obtains the printout before the picture implicating him becomes visible and presents it to Brice, who then shifts the blame to Pritchard, arguing that Pritchard was jealous of his relationship with Susan. A devastated Pritchard commits suicide and is falsely exposed as "Yuri" to the police by Brice, hoping to escape blame for Susan's death, and Farrell, who is finally able to leave the Pentagon free of suspicion.As Farrell sits beside Susan's grave, two plainclothes men arrive and take him away for questioning. One of the interrogators is Farrell's landlord, who addresses Farrell in Russian. Farrell, who responds in kind is, in fact, the real "Yuri" and his landlord is his KGB supervisor. Yuri/Farrell was planted in the U.S. as a teenager and became the KGB's "mole" in the Department of Defense. Aware of Brice's affair, the Russians assigned Farrell to seduce the Secretary of Defense's mistress and gather intelligence from her. Although his handlers demand that he return to the Soviet Union, Farrell refuses and leaves as his handler quips, "He'll be back. Where else does he have to go?"Roger Donaldson's modern spin on No Way Out is dense and stylish.This suspense film has features of the 1940s thrillers but it was terrific and ingenious that a viewer who likes good movies would surely appreciate.In it,we get to see fine performances from stars Gene Hackman and Sean Young.Truly,it was a career-making performance for Kevin Costner as it catapulted him to stardom as he displays some charisma in a twisty, stylish espionage thriller.It was truly a masterpiece in its genre as a film in which a simple situation grows more and more complex and neither of which is contrived nor manipulated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior Pentagon Cold War spy thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a nail-biting thriller which holds up to repeated viewing, even if you know the surprise ending. The film is unaccountably said to be based on the earlier film THE BIG CLOCK (1948, see my review), but has little resemblance to it. In this film, there is a lockdown of the Pentagon and it is sealed off as a room by room search takes place for a spy, who can only be identified by outsiders who have previously set eyes on him. I was once inside the Pentagon and can tell you that it is so immense that such a search would take weeks, in my opinion, if it were even possible at all, and I really do not believe it to be remotely possible. (Many rooms in the Pentagon could never be entered by outside people for any reason, which is another point overlooked in the film.) But never mind, this is a movie, and this lockdown and search idea is taken from THE BIG CLOCK where this process takes place inside a New York office building of a magazine empire owned by the character played by Charles Laughton. The other point of contact between the two films is the central plot premise that 'the bad powerful man', in this case the Secretary of Defence, played by Gene Hackman, has accidentally murdered his mistress and tries to pin it on an aide, played by Kevin Costner. (In the other film, Ray Milland is the fall guy.) The mistress who gets murdered (which is a pity, because she was the most watchable character) in this film is brilliantly played by Sean Young, who gives the liveliest performance in the film. She exudes such significant amounts of allure that the screen is splashed with it. She has created a nervy, jumpy, character who positively revels in the atmosphere of corrupt power and glamour of the top DC folk, and sex in the Secretary of Defence's private limousine with his aide is very much the thing. Power usually goes to people's heads, but in this instance the anatomical areas of arousal are elsewhere. And as we know from Bill Clinton and Monica, those areas are the prime movers of Washington events in any case, since so many Washington heads are dead inside anyway, and only the lower organs any longer function. Fred Thompson, later a US Senator from Tennessee, plays the CIA Director in this film. Howdy y'all, always so nice to see you on screen, and do have some collard greens! One of the most amusing things about American movies is the way fantasy and reality become one continuum and it is hard to tell them apart. After all, what was Ronald Reagan if not a product of a dream factory?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Garland's scope is astounding; the film that launched Costner's career--for good reason.(9/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>20yrs ago Kiwi Director Roger Donaldson was already at the top of his game, as were a young, lean and athletic Kevin Costner, and Mace Neufeld, future uber-producer of technothrillers. Costner is therefore perfectly cast in this political melodrama/ spy thriller by Ilene Starger as Commander Tom Farrell of ONI (Office of "Naval Int", not "Navel lint"). The movie is based primarily on Kenneth Fearing's book The Big Clock, NOT the 1947 Charles Laughton film, as Leonard Maltin claims. Only the Pentagon net scene was remade from that.Writer/Producer Robert Garland's screenplay straddles an amazing scope, moving from Washington intrigue to sexy melodrama-by-way-of naval adventure and technothriller(!). Unfortunately, it's bookended by a spy molehunt for a "Yuri" in the Pentagon, so its twist ending is a strain that the rest does little to support. It's unlikely that Garland botched his screenplay adaptation of his own story; he--or Donaldson--simply didn't seed enough inconsistencies. This resulted in a seemingly ludicrous ending.A similar device was used far more successfully in The Sixth Sense(1999), where the reinterpretation was better-justified even emotionally, so audiences were intrigued and touched by their "perspective shift", rather than annoyed.Thankfully NWO features two overwhelmingly attractive leads. Neither Costner, dapper and athletic even as he dramatically bleeds into his Navy whites, nor Sean Young, all busty-gold-lame as a jaded chippy sleeping her way to the top, ever looked so good. Their scenes together ground (or is it "grind"?) the movie in considerable honesty under all the Washington decadence. They sizzle through NWO's infamous "Washington monument" scene.Costner is arguably the best he's ever been as the vulnerable naval hero perpetually embarrassed by his "exotic" lover. In fact, his character's charisma probably derails the ending. For her part, Sean Young (Blade Runner(1982)) is his match as Susan Atwell, the bitchy cynic who to her own surprise rediscovers her innocence by falling in love with him. Sadly, she's an object of lust for more than one man, and the other one kills her in a fit of jealousy.Her killer is Defence Secretary David Brice (Gene Hackman, adhering to the Hollywood aphorism that there are only two kinds of movies: ones with Gene Hackman, and ones without). Brice just happens to be Farrell's new boss at the Pentagon.The plot really takes off once it falls to Farrell, as Pentagon liaison to the CIA, to pin the murder on "Yuri", the supposed mole that Brice calls "the CIA's wet dream". For Brice, the "molehunt" conveniently steers the murder investigation away from himself."Yuri" is a thinly-veiled reference to an actual 1960s molehunt initiated by the real-life Yuri Nosenko. Since the real mole was never found, many think that it really was just "the CIA's wet dream". This deep background hints at why NWO goes so awry at the end; although Farrell's hurried call from the public phonebooths IS to his handler. This is the only seeding Garland granted us for the mole plot. The "when you passed the bag of underwear, Moscow wasn't amused" line near the end is already too late--we consider Farreell one of us, and no going back.Brice and his searingly obsessed, corrupt lackey Pritchard(Patton) cook up this bogus manhunt, blithely forcing Farrell to seize control the investigation, officially conducted by the Pentagon's Criminal Investigations Division, even as evidence points increasingly to Farrell himself. The judiciously impartial-looking Jason Bernard is pitch-perfect as the CID's Major Donovan, as he clues-in to the wild goose-chase.The screenplay successfully paints Commander Farrell as independent, apolitical, and well-liked by everyone not trying to ingratiate themselves with his boss. Unfortunately, it's this very American likability that guarantees we'll deny his possible guilt as a plant. Farrell's friends include the Pentagon's chief computer programmer, Sam Hesselman (the avuncular, rotund George Dzundza stuck in a wheelchair), whose tragic demise here is as much a viewer's bodyblow as Art Evans' was in Metro(1997). It's heartbreaking watching Sam draw the wrong conclusion about Farrell--or more accurately, about Pritchard.As Pritchard, Will Patton looms oppressively. He made a strong impression on Costner as well, who 10yrs later starred opposite him (even more confrontationally) in The Postman(1997).There are a couple of real-life ironies, though. The two goons "associated with Special Forces" whom Farrell and the movie are so distrustful of are supposed to be "Iran-Contra" hit men. This Reaganite scandal plays nicely into NWO's revisionism about a supposed Communist mole. It just succeeds too well.The other is the presence of Fred Dalton Thompson, who 20yrs later is running for President! Thompson (Hunt for Red October(1990)), past real-life Special Counsel to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence(!) ventured into acting and became an instant hit, mostly in technothrillers. He's again wryly memorable here as the CIA Director to whom Farrell addresses his bloodied evidence.While Garland took care of the storytelling CONsistencies (there's the flaw), the director's attention to the acting detail is staggering. He always uses the takes with the happiest accidents, and the most unmasked reaction-shot closeups, including when his actors blush (watch Patton fulminate), retch (Costner), and retort tetchily (his dimples virtually speak for him when Jason Bernard says "I was about to send my men").The only production element that for my money fails is the opening credits' font design. It's what passed for 1980s computer "wow", but it jarrs badly against Maurice Jarre's hauntingly eerie original score.No Way Out(1987) found a smart, sassy yet cynical 1980s tone thanks to Roger Donaldson and a certain future Tom Clancy uber-producer. Neufeld's son also stints as co-Producer with the fabulous Laura Ziskin, having negotiated partial access for shooting inside the Pentagon.It's a shame that the movie's poorly-seeded ending was allowed to throw us into denial. It forces the movie to bite off more than even this superpower plot could chew.(9/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Transplanting the plot of 1947's 'The Big Clock' from its newspaper setting to the netherworld of Washington politics was a good idea, but for all its nerve-wracking paranoia the remake isn't half as entertaining as the original. Kevin Costner (rarely out of his glistening white uniform) portrays a Pentagon naval officer assigned by the Secretary of Defense to investigate the murder of the Secretary's mistress (who was Costner's lover as well), and complications arise after the bewildered officer begins to find all the evidence pointing to himself as the primary suspect. It's all an elaborate frame-up, of course, but because the true identity of the killer is never in question the film has to rely instead on routine (and often gratuitous) doses of violence and sex to hold the viewer's interest (and bring the story up to date from its original 1947 setting). Costner plays a refreshingly fallible hero, and the government corruption sub-plot is certainly topical, but the illogical and unnecessary epilogue comes close to spoiling the rest of the film, by adding one plot twist too many to an already cluttered scenario.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the absolute best suspense / action films of all time. Story deals with naval intelligence Costner being hired by Secartary of State Hackman to act as a liaison for the Pentagon. Problem is both men are having an affair with drop dead sexy Sean Young, but niether man knows who her other lover is. In a jealous rage Hackman kills Young. To try and cover up the murder, Hackman starts a phony story about a Russian spy, orders an investigation into Young's death, and seals up all the entrances in the Pentagon. As time runs out, all the cules start to point to Costner. Will he be able to escape and prove his innocence. Riveting, sexy, and sylish. All the performances are terrific. The two stand-outs however are, Patton as Hackman's crazed assitant, and Young in what has to be the performance of career. This film will have you at the edge of your seat from start to finish and will blow you away with its shocking ending (that has to be one of the best plot twist of all time and most important it is believable.)

		<shortDescription>No Way Out-is Perfect Way In ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All out action-packed thriller showcasing what can happen when high leveled people in the government have mistresses.Kevin Costner plays a liaison to the Secretary of Defense, Gene Hackman. Problem is that they're both having affairs with the same woman, who is killed by Hackman accidentally in a rage.The real acting kudos goes to Will Patton, the gay assistant to Hackman who dreams up that a Russian spy, named Yury did the killing. Problem is that Costner had just left the house before Hackman came and committed the crime.The movie is wonderfully tense along the way as government officials look for this Yury, appearing that it is Costner, as there are two witnesses who saw them together during a weekend fling.How Costner evades capture is most exciting and the surprise ending that shows that there really was a Yury is an emotional wallop on a roller-coaster of a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot Holes But Fabulous Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the premise that makes this one - but if you haven't seen it, don't read any farther, as here thar be* * * * SPOILERS * * * *The screenwriter did the research, that much is certain, and there are inaccuracies galore, but that's movie-making. In particular, the plot hinges on the believability of how computers are used - and as per usual, things are very weak.Early on we hear how the chief programmer is going to write a routine to search a database; the entire process may take an hour, who knows. The centre 'interfaces' with the '370s' in Fort Meade - this is realistic. 370s are the workhorse IBM big iron mainframes probably in use by the NSA at the time.But when it comes to finding a Moroccan gem box in a database, our hero suddenly has to wait on a lugubrious printout. Ouch. If time had been of the essence, and it was, a simple search could have been done, and the results could have been there in a matter of minutes.Then again, if the computer whiz was actually going to insert the record in the database, he could just as easily have sent a job to a printer to get the record printed out immediately. No reason to wait in either case.Of course without the printout we don't have the story. We not only lose the story, we also lose the Hitchcock tension. This is a brilliant movie with a brilliant plot and premise, and it doesn't really matter if details are wrong as per usual when it comes to computers in films. Yes, it would have been nicer if they could have done it with realistic computer use, but it's unlikely Hollywood will ever worry about such trivial matters. Even for IT professionals the plot works because the premise is so good.This is a definite keeper. It's dated but does well, and looks even better when put up against the 'schlopp' coming out of Hollywood these days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great, suspenseful film. It does start out slow, but when it picks up, its one of the most thrilling films ever. Its also probably Kevin Costner's only credible performance. Gene Hackman is excellent, Sean Young isnt great, but she was good for her part. The score adds to the suspense in the movie as well. This is one of the few films that actually gave me chills! Surprisingly enough its directed by the usually mediocre director Roger Donaldson(Cadillac Man, Cocktail), but he got lucky with this one. The film does have its flaws, but its still superior to the crap coming out now a days. **** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Under-rated tension filled political thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an extremely under-rated film. While being a political thriller, it should really be viewed as one of the great suspense/chase thrillers of the 80's. The casting of Gene Hackman adds an elevated sense of authority to the whole movie, and he puts in his usual professional efforts as the politician who knows there could be no way out. Actually, it is Costner who ends up having no way out, having been implicated in a death, and he has to work against the clock to prove what's really going on.This is the first Costner film I had seen, and the crackling script is really brought to life by the director, who builds up an extreme sense of tension as the clock ticks away. Although some people will cite the finale as being somewhat telegraphed, it doesn't really detract from the rest of the film, which on many levels appears to be more intelligent than it actually is - a complete opposite to most movies of this genre.The film will hold your attention throughout, and the Costner character acts as a precursor to his later effort in the equally superb JFK.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot is what stands out here. The title describes it. The character is put in a "No Way Out" situation, and for the last hour the viewer gets to watch him scramble for a way out while the trap slowly closes in. It is very well done. The scenes that stand out for me are the one in which the protagonist discovers the snare he is in, and the final revelation. There are spots in which the pacing lags a bit, and 2 or 3 plot points that stretch credibility. The overall product is very strong. This was a fun one to watch.</fullReview>

Sean Young, who has a home in Sedona, Arizona, (and believes crystals can actually influence her life) was quite attractive in her very nude scene, her non-silicone enhanced breasts swaying left and right, left and right, left and right slap!;. Ok, now where was I? Oh, yes, the movie has a pace which kept me on the edge of my couch. I thought it was interesting that the writers created a crucial character that resided in a wheelchair and was treated just like a normal person (which is the way it ought to be.)

		<shortDescription>Murder, Intrigue &amp; Espionage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This excellent thriller is essentially a reworking of John Farrow's "The Big Clock" (1948) and both movies were based on Kenneth Fearing's novel of the same name. "No Way Out" is full of intrigue and surprises (even for those who are familiar with the 1948 film) and commendably does a great deal more than simply choosing to replicate its predecessor. By transferring the action from a publishing company in New York to the Pentagon (in Washington) it increases the scope for creating even more conspiracies and double dealing and in some ways also sets the stakes higher.Following an act of heroism at sea, Lieutenant Commander Tom Farrell (Kevin Costner) is transferred to Washington to undertake duties at the Office of the Secretary of Defense, David Brice (Gene Hackman). Initially, Farrell is given the task of acting as a liaison between Brice and the CIA.Farrell's aware that his lover, Susan Atwell (Sean Young) is also involved with another man and one evening when he's leaving her apartment, sees the other man (who happens to be Brice) who's just about to enter the property. Brice, having seen someone in the shadows (and not realising that it's Farrell), becomes furious with Susan and during the ensuing argument hits her and causes her to fall over a balcony to her death.Scott Pritchard (Will Patton) is an old friend of Farrell's and also Brice's loyal assistant. When his boss indicates that he's ready to admit his part in Susan's death, Pritchard tries desperately to dissuade him from taking that course of action and suggests that they should organise a cover-up and implicate someone else as the culprit.Pritchard cleans up all the surfaces in Susan's apartment which may have fingerprints on them, removes any items which could be used as evidence and then invents a story that Susan's other lover was a Soviet spy called Yuri. It had long been rumoured that there was a Russian spy in the Pentagon but no-one had ever seen him and so it was very uncertain whether he even existed.Farrell obviously knows who killed Susan and is subsequently put in charge of the investigation to find Yuri. Unfortunately, this puts him in a position where the information uncovered by his investigation is likely to point to his own guilt and he therefore has to embark on a frantic race against time to produce compelling evidence of the real killer's guilt before he finds himself condemned by the information produced by his own investigation.Kevin Costner has the right physique and clean cut looks for his part as a naval officer and he's also believable during the romantic episodes and in his interaction with colleagues at the Pentagon. However, it's during the passages where he's at his most energetic and when he feels most trapped that he really excels and it's at these times that his performance is most evocative of Ray Milland's in "The Big Clock".Gene Hackman is faultless as the politician who becomes very insecure because of the trouble he gets into as a result of his inability to control his intense levels of jealousy and anger and Sean Young is entertaining as the mysterious mistress with plenty of attitude.Will Patton provides the movie's most memorable performance as a real all-out villain who's fanatical in his loyalty to Brice and totally ruthless in taking whatever action is necessary to protect his boss."No Way Out" is a very involved story which features murder, espionage and the gross abuse of power. The action begins at a fairly leisurely pace but then very effectively continues to build until it becomes positively frenetic. Director Roger Donaldson skilfully creates a great deal of suspense and a claustrophobic atmosphere which helps to accentuate just how trapped Farrell feels. The chase sequences are very well choreographed and the plot contains some really neat twists which add enormously to the enjoyment of the piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent suspense thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NO WAY OUT is a bit of an oddity. For the first hour or so, I watched this in complete indifference, waiting for the real 'plot' to begin. Watching Costner and Young sleeping together was repetitive and pretty dated, full of '80s tunes and cheesy scenes, like the one in the back of the limousine. Then Hackman's character sets the plot off for real, and suddenly I was hooked. I was behind Costner's character all the way, and I loved the way the scriptwriter trapped him within the imprisoning confines of the Pentagon, hunting for a wronged man whom he knew to be himself. I thought the suspense and twists played out very well. Often in suspense movies, writers are happy to throw out all the old clichés ? such as the ticking bomb ? but the computer recognition software really makes this film and gives it an edge over its competition.There was a sense of urgency that I rarely find elsewhere in the movies. My heart was pounding as Costner's plight became ever more deadly and how his enemies were gradually closing in. A COMMANDO-style action set-piece in a shopping mall threatens to destroy credibility, but then the suspense comes back stronger than ever, lasting right until the thrilling ending. Then we get an extra coda, one of those big 'twist' endings that throws the whole previous film on its head. I have to say that I disliked this twist. It didn't feel real, and it felt tacked-on as a last minute thing ("oh, wouldn't that be cool?"). To be honest, I would have preferred the film without it, but there we go.A strong cast delivers a fine script in this one. It's one of Costner's best movies, and Hackman's multi-layered villain is another solid entry in the actor's career. Will Patton is delightfully evil as the slimy aide. Other good characters are George Dzundza as Costner's wheelchair-bound buddy and Marshall Bell and Chris D as a couple of hulking hit men. NO WAY OUT is one of those films that doesn't have to have shoot-outs every five minutes to be exciting ? in fact, the action scenes are few and far between, and I counted just a couple of them. No, here the urgency comes from the well-plotted situation the central character finds himself in ? and it's a rare beast to find a film so enthralling because of that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll make it short because I don't want to spoil to anyone- This movie is excellent. While the cinematography might not be that special, the plot is mind-blowing. And so are the characters. Each character is very unique and you can see it in the film- While the MC {Main character} is quite the generic-good-guy (Which is unique to the environment he's in, so it's not THAT generic), everyone else around him are special in their tone and behavior and even their looks. Now, the plot is also very good. Even amazingly good. Spoiler free- The MC is a commander in the navy who is recruited to the pentagon, and he dates the senators mistress. (No spoilers thus far. It's the beginning plot). You might think it's a weird drama flick- But hell no! It's a very engaging thriller with an amazing ending!I recommend it very much! The beginning might bore you, but it will just make the ending more amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid thriller with some excellent performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I watched No Way Out I realised that I had distant memories of having watched and enjoyed this before at some point in my youth. I hoped as it progressed it would hold up and still be as enjoyable - it was. As a thriller it is very satisfying. There are some excellent performances all around. Costner and Young were both great - although almost over the top cheesy at times. Patton and Hackman were exceptional in their sinister performances. They really made this work as at times the story line verged a little on the ridiculous side and you couldn't help but wonder at the credibility of some of the characters decisions. There are some extremely fast paced and tense action scenes such as the chase scene and the building search scene that really are edge of your seat stuff. As the film continues the pace grows and grows until it explodes into a frenetic and frenzied outcome. Just when you think it's all done and dusted the final scene reveals the biggest shock of all. Personally I did like the twist - but think that it could have been done more subtly and effectively. Overall verdict: solid 80's corruption thriller with some excellent acting that gave the story weight and made it work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kevin Costner's Best Performance So Far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continuing my plan to watch every Kevin Costner movie in order, I come to No Way Out from 1987.Plot In A Paragraph: Lt. Cdr. Tom Farrell (KC) is a naval officer assigned to newly appointed Secretary of Defense David Brice (Gene Hackman). When there is a murder, he gets caught up in a life or death situation.No Way Out is a superior thriller, that I personally think is brilliant, and I'm constantly surprised that so few people have seen it. We have seen the main character of a movie being innocent, despite all the evidence saying he is guilty a million times before. But the idea of a man running an investigation that, unless he can uncover evidence to the contrary, will lead ultimately to his own destruction is genius. The story is so tight, and the performances are so good, I found myself really caught up in the movie and really cared about the characters. That's always the sign of a great thriller, when you care about the characters. It's well directed, well acted, has some unbelievable tension (claustrophobic at times) and a couple of cool twists (including one I never seen coming when I first saw it) that constantly keep you on your toes, and the way it all comes together at the end is nothing short as brilliant. We have had a Quirky Costner (Fandango) Cowboy Costner (Silverado) and Serious Costner (The Untouchables) here we get two Costner's for the price of one!! An Action Costner and a Sexy Costner. KC's performance is a lot more complex than his previous work, and for me, it's the best performance of his career so far. I think it's perfect casting. A lot depends on his ability to convince us that he is facing some truly dangerous dilemmas and his performance is excellent.Gene Hackman (maybe Hollywood's most consistent performer) does what he does. Will Patton is brilliant, and is clearly the inspiration for Smithers and his adoration/devotion to Mr Burns in The Simpsons. We also get a good supporting performance from George Dzundza too. One of the movies flaws is the 80's electro soundtrack is a little over used. I could have easily given this movie a 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"No Way Out" is simply one of the best Kevin Costner movies I've ever seen. I believe this was where he scored his first break as a talented action star with his sexy and heart throb good looks. The cover up story is very nerve racking that you can really feel the suspense around it. The movie runs for almost 2 hours and it takes you around the Washington DC area &amp; the Pentagon and is worth watching over &amp; over again. The chronology of episodes really intensifies the viewers until the whole cover up explodes at the climax. The movie also ignites with passion, as Kevin Costner fell for the Secretary of Foreign Affair's mistress played by Sean Young. Of course, Gene Hackman, one of the all time best actors around, also played a good role as the Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Sex &amp; politics is just a hot topic of our times and in the coming November 2000 elections especially when loyalty and integrity and devotion to your job &amp; countrymen come into play. That's what this movie stirs some criticisms but not this extreme.Fast-paced, suspenseful, and exhibiting all the aspects of a classic Soviet-era spy game drama, "No Way Out" will have you poised on the edge of your seat. The story is really well done &amp; shines in the movie. The camera-work is really good, as is the music, special effects, &amp; the pacing, but the pacing is uneven at spots but generally well done. With a fine supporting role from Will Patton (who would later appear in the less successful "The Postman" with Costner) "No Way Out" keeps you on the edge of your seat from start-to-surprise end finish.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It takes quite a while to get going and the film is firmly rooted in the 80s, not just from a storyline perspective, but also in terms of its production. The only meaningful female role is poorly developed, although Young does her best with what she has and the relationship between her and Costner feels forced. The score is also dreadful. But once the main plot kicks in, this becomes an intriguing conspiracy thriller as Costner attempts to stay one step ahead of the investigation he is heading. Hackman is surprisingly low-key here, but Will Patton as his right-hand man and Costner's main antagonist is good value. It is also a film that is defined by its great ending, a scene that is surprisingly low-key in its delivery, but works extremely well in the context of the overall film. It's a shame that repeat viewings don't really offer much to reevaluate characters and plot points as a result but it still makes for a clever resolution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As political thrillers go, "No Way Out" is right up there, surprising in its lasting effectiveness. Put simply, it holds up, and if you can abide the unfortunate score, then you're in for something pretty cool. Costner proves his leading man capabilities and the whole cast is good (it even features an uncharacteristically emotive Will Patton). I guess it's a good rule of thumb that if you need a corrupt politician, you can't go wrong with Gene Hackman. Hackman's reliable in just about any role, but even more so here.Without spoiling anything, this has a really memorable ending; the kind that just sorta sneaks up behind you and punches you in the mouth. But even knowing what ultimately happens in this story, I still got caught up in the main espionage plot: Costner trying to outsmart a frameup as the walls close in; almost enough to make me forget the final twist. That says a lot about the craft behind such a movie.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw No Way Out the other night for the first time in over 20 years. It happened to be on TV and my wife, who has never seen it, and I decided to sit down and watch it after I told how good it was.For the first 15/20 minutes I wondered if I had been remembering the same film. Those first 15 minutes or so make you think that you are watching some straight to video 1980's cheap thriller. But once you get past that first wee while, it kicks in and you get swept along with it.There is the twist, and as others have suggested, it does seem a bit rushed. It's as if they didn't quite know how to end the film or ran out of time and/or money.Costner, Hackman and Young give good performances. The likes of George Dzundza and Fred Dalton Thompson give their usual solid support. Will Patton does tend to over do it slightly.Never the less, if you haven't seen it, and want a decent thriller to pass a couple of hours, you could do a lot worse than catch No Way Out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Power politics at it deadliest has Navy Lt.Cmdr Tom Farrell, Kevin Costner, get caught up in a murder that leads to the the door of the powerful and very outspoken US Secretary of Defense himself David Brice, Gene Hackman. Farrell's troubles actually started at the Inauguration Ball when he met sexy party girl Susan Atwell, Sean Young, and got involved in a hot and heavy love affair with her.Being recommended for a job in Brice's office by his chief of staff Scott Pritchard, Will Patton, as his man in between the Defense Department and the intelligence services Farrell had no idea that at that very time he was involved with his boss', Secretary Brice, mistress Susan Atwell. The affair between Farrell and Atwell is also kept hidden but some truth comes out when Brice finds out that Susan has been seeing another man over the holiday weekend and goes ape sh*t over it.Confronting Susan in her Georgetown townhouse Brice gets carried away and, in a wild and drunken confrontation, knocks her down the second floor balcony cracking Susan's skull killing her. Panic stricken Brice is about to report Susan's accident to the D.C police but Pritchard coming to his boss', the man he says that he would gladly lay down his life for, aid comes up with this strange scenario. According to Pritchards reasonings Susan was killed by the imaginary Yuri, a Soviet spy, who the CIA believes was planted insides the Pentagon by the KBG.It turns out that Farrell was on the scene when Brice showed up at Susan's townhouse and knows that he murdered her and even more striking a golden jewelry box given to Secretary Brice as a present by the Foreign Minister of Morocco was found among Susan's belongings. This box can link the Secretary of Defense to him if not as her murderer but her lover that could destroy his career in D.C politics.Tense filled thriller as Lt. Cmdr. Farrell is on the run throughout the some 17 miles of offices and corridors in the massive Pentagon as he, or the person concocted by Brice &amp; Pritchard Yuri, is hunted down by the both military and local police in Susan Atwell's murder. Knowing that it's just a matter of time before his picture, a Polaroid proof negative print that he foolishly left at Susan's home, is reconstructed by state-of-the-art photography Farrell admits to his friend, and CIA photo analyst, Sam Hesselman,George Dzundza,with Sam doing his best to keep the photo from being cleaned up and developed. In a fit of guilt Sam later confides to the psychotic, and overly protective, Pritchard about what Farrell told him about his boss David Brice having murdered Susan. This lead to Sam being blown away by a crazed Pritchard in the Pentagons empty gymnasium.Jaw-dropping ending that will leave you speechless as we get to find out what was really behind Farrell's involvement with both Susan and the Defense Department, via Secretary of Defense Brice. With an almost unbelievable scene in Secretary Brice's office in the very heart of the Pentagon as Brice tries to frame his loyal and faithful, as well as loving, assistant Scott Pritchard in Susan's murder, and how the by then almost completely out of his skull Pritchard reacted to it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this when I was twelve and home one day and thought it was brilliant. Gene Hackman can pull off any role and his portrayal as Defense Secretary David Brice really won me over! Kevin Costner was absolutely gorgeous when he was younger and isn't bad now. Sean Young looks crap these days but was really beautiful back when she was twenty-eight. Tom Farrell is a navy officer who gets posted at the pentagon and is to report to the secretary of defense David Brice. At a party one night he see's a very beautiful woman across the room. Her name is Susan Atwell and she is having an affair with the secretary. They go to her best friend's place Nina Beka, played by a thirty-two year old Iman. The scene in which they're in the limo together and are already getting their clothes off is actually quite raunchy. And Sean Young had a great body back then so she pulls it off well. During their affair he asks her numerous of times to leave the secretary but she wont. During fun and games she takes a Polaroid of him which he scrunches up and chucks under her bed. During a fight between the secretary and herself Susan is killed. The secretary devices a ploy to frame someone. The Polaroid image is found but seems to be ruined. The team in the Pentagon try to regenerate the photo. They can make out a man and they decide that he who is in the Polaroid is the killer. SO Tom has only a few hours to do something about it. Will he be framed for the murder of the woman he loves or will he escape and prove the secretary the KGB mole? Watch it and find out it's a great film! If you like Sean Young I recommend her in 1991's "A Kiss Before Dying" which I only saw only on television days after I saw "No Way Out" on television.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A low key thriller with impressive performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you think of a thriller...especially an eighties thriller you tend to think of action, drama, suspense and No Way Out has a little of all that without being so outwardly bold and brazen. Director Roger Donaldson who has done this type of film before chooses to play the roles low key with less pizazz and more drama. It's really the actors that hold your attention almost as if you were watching a great stage play. The story is not all that unique but the very surprising twist at the end makes it all the more interesting, as it's a complete and utter blow to the entire plot.No Way Out is the story of Commander Tom Farrell, a navy man with experience in Naval Intelligence and a desire to work in the Pentagon with the Secretary of Defense. Farrell has a contact on the inside, an old friend who is now the Secretary's right hand man, Scott Pritchard. Pritchard tries to introduce Farrell to the Secretary at a lavish party but the Secretary blows him off. Farrell stays at the party and meets an attractive woman who apparently is there with a married man. The two of them hit it off and end up leaving the party together and beginning a very steamy passionate affair. Secretary of Defense Brice begins to have issues with the CIA director who doesn't particularly like him. They are both fighting over how to handle the issue of "Phantom Submarines" that are undetectable by radar. Brice decides to hire a liaison to the intelligence community and comes across Farrell's name in conjunction with a heroic act of him saving one of his crew members aboard a ship. Brice brings Farrell aboard and Farrell moves to Washington and continues his affair with the woman. As it turns out the other man this woman is seeing is none other than the Secretary of Defense. Farrell and the woman continue their relationship and even go away together and when they return Brice visits his mistress and is angry about her absence. While he's slapping her around he accidentally pushes her over the staircase and she falls to her death. Brice's right hand man Pritchard swings into action determined to cover up the death for Brice. They launch a full scale investigation claiming that the man this woman was seeing was a soviet spy within the Pentagon and they must find this man. They put Farrell in charge of the investigation and all the facts are starting to point towards him as he struggles to stop them from discovering that he was her other boyfriend. Time is running out for Farrell and he realizes his only way out of this is to prove Brice's connection with this woman. Even his closest friends are turning on him and time is running out.Kevin Costner, who is one of my favorite actors, plays the young, hunky Commander quite well although it's kind of an A-Typical role for Costner. He does well with it. Same with veteran Actor Gene Hackman, who is not playing a role entirely new to him but still does a good job. One of the best roles is played by Will Patton who really is the devil's advocate behind it all. He plays both sides of the field and will do anything to protect Brice's reputation. Infamous eighties film actress Sean Young who has always annoyed me to death doesn't quite annoy me as much in this film but she still has her usual style of overact, get naked, and try to impress. The film is a small look into Washington Power and an intense cover up with an odd but shocking twist at the end of it all. It's a decent renter that won't stick with you necessarily but won't disappoint. Fans of Costner will enjoy this one. Worth watching!! 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top notch political thriller; underrated Costner at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NO WAY OUT (1987) ***1/2 Kevin Costner, Gene Hackman, Sean Young, Will Patton, Iman, George Dzundra. First rate action thriller/political imbroglio potboiler about Navy officer hero hired by the National Defense Secretary and involving murder, deceit, cold-war paranoia and some real humdinger red herrings. Catapaulted Costner's career, personified Hackman as the best antihero actor and Young made limo rides more exciting. Finely tuned screenplay inspired by film "The Big Clock" with some high octane direction by Roger Donaldson. One of the biggest surprise endings in recent cinema history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, Costner did make a good film before Thirteen Days, and it wasn't Bull Durham</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this about four times and it keeps getting better. It's based on the novel The Big Clock by Kenneth Fearing, which was previously filmed with Ray Milland. The plot premise, already present in Fearing's novel, is brilliant: a woman, the lover of a powerful man, has been killed. The powerful man appoints his own investigator to find the presumed killer (who has also been the woman's lover) before the police do. The catch is that the investigator is himself the man he is meant to be hunting. He has to stall the investigation without appearing to, while the evidence that implicates him is inexorably being piled up under his nose.In this version, a few more complications are added to the basic situation. The powerful man is David Brice, the Secretary of Defence. Brice is determined to stop the development of an expensive new submarine, and as a result the CIA and an influential senator are looking for a way to destroy him. To explain the investigation, Brice pretends that the man they are looking for is Yuri, a legendary (or mythical) Soviet sleeper in Washington.The rest of this comment contains what I refuse to call SPOILERS, because they're not intended to damage but if anything to enhance people's enjoyment of the film. However, they assume that you've already seen it.When I first watched this film, I didn't realise to what extent Brice is a relatively good guy, and Farrell a villain. Brice doesn't intend to kill or hurt Susan, though of course he was wrong to hit her. In Cold War terms, he's a dove and Marshall and Duvall (who want the building of the submarine to go ahead) are hawks. By sending the computer printout to Marshall at the end, Farrell makes it more likely that the hawks will win.That's not to say that Brice is perfect. He goes along with Pritchard's plan to murder "Yuri", but this happens while he is still in shock at Susan's death. Because we've been identifying with Farrell all along, we tend to resist seeing clearly the full extent of his treachery. At least, I did at first. So, repeated viewings of this film, at intervals of several years, have had the effect of the gradual resolution of a moral ambiguity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a quite good movie, which is unfortunately ruined by a terrible ending. Had they cut out the beginning and the ending of the movie, I would have rated this higher. Even after having just seen the first sequence of the movie I wanted it cut out, but with the ending in mind I have no doubt that it should've been left out. It's an intense, at times nail-biting, movie, but unfortunately the romance between Susan and Farrell is dragged a bit too long, and the investigation is left with too little running-time.All in all this is a movie worth a look.7/10 (8/10 if we leave out the beginning and the ending)</fullReview>

I didn't need any surprising switch, especially one that is not necessary to explain the story so far.The revelation at the end of for example "The Sixth Sense" is good. There you see something happening that helps you understand the movie you have just seen. It leaves you puzzled for a while, replaying the entire movie again in your head. Nothing like that happened at the end of "No way out".But then again, the movie's great.</fullReview>

The result is fine if you have no memory, but if you should dare to think about what you've seen, you find one huge and unacceptable flaw: The character you see acted is not the one the movie wants you to take with you when you go.It isn't so much that the big surprise isn't fun, it's that there's too much good acting before this huge surprise happens to let you accept the humongous surprise as anything but an effort to con the audience into thinking they've seen a smart movie. Alas, it isn't a smart movie, it's a pretty good movie with a stupid device.I'm reminded of the efforts to save a movie by inserting a narrator. Here it seems to me they've tried to goose up a pretty good movie by using a big surprise. It's a cheat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kevin Costner's movies are seldom mediocre. The are sometimes terrible (Waterworld) and sometimes outstanding (Dances with Wolves). This is one of his better ones. The character he portrays is a navy officer on duty at the Pentagon. When a murder takes place he becomes a suspect and it's a race against time until he uncovers the real culprit or the massive computing power at the Department of Defense reconstructs a photo that ties him to the crime.It's a well done 'whodunit' with plenty of twists in the story line, a fine cast with Costner supported by Gene Hackman, a luscious Sean Young and Will Patton. This doesn't rise to a level 10 but it's well worth watching and quite realistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a good film , and terribly illogical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Question : Did the mistresses of ministers in Washington ever get taken to a inaugural balls after the sixties were over ? ? Because that seems like the most unprofessional thing to do ever. Mix in a flimsy espionage plot , stupid scenario's wherein people are keeping things that could destroy them in plain sight and what do you get ? No way out! No way out : A terribly over budgeted , poorly written snooze fest that as a bonus shows early versions of things we would later see done much better in the Jack Ryan films only without any of the existing international aspects of it , or any good character building moments , or James Earl Jones, or Alec Baldwin/ Harrison Ford , or anything remotely exciting really. No this is actually none of that when you watch it now that the once exciting technological aspects of it are both outdated and cliché. I have heard that this picture is a remake of a film made in 1948, If that is the case it would a lot more sense in my opinion. Although some then impressive tech is featured , It is basically a string of human errors on the part of the conspirators that exposes them. And the mistress being at the inaugural ball would have been less of a issue when there was less of a focus on affairs like these form the press , and less ways it could be recorded. But in 1987 the usage of limousines to pick up your mistress seems tenfolds more decadent than it would have done in 1948 . I suggest you watch that version , because this film's depiction of Washington intrigues was outdated even then. It also perfectly explains why Sean Young's character doesn't seem to have much of a professional career ahead and moves around the Washington social circuit without being involved in politics or government. This would make sense in the forties , it does not in the late eighties ( or at least it's painful to watch now ).Costner's Naval officer is a characterless Mary Stu in every single way h doesn't have much to play with , but when he does get to be angry or something his acting style often doesn't match the style of other actors in the scene. Gene Hackman in the same year he reprises his role as Lex Luthor in the now infamous superman IV once again plays a supposed genius ( they out right have people call him that actually ) but comes across more as a emotionally unstable autistic man at times, and frankly the character just turns into a big child towards the end. It's just pathetic to watch ; his character makes such weird mistakes and takes such ridiculous risks you can't take him seriously anymore.The chemistry between Costner and Young reminds me of twilight a lot. The script was apparently filled with looks that are supposed to convey 'a silent understanding' or something like that , but it never works!Hackman is seemingly over compensating for basically every poor delivery and stale look of all scenes he isn't in and he just turns into a caricature of a good actor near the end. Also the blatantly homosexual women fearing adviser having a clear crush on Hackman's character is incredibly sickening to watch as the character progresses. You know how in Django Unchained you are intrigued by the complicated relationship between Mr.Candy and Stephen ? well its nothing like that. It's just really sad. As a whole i would call this film overrated and Arcadian.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cold War espionage, Costner, Hackman, Patton, Young, I rate it "7" of 10.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friend Paul had this video rental for a few extra days and said I might like it, so I watched. The movie runs almost 2 hours but could have been a bit more tightly edited. Caution -- contains spoilers --The movie opens with Costner being questioned in a room, and occasionally talking to a mirrored door, supposedly to someone behind it. The movie ends in that same room, and we see who is behind the door. Meantime, the actual story is one long flashback.We meet sailor Costner right before he goes back to sea for several months. He meets pretty Sean Young at a Washington party, makes advances, ends up taking her home and developing a searing love affair. At sea he saves a sailor on deck in a storm about to go overboard, and as a hero is called to Washington to assist Hackman, Secty of Defense, and Hackman's assistant, his old college friend, played by Will Patton.Back home he looks up Young, who it turns out is a "kept" woman by Hackman. Still, she and Costner carry on, all appearances are that they are in love. Then, Hackman, in a fit of rage, still not knowing who her new boyfriend is, punches Young, she falls over a railing to the floor below, through a glass-top table, and dies.They begin to look for a "fictitious" Russian spy to kill and pin the murder on. Costner knows what has happened, and has to try and bring out the truth. Chases with goons, close calls, a murder of the computer supervisor. Climax in Hackman's office, Patton shoots himself, we are led to believe that he will be blamed for Young's murder.Film ends in the mirrored room, the Russian comes out, he and Costner converse a bit in Russian, we are led to believe that his love affair with Young was part of his espionage mission, and that he in reality is a Russion spy.Pretty good suspense movie for 1987, but not my favorite genre. Costner made this one right after "American Flyer", and right before the two films that really propelled him to big star status, "Bull Durham" and "Dances With Wolves." Sean Young looks really good, and the nude scenes are brief enough to add content without being overly gratuitous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a suspense thriller with the odd burst of action (though watching Costner run, doesn't really do it for me).Confused and stupid in places. The best device in the movie - the suspenseful claustrophobia - could have been worked more. The idea of having eyewitnesses parade up and down the Pentagon to flush out a spy was wholly silly. The ending, though totally disjointed, actually elevated the film and Costner's character. Despite the film's length nothing really happens. It's brainless.Only a few scenes have stuck in my mind. Sean Young's partial nudity and the eighties synthesizer soundtrack (Maurice Jarre) were the highlights of ultimately a very dull but surprisingly watch-able film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been waiting so long to watch this movie. A few days ago, i've found this movie on CD.. it only cost RM 1(about half a dollar). Quite cheap right?? Haha...but i'm not about to talk about the price. What am I going to talk is about the quality of the movie. Actually i hate movies which contain porn...and i have to say that this movie quite boring and slow.. It doesn't mean that this is a poor movie, but it is probably one of the best thriller movie i've ever seen! Costner has never won any Oscar until in the middle of 90's where he won best actor and director in Dances With The Wolves. He has been good in his previous movie such as Untouchables and Jfk. Still he did not get any Oscar..actually he didn't has any luck. To me, he is far much more better than Brad Pitt, Keanu Reeves, Nicholas Cage, Tom Cruise and many others! I can't believe that Cruise was given best actor for Born On the 4th of July! The film is OK, but the performance from Cruise is not great..shouldn't't be given for best actor...Costner have been performing very well in every movie..and he should be gaining an Oscar in some movies..and No Way Out is one of the best example!This movie quite slow enough..and it is very boring at the first 45 minutes. Then only the it started to be fantastic and dramatic when his lover was killed accidentally by Hackman, who has always been great in his movies. And there Will Patton who has been surprisingly showed that he was a great actor as a villain! There is not much action or firing bullets in this movie. It is more basically as a thriller drama..But the plot of the movie is great, and surely there are good scripts and suspense! Overall, this is truly a great movie! Try and watch it! 10/10*** (really recommended!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure I have seen 'No Way Out' at least once before, but I didn't remember more than up to the part when Sean Young's character falls to her death... so it was a pretty big surprise that Costner's character turned out to be Ivan. Not that it made much sense with all the things (nót) leading up to this finale, nor did this twist have much impact. I'd recommend 'The Usual Suspects' if you want to see one that does pull it off.The rest of the film is a rather incoherent mix of spiced up romance, intrigue, backstabbing, action and half-assed developments - although it is fun at times just to have a laugh with (The Simpsons could have a good laugh with it - isn't that Will Patton playing Mr. Smithers here?). The acting is pretty okay, though Costner has never been nor will he ever be a favorite of mine. Then there is the showing off with neat shots of Washington (near the Pentagon - for example when Hackman's character is having breakfast with the Washington Monument behind him) and such.Not a great one, nor even a good one, but entertaining at times if not taken too seriously. 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another noir story with 80s lighting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Main assets, in my preference order, are:- the outdated blurry 80s style -- not a definite period, ugly colors, funny hairdos, cold war sci-fi...;- the cast (Kostner, Hackman, Sean Young);- the finale, adapted from The Big Clock.As with Joe Eszterhas' scripts (starting with Jagged Edge, released 1985), the storyline is a treat on first viewing. You really think it's a darn good movie. On second viewing I'd say it's pretty slow, nothing much builds up before we're getting really close to the Grand Finale. For instance the love story is only a way to delay the start and doesn't help the story to pick up. Love? Jealousy? Secret service? Cold war? Conspiracy? It's a strange mixture only made watchable by a very good cast.As for the comparison with The Big Clock let's say it falls into the general case of mismatching a noir story with a sunny pastel 80s ambiance. Basically, as with the D.O.A. remake starring Dennis Quaid, this appears to be a photography issue. Not the DP's fault. No producer would have thought of making a wide audience flick with noir-style lighting in the 80s. But the way the Grand Finale is handled is at fault too. In addition to the erratic rhythm, we can blame that one on the director. How would such a theoretically rivetingly suspenseful climax work in a setting that's not made to look labyrinthine and claustrophobic? That is the biggest flaw of the movie. Had Roger Donaldson (Australian-born, as James Farrow who directed the original) done it right he could have ended this movie on a high mark. Instead, No Way Out goes on with a uselessly dull epilogue that further cripples the movie.In my opinion, only worth watching if you're interested by some of the above. Beyond this analytical aspect it's only a very forgettable movie.</fullReview>

There are too many flaws, to many unanswered questions, too many inconsistencies... The premise in itself would have been acceptable, but everything else seems to have been inserted without any thought, without any prior research, even without common sense in my opinion. The resulting situations are sometimes even funny, bordering on the grotesque, which definitely cannot be considered as a plus for a thriller which appears to take itself seriously. And then there is the ending... (no comment)All in all, a below average movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should Be Remade as a Silent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Come to think of it, that could be said of most of Costner's films. It would constitute a major and immediate improvement. He is like an early star of Westerns, a Tom Mix or William S. Hart kind of guy, a stock hero surrounded by visual clues as to what's happening and why. His thin and reedy monotone is entirely unnecessary, especially when coupled with his inability to read lines properly.*Spoiler Alert* Not quite as bad as his over-screen narration in "Dances With Wolves," Costner's delivery is rendered nowhere as ludicrous, however, as in the final scene of this 1987 pale imitation of "The Big Clock." I think I laughed out loud when he revealed his "true" identity as a Russian. It was so totally over the top and absurd I could summon no effort at generous or willing suspension of disbelief.As others have pointed out, the chase scenes are equally implausible. I was particularly annoyed by the inclusion of a non-existent Metro stop in Georgetown, where I happened to be living at the time I first saw this film in 1988. Poetic license does not mean carte blanche when it comes to contemporary portrayal of real places or events.I would leave the musical score intact, I guess. Then it would rise to a 6 out of 10. But drop the stupid ending, please.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got done watching No Way Out a while ago and was three quarters of the way through before I realized I'd actually seen it before so I guess it didn't stay unforgettable to me, although I will say this was an extremely well done, sleek thriller with an interesting Premise. In spite of that, I didn't love it though it's tough to say exactly why. The best I can do is say that, the movie while not lacking a sense of intrigue, was at times very dull. The buildup is extremely slow, your waiting a bit to long for real tension to set in, and although it's very exciting at times it never reaches the on the edge of your seat excitement until the very end.I was, however, very impressed with the acting in this, everyone was perfectly cast, and it remained interesting enough to keep watching but I did think it was Just a bit overrated(I have heard this described as one of the best psychological thrillers of all time.)While I definitely do not think it was that, The IMDb rating of a perfect 7, is probably about right.SPOILERS:I was a bit baffled by the ending which I may never understand completely. I will say it was a great twist in a sense, but it throws a lot of things into confusion and I can see I am gonna have to go on the IMDb message board to get an accurate sense of what exactly went on because darned if I understand it. I'm glad I saw it though, this movie was definitely well acted and original, if not my favorite. And lastly, oh those 80's hairstyles....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After an exceedingly slow introduction (the real story begins after 50 minutes), this turns into a first-rate, suspenseful thriller with a standout performance by Patton (Costner isn't bad, either). But the ending is inconclusive, and the story is left curiously unfinished.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slow start but a thrilling conclusion!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening where the camera moves from the heart of Washington DC, over the Pentagon to a house in the suburbs where a navel officer is being questioned tells us that this will be a political thriller with a naval connection; once that has been established the action jumps pack six months and tells us how the officer, Lt. Cmdr. Tom Farrell, came to be there. His story starts when he goes to a Washington political event where his old acquaintance Scott Prichard introduces him to his boss; Defense Secretary David Brice. This meeting is fairly cursory but the party isn't a total disaster; he ends up leaving with a woman, Susan Atwell, and spending the night with her. They start a relationship although he knows she is involved with another man. It turns out the other man is Brice and it isn't long before Farrell is working directly for him. Farrell continues his relationship and when Brice learns that Susan is seeing another man he becomes jealous and in the scuffle that follows Susan falls over the balcony is killed. Brice is ready to go to the police but Prichard thinks he knows away around the problem; what if the 'other man' was the rumoured Soviet spy known as 'Yuri'. Farrell is brought in to head the investigation; not an easy job when he knows that ultimately he will be exposed and likely killed... he will have to find proof against the real killer first.This film opened rather slowly; setting up Farrell's relationship with Sarah and showing some Washington politics meant that the real drama that started with Sarah's death didn't begin for three quarters of an hour. Once we were into the investigation things got much better though; even though the action is fairly limited it is pretty tense. Kevin Costner does a pretty good job as Farrell although there wasn't much chemistry between him and Sean Young who played Sarah. The best performance came from Will Patton who was great as Scott Prichard; a truly unpleasant character who will stop at nothing to protect his boss. There are certain aspects of the film that seem dated and I don't mean the eighties hairdos and technology; much of the music seems like it comes from a particularly cliché TV movie... saxophone music for the fairly tame sex scenes! There is a decent twist at the end but I won't spoil it here!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Formula movie disappointing for Hackman fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is very much a formula movie. You've seen it all before. Not a bad formula, really, and one which should be done considering the corruption of people in power. Hackman plays the big shot who commits murder, and there's a goofy yes man who tries to cover it up, and of course two assassins. All been done before, so the trick is to bring some fresh ideas into it. The actors are very good, and the movie is easy to follow for the most part. A few segments are over the top. The hero has a roundabout way of trying to save one woman's life from the assassins, and not the best way to do it successfully. A lot of the plot works, but a lot of it doesn't work. This movie could have been better considering Hackman and Costner were in it. And it would rate higher if not for an extremely goofy over the top trick ending that makes you feel as though the writers were trying to be creative but failed. Decent entertainment value. A few too many poor character stereotypes cheapen the movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did anyone else notice the similarities between NO WAY OUT and the CIA-leak/Valerie Plame investigation. You have a spy, a mole, a biggie in trouble, a slimy, cocky right-hand man who will give everything to protect his boss (Patton's character Pritchard even *looks* like a thin Karl Rove). Also you have an investigation which the perp wants desperately to subvert. Also you have the ticking clock motif. Also you have animosity between different Washington cliques. Also Sean Young who gets murdered and Valerie Plame who might get murdered (it's conceivable) are tall and pretty. Is it just my imagination or was this film strangely prescient???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kinder garden Investigation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is how me and my wife felt while watching this movie. As if the nerdiest kid have got with the cover up plot, and they have decided to follow it. Actually if the whole setup was switched to the kinder garden instead of the Pentagon, whole thing would be looking much better. Only, instead of the murder, they should have to come up with something like a disappearance of a chewing gum, by the most popular kid. And to cover up, his nerdy friend had devised a master plan. Something like that. I think it would be much funnier and credible that way.Other than that, the production values are good. Actors are good as well, maybe except of Gene Hackman from whom I expected more.Ah, well, a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Put Costner firmly on the map, a bit risqué at times, but very entertaining overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Farrell (Kevin Costner) is a handsome Naval officer. At a D.C. party, he meets up with an attractive and outspoken woman, Susan (Sean Young). Skipping out on the rest of the festivities, the two have extremely close encounter in the back of a cab. Each seems smitten with the other and when Tom is sent back to active duty in the Pacific, they vow to stay connected. But, things are complicated. For one, Susan's apartment and wardrobe are paid for by a married and quite powerful politician, David Brice (Gene Hackman) in exchange for trysts at her place. From the start, Tom wants her to break things off with Brice but she finds this difficult. Tom, too, may have a few secrets up his sleeve as well, including allegations by others that he is a spy. The situation becomes very difficult when Tom rescues his fellow mates at sea, earning honors and a promotion to the Washington area and Brice gets wind that Susan may be seeing someone else. What follows next is a major crime, a cover-up, and a cover-up over that, too. Who will be left standing? This is an intriguing film which established Costner's star power, well, forever. He makes an ultra-handsome, charming, acrid, and rebellious Navy man and his opening encounter with Young is hot stuff, perhaps too much so for some viewers (it is an R-rated film, though). Young, too, is most beautiful and provocative as the gold-digging woman of convenience who demonstrates that her heart is still up for grabs. As for Hackman, he is scary beyond belief, showing the world that folks in power can get away with just about anything. Will Patton is fine in a lesser but important role. The scenery, in D.C. and the Maryland coast, is gorgeous, as are the costumes (especially Young's) and the photography. In addition, the writing is clever and suspenseful and the direction is very sure-footed and intriguing. In short, if you want to know why Costner became a major star, see this film. There is no way out from agreeing that Kevin was talented and hot, hot, hot but even if you don't care for him, the film is very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think y'all are missing the point of this movie - especially those of you who think the ending should be dropped.In the end, the questions we are left with are those of ethics and morality: if I use false or fabricated information to arrive at a true answer, am I wrong? Should I be punished? Should I not pursue the conclusion? If I fight against a cover- up, but all of my other representations are false, should I be trusted or believed in my one instance of honesty? Should I be allowed to get away with my trespasses?This movie challenges the viewer to reflect on these issues, which would not exist without the current ending.Finally, this is Kevin Costner at perhaps his most perfect, luscious moment.

		<shortDescription>Nice thriller, with a bit slow first third</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1980ies saw a number of political thrillers (in)directly related to Cold War. Most of them seem naive today and/or category B or C stars were used. No Way Out is a pleasant exception: realistic and thrilling plot (the beginning is, however, somewhat slow), great actors and a surprising end.Definitely, the best actors here are Gene Hackman and Will Patton. Kevin Costner is OK too, of course, but vicious roles played well are always more interesting to experience. Female characters look like secondary, although the running events are triggered by a woman.Recommended to those fond of race with time and find out how good an action star Kevin Costner was before his much more known, but slushy movies from the beginning of 1990ies...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK Storyline, Horrible Music, miffed ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Kevin Costner's earlier leading roles movie, "No Way Out", directed by Roger Donaldson features some fairly good acting and suspense in spots including Gene Hackman. However the movie's setup and performance by Sean Young is goofy at best. The soundtrack cutover music is nothing short of awful. Standing out in the movie is Will Patton who plays slithering and deception very well in his character. While not really an action movie, the romance between Young and Costner seems fake and inauthentic. Granted to some "high tech" 24 yr old effects and software doesn't help the movie feeling dated. (major spoiler) And if you're like me you might be scratching your head at the ending. Still there are much worse movies than "No Way Out".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lesser Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the US Secretary of Defense accidentally kills his mistress, his assistant hatches a cover-up plan. In this remake of the terrific 1948 film noir "The Big Clock," the setting is changed from a corporation to the military and the plot is expanded to reflect technological advances. The plot expansion is a bad idea, as the film tends to drag, especially in the first half. While Elsa Lanchester provided welcome comic relief in the earlier film, no such luck here. Costner is rather bland while Hackman is underused. The acting honors go to Patton, who is riveting as Hackman's devoted assistant, a man of maniacal determination.</fullReview>

Also, the guy who played Gene Hackman's assistant gives a performance that probably should have been nominated for an oscar(was it, I can't remember back that far...).

		<shortDescription>Too overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think NO WAY OUT is not an intelligent thriller because the story is too predictable and slow paced in the first part. The scenery of the Pentagon house got me nearly sick and the music was very poor too. They could have done more but perhaps all these elements weren't ready in the late 80s to be developed on a higher level or the writer and the director failed completely. I remember only some good thrillers from the 80s such as THE EYES OF THE NEEDLE or TERMINATOR. Then I think that it was far away from a clever espionage thriller. I mean I cannot consider NO WAY OUT as a timeless movie cause here you watch it once and that'a all except you like one of the actors. If you like Kevin Costner then see it but if you are looking for more suspense and thrills skip it. I recommend instead THIRTEEN DAYS from the same director and with Kevin Costner in the main role. Rating: 5/10. Too overrated.</fullReview>

The crew apparently recognized that and tried to think smart producing a stupid and unnecessary end scene, thus the 1 rank.To give more examples (here comes some spoilers): Being an IT-guy I loathe the computer rendering bit. By far the slowest job I have ever seen. They must have used a 4-bit CPU from the unused Apollo rocket. The guy controlling it is naturally a disabled overweight nerd. And of course he has to die.Kevin Costner has a white uniform and acts like one. No color here.Gene Hackman plays the bad guy and does a ditto colorless job. No surprise.

		<fullReview>For one thing, to me Costner looks like a teenaged boy trying to act like a seasoned Naval Officer. No military Officer I ever knew acted in the way he did. Also, if you know anything about the Pentagon, you know that the Security Guards really run that place. I have been to the pentagon, and every one of those guys is over 6"2", and at least 200 lbs. If you go chasing guys through the halls, they are going to put you IN the wall, and THEN ask what you're doing. I guess that's the point, though. Most people don't know what the pentagon is really like. Where were the Washington DC Metro Police? There's no way they would not have run their own investigation into the death of Sean Young. Were they just going to leave this investigation to the Secretary of Defense's office? A uniformed naval officer being chased by 2 guys in suits through the halls of the pentagon? Through Washington DC streets? And not a Metro cop in sight? Not a single Washington DC policeman in the entire movie? How did these guys ever think they were going to pull this whole "Yuri" thing off?This movie was terribly unbelievable from beginning to end. A terrible performance by Costner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Competent actors in a partly interesting plot that's been finally ruined by an unbelievable "stupid" ending!Let me give you some examples of that totally unconvincing script: A call girl (Sean Young) is driving around in the limousine of the Minister of Defence of the United States of America while having sex on the backseat with a marine officer (Kevin Costner) she met at the US President's dinner party an hour ago for the first time in her life! While driving the couple around the US Defence Minister's chauffeur thinks that this is very amusing! Sorry, but who really think that this is the way they live in Washington???? In another scene the Minister of Defence (Gene Hackman, who is the best actor) talks about top secret subjects while having his feet on the desk and holding his hand onto the telephone. Who is on the other end of the line? The Minister did not not finish his call, and he did not hung up. We don't know. Does he? Where do the witnesses, who still could recognize Farrell (Kevin Costner), suddenly disappear shortly before the climax takes off? They were a first-rate-danger for nearly 10 minutes of movie time, but then...? No explanation! Finally Farrell writes the name of one of the CIA agents on the computer print, where the golden box is listed, that obviously never had been a present from a foreign politician to Brice (Gene Hackman). What shall that piece of paper proof? It simply proofs that as soon you start thinking about the plot it turns down to dust. As somebody else stated: "No Way Out" is a boring and extremely dated movie. It is a total mystery to me that it finds so many die hard fans here on IMDb.</fullReview>

This is the era so many Republican vermin regard as their Camelot.Whether it's powerfully unerotic sex in a cab, or a jackass best friend who badly needs to be strangled (the early reels), way too many sleazy meathead moments really ruin this movie. It's actually possible to see how male standards have changed since 1987. Everything sexual goes just a step beyond what is necessary - I really didn't need to see Kevin Costners sweaty, untrimmed treasure trail descending into his unzipped pants.The soundtrack is wall to wall cut-rate, light-rock tunes.
