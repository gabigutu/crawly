		<fullReview>Let's see: what we got here is one of the best romantic-comedy/thriller scripts ever made, one of the best Hollywood directors from 50's and 60's, the more elegant and classy actress ever (Audrey Hepburn), the more elegant and classy actor ever (Cary Grant), two of the best "tough guys" from the big screen (G. Kennedy and James Coburn), one of the best comedy actors ever (Walter Matthau), and the city of Paris. Nothing could possibly go wrong, don't you think? Audrey Hepburn is Reggie Lambert, an American girl married to a swiss guy called Charles Lambert (at least that's what she thinks)... She's spending her holidays in some ski resort with her best girlfriend Sylvie and the son of hers. Reggie has decided to divorce her husband, so she gets back to Paris. Once there she found out that her husband's been killed. From this moment on she gets involved in the funniest spy plot ever.Watching Charade you'll have an smile on your face from the beginning till the very end. And you'll burst out laughing in many moments of the movie. Stanley Donen gets out of every sequence very skillfully and, as he did before in Seven Brides or Singin' In The Rain, he probes he's an outstanding filmmaker. There're two names that come into my mind every time I watch this movie: Alfred Hitchcock and Blake Edwards. In Charade, Stanley Donen merged suspense and romantic-comedy in the best possible way. Actor's selection is just perfect, the chemical between Hepburn and Grant is simply unbeatable. One more perfect couple to add to Hollywood's Couple's Hall Of Fame: side by side with Katharine Hepburn-Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn-Cary Grant (him once again!), Lauren Bacall-Humphrey Bogart... It's not easy to find two actors so compatible. What to say about George Kennedy or James Coburn? Best known for their roles in action movies, they do their best as CIA agents. And least but not less, we got Walter Matthau, one of the best comedy actors ever (I should've put Walter Matthau-Jack Lemon in my Couple's Hall Of Fame!) doing the best he can (that is a lot!) as (in principle) an American Embassy employee. So if you liked North By Northwest or Breakfast At Tiffany's, if you think that there's never been a more classy actress than Audrey Hepburn, if you do believe that Cary Grant's been one of the more talented actors ever (and one of the funniest ones)... please, don't miss Charade. You'll spend one of the times of your life. Aur Voir, Mon Amis!My Rate: 10/10 or even higher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a perfect piece of classy and classic entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be brief. This romantic comedy thriller hybrid is an absolute treat. Starring the classiest of actors in both Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn and directed with continental style and flare by the incomparable Stanley Donen, this film is not to be missed. The photography (especially noticable in the new DVD version), Henry Macini's score, the taught and crisp script, the perfect supporting cast all add up to make a perfect piece of entertainment. I agree with many of the other IMDB writers- it is criminal that this film is not respected more. It is a blueprint of what makes a movie fun. A perfect 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who buried this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw "Charade", I was convinced for the longest time this was a Hitchcock movie. Small wonder; Hitchcock all but set the standard for quality mystery films. Still, I give director Donen my sincerest apologies. Anyway, where did this film go?? Its tasteful humor, colorful characters and intelligent plot make "Charade" one of the best mystery movies ever made, but it's not well known even among classic films."Look for it. Look as hard and as fast as you can." This film ranks with "Clue", "The Name of the Rose" and "The 39 Steps" as one of the most enjoyable mysteries of all time. Makes a great dating/party movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Hitchcock Movie Hitchcock Never Made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CHARADE is the best Hitchcock movie Hitchcock never made! With romance, sophisticated comedy, and stylish suspense (including a smattering of graphic-for-its-era violence) balanced out deftly, CHARADE is the movie that made me a fan of both Peter Stone and Stanley Donen (yes, I actually saw this before I ever saw one of Donen's musicals!). Every other line is sparklingly quotable, and Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn are among my favorite screen couples; pity this was their only big screen teaming (I liked the wry way they kidded the age difference between them, too). James Coburn, George Kennedy, and Walter Matthau (all Oscar winners now!) are in top form in these early screen appearances of theirs. Both Hepburn and Paris look their sophisticated best, and the theme is my favorite by Henry Mancini next to the PINK PANTHER theme. Do try to get ahold of the marvelous Criterion Collection DVD of CHARADE; it's well worth seeking out, with nifty extras including an utterly delightful commentary track by Stanley Donen and the late Peter Stone. By the way, CHARADE is also piggybacked onto the DVD of Jonathan Demme's well-meaning but disappointing remake, THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE. On a related note, Donen's second Hitchcock spoof/homage, ARABESQUE, was released as part of a Gregory Peck boxed DVD set. I'm glad ARABESQUE is available on DVD, but I wish they'd recorded a commentary track by Donen and Sophia Loren while they're both still alive and reasonably well. But I digress...watch CHARADE today! :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Audrey fingers Cary's dimpled chin and asks, "How do you shave in there?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just one of the many marvelous moments in "Charade", one of Cary Grant's and Audrey Hepburn's best films. There's a quarter of a million dollars floating around instant-widow Hepburn but nobody can SEE IT (it's right in front of their eyes). Filled with running jokes, colorful and eccentric oddities (such as trenchcoat-wearing George Kennedy with his hook and the little guy who won't stop sneezing), funny set-pieces (like the funeral scene, and Audrey's priceless exaggerated reactions) and suspenseful sequences, not to mention Audrey and Cary looking smashing together. This is one of 50 best films ever made, as good as "Casablanca" and "My Fair Lady". In fact, I think it's better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Going Strong Past 50!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have found many films just aren't as good as I remember seeing as a kid. A wide-eyed youngster gaping at a big silver screen at the theater can be more memorable than a middle-aged guy seeing that film decades later on a small television.However, here is one film that is EVEN BETTER than I remembered it. Yeah, it's a little dated here and there, but not much, just mainly Audrey Hepburn's dialog. However, the story with all its twists is just as suspenseful and fun to watch as it was over 50 years ago. I've seen this three times in the last two years, after that long, long absence. (Tip: spend the extra money to get the Criterion DVD disc. It is the only clear, sharp copy of this film I have seen.)The story's strength lies in getting the viewer involved. One never knows whether Gary Grant is a good guy or a bad guy. The dialog between Grant and Hepburn is very entertaining as the latter tries to figure out the same thing. There are lots of good lines, particularly by Grant. That in itself makes this film fun to watch multiple times. The pacing of this story also is good; the film moves fast and spaces the action out smartly.This has to be one of the best movies ever to come out of the 1960s. I have never known anyone who didn't like this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perfection! Truly funny with the two greatest stars to light up the screen and a terrific cast of supporting players. I watch this whenever I'm down in the dumps or need cheering up. (It's on tonight on TMC; don't miss it.) And those one liners! I can't imagine any stars today who could deliver such lines as "You know what's wrong with you? Absolutely nothing." There are a zillion such lines. And I don't think Audrey Hepburn ever co-starred with anyone who she didn't click with. Sean Connery, Humphrey Bogart, Peter O'Toole, Albert Finney.You can have sexual chemistry on the screen without showing it. Today, they would have these Reggie and Brian (et al.) in bed together.A wonderful movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cary Grant ? the best Bond who never was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charade is an elegant and witty adventure. Audrey Hepburn is a UN translator whose husband is killed by a seemingly motiveless murderer. In her Paris home she is menaced by ex-soldiers James Coburn, Ned Glass and George Kennedy, fed confusing information by spy Walter Matthau and aided by the charming but elusive Cary Grant. The plot (five men who were behind enemy lines in wartime Germany stole a hoard of gold. Now four of them have come back to find the loot and the man who double-crossed them) is secondary to the suspense generated in the treasure hunt across Paris. The villains ? particularly Kennedy as a one-armed hood who literally makes sparks fly ? are genuinely menacing to poor Hepburn's sexy young widow, and trying to work out just on who's side Grant is provides much entertainment (especially as he changes identity every quarter of an hour). Charade's director Stanley Donen (former dancer and maker of musicals) easily out-Hitches Hitchcock. In its way, this was a hugely influential film. The villain with a metal hook motif was taken up again in the Moore Bond Live and Let Die, while the music and editing influenced the later Bond cycle (the film even has a pre-title teaser scene, a trait the later Bonds would make their own). The subplot, about stealing gold during wartime, provided the basis for the Clint Eastwood actioneer Kelly's Heroes and the recent George Clooney effort Three Kings. The photography, lighting and music (courtesy of Henri Mancini) are as good as ? if not better than ? anything the Bonds of the time could come up with (this is 1963, the same year as From Russia With Love). Particularly riveting is a rooftop fight between Grant and the one-armed Kennedy. This is one of the best fights in cinema history, nasty, suspenseful and with a viciousness that only the Dalton and Brosnan Bond movies have matched in the action films of recent years. When watching the film, you become aware that Grant was the model for the screen Bond. It's a pity he turned down Dr. No and never played the part, but at least here we have a taste of what his Bond might have been like. If you like comedy thrillers you won't want to miss a moment of this one. Director Donen, composer Mancini and scriptwriter Peter Stone reunited three years later for Arabesque, a suspenser with Sophia Loren and Gregory Peck in the Hepburn and Grant roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're in the mood for a clever mixture of suspense, romance, humor and some fantastic location shots, treat yourself to CHARADE. Audrey Hepburn was never more appealing than she is here--badly in need of help to discover the whereabouts of the hidden money her late husband's enemies want to find. With her life hanging in the balance, she enlists the aid of Cary Grant--but since all is not what it seems, you're in for some surprising plot twists along a very merry ride.Just relax and let Cary and Audrey do all the work--with the help of a great supporting cast including Walter Matthau, superb in a surprising supporting role. Stanley Donen keeps it all moving at a brisk pace and Henry Mancini's music is a sheer delight.Highly recommended as an expert, elegant mixture of humor and suspense, even if it does seem to imitate the Hitchcock way of filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cary and Audrey = Movie Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Audrey Hepburn fell in love and blossomed to luminous womanhood in Paris as Jo Stockton in FUNNY FACE, CHARADE -- Stanley Donen's very Hitchockian thriller complete with Saul Bass-like opening credits -- has her not only falling in love but in constant danger from some stylish baddies who are after some 250,000 dollars which her late husband stole during the war. A convoluted plot in which Cary Grant and Walter Matthau swap more identities than two schizophrenics suffering from multiple personality disorder, requiring us to look closely and keep a scoreboard, CHARADE is quite straightforward -- since everyone is after the 250,000 and Hepburn must rely on Grant for protection even if he may at times be shady, it's inevitable that a romance will develop even when things get hairy (and they do). Both Grant and Hepburn exude an irresistible charm as a couple and it's a pity they did not work together after this film because despite the constant twists and turns and identity changes in the plot, they're the ones who light up the screen on their presence alone. CHARADE was remade in 2002 as Jonathan Demme's THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE with Thandie Newton channeling Audrey every moment she was on screen in the lead role and Mark Wahlberg in the Cary Grant role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can you expect when you have two of the silver screen's most elegant players in the top billing ably backed up by first rate character players who later went on to achieve great things with their careers? A whammy of a thriller loaded with an intelligent plot, complete with twists, that keep the viewer beguiled and mesmerised without getting confused in the process.Cary Grant displays his usual debonair style and lilt to the full in this role, while Audrey Hepburn is anything but the helpless, hapless widow heroine in this golden oldie.George Kennedy, James Coburn and Walter Matthau round out an excellent cast.A memorable theme song helps further the movie's claim to fame.'Charade' treads the fine line between comedy and action deftly such that the tension of one scene is nicely relieved by an adjoining light hearted moment. Superb direction and good editing help the already talented cast achieve this without coming across as campy.'Charade' reeks with the elegance and innocence of a far simpler time, when JFK was in the White House and everything looked absolutely positive.Imagine Cary Grant's character issuing an executive memo to get all office doors in the Paris US Embassy locked during lunch time after it is discovered that one of the villains duped Audrey Hepburn's character by borrowing an office! Today, you'd probably need to undergo a full body search just to get into the embassy! Movies like this are hard to find and even rarer to have stood the test of time.See this one for its plot as well as to soak in a bygone era that is sorely missed by many.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Audrey Hepburn's husband who only married her months earlier is seen being thrown off a train in his pajamas. Turns out she didn't know a whole lot about him, mainly the fact that he had stolen a lot of money from the OSS during World War II and double-crossed his partners in the heist. Now they and the government are looking for the money from her.All that's been left to her as far as her husband's things are the contents of a Lufthansa travel bag and the rather mundane contents of said bag. It's all one big Charade for Audrey, she doesn't know who to believe. She'd like to believe Cary Grant and who wouldn't, but every time she turns around Grant's got a different character name. He has a total of four during the film. The others are James Coburn, George Kennedy, Ned Glass, and Walter Matthau.Charade boasts a fast moving plot and great location photography in both Paris and the Swiss Alps. It also has a nice musical score with a title song that was up for an Oscar that year. If the song Charade had won it would have been an unprecedented three wins in a row for the songwriting team of Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer. But the song lost to Call Me Irresponsible from Papa's Delicate Condition.It's ironic that Cary Grant at the last minute backed out of doing Sabrina because he thought the contrast in age between him and Audrey Hepburn would not be believed by the audience. Maybe so, but they do make a nice couple here and apparently he changed his mind along the way.We should be glad he did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Parisian adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Donen, the director of "Charade", was a man better known for his contribution to the musical genre. In a way, he was a natural for directing this marvelous movie of adventure and romance based in Paris, a city well known to the director. In fact, it didn't come as a surprise this is one of his best movies Mr. Donen ever directed. In fact, "Charade" has all the right elements to work as it does. First it's a thriller adventure as the beautiful Reggie is being menaced by some unsavory characters and she has no clue why are they doing that to her. Her dead husband ties her in to all the bad guys that want to get hold of a treasure she possesses, but has no idea about what could it be. When Peter enters the picture, Reggie feels protected, but then there is a doubt planted in her that makes her think twice about his intentions. In the meanwhile, Reggie has to put up with those bad guys shadowing her. "Charade" is so appealing because of the immense talented Audrey Hepburn, who was perfect for the role of Reggie. This young woman who works as a translator is one of the best things Ms. Hepburn did on the screen. The actress was a good comedienne as well as an elegant figure that graced whatever she played. Dressed by Givenchy, Audrey Hepburn is a beautiful excuse to look at. Cary Grant is seen as the man who ultimately conquers Reggie. In spite of the age difference, Mr. Grant was always a welcome addition to any film. The easy chemistry between the two stars is one of the strong points of the film. Cary Grant is perfectly suave in the film. The supporting cast was excellent. Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy, Ned Glass, among others, were perfect."Charade" offers a melodious musical score and gives the film a dimension and adds to the action. The great cinematography by Charles Lang takes in the beauty of Paris at its best. This is one of those films in which Paris seems to add to the general enjoyment one feels in watching it. "Charade" is an excellent film no matter how many times one watches it thanks to the inspired direction of Stanley Donen and the gorgeous Audrey Hepburn who is irresistible in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Charade' is an engaging suspenseful whodunit thriller. Credit goes to the writer for the clever story and the director for bringing it so brilliantly on screen. Of course, for me it was quite easy to predict who the killer was but I liked how the mystery unfolds and the locations are a charming addition. The charismatic Grant and the beautiful Hepburn form a slightly odd but funnily romantic couple. There's certainly no doubt that both are great actors and they share a very warm chemistry. Walter Matthau too is funnily (and quite suitably) awkward. The rest if the cast contribute well. 'Charade' is truly one classic thriller and even today it remains a very enjoyable film. It certainly stood the test of time and even non-classic fans will enjoy this one.</fullReview>

She also discovers that she now has a trio (James Coburn, George Kennedy) of her spouse's former colleagues following her , looking for his hidden cache of money . Regina on the run from crooks and double agents who want the loot her husband stole during WWII .This is a sparklingly sophisticated comedy/thriller/romance with Donen's stylish direction and full of plot twists and red herrings . From the opening credits by Maurice Binder to the ending entertainment and amusement is well provided . Donen is prepared to resort to all the tricks in the cinematic trade to make this a fascinating thriller . Amusing scenes as the dancing with the orange on the body, Gary Grant in the shower , along with exciting sequences as a rooftop fight between Grant and Kennedy and a nasty firing his pistol at the protagonists through a marble pillars . Due to the suspense, the stars, and the frequent plot twists, many people believe that this is an Alfred Hitchcock film . This confusion has prompted fans of the film to call it "the best Hitchcock film that Hitchcock never made". Gary Grant is amusingly enigmatic and provides the glamorous mystery element in the plot . A sympathetic Audrey Hepburn is excellent as widow involved in a sinister goings-on around death her husband, she manages to change her Givenchy's dresses at various scenes . Hepburn won prize British Academy to best actress. Glamorous and sophisticated cinematography by Charles Lang . Enjoyable score by Henry Mancini with lyric by Johnny Mandel including catching and classic musical leitmotif .The motion picture was magnificently directed by Stanley Donen who made in similar style ¨Arabesque¨ with Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren . The posterior Donen films were heavy-handed , exception of ¨Two for the road¨ again with Hepburn , and too few to show if the magic had really gone . It's remade at an inferior version by Jonathan Demme titled ¨The truth about Charlie (2002)¨ with Mark Wahlberg (Peter) and Thandie Newton (Regina) . Rating : Very good, it makes relaxing entertaining and it's a real seat-gripper .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not The Greatest of Movies, But Good For a Fun Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I prefer to think of Charade as more of a light-hearted suspense movie more concerned with romance than a hard nosed thriller. Though the film can be classified as such, the screenplay takes more time to work on the relationship between the two main characters than the average thriller does. And of course it doesn't hurt to have Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant, two wonderfully charismatic actors, as your leads. Very well written dialogue for the characters only increases the enjoyment. The film wisely focuses on them and leaves the thrills to the background. Not to say that stuff isn't well written. The idea isn't terribly enthralling, but it's executed with enough twists and turns to keep you interested, though if you're anything like me you'll see the surprises coming a mile off. That was probably the weak point of the film. It was simply too predictable. And though I loved the two main characters and I'm glad the film focused on them, I would have like to have seem just a bit more time allotted to the three bad guys. A little more sculpturing could have made them more effect heels than they were, not that they were bad. Thanks to Grant and Hepburn, and a devotion by the screenwriters to make their characters great, the film is fun to watch. The suspense is there, but not amazingly thrilling. 7.5/10* * * 1/2 / * * * *</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lessons in Sophistication by Two Peerless Masters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One can be grateful that Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn co-starred at least this one time during their illustrious careers since they were likely the two most sophisticated, urbane stars to grace the screen. Just saying their names together and the chemistry between them seems assured. They were supposed to appear together in "Roman Holiday" and "Sabrina" (according to Marc Eliot's recent biography on Grant), but in retrospect, it's probably a blessing that they waited until 1963 when both were at the peak of their abilities exuding a confidence that is deceptively casual. Stanley Donen, who had worked with both actors before, has expertly directed a supremely entertaining thriller juggling suspense with a romantic comedy sensibility.Although many consider this film derivative of Hitchcock, in particular, "North by Northwest" (also strongly recommended), I have to say that Donen sets up Grant much more convincingly as a potential villain than Hitchcock did in "Suspicion". It's also obvious that Donen adores Hepburn (consider "Funny Face" and "Two for the Road", the latter especially recommended), and in this, arguably the least of their collaborations, she is far more interesting and provocative than the usual damsel in distress. Perhaps liberated by her then-recent Holly Golightly in "Breakfast at Tiffany's", she is surprisingly forthright sexually with Grant. Much of the credit also needs to be given to screenwriter Peter Stone, who penned a clever script revolving around a young wife in Paris named Regina Lampert, whose husband is mysteriously murdered, and then is besieged by a gallery of unsavory characters, her husband's old WWII Army buddies (a Texas-twanged James Coburn and a scarifying George Kennedy among them). Providing protection, sort of speak, are a solicitous U.S. intelligence agent named Bartholomew, played with characteristic dryness by Walter Matthau, and of course, Grant, debonair as ever under various pseudonyms starting with Peter Joshua. Twists and turns abound amid the glamorous Paris settings, Hepburn's smart Givenchy clothes and several comedy set pieces like the rolling orange game in the nightclub, some steamy nuzzling in an interpreter's booth and Grant's impromptu "drip dry" shower.Even though the ending is never really in question, the journey there is quite enjoyable as it hinges on whether Grant will ever inspire Hepburn's trust and on all of the characters getting their hands on a stash of money left behind by Regina's dead husband, the form of which provides one of the more intriguing plot turns. I particularly like the climactic, much-imitated chase scenes through the Paris metro and ending on a stage with a tic-tac-toe trapdoor awaiting the fate of the villain. The Henry Mancini score certainly sustains the suspense and romance topped off by the familiar title theme. If you can get your hands on the Criterion Collection DVD, the film transfer is exceptional, and Donen and Stone provide insightful, often quite funny commentary on an alternate track. This is one classy thriller and great fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grant and Hepburn-As good as it gets!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love it and totally dug it! Charade is the kind of crime caper that exemplifies how these movies should be made. With humor, tongue and cheek, fast paced action, slick dialogue, and two irresistibly attractive leads, Charade is what Hitchcock should have made. The chemistry between Grant and Hepburn is so palpable and luscious that they become our heroes. Cary Grant was hesitant to play opposite Audrey due to their age difference, but with some revision of the script and her character's brazenness, it was made possible. Thank God!! Walter Matthau, James Coburn and George Kennedy are a fun group of supporting players. I think this film flatters both stars very well and you will discover that the matching is perfectly correct. Grant pulls it off at the seasoned age of 59 and Audrey fits perfectly with him at her beautiful age of 34.Great stuff!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great unknown movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regina Lampert's (Audrey Hepburn) husband is mysteriously killed after he sold all their belongings. She has no idea what is going on until she finds out her husband had a large amount of money she knew nothing about--and three evil men (Ned Glass, James Coburn and George Kennedy) want it and are convinced she has it. Suave Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) is on hand to help her...isn't he? Just great combo murder mystery, romance and comedy beautifully shot in Paris. The script is wonderful--always moving and full of twists and turns. Hepburn and Grant are in top form effortlessly throwing off highly charged sexual innuendos at each other. However I DID find it hard to believe that Hepburn fell in love with Grant. He's a great actor and very handsome but come on! He could be her father! It has some extreme (for its time) violence but it's VERY tame by todays standards. It carefully walks the line between mystery, humor and romance and never looses its footing. There's also a very funny funeral sequence at the beginning. This is a Hitchcock like film--hard to believe he didn't make this.The acting is very good by Hepburn and Grant and Coburn is fun. But Kennedy and Glass are just so-so and Walter Matthau is horrible. Still the focus is mostly on Hepburn and Grant so these are minor complaints.This was a hit upon release. Unfortunately the TV version is heavily edited (for example--the movie runs 114 minutes and played in 2 hour time slots on TV!). That might be why the movie is still pretty unknown even today. Stiil, well worth catching. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...is the only word that I can think of right now. I loved this movie, the plot, the characters, the actors, and all the little plot twists--I loved the witty banter between Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant especially. Charade mixes mystery, comedy, and romance with just the right amounts, and it makes for a splendidly done and thoroughly enjoyable movie. (Then again, anything with Cary Grant has got to be brilliant, in my opinion.) The ending was unexpected as well (it was a possibility for me, but I never thought it'd really be ----). Too bad they don't make them like this anymore.Please don't even get me started on that cringe-worthy remake with Mark Wahlberg. It's a total disgrace to this wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...back in the '50s and '60s. Most thrillers today are terribly contrived and cover the same ground. It's refreshing to go back and review classics, and this is one of them.Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant light up the screen as lovers caught in a web of murder and deceit when three dangerous criminals seek out a fortune stolen by Hepburn's late husband. To reveal any more would be cheating.Plenty of twists, great one-liners, and sparkling performances make this a must-see. Fans of Hitchcock won't be disappointed with the story, as it shares similarities with some of his masterpieces. A successfull blend of comedy, romance, and suspense. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Charade" seems to exist in a parallel universe, where it is not only humanly possible for a man to be as dapper, sexy and urbane as Cary Grant, and a woman to be as chic, adorable and beautiful as Audrey Hepburn, but for them to be a romantic couple, to boot (the mind reels at what the children would look and sound like). Long underrated and underappreciated (and only available in horrible-looking, grainy video prints), this fabulously entertaining comedy-thriller is the cinematic equivilant of a champagne cocktail. Often compared (perhaps unfavorably) to Hitchcock's films of the period, "Charade" contains little of the heavy psychological tension that marked Hitch's work. Instead, the film concentrates on witty banter, Audrey's wardrobe and a clever script--and we're the richer for it. Audrey is a sudden widow who is terrifyingly thrust into a web of deceit; her late husband, it seems, was being hunted by three ex-war buddies with whom he stole $250,000. Audrey, they think, has the money--and if she doesn't come up with it quickly, she'll be joining him. Cary Grant is the handsome, mysterious stranger who may be friend or foe. It had been done before, and it's been done since, but never with such panache. Henry Mancini's stylish score adds immeasurably to both the fun and the tension; and the ever-nimble Stanley Donen directs the suspense scenes just as deftly as the comic ones. My favorites: Audrey trailing Cary dressed "inconspicuously" in a white Givenchy trenchcoat and huge movie star sunglasses, while giving a poor German tourist the fits; Audrey finally cornering Cary in her hotel room and lightly kissing her way down his face--today's filmmakers might take a page from her book: this scene is intensely romantic without ever seeing a bit of exposed flesh or dueling tongues; and of course, the fabulous opening scene (I won't give away the surprise)--with Audrey wearing one of my favorite Movie Star get ups of all time: a hooded mink poncho over a catsuit. This is entertainment with a capital "E", made all the more enjoyable because it never panders to the lowest common denominator, never dips into "camp," and never breaks a sweat. Today's films continue to mine the same territory, and the results are ceaselessly boring, tawdry or both. You can FEEL the strain of the writers and actors as they attempt the kind of slick interplay that came naturally to those involved in "Charade." The beautiful, magnificently restored Criterion DVD edition now allows us to revel in this film like never before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've got the dream pairing of two of the classiest and most charming stars ever to grace the screen, a suspense thriller that IS worthy of Hitchcock, despite what other reviewers would ahve you think, a very witty script by Broadway librettist Peter Stone, some hilarious comedy, sexy romance, direction 'with flair" by Stanley Donen, a wonderful supporting cast, and music that (As in just about any Henry Mancini film score) is almost as entertaining as the film. From the psychedelic opening credits set to Mancini's Bond-esque theme music, you know "Charade"'s going to be an entertaing movie, and it is! Cary Grant is delightful and suave as ever, audrey was probably never sexier or more chic, (Though some individual "bits" of her acting are unconvincing at times, overall she is great), and Walter Matthau (In an unconventional role for him), James Coburn, George Kennedy, and Ned Glass (The one who was allergic to Hepburn's husband) couldn't be better. The two stars have delightful chemistry and a wonderful repartee going, and the funeral sequence, among others, is truly hilarious. There IS plenty of suspense, too, as you never really are sure whom to trust and who not to, and the climatic chase sequence is almost as exciting as anything Hitch ever came up with. Pardon the cliche, but they really don't make 'em like this any more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is just brilliant. The dialog is funny &amp; memorable, the plot twists are incredible, the mounting tension is delicious - just what you'd expect from Alfred Hitchcock, but somehow tempered in the capable hands of Hepburn &amp; Grant so that it isn't a frenzied sort of tension.You simply cannot go wrong by pairing Audrey Hepburn with Cary Grant. These are perhaps the two most charming, attractive &amp; likable actors this world has EVER seen, or is likely to see again. The chemistry is palpable. The supporting cast was also remarkable. The child actor who played Jean-Louis was excellent (it's the only film he's ever done!), as were the actress who played his mother, and the stamp merchant. The 'gang of four' criminals that are after the stolen loot are fantastic - Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass portray their menacing characters beautifully. If you have not seen this film, you must make it your business to do so. Buy it, don't rent it - it's that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When critics talk about a romantic affair in which a couple "lights up the screen," they might as well cite, in parenthesis, "like Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant in 'Charade.'" As another commenter has noted, this is quintessentially a Hitchcock film -- and I feel confident it would have been significantly better if Hitchcock had made it. But the romantic pairing of Hepburn and Grant transforms this otherwise commonplace thriller into something magical. There may have been better or prettier actresses than Audrey, and there may have been better (though not handsomer) actors than Cary -- but no two actors ever exuded sophistication and playfulness the way these two do, and they play off one another in this movie with extraordinary charm and electricity. It is truly a pity that they never made another movie together because it would also have been a classic. I don't believe Hepburn ever had another leading man or Grant another leading lady as perfect as these two are together. And the story is sufficiently tense and amusing to make reasonable use of the time when Hepburn and Grant aren't on the screen together. The film also brings together three later stars -- Walter Matthau, James Coburn, and George Kennedy -- as foils for Hepburn and Grant. But it is THEIR movie all the way! One can only wish that Hitchcock had been in the director's chair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is just a simple unpretentious entertainment that works brilliantly.Every one of the very talented participants is in peak form.Cary Grant as the suave romantic leading man echoes his famous Hitchcock roles. Even at age 59 he was still very handsome.Audrey Hepburn as the damsel in distress still displays her irresistible elfin charm at age 33.The romantic chemistry between these two Brits is unmistakable. Some critics have complained about the age difference between these romantic leads, but to me that's as important as the mole on Cary Grant's cheek.The supporting cast of Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy, and Ned Glass is brilliant.Likewise, the script by Peter Stone, music by Henry Mancini, and direction by Stanley Donen are top notch.I've enjoyed watching this film over and over as much as I have "Singin In The Rain". I know every scene, but once I start watching it I start smiling again, and don't want to stop.One film student among these reviews mentioned that their professor presented "Charade" as an example of film-making perfection. I agree."Charade" belongs in the AFI top 20 at worst, but was not even listed at all. The reason may be that the studio allowed the copyright to lapse. The commercial motivation of the AFI lists was to sell videos, and Universal lost their commercial motive to promote this gem of a movie.In my opinion "Charade" is Stanley Donen's masterpiece, and the very best romantic comedy thriller ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure that you've seen plenty of movies that have tried to mix different movie genres. There have been quite a few successful romantic comedies, as well as action flicks that mix in a little bit of comedy. But no movie measures up to the eclectic genre mix of 1963's Charade. Stanley Donen could have played the safe route and made a simple dramatic thriller about a woman whose husband is killed and is pursued by three men wanting the money that he left behind. But instead, he chose to successfully mix drama, romance, suspense, and comedy into a classic movie featuring two of the best actors of all time, Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. Today's actors only wish that they had the fantastic dialogue that these two throw back and forth effortlessly in this film. Sure, Grant is about 20 years older than Hepburn, and initially it's a little silly thinking about the two of them hooking up. But the movie makes the couple work, even playing upon it with the quips that the two exchange about their age gap.Grant and Hepburn are perfect in their respective roles. The movie does a great job trying to throw the viewer a loop by the constant name-changing of Grant's character; soon you begin to wonder what the heck his name is and what in the world he is up to. The movie also features a young Walter Matthau, James Coburn, and George Kennedy... yes, Leslie Nielsen's partner from the Naked Gun movies, looking a little frightening as the one-handed Herman. One of the most entertaining scenes in the movie involves Cary Grant taking a shower... fully clothed in a suit. Watching it will bring a smile to your face.One last thing: there is currently a remake of this movie called The Truth about Charlie underway starring Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton. I'm sure that plenty of things will be changed... I see that the character name of Peter Joshua that Grant's character had at the very beginning of the movie has already changed to Joshua Peters for Mark Wahlberg. While Grant and Hepburn only got to some mild smooching during the film, I'm sure that the two main characters will be hitting the sheets in the remake. While the new spin on this movie is still a few months in the future, I hope that it at least attempts to measure up to the greatness of the original.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As dark comedies go, Charade is about as entertaining as you can get and a must see. All the elements of a great thriller pass before your eyes in a little less than two hours, but you also leave (or get off the couch) with a smile and perhaps even a chuckle, instead of just the usual stretch and yawn. I mean really, how can you get better than this? Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn were perfectly cast in the elegant lead roles of "Peter Joshua" and "Reggie Lambert." Whether or not those characters were written to be particularly chic, they attained that status by association (or perhaps osmosis) as a result of being played by those two great stylish actors. Yes, there is an age difference between the two (which both Mr. Joshua and Ms. Lambert allude to several times during the movie), however, we seem to accept the building romance between them rather easily, largely due to Mr. Grant's aging, but still well received, charisma. Here, two of the most glamorous stars of the middle portion of the twentieth century...albeit from different halves...work some mild form of sexual magic on film without ever literally going to bed with one another. It works because the 'sex' in this case is the alluring mix of murder, romance, marriage all rolled together in one chaotic screenplay. The real mystery of this multi-mystery thriller lay in the question(s) (which are really presented at the very beginning of the movie...and continue to its very end) "How, where, and when will Peter Joshua (is that his real name?) and Reggie get together?" Now for the rest of the fantastic acting/directing ensemble. George Kennedy, James Coburn and Ned Glass nailed the "less than loyal mean natured old Army partners of the deceased (murdered) husband of the pretty widow who is thought to be hiding a small fortune which is really 'theirs' parts." The CIA/mystery villain of the story was played to a comic, confusing, and at times terrifying tee by Walter Matthau. And then finally you have a great, a-one, first class director in Stanley Donen (also the producer of the film), who is probably best known for making the greatest musical of them all, "Singing in the Rain." Mr. Donen's musical background can be felt throughout the picture as the laughs, surprises, editing (with Jim Clark at the editing reel) and overall pace are well choreographed in the way that a musical would have been told/shown?had this been a musical. Of course, much of this great pacing (and dialog) is due to the terrific writing skills of Peter Stone (and Marc Behm). The addition of some great musical scoring by the legendary master of '60s cocktail music himself Henry Mancini, helped to further support this heavy weight film (which garnished an Academy Award nomination for the title song -the only one for the movie by the way). So what do you get when you put all of this together?...you get a finely orchestrated thilledy or comeder (depending if you are a glass half full or empty person). Often times the movie feels like a Hitchcock film (which I am using as a complement) in the sense that it?looks like Hitchcock, feels like Hitchcock, smells like Hitchcock, tastes like Hitchcock?must be Hitchcock?or not. Perhaps it's its own thing?a musical mystery?without the music (which I know is just a mystery?but it's really too lyrical to be JUST a mystery). However you look at it, you get one hell of a fun (killer) ride. What you've missed if you haven't watched: Regina Lambert (Audrey Hepburn) is pursued by four ex (or could be 3 or 5) WW2 Army cohorts of Charles Lambert (is that HIS real name? ? her freshly murdered, but was going to divorce anyway, husband). She soon learns that Charles, her husband, stole $250,000 of the US government's money during the war and double-crossed his Army war "buddies" in the process. Everyone wants the money, but no one knows just where it is (or that is what we are led to believe). The only real clue(s) left behind by her husband are stored in a Lufthansa bag?and seem of little consequence. The story is chock full of deception, with nobody knowing just who is who. Reggie, through all of the new found truths and lies, becomes more and more vulnerable?seeking occasional comfort under the multifaceted guises of Peter (whatever his name is). All this fun and action takes place in Paris, which was adeptly filmed by master cinematographer Charles Lang and is one of those films that really makes you feel as if you are in France?not on a set made to look like France. Around every twist there is a turn?what's up is probably down?and nothing is what it appears. There's some great banter, exciting chase scenes, and a most excellent fight sequence that takes place on the roof of the American Express building between Herman Scobie (George Kennedy's nasty artificial armed character) and Peter (Joshua). Humor and intelligent action pervade until the end though as the tale continues to provide for more murders and deceit?culminating in a great game of "Who do you (really) trust?" Even the very last few minutes of the movie, after the climax, keep you (or at least Reggie) guessing. This is first rate entertainment?a combination of several genres all rolled into one. It certainly showcases the talents of all the actors, with of course the comic and dramatic timing of Mr. Grant held as a standout. But, it is much more than that. It is also a movie that you can enjoy time and time again for all of its virtues?for it is not one dimensional. So go ahead and be tricked, thrilled, and tickled for a couple of hours and come away from it ? a different person? (Is that really your name?)J. Braun</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charade is directed by Stanley Donen, written by Peter Stone and Marc Behm, and stars Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. It also features Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy, Dominique Minot, Ned Glass, and Jacques Marin. It's shot on location in Paris with Charles Lang on cinematography and Henry Mancini provides the score; where his memorable theme tune was Oscar nominated. When her husband is murdered, just prior to seeking a divorce from him, Regina Lampert (Hepburn) finds herself pursued by a number of men who seem to think she knows the location of a quarter of a million dollars in stolen loot. Of all the men who are now thrust into her life, it's the handsome Peter Joshua (Grant) who she trusts and sides with. Trouble is is that his name keeps changing and she's finding it difficult to determine who exactly are the good guys and who are the bad guys; especially as the corpses start to mount up.Pure Hollywood entertainment featuring two of its most endearing and classy performers, Charade shows how a multi genre spliced film should be made. It's rare to find a film that works on all levels, as a comedy, a thriller and a romance. But thanks to the astute direction from Donen, Charade comes up trumps whilst also oozing an elegant sheen about it. That Grant &amp; Hepburn have charisma in abundance is something of a given, but they are given a quality script to work from and a Hitchcockian plot to revel in. It has been said from some critical quarters that there is no peril in Charade, thus its reputation is not entirely lived up to. Yes we can say it's a playful movie, but it's meant to be, pretty much like North By Northwest is. Yet the peril exists, lest we forget a great rooftop fight and the last quarter of the movie as we follow our hurried protagonists thru the Parisian underground; and on to a memorable encounter at a theatre. Or what about a metal handed George Kennedy putting the pressure on, or James Coburn menacingly playing with matches? No peril my eye! There's also been the odd dissenting voice proclaiming the structure of the story to be confused. Well it's very twisty, delightfully so, but nothing to tax the brain. Everything is laid out in simple terms and all dialogue is spoken nice and crisply. All played out amongst the splendid back drop of Paris. This was the first and only time that Hepburn &amp; Grant appeared together. A crying shame, for in spite of Grant worrying about the age gap before hand (Grant 59/Hepburn 34), to the extent he requested some dialogue changes to make Regina the romantic pursuer, their chemistry sparkles and they make a very believable coupling. Coburn, Kennedy &amp; Glass are effective bad boys, while Matthau is a key presence throughout. Stylish, charming, suave and suspenseful, with an ending that's truly a pleasant surprise; both in revelation and character closure. Charade is not to be missed by anyone who likes a bit of comedy, romance and thrills in their respective movie diets. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wearing Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.This is the last movie I can recall that really worked well by employing actors in their native roles as celebrities. It works -- I think -- because there are three elements involved: take away any one and the enterprise falls below the threshold of watchability.--The story works. This is no small matter. It requires both mystery and screen sensibilities. People ascribe this mix to Hitchcock, but that's not really true. He was a cinematic master so far as blocking shots and playing with the difference between what we know and the characters do. But he never was able to center the narrative itself in a purely visual world. Here, the mystery form is reduced to the barest elements: how is the money hidden? how is the killer hidden? And these are pulled off expertly.--The celebrities work. These celebrities aren't actors in the real sense. They just act the one public character they've created. I do not think we have the equivalent today, just the sexy actress of the moment. But these two really are unique and charming personalities, constructed by their time, that we get to watch.--The tone works. The tone is one of chic Americans, exhibiting then desirable American stereotypes: intelligent banter and style. The plot is American, so are the villains (including a cowboy!), the money, even the American Express and Embassy locations. But the setting is Paris, and so are Audrey's clothes. Those costumes are like a character unto themselves, adopted into the American sphere while leaving the ridiculous out, like the hapless policemen. He is flummoxed as much by the pajamas of the bodies as the bodies themselves. More about clothes: I think it a uniquely 60's Americanization to be so extreme with the woman's wear, and so casual about the men's (with the suit-shower).This film premiered shortly after the JFK assassination. What a different world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Regina Lampert, an American woman living in Paris, returns home from a skiing trip to find that her estranged husband Charles, whom she was about to divorce, has been murdered and her flat stripped bare. Regina is contacted by an official from the American Embassy who informs her that there was much about Charles that she did not know. He was not, as she thought, Swiss, but American (although he was in possession of several forged passports). During the Second World War he served with an American army unit that was responsible for the theft of $250,000. Charles was murdered by his former comrades-in-arms whom he was attempting to cheat of their share of the loot. Regina learns that she too may be in danger from these men, who believe that Charles has entrusted the missing money to her. During her skiing trip, Regina befriended a businessman named Peter Joshua. Joshua turns up again in Paris, and offers to help her search for the money. The plot then becomes very complex, and Regina begins to doubt whether Joshua is who he says he is or whether she can trust him.Like another film from 1963, Mark Robson's 'The Prize', 'Charade' owes an obvious debt to the work of Alfred Hitchcock- not the dark, sinister Hitchcock of 'Psycho' or 'Vertigo' but the lighter Hitchcock who could blend suspense with humour in films such as 'North by Northwest' and 'To Catch a Thief' (both of which also starred Cary Grant). The atmosphere of 'Charade' is surprisingly light-hearted for a film which has as its themes murder and robbery. This impression of light-heartedness is achieved in several ways. There is the casting of the two leading roles, Audrey Hepburn as Regina and Cary Grant as Joshua. The film-makers of the fifties and early sixties seemed to love casting Hepburn alongside leading men who were not only older than her but old enough to be her father. This did not always succeed (I have never regarded either the casting of Henry Fonda in 'War and Peace' or that of Fred Astaire in 'Funny Face' as inspired decisions), but sometimes the chemistry worked, as with Humphrey Bogart in 'Sabrina' or here with Grant. Despite her doubts about his trustworthiness, Regina finds herself falling in love with Joshua, and there is plenty of playful, bantering flirtatiousness between them, helped by a witty script. Hepburn is as captivating as she always was, and Grant, despite some greying hair, is surprisingly handsome and youthful for a man only a few months short of his sixtieth birthday. Besides the verbal humour, the film also makes good use of visual humour, starting with the opening scene where Regina seems to be menaced by a gunman before we discover that it is only a child with a water-pistol. There are also some attractive, if conventionally touristic, shots of Parisian scenes. ('The Prize' makes equally effective use of shots of Stockholm).Although there are many good things about this film, I was rather surprised to see it so high up in your list of top films. (In my view it is far from being Audrey Hepburn's best film, but it is the one that your voters seem to esteem most highly; indeed, of her others only 'Roman Holiday' makes the top 250). 'Charade' may be influenced by Hitchcock, but it falls some way short of genuine Hitchcock, at least when he was at his best. Even in films that have lighter moments, Hitch was always able to conjure up a genuine sense of fear and danger. Stanley Donen never quite succeeded in doing this; there is, for example, no equivalent of the famous scene with the crop-dusting plane in 'North by Northwest' or even of the car on the bridge in 'The Prize'. The scene with the water-pistol is about as close as Donen gets to genuine tension. Seen as a light romantic comedy 'Charade' is excellent; seen as a thriller it seems to lack a dimension when compared to truly first-rate thrillers. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I started out thinking that this was just too much of a takeoff on the classic Hitchcock style, but as it progressed, I became completely wrapped up in the combination of suspense, mystery, and classic comedy.It did start as almost a steal from Hitchcock with the innocent woman (Audrey Hepburn) caught up with crooks, (such as James Coburn and George Kennedy each at his most formidable) the CIA, and a mysterious attentive male in the person of Cary Grant.. one had to think of Hitchcock. But the comedy has more of a screwball edge to it than Hitchcock ever allowed in his films.Highly recommended for pure fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its very clever. And this is how you can combine action, suspense and comedy and do it right. The story is really tight... and it does invite second and third viewings if you can appreciate how the writers drop the setups and where they pay them off. Has underlying themes of greed, and the way the government can create "expedient persuasion" for their own ends.The funniest line for me was "He was just pretending to be dead, only he was dead I saw his body..." see this and you'll know what I mean --- the puppet show scene. Very clever dialogue. The beginning has more of this kind of dialogue that's said staccato fashion which gives it (part of the movie) a style of its own.It all comes to a head during the final chase and when the twist is finally revealed. Henry Mancini's score is decent, but there's that scene in the rooftop where I felt it was used too blatantly.Mathau is the best performer here as far as I'm concerned. Hepburn is gorgeous and cute... Cary Grant is suave... and even more so than in North By Northwest.Grade A+</fullReview>

The groovy titles were done by the same artist who did the 60s Bond titles. The 60s were really a pinnacle of the spy genre and CHARADE doesn't disappoint.</fullReview>

We watch everything in Audrey's life starts falling apart and she learns she can't trust anyone. Well, who couldn't trust Cary Grant? Well she wants to, but keeps a watchful eye out just in case. The locations, the music(Mancini), the fashions(Audrey was always wearing something great) and that top notch cast(Walter Matthau, George Kennedy, James Coburn) makes this film one of the best.

		<shortDescription>Delightful light comedy mystery with good chemistry by stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charade is an audience delightful film. A comedy caper. And a modest classic. Real rating = 7.7 (= maybe one of the 10 best films of 1963)It really relies on a great storyline, script and sense of humor mostly with terrific twists. However, it is quite a goofy plot in many ways as Reggie (Audrey Hepburn) doesn't know her husband and falls in love with a liar and suspected killer. Shouldn't she stay clear? No! Danger is about and Reggie loves to stay in the middle. There are tons of twists, half of which is created by Cary Grant's nameless character. He's not the Man with No Name, but rather than Man with a Hundred Names. Despite the twists and Cary's changing names, it's as predictable as Cary's character answer to Audrey's "Is there a Mrs..." Cary: "divorced". So predictably: girl meets boy, the chase, the mystery solved, etc. It runs as smooth as a brand new Mercedes and Cary and Audrey had great chemistry. The audience can get enamored by Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn but it reality, it's one of their weaker performances. It doesn't showcase their talent but relies on their cliché, not much acting but more like (director:) Cary, you are supposed to be know for this, so do that. Same for Audrey. It is largely a star vehicle like Houseboat was for Cary Grant and Sophia Loren. The acting was quite mediocre. George Kennedy and James Coburn were even worst. However, the supporting casts including Jacques Marin ("Three men were killed in their pajamas") and Ned Glass was funnier and better fits. Although this film is compared to Hitchcock, it rather is much more limited in director's artistic skills. Scenes are limited and routine, cinematography is plain (but I love the opening). It lacks the spectacular Hitchcock camera-work and scenes like Vertigo, Rear Window or North by Northwest. Still the lively pace, writing, suspense and twists keep moviegoers on their toes.Although it falls short on merit, Charade might be one of the 60s most entertaining tangled comedy-mysteries.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely a fun watch. There are a lot of twists and turns that hold you to your seat and make you wonder what exactly is going on ? and who is really who. It is basically a comedy mystery-thriller with a good mix of stars; suspenseful, with some comic dialogue and interludes. There is a reasonably good resolution at the end. That being said, it just goes on ? for me anyway ? a little too long. The meandering relationship between Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn does become strained and repetitive. Some scenes could have been shortened or simply edited out ? like that overly long boat ride on the Seine that was suppose to be romantic, but dissolved to schmaltzy. The pace of this movie was too uneven for me to give it a stronger rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most entertaining movies of all time, and I know I'm not the first (or last) to say so. Hailing from the days when Hollywood knew how to make light, sophisticated, thoroughly artificial entertainment. (When modern Hollywood tries, the results generally thud.) This movie has nothing to do with "reality" as we understand it; it's a playground for adults. Audrey Hepburn, as usual, wears faultless Givenchy clothes (on a translator's salary?) and tosses off endless Parisian-style bon mots without the slightest effort (everyone's favorite has got to be her summary of "what's wrong with" Cary Grant.) When her life is put in danger, she is just as intense as she was in the thriller "Wait Until Dark", but without losing her sense of humor. (After an unsettling sadistic scene where James Coburn corners her in a telephone booth and tortures her with lighted matches, she's discovered by Grant, who asks, "What are you doing in here?" "I'm having a nervous breakdown," she growls.) In fact, this movie may be unparalleled in its balancing of comedy and suspense. I find that those who condescend to this type of filmmaking as "irrelevant" or "unimportant" don't understand how hard it is to come up with truly entertaining fluff. When in recent years has there been a comparable example?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CHARADE would be a movie-lover's treasure for no other reason than it gave Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn their only on-screen pairing. Were there ever two film stars easier to look at than Grant and Hepburn, who epitomized elegance, glamour and sophistication over two generations? Despite their 25 year age difference, their on-screen chemistry is like watching cotton candy being spun out of the air. "You know what's wrong with you?" a querulous Hepburn demands of Grant after a trying evening out. "No, what?" out-of-sorts Grant replies. Hepburn leans over to him with her liquid doe eyes and dreamily intones, "Nothing." That triple entendre, meltingly spoken by Hepburn, delights as a moment of cinematic perfection. Another is Walter Matthau's impeccable comic timing as he corrects Hepburn's mistakenly calling the CIA the "CIO." It's worth waiting for.But the stars, gorgeous and witty as they are (check out Hepburn's hilarious final line of the film) are not the only element that makes CHARADE sparkle. The script shines as much as the acting and the direction. The film is unashamedly full of Hitchcock touches (why apologize for borrowing from the best?) yet never feels derivative. The clever original story by Peter Stone and Marc Behm, and fine pacing by director Stanley Donen keeps the audience guessing through the many twists and turns that lead to Hepburn's climactic discovery of Grant's true identity--the "charade" of the title.My only quibble would be the shower scene--perhaps taking the borrowings from Hitchcock into parody. It feels unnecessary and slows down the story. Seeing Cary Grant embarrass himself in this way with his effeminate gestures as he washes in his "drip-dry" suit jars the viewer temporarily right out of the picture. And the trio of heavies that dominate the first 2/3rds of the film, played by James Coburn, Ned Glass, and George Kennedy, seem to be working too hard to be frightening when no one seems particularly scared of them. Hepburn's panic only begins to register when she confronts Grant at the end. Hepburn saved her intense terror for WAIT UNTIL DARK five years later, so why not let these villains lighten up a little and get into the spirit of the fun? These are minor distractions. With its effervescent score by Henry Mancini, gorgeous wardrobe by Givenchy for Miss Hepburn, and shimmering photography in Paris and Swiss locations by Charles B. Lang, CHARADE is the assured work of old pros, supremely confident movie makers who set out to entertain and did so while barely missing a beat. Even The Master himself was charmed. Hitchcock wanted Grant and Hepburn for the lead roles in THE BIRDS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Charade" is a terrific mystery/light romantic comedy. A first rate cast brings it all off with style, grace and humor. Cary Grant is fantastic as the enigmatic Peter Joshua, giving his customary stylish grace to his performance. Audrey Hepburn is her usual lovely self as the endangered widow being stalked by unknown men who think she has a treasure that her husband and his squad members from WW II captured and hid. Walter Matthau is the helpful U S Government agent who turns out to be the bad guy. James Coburn is excellent as Tex, George Kennedy and Ned Glass are also in on the caper. As the treasure hunters are killed one by one, the audience tries to guess along with the characters. Who has the loot? who is what they seem and who is putting up a front? Will Cary and Audrey resist each others' charms, or will they get together? This movie is a great example of the all-star caper movies of the late '50's and '60's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expertly packaged Hitchcock imitation - a really satisfying and watchable movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1963 was a good year for Hitchcock imitations, what with the superb The Prize and the delightful Charade. In Charade, it is the turn of great musical director Stanley Donen to show that there's more to his talent than song-and-dance routines and Gene Kelly getting rained on. A surprisingly sinister film, which expertly releases the tension with moments of charm and wit before reapplying it with a vengeance, Charade is engrossing from beginning to end. It is ludicrous, of course, with so many outrageous twists that in the wrong hands it would have looked somewhat absurd. But with Donen at the helm, and a cast of sublime actors, its improbabilities can be forgiven with ease.Unhappily married Parisian beauty Reggie Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) is contemplating divorcing her husband when she learns that she will not have to bother doing so. Poor old Charles Lampert was murdered on a train while she was away on vacation in Switzerland. Reggie also learns that her late husband was involved in the theft of $250,000 worth of gold during WWII from the American army payroll. It seems that he may have been murdered by one of his gold-snatching accomplices, perhaps someone keen to increase his share by reducing the number of shareholders? Amongst the suspects are one-armed thug Scobie (George Kennedy), sneaky Gideon (Ned Glass) and the vicious Tex (James Coburn). The three hoods, all participants in the afore-mentioned gold heist, decide that Reggie must know where her husband hid the fortune.... so they terrorise her, hoping to intimidate her into revealing its whereabouts. Bewildered and frightened, Reggie's only hope is that a suave stranger (Cary Grant) can protect her.... but is he really her knight in shining armour, or just another killer trying to claim the stolen loot?Charade moves with breathless speed from one scene to the next, rarely pausing long enough for one to notice how far-fetched it all is. The dialogue between Grant and Hepburn is superbly written and just as superbly delivered, with some priceless and very quotable lines. Henry Mancini's score is perfect throughout, with a lovely bounciness in the picture-postcard scenes around Paris, but a sense of heightened tension during the suspense sequences. The revelations are concealed well, with the truth about who is who and what is what kept well disguised until the very end. On the whole, Charade is splendid entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Suspense Film - But I Would Have So Wanted to Change the Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually recall seeing CHARADE when if first the movie houses in 1963, and it has remained a fond memory ever since - one of the examples of a clever plot with a good cast and a surprisingly adroit director. Stanley Donen is best recalled for his work in the late 1940s and early 1950s on several of the best MGM musicals (usually working with Gene Kelly). But it is an interesting surprise that in the 1960s he did two thrillers (CHARADE and ARABESQUE) which were very well done indeed. CHARADE is about Reggie Lambert, a woman about to get divorced from her American husband. But before the divorce can get underway she learns her husband has been brutally murdered (we see his body thrown off a train). Soon she meets Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) who starts befriending, even romancing her - but their relationship is twisted when it turns out his name is not Peter Joshua but Alexander Dial, the brother of a man who was killed in a suspicious incident during World War II, where a fortune in gold was lost. Although the Germans apparently were responsible, the suspicion was that the men guarding the gold hid it, to divide it up later on. These men are James Coburn, George Kennedy, Ned Glass, a dead soldier named Carson Dial, and the deceased husband of Hepburn. The three living ex-G.I.s are in Paris - they had apparently tracked down Hepburn's husband, and one of them may have killed him. But each denies this, and suspicion is also on Grant (supposedly for the share of his dead sibling), and Hepburn. To add to the tensions, Hepburn is contacted by a Mr. Hamilton Bartholemew of the U.S. Embassy in Paris (Walter Matthau) who explains that the U.S. Government is interested in recovering the stolen gold.There are several mysteries in CHARADE: what happened to the fortune in gold; what is the game that Grant is playing (is he friend or foe to Hepburn); and who is bumping off the various ex-G.I.s. For as the film passes first one then the other is killed off. As these problems are wrapped up we reach the conclusion, a scary showdown in the empty Paris Opera House.Photographed in Paris, the film is also an able visual valentine to the great city. Only another Hepburn film, FUNNY FACE, shows as many romantic sites (a third one, HOW TO STEAL A MILLION, comes close too). It sort of fits the mood, with Grant romancing Hepburn in the great city.If you want to be totally surprised, I advise not reading beyond this point of this review. But if you want a personal observation read on:SPOILER COMING UP:All his career Cary Grant wanted to play a villainous part. He was always the hero (his roles in NONE BUT THE LONELY HEART and MR. LUCKY and SUSPICION were the closest to villains he played). This film was his last chance, and it would have been curious if he had played it as such. Oddly enough, the actual chief villain in the plot, Walter Matthau (as Carson Dial, pretending to be Mr. Bartholemew) was also at a crossroads. Most of Matthau's early film parts were villainous, such as the whip-happy tavern owner in THE KENTUCKIAN. However he had shown signs of being a "good guy". In A FACE IN THE CROWD, as a television executive, he tells off a scheming, collapsing, Andy Griffith that he'll be lucky in a year or two to be recalled as a has-been. And in ONIONHEAD, he was a good natured cook on a naval craft who befriends Griffith. Still his most recent performances were mostly villainous - as when he was the government adviser in FAILSAFE who recommends the accidental launching of an attack of Russia be followed up by a full scale sneak attack. I might add, to Matthau's later success, he demonstrated where he could his great sense of timing and humor.It has often struck me that if Donan and Grant had gotten together, rather than a routine romantic adventurer for Grant he should have been the killer and villain, and been the threat to Hepburn at the conclusion - that Matthau would have been great fumbling his way to rescuing her. There need not have been a romance between Matthau and Hepburn, but he could have saved her. After all, she had started the film married to a man with a secret about a government theft, and if she fell for a killer (as Grant would have been) it would have been consistent with her being a poor judge of character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starring Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant, 'Charade' is one of the best-known mystery-drama-romance films of the 1960s. If you enjoyed 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' and 'North By Northwest', this film is similar and probably just as enjoyable. You know the plot. Girl is caught up in problems concerning her fortune and boy falls in love with her and must help her, but she does not know who to trust. And, this time, it all takes place in Paris, city of romance and love.'Charade' is a charming film with humor and with an excellent showdown scene at the end involving the Paris metro, hiding between columns in a secluded Parisan street, and a dark and empty theatre/basement under the stage. Highly enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once more the hackneyed cliché of "They don't make it like this anymore" came to my mind, when Charade was replayed on HBO Asia lately. Even knowing the story and the final resolution after maybe the 10th time seeing it, it is still pure pleasure to watch such true super stars in the league of Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn or Walter Matthau. It all fits so seamlessly and is played out so masterfully without visible efforts. It is a perfect study, of what a superb actor Cary Grant really was and still how much he would let his co-actors shine just as well. Oh, what about the story ? Nothing to important, stolen money, a band of rather strange brothers chasing it and above all, romancing and chasing as well, Grant and Hepburn as reluctant lovers. Such movies do not get old, they just sparkle more over time like great vine years. 9/10 (10 is a once in a lifetime vote).</fullReview>

It's so well done, that it is a family film in the best sense, one with edge and interest that can thoroughly entertain every age group of the family.

		<fullReview>Charade is one of the better movies I have ever seen. It has an excellent suspense plot, great romance played by Audrey and Cary Grant, crisp and witty dialogs, excellent background music and simply superb finish.The plot revolves around Regina Lampert (Audrey), widow of a recently deceased American Charles Lampert, who is killed on a train and has supposedly left behind a fortune of a quarter million dollars. Only trouble is, no one seems to find the money. Regina is chased by 3 thugs; add in the mix the mysterious Peter Joshua/Alexander Dyle/Adam Canfield/Brain Cruikshank (Cary Grant), who seems to change his names like everyday clothes, but is still enchanting enough to gain trust from Regina. The money supposedly belongs to the CIA (and not the CIO...ha ha!) and Mr. Barthalomew wants to recover it for the American government. Needless to say, he wants that money as badly as the thug gang and the mysterious Peter Joshua.The story has great twists in the plot and the on suspense rating, it is at least 9 of 10. The motives of Peter Joshua are very suspect throughout the movie and the end is pure Hitchcock style double somersault.OK, now the great bits. This is the only movie to pair Audrey and Cary Grant, 2 of the most beloved and captivating leads together. Though Grant is 25 years older than Audrey, their romance is not only believable, it is electric!! Audrey has a successful stint of acting opposite men much older than her and this is the best example. Crisp dialog, excellent situational comedy embedded within a great suspect plot and Audrey's enchanting innocence paired with Grant's urbane sophisticated connivery adds a great flair to this movie. This movie can also pass as one of the best classic comedies. Though the movie is a suspense, it is not a thriller. Your heart won't race at incredible pace with anxiety keeping you on the edge throughout. Instead, you can only sit back and enjoy a great romance on the backdrops of a worthy suspense story. A full 10 points to Audrey and Carey as one of the best romantic couples of all time.This movie has the taste of a cultured wine. At no point does it touch vulgarity even once. Even when Audrey asks Grant to use her shower (which would arouse too many amorous hormones in todays cinema), the scene is turned tastefully into one of the best comic sequences of the movie. According to me, this movie demonstrates clearly Audrey has an incredible sex appeal...maybe the best of all time...and she has done it without a single vulgar gesture. Todays female leads need to take some lessons! Finally, "Truth about Charlie" is the recent remake of this movie. Frankly, it was not as bad as I expected...but it comes nowhere close to this original gem. I highly recommend this movie to everyone and dare them not to love Audrey and Cary Grant after viewing it. One important hint: You can have both the movies in one single DVD. Get the DVD of "Truth about Charlie" and be delighted to find Charade on the other side!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Check disbelief at the door for one of the sexiest spy (agent!) thrillers ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon returning to Paris from a ski vacation, Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) finds herself newly widowed, and Charlie, the husband she never really knew, hiding a secret from her the darkness and magnitude of which she never could have fathomed. With information provided by Hamilton Bartholomew (Walter Matthau) of the American Embassy, Reggie's hunt for that elusive quarter of a million dollars begins... with the dubious help of the man she meets (and instinctively trusts) in the mountains, Peter Joshua (Cary Grant), and the dogged pursuit of Charlie's partners in crime who want a cut of the money, Tex (James Coburn), Scobie (George Kennedy), and Gideon (Ned Glass). The illicit deal made in the past between Charlie and his army buddies tangles with the present as, one after another, the people after the money keep coming up empty-handed... and dead. Can Reggie's one friend, the man whose name she can never be sure of, be trusted? Or, in the end, is he the one who is ruthlessly eliminating everyone until there's no one else to share the money with? Speaking of which, where *is* the money that Charlie was killed for? Are they all hunting for something that just can't be found?You'll have to find these answers--and such answers they are!--by watching CHARADE yourself. What a treat you'll be letting yourself in for... this in spite of the fact that the film starts out a little slowly, and never quite dispels the feeling that everything one sees and hears as part of the audience is all too well-manufactured. A lot of the banter between Reggie and Peter, for example, seems just a little *too* glib; all the coincidences and plot twists (though they make for simply marvellous movie-watching!) just this side of too perfect. It all fits perfectly during the film, but you do come away from it wondering if you--and Reggie!--have been cheated just once too many times. However, that's just about the only caveat one can find about the extent to which you'll enjoy watching this film. Quite frankly, leave disbelief behind and you'll find yourself just enjoying the ride. Revel in the dialogue (crisp and stylish in the best tradition of romantic comedy), the settings (it's a nice picture of Paris, the ideal backdrop for high espionage and deep romance), and the cleverness of the script. The plot really is quite exceptional, though a bit contrived, and some of the twists--for there are several!--really leave you gasping. If for nothing else, this film is as good as any to serve as an introduction to Cary Grant. He's suave, just a little bit roguish, smiles that heartbreaking smile and tosses off those lines so naturally you'd wish he *had* become the original (James) Bond. From the absolutely priceless orange-game scene, through to his shower fully-clothed for Reggie's sake, Grant displays that impeccable and under-rated comedic timing he was born with... just as he shows his talent for darker drama (mined so successfully by Hitchcock in NOTORIOUS, another top-notch spy thriller) in the final scenes of this film. Audrey Hepburn, as usual, has that innate ability to make the audience fall in love with her over the course of a film--I must say that I hadn't warmed to her at first, thinking her too detached for the film. I don't mean her character, who is *meant* to be a little 'nuts' and detachedly asks for food (repeatedly!) and cigarettes every time she's faced with another stunning revelation. Hepburn herself seemed a bit removed from the action going on in the film, a little oblivious to the other actors around her. Fortunately this sense of distancing didn't last too long--by the time Reggie and Peter stared into each other's eyes while passing oranges under their chins (it's a lot sexier than it sounds, trust me), you could tell that Hepburn was in quite formidable control of her role. I couldn't let this review go by without mentioning the delicious telephone scene in CHARADE, surely a nod to a similar, electrically-charged scene in NOTORIOUS between Grant and Ingrid Bergman. It works, of course, just as one can believe Reggie chasing after Peter despite the discrepancy in their ages.With a great cast, a great script and excellent direction by Stanley Donen (which might explain the Gene Kelly references--one explicit and another subtler--in the film), one really wonders why anyone would even consider remaking CHARADE (i.e. save yourself the trouble of seeing 'The Truth About Charlie', and watch this instead). Grant already is irreplaceable. Add in the other elements of this film--suspense, comedy, drama, the luminous Audrey Hepburn--and CHARADE really is untouchable. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie having no idea what it was about, only knowing who was in it, which was enough for me. I don't like thrillers and mysteries much but I figured that with Audrey Hepburn being in it I was safe from that.This film really worked. Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant had great chemistry, and it was great to see both of them, especially Grant, in different roles than I was used to. It kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. I was always wondering what could possibly happen next, and my eyes were always glued to the screen because something important was always just about to happen.The writing for this movie was amazing. The plot was well thought out and although the action was almost constant, everything related to the central plot.I'd recommend this film to anyone. It can appeal to people who like classics, dramas, romances, thrillers, and even comedies. Five stars : )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not the movie I remembered-- its self-consciousness about duplicating the mode of light-Hitchcock (such as NORTH BY NORTHWEST) is disingenuous, and the remarkable cast I remembered isn't given much chance to shine. But one aspect is extraordinary-- Charles Lang's color work, in the spanking Turner Classic Movie print, makes watching the film on mute an appealing option. Watch the colors in the stamp-market sequence-- or more obviously, watch his devotion to the beauties of Grant and Hepburn: if your television is half-decent, you will begin feeling cheated by the drab projections elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cary Grant and James Coburn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the only other director that could carry off a serious side to Cary Grant successfully. Stanley Donen, already proving himself in 'Indiscreet', displays that now that Grant's alliance with Hitchcock is over, Grant's career is not. Admittedly, Grant's days of romantic-comedies no longer carries any weight inthe 1960's, but the notorious side of him does. In 'Charade', we see shades of 'Suspicion' as well as 'Notorious'. Just who is Cary Grant's character, and is he an antagonist? We loved the suspence. We loved the journey. The romantic comedies between 'North by Northwest' and 'Charade' did not have much kudos for the 60's, but a serious side of Grant was something that could still be explored. In Audrey Hepburn, fresh from 'Breakfast at Tiffany's', we emotionally connected with her as a sort of everyman suspicious of Grant's notorious character. Donen took all of what Grant did before in previous Hitchcock movies (with the exception of 'North by Northwest'), and used it to produce a non-Hitchcock Cary Grant thriller. In addition to this, Donen combines Grant's reputation and skill for romantic-comedies, and uses it in his engagement with Hepburn. This is probably a culmination of 'Suspicion', 'Notorious' and all of Grant's romantic comedies thrown together in the one film, and used to produce a non-Hitchcock thriller. The film gains more weight with James Coburn as a supporting actor, as well as George Kennedy throwing his weight around with Grant. The suspense of the film builds up in a Hitchcockian manner, and you feel that Donen is on to something good here. The question is, does it belong in the Grant canon? If you enjoyed 'Suspicion' and 'Notorious' as well as Grant's romantic comedies like 'My Favourite Wife', then I guess you would want to purchase 'Charade' as part of your Grant library. If you see 'Suspicion' as significant in Grant's career, but not entertaining enough to collect, then you can just learn from the experience to apply to your own career. For me, I have a love-hate relationship with the film. I collected it after my first viewing, and then disposed of it after a while. The one thing that is undisputable, is that the only other director apart from Hitchcock who could capture the serious side of Grant successfully was Stanley Donen, and 'Charade' explains why.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightful comedy/thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn turn in two of their most delicious performances. Hepburn is at her peak (not quite so girlish as Roman Holiday or Sabrina) and Cary Grant is... well, Cary Grant. Plenty of tension mixed in with the humor. A must for any fan of Grant, Hepburn, or just the whole early-60s comedy/thriller genre. The only flaw is in the revelation of the "McGuffin" that everybody is chasing; I won't reveal it here, except to say that once they find it nobody (least of all the scriptwriter) seems to realize that it is no longer valuable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overdone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is supposed to be a Hitchcockian-style thriller mixed with comedy and romance. But it never really succeeds in any category.Audrey Hepburn plays Reggie, an American living in Paris married to a Swiss husband she now wants to divorce because she doesn't love him and he has been too dishonest. But when she admits this to a female friend of hers, the husband has already been murdered, and he had already sold all their furniture and had tickets to leave for Venezuela. On top of that, three men are threatening her, demanding a fortune in $250,000 that she supposedly has-but she doesn't. She is contacted by a man in the American Embassy who tells her the story about how, during World War Two, some OSS agents were supposed to have delivered that money to the French Resistance but instead stole it. On top of that, another man meets her, knowing what is going on, and Reggie is unsure if he is a friend-or foe.Reggie has a sort of romance with this man, despite his own dishonesty over who he is and what his name is. There are also ridiculous scenes such as his taking a shower with his clothes on, and so much running back and forth that it gets tedious. The characters are undeveloped, the romance doesn't work, and there are too few laughs for a comedy. Nice try, but it just didn't work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all time favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my all time favorite movies. I used to watch it at least once a week my senior year of high school. I watched it so much I knew almost the whole movie word for word. I didn't have cable in my room and had not even heard of the internet. O.o It was the late 80s so all I had was my small TV and a VHS VCR player.Below are comments that may be considered spoilers.Some of my favorite parts are:* When they are on the river boats and the lights go out and "Peter" says 'it's okay, come and look." Spot lights are put on couples kissing. Then they kiss. It is very sweet.* When Reggie asks How can you tell if a person is lying and "Peter" tells her the story about the truthful white foot and the lying black foot.* When they are walking by the water talking about who did it and she is eating ice cream. You just have to watch it to understand. Reggie (Regina) changes the subject midstream and it is funny.* The end of the movie when she finds out who "Peter" really is and she says, 'You can't even be honest about being dishonest.' or something like that, it has been awhile since I've seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Donen directed this romantic mystery set in Paris that stars Audrey Hepburn as Regina Lampert, who was about to divorce her husband when he is found murdered, and learns that not only had he converted their(now missing) fortune into cash, but that he got it by stealing a payroll back in WWII. Shocked, she is befriended by a mysterious man(played by Cary Grant) who offers to help her, which she will need since she is pursued by a group of criminals(played by George Kennedy &amp; James Coburn, among others) who are also after the money, and don't mind murder to get it. Walter Matthau also costars in a mysterious capacity. Entertaining film with Audrey once again paired off with an older man, and also has a good score and interesting plot, which keeps viewer guessing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Script, and Lots of Twists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess I should mention that I'm a sucker for a good mystery novel. I love reading them, and I enjoy being surprised at the end. Of course, the best mysteries won't rely entirely on a shocking conclusion. Witty dialogue, memorable characters, reasonable suspense, and most importantly, plot twists, must be peppered and laced throughout. The great thing about Charade, is that it takes everything that you could possibly want in a mystery novel, and puts it all under one roof.A young woman named Regina Lambert finds herself in possession of a large sum of money when her husband dies and leaves her $250,000. Unfortunately for her, three men are convinced that the money is theirs, and they're determined to get it back. With no one else to turn to, Regina puts her trust in a stranger named Peter Joshua. The two must now not only outsmart the three crooks, but also solve the mystery Regina's husband has left behind.Charade ingeniously blends the best elements of any mystery book, into a single film, creating an engaging and entertaining experience that's both intelligent and exciting. Clever dialogue and some quirky situations helps inject humor and fun into the production, while a handful of chase scenes keeps things exciting. With the added threat of three crooks living right next door, Charade is rarely dull.The romance between the two leads is surprisingly well done. It's a little overdone at times, but it's not too schmaltzy, nor too formulaic. It finds a perfect balance that few films ever achieve. The chemistry between the leads is excellent, as their personalities easily compliment each other. Modern romance films should take notes.The mystery itself is genius. There are several plot twists throughout, but all of them seem minuscule when compared to the grand finale. While many similar films often fails to provide much punch during the "revealing" stage, Charade pulls of it's big twist at the end beautifully. Characters are both memorable, and likable (or dislikeable, depending on intentions), with great acting to boot. Audrey Hepburn as Regina may appear helpless at first, but she quickly becomes an independent and brave woman, ready to fend for herself. Cary Grant as Peter is suave, but without being romantic. His maturity contrasts Regina's childishness. The three crooks (James Corburn, George Kennedy, and Ned Glass) are menacing, though not as defined as other characters. Jacques Marin as Inspector Grandpierre gets several laughs as the cranky policeman.The score, composed by Henry Mancini, is excellent. Often jazzy, but not without suspense and tension, it's a solid work from the master composer.A truly thrilling and surprising film, Charade is an extremely charming and masterfully made production. With a great cast, witty screenplay, and some great twists, this is the ideal mystery movie. If you're the kind that enjoys mystery novels, this is for you. If you're not into mystery novels, try it anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tossed off a train like a sack of flour, a body dressed only in pajamas and a housecoat tumbles from the tracks down an embankment. Then the credits appear. Colorful and wavy lines morph into a labyrinth, then spinning fan-like wheels, and then turning arrows. Yes we will soon discover that this movie is like a maze, an enigma; nothing is what it seems. The next scene is at a ski resort at the Haute-Savoie Alps, where our heroine, Mrs. Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn), a EURESCO translator, tells her sister that she has decided to end her loveless marriage to her husband Charles, supposedly a Swiss national. He has been lying and living a mystery. What she does not know is that Charles is already dead.She returns form her Alpine trip to Paris, where she finds her apartment completely empty. She runs into inspector Grandpierre, who escorts her to his office. He explains that Charles had sold everything for $250,000 US (1.25 million francs) at public auction and tried to flee the country to Venezuela before he was killed on the train. The $250,000 is missing, and Regina is unable to answer the inspector's questions. Grandpierre gives Regina her husband's remaining items in a small Lufthansa flight bag. They include a wallet with 4,000 francs, a stamped but unsealed and unsent letter, a steamship ticket, and some personal items. Regina is stunned when the inspector produces four passports from her husband. He tells her that her husband's real name was Charles Voss, not Lambert, and he was an American, not Swiss. Upon returning to her apartment, she is surprised to find Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) waiting for her. She had briefly met and befriended him at the Alps; he found out about her situation in the newspapers and stopped in to help. Later Regina receives a call from the US Embassy in Paris, Mr. Hamilton Bartholomew (Walther Matthau). Meeting with him, he explains to Regina that he is the local CIA boss and that her late husband and four others stole $250,000 in gold (military payroll) towards the end of World War II. One of the men, Carson Dyle, supposedly was shot and killed by the Germans. Another was Charles Voss, who stole the cash from the others and vanished until his recent, publicized murder. The money remains missing. Bartholomew stresses that Regina is in danger because of the double-cross and the other three men are looking for the loot, of which she has absolutely no knowledge. Of course the cash still belongs to the US government.At her husband's wake are just three: Regina, her sister, and Grandpierre. Three unsavory men arrive at different times to examine the body lying in state. They are Gideon (Ned Glass), Scobie (George Kennedy), and Panthollow (James Coburn); the last one has a hook for a hand. Afterwards the three men separately threaten Regina; we learn (if we had not already ascertained) that they are the three payroll thieves. Before long, it appears that Joshua is in collusion with the three x-GIs. Soon after, during Regina's second meeting with Bartholomew, he says that Peter Joshua is going by the name of the deceased Carson Dyle, who is after the money. Subsequently, when Regina confronts Joshua, he admits that he is tracking down the money, but that he is the brother of the deceased Dyle. He has made the three men believe that he is working with them, but he is not. He believes that the three men murdered Dyle because he was against the theft. But later, on the telephone, Bartholomew tells Regina that Dyle had no brother. After a physical confrontation with Scobie, Dyle claims his real name is Alexander. Later, when dead bodies begin to appear dressed in their pajamas, he claims he is really Adam Canfield, a gentleman thief simply after stolen money. By this time poor Regina is really so confused and does not know what to accept.The mystery begins to clarify a bit when our two protagonists and a surviving antagonist arrive at the open stamp market at the Jardins des Champs-Elysees. Not long after, there is a chase within the Paris Metro, and a final confrontation at the Colonnades and on stage (and below) at the Royal Palace Theatre. But no spoilers are given here. Suffice it to say that this is one of those lightly suspenseful and sophisticated, tasteful, and witty romantic mystery thrillers of the sixties. The Parisian settings are a plus. What great lead actors, and what a fine supporting cast we a have! And do the two leads not have great screen chemistry in their only outing together? The suave and charismatic Cary Grant is incomparable. Audrey Hepburn, elegant and debonair, has always been great as an innocent, vulnerable, woman-in-peril type. Can anyone dislike Walter Matthau? Finally, the Mancini musical score, as usual with the artist's tunes, is always appealing and enthralling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my all time favorite films and I've seen it about 40 or more times over the years. You can't go wrong with Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. This is Stanley Donen's masterpiece. He gathered together a fantastic cast: Grant and Hepburn, Walter Matthau, a wily trio of thugs including: James Coburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass and a smattering of excellent French supporting actors. One of its many charms is that is filmed in Paris. Art direction, sound, editing, a wonderful music score by Henry Mancini, costumes for Hepburn by Givenchy that add to her glamour and more assure its status a classic. Donen adds quite a few Hitchcockian touches in the dialog and cinematic scenes. An example: Peter Joshua, Alexander Dyle, Adam Canfield and Brian Cruikshank. If you see the movie you'll know who they are. Plot involves gold stolen from the Nazis in World War II by a few GI's and what's become of it. From the first frame to the last Charade delivers comedy, thrills, chills and romance. What more could a film give an audience. Don't miss Charade!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classy, endlessly entertaining thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) is a young American woman on vacation in Paris, whose marriage to her husband Charlie is about to unravel. The situation is solved quite unexpectedly when Charlie is murdered, and almost instantly Regina realizes that something sinister is going on. During WWII her husband had been a member of the OSS who had stolen a shipment of Nazi gold along with several others, and now the surviving gang members (James Coburn, George Kennedy, Ned Glass) are willing to kill Reggie to get it back. Bewildered, frightened, but always with ready with a snappy comeback, Reggie holds her own, but must rely on a seemingly upright CIA Agent (Walter Matthau) and a man whose name, identity, and allegiance seems to change at every turn (Cary Grant) to find the money and avoid a grisly fate at the hands of the criminals."Charade" is a borderline impossible film to classify. The plot description makes it seem like a rather straightforward Hitchcockian thriller: an individual trapped in circumstances they don't understand, protagonists who can't be fully trusted, menacing bad guys, and a rather ingenious Macguffin. But the movie also works as a wonderful romantic comedy, with an extremely witty script and two old-school Hollywood romantic leads. That the film works as both is a testament to its status as a classic. It may not be the smartest or most inventive film of all time, but it's certainly one of the most entertaining.The main attraction of the film is undoubtedly the two leads. Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant were both stars of classic Hollywood, and both were entering the later stages of their careers. Audrey Hepburn is simply one of the greats. She aged incredibly well on film, maintaining the class and lovable straightforwardness from her earlier films, and adding to it a degree of sophistication and wit as she grew older. Audrey's charm is undeniable; even in her lesser works like "Breakfast at Tiffany's", it's almost impossible to dislike Audrey. In "Charade" she is as beautiful as ever, dressed in a gorgeous array of Givenchy dresses, and carries herself with her trademark class and dignity. If anything she's more appealing in this film than in "Roman Holiday" or "Sabrina".On the other end is Cary Grant, one of Hollywood's greatest leading men, nearing the end of his career. His character is never who he seems; his identity and name change every other scene or so. You WANT to think that he's a good guy, I mean he IS Cary Grant, and he IS flirting with Audrey Hepburn. But when Reggie sees him conspiring with the three villains, when he gives himself a different name in every scene, how can you be sure? The film somehow manages to pull this character off without it being laughable or predictable, and I think Grant is to be credited for this. He and Hepburn have great chemistry and are helped by a witty script with an endless stream of verbal bantering, which together makes their rather large age difference superfluous. Nowadays, these two actors playing these characters would be decried for "typecasting" or "lack of range", but when something works, particularly as well as in a film like this... who cares?The film makes brilliant use of gorgeous Paris scenery throughout, and features marvelous set pieces, most notably a roof-top fight between Grant and Kennedy's characters and the lengthy chase sequence/shootout at the climax. Peter Stone's fine screenplay deserves credit for somehow managing to amalgamate the comedy and thriller aspects and keep the viewer guessing as to who the bad guy is. Charles Lang's cinematography captures both the beauty of Paris and also adds a touch of darkness appropriate to the story. Stanley Donen's direction is fabulous and he keeps a brisk, even, suspenseful pace throughout. Henry Mancini provides a catchy and extremely memorable score.The supporting cast is also solid. Walter Matthau does a good job as the CIA Agent who seems to be the one honest character in the film. James Coburn, George Kennedy, and Ned Glass are perfectly cast as the menacing yet goofy bad guys. Coburn and Kennedy would soon go on to bigger things and they show why in this film, while Glass is wonderful as the obnoxious sniveling twerp. Jacques Marin also provides an amusing turn as the bewildered French policeman investigating the whole mess ("Three men dead in their pajamas? What is this, a new American fad?").All in all, "Charade" is just a fun film to watch. It works on many different levels and anyone looking for a pleasant waste of two hours should definitely check it out. Supercritical writers could pick out the various plot holes and improbabilities, or pick out the plot twists before they develop. But most viewers will undoubtedly be charmed by the two leads, the wonderful script, and the gorgeous Paris scenery, all the while wondering whodunit? And that's all one can really ask from a film like this.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Some Spoilers) With her marriage on the rocks UN interpreter Regina "Reggie" Lampert, Audrey Hepburn,is seriously considering filing for divorce against her never at home husband Charles but first she'll have to find him. Returning back home to Paris from a ski vacation in the Alps Reggie is first shocked to find that her very spacious apartment suite is totally empty of clothes and furniture. Later Reggie gets the shock of her life in finding that the police did in fact find Charles dead from being thrown from a speeding train.With this mysterious Peter Joshua, among his many other aliases, played by the very cheerful charming and witty Cary Grant popping up all over the place we're, both Reggie and the audience, walked through the movies very complicated plot that has to do with a missing 250,000.00 dollars in gold. The gold that was stolen from the French Resistance back in 1944. It seems that the CIA, back in 1944 when it was called the OSS, was involved in this transaction that was covertly sabotaged by four of it's very greedy and unpatriotic member. One of them included the now deceased Charles Lampert. The three surviving former OSS agents, or spies, Tex Herman &amp; Lenny, James Coburn George Kennedy &amp; Ned Glass, are now out looking for the stolen gold and feel that Reggie being that she was married to Charles, a member of the gang of four who suspected of stealing the money , knows where the missing cash is and will go so far as to commit murder to get it.The movie "Charade" has so many twists and turns that by the time that its over you feel like a pretzel in trying to follow them. There's Reggie and the mysterious Peter Joshua getting involved in all sorts of entanglements with the three former OSS agents in their attempt to find the missing money. The fact that the money is right in front of them, in what Charles had with him on the train at the time of his murder. This is all so obvious that for a moment I had the feeling that they were either too blind or drunk, on that rich exquisite and full bodied French wine, for them to see it and that includes both Reggie and Peter.Peter who changes identifies like you would change socks during the movie. From a member of the Rothschild family to the brother of one of the crooked OSS men, who was killed by the Germans, to an agent of the US Treasury Department or Diplomatic Corps or to just plain Gary Grant. The guy is just a bit, to say the least, too much for the already confused and befuddled Riggie to take. Riggie later gets in touch, in order to get a handle of just what exactly is going on, with the CIA's man in Paris the ultra secretive and shadowy H. Bartholemeu, Walter Matthau. Bartholemeu comes across as being so oily and slippery, in his keeping things to himself, that he looks like he was accidentally dropped into a barrel of crude oil, doesn't make things any better for her as well.It soon becomes obvious that one of the four surviving renegade OSS agents is the one who murdered Charles Lampert. With the other ex-OSS men getting knocked off one by one until there's none of the ex-OSS men left alive to find the stolen and missing cash it becomes quite clear that the killer might very well be the lovable and friendly Peter Joshua himself. An eccentric sort of a guy who's so harmless and lovable, even though he can get a bit testy and sarcastic when you push him too far, that you wouldn't worry at all about him being left alone with your teenage daughter or your pet poodle.Like they say looks can be deceiving and from what we've seen in Peter's strange and bizarre actions like taking showers with all his, except his shoes, clothes on he might very well not be what we, and Reggie, all think that he actually is: A happy go lucky bumbling, if not a bit fluttery between the ears, schmuck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Everybody wants to be like Cary Grant(and Audrey Hepburn)'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A superbly stylish sub-Hitchcock comedy-thriller,only Hitch didn't make it.Still,it had the classiest leading actors ever(Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn),a witty script(Peter Stone),impeccable direction(Stanley Donen) and a faultless supporting cast(Walter Matthau,James Coburn,George Kennedy).The story is of course decidedly far-fetched,but this is a minor negative as the film was designed to be pure entertainment,which it succeeds in achieving in spades. Despite the greying hair and nearing sixty,Grant is still as handsome as ever,and despite the marked age difference between him and Hepburn,they make one of the best screen couples of all time.With any other actor of his age,it would've been an embarrassment but the witty,clever banter and romantic clinches are funny,delightful and charming.The most memorable of many memorable scenes for me is a beautifully judged sequence featuring Cary and Audrey on the boat trip on the Seine.In it's own way,this is one of the most charming and romantic scenes of it's kind ever filmed. CHARADE does counter balance it's superb romantic comedy elements with a surprisingly ruthless edge with the amount of killings involved,done in an admittedly imaginative way but still a trifle over-macabre.But the plot twists are very clever and suspense builds extremely effectively,and despite the plot's improbability,CHARADE still succeeds in being enormously funny,entertaining and thrilling. Screenwriter Stone and director Donen applied this style three years later with ARABESQUE,and although the results were perfectly acceptable,with Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren a decent romantic screen pairing,it didn't repeat the greater all round brilliance that CHARADE passed off with such élan.It is a shame Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn never made another film together,but we can be all grateful that they at least appeared alongside each other once;the chemistry achieved has rarely been matched anywhere else.CHARADE is now rightly regarded as a classic of it's kind,and it's reputation will hopefully continue to grow.RATING:9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You know what's wrong with you?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You know what's wrong with you?" Audrey Hepburn demands of Cary Grant in "Charade." Then, moving aggressively toward him, "Nothing." The same is true for Stanley Donen's "Charade." From beginning to end, the film pretends to be nothing more than it is: brilliant entertainment.It also functions, perhaps, as the most "revealing" exposure of two Hollywood stars ever filmed. "Exposure" because, at moments, the carefully tailored script invites Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant to be loose and silly -- an opportunity never afforded either of them on screen before or since.In being silly, we see and know more about Hepburn and Grant as PEOPLE (forget their roles, here, or their Hollywood personas) than in any of their other films.Their delight in working together as actors is palpable from the opening.Their surprising chemistry together seems to develop before our eyes. Their playfulness grows and grows until, at the final reveal, Hepburn opens an American Embassy office door in Paris to discover that the man she (and we) alternately loved, rooted for, suspected and feared has always been a United States official -- and he's making a cross-eyed goofy face at her.We have no reliable way of knowing if that idiotic look was scripted or simply improvised by Mr. Grant and wisely included in the final cut by Director/Producer Donen.Coming thirty years into Grant's remarkably long-lived career, that perfectly-timed boyish stupid expression effectively undercuts his entire filmic persona -- while simultaneously being true to the character and the relationship that has blossomed with Miss Hepburn's character.(Hepburn's responses during "Charade," where her character is essentially a passive victim of circumstances, exhibit astonishing range -- from elegant boredom to sadness, resignation, bewilderment, fright, love, courage. One cannot take one's eyes off her. She too seems to relax here more than in any other of her films, revealing an unencumbered sexuality and forthrightness not apparent in other of her roles.)The sequence with Mr. Grant showering fully clothed is, in retrospect, almost jaw-dropping. Funny? Yes. Shocking? Well, for a supposedly heterosexual screen icon to play this stereotypically "gay" may seem shocking today. Limp wrists, sing-song voice, mincing steps and all. How Mr. Donen ever convinced Grant to play this scene this way, or why Grant delivered, it still remains a fascinatingly comic picture of a deeply and "secretly" conflicted homosexual actor of a certain era camping it up. And camp it up Grant does. The sequence went over the heads of audiences of the early '60s, when "Charade" was released. Nobody was openly gay then.Knowing what we do today, it's delightful. And shocking on more than one level.Just another "in" joke like others threaded through this film. ("Here we are, on the street where you live," anybody?)The supporting players are all strong. Particularly Walter Matthau, playing (finally and convincingly) against type.Then, there are Miss Hepburn's costumes. Givenchy. Has anyone ever looked so gorgeous or worn clothes so well? Hepburn's celebrated collaboration with Givenchy in both her personal and screen lives is thoroughly documented. Yet here, for some reason (ask Donen) her wardrobe commands attention in every frame.How are clothes CUT like that? What is that coat MADE of? How did they get the seams in that hat? Has any woman -- in Paris OR New York -- ever dressed this well? Nah.She's Audrey Hepburn, you see. And he's Cary Grant.If you want to see two actors, two Golden Age Stars, generations apart, obviously delight in each others' talents and fall in love on screen, glamorously, while undercutting their own glamor and defying you to figure out who's who . . . see "Charade."A tour de force on every level."What's wrong with it?" "Nothing."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not close to Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People say they mistake this for a Hitchcock film. It's got a long way to go before it make it to that level. The acting by Hepburn in the most part seems awkward and not believable in the least. Grant is as good as ever. Its got a Hitchcock theme in mistaken identities, but me thinks Hitchcock would've classed it up a bit. The "MacGuffin" is great, I wont reveal it, but it's a nice touch. There are scenes, such as the last one, and the shooting scene which could've used Hitchcock's artful, and more visual hand. Other than a slight disappointment in acting and flow, and a lack of 'tricks' which would've made the memorable scenes more memorable, this is a competent comedy/thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a disappointment beyond words. Bumbling director Donen somehow managed to get two fabulous actors like Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant with Paris as a backdrop and still comes up with a turkey that is such an insult to smart audiences that I couldn't watch this til the end. There are just too many crucial moments when the movie is sabotaged repetitively from his clumsy, hamfisted work.The story is not too bad but the overacting, including, shockingly, from Hepburn, just spoils everything. The one-liners are weak and sound lame, just like most of the dialogue. You cringe at it when compared to masterpieces from Hitchcock where simplicity assures a timeless elegance that is sorely missed here.What a waste! Don't bother with this one if you appreciate well written film noir. How this could ever get such a high rating beggars belief.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Vibrant Spectacle of Twists and Turns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know how fate drew me to this movie out of hundreds of possibilities, but I promise to be forever grateful. Despite the box- office-busting stars present, this little gem remains relatively obscure. The Grant-Hepburn team was truly delightful- what a shame it was never repeated.In that vein, this is one of the quirkiest films I would have pictured these two typically refined actors working in. While hardly screwball, the performances were definitely not the straight-laced fare I am used to seeing. They really seemed to just be having fun, bantering and goofing off. I think it's great when an actor doesn't have to worry about making every line come out like Shakespeare.The film itself, with its psychedelic James Bond-like intro and self- aware cornball dialog still manages to be gripping. Lots of twists and turns right up until the end- it really keeps you on your toes and interested. A bit more violence than I was expecting for a 60s flick. Nothing overtly gory, of course, but I was shocked that the audience was allowed shots of an asphyxiated corpse.In the end, though, this is a film that will win your heart, and attention, solely on its ability to entertain. No thrilling car chases, no sex in a dark alley, not even a particularly inspiring script. Just a solidly intriguing plot and excellent banter between two of the screen's loveliest gems. And honestly, what more could you ask for in a film?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever "whodunnit" in Paris, with Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening music for "Charade" sounded so familiar, maybe because in 1963 I was a recent high school graduate and about to turn 18. Cary Grant was 59, starring in his 75th film, and only made two others after this one. Audrey Hepburn was 34, and "Charade" came between two of her most memorable films, "Breakfast at Tiffanys" and "My Fair Lady." In this one she plays an easily love-struck lady who actually makes several plays for the affections of the older Grant.SPOILERS follow, read cautiously.Returning home in Paris from a ski vacation, where she met Grant, she finds the place empty, stripped, no clothes, nothing, her husband had auctioned off everything for $250,000 and was headed for Argentina, his belongings later showed. He is found dead, thrown off a train in rural France, and they suspect he had $250,000 which had been stolen during the war, in 1944. Figuring she had the money now, it appears that 4 others are looking for it, including Grant, Matthau, Coburn, and George Kennedy. But she was clueless. The 3 stamps on the envelope addressed to her were worth $250,000!! One at a time, each of the 4 turn up murdered, until only two remain - Grant and Matthau. Turns out Matthau, playing a CIA agent, is the bad guy, Grant, who is the real government good guy, gets both the upper hand and the girl in the end!Interesting setting for the climax, an empty theater at night, Hepburn is in the cue pit, Matthau is walking towards her on stage, gun in hand, while Grant is below. Just at the last moment, he pulls the trap door release and Matthau falls through.The story is mainly a romantic comedy, with a serious theme. The writing is clever, with a lot of reparte' between Grant and Hepburn, as if the writers delighted in their own cuteness. However, it works well for a 1963 film, but wouldn't go over so well today. A thoroughly enjoyable "whodunnit" that mainly kept me guessing right up to the end, I rate it "8" of 10, and probably would have been a "10" for 1963. It is worth the time just to see Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn at the top of their craft in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CHARADE is a top-notch star-vehicle ingeniously incorporates laughter onto the usual whodunit template</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the waning of Hollywood musicals, Stanley Donen, the king of the Hollywood musicals, steers into comedy genre and convenes two of the most popular and bankable movie stars in the business, Hepburn and Grant, concocts another exceedingly entertaining masterpiece, CHARADE, penned by Peter Stone, blithely blends a Hitchcock-ian thriller with a rom-com with banters galore, and the result is superbly satisfactory, if one compares it with a later analogue, the Goldie Hawn- Chevy Chase vehicle FOUL PLAY (1978) made by Colin Higgins, one can effortlessly taste the difference in quality, how the storyline of the latter is dumbed down to a no-brainer and the characterisation of its female protagonist as a dim-witted blond is plain prosaic.CHARADE is a nonpareil of the hybridisation of comedy-thriller-romance, Regina (Hepburn) is a newly widowed American in Paris, the mysterious murder of her husband Charlie brings danger to her too, since it concerns a fortune stolen by Charlie and his cohorts during WWII, yet she doesn't have a clue about its whereabout, soon, a knight errant appears, an American compatriot named Peter Joshua (Grant), voluntarily offers her his protection, but whose real identity will only reveal in the film's coda, a minor spoiler, he has four identities altogether. Grant was approaching sixty when the film was making while Hepburn was in her early thirties, the May-December romance seems incongruent at first, but Hepburn had already mastered a wondrous rapport with Gary Cooper in Billy Wilder's LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON (1957) with a 28- year age difference, also it is a stale manoeuvre in the industry to pair senior matinée idols with red-hot and much younger female stars. Thus, Stone's script leans heavily on Regina's proactive move, to contrast Peter's more self-effacing and suave appearance. Hepburn has what we call the essentials of a screen idol, she can enchant audience with her innate geniality and sublime elegance, and leave them forget how far-fetched or ridiculous sometimes the narrative turns out to be. Grant can do the same trick in his prime, but here, his downplayed joviality and less outspoken nature suit the role very well, the most droll moment comes when he takes a shower with his drip- dried suit on, although it is amazing to see him still acquire agility in all the chasing and jumping sequences.Matthau plays the CIA administrator Hamilton Bartholomew, who summons Regina in insisting that the missing fortune should be given back to USA, and holds the key of the big twist, which is not that out-of-the-blue, due to the movie's rather small cast, there would not be enough red-herrings in the killing game. James Coburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass are three cohorts discharging menace and distrust invariably in their one-note design, and Jacques Marin's inept French gendarme brings the ultimate deadpan humour.The film is snubbed by the Academy despite being a lucrative box-office hit, only Henry Mancini's alluring theme song is blessed with an Oscar nomination, and CHARADE is a top-notch star-vehicle ingeniously incorporates laughter onto the usual whodunit template, which very few of today's mainstream products can remotely match.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blending Stars With Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No need to recap the convoluted plot. Sure much of the storyline is contrived. But then the movies aren't much like real life, which I believe is a big reason we go to them. Of course, the more realism in a movie, the less obvious contrivance there should be. But Charade is tongue-in-cheek romanticism from the git- go. Besides, the stars here, Grant and Hepburn, have enough charm and charisma to slide us over the logical rough spots. Then too, the narrative is a cleverly constructed guessing game. We never know what the next twist will be, right down to the final scene. Thus we're engaged from the start. Still, the 2-hour runtime is more than the developments need. But then plot threads have to accommodate the two celebrities with enough personal screen time to show their shine. Lengthening runtime was always a problem with star-studded A-productions, and is why many of those compact old B-movies often carried greater impact. Impact's not a particular problem here, since the screenplay does a pretty good job of combining star-power with storyline, even if concessions to Grant and Hepburn are made. Overall, the film remains an entertaining slice of intrigue of the sort popular at the time. And fortunately, the appeal has lost little over the decades.</fullReview>

However, this is also romantic comedy. I like the scene of Peter takes shower wearing clothes. It is very funny so I was impressed with it. Second, I like character of the film. Peter is cool and funny. Regina is my favorite character because she is very pretty. When I first watched in my childhood, I wanted to be that woman. Third, I like the fashion in this film. This film made 1963, but fashion is enduring now. In addition, Audrey Hepburn is very beautiful and she fits the cute clothes. This film has nice plots, characters are funny and fashion is cute.

		<fullReview>Being a true fan of Cary Grant for many years,I find it practically impossible not to adore this almost perfect film!!REALLY..! Being characterized as"the best Hitchock film that Hitchock never made",in my opinion "Charade" combines every element that makes a film classic and at the same time a sheer joy to watch!! More precisely, it includes two screen legends,clever plot with twists and smart lines, nice supporting actors, suspense, a sophisticated love story and a perfect musical background by Henry Mancini-...in other words this is as good as it gets!! Audrey Hepburn plays Regina Lambert,a young woman whose late husband's mysterious illegal connections when they are revealed get her into trouble, since she had no idea!!!...And of course at this point enters Cary Grant who appears willing to help her and trustworthy..but is he?In my opinion, one of the main elements that makes this film so unique is the fact that Cary Grant ,plays one of his most popular roles in his filmography in such a sophisticated and comfortable way that depicts his confidence and star quality just perfectly. What if his leading co-star is 20 years younger?-his absolutely smooth way and his incomparable style cover this soft spot completely. Generally,Cary Grant during the 50's and the 60's is quite clear that chooses to perform in a more sophisticated and less extroverted way, in comparison to his popular roles in the earlier decades of the 30's and the 40's.Thanks to this change he demonstrates the extent of his talent. Probably he makes that change due to the fact that he is a bit older and therefore much more experienced and confident and has no need to prove his value to anyone. Of course in order to be fair we have to acknowledge Audrey Hepburn's talent as well as her comfort and wit that match perfectly with Grant's more introverted character.Let's be honest..!who else could ask Grant "how does he shave up there?" in a cuter way?..I believe no one...If you like suspense, clever and hilarious lines and you like Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant there is no reason to miss this nearly perfect film 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Funny Face" director Stanley Donen's suspenseful and mysterious crime thriller "Charade" assembles Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn together in Paris as they search for a quarter of a million dollars. Composer Henry Mancini received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Music Score. The cast is first-class with George Kennedy, James Coburn, Ned Glass, and Walter Matthau playing the villains who will do whatever it takes to find the loot. "Charade" has enough twists and turns to keep you interested throughout its 113 minute running time. The scene where Grant has to remove an orange from a stout woman's body in a French restaurant without using his hands is amusing.The story really begins in World War II when the villains were U.S. Army agents working with the Office of Strategic Services. This quintet was ordered to deliver $200-thousand dollars to the French Resistance. The resistance never got the money The action opens as a body of Charles Lampert is hurled from a train careening through Europe. The authorities find Lampert's pajama-clad corpse lying next to the tracks of the Paris-Bordeaux railroad line. According to the dates, the police reported Lampert's death on May 4, 1963. Meantime, the murdered man's wife, Regina (Audrey Hepburn) is planning to divorce Charles because she doesn't love him. She feels that Charles has been keeping something from her. When she returns to Paris, Regina finds their apartment barren and a police inspector, Inspector Edouard Grandpierre (Jacques Marin of "Shaft in Africa"), waiting for her. Later, in his office, Inspector Grandpierre points out that Charles had bought a ticket for a ship sailing in the morning for Venezuela. Naturally, Regina is confused. She tells Grandpierre that Charles was a Swiss citizen. He tells the policeman that Charles had no profession. Not only does stashed his money. An exasperated Grandpierre wants to know what happened to the quarter of a million dollars that Charles received from the public auction where he sold the contents of their apartment. The only thing found that belonged to Lampert was a blue Lufthansa traveling bag with his passport, an unsealed letter, a wallet with four thousand francs, an agenda with the last notation written on a Thursday, a ticket to South America, a comb, toothbrush, and a container of tooth powder, etc. Now, Regina is truly mystified by all this information.Later, she runs into a mystery man who she met initially at the ski resort and afterward at her apartment. Regina tells this individual that she plans to get her job back at EURESCO where she works as a simultaneous translator like her friend Sylvie. Unlike Sylvie who translated English into French, Regina translates French into English. She was working as a translator before she met and married Charles. Since she cannot remain at the apartment, Regina allows her mystery man to help her find an affordable hotel. The scene that ensues is pretty strange. Essentially, the villains make their entrance at the funeral. Aside from Sylvie and Regina, the only person attending the funeral is Grandpierre. The inspector sits quietly and clips his fingernails. The first of the villains to enter is Leopold W. Gideon (Ned Glass of "Blindfold"); he sneezes on Charles' corpse. The next is Tex Panthollow (James Coburn of "Our Man Flint") and he checks Charles' corpse with a mirror to be sure that he is dead. After Tex comes Herman Scobie (George Kennedy of "Cool Hand Luke") who has a mechanical contraption in place of his right hand; he sticks pin into the corpse to check it. A short, thickset man appears after Scobie storms out and hands Regina with a letter from the U.S. Embassy. An official named Bartholomew requests Regina's presence at his office at noon-thirty. Bartholomew is "anxious to discuss the matter" of Charles' death. Bartholomew tells Regina about the war and the mission that Charles embarked on with the others. Bartholomew is an administer for the CIA, He informs Regina that Charles was wanted by the U.S. Government. Specifically, the CIA wants Charles because the money that he received from the auction. Bartholomew tells Regina that Charles stole $250-thousand from the U.S. Government. He suspects that she has the money, but she claims that she doesn't. Nevertheless, Bartholomew urges her to find the money because she is in a great deal of danger. Things really get sticky after this interview."Mirage" scenarist Peter Stone relies on misinformation to distract audiences from solving the mystery as well as the whereabouts of stolen fortune. Although the dialogue is often neat, it isn't quotable. Hepburn gets ample opportunities to scream, be harassed, and feel betrayed, while Grant epitomizes suave sophistication in a suit and tie. Charles Lang's photography is excellent and the camera work in the morgue is imaginative. Hepburn looks gorgeous in a variety of outfits. James Coburn menaces Hepburn in a telephone booth at one point by striking matches and throwing them at her. "Charade" qualifies as an exciting but literate woman-in-jeopardy thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Superb classic thriller!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Charade' is probably one of the finest classic thrillers I've ever seen ? and surprise! No Hitchcock! It is interesting how we always tend to remember the Master of Suspense when talking about those thrillers and sometimes forgot other great and important thrillers made in Hollywood's classic era.This time we have fantastic Audrey Hepburn who plays a widow who sees herself into a plot involving money, the CIA, bad guys and Cary Grant who was the best choice to play the leading man. There is such a chemical between Hepburn and Grant that any other actor or actress would have broken the film's essence completely.But, I warn you: if you are not used to this kind of film, you may find it a little boring. Different from the thrillers made today in Hollywood in which the studios make use of sex and violence to get a huge audience, 'Charade' works in another side. It is not a film developed though scenes, but from smart dialogs, characters and an involving story ? and that is why this film is a classic one and proves once more that we don't need a lot of explosions and sex to have a good movie.I took almost a year to see this movie because I was always reluctant with it ? I was underrating it before even watching. Now, after seeing it, I don't regret a single second for having bought such a superb and unique flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a cute 60s whodunit with Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant. Supporting roles were James Coburn, Walter Matthau, and George Kennedy.It had a twist or two, but nothing particularly eventful. Hepburn was all this movie needed. Grant was aging by this time, although his charm was still present.Set in France, Hepburn was about to divorce her husband when he happened to be murdered. It seems he had a stash of cash that a list of hoodlums wanted. One by one they came to get it from Hepburn, who knew nothing of it. One by one they began dying. By the end, she figured out all and a happy ending was had.Fun movie for a light-hearted evening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sums up the charming, light-hearted spirit of classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the first running minutes of "Charade", I could tell that I was about to watch a very special, outstanding film. The way I feel about classic Hollywood film, especially comedy, is that there is a certain magic about it, something that is able to reconcile the viewer with the world. I've never known exactly what it is -it may be the light-heartedness spirit that those movies convey, with their witty dialog, their absence of any kind of crudeness -or, in the case of dramas and action or adventure films, the moderation and prudence with which adult content was treated-, and the charisma, talent, and elegance of the Golden Era stars. Well, "Charade" is one of the quintessential representatives of all of the above."Charade" is a delightful and very funny comedy, a sexy (for the time it was made) romance and a challenging suspenseful mystery that, yes, reminds of Alfred Hitchcock, and it gives you an idea of what could have come had "Hitch" and the exquisite Audrey Hepburn teamed up. Here, we already have her coupled up with one of Hitchcock's favorite male stars, Cary Grant, and the result couldn't have been better, for they make up one of the most exciting and in-tune on-screen couples. Add to the cast Walter Matthau, Charles Coburn and George Kennedy, and it can't possibly get very far from anyone's dream cast. Set the story in a beautifully photographed Paris, and voila, a glamorous, fast-paced, intelligent, and very funny film.In "Charade", Audrey Hepburn, at the peak of her renowned beauty and her fame, plays Regina Lampert, who finds herself a widow upon returning to her Paris home -her husband has been murdered. She immediately gets a call from US Embassy representative Hamilton Bartholomew (Matthau), who requests that a quarter of a million dollars unlawfully kept by the late Mr Lampert be returned to the Government. But the US Government is not the only one that seeks Mrs Lampert, for she is soon chased after by three mysterious -and not at all friendly- men who were apparently in some kind of relation with her late husband. Only the attractive and nonchalant Peter Joshua (Grant) jumps in for her rescue. Lucky her... or is she? I believe that even those many viewers who are not accustomed or are even perhaps not appealed to classic films could enjoy this. It can hardly get any better.My vote is 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>classy romantic thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having never seen a film with Hepburn (My fair Lady) in before I was very excited about watching this film after her many praises and after watching the opening sequence in the Ski hotel I was immediately hooked.Hepburn stars as Reg Lampert, a sophisticated woman unaware of her husband's life. When hearing of his death she is left with a sum of money, only she doesn't know where it is. What she does know is that many men want it, and they are going to track her down to get it themselves.Conforming brilliantly to a thriller genre, Charade presents a somewhat light-hearted entertainment for the family through the use of a diverse set of characters and their own humour and antics. It's slow at points to allow audiences to become familiar with the characters but when necessary, for example the ending, it becomes fast and tense.Relationships between characters are great, especially between Grant (Monkey Business) and Hepburn who are simply terrific as they try to weigh each other out. Grant's character is very cool and classy and made me pay particular close attention to his actions in the film.The mystery behind this story is great. Audiences are always wondering who has the money and why and through many scenes involving close confrontation between each the film is always exciting and expecting.A few scenes had me put of where the whole plot seemed to easy and not realistic context wise. However it is minimal criticism for a film that is simply entertaining and engaging throughout.Hepburn's character has become one of my all time favourites. Her charisma and attitude towards her position in the film was sensational. Her class and sophistication in the most tense circumstances is a must watch and now I can't wait to see the actress in more films.a must watch for enjoyment</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the dismal Jonathan Demme film The Truth About Charlie, I was left aghast. The film had so much going for it, but besides the surreal, New Wave feel of the end, just before the credits, it was a major letdown. I flipped the disc over upon completion to check out the bonus movie, Charade, which it was based on. I fast-forwarded it a bit and discovered the dialogue was much the same in that part, so I took it out and returned the rental. Now, four years later, I finally took the plunge and sat down to watch Stanley Donen's highly acclaimed Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn vehicle. This one is a winner.After only seeing Grant in Notorious, I wasn't quite ready for the comic chops he shows here, (even though I have heard so much about them from lovers of Bringing Up Baby). The quick wit was enjoyable as he and Hepburn were a great comic team. Sarcasm flowed freely from their lips and helped lay the tracks for why a love tryst could work between a 60 year old man and a 30 year old woman. I'm not quite sure if they tried to make Hepburn's Reggie older, as she looked it in parts, but either way her youthful mannerisms came out on top. Surprisingly, I kept thinking back to Thandie Newton's take on the character from Demme's film, and marveled at the similarities. Their faces are alike, especially the large eyes to get lost in. Grant and Hepburn really looked like they enjoyed each others company and it helped propel their characters through the intelligent, twist-laden script.When Reggie discovers her husband Charles has been killed and that his accomplices, from an old army booty theft, are looking for his money, she doesn't know who to turn to or who to trust. Everyone she encounters has a hidden agenda or identity, tripping up her plans to find the loot and save herself from her husband's fate. Nothing is as it seems and everyone is in on the "charade," including her deceased spouse, whom it seems she really didn't know at all. Her life has been full of strangers and they are all trying to get to know her now, with hopes of finding the spoils. Among the many men she encounters are top-notch performances from James Coburn, Walter Matthau, and George Kennedy. Coburn and Kennedy are great as the mystery men from Charles' past, causing trouble and just being plain maniacal. The funeral scene, where the two of them are introduced, is hilarious and all involved are pitch-perfect. Matthau also does admirably playing against type, as I'm familiar with him, as a serious character. While his CIA administer Bartholemew has many instances of comic relief, it is his dramatic presence that really surprised me.Charade has it all: mystery, intrigue, romance, confusion, and an abundance of fun humor. Hepburn is radiant and sharp in her delivery, while Grant is comical and yet on a dime turns deathly stone-faced. The script is clever at most times, but never goes overboard to the absurd. I credit the actors and director Donen for steering it with enough reality to make us care for those involved in the plot. Unfortunately, it seems Demme decided to let his actors run loose in his adaptation, causing it to be a farcical retelling, making everything from the original that came close to being too much, fly right over the top. Charade needed to be grounded to succeed and that succeed is exactly what it did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best old films I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best suspense films I've ever seen. As a kid, I saw it a couple of times, and later bought it along with "The Truth About Charlie", the horrible Mark Wahlberg remake. I have seen 'Charlie' once. I have watched Charade 20-30 times. Charade keeps you guessing till the VERY last minute. A little more of a love story than I typically enjoy (I'm a GUY), but the story line carries it pretty well. Coburn, Grant, Hepburn, and Kennedy are fantastic. I think Walter Matthau makes the movie, though, as he plays an atypical part for himself. It's unusual to find humor and suspense woven together as it is in Charade. Toss in the love story, and it's really a unique film. Hepburn's flirting is a little annoying, but I understand that was Cary Grant's choice to be the 'pursued', rather than the pursuer. He thought it was a little creepy for an older man to chase a young girl. I think he was right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick and stylish - get ready to unmask "Charade"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charade is director Stanley Donen's masterful attempt to outdo Hitchcock in the department of big screen cinema suspense. To say that Donen succeeds on every level is an understatement. He excels! When Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) returns home from holiday she discovers that her fashionable Paris apartment has been cleaned out by her husband, Charles - who was a double agent, embezzled money from a trio of crooks (headed by James Coburn) and has been murdered. Into the thick of this mystery comes the savvy stranger with too many names, played by Cary Grant. Presenting himself as a friend and confident, Grant is determined to put Regina's mind at ease. But is he or isn't he working for the same men that killed her husband? Walter Matthau does serious, and rather convincingly in an uncharacteristically diabolical role that is particularly engaging.THE TRANSFER: I have a problem with Criterion charging an arm and a leg for their DVD's when so many of them come with little more than bare bones in the way of extra features. Their reissue of "Charade" is no exception. You may remember that this title was previously available from Criterion in a non-anamorphic transfer. That oversight has now been corrected. But although colors are exceptionally vibrant and sharp, there remains a considerable amount of edge enhancement and fine shimmering that is detected in horizontal and vertical details throughout the film. The audio is mono and nicely rendered.A more fitting transfer can be found on the flip side of Universal's "The Trouble With Charlie" a remake of Charade starring (oh, no!)Mark Walberg and Thandi Newton. Though this remake from Johnathan Demme is about as dismal and disturbing as going through a bikini wax, its one saving grace is that an impeccably rendered and 16X9 enhanced copy of the original film - "Charade" comes with it. Hence, the latter is well worth its $15 price tag.EXTRAS: On Criterion's edition only: An essay on the films of Stanley Donen and an audio commentary that is ? well, just ample as far as audio commentaries go.BOTTOM LINE: Universal has made "Charade" available as part of a double feature with its remake, the genuinely awful "The Truth About Charlie." However, for the difference in price, and because Universal's DVD is absent of digital all the digital anomalies I have already mentioned, that version is recommended over Criterions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never heard of this film before and was only lucky enough to come by it when it fell out of the Sunday newspaper. I wasn't prepared for a spy movie, so refreshingly and flat out brilliant, to come my way.The film stars Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn as 2 people who meet in Paris. The 2 leads do superbly well in their respective roles. The script is top notch, funny and suspenseful at the right times.You hear people quoting films like the godfather and Casablanca but this is chock full of witty, memorable lines. A favourite of mine being when Hepburn says to Grant, 'you know whats wrong with you?' He replies 'No', she says, 'Nothing.' This is probably more down to the 2 leads chemistry and their acting abilities, but its great stuff to watch.Audrey Hepburns husband has been murdered. Pretty soon it arises that her husband stole some money and 3 bad guys want it back. Cary Grants character also secretly wants it, though his intentions are for the most part unclear. He befriends Hepburn. Cue romance. The film has lots of twists and turns and people aren't who they say they are. Or are they? The movie is enjoyable to watch and superbly made. Great camera work, excellent acting and story surely make this THE underrated gem of the sixties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not only can you expect the unexpected...YOU SHOULD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the best part about "Charade" is that you can't figure out until the very end who is on which side. Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) is a Givenchy-clad UN translator whose husband has been murdered. In Paris, trying to find out who or what was behind the murder, she discovers that there was a part of her husband's past with which she was not familiar, relating to a group of men who want something. Among the men are Tex Panthollow (James Coburn), Herman Scobie (George Kennedy) and Cary Grant's character, a suave stranger who frequently changes his name. And H. Bartholomew (Walter Matthau) is even more intriguing still.One might compare "Charade" to another Cary Grant movie: "To Catch a Thief". Both movies are set-in-France mysteries in which Grant stars opposite a glamorous woman born in 1929. But I notice something else about "Charade": a series of patterns relating to the number 7. Bear with me.The word "charade" has seven letters. It was released in 1963, and 63 is 7 times 9. Cary Grant died in 1986, Audrey Hepburn in 1993, and Walter Matthau in 2000, all at seven year intervals. Interestingly enough, James Coburn died in 2002, so he broke the seven-year pattern (he also broke a pattern in the movie: he was the first character not wearing his pajamas when...well, I won't spoil it for you).Okay, I admit that that's probably all just a coincidence. More than anything, one can observe how hot Audrey Hepburn is. No matter what the camera angle is, this movie brought her to what may have been her most glamorous role. Sweet!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fascinating and Very Pleasing Romantic Noir Mystery; Delightful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henry Mancini's music and the lyrical title song are not the only virtues of the attractive production of "Charade". Stanley Donen, probably the best Alfred Hitchcock school-of director in the twentieth century, also mounted a film featuring beautiful sets, lovely costumes, very fine lighting, sound, cinematography and mush more. And the camera-work and blocking of the actors is extraordinary. But the strongest feature of the film is is intricate and logical storyline. The mysterious death of a young woman's husband makes her the target here of a trio of frightening types. She somehow enlists an enigmatic but attractive man she has met, who signs on to help her. But he proves to be as delusive, have as many false names and be more worrisome than was her mysterious husband, about whom she knew nothing. The four, along with her husband part of an army quartet that had stolen something valuable in WWII, want the item which her husband had stolen. The wife enlists a man from the American Embassy also; but she and the mystery man have to evade the nefarious trio, and try to trust one another; and finally she has to decide if the mystery man or the Embassy man is a killer, and which one will save her life and return the stolen item. Cary Grant does very well, despite being a bit too old to play the mystery man. Walter Matthau is effective as the Embassy man. The three villains are played energetically by James Coburn, intelligent Ned Glass and powerful George Kennedy, with a hook for a hand. There are wonderfully memorable scenes in the film such as a frightening first meeting with the bad trio in the funeral home where her husband is lying; a fight between Grant and Kennedy on the roof; a trip on a barge down the Seine; a hunt for the lost treasure; and a final confrontation in an empty theater. The slow growth of the romance between a reluctant-but-interested Grant and an eager by hesitant Audrey Hepburn as the bewildered wife works very well. This is a fine noir film, very colorful, and with tons of interesting and humorous dialogue. Highly recommended, and almost as good as its reputation says.</fullReview>

The music is romantic and fitting, and the chemistry between Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant is amazingly appealing. It has been said that Grant was troubled about the wide discrepancy between their ages and requested that she be the pursuer of romance instead of the other way around. This was a charming ploy coupled with the twist and turns of a genuinely suspenseful movie; it is absolutely my favorite movie of all time. The supporting cast which included younger Walter Matthau, George Kennedy and James Coburn were quite wonderful also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How not to do a DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got my first DVD player a couple of months back and am going through all the classic film DVDs my local video stores have. Not only are the prints great but I love the "extras"- the documentaries and the commentaries. I've just rented the DVD of Charade issued by Madacy and this seems a classic example of how not to do a DVD. The extras are a poor, 20 minute "biography" of Cary Grant that contains some inaccuracies and has the narrator droning on over grainy clips of "coming attractions" from his films. It commits the cardinal sin of saying that "North by Northwest" was Grant's "last important film". Then why rent this one, which was done four years later?It also has an insipid three question trivia quiz where, if you get the wrong answer, they show the scene of the water from the child's water pistol being squirted in Audrey's face and if you get it right you see a shot of a combo from the film playing something involving beating the drums. I was expecting production notes. Then there is the "Bonus Feature", a 1953 film also called "Charade" starring James Mason that has absolutely nothing to do with the decade-later film. How is any of this supposed to enhance your enjoyment of the movie? There are no commentaries, production notes, newsreels of the premiere, documentaries about THE FILM, etc. Nothing. Charade, indeed.My view of Charade itself is that it's THE classic romantic thriller. I like it better than North by Northwest. Hitchcock made some greater films, (especially "Rear Window", one of my all-time favorites), but even his romantic thrillers take a back seat to this romp. Later films have tried to match it but none of them do. Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn are the two most charming performers ever to be in the same film. How many performers today would you describe as "charming"? It's something that has virtually disappeared from the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Truth about Charade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Audrey Hepburn says to Cary Grant in 1963's CHARADE "You know what's wrong with you?...Absolutely nothing!", it is a great line because everyone watching knows that she is really talking about Cary Grant, not the character he is playing. When Thandie Newton says to Mark Wahlberg in THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE "You know what's wrong with you?...Absolutely nothing!", it is a relatively meaningless piece of dialogue, because, even though Wahlberg is apparently a nice guy and pretty good actor, he is no Cary Grant, and his character has done nothing to garner such praise. But then again, Newton is no Hepburn. And CHARLIE is certainly no CHARADE.CHARADE is one of the most pleasing pieces of fluff that Hollywood has ever made. Despite a notable body count and a few suspenseful moments, the film is really a romantic comedy. Despite its intricate plot of double crosses, fake identities and a mad search for some missing loot in a picture-postcard Paris, it is designed to amuse. It is Hitchcock-lite; as directed by Stanley Donen, a man best known for directing films like SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, the film also is constructed like a musical, stringing together a few remarkable set pieces with a silly plot and clever banter. But most of all, CHARADE is an excuse to pair up Grant and Hepburn, two experts in the field of romantic comedy. If ever a film were personality driven it is CHARADE, which sports not just pros Grant and Hepburn, but a batch of gifted character actors such as Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass. Nobody would ever mistake CHARADE for great filmmaking, but as sprightly comedy tinged with dark humor it is hard to beat.But for some inexplicable reason it was remade in 2002 as the rather blandly named THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE. I can only assume that the filmmakers realized that there was no way they could equal the wit and style of the original -- not to mention the difficulty in finding contemporary stars comparable to Hepburn and Grant -- so they opted to play the film more or less straight. That may have made sense if the plot of the original was anything to be taken seriously. But remaking a comedy-thriller as just a thriller and stripping it of its Hollywood gloss for a gritty realistic look really does not make a lot of sense. Add to that some ill-conceived politically correct updating -- a dash of lesbianism, a bit of feminism (the police detective is now a woman) and a multiethnic cast -- and the style and the content of the film seem mismatched. Jonathan Demme, a director who once showed a knack for making light and quirky comedies like HANDLE WITH CARE and MELVIN AND HOWARD, now makes mostly dark and dreary dramas like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. He has become a "serious" filmmaker in the worst sense of the word.The film might still have been above average with proper casting, but the best that can be said for Wahlberg and Newton is that they are okay, but they never come off as a romantic couple. Certainly the sparkling chemistry of Grant and Hepburn is missing, but then the film never even tried for that tone in the first place. Only Tim Robbins, taking on the Walter Matthau role, seems to remember that the source material for the film was a comedy.As is, CHARLIE is a perfectly competent and perfectly forgettable little thriller. But that is not enough to make it anything more than just a dour stepchild of a minor classic.</fullReview>

I especially like the scene where Audrey meets Cary for the first time and they have this very flirtatious repartee. It's very sexy, yet totally innocent on the surface. But it clearly establishes their relationship in a way that is essential to the plot.Today's screenwriters seem incapable of writing this sort of thing anymore. I have not seen the recent remake of Charade, but I know the reviews were bad. I would be willing to guess that the flirting in the first film was replaced by a lot of gratuitous sex. Sex is fine in context, but not if it comes at the expense of character development and plot, which I suspect was the case, as it is in almost every movie made today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slick, sophisticated and extremely charming are the most widely used adjectives to describe Stanley Donen's CHARADE; and this career highlight is still a great testament to his talent, particularly in view of the Jonathan Demme remake 40 years later. Getting the right doses of romance, comedy and thrills into one picture is difficult enough, but the mixture here is nothing short of miraculous. The funeral scene is witty beyond words. Stylish flourishes abound, making even the individual elements of the film outstanding: the animated Maurice Binder titles driven by Mancini's exceptional theme music; the Paris locations and production design; Peter Stone's slyly written banter; a cast of extraordinary character players; and even Ms. Hepburn's hip Givenchy wardrobe. Donen, Grant and Hepburn really deliver and CHARADE, as light and satisfying as it all is, is something of a minor cinema masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charade: A stylish cat-and-mouse game of life and/or death!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Charade" ranks as one of the best non-Hitchcock films to come out of the suspense genre. Audrey Hepburn is simply marvelous as Regina 'Reggie' Lampert, a young woman, who upon finding out that her husband was killed on a European train, later discovers that three men (with whom he was once acquainted) are after a hidden fortune they believe that she has access to. The men (played by George Kennedy, James Coburn and Ned Glass) ransack her apartment and send her threatening messages via telephone, causing her to seek help from Peter Joshua (Cary Grant), a seemingly helpful man with whom Reggie soon falls in love with. However, an official by the name of Bartholomew (Walter Matthau, in one of his early noteworthy performances) also offers to aid Reggie in helping to recover what the men are looking for -- a large sum of money that he pilfered with them after WWII. The usual cat-and-mouse formula follows, but with Stanley Donen's captivating direction and Henry Mancini's breathless score, this film is anchored far above the standards of regular suspense-filled hokum. Key scenes include Coburn and Hepburn's 'fiery' confrontation in the telephone booth, Grant chasing Hepburn through the subway station, the climax between Grant, Hepburn and Matthau in the theater, and the conclusion (Grant probably has more alias' in this film that any other character in film history!). A witty and urbane romance-thriller with class that truly delivers. This is one film that dosen't have to just rely on 'star power' to keep it going. Let's see if Johnathan Demme's 2002 remake, The Truth About Charlie, can match the magic of Charade (thought I highly doubt it). ***1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is astonishingly entertaining, one of those movies thats so fun to watch that you admire its energy as much as its great music or acting. The acting and cast is superb, with Cary Grant in a role perfect for him. The plot is out of a Hitchcock script, and it feels that way in ever scene. The dialouge is crisp and snappy, with some very memorable lines. The music, by Mancini, is a classic. If you want a soild, entertaining film with something for anyone with eyes this movie is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very entertaining film, but with Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant, how could it be otherwise? By the way, there's nothing wrong with Donen making a suspense film. Alfred Hitchcock did not own the genre, except figuratively. And the suspense elements of the movie were well-done, but not quite up to AH standards. But those are high standards, indeed. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Some of the plot twists, I did not see coming. But with the Matthau character, I just knew that there was more than met the eye. In any case, this is a film to add to one's collection. Grade: A</fullReview>

This movie is an excellent example of why many movies from this time period still seem fresh today. The dialogue is witty and the comebacks fly thick and fast. The plot twists are enough to keep the story interesting but not to the point of being overdone or confusing. Without the special effects of many of the overblown, big budget pictures of today, this film has a spirit, humor, and is done with enough class to deserve a high 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, so it's Hitchcockian. Enough already.The story of this film is wonderful. Sure, while everybody gets distracted by watching Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn cavorting happily through Paris (and very distracting they are), the story of this film really deserves more credit than it gets. The location of the hidden money is very clever, all the more so for being right under everyone's nose all along (including the audience). In addition to an intriguing story filled with colorful characters, this film is also packed with terrific dialogue of the "witty banter" variety. This contributes enormously to the film's charm, which, other than its stars, is its most bankable asset. No wonder it is so well-regarded.I'm frankly puzzled by people who seem to resent the fact that this film is compared to Hitchcock. As though anyone attempting to imitate Hitchcock must be, by definition, a fawning little hack. Stanley Donen is no hack, and he wasn't fawning. He realized that Hitchcock was monopolizing a genre he didn't invent, and thought "Why should he be the only person allowed to make such films?" Now, Donen doesn't have the reputation Hitchcock has, which is understandable enough. When compared to films like "Rear Window" or "Vertigo", "Charade" looks rather slight and unimportant. But it stands toe-to-toe with a film like "North by Northwest", and is stronger, I'd say, than "Notorious" or "Strangers on a Train", just to pick out a few examples. The blending of comedy, romance, and suspense is a difficult one to pull off, and Hitchcock didn't always get it right. "Charade" does. The only complaint I have is a small plot detail. Granted that Cruikshank must adopt a false identity for the purpose of a) deceiving the "Marx brothers" and b) finding out whether or not Reggie is involved, he gives Reggie one or two more false identities than he has to. He tells her he's Peter Joshua, then that he's Alexander Dyle, fine. But by the time his Dyle persona is blown apart, she already trusts him for the most part (as evidenced by the ease with which she accepts his rather thin story about being a thief), so why not just tell her the truth? But it's a small flaw, and it doesn't do anything at all to undermine the enjoyment one takes in this lovely and endlessly watchable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1st watched 1/27/2002 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Stanley Donen): Whimsical, well-made twisted plot of a movie. Grant &amp; Hepburn are wonderful as a couple involved in this twisted plot that starts with Hepburn's husband being killed and running across Grant quite by accident(not really). Grant really showed up for a reason, but to tell you too much about the reason would ruin the movie for everyone. This movie has well-done character roles played by many young actors who end up with leading roles later in their careers.(Walter Matthau, James Coburn, and George Kennedy). Everyone plays their parts a little tongue-in-cheek despite the seriousness of the situation which makes the movie very watchable. This (to me) is a very overlooked classic by director Stanley Donen and deserves a look by many more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Audrey Hepburn glows. Cary Grant oozes charm, as always.This is probably my very favorite Grant movie, and my favorite Hepburn movie as well. She's bewildered, he's charming, and neither of them has been quite who they really are, but at least they're not Meg Ryan and ______ ________ (fill in the blanks here). I'm so sorry Hollywood doesn't turn out light, amusing little pieces like this anymore; they really should.Finally, a movie that's clever without being ingenuous, twisty without being ridiculous, and funny without having a laugh track. I don't like being told when to laugh. Admittedly, the humor in "Charade" is fairly subtle. I laughed my brains out during the orange scene, and even the bit with the matches has its sadistic charm. The leads make a beautiful couple with beautiful voices, and the whole thing comes off as a sideswipe at Hitchcock: not precisely a parody, not precisely a homage, and definitely not a pale imitation.Rent it. The groovy music and titles at the beginning are only the beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pale attempt to mimic those light romantic Hitchcock thrillers "North By Northwest" and "To Catch a Thief" with an intriguing tale full of twists and turns.Unlike the films that this tries to emulate, this one has a lot of heavy-handed attempts at humour. Unfortunately these are very clumsy and most of the jokes fall flat. Most (although not all) of the plot twists are predictable, and the casting of such familiar actors as George Kennedy, Walter Matthau and James Coburn was a big mistake in a Paris-set film. They seem out of place and don't fit the film at all.Audrey Hepburn mainly manages to transcend the thin script, though Grant generally comes off looking ill-at-ease, and in his comedy scenes he seems goofy and immature. The two do have great chemistry together, but in a warm uncle-niece kind of way, so the heavily emphasised romantic angle seems awkward and very forced.Criticisms aside, this is an entertaining film. The plot is reasonably engaging, and Audrey's character is appealing.Locations and cinematography are excellent.</fullReview>

Wonderful vignettes stay in the mind - the lift and the stairs around it, replete with fussy wrought iron; the body in the bathtub; the scene under the stage, the stamp market -- Stanley Donen excelling himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant Sparkle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As anyone with even a minimum of experience in the real world can attest, life often has a way of taking an unexpected turn that in an instant can turn an uncluttered existence into veritable turmoil, which is exactly what happens in `Charade,' a mystery with romantic and comedic overtones, directed by Stanley Donen and starring Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant. An American living in Paris, unaware of her husband's covert activities and associations, Regina `Reggie' Lampert (Hepburn) is informed upon returning home from vacationing at a ski resort that her husband (whom she was about to divorce) has died, having been thrown from a train en route to a destination (unbeknownst to her) that would ultimately have taken him to South America. Suddenly widowed and without resources, Reggie quickly finds herself surrounded by murder and mystery as the strange secret life of her husband slowly comes to light, and she finds herself the target of some unfinished business that has to do with her husband's clandestine associates. But as luck would have it, this damsel in distress is befriended by a stranger, Peter Joshua (Grant), a man with whom she had a momentary encounter during her vacation at the resort. Together, they attempt to assemble the pieces of the discomfiting puzzle that has become her life, in order to get her back on track. It's a tall order, however, and like the man said at one time or another, `Nobody said life was going to be easy.' Along the way Reggie also discovers some things about her knight in shining armor that adds yet another perspective to the conundrum into which she has inexplicably fallen. And she begins to wonder if anything in the world is actually the way it seems. Working from an excellent screenplay by Peter Stone, and backed by a terrific score and that familiar theme by Henry Mancini, Donen invades Hitchcock territory to weave a web of intrigue and suspense that, while it lacks the nuance and that special touch that Hitchcock always managed to bring to this kind of material, will keep you guessing until the very end. The overall film has a decided `60s Cinema' look and feel that virtually defines it, and while this isn't a bad thing, the presentation as such has a way of keeping the viewer at arm's length and prevents the kind of emotional involvement that would've made this a riveting film. Suffice to say that, comparatively, it lacks the realism that you find in more recent offerings of this genre. What it definitely has in it's favor is the great cast, and especially the stars, Hepburn and Grant. Audrey Hepburn is lovely as Reggie, bringing a knowing, yet innocent quality to the character. Charismatic as always, and imbued with that natural, refined beauty that is her trademark, she epitomizes the sensibilities of the era with a waif-like consistency and bearing that makes her a joy to watch. She has a radiant screen presence, and seeing her in this place and time makes it easy to understand all of the things that truly made her a movie star as well as an accomplished actor.  Grant, of course, is charming as usual, slipping into his character with facility and creating an instant chemistry with Hepburn that makes this story come alive. His performance is smooth and believable, and his easy, yet commanding presence leaves no doubt that he is in control, even when faced with some formidable opponents and situations. He conveys something of an invincibility in this role that lets you know that no matter how dark things get, all will be well by the end. After all the twists and turns, you feel relatively certain that if they stick together, Reggie and Peter are going to land on their feet. But then again, this is a `Charade,' isn't it? The supporting cast includes James Coburn (Tex), Walter Matthau (Bartholomew), George Kennedy (Herman), Dominique Minot (Sylvie), Ned Glass (Leopold), Jacques Marin (Inspector Grandpierre), Paul Bonifas (Mr. Felix) and Thomas Chelimsky (Jean-Louis). An entertaining film that has a place of it's own in Cinematic History, `Charade' affords the opportunity of seeing two of the giants of the silver screen together, doing what they do best: Making magic. Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant are stars of rare magnitude, and together they make the screen sparkle. And it's no charade. It's the magic of the movies. I rate this one 8/10. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not surprising that people mistake it for a Hitchcock film, but I would dare to say it's actually better in many ways than most of his works. There's the same subtle sophistication that Hitch achieved in many of his color works, but it's coupled with a potent sexiness lacking in his movies. It's all the more impressive considering Grant's age at the time.True, the symbolism in the film is nowhere near as subtle as Hitchcock's, but it's just plain fun from start to finish. The Mauritius Penny, Hawaiian Blue and other stamps just have to be a nod to "The Purloined Letter." The succession of names Grant goes through in his ongoing charade: Peter Joshua, Alexander Dyle, Adam Canfield, and the rest. Classic and classy.

Ordinarily Grant never allowed himself to be filmed with his gray hair exposed, however in this production he allowed himself to be natural. Hepburn is just one of the all-time greats of the movies. A lithe waife of a woman she exudes marvelous style, grace, and sex appeal. James Coburn, Walter Matheau, and George Kennedy help round out the cast and play their roles with typical expertise and aplomb. Charade is one of my very favorites and it'll be yours too.</fullReview>

A very feminine Audrey Hepburn and her overtures to Cary Grant present intelligent but romantic humour.

		<fullReview>I loved this movie becuase even though it is suspense thriller, it's got some good humour, such as Cary Grant's dressed up shower scene, and romance. The first sequence, which a guy falls out of the train, gave me a strong impression and the music was also great. However, the reason that it is worth seeing is Audrey Hepburn. Like other her movies, she is very enchanting and elegant that the audience has to love her. Also, despite the age difference, she seems perfect with paring up with Cary Grant. This movie is a kind of mixture of Hichcock and James Bond but much better than those two. I wonder why this movie is not as acclaimed as other Hepburn films, Sabrina and Breakfast at Tiffany's. Among Roman Holiday and Funny Face, this is my favourite Audrey Hepburn film.</fullReview>

Overlooked is an excellent performance by the late Walter Matthau, often thought of in comedic roles but showing his strength in drama as well.

		<shortDescription>'Charade' Sparkles with the Vigor of Freshly Uncorked Champagne!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charade is often hailed as "the best Hitchcock film that Hitchcock never got around to making", sometimes thought of in terms of ersatz Hitchcock, and that's understandable. But in hindsight, it really does director Stanley Donen a disservice because he brings into Charade a lot of flair and chutzpah, resulting in a delightful mystery-cum-romance that sparkles with all the vigor of freshly uncorked champagne.The stunningly playful opening credits designed by Maurice Binder places you right amidst the snow- capped mountains of the French Alps, where we see our leading lady Reggie Lambert enjoying a ski trip. She soon returns to Paris to find her house ransacked and her husband dead. His funeral is attended by three curious thugs, each of whom makes sure that the corpse is indeed dead. Peter Joshua, a handsome pickup acquaintance from her vacation, comforts Reggie and offers his assistance, as does CIA man Bartholomew who informs her that her husband was part of a gang which, during World War II, stole and stashed a quarter of a million dollars. Naturally, everyone thinks ? mistakenly - that Reggie knows the whereabouts of the money. Meanwhile, Reggie finds herself falling in love with Peter, although she suspects that he too is after the money, especially given his fondness for aliases ? first Peter Joshua, then Alexander Dyle, the deceased's heart stricken brother, later as professional thief Adam Canfield, and still later as Brian Cruikshank. The gullible Reggie can't help being befuddled. As the corpses begin to accumulate, it becomes increasingly important - and difficult - for Reggie to determine who the good guys are and who are the villains.Charade plays out as a slick, stylish thriller, with great on location shots and a chic Henry Mancini score, humming along in a breezy entertaining way with plenty of charm. But the film owes its reputation largely to the crackling repartee between its leading stars - the always elegant 32-year-old Audrey Hepburn and the always charismatic 60-year-old Cary Grant. Grant always had a bit of a dark side, a sinister center to his suave humor, that helps him out here as he plays different variations of essentially the same character. We only ever know as much as Hepburn does, and we're never sure we can trust him. It's a great performance. The luminous Hepburn is equally fabulous as she plays the damsel in distress, without giving into the clichés associated with such a character. The sexual chemistry between them, when set against Charade's tumultuous backdrop of shifting identities, makes this movie an enduring favorite.After all these years, Charade still remains the real deal, not some cheap, exploding cheeseburger of a movie pretender. Charade reminds us that when all the elements come together, it's possible for Hollywood to make a flawless entertainment that thoroughly whisks us away. Too bad it doesn't happen more often.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How is this not bigger than it is???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best suspense movies ever that was not directed by Hitchcock and the only screen pairing of Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. That alone should have made it one of the most famous movies ever. I only stumbled across it by accident on Amazon and I am very glad I did. Walter Matthau as the spy and especially George Kennedy as one of the four "bad guys" really steal every scene they're in. But Cary Grant as the good guy who we never are quite sure about until the end, and Audrey Hepburn as the young widow absolutely blow everyone else away. Their chemistry practically crackles in the air and the ending especially is one of the most suspenseful, yet tastefully structured of any classic film. This film gets and A in my book and is well worth taking the time to seek out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suspense movies don't get any better than this one. A great cast lead by Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn with an excellent supporting cast. Hepburn is married to a man who turns out to be a thief from WWII. Along with four other OSS agents that were suppose to deliver $250K in gold to the French underground. They buried it instead and reported it stolen by the Nazi's during an ambush. Hepburn's husband doesn't wait for the rest but steals it first. So the remaining three show up after her husband is murdered trying to leave. There are only three left because Grant's brother (?) was one of the five but he is dead. There is some nice word play about spies/agents between Matthau (supposedly a CIA desk jockey) and Hepburn. Grant is superb as the suave, urbane, witty, older man to the rescue or is he?? There appears to be another player in the game as the three OSS thieves start getting killed off one by one. Turns out there is no brother, Grant confesses he is actually a thief (or is he?) and is trying for the gold also. Every time Grant is caught in one of his lies about his name and who or what he is/does he comes up with another name and occupation. Since this film was made in 1963 it only follows that the Hepburn must fall for the much older Grant but he does a role reversal and plays hard to get. Things start coming to a head as the nears it's end, of course it has too after all. It seems that the gold got converted into three very valuable stamps and are hidden on an envelope. This has been given to Hepburn's nephew and he trades them to a stamp collector for a whole bunch of worthless stamps. This guy turn out to be a rare thing, an honest man. He gives the stamps back to her. Thinking Grant is the killer and is now after her she calls Matthau and they are to meet. Grant and her pass in the hotel. He follows her to the train station where she ends up calling the US embassy. Here is where we find out that it has been Matthau all along who is the real bad guy. He is the fifth man that was left behind to die and is the killer and is now after the stamps. So now there is the chase scene only it is on foot. The chase ends up in an empty theater. There is a clever ending in the theater when Grant drops Matthau through a trap door ending his involvement. At the very end Grant is a treasury agent and has been trying to recover the loot. The two of them go off into the future to get married and live happily ever after.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought I had seen virtually every good movie from the 60's but this slipped under my radar somehow. Very good, as mentioned by others it's very reminiscent of something Hitchcock may do, like "North By Northwest." Quite a few twists and turns in the plot, although I did figure out who the killer was. Plus a couple other surprises at the end. Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn work well together, although Grant was beginning to finally show his age, I believe this was one of his last films. Fine supporting cast, James Coburn, George Kennedy and the always entertaining Walter Mathau. Good location shots of Paris, from 50 years ago. Nice musical score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thriller that is tense, amusing and romantic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Mrs Regina Lampert returns to her home in Paris planning to ask her husband for a divorce she is in for a surprise; the apartment is bare and the police inform her that he has been murdered! At the funeral three strangers turn up; take a look at the body then leave; it soon becomes apparent that her husband was not the man she thought he was. She is contacted by one Hamilton Bartholomew of the CIA who tells her that her husband and the three other men were responsible for the theft of a quarter of a million dollars worth of gold, which was intended for the French resistance during the war. It looks as if her husband had tried to steal it from his co-conspirators and now they believe she must have it... except she has no idea where it could be. Shortly afterwards a man she met on holiday turns up at her apartment and offers to help her... although it soon becomes apparent that he knows the three men from the funeral and they are all after the money. In what follows suspicions about where the money is and who has it constantly change as the crooks distrust each other while trying to get Regina to tell them what she knows. Tension rises as one by one those looking for the money end up dead leaving Regina convinced she is in danger from the man she thought she could trust.This film may be almost fifty years old but it is still fresh due to a fine story and a great cast. Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant are perfectly cast in the central roles of Regina and the man she knows as Peter Joshua; there is a real chemistry between them. They are ably supported by a well known cast that includes Walter Matthau, James Coburn and George Kennedy. For a film with such a light touch and plenty of humour it is surprisingly tense; in particular the scene where 'Peter' fights the claw-handed Herman Scobie (George Kennedy) on the roof of a tall Parisian building and the final scenes where Regina fleas through the Paris Metro leading to a final confrontation with the killer. There are plenty of twists through out the film as characters switch from good to bad and sometimes back again... there is even a twist in the post confrontation epilogue! Definitely worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charade (1963)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It takes a lot for a film to automatically jump into your favorites of all time. Charade is one of those rare films that did just that. Unfortunately ignored, mostly due to copyright mistakes made by the production company, this has been dubbed "The greatest Hitchcock film Hitchcock never made". It's certainly true that this owes a lot to the works of Hitchcock. Despite not adding much originality to the genre, it perfects every single facet. Charade is a classical romantic-comedy disguised as a spy thriller. The first noticeable sign that this is going to be brilliant is the witty and quick dialogue. Most comedies today don't generate so many belly laughs. This is a serious world, filled with real people. This means that everyone has a slight sense of humor, and interesting character quirks. The film also works by making Hepburn more of a predator than her older leading man. Her character is given much to work with as a woman looking for divorce, before discovering her husband has been murdered. A great thing about this film is that it has so many twists, and you only see them approaching seconds before the reveal. This film kept me guessing, excited, smiling, and intrigued. An absolute gem from when Hollywood crafted masterpieces.</fullReview>

Does anyone notice the same melody?The themes of the songs seem similar. A number of artists have sung "Masquerade",and just wondered whether there was written anything about the similarities of the two? I enjoy watching these "old" wonderful movies, and took a film class in college, where we were make aware of the magic of cinematography compared with films such as Stanley Kubrick's "A Space Odyssey. 2001"D.H.Lawrence's "Women In Love".

		<shortDescription>Charade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very reminiscent of a Hitchcock film, Charade is a sophisticated comedy/thriller/mystery staring Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn.The film stars the sparkling, unbeatable talents of Audrey Hepburn as a newly widowed American in Paris who is pursued by a trio of thugs looking to recover a fortune stolen by her late husband, and Cary Grant as the mysterious stranger who steps in to protect her. But who is he really? I mean Cary Grant can't be a bad guy. Or can he? Well, in in the course of the picture, Grant poses, as a businessman, the revenge-seeking brother of one of the bad guys' victims and a professional thief who's also after the stolen money. Each time Hepburn catches him in a lie, he simply comes up with a new name and occupation. "The man's the same even if the name is different," he assures her. Who can she trust? Suspense, intrigue, murder and the screen presence of both stars make this a must see film. Grant and Hepburn are just magical on screen together. The chemistry between these two stars is a timeless thrill to watch and it is also the sad but true fact that there are no stars like these anymore. I mean come on- could you imagine any stars today who can deliver such lines as "You know what's wrong with you? Absolutely nothing!" I think my favorite scene from the entire film is the one with Audrey Hepburn, in disguise trying to trail Cary Grant. It is just hilarious and Hepburn is absolutely adorable. That scene at the end, where it is revealed who Cary Grant really is, simply priceless. That face he makes! :worthy: :worthy: I also loved that whole rooftop fight with George Kennedy he had.James Coburn, Walter Matthau, George Kennedy and Ned Glass co-star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Audrey Hepburn In A Mystery Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charade (1963): Audrey Hepburn, Cary Grant, Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy, Jacques Marin, Dominique Minot, Thomas Chelimsky, Paul Bonifas, Gregoire Aslan, Claudine Berg, Marcel Bernier, Raoul Delfosse, Colin Drake, Bernard Musson, Jacques Preboist, Stanley Donen, Peter Stone, Monte Landis, Clement Harari, Michael Thomass, Roger Trapp......Director Stanley Donen, Screenplay Peter Stone."Oh I love you Peter, Alexander, Joshua whatever your name is, I love you"..................Director Stanely Donen's "Charade" (Universal, 1963)stars Audrey Hepburn, at the time she was also in the process of doing "My Fair Lady" for Warner Bros. She was a big star at this time and had already appeared in "Breakfast At Tiffany's" - her iconic performance. This film finds her in a role that is not that impressive nor character-heavy. She portrays Regina Lampert the wife of a husband who is killed as the film opens. As an investigation ensues, she discovers that her husband, who was fabulously wealthy, had stolen money from the American government and had been a CIA man. Walter Matthau portrays Hamilton Bartholomew, who is supposedly on her side and whom she trusts. Regina discovers that three men are after the money her husband left and have threatened to kill her, thinking she is in possession of the money. Cary Grant's character is a man with many names who is also lying to Regina and whom we mistakenly believe is also after her money. Deception, lies, murder, CIA, are all elements in this mystery thriller which also pretends to be a romance. Cary Grant, no longer the young and handsome talent he had once been, is still charming and very funny. But the romance element is hardly the focus in this film. For fans of movies of Audrey Hepburn, you'll find that this one is not entirely romantic and some parts appear to have been inspired by the popular "pulp fiction" movies of the time. At times, owing to the music by Henry Mancini such as the opening credits music, the film has the feel of a James Bond movie. Add to that a girl running for her life, three dangerous men (one with a hook for a hand) and Cary Grant's debonair role and you do feel this is a James Bond movie. But what we have here is a mix of romantic comedy and thriller, almost as if it is poking fun of the thriller and mystery genre. I've loved Audrey Hepburn movies in the past and she is clearly comfortable in various types of films but this one is too much of an attempt to appear in a genre that is not suited to her. The best performances here are neither Grant and Hepburn who try to do romantic comedy in an otherwise bleak murder setting. Walter Matthau is a two-faced guy, who does it without even looking truly murderous, is the strongest performance, followed by James Coburn and George Kennedy. Filmed on location in Paris, with Charles Lang's usually excellent cinematography, and Givenchy's beautiful and chic wardrobes, this is a movie that is good and at the same time bad. I didn't care for the script and the comedy, considered old fashioned and early 60's inside jokes, can be lost to modern audiences. At times you don't know what this movie is trying to be. It's not the type of romance Hepburn did in "Funny Face" or "Breakfast At Tiffany's". It's Audrey Hepburn doing a film with mystery and thriller elements which was becoming more and more popular throughout the 60's. The romantic comedy elements are written into the dialogue mostly. Certain scenes are very "60's". For instance, the nightclub "orange" game in which couples pass an orange using their bodies and not using their hands has strong sexual innuendo, a sign of the more sexually liberated times of the 60's. The ending is abrupt and rather unusual and the romance happens far too quickly. But if you like Audrey Hepburn movies and if you like Cary Grant, this is the one film they did together and Charade has always had some appeal and fame, considered to be a classic.</fullReview>

But you must realize we are pointing this out only after seeing him for do many years in extremely funny films (especialy those films with Jack Lemmon).Perhaps the powers to be were impressed with him and wanted to utilize him in a very important vehicle as this film appears to have been. The main thing is to sit back and enjoy this very classic film.

		<fullReview>For me this is my favorite film of all time. Cary Grant &amp; Audrey Hepburn are my two favorite actors. This film has everything in it that one looks for. It has intrigue, comedy, plot twists, romance. Cary Grant keeps changing his identity so you don't really find out who he is until the very last scene. Audrey Hepburn (Reggie Lampert) turns hot &amp; cold with him as he changes his identities. Thrown into this mix is a French police inspector who is trying himself to find out who killed Reggie's husband. Then everyone is after the quarter million dollars in gold that no one can figure out where it is until the end. And therein lies the big mystery - where is all that money? And who is doing all the killing as dead bodies keep piling up? All the constantly changing identities and scheming that Cary Grant pulls off just makes Reggie that more attracted to him. And he isn't the only one lying about his identity. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best way to start a review of "Charade" is to ask "What's not to like"? The movie is a very smart and engaging murder mystery. One of the most physically gorgeous women ever (at least to male audiences), Audrey Hepburn, finds out more and more about her dead husband, including his real name. She encounters Cary Grant early, and they hit it off with lines that are so classic in their appeal, that most later movies tried to emulate them. Add to this you have two of the greatest giants ever leading an all star cast, and you have everything going for it. The scenes smartly go from different emotions with smart segues. You have humor, suspense, romance, intrigue, mystery, action. You've got it all. So many ingredients make this even better than a great movie. And to top it off, easily the most creative and best movie death scene ever in any movie makes this a "must see".</fullReview>

Everything about this movie is just cool...in an old fashion cutting edge sorta way. This movie has it all, suspense, comedy and an interesting story line.

		<fullReview>I just can't help but think of Hitchcock when watching this film. The secretive plot, the twists and turns, its all there.Following the death of Regina Lampert's (Audrey Hebpurn) husband, she find out that he had stolen some 250,000 $ from the government and they want it back. She is also suddenly approached by a man by the name of Peter Joshua who seems to be offering her a helping hand. At the same time however, a group of men are trying to get to her to get that stolen money, which they believe she has. Lampert, who was unaware of her husband's dubious past, must now play a dangerous game of cat and mouse, not knowing who to trust since hardly anyone seems to be who they say they are.Directed by Stanley Donen, this film is very reminiscent of Hitchcock. However it can still stand out by itself. What really amped up the interested was how every development in the story brought about a twist or turn that made you think, who is who and who can you trust. The beautiful Hebpurn plays her role superbly and along with Grant, forms a formidable and interesting duo.A fine film, well worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Mix of Mystery , Romance and Light Humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Charade" is a wonderful and most enjoyable film. With a plot that includes mysterious murders as a background it has a romantic story and humor too.Action takes place in Paris and Stanley Donnen's direction achieves a most entertaining product aided by a very good cast with Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn in the leading roles. Hepburn gives a very good performance as the menaced widow that doesn't know why she is being menaced (at first at least). Cary Grant is as good and convincing as usual as the man that tries to help her and while at it they fall in love; though Grant was much older than Hepburn and this worried him a lot when they told him who the leading lady would be (in fact he tried Hepburn to be replaced), the difference doesn't really notice on the screen and they show a real chemistry between them that makes them a good match.The rest of the cast is most accurate. Walter Matthau is at his best as a member of the American legacy that also gets involved in the case. George Kennedy, James Coburn and Ned Glass are the villains that threaten Hepburn.If not regarding Grant and Hepburn's future, the ending of the film doesn't lack a surprising twist regarding the mysterious murders and the solution of the plot.An excellent film most complete and enjoyable as a thriller, a light comedy or a romantic film. Make your choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The script picks this film up and just carries it the entire distance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one thing that this film really has going for it the entire time is, indeed, the script. Never once does it let itself down and never once does it shy away from what it should be doing. The script has a certain degree of cynicism in it and this adds to the comedy throughout. After the early exchanges and dialogue, it could've gone done a slightly different route and taken a more serious approach but it didn't and credit where credit's due because it stuck to its guns. Everything is quick and witty and this is blended it with a very interesting and mysterious atmosphere which really works well.Often the film will make you laugh and there are simply too many one-liners and jokes within the dialogue to list. This works well in juxtaposition with the air of mystery and murder also contained throughout. People may be dying rather gruesome and unpleasant deaths throughout but the fact 'they all died in their pyjamas' is a fantastic example that you shouldn't really take it too seriously. In fact, it's like the film is actually ashamed of being too graphic and too serious, but it works in its own little unique way. The music also adds to this experience as it's often rather dark and foreboding and to me, it sounded a little ahead of its time.What's also interesting is the setting. We really do see both sides of the city of Paris in this film. You have grotty hotels and dank little streets but there's also the element of romance thrown in amongst a wonderful boat ride scene. This is ultimately a hint as to the love interest forming between the two of them from one characters point of view, at least. Also; the dialogue, bizarrely enough, actually echoes when the scene is taken under a bridge via the boat ride even though it doesn't LOOK like they're on location. It was a nice touch, anyway.The story clearly plays second fiddle to the script as Grant's character takes on so many different aliases; it's close to impossible to keep up on a first viewing. The fact that all of the characters whom are 'at war' with one another within the narrative are all within a few feet of one another pretty much throughout the film is another odd thing about this film but it doesn't detract too much.A final thought is the scene where the child asks James Coburn's character 'if he's a real cowboy' or not. A rather quaint little 'nod' to 'The Magnificent Seven' from three years earlier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I do not think this movie is good enough to make the IMDb top 250, it still is an excellent movie that is a lot of fun. I think some of the reason it is rated highly is because there seems to be an "Audrey Hepburn cult"---a devoted group of people who see her as the greatest actress that ever lived and her movies as masterpieces. While I would admit she was a heck of an actress, I just don't think BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S, ROMAN HOLIDAY or CHARADE are great--just very good and entertaining.The film automatically is guaranteed to be very good just because of its pairing of Hepburn and Cary Grant. Both are such professional and likable actors that it's no surprise at all that the movie succeeds. And while Cary is significantly older than his co-star, this is handled pretty well in the movie. The older Cary isn't as sure of himself or tough as he once was and he even makes a few remarks about his advancing age. This is a very graceful way of making the pairing actually work. About the only aspect of the pairing I didn't care for was how many times Cary turned out to be someone else. Considering how often he lied to Audrey, it didn't make much sense for her STILL to fall in love with him. This does prevent the movie from scoring a higher rating from me, but it is a relatively small quibble since the rest of the film works so well.The supporting cast is exceptional--particularly George Kennedy as the hot-head. The writing decent and direction superb. In particular, the exceptional camera-work result and music resulted in a wonderful romantic mood and the director worked with his crew to ensure this. Also I was impressed by the scenes where the two would-be lovers were on the barge having a romantic dinner. I noticed that they actually worked with the sound to make it sound as if the barge was actually going under the bridges--with Grant's and Hepburn's voices echoing realistically to this. That's an excellent touch that many directors would NOT have included. It was obvious that this was a work of love.So fans of the two stars as well as fans of romance should enjoy this film very much. About the only ones who might not like CHARADE are action-loving teens and kids who might just think the whole thing is "icky" and can't understand why Ms. Hepburn would fall for "that old guy"--if only they knew and understood!</fullReview>

Though I do not think either of them have their best performances in this film, the sheer fact of them acting together bounces this to the top of my list.Now, last night as I watched this, I suddenly realized for the first time how intensely comic this is. Of course, the shower scene, among others, provides for laughs. However, now I'm realizing that almost the entire script is extremely tongue in cheek. With lines like "Maybe he'll meet his hand in the afterlife," how can one deny it? And Hepburn's repeated proclamations of love for Grant...Well, anyway, I think this is great, and one of only two films I was surprised to find out were NOT directed by Hitchcock. The other was The Prize, and that, my friends, is a completely different story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm an English teacher and I, like a dork, prefer reading to watching movies. That said, watching "Charade" is pure pleasure, even for me.This is one of the best movies EVER. Someone once said, and I'm paraphrasing, that it's the best Hitchcock movie that Hitchcock never made. I love the score, the plot, the characters...Walter Matthau as the bad guy? Wow! By the way, PLEASE do not pay a lot for this DVD. I've seen it advertised online for up to 28 dollars. I got it from the Dollar Tree for (you guessed it) one dollar!!!!! Does anyone know if the book on which the film is based is still in print? I'd love to compare them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That line ends Charade, the only movie with my two favorite actors starring together. That line is clever, a bit suspicion-provoking, and funny. Bottom line, it reflects this film. This film has Hitchcock all over it, yet, it is a comedy in many ways. Think of Cary Grant with all his clothes on in the shower, Audrey Hepburn's witty little lines, think of everything. This is a movie to savor, especially since it stars Cary Grant, whose accent is almost enough to watch any movie, except for "Affair to Remember" which I hate with a passion.But that will be another review.

		<fullReview>Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn were the two biggest names in lights in 1963 when they starred for the first and only time in Stanley Donen's (Singin' in the Rain, Blame it on Rio) Charade. The two stars do not disappoint as Hepburn and Grant take us all over the streets, rooftops and subways of Paris trying to get to the bottom of a missing/stolen $250,000 of OSS/CIA World War II loot. Not only is this movie blessed with two big names, it also has an outstanding supporting cast that features Walter Matthau, George Kennedy, James Coburn and Ned Glass. Somehow, Matthau has always excelled at roles that border on comedic and serious, this film, along with Charley Varrick and The Taking of Pelham One, Two, Three quickly come to mind.I do not want to give it away other than to say that this movie has one great ending and I really did not see it coming!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a relative new comer to Audrey Hepburn's movies, so taking a friend's advice, I went out and bought Charade the Criterion Version. Wow! I didn't know what to expect. I'm glad I didn't go into the movie with any expectations. This movie had so many twists and turns. I thought I had it all figured out, then the next scene bam! what you know goes out the window. It's funny, romantic, and thrilling like everyone has before stated. I really liked the mysterious music during the movie and the trailer. It's perfect for a spy movie, yet it's different from the Bond series which I'm so accustomed to.The criterion version came out pretty well. It didn't seem like it was in that bad a condition. Too bad it was in mono though.All of Audrey's movies I've seen so far, she has made a great pair with the leading man. I'm glad to have seen her movies; I only wish I didn't wait so long.10 out of 10 definately!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Charade" is a movie from another time, when a spy mystery didn't require ultra-violent special effects, mayhem, and graphic killings. No, in the early 1960s a spy flick could be spry, witty, and light-hearted. That's how Stanley Donen plots "Charade", stressing dialogue, plot twists, and most importantly the dynamite chemistry between Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. It's a complicated little plot revolving around a missing fortune of Nazi loot, complicated with an assortment of double and triple crosses. Set in Paris, Grant and Hepburn have never seemed so elegant, suave, and sophisticated. It's a treat, and highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little known gem that surprises to the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to decide what genre this movie really belongs to. It's a romantic comedy built around a mystery surrounding a mcguffin. In this case, the mcguffin is a quarter of a million dollars. The money is supposedly in the possession of Reggie Lambert's (Audrey Hepburn) husband (one of several unlucky folks who aren't around for the final reel) but, after he is murdered, the money is not anywhere to be found. To help Reggie cope with her husband's murder, the divorcee Peter Joshua mysteriously appears in her apartment, having first met her briefly on a ski vacation. To her dismay, she discovers that some rather unsavory folks are looking for the money -- and think she has it. A CIA agent named Bartholomew (Walther Matthau) offers to help her, as long as she helps him find the money. From this point, the movie takes a long of unexpected twists and turns that will frighten and delight you the first time you see it, and amuse your memory every time after that. You will NOT know the entire story until the last scene.If Audrey Hepburn, Cary Grant, and a Parisian setting don't sell you, than add Matthau, George Kennedy, James Coburn, Ned Glass, great dialogue, and a soundtrack by Henry Mancini. I was very excited to see that Charade has a place in IMDB's top 250. This is a GREAT rainy night romantic treat!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Charade" is a superb little romantic-mystery-thriller-comedy. Often called "Hitchcockian", it really should be viewed without the mindset one has going into a Hitchcock film. The irreplaceable Cary Grant and the irrepressible Audrey Hepburn are in a life-and-death situation they never seem to take seriously, pitted against bad guys George Kennedy, James Coburn, and Ned Glass. For jaded twenty-first century types, part of the solution should be obvious. Getting there, though, is the fun. Hepburn's husband has been killed, leaving $250,000 (a lot of money in those days) that no one can find. The bad guys think Hepburn has it. Hepburn is intrigued by, and believably falls for, Cary Grant, in one of his most interesting roles. Grant's film persona is funny and sexy, confident and vulnerable by turns; Hitchcock successfully explored a darker side to the persona, making him a menacing playboy. Here, Grant is never menacing, but as the story unfolds his character, never changing outwardly or in tone, nevertheless becomes one of the puzzles of the pieces: is he one of the good guys, one of the bad guys, or a lone ranger after the loot for himself? Made the same year as another classic, "The Pink Panther", the music is another feather in the cap of Henry Mancini, especially with the many variations on the theme song, "Charade"; while this score doesn't have the originality and humor of "The Pink Panther", it's immensely hummable. Highly recommended for an audience willing to take its breezy flippancy as offered, rather than looking for something needlessly profound. It's fun. It's not a main course, it's a fluffy dessert. Enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Has anyone ever been a more swanlike presence in the movies than Audrey Hepburn? She was always long and slender even after she left the movies and became a crusader for the starving children of the world. Gracefulness was her stock-in-trade, and although it came easy to her, it was almost always a star turn--self-conscious, a crutch--until "Charade." It's here--paradoxically--that the actress of whom director Fred Zinnemann ("The Nun's Story") complained was too concerned about her image lets her guard down playing a character who is forced by circumstances to keep her guard up. As Regina Lampert, the widow of a mystery man, a befuddled middle-aged woman who must rely on the aid of another mystery man to protect her from a motley trio of plug-uglies from her husband's past, Hepburn engages in the sort of acting games that women dream of trying only when they're trying them with Cary Grant. And together she and Grant go through their paces; let the lights of Paris (courtesy of veteran cinematographer Charles Lang) play off their faces like delicate, fleeting emotions; and glide almost effortlessly toward the inevitable closing embrace. With James Coburn who is made to greet death with the strangest look of surprise ever frozen on an actor's face; Ned Glass; George Kennedy; and Walter Matthau who must surely possess the funniest deadpan face since Buster Keaton. The denouement--a stirring chase that winds through the Parisian metro to the colonnade of the Palais Royale and beyond--is thrilling, a collaborative triumph of the talents of Stanley Donen who directed it, of Charles Lang who shot it, and of Henry Mancini--fresh from his Oscar win for "Breakfast at Tiffany's"--who furnished the dazzling score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a wonderful "bagatelle", as the French would say. The story itself is quite silly and very unrealistic - there are too many holes in it. Just to mention two of them: even if you are not a philatelist, you would not miss that the stamps on a new letter are a) very old and b) from different countries. At least the police, trained to notice details, ought to have seen it. And how could Regina, when she was all out of money and all her wardrobes empty in the flat, still wear a new very expensive coat every time she goes outside..? But one does not care about these flaws, because when one watches a movie with either Cary Grant or Audrey Hepburn, the main reason is that one wants to see THEM! He still so incredibly handsome and desirable there at age 59, and she so lithe and beautiful, and them both so elegant in their perfect clothes and hair-styles... The dialogue is witty most of the time (but sometimes silly), and one also gets to see a bit of Paris. This is elegance for all times!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless entertainment, and a career high for Hepburn and Grant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charade is in a genre of its own: the romantic caper comedy thriller. The colors and shapes of the title sequence belong unmistakably to the early 1960s, as do the characters' clothes, hairstyles, and speech mannerisms. Yet over 50 years after its release the humor is still fresh, the twists still surprise, and Audrey and Cary are still the epitome of cool. The supporting actors, especially Walter Matthau and James Coburn, give the movie a sharp edge and high stakes. It is no hyperbole to say that Charade is one of the most purely entertaining films of all time. It is also arguably the best film that either Hepburn or Grant made during their long and very successful careers.</fullReview>

Regina is bombarded with constant threats due to her sudden trap surrounded my money, misconception, and murder. She has no choice but to put her life in danger as she searches for the truth and constantly questions who she can trust. Stanley Donen keeps the audience entertained with the combination of dark lighting, loud eerie music, a cast of actors that portray every aspect of their character with absoluter perfection, and of course an intriguing mystery. It starts to even break the Hayes codes by including more sexual content and detailed murder scenes which also keeps the audience intrigued. I cannot really say anything too bad about this film, it was a somewhat slow at some points leaving me to drift off a little, but overall I would have to say this film is actually exceptionally impressive, especially for its time</fullReview>

And Hitchcock would have never directed this comedy.'How can you tell if anyone's lying or not?' CHARADE is a dependable piece of fun. The King of the Hollywood musicals was 39 when he made this thriller; besides his Astaire movies, Donen made other films with Mrs. Hepburn and with Grant.

		<fullReview>I must say, I was shocked by the extremely high ratings many other reviews have given Charade. While not an awful film (I'm rating it 6 out of 10), it's not at all in the same league as the other great films in IMDb's top 250! I appreciate dry humor, which Charade attempts throughout; however, the quality of the writing is such that the humor almost always fails to raise a chuckle. You can see the writer was trying VERY hard to be clever and urbane, but he just wasn't very successful.Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant are their usual wonderful selves, but it's very hard to swallow Hepburn's character's choices, both in survival and in romance. Still, the cast is solid, and the manipulative plot, despite some logical holes mentioned in other reviews, does ultimately engage the viewer enough that boredom never sets in.</fullReview>

About three quarters of the way through the film Hepburn enters the hotel room and finds a body on the floor. We see James Coburn dead with a plastic bag over his head. Following that, we then see Hepburn staring in fright at a name written on the floor. If the character could have a hand free to write the name, why didn't he tear off the plastic bag?

		<shortDescription>Charming, but definitely not a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewing the film after a gap of 35-40 years, I am surprised at how the film is considered to be a top-notch movie.The film's script leaves me cold early into the film: what is the credibility of the leading lady who marries a man, who has no job, no friends and seems to know little else about him except that he has a Swiss passport. The church/undertaker's hall scene, though humorous, is unconvincing with no priests/undertakers and unlike the rest of the film seems unusually close to a stylized black comedy. Anyone who knows philately will know that costly stamps are not stuck on envelopes and peeled off envelopes as shown in the film.Nonetheless, there are aspects of the script that you do not forget easily. The James Coburn and his burning matchsticks scene in the phonebooth are a highlight. So are the chicken and liver wurst sequence with Walter Matthau, hilarious as it unfolds but lacking in credibility when you reach the end of the film. Are smart dialogues the criterion to judge good screenplays?Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn are great to watch but are they providing great performances? Even Henry Mancini has made better music for films than in this one. George Kennedy's character is never developed. The film seems to anticipate the James Bond films right from the title sequence.While I heartily agree the film is an enjoyable family film that keeps you engrossed as any good thriller should, I am surprised it made the grade of the top 250 films on this website. You might consider it to be a classic only if you were not exposed to the cinema made in France, Cuba, and Eastern Europe in the Sixties and Seventies.</fullReview>

Every time I've watched this film, I've though there is just something not quite right here, but I've never been able to put my finger on it.Grant is charming as ever, even as a potential murderer. Audrey Hepburn is a charming victim of being married to the wrong man. Hence the mystery for something that started during WWII. Maybe what I don't like about the film is that you are never quite sure who the bad guy(s) really are, although Walter Matthau (in his pre-comedy days), Ned Glass, James Coburn, and George Kennedy give you a pretty good idea of the type of criminals we're dealing wih there. The question is, is Grant a criminal, too? Thus, the crux of the story.The ending is first truly clever, and then truly charming.But there's still something not quite right. Let's put it this way: I probably have 20 Cary Grant in my DVD collection, but this is not one of them. Not saying pass it up, but just not my favorite, or close to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Charade" is depicted just like a genuine game of charades. Cary Grant changes his name and acts out a different back-story every few scenes and Audrey Hepburn struggles to guess if he is telling the truth. Set in Paris in the 1960s, this charming movie is a hodgepodge of suspense, thriller, and romantic comedy. The dialogue is phenomenal; the witty banter between Hepburn and Grant is hands down the best addition to the plot ? H: Here it comes, the fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow. G: Well, so was Juliet, at fifteen. H: I'm not fifteen. G: Well, that's your trouble. You're too old for me. Grant's acting is quite ingenious. While his character was hard-to-love (because you think he is the antagonist for half of the movie) his down-to-earth, charismatic personality shines through with a glint of his twinkling eye and the slight tilt of his chin after a sarcastic remark. Hepburn on the other hand, is less convincing. Of course it is impossible to take away her womanly charm, her over-exaggerated facial expressions are too much. She is being stalked by four men trying to kill her. I didn't feel like she acted scared at in the least! Instead, she personifies an aloof, innocent, woman that is head-over-heels in love with a man she just met-inappropriate for the circumstances, especially when compared to other movies in the thriller genera such as Silence of the Lambs. The music certainly added to the romantic and suspenseful moments of the plot. While I wasn't particularly ready to pounce out of my seat in the pivotal fight on the rooftop scene, the minor-keyed melody did cause my heart to speed up a few beats. Several ideas reoccurred throughout the movie. For example, male suspects kept dying in their pajamas, fake names and characters were repeatedly created whenever Hepburn figured out Grant's lies, and the "I am divorced" phrase was used in multiple scenes to toy with Hepburn's emotions. Hepburn is portrayed as emotional quite frequently. In many instances, when Hepburn is worried, she eats food. I can relate because many times when I am nervous about studying for a test, I eat food.Grant shared many similar characteristics with Hepburn's diseased husband. They were both used deception to get what they wanted and had multiple cover-up names. While the Hepburn and her diseased husband were never shown together, context clues indicate that the difference between Grant and her husband is that Grant stayed to protect Hepburn while the husband would have selfishly abandoned her. In my experience, when a man lies to you once he will do it again. If I were Hepburn I wouldn't have trusted Grant after I poked holes through his first cover. To get Grant to take a shower in her room, Hepburn screams and acts like there is an imposter in the room. After he finds no one is attacking her, Grant tells her "not to cry wolf." Grant cries wolf (tricks Hepburn) over and over again and in the end, Hepburn still sides with him over Mattheu. Before viewing this movie, I stereotyped all businessmen as greedy scoundrels that would steal money from individuals when given the opportunity. When the stamp seller graciously gave Hepburn back the expensive stamps, I learned that I should not judge a person's character by their occupation. I also would not have given someone a fourth chance if they had lied to me as many times as Grant did. Hepburn taught me that sometimes following your heart can turn out better than making decisions based on prior experiences. All romantic comedies end with a happy ending. Therefore, it makes sense since Charade is a romantic comedy, Grant and Hepburn will get married. A underlying message that I took away from "Charade" is that secrets are like money. Once you lose them it gets harder to create more. Instead of finding another way to become rich, the characters are fixated on getting the money back even though it is nearly impossible. Likewise, once the covers of Grant and Mattheu are blown, it would take one dense individual to believe in anything other than the truth supported with visual evidence.</fullReview>

Walter Matthau is incredible, and it is all directed by Stanley Donen, who is probably better known for his musicals. This should be a huge hit, but I had never heard of it.Apparently the movie is in the public domain because of a copyright goof. I know nothing about that. But it is a tragedy if true. Those responsible for this deserve every ounce of credit. Luckily for audiences, the people at Criterion snatched this one up and saved it. All too often public domain films languish and die. Criterion gave it the star treatment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, along with Walter Matthau, George Kennedy, and James Coburn provide plenty of pleasures in this mashup of genres called Charade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After several years of just reading about this movie, I finally saw Charade on the Internet Archive (which provided a fine print for one that's in the public domain). I read on Wikipedia that this was the "best Hitchcock film Hitchcock never made" and I can't help but agree with that assessment. I mean, with stars like Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, one can't help but see how perfect they are in this mashup of thriller/comedy/romance that Hitch so perfectly did in his heyday especially whenever Grant keeps us on our toes when guessing which side he's on. Director Stanley Donen must have either seen many of Hitch's movies in preparing or he simply had the right instinct of what to do when filming. Also loved Henry Mancini's score and the Maurice Binder credits but I really loved seeing some of the other supporting cast like that of James Coburn and George Kennedy, both of whom provided just the right amount of menace for their parts. One other player I haven't mentioned yet that I loved was also just right for his part: Walter Matthau as someone Ms. Hepburn has to trust to get pertinent info from in order to move the plot along and who also provided a twist that I managed to predict but I didn't mind that I did since it also provided such an exciting climax. Add to that the perfect ending and I'll just say that I wouldn't mind seeing Charade again some day when I'm in the mood for such a pleasurable mix of genres like this one here...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magic and Sparkle !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember how my cinema professor was left agape when I told him that I love (Stanley Donen), (Vincente Minnelli) and movie like (Casablanca). He thought that cinema is all about (Stanly Kubrick) only ! What's wrong about some glamour time? In fact, it's so right. Having a fun time is what movies were grounded on. And still are to a considerable extent; if only well-made. And in the case of (Charade), it is very well made.First of all, the script. I adore it. Look how it creates a real charade by making a story of a crime, a conflict of evil associates which leads to more crimes, with dividing the truths, hiding them, then giving them away one by one, to design a movie of non-stop murders, surprises and twists all along. Not only this, it mixes violence with sex, or let's say sex appeal, when leading this thriller hand in hand with a romantic comedy that has snappy smart lines. So the catchy formula perfects. I bet Hitchcock was jealous !Add to that the star value. Ahhh, it can't get any better than this. (Audrey Hepburn) is a dream, especially in that blue pajama. She had that iconic face and humor, lighting the screen with a smile, a gaze, or maybe a scream. And (Cary Grant) is the very definition of this movie, as a combination of sparkle and magic. He's a load of charisma, fun, vitality. The thing is you wouldn't believe his performance only; you have to fall in love with his persona also. Very few stars in the history of cinema can reach this zenith while being in their third act (Grant was 59 year old at the time, and he retired from movies for good ? after couple of more movies ? in 1966). 3 moments of him had his stamp utterly, forcing you to re-watch them with increasing fun every time; showering with his suit on, picking the orange competition (where Hepburn was laughing for real I suppose), and the funny face he came up with at the last scene; which was very much the best parody out of the audience's reaction towards this heavy long run of twists up to that point (which was very early for a movie back then). The rest of the cast is fine to say the least, with their different looking and speaking characters.Then, the magic continues. A music score by (Henry Mancini). That guy was elegance to movie music. He wrote, as usual, a fascinating theme. And this time it could be played whether as interestingly suspenseful or tearfully romantic. I loved the way it's played in the dining boat scene; with a vocal version of it, or in the amusement center scene; as a part of the place's music, like the whole movie is amusement center. Why writing a theme song to be played in different arrangements throughout a movie seems so old and forgotten these days ?! Undoubtedly it was part of yesterday's special charm. The cinematography is pure cozy, rather analgesic with deeply worm colors. It's the classically dazzling Hollywood movie image back then. (Stanley Donen)'s directing did very good. The fight over the building is memorable. Mixing the on-location shots with the in-studio ones was done adeptly. Yet I think that the best thing (Donen) achieved here was his 2 leading stars' so smooth performance and interplay.Though, (Hepburn)'s character was unconvincing. I didn't buy her as someone under stress or afraid for most of the time. She was having fun, falling in bottomless love with (Grant)'s character, and not having the slightest problem at all, which was a problem for me, the only problem this movie has in my viewpoint.There are some nice references along the way : mentioning American in Paris by (Gene Kelly) who's an old friend of (Stanley Donen) (they co-directed together 3 classic musicals "On the Town ? 1949", "It's Always Fair Weather ? 1955", and "Singin' in the Rain ? 1952"). Or a line like "I taught them everything they know", said by (Grant) about the young lovers' kisses, not as his character in the movie, but as himself; the romantic lead of countless movies. In terms of references to himself, (Grant) didn't feel shy admitting his age, and for more than once (the glasses to read is one), I think at the time he held a position of a "movie star" that allowed him to be (Cary Grant) more than his character here, whatever its true name was, and the movie friendlily toyed with that for honoring purpose. The last scene has it all. The 2 stars shine with magic. The boy, old boy, speaks to his girl about marriage; assuring that every love story has to end with marriage (notice the decorous time; which I personally love and long for). And it's the movie's last surprise, twist, whatever.. when (Grant) turns out to be a government agent; now see how that script played with the cards brilliantly, switching them to make the real thief (Walter Matthau) as the policeman, and the real policeman as the thief (Grant doesn't stop lying from the start about his identity, deciding ? until this moment ? that he's a thief). Sure this was the script's best game, and it saved it for last.This is nothing but great entertainment. It's full of magic's sparkle or sparkle's magic, well, you name it. At any case, worth the love, the DVD, and the fight with that snob professor! P.S : Don't care much for the remake (The Truth About Charlie ? 2002) (Yes, they had the guts to remake THIS !). Enough to tell that they handed over the role of (Cary Grant) to (Mark Wahlberg). Wh@%t t*e F#^k????!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Donen's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's "North by Northwest" and "To Catch a Thief", and in some minor ways better than both, Stanley Donen's "Charade" finds actor Cary Grant teaming up with Audrey Hepburn to find her murdered husband's fortune before it is snatched up by a gang of thieves (George Kennedy, Ned Glass and a young James Coburn).Other than some ordinary camera work (when compared to Hitchcock's more clever eye), "Charade" is Hitchcockian in every other respect, smoothly blending romance, slapstick, crime, clever sight gags, flirtatious banter, wrongful accusations, suave "running man" heroes, another debonair performance by Grant, murder, ghoulish humour, sumptuous European locations and much black comedy. In modern cinema, dozens of films like this are released every year, but back in the early 1960s, "Charade" was novel; it's a 1950s Hitchcock movie with a certain 1960s edge.Donen was known for several musicals ("Singin' in the Rain", "Seven Brids for Seven Brothers" etc), so he has no trouble matching the operatic, luscious tone of Hitchcock (Truffaut was doing a similar thing during this period as well), with sweeping scores, big images, bold colours, big emotional moments, Technicolor titles and overly voluptuous location photography. What separates "Charade" - the film's title itself plays like a self-reflexive joke; a deceptive emulation of Hitch - from what it imitates is Peter Stone's screenplay, which is light on its toes, jaunty, self-aware and self-parodying. It's also a script intimately aware of Grant's early history with studio comedies and Howard Hawks screwballs.Audrey Hepburn is fine in her roll, but she's mostly our avatar; it's through her we gawk and salivate over Grant's perpetual cool. The film's cinematography was by Charles Lang, recognised as one of the greatest American cinematographers. While modern audiences will justifiably find "Charade" dated, and while opinions as to what is "cool" and "entertaining" are constantly shifting (Grant is not as suave as he once was; he's pathetic, old and dorky by today's standards), those with an affection for a certain style of 1950s popcorn will find much to like.8/10 ? See Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's "The Tourist", which also does to Hitchcock what Donen does here. Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here, director Stanley Donen not only weaves together the usual Hitchcock suspense thriller elements - a man (or in this case a couple) on the run from ruthless villains, crackling situation comedy dialogue and a romantic subplot that plays out between all of the runnings about - he actually sneaks in all kinds of trademark Hitchcock visual devices to thrill audiences familiar with the master's work. Hitchcock loved to exploit the audience's fear of heights, for instance, and darned if people in this film aren't standing on ledges and looking over railings etc. The locale is, of course, a foreign one, Paris in this case. And Hitchcock regular Cary Grant is here too, with ultra-chic Audrey Hepburn along and fitting the Continental setting perfectly as she so often did. The 'McGuffin', the device that gets the plot rolling, turns out to be some missing money that a criminal gang assume Audrey has in her possession. Cary comes to her rescue. Or is he working his own angle on her? Her suspicions play beautifully off her developing romantic interest, just as every other element in the film fits together seamlessly. The jokes all work, the thrills thrill, the fast paced segments really move, and Audrey and Cary have fabulous romantic and comedic chemistry together. The production design is gorgeous and posh- looking, yet filled with menacing shadows and glaring lights - more of Hitch's visual devices - and Audrey looks suitably lovely in her trademark Givenchy outfits. And it's not all just a trifling style-piece either. The spy-thriller business at the plot's center, without giving too much away, is logical and compelling. When the movie is over, a viewer is conscious of having had an entirely satisfactory entertainment experience. Unfortunately, this was a one-shot for Cary, Audrey and Stanley. With all of the silly spy nonsense that came out in the mid- 60s, I would love to have seen this group team up for another go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember going to the theater with my mother to see this movie. This was way before the days when videos were available. I think this was the first Cary Grant movie I've seen.I've watched it several times since then, and I can say that this is a total classic in the way movies are made. It's a mystery set in glamorous location with money, murder, and intrigue at it's core.The movie's plot, acting, and cinematography has become dated since it was made, but this was the kind of entertainment people went to movies for back in the early '60s.I wouldn't say that this is the best movie Cary Grant or Audrey Hepburn made, but production is very good, and although following a pat formula, there are no other movie quite like it. It holds its charm and originality still after half a century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charade is a hybrid of genres that exceeds with such delightful results. Featuring compatible direction and an even more compatible couple, this is top notch classy entertainment. Audrey Hepburn is at her most beautiful and elegant in this movie, and Cary Grant as always delivers whatever is required of him, in this case, playing the charming and playful man of deceit.Charade is a story about a married American girl named Reggie Lambert living in Paris, who is just informed that her husband is dead, and that he has 250,00,000 stolen CIA dollars stashed away somewhere. After getting over the shock she is ambushed by several scary men assuming that she has the money and are threatening to kill her unless she confesses to what she doesn't know. She is found in the comfort of Cary Grant who offers to help her fend off these guys until they figure this whole thing out, until she finds out the he's actually a member of their little group.Charade is a fun movie, with lots of plot line twist and tasteful humour, as well as and a wonderful leading and supporting cast. But the best thing about this movie is that it has a rare complexion of mystery, comedy and romance that is weaved together with such skill by Stanley Donen, making it almost impossible to refuse its charm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dangerously funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You can't even be honest about being dishonest!"Charade is a very funny spy/mystery about a dead man, a very large amount of missing money, a threatened widow who is clearly in over her head (Audrey Hepburn), a mysterious man with many names (Cary Grant), and three sinister, shadowy men. This movie has more twists and turns than it should even be possible to fit into 113 minutes, and every time you think you have it figured out, it smacks you in the nose with another curve-ball.The plot is a successful marriage of humor, murder, and danger. People die at every turn, yet there's a small or big laugh around every corner. Hepburn and Grant really get to flex their comedic muscles, thanks to a script that provides excellent banter for the two leads. Hepburn is her typical beautiful, charming, girlish, impossibly adorable self. No surprises there. And Grant handles both the funny and dangerous aspects of his character quite well, to the extent that you never quite know whether to trust him or not. There's great chemistry between the pair, almost to the level between Grant and Grace Kelly in To Catch a Thief. That's a huge compliment, as I absolutely love that movie.Charade does a lot of things very well. And while it stays safely on the side of light entertainment, and doesn't quite have the magic of some of my favorite classic movies, it's a fun movie to watch. Do yourself a favor and see this film; there is very little chance that it could possibly disappoint you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charade is a timeless and classic thriller starring Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. Hepburn plays Regina, a widow whose recently dead husband seems to have left a secret fortune behind. Now she must race against three crooks to find the fortune, assisted by Grant, who is never what he seems. This movie has always been one of my favorites because it combines romance, suspense, and murder in a way that is both thrilling and comedic. Grant steps out of his good guy persona and into a character that may or may not be the bad guy, and Hepburn is fantastic as a woman who really has no choice but to trust him. The film really appeals to all audiences because it does cover so many genres and types. Although this is a great film, no movie can be perfect. Some of the plot twists are a little too twisty, and Grant switches names and aliases so much that only a few of them get fleshed out and understood by the audience. There was a remake of the movie made in 2002, starring Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton. The newer film was never as popular or well now as its predecessor, and Peter Stone, who was a screenwriter for the original, was so against the remake that his name was changed in the credits of the 2002 movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is so effective, probably more effective now than it was when it was released. Oh it was celebrated in its time, but the years highlighted the charm (and the legend) of the actors in it, and we can look at it with a sense of lost world, past things.Stanley Donen, here already away from the Hollywood system, though depending on it, is one of the best directors coming from America.He was deeply original in his more prolific years as a musical director, and he was never less than competent in what he did after that. That includes this enjoyable film. To me, one of his strongest points as a director, was the ability to mix opposite forces and talents, and create an unified vision out of it, by motivating genuine cooperation. Isn't that the best we can expect a director to be? And what a good mixture he makes here. The idea was, i suppose, to create a plot which keeps grabbing the audience by constant twists. We don't know more than Audrey's character, and we try to guess the true character of Grant's. It's tremendously effective, because the twists are subtle and clever, and the dramatic effect that they might have is always brought down by the comedy feel of the whole thing.Grant spent a good part of his career doing comedy, and in fact he probably set most of the standards for comedy acting that were still in use at the time of this film. What public believes is 'funny' becomes easily dated but what he does here still works today, and that is absolutely remarkable. Audrey/Givenchy are in this ride, and being the character she invented for herself on-screen suits this one perfectly.The supporting cast also allows this to work, specially Walter Matthau whom, because of how his lines are placed in the film, and how he distracts us with his great skills as a comedian, fools us as much as he fools Hepburn's character all the way.Henri Mancini is one of my favourite film composers. The music has less presence here than in other films he scored, by i think that's in the mood of the thing.I don't know any recent film that works so easily with this comedy/suspense environment and looks so natural and unforced. I praise the people involved here.My opinion: 4/5 watch it and keep it with youhttp://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

I could not believe that after watching the movie all those times before and I either did not remember the line or did not recognize it before.Who could not laugh at the fruit game!, or still be frightened when Tex threatens her at the phone booth and Regina must brush off the lit matches! The ending comes very quickly though with Dyle being unmasked with Regina's phone call to the embassy asking for Bartholomew and the audience finds out first that "Bartholomew" is really Dyle. Regina does not find out until after she goes to meet him.And the funny face that Grant makes when Regina finds out that he is really Brian Crookshank's the US Treasury Dept official!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most underrated film of all time and should be in the top 20 or 30 films ever produced. Why hasn't it achieved greater status among the great films of the 20th century? In my opinion, its even better than Hitchcock's great films of the 50's. There are three reasons this film is great, among others of course. 1) The plot is paced perfectly and you never know who is telling the truth. This movie is about trust. You cannot be sure that anyone is who they say they are and who's really after the money: hence the name of the film. I've rarely ever seen something pulled off so flawlessly. 2) Grant and Hepburn. Two of the most charismatic film stars ever with (at the time) their choice of scripts. Of course they would choose this absolute gem.3) The dialogue. It brought be back to the great films of the 40's like Notorious, Big Sleep and Maltese Falcon. Grant's witty replies to Hepburn's questions are some of the best I've ever heard. I sat amazed at the brilliant writing.10/10. Unquestionably one of the finest mysteries ever made and up there with the greats of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CHARADE is a funny, thrilling and brilliant film. In a very Hitchcockiaen mood, Peter Stone make a perfect script, Mancinis score is a masterwork and Donen make his best picture without Gene Kelly. The film is almost a parody on Hitchcock, but clearly made by a admirer (Donen also made the terribly "Arasbusgue") Its the best homage to the master (shared with Francois Truffauts "The bride wore black"). Hepburn has one of her best role and is wonderful. Grant is a little bit too old for the part. 10 years before, he would have been exellent - now he is "just" great. And why is Hepburn so "lovesick" after Grant, when he seems to have no interest ?, how can everybody leave a important office left alone ?, how can she no nothing about her husband ?, and why is a civil servant running around with guns, searching for money ? But anywhy if you search for a serious object to analyse - you have chosen a bad choice. If you "just" searching for outstanding entertaining, CHARADE is a right choice.P.S. Note the obviously salute to Grace Kelly in the stampshop</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best non-Hitchcock Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is certainly understandable how this movie has come to be known as "the best Hitchcock movie he never made." Nor should we fault those who have called CHARADE a Hithcock movie. The similarities are uncanny: Shocking opening scene involving a corpse, psychedelic opening credits (a la Vertigo and Psycho), Cary Grant stars as a thief, international intrigue plays a part, the female lead is strong yet beautiful, it has an unexpected plot twist, and it ends with a surprise. AND it's even put out by Universal (just like nearly every other American Hitchcock movie)! Most of all this movie is filled with incredibly black humor that trademarked many of Hitchcock's films. But Charade is not a Hitchcock film, it is a Stanley Donan film. And while it does star Cary Grant as a thief, it does not star a blond-haired leading lady (and by 1963, Hitchcock was deep into his blond-haired obsession - Tippi Hedrin anyone?). Instead, the stunningly beautiful Audrey Hepburn stars opposite Grant, and she has jet-black hair. The story is basically one in which Hepburn's character (Reggie Lampert) finds herself the widow of a murdered husband. She goes on to find, thanks to CIA agent Bartholomew (Walter Matthau in a rare dramatic performance), that her husband had left behind $250,000 in stolen money in some form or another. But that money is not only wanted by the CIA, but by her husband's three - or is it four? - companions who had helped him steal it. These companions, played by Grant, James Coburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass, start dying off one by one, and Hepburn finds herself fighting to trust Grant (who keeps revealing a different identity), while all the while falling in love with him.This is truly one of the most underrated movies of all time. First of all, the directing is worthy of Hitchcock. Although it does not include any of Hitchcock's memorable tricks (probably because this is NOT a Hutchcock movie!) it does a very good job of keeping the pace of the movie interesting, while not sacrificing character development or subtlety.The acting is simply stunning. Cary Grant, slightly gray in this, one of his last movies, is stunning as always, capturing that blend of humor and mischief that made his To Catch a Thief performance so classic. He shines as always, proving that we may never get an actor like him ever. In CHARADE, it is quite obvious that Ian Flemming knew what he was talking about when he modeled James Bond after Grant's characterisms and acting style. Hepburn is gorgeous. The chemistry between her and Cary is fantastic (on a par with Grant and Grace Kelly in TCaT). Not only that, but on the eve of the sexual revolution, Grant and Hepburn were able to create a movie filled with sexual and steamy romance without a single iota of nudity or crass language. The supporting cast is equally good. Grant's three cohorts are equally funny and diabolical, partly parody and partly malevolent. Matthau also provides some good acting. although he falls somewhat short towards the end.But what really stands out throughout CHARADE is the humor. In the funeral hall, as Hepburn's dead husband lies in repose, his still-living compatriots march in, each in an increasingly funny entrance (think sneezing and door-slamming). The amounts of macabre humor rival any Hitchcock movie out there. Likewise, the screwball hilarity is reminiscent of other Grant classics like "Arsenic and Old Lace". For example, after several minutes of debating Grant's taking a shower in Hepburn's room, he walks into the shower and begins scrubbing with his clothes on. The humor and romance intertwined around the intrigue and death is simply beautiful.Once again, CHARADE is severely underrated. It deserves the recognition that "Rear Window" and "Psycho" receive as being top-notch thrillers. Undoubtedly one of Grant's best movies, and it would have been one of Hitchcock's best, too... If only he had made it.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charade is, without a doubt, one of the most delightful movies ever! Not only are the two lead actors, Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, marvelous in well-written roles, but the supporting cast (which includes Walter Matthau, James Colburn, and George Kennedy) is also magnificent. The scenery is beautiful and a great background for a great story. The upbeat music, composed by Henry Mancini, is perfect for this thriller. And of course, the script is wonderful with it's different themes like romance, suspense, and thriller. And you just have to love those comedic quips.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie Charade is unique, in that it seems to flawlessly blend thegenres of the Mystery of who killed Charles Lampert and his associates,the Romance between Regina Lampert and the elusive 'Peter Joshua', theSuspense Regina experiences trying to figure out what's going on andavoid getting killed, and the ever present comedy, like the way each ofthe victims is killed, and that all of them, except Tex, are found intheir pajamas by the police.Cary Grant, like usual, does an excellent job of portraying hischaracter without dominating the screen, allowing Audrey Hepburn properexposure when they're together; she, of course, returns the favorspectacularly. The other primary actors also give their best, and helpmake the film a pleasant (or frightening, depending on your point ofview) experience for the audience. Walter Matthau is also great, goofyenough to lead you on until you discover who he really is. JacquesMarin is also wonderful as the film's police detective, able to rant andrave about the various complications of the plot without spoiling themovie, or compromising its intent.Overall, I think this is certainly one of Cary Grant's best films, andafter viewing it on DVD for the first time, and reviewing it again withthe audio commentary, I learned more about the film's creation, andenjoyed it more. Overall, I've seen Charade at least six times, andhave thoroughly enjoyed it.</fullReview>

She returns to Paris and find out that she is being pursued by people who are after her husband's loot. She is aided by Cary Grant who may or may not be a good guy, keeps changing identity and there are enough twists and turns that will keep a citizen of small Parisian back alley in a frenzy.Its the cast that makes this film special.

		<shortDescription>A Hitchcock-style thriller without Hitchcock himself, who would have thought of it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Stanley Donen's 1963 mystery "Charade", starring Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, has often been considered the best film that Alfred Hitchcock never made. And to give credit where credit's due, "Charade" does resemble a typical Hitchcock picture in terms of its style and premise. They even got Cary Grant to star in this picture, who starred in many of Hitchcock's earlier pictures such as "To Catch a Thief" (1955), "North by Northwest" (1959), and "Notorious" (1946). Whether or not "Charade" is truly worthy of comparison to Hitchcock's best films remains to be seen. In the meantime, let's venture forth into the premise behind this picture that Hitchcock didn't make. A young lady named Reggie Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) has recently learned that her husband has been murdered. The only item in his possession in which the informants were able to recover was his travel bag which is filled with other various items. During his funeral, she notices three suspicious men (James Coburn, George Kennedy, and Ned Glass) attending to see the body simply to confirm that this person's dead. A CIA administrator (Walter Matthau) informs her that these three men are after the money that was in her husband's possession. He also informs her that her husband was with these men on an important mission to deliver $250,000 in gold to the French Resistance. But they all stole the gold, her husband double crossed these men, and he took all the gold for himself. Now this administrator tells her that not only do these three men want the money back, but so does the U.S. government. The administrator insists that Reggie has possession of the money, but she doesn't know where it is. So these three men are now coming after her to retrieve her husband's wealth. A stranger named Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) helps her out with her dilemma. But not only does he need to know where the money is, he may or may not have been involved with the other three men and her husband in their mission. It's important to note that Stanley Donen, the director of this film, was best known for directing such beloved musicals as "Singin' in the Rain" (1952), "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" (1954), and "On the Town" (1949). With a resume like that, you wouldn't expect a director like Donen to be able to do justice in replicating a Hitchcock picture. But somehow even with his inexperience with Hitchcockian type thrillers, he gets Hitchcock's style down very well here. It helps that the plot to "Charade" bares many similarities to such Hitchcock classics as "To Catch a Thief" and "North by Northwest". Chief among these similarities being that the main character is trying to evade someone or some people after them for something they didn't do, and finding love with someone along the way whom they can and can't trust. The dilemma that Reggie gets into is relentless between the three guys interrogating her for information regarding her husband's fortune and Peter's many secrets that he's keeping from her. I admire how well she handles all of this madness that suddenly occurs in her life as a result of her husband's actions. Because of the way she handles this whole situation to the best of her ability, we're able to have an easier time sympathizing with her. And although he lies to her more than once, Peter is also worthy of sympathy as well. Without revealing any more about his character, we sympathize with him and the lies he has to tell because he has no other option in terms of helping Reggie out. Are the antagonists in this film memorable in any way? I'm afraid not, since they're pretty basic character wise and are simply there to progress the story and nothing more. Are there a few scenes that put the film to a halt or slow it down at least? Yes, one scene that comes to mind is when Reggie is conversing with Peter and they literally talk about the movie "An American in Paris" (1951) for whatever reason. In the end, I'm not ready to consider "Charade" a great film yet mainly because it didn't quite blow my mind like some of Hitchcock's best work. I think it could have ended earlier and gotten to the point a tad faster, but that's just me. Any hardcore Hitchcock fans who see "Charade" will find plenty of things to admire about it, mainly how closely it resembles the work of the Master of Suspense himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie wasn't directed by Hitchcock but still gives you a feeling of watching one. It starts as a romantic-comedy movie but later leads into something mysterious. Keeps the viewer guessing the villain throughout the entire movie and director Stanley Donen does it too well. Not only the villain but also the Character name of Cary Grant is a mystery (Peter Joshua alias Alexander Dyle, alias Adam Canfield alias Brian Cruikshank). Henri Mancini's Oscar-nominated score supported the on-screen romance scenes for Grant and Hepburn (ignoring the actor's 20 years age gap). Ned Glass was awesome, the way he sneeze adds comic element. Kennedy and Coburn were cool in their roles too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charade is supposedly the result of Singin' In The Rain's director gambling his better hand on a Hitchcockian thriller. There are echoes of and references to Spellbound, Stage Fright and North by Northwest, but rather than being remotely Hitchcockian, Charade is silky, glittery, childish, overacted and far too self-aware to be in any way thrilling. Cary Grant referring to Audrey Hepburn's apartment "on the street where you live" is the kind of fun little reference to the musical work of his stars that Stanley Donen would probably be interested in. Frankly, if Donen had adjoined musical numbers or a repertoire of prominent theme songs, that kind of consistency would've made it glorious, but in its present condition it's a trivial case of star-cuddling.Everything is too bouncy, there is no danger, even for the foundling-like Audrey Hepburn moving up and down on waves of trickery after her worthless husband disappears and is reported dead. With this pitch established, the film's march of assassinations and laborious twists are carried with a jolly indifference, punchlines to frivolous gags. It would have a sense of anticipation of tension if Donen didn't capture Paris as a silky castle in the sky. This movie is so flippant and vain, it skirts on scatterbrained. However, the writing is clever, and if Cary Grant is your leading man, you might as well take full advantage of that fact.Grant was more overstatedly Grant in this movie than he'd been in anything since his slapstick days, that manic persona translated with age into his trademark broken bluster, puckered look of offended sensibilities, his ribbing impression of being able to get precisely what he wants if he could only afford the sweat. When one particular hooligan, out of a zanily over-the-top group of such brutes, pushes him to a rooftop with the intent of teaching him to fly, Grant is so earnestly matter-of-fact: "All right, but the view better be worth it." He's superb, but Donen's lack of economy in indulging his charisma plugs up the momentum like brakes on what's supposed to be a racecar.Hepburn is a good equal, all jolts and moans, carrying the kind of frustrated babe-in-the-woods openness of her Susy Hendrix in Wait Until Dark, although far more virginal. The most un-Hitchcockian thing about the movie is watching them become smitten, which ironically would be significantly expedited if she could solve where his allegiances truly lie. There is a tangle of secrets and deceit to decipher, and the location of a hoard of money her dead husband had supposedly pilfered from his friends, played with casual heartlessness by James Coburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass. But the plot is mere lip service. It's the sagging of Hepburn's suspicion that matters, and the anchoring of Grant's contrariness. Just slurp the silky romance of the movie's most famed line, as Hepburn's intoxicated Regina rends her heart asunder: "Do you know what's wrong with you?" she asks of Peter. "Nothing."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie That Presents Action, Romance, Comedy and Mystery in Right Doses, With a Very Charming Central Pair of Stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn, charming and elegant as usual) is spending vacation in some skiing station, when she meets Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) for the first time. They have some ironic conversation in a table of a bar. She has the intention of getting the divorce from her husband Charles when she comes back to Paris. When she arrives home, she finds her apartment totally empty and that Charles was murdered, dropped from a train. She goes to the morgue, to recognize the body, and she receives his assets in a small wallet. Later, she receives a call from Carson Dial (Walter Matthau), from the American Embassy. They meet each other and he informs her that Charles was a CIA agent, and he had stolen in 1944, during the WWII, the amount of US$ 250,000.00 with four other agents. He also advises that these men will chase her, trying to recover the money. Then, Tex Panthollow (James Coburn), the freak Herman Scobie (George Kennedy) and Leopold Gideon (Ned Glass), Charles' former partners, threatens her. Regina meets Peter again and he protects her, until she gets suspicious of him. Regina in the end does not know who is trustful or not. Yesterday I had lunch with a couple of colleagues and one of them told me that `Charade' is one of his favorite movies. I decided to check it out and I do not regret: it is indeed a movie that presents action, romance, comedy and mystery in right doses. All of that, supported by the wonderful Audrey Hepburn (in my opinion, one of the most beautiful smiles in the history of the cinema) and an older, but still handsome, Cary Grant. The ironical and sometimes acid dialogs are great. Some parts of the screenplay seem to pay homage to Alfred Hitchcock, with a delightful mystery. There are many shifts in the plot until the last scene. The quality of image of the VHS available in Brazil is not good. A magnificent entertainment, indicated for the whole family. My vote is eight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit of a farce, but enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)This is a distinctly Stanley Donen film (some others: Singin' in the Rain 1952, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers 1954, Funny Face 1957, Damn Yankees 1958, Indiscreet 1958) characterized by light comedy prepared expressly for the middle American palate a little past mid-century, professionally done with offense to no one. There is just the barest hint of satire with a few laugh-at-the-genre jokes but nothing so blatant as to detract from the woman's fantasy, wish-fulfillment that is the essential point.One of the jokes in the film is that Audrey Hepburn always kisses Cary Grant first. This is entirely appropriate, I suppose, considering that he was at the time 59-years-old and she was 34. Both were (and are) two of Hollywood's enduring stars, Miss Hepburn perhaps at or near the pinnacle of her career when this movie was made, and Cary Grant in his last significant role. The chemistry is nice, creative and there are some funny lines. She chases him and he catches her, is the way it is played, when of course it is usually the other way around: HE chases her and SHE catches him!The stars are given fine support from Walter Matthau, James Colburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass in quasi-comedic roles as a quartet of sinister bad guys. The music (and the memorable "Charade" theme) are by Henry Mancini whose musical scores adorned nearly a hundred Hollywood movies beginning in the fifties. I particularly remember his music from the Pink Panther flicks in the sixties and seventies.Director Stanley Donen, despite being a paragon of commercial success, has a quality of making sardonic fun of the audience or of his stars in a way that is barely discernible. I think it's the cynicism of the Hollywood product that he became so adept at making, and his subconscious realization of what he was doing, that sometimes seeps through. Here he begins with "Boy Meets Girl, Cute" in the Alps with Hepburn in a costume reminiscent of something out of the middle ages, covering almost as much of her as a burka, her beautiful eyes masked by big dark glasses. It's a joke and perhaps a setup for contrast. When Audrey Hepburn smiles and her eyes light up in delight, she is most arresting. Imagine the whole film without seeing her eyes. (In Blame It on Rio 1984, Donen deliberately had Michael Caine in those hideous square plastic frames big enough for Mrs.Doubtfire.) And what I mean by Donen's attitude toward his audience, that he believes they only want familiar escapism, is the touristy feel of the Parisian scenes in which most of the action takes place. They are mostly spots frequented by American tourists seeing Europe for the first time, the Seine, the Metro, the Arc d'Triumph, Notre Dame cathedral, the Louis XVI apartment sans furnishing, the Paris opera house, etc. The fact that we can't be sure who-done-it until the very end when it becomes obvious by the process of elimination, didn't sit well with me. I also did not like the chase scenes in the Metro because it seemed abundantly silly to imagine that Hepburn in her long skirt and dress shoes could outrun Cary Grant, who had, in a previous scene, engaged in fisticuffs a bigger man (Kennedy with a steel claw for one of his hands). Nonetheless, Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn together for the first (and only) time is a treat not to be missed. Cary Grant is particularly good as he maintains a wry stoicism against the power of Miss Hepburn's charms. Noteworthy is the excellent camera work exemplified in the two shots of Hepburn's face caught in light and shadow in the Paris opera house.For those of you thinking of seeing Jonathan Demme's remake of this film, The Truth About Charlie (2002), I would caution against it since the unreality of the story borders on the ridiculous and must be played as comedy. Without the star power and some of the clever dialogue of Donen's film I am afraid the plot contrivances would be embarrassingly exposed, although the idea of getting a quarter of a million dollars past customs in the form of very expensive (hint: small) art objects that appear to be ordinary objects, is a nice device that would probably work.See this for Cary Grant whose rugged good looks and smooth and effortless delivery made him a Hollywood legend and the epitome of a suave leading man.</fullReview>

It is the acting, the plot, the dialogue, and the richness of the actors themselves that makes up for the lack of direction. Still, it is so easy to become so engrossed in the film that overlooking the minor flaws is hardly a feat.The shower scene is classic.

		<fullReview>My feelings towards "Charade" are fairly mixed. When I first saw it, I wasn't impressed. After repeated viewings, I didn't feel so negative about it anymore, but I still experience it as an uneven combination of light comedy and suspenseful mystery that suffers from some badly misplaced elements.Firstly, the three villains played by Coburn, Kennedy and Glass really seem to belong in another movie, as they are way too quirky characters for this kind of glossy flick. (There's also a terribly annoying kid with his water pistol.) Secondly, the romantic angle between Grant and Hepburn seems ludicrous, mainly due to the huge age gap.Although there are indeed some very nice location shots around Paris, nearly the entire middle section of the film takes place indoors and tends to drag on a bit. Also, Hepburn's acting doesn't quite convince at every turn, but that's almost inessential since she looks so elegant in her Givenchy costumes. Matthau, however, is surprisingly excellent in a rather unusual role for him.</fullReview>

The acting is superb and the plot-though complicated-will keep you intrigued. I see some people complain that the story is hard to follow but actually it really isn't. I watched another film called The Big Sleep-another mystery movie-that had much more going on it and I couldn't keep track of it all.

The age difference between the two is awkward with regard to romance, but the script cleverly makes light of it by including jokes about it. The plot has holes in it and it's fairly easy to guess the identity of the killer. However, it is so entertaining that any shortcomings can be overlooked.

Many scenes in the movie are indelible- one wants to jet to Paris to see them all. Unfortunately, much of the film takes places near Les Halles which has been extensively renovated since the movie was filmed. The director captures a slightly-seedy-but-still-elegant hotel perfectly. The characters (villains a-plenty) are beautifully acted and unforgettable. What was Reggie's husband really up to? Who was he?

		<fullReview>I thought Singin in the Rain was "dull, unfunny, and over-rated," and I stand by that assessment, so I was a little worried about this movie, but I actually enjoyed it nonetheless.It would be impossible to adequately review this movie without even mentioning Hitchcock, as this is the kind of movie he specializes in. Maybe it's unfair to Donen to contrast and compare to Hitchcock, but I can't help but feel there are areas in this movie that Hitchcock would have done better, and that would be a sense of danger. Maybe others will disagree, but I did not feel one from this movie.Okay, so that's not really a flaw, just something I personally felt was missing. But I do like the movie. I think the acting was great, even Hepburn was good at comic delivery, and normally she leaves me underwhelmed. The directing was good, but not great. The script was probably the strongest element.There are flaws though. The script has weak points, some of the most important events in the movie hinge on some very unfeasible things, like Dyle managing to sneak into the US embassy during lunch hour to set up a phony appointment with Hepburn. And perhaps I missed the explanation for this, but why is it that Hepburn seems to know next to nothing about her husband? She doesn't know if he's rich or poor, has friends, or anything. Grant's changing identity seems to be an overly-elaborate attempt to keep an otherwise straightforward plot twisting around. Why would the OSS trust five greedy psychopaths to deliver gold in an important, secret mission?I gave this movie a 7/10. It was a good, entertaining movie, but not a must-see, and something I doubt I'd watch again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Might be some spoilers.* First; there's that Henry Mancini music. The climactic chase scene, alone, is quite literally a toe-tapper, once that off-camera percussionist starts beating on that cocoanut! Then, there are the Bad Guys. George Kennedy is suitably nasty as Herman the Hook. James Coburn rises above the limitation of an obviously phony Texas drawl. And, Ned Glass is uproarious as the nasally allergenic Gideon! Walter Matthau is very convincing as an American government bureaucrat. But, of course, the chemistry between Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn steals the show. I mean, Grant's character goes from one alias to another, literally without blinking! And, yet, Hepburn (as Regina Voss/Lampert) willingly goes back under his debonair spell, each and every time. What else can I say, except: four stars!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well if your starting line-up is Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant being directed by Stanley Donen, you know going in you have a fairly good shot at creating something great. And the three of them did. This is a perfect combination of romance, comedy, suspense and action.You are kept guessing the entire time who is who and since the movie moves so well and is so completely entertaining, you are going to have a great time watching this. Add three actors who would go on to win Supporting Oscars - Walter Matthau, George Kennedy and James Coburn - all of whom are very funny and menacing. Kennedy, Coburn and Ned Glass make memorable entrances into the movie, one by one, each funnier than the last. I am sure in 1963 this was thought of as a decent movie, no great big deal. Seen today, next to today's computer-generated movies and movie stars, it looks even better. I am also reminded of the fact that Hollywood cannot even come up with anyone who can hold a candle to Grant and Hepburn in the class department. Maybe certain types of movies are out of style, but the magic of a star is timeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film Hitchcock never made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The similarities with Hitchcock's movies are too numerous to mention, other than to comment that CHARADE may well be the best Hitchcock film that he never actually made (that honour goes to Hepburn mainstay Stanley Donen). This is a witty and affectionate comedy/romance/mystery featuring impeccable performances from Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn as two people thrown into a mystery involving a hidden fortune and some deadly foes.CHARADE has a lot going for it, not least the crisp, neat, early '60s style. Grant is at his charismatic best, even though it's clear he's past his prime here, while Hepburn plays the usual intelligent, glamorous and slightly fragile character that she's so adept at. Film fans will be in their element with the presence of numerous soon-to-be-famous actors, including George Kennedy, James Coburn, and Walter Matthau.The story twists and turns at a merry place, ably mixing romance with murder and coming off well as a result. I particularly liked Grant's murky character motivations and how you're left constantly wrong-footed as to his character's true intentions. There's little to dislike here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn were well matched, an ex acrobat and an ex ballerina. Ten years earlier they were both among the most beautiful people in the world. Grant's dimple and Hepburn's eyes could have sold a movie all by themselves. Gawd, she was stunning, a la gamin. Alas, features harden or sometimes soften with age and the end result, even if only barely noticeable, is a little depressing. A couple of jokes point up the difference in age between the two but it doesn't help much. Time's winged chariot. Shudder.Their performances, though, are as fine as ever. Grant had nearly perfect comic timing and Hepburn looked born to be shocked. Stanley Donen's direction is efficient and Henry Mancini's musical score is appropriately mysterious and romantic at the same time. The supporting players do exactly as much as needs to be done -- Walter Matthau (in the dubious role of mustachioed villain), the angular James Coburn, the bulky George Kennedy, and the treacherous mouse, Ned Glass.It's a bit weak, compared to other romantic comedies of the same period -- Blake Edwards' "The Pink Panther," for instance. The chief problem is with the screenplay, which thinks its funnier than it is. The amusement seems forced at times, too much given over to lengthy scenes in which Grant takes a shower in his drip-dry suit while Hepburn laughs herself silly, or to scenes in which the couple try to transport an orange from under one neck to under another without using their hands."Do you want to see where I was tattooed?" "Yes." "Good, we'll drive around there sometime." You can hear joints creaking as the guffaws are reached for.I saw this when it was released and found it charming. The charm has faded with the years but it's still a diverting example of its genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Donen and Audrey Hepburn certainly had a lot of chemistry as a director/actress duo, one only slightly matched by Hepburn and Cary Grant's on-screen chemistry. Charade is just simply damned good mystery entertainment, at times thrilling, funny, and occasionally bewildering. It's one of them twist upon a twist upon a twist movies (see: Paris When It Sizzles, also starring Audrey Hepburn) set in the gorgeous backdrop of Paris (see: Paris When It Sizzles, also starring Audrey Hepburn) and featuring an almost automatic romance between a couple who are basically ready to jump each other's bones from frame one but have to worry through all that plot first (see: Paris When It Sizzles, also starring Audrey Hepburn). Unlike Paris When It Sizzles, however, it's not all just meta ultimately pointing to one sole purpose, but has some really gripping storytelling.This is the type of movie where I had the killer figured out within a moment, but it didn't exactly mean the story was all that predictable. My favorite part of it is the constantly changing relationships of the characters as they all vie around each other attempting to gain the upper hand. Hepburn's own doe-faced surprise at every turn is less a character under duress and more an audiences' chorus as she watches with bright eyes the layers peeling back in front of her. If there's any real unbelievability to the movie, it's that she has so much patience for it, or if she has that she's ever telling the truth during the many times she says, "I'm scared".--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me Charade symbolizes everything good about old Hollywood movies: the stars, the luxurious sets, the intelligent dialogue, the twistful plot, the humor and suspense and fast-paced action that made them so entertaining.Audrey Hepburn plays Regina "Reggie" Lambert, an American living in Paris. She has an unhappy marriage with Charlie, a man she doesn't know very well. So she decides to divorce her. But before she does, he's conveniently assassinated. And so begins one of the greatest cat-and-mouse games in the history of cinema, as war criminals, CIA agents and Reggie not only try to find the killer but also the $250,000 the dead man was supposed to have on him.With beautiful Paris as the backdrop, it's inevitable that this thriller become a romantic movie, and there's no one better for Hepburn to fall in love with than the great Cary Grant. Their relationship is witty, heartfelt and enjoyable to watch on the screen. He plays an American who conveniently meets Reggie in her moment of crisis, but as the movie progresses his role changes many times until we're not sure who he really is.Twistful as the plot may be, it's also a lovely comedy, poking fun at the crime and thriller genres, with amazing inventions and situations for the characters to get out of. Peter Stone deserves all praise for his inspired screenplay. I live for movies like this, that mix a good dose of light-hearted fun with the best aspects of thrillers. This is the equivalent of a good Agatha Christie mystery. They just don't make movies like this anymore.With a cool cast that includes George Kennedy, Walter Mathau and James Coburn, Charade is a suspenseful movie that lives up to its title: you'll be guessing throughout the movie the truth about everything you're watching until the satisfying and logical conclusion. Watch it and delight in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock-like Thriller Still Has Its Moments -- Despite Bad Acting and Being Dated , A. Hepburn &amp; Grant Worth the Admission Price</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always wondered when 1960's movies started using those rather psychedelic and/or cartoon title intro sequences. And always with the accompaniment of some exotic-inspired music soundtrack with conga drums accompanying lush strings. It came into vogue somewhere in the early 1960's with The Pink Panther, Doris Day films, and other light-hearted action-comedies. Even the original James Bond films jumped on the band-wagon. Charade, a movie NOT directed by Hitchcock, uses the psychedelic opening with the letters of the words dancing around the screen to Latin jazz rhythms which immediately gives away its 1960's roots.The plot is simple enough. Audrey Hepburn's spouse is dispatched and dumped from a train in France before the titles of the movie start dancing around the screen. Turns out he had $250,000 in his possession but the loot has vanished. For a guy worth $100,000's, no one comes to his funeral in Paris except three American baddies, a one-hand trench-coat, a southern red-neck, and an allergic nerd. They didn't come to sob at the funeral. Instead, they each visit Hepburn demanding the dearly departed's money. They threaten to dispatch her they way they did her husband. Of course, she turns out to be a lot more difficult than her husband who appears to have been knocked off without much of a struggle. She then turns to Cary Grant for help, until she discovers he has been lying about who he is. Whom can she trust? And of course, there is Walter Matthau, an American agent (or spy?), who represents the US government's interest in retrieving the money.What saves the movie is the clever banter between Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant. Of course, Grant has the wittiest lines, although Hepburn keeps up with him stride-for-stride, or rather line-for-line. At one point Hepburn points out she is a widow, and Grant replies that so was Juliet at 15. To which Hepburn says "I am not 15!" Grant then replies "Well that's your trouble. You're too old for me." Grant was almost 60 and Hepburn was 34 when they made this movie.If some of the actors playing the baddies used their footage in this movie as the final exam for an acting class, they would have failed miserably. It's amazing the likes of George Kennedy and James Coburn weren't in the actors' unemployment line after the release of Charade. And some of the writing is also a bit weak, especially Kennedy, replete with prosthetic metal hand, walking around groaning "Give me the money!" And James Coburn as a Midwest red-neck called Tex whose lines are little better, if you can distinguish the words through his rough-and-ready rather mediocre attempt at a Texas accent. I doubt whether real Texans could understand what he is saying! You will neither confuse this movie with Film Noir of a couple of decades earlier nor with action movies a couple of decades later. The entire look and feel was born out of a slightly new Hollywood style where filmmakers were trying to give their work a little more pizazz than some of the overly fluffy stuff produced in the 1950's. Action movies were no longer set in dark urban America where lesser-known actors limped into alleyways to avoid their pursuers. Now, they were shot on location all over the world, often in Europe, with the biggest movie stars imaginable. And the experience wouldn't be complete without the innocent sexual innuendo that permeates these films. In Charade, Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, the Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig of Hollywood, take the audience on a roller-coaster ride of entertainment masquerading as over-the-top intrigue. It is just pure escapist entertainment, and you'll also breathe a little when you disembark from the roller-coaster. And it is a perfect representative of a bygone era of Hollywood film-making.</fullReview>

It was very enjoyable throughout. Charade has many strengths, but if I had to say its biggest, it would be the acting. Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn give great performances and they have great chemistry together. Walter Matthau has a small but very memorable role. The rest of the supporting cast does great. My only quarrel is the little boy, he was just ok. The movie also has a great script, that it is as intelligent as it is witty. The script blends together Romance, Comedy, and Suspense. All three of them are distributed evenly among the movie. So if you have two hours of spare time, watching Charade is a perfect way to spend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hepburn falls in love for no discernible reason whatsoever and then continues to adore and believe in a man who proves to perpetually lie to her over and over again. With each new explanation Grant gives regarding his identity, she swoons, seemingly incapable of self-respect, and stares with the vacant doe-eyes of a teenage. Regina is one of Hepburn's least interesting creations, the character's sole trait is that she's funny (and she is, her and Grant both are very funny). However, the comedy is forced and ill-balanced with the suspense. This isn't nearly as well-crafted as the globe-trotting Hitchcock films in the same vein. Donen's musicals are some of the best ever, this... not so much. And don't even get me started on that annoying kid. Having said all of that... the funeral scene is worth it's weight in rare stamps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a fluffy, adorable movie about men dying and vying for money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's often called in that cliché term the "Best Hitchcock Movie He Didn't Make". It's understandable of course - the mistaken identities, the spies (sorry, "agents"), and Cary Grant, plus a foreign locale in particular with France and Paris (and To Catch a Thief, which this has a somewhat similar flavor to most of all, had two of those things for sure). But it's really in the shallowest terms that it can be described like that, even as I'm sure it would make a fine second film on a double bill with North by Northwest or Notorious. Something about the film is a little too... light, yes, even in comparison with Hitchcock. Not that it's a bad thing, far from it, but Charade is its own Hollywood escapist animal.The director here is Stanley Donen, who's Singin' in the Rain is maybe the greatest movie musical Hollywood produced. He brings together these stars, Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant, along with supporting players like Walter Matthau (for me a bit underused, though when you see the movie you'll know why), James Coburn and George Kennedy, and takes Peter Stone's comic script and gives it polish and flair. It's also filled with an air of romance - of course, if it's from Hollywood in the 50's or 60's and it has Grant and/or Hepburn, you're bound to usually find romance, and why not, they're beautiful people to look at and even more attractive when they're having to play irony or cute-sarcasm in their dialogs.The plot is fairly frivolous, and in the third act (though only then really) there's a kind of MacGuffin, but it all links back to money. I have a feeling Stone set up this plot, and knew it was good, but even compared to Hitchcock the stakes seem kind of low. When the fellow past-WW2-thieves get together to try and hash out where the quarter of a million are, though there are snarls and comically timed sneezes and Kennedy's got that hook for a hand, nothing is too menacing, and the threat level is actually quite low, and Donen's direction, though solid, doesn't have that calibrated, sometimes experimental side that Hitch had in spades. At least, I should say, it was for me. Perhaps I've just seen too many of these films (including, I should also note, Jonathan Demme's 2002 remake, The Trouble with Charlie, which I hadn't seen since then but suddenly seemed as fresh as it was when I first saw it, but I digress).For those going into it as a casual movie-goer, maybe seeing just a thriller or a comic escapade here and there, Charade will seem fresh as all heck. One thing that I can give it, aside from the obvious and light (but wonderful) chemistry and playfulness of the stars, is the element of the twists. People's identities keep coming into question - most of all for Grant's character - and it was actually something that remained clever throughout. We can guess that one isn't who he's saying who one is or the other, and it's all thanks to Hepburn, her character and her performance. She's the star, but she's also the audience (at least for the time), trying to piece together things and having to take trust at face value. Of course, who doesn't want to trust Cary Grant? The man at one point takes a shower with his full suit on just to amuse the pretty lady by his side. Again, adorable stuff.If it is kind of a frivolous movie, it's at least presented with gusto, a mostly cracker-jack music score (only one scene, with a fight on a roof-top at night, seemed kind of weakly composed), and the supporting players give as much a boost as do the stars. It's the kind of movie that would be good for a first date, if you have the date that likes movies from Hollywood's 'classic' age before those darn hippies took over. It's elegant, it's flashy, it takes its audience on a ride and we're glad to go on it. The only thing it doesn't do is leave an incredible, lasting impression, which is why it's still Hitchcock-lite ultimately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . and CHARADE is a case in point. Taken as anything but a comic farce, the Byzantine plot Unspooling here is bound to tangle all your brain neurons into knots. Audrey Hepburn plays a slight variation of her "Holly Golightly" character from BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S. She embodies Mrs. Charles (Regina\Reggie) Lampert as an impulsive professional woman, willing to marry any guy who asks, if she at least knows his name. Cary Grant slings up "Peter Joshua," "Alexander Dyle," "Adam Canfield," and "Brian Crookshank" on her wall, figuring he'll eventually get one to stick. As he says he's from crime-ridden Detroit, this makes sense. Everyone in the Motor City from the Georgia Peach to Slim Shady has at least one alias. But a plot that involves a large sum of money whimsically transforming from Nazi gold to furniture and lingerie to expired postage stamps seems more suitable for an episode of BEWITCHED than a spy thriller feature flick. I think that I like the parlor game Charades better than this film incarnation. The acting in the game usually is more believable than what's seen here, and the game's plot is less muddled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charade (1963) was directed by Stanley Donen. It stars Cary Grant as the mysterious Peter Joshua, Audrey Hepburn as the clueless Regina Lampert, and Walter Matthau as Hamilton Bartholemew, the world's dumbest CIA agent.For me, this movie only had one positive aspect--Audrey Hepburn was incredibly beautiful, and she looked great in Givenchy. Other than that, the movie was ridiculous. The plot involves buried treasure--more or less--and three violent men who are as convincing as the Three Stooges, and a supposed chemistry between Grant and Hepburn.The repartee between Hepburn and Grant is about as sparkling as yesterday's ginger ale. The plot is ridiculous, and the denouement is incredibly bad. What I don't understand is how this film can be carrying an extremely high rating of 8.0 from IMDb viewers. My thoughts are that maybe people had a very different outlook about plot in the early 1960's, or they were so dazzled by Hepburn's beauty that they didn't care about the plot.If you want to see this film, it will work well on DVD. However, don't blame me when you get to the part where--in the middle of death and danger--Hepburn asks Grant how he manages to shave in the cleft of his chin. Not kidding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cary Grant is looking wizened and leathery in this 1963 film. By this point in his life, he has clearly spent too much time at tanning salons. His less-than-dashing appearance is accentuated (exacerbated?) by the much younger, cream-colored and waif-like Audrey Hepburn, who however throws herself at Grant's fatherly figure at every available opportunity--that is, whenever she is not eating something. One can only wonder whether she has an extremely overactive thyroid or is perhaps bulimic, given how thin she is, despite eating constantly throughout the film. The story is amusing and lightly entertaining. It's a comedic murder mystery caper whose primary intention appears to be to stoke Cary Grant's ego. Charade was fun to watch, despite my issues with the Audrey Hepburn character, who does not seem to have much of an identity and seeks only to endear herself to the duplicitous Cary Grant character for reasons which remain inscrutable. The film would have been better in black and white, aesthetically speaking. Overall, I'd say that this production is a far cry from Notorious, where a younger Grant becomes romantically entangled with Ingrid Bergman with some similar dynamics in play. Notorious is a film worth watching over and over again. Charade is not.</fullReview>

Every time he seems to earn the trust of Ms.Hepburn, she receives further news that he is never the person he says he is. The ending will really grab you.Interesting, that I just read that the little boy who portrayed Jean-Louis, never made another film again and is now a professor of urology.Hepburn still has that persona of vulnerability on the screen as a woman who really didn't know her husband. When he winds up suddenly dead, she immediately turns to Grant who has suddenly come into her life. When the "gang" goes after her for the loot, go know that Grant is mixed up with them, but in reality he isn't. That's another great facet of the film; it's just filled with surprises that keeps you guessing as to the true culprit in all this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was one of those people who was convinced this was a Hitchcock movie when I first saw "Charade". I think this is because the idea of the plot, some of the set pieces and the style of direction are remarkably similar. The director here is Stanley Donan(co-director with Gene Kelly of "Singin' In The Rain"), and I thought he did a great job directing.The real stars of this classy, entertaining and I think underrated Hitchcockian-like comedy thriller are the clever plot(with an ingenious McGuffin) and the marvellous romantic score from Henry Mancini. The cinematography is skillful enough and the Parisian locations are ravishing. Not to mention some truly wonderful set pieces such as Grant taking a shower fully clothed, Grant and Hepburn falling in love on a river boat, a hair-raising cliffhanger on the roof, the priceless funeral scene and the sequence under the stage.The acting is marvellous, with charming, brooding and urbane Cary Grant and lovely and equally charming Audrey Hepburn making a dream pairing and making the most of a crisp, funny and sophisticated script. James Coburn makes a star-making turn, Ned Glass is deliciously obnoxious and Walter Matthau, a wonderful comic actor in his time, in an understated performance here that I personally think is the strongest one of the film. In fact, while I have nothing against George Kennedy, I did feel as though he was slightly phoning in his performance here, but considering how good this film is that is a minor criticism.Overall, this film is terrific, not the best movie ever made but a long way from the worst. It is such a shame people have to be so derogatory to not only this film in general, but also about Grant, Hepburn and other movie stars like James Stewart when they have a lot more talent than most of the actors working today and that is a fact. Not trying to sound opinionated, but I'd rather watch any Hitchcock or this than any of the Friedberg-Seltzer spoofs or Steven Seagal's most sloppily paced, lazily acted film. 9.5/10 for "Charade".

"Charade" is very enjoyable and very suspenseful, has surprising twists and turns, and has very interesting supportive characters. While watching the movie, I wanted to keep watching to see what would happen next.I was particularly interested in the mystery of whether Cary Grant's character was a good or bad guy. As a viewer, I bonded with the Audrey Hepburn character as she tried to figure out whether Grant was on her side, colluding with her late husband's foes, or a cold-blooded killer and thief."Charade" hooked me so much that I watched it three times and was never bored as I rewatched it. Watching the movie again also gave me an opportunity to look for the clues that I didn't pay attention to the first time. "Charade" was definitely an effective mystery.However, "Charade" was NOT an effective romance. It wasn't credible that Hepburn's character would pursue a man who lied to her constantly, confessed he wanted to steal her husband's $250,000, might have murdered him, and was twice her age. The second he said he was the brother of one of her husband's co-conspirators in the theft of government gold, she should have realized that what appeared to be a chance meeting at a ski resort was, in fact, a reason to suspect he was evil.Hepburn's constant romantic advances were extremely annoying. I blame Grant for the lousy romantic angle because everything I read about this movie says that he would not take the part unless the script was rewritten. Originally, the script had the man pursuing the woman.Director Stanley Donen should have selected someone else to play the male lead ? a 40ish James Bond-type playboy whose roguish charm eventually seduces Hepburn, who should have been resisting a romance for most of the movie. Choosing a celebrity over a script is not a good idea."Charade" also would have been better if Alfred Hitchcock was the director. Donen does a nice job of balancing suspense, humor and sharp dialogue, but the tone is way too light. People are being killed, but the characters don't convey as much fear as they should. They act like bystanders observing the murders from a distance rather than principals who could be the next to perish.These flaws, though, were not something I thought as much about as the mystery. "Who killed Hepburn's husband?" I kept thinking to myself. As "Charade" progressed, my interest in the mystery deepened as the possible murderers were killed themselves and the suspect was not shown. Throughout the movie, the supporting characters played by George Kennedy, Ned Glass, James Coburn, and Walter Matthau were all distinctive, entertaining, and well-developed.Getting immersed in the characters pays off when the writers throw viewers for a loop by making surprising revelations about a couple of them near the end.I realize I've asserted that "Charade" has major flaws, but I'm giving it an 8 because I really enjoyed its primary plot, suspense, and characters.ZWrite</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Stanley Donen (Singin' in the Rain, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Funny Face), I remember seeing this classic caper once or twice, and remembering it being fantastic, so I watched once again to get a definite opinion on it. Basically Regina 'Reggie' Lampert (BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Audrey Hepburn) is due to divorce her husband Charles, but returns from a skiing holiday in Switzerland to Paris where he has been found murdered, thrown from a train, and he apparently left her $250,000 in gold, which has gone missing, she is now trying to find where it is. She meets Peter Joshua (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Cary Grant), well, this is the first name he gives her, he changes his name every fifteen minutes or so, but not so much his back story that there is a Mrs. ?, but they are divorced, anyway, he too is interested in her husband's fortune, which was stolen from the U.S. government during World War II. The husband's former partners in crime: Tex Panthollow (James Coburn), Herman Scobie (George Kennedy) and Leopold W. Gideon (Ned Glass), are staying close to Reggie as well as they are sure she may be hiding the whereabouts of the gold, Peter says that he will help her getaway from them, but in fact he is apparently in cahoots with them to get the money. Reggie and Peter are staying together and following all the clues that would lead to where the money is hidden, but one by one the other searchers are turning up dead, and it is only a matter of time before the killer catches up to them in this charade. CIA administrator Hamilton Bartholemew (Walter Matthau) from the U.S. Embassy is the only one Reggie can trust besides Peter, and although he continues to change his name, from Peter Joshua to Alexander 'Alex' Dyle, to Adam Canfield, and not telling her everything she perhaps wants to know, she cannot help but find herself falling for him, and vice versa. Eventually it is discovered that the fortune is not gold or money at all, the fortune all rests on the value of a bunch of postage stamps, but Peter and Bartholemew have Reggie cornered, and she unsure whether to believe her love interest or the supposed government officer, in the end she goes with her heart, Peter reveals himself to be an investigator in the case of the missing fortune all along, and he assures her she will know his real name on their marriage certificate, Reggie is happy, they will marry once Peter gets the stamps back. Also starring Jacques Marin as Inspector Edouard Grandpierre, Dominique Minot as Sylvie Gaudet and Thomas Chelimsky as Jean-Louis Gaudet. Grant as usual is charming and cool, Hepburn is glamorous and cast well as the woman in the middle, the pairing of them is perfect, supporting cast members Matthau, Coburn and Kennedy all add well to the mix as well, the ravishing Paris locations work well for the story as the search for a hidden fortune goes on, the romantic and tense music by Henry Mancini is great, there are the lovely couple sequences, the exciting action sequences, and there are good moments to laugh at, it all adds up to a satisfying romantic comedy thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for "Charade". Audrey Hepburn was number 13, and Cary Grant number 10 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Grant was number 19 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Grant was number 4 on Britain's Finest Actors, Hepburn was number 3 on Britain's Finest Actresses, Hepburn was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, Grant was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 23 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glamorous, mixed-up 'comedy thriller'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly bizarre early 60s A-list vehicle. The star appeal of Audrey Hepburn ('dressed by Givenchy') and a beautifully aged Cary Grant is undeniable - their chemistry is easy and convincing.There's a serious problem though. The film doesn't know whether it's a comedy or a thriller. The lurches are much greater than in To Catch A Thief. In that similarly Hitchcockian hybrid Grant is a less sympathetic lover and the subterfuge less mortal. Opposite Hepburn, Grant is a clown but also an openly dangerous character. Like Hepburn's neurotic widow the differences are too disparate to dovetail.Well the Grant/Hepburn show really lights up the screen whatever they're supposed to be doing. A secondary impediment however is: an outstanding supporting cast - Kennedy, Coburn and Matthau are very good indeed; excellent shooting, particularly the glorious bateau-mouche and final metro chase sequence; and a forward-looking Henry Mancini score. Even the plot promises more than it delivers. It's all supposed to be a bit more serious than it ends up and so crosses the line confused. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Entertaining Fluff, but It has 1963 Stamped All Over It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Time-Stamped as it May Be, this Mystery/Thriller/Romance/Comedy is Still Quite Enjoyable Today but Could Accurately be Called Overrated. It is Sophisticated Hollywood Star Power Filmmaking with Highly Talented Professionals, In Front of and Behind the Camera, Doing What They Do Best, Make Entertaining Movies.So it is Expected and This Much Talked About Film Seems to Delightfully Surprise Everyone and the Accolades Start Flying. But its Competency is No Surprise and its Delight is Determined Beforehand. It is Simply a Well Crafted Homage to Hitchcock that is Dated with Most of its Charm Highly 1963-ish.The Most Striking Flourish that Seems Progressive is the Way Director Stanley Donen Disposes of the Bad Guys with a Static Scene of Bloody and Terrifying Images. He Pulled that from the Collective Consciousness as Movies were Showing Signs in the Imaginations of Hip Filmmakers that the Code was In Need of a Quick and Decisive Death. But the Codes Demise would Not be Very Quick and Not So Decisive. It Will Take Another Five Years or So and it Would Erode Before it was Laid to Rest.What Makes this Charming Movie Seem Really Dated? Well for One Thing Audrey Hepburn's Clothes, Although by Some Hotshot Designer, are About as Attractive and Sexy as an Egyptian Mummy. Tightly Wrapped from Head to Toe the Attire was Simply Stifling and Dull. Another is the Cute and Cuddly Way the Gary Grant and Hepburn Characters Exchange Highly Witty Banter that Can Only Come Contrived by a Script. Yes, it is Debonaire but Dated and Occasionally Just Silly. The Villains are a Bit Boring and One Dimensional, Stiff and are Caricature, and Two More, The Shower Scene and the Oranges Segments Can Cause a Cringe Today.But Beginning with a Snazzy, Almost Psychedelic Credit Sequence the Movie does Maintain its Intentions for the Two Hours. A Fine Film, but Not Great and Not a Classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why there are dozens of positive review rave pages on here for this is a far deeper mystery than any portrayed in the film itself. While the actors are competent, they are miscast and out of their respective elements in this failed attempt at clever storytelling. You can see the red herrings and twists coming from a kilometer away, and the various plot discontinuities and holes comprise a rolling non sequitur that distracts from the visual appeal of the settings and the people. The Hepburn character's sloppy evolution and transition from innocent/naive/bewildered to savvy/manipulative/covetous disproves the myth of an educated actress stopping filming to ask: "What is my motivation?" Such a question seems never to have entered anyone's mind at any stage of the proceedings. Much less an answer. I had recorded it off High Def satellite onto High Def digital tape, but will be driving over it with something better now that we managed to sit through the entire thing squirming in our barcaloungers hoping it would get more meaningful but being profoundly disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Failed to deliver on the promise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie starts on a very promising note, but somewhere along the lines it takes the wrong turn and becomes an insufferable mess of a third rate screenplay/acting. It's almost impossible to grasp how could such a gaffe occur on such a well produced project. Obviously, whoever was in charge was asleep at the wheel, and then they dropped the ball.Too bad, because the movie in its first 30 - 40 minutes promised top-notch entertainment. The dialogs were witty and pithy, the acting was right on the money, the pace was brisk and airtight. Alas, all that fell by the wayside the moment the movie turned into a romance- wannabe. The main female protagonist is as sexy as a cold dead fish, and the aging male protagonists (Grant) is barely plodding along.Another huge opportunity missed. Anyway, watch it for the opening 40 minutes, enjoy the excellent cabaret music in the "pass the orange" sequence, and then push the eject button.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is supposed to be a comedy thriller. However, like most American Romantic / Sophisticated comedies of the 60s and earlier, it is not funny! The dialogue (I am sure) must be clever and (at times) amusing but not funny. Perhaps the comedy is that a man of advancing years (Cary Grant was 59) could convince a young lady (Audrey Hepburn was 34) that, no matter how many times he lied to her about who he was, she was still in love with him (whoever he was at the time!). Ignoring the absurdity of all that means that we have a pretty good thriller with top class actors (Grant, Hepburn and the magnificent Matthau). I enjoyed it enough to give it five but, after seeing all the rave revues, I expected more. DON'T believe all you read about it, it's not top drawer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie pretends to be Hitchcockian. It's not.It lacks the subtle camera work and character analysis which make Hitch's work special. It also lacks Bernard Hermann's music, which goes a bit farther towards creating a psychological mood.This movie aims for style and hits the mark. But you can find Hitch movies which do that and a whole lot more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was so good about this film? Take a wild guess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's sad, sleepy, cheesy and dated.Yes, even for the 60's this little piece of fluff was exactly that - fluff.The characters were so poorly developed and the plot was just stupid and asinine. Audrey Hepburn was so pathetic and unbelievable and just overdone. Gary Grant was also a mess and his character(s) were just retarded to all capacity.Audrey Hepburn's character takes women back to the early quarter of the century - turning them into helpless lovelorn suckers for a man. The Paris location had nothing to do with the film, the rest of the story blends into something so horrible and the action is barely existent. It's just horrible on so many levels.There is one magical piece in here - it's the setting under the stage floor - which is a real masterpiece in the entire film - quite unique in the entire film era of the 60's and to some degree - even 40 something years later.Aside of that fantastic little segment, this movie is a dismal mark on cinematic history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hepburn/Grant Good; Movie Not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The chemistry between Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant is about the only thing Stanley Donen's comedy thriller has going for it, despite its fine supporting cast (including James Coburn, Walter Matthau, Ned Glass and George Kennedy) and luxurious Paris setting. This is one of those early Sixties films where the plot (money stolen by Hepburn's murdered husband is sought by a variety of dubious characters) was viewed as adult sophistication for a discerning audience but in retrospect is really contrived and stupid, with absolutely no plausibility. At least it works as a framework for the spontaneous and intimate interplay between Hepburn and Grant, who seem so smitten with each other that they're happy to digress from Peter Stone's meaningless screenplay to flirt heavily. (At one point, Hepburn hilariously interrupts Grant to ask how he manages to shave his cleft chin.) The score by Henry Mancini, including the now-famous title song (with lyrics by Johnny Mercer), is actually pretty good--dark, mature jazz that's more memorable than Donen's disinterested direction, a minor effort from a worthwhile filmmaker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This slow, dated and boring film is just a poor variation on earlier films like "North by Northwest". Cary Grant was far too old and paunchy (he had to try to disguise his age and excess weight by taking a shower fully dressed in a stupid, unfunny sequence). Hepburn could never act and her awful overacting quickly becomes very annoying. Probably the worst thing however is the fact that the story is so obvious and contrived. It is so obvious who the villain is from the very beginning of the movie. Grant should have retired before this rubbish. Both stars were too old for their parts, the film should have been made with Warren Beatty and Natalie Wood, as was originally intended.0/10.</fullReview>
