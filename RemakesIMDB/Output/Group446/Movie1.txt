		<shortDescription>An Insult to a Great Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mystery films come and go; a precious few stand the test of time. "Charade,' for my money the greatest whodunit ever made, is a masterpiece of tone, miraculously blending the disparate elements of suspense, humor and romance more successfully than any film I've ever seen. Enhanced by the dashing beauty and charisma of its two stars, Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant, the sophisticated wit of its ingenious script, the shimmering beauty of its on-location photography, and, of course, the classic strains of its Henry Mancini score, "Charade" is a movie that one can enjoy no matter how many times one has seen it.I wonder how many people will be saying the same thing about `The Truth About Charlie' - Jonathan Demme's utterly pointless remake of this great film - four decades from now (the original title, `Charade,' is actually more appropriate because the story deals with lies, deception and falsehoods in general and not just in relation to that particular character). I have absolutely no idea how anyone unfamiliar with the original work will respond to this film. I can just say that, for diehard devotees of the 1963 Stanley Donen classic, `The Truth About Charlie' is a travesty on every level imaginable. (And, alas, that great Henry Mancini score is nowhere to be found on this version's soundtrack, the first of many strikes against this modern rehash).Although this new version shares the basic plot premise of the original, it has completely eliminated most of the elements that made `Charade' such a world-class, timeless charmer. First of all, in what universe could Mark Wahlberg and Thandia Newton possibly be considered replacements for Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, two of the greatest screen legends of all time? Yes, Ms. Newton has a certain attractiveness and appeal at times, but her one-note expression of pouting bemusement does grow tiresome after awhile. The real trouble, however, comes with Wahlberg, a fine actor who has turned in some impressive film performances in the past, but who is just plain disastrous in this part. His character is supposed to be a suave, debonair gentleman who attempts to win Reggie's confidence after her husband has been murdered for stealing $6 million and she becomes the hapless target of a band of hooligans who want their share and who believe she knows where it is. Wahlberg has never looked more uncomfortable or out of place than he does here, trying to appear `sincere' and `concerned, ' but coming across as merely epicene and amateurish. This is, in fact, the worst case of miscasting I have seen in a film in a long, long time. How can one have a remake of `Charade' - of all films! - with two stars who lack charisma and generate zero romantic chemistry when they're together on screen? Even more detrimental, perhaps, is the fact that virtually all the wonderful humor from the original script has been excised, a strange turn of events indeed considering the fact that the original writer, Peter Stone, also had a hand in this venture (here he has assumed the pseudonym of `Peter Joshua,' one of the names ascribed to the Grant character in the earlier film, although the name, for no apparent reason, has been inverted for Wahlberg). The very few comic lines that have been retained are delivered so poorly by the actors that we wince every time we hear them. So now we have a remake of `Charade' utterly devoid of humor and romance. What else could go wrong? Well, in the original, the secondary characters all stood out as finely drawn figures in their own right. The three men chasing Reggie for the money ? James Coburn, Ned Glass and Arthur Kennedy ? had each a retinue of fascinating personality quirks that helped distinguish one character from the other. In `Charlie,' the three `villains' not only comprise a blandly homogenous group, but they do not even remain consistent as characters. The most egregious example is Lola (Lisa Gay Hamilton) who spends the entire film bullying and threatening Regina, then inexplicably and in a matter of minutes, becomes some sort of heroine whom Regina comes to love and admire. It makes no sense at all. The concluding scene, in which the characters all meet up together to reveal their true identities and unravel the mystery, is so ham-handed in its execution that one wonders if the filmmakers ever even saw the flawlessly executed Donen original. It is the low point in a film made up of little else but low points. Demme has also injected an idiotic plot strand involving Reggie's husband's insane mother, but the less said about that the better. In fact, one suspects that the sole reason for this storyline is to allow the director to feature famed French director Agnes Varda in a cameo role. Indeed, `Charlie' is filled with all sorts of pointless homages to French culture in general and the French New Wave in particular, including a clip from Truffaut's `Shoot the Piano Player' and a truly bizarre cabaret scene with famed Jean Luc Godard actress Anna Karina belting out a song while the characters perform a surreal tango that throws us out of the film's world completely. In fact, Demme has tried to recreate much of the style of 60's cinema by employing a camera that rarely ever sits still and a razzle-dazzle editing technique that attempts to substitute style for substance. The effort is too self-consciously cutesy to be even slightly effective.This does, however, bring us to the one undeniable element of value in `The Truth About Charlie': Tak Fujimoto's eye-popping cinematography, which does a superlative job bringing out the colorful richness of the Paris setting.A word of praise to anything or anyone else involved in this production would, however, be excessive. Demme has taken a film that just about defines the word `style' and turned it into a hollow, soulless exercise utterly devoid of wit, suspense, romance and star charisma ? all the elements in fact that made `Charade' such a golden, timeless treasure. Avoid the theaters and head to the nearest video store to pick up a copy of `Charade' - and see what a great film is really all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jonathan, how could you?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie. Jonathan Demme is one of my favorite film makers and I thought if anyone could remake one of my favorite movies of all time, Demme could. Demme couldn't.Newton and Robbins are ok, Wahlberg doesn't work at all, and the other "evil" characters who were so memorable in Charade come across as interchangeable cyphers.I usually like Demme's music selection, but here there didn't seem to be any sort of unifying theme behind his music. And, it certainly wasn't Mancini's wonderful score.But the biggest Truth about Charlie is that Demme's rewrite is simply awful.In the original, Charlie is a nobody and so he doesn't get in the way of all the other characters. Here he has a face and is, apparently, the big villain, so we have to be treated to a slew of foggy flashbacks that halt the flow of the story.Newton and Wahlberg lip-lock so early, there's absolutely none of the playful sexual tension of the original. And, instead of Grant's cocky, end-of-the-film surprise, we get a bathetic Wahlberg begging Newton to forgive him. Bleacch.The reworking of the story that sets everything in motion is so muddled I'm still not sure just exactly what was happening and why.And the final big thing missing is the element of wonderful surprise Donen crafted so well. In the original Grant's multiple characters are peeled back with delicious surprise at each new revelation ending with the final, perfect surprise at the end of the film. And the moment when the original film reveals the big secret is still thrilling, even after watching it a dozen times. In Charlie, the big secret becomes a tiny flicker of something in Newton's eyes and when it is finally revealed, it's a moment that the word "anticlimax" was designed for.It's such a shame that Demme made such a muddle of something that originally was so clean and clearly presented. As so many others have done, I strongly recommend you skip this one and just go back to the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>REVIEW: The Truth About Charlie, for IMDB, July 13, 2004As "rosscinema" says in a previous post, "Why did they bother?" Well, they bothered for the same reason virtually all Hollywood films are made: to make **MONEY**, lots of MONEY! No one in their right mind would attempt to duplicate two so magic stars as Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn from the original "Charade", but some studio type thought they could cost in on the deserved reputation of the original for excellence, and make a bundle before the critics and the public got to see what a stinker this would-be remake is. Mark Wahlberg may have a certain presence, but a Cary Grant his is NOT and never will be; and that woman taking Hepburn's part was simply pathetic, what with her little moues of pseudo-British mouthings. Audrey, who was the quintessence of delicate dignity and charm, would spin in her grave, if she could. And with the change of dating to reflect, not the Second World War, but post-Vietnam, the entire tenor of the original was changed from a charming 'escapade-avec-larceny', to a mad chase with the modern dictum of 'diversity' with a cast more suited to a tract on multiculturalism, than anything having to do with telling a coherent story! The 'stamps' were well explained in the original, but here they are a throwaway plot device that more confuses than illuminates. And 'la belle Paris', mon Dieu, how it is ignored and abused in this tawdry effort; what was charming even in the face of murder and crime in the original, is merely seedy here. There is no magic between the stars as in "Charade", just some groping. And where was the duplicate of the crafty Walter Matthau character? Tim Robbins is a good actor, but here he is no replacement for the Mr. Dyle. And that dismal woman who is the police inspector is merely awful in this tiresome flick. If you have never seen "Charade" you must not let this failure make you think the original is as bad, for you would be denying yourself one of the finest delights of the modern screen, and the sight of two of its greatest luminaries, Grant and Hepburn, in very good form!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Case in point: Johnathan DemmeI watched "The Truth About Charlie," last night. This is a remake of "Charade," a perennial favorite among lovers of Hitchcock-style thrillers. Made in 1963, Charade is something of an artifact, as it seems to have been made on the cusp of two eras: Old Hollywood vs. New Hollywood. It stars Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, both in the later stages of their film careers. Yet its tone and humor predate a more modern and sophisticated sensibility. One that would become increasingly cynical over time.In fact, I actually rented "The Truth About Charlie" DVD to re-watch "Charade," which I hadn't seen in many years. Apparently, some marketing wag came up with the bright idea to distribute "The Truth About Charlie" DVD with the complete version of "Charade" on the flip-side of the DVD. It worked for me. It would have never occurred to me to rent the DVD if it didn't afford me the opportunity to watch "Charade" again.Unfortunately, I also decided to watch the remake. Which brings me to the crux of the matter. While I was watching this disjointed, disfigured, and disgusting resemblance to a movie, it occured to me that this thing had been directed by Johnathan Demme. The same Johnathan Demme who directed "Something Wild," "Married to the Mob," and "Silence of the Lambs." How was it possible that this formerly superb craftsman of edgy, intense, character-driven films could cobble together something so ungainly, unraveled, and unprofessional? The movie literally looked as if it had been shot by a rank amateur who knew nothing about the film production process. The film didn't make any sense. In simple terms, it was execrable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Truth About Charlie' Is a wholly unnecessary re-take of the Stanley Donen Classic Charade. Mark Wahlberg,is no Cary Grant. Thandie Newton, looks as if she walked In to the wrong production, Tim Robbins, appears as a US embassy official who phones in his performance. The only interesting thing about this waste of celluloid is the Parisian locations. It's a rather tedious film that goes to show.if it ain't broke don't fix it. I managed to see this flick on its brief run, it vanished in the space of a week, i wonder why. One word of advice rent or buy the superb original Charade Cary Grant Audery Hepburn, Iam sure Cary Grant would turn in his grave! This one should be filed under unnecessary remakes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was strange. I had no idea what this film was about as it was a free loan and I just put in the machine, not even reading the back of the box. Well, obviously it didn't take long to figure out this was a re-make of the famous 1963 film "Charade."It's not really bad on it's own but if you've watched and admired Charade a half dozen times as I have, this film isn't even close measuring up. Mark Wahlberg is no Cary Grant; Thandie Newton is no Audry Hepburn and Tim Robbins in no Walter Matthau.Why settle for second-rate after having first-rate? I mean, why even bother? It's not like you are updating some old black-and-white movie to accommodate today's crowd which won't look at B&amp;W. The original still looks good (on the Criterion DVD).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All over the map -- it doesn't know what it wants to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At a recent Q &amp; A session, director Jonathan Demme said he had a difficult time finding the right tone the film. Having seen the picture, I can tell you -- he still hasn't found it.The movie, a remake of the 1963 Cary Grant-Audrey Hepburn classic Charade, may take place mostly in Paris, but it's really all over the map. It doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it a comedy? Is it a romance? Is it a thriller? For a time it tries to be all of the above -- and fails at each one.Demme, speaking to an audience in Philadelphia following an advance screening, said the movie could have gone in vastly different directions in the editing room. For example, another version could have been much funnier. I don't doubt it. There are some good elements in place.Mark Wahlberg, stepping into the Cary Grant role, is surprisingly debonair. This role officially puts him light-years away from his early '90s white-rapper persona. Don't get me wrong, he's still no Cary Grant -- but watching him in this film, you can easily see him as an American James Bond.Following in Audrey Hepburn's heels is the to-die-for Thandie Newton. Combining beauty, sophistication, elegance and vulnerability, Newton more than succeeds in bringing a Hepburn-like quality to her character. She also gets boatloads more screen time than Wahlberg, which isn't a bad thing considering she's the best thing in the movie.If only the story didn't fall apart in the second act, as all tension and suspense evaporates. Things come back together in the third act, but it's too late.The movie also exceeds its quota of cliches. For instance, how many times have you seen foreigners in movies begin conversations in another language -- only to switch into perfect English after a couple of sentences? Well, in this movie, get ready to see it again... and again.Then there's the car accident scene -- we hear squealing brakes and crunching metal off-screen, then Demme actually gives us a shot of a hub cap rolling across the street! The movie gives us no indication these bits are meant to be tongue-in-cheek.There is one terrific foot chase that Demme admits is inspired by Run Lola Run. The scene has energy, suspense, humor and fun -- all things the rest of the movie tries, but fails to achieve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so I didn't waste eight bucks at the box office, nor did I spend four bucks at Blockbuster; luckily, I had credit at Netflix.com so I didn't spend a dime to see this latest of Hollywood remakes. Apparently very few screenwriters can come up with original ideas, so we wind up with a new version of an old favorite month after month. I hope that Mr. Demme is out of rehab by now, because he must've been on some kind of delusional trip when he got the idea to remake a classic. I've read all the reviews posted here at IMDB, and for the life of me I cannot see the rants and raves for Thandie Newton. Poor child, why didn't her mother tell her NOT to attempt to recreate an Audrey Hepburn role? She has about as much cinematic charisma as a pile of sawdust. Early in the movie when she's standing between the French Commandant and the Lieutenant, Ms. Newton completely disappears. I was watching the Lt. more than the star of the picture. Seeing the extras on the DVD, Mr. Demme proclaimed he was looking for the right vehicle for Ms. Newton's talent (or did he have more prurient interests in her off camera?). The worst scene was the gunpoint standoff which I found myself looking at my watch, wondering how long could this go on? I've always been a huge fan of Tim Robbins, but what in heaven's name, was the accent he was trying to use? I can't blame Mark Wahlberg, he chomped at the bit to play a romantic lead. Damn! Had he never seen the original film and realized whom he would be compared to? This was truly sad. There's no reason to continue tearing this piece of schlock frame by frame, but the closing credits??? Mr. Demme chose to dedicate this to his late brother...who's surely rolling over in his grave from this. Ms. Portman's music even had to use the Mancini theme to compensate for her lack of originality. Then, I wouldn't have believed this if I hadn't seen it...someone at Universal Pictures had the gall to put the original "Charade" on the flip side of the "Charlie" DVD. Stupidity? Insanity? Audacity? There is NO word for it! God! What a mess!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In an overall comparison between the "Charade" and `Charlie,' the latter is the imposter-no ambiguity intended.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So Cary grant and Audrey Hepburn are unfortunately dead. That means director Jonathan Demme (`Silence of the Lambs') must find suitable replacements for his remake of `Charade' called `The Truth about Charlie.' Will Smith was his first choice-Mark Wahlberg (`Planet of the Apes') took the Grant role. Thandi Newton (`Mission Impossible 2') plays Hepburn's role. Neither carries the film, which requires a certain amount of international sophistication and charm.Set in Paris, `The Truth about Charlie' starts with a murder and the victim's money, which everyone seems to want. It has touches of the old American love of Paris, e.g., the tower appears regularly. But it is a more modern Paris than the original film's: Cinematographer Tak Fujimoto (`Signs' `The Silence of the Lambs') said, `We wanted to make the city feel mysterious and scary. We wanted it overcast and gray-different from the traditional view of Paris, more realistic, more paranoid.'A Ferris-wheel scene with Wahlberg and Tim Robbins, who reprises the Walter Matthau role, evokes the mystery and danger of Sir Carol Reed's `Third Man.' That most American of images, the incarcerated Hannibal Lecter, ends the film with a fitting tribute to his invulnerability.Back to Wahlberg and Newton. The success of the film, then and now, rests with the leads, and they failed. Wahlberg is flat, expressionless, 2 dimensional. Newton lacks the acting chops to navigate the aftershocks of a husband's murder and the barrage of interest in his money, hidden somewhere in plain sight. Robbins comes closest to a screen presence, part mountebank, part protector, and part enigma.The original title `Charade' better expresses the delicious ambiguity of European intrigue where nothing is as it seems, and people are not what they appear. In this regard, `Charlie' fulfills the promise. For a modern look, it also succeeds. But in an overall comparison between the 2 films, `Charlie' is the imposter-no ambiguity intended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Ridiculous Remake of 'Charade' !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema is art, therefore is not to be copied. Nobody copies a Picasso or a successful romance, for example. No matter how similar it could be, it would be a copy of an artistic piece without any value. Therefore, remakes of great movies are totally unnecessary. The original 'Charade' was not a masterpiece, but a great movie, with a charming central pair (Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant) and funny situations and dialogues. But this 'The Truth About Charlie' is really ridiculous. Beginning with the choice of the lead actress and actor. Thandie Newton and Mark Wahlberg performing the roles of Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant respectively is outrageous. The modifications in the original plot made the delight of 'Charade' be lost. Do not waste your time with this film, rent or buy the original one. By the way, I have a friend who knows by heart many dialogues of the original 'Charade'. Jonathan Demme has not probably paid attention on the wonderful original text, otherwise he would try at least to reproduce some of them. My vote is four.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was one of the most insulting movies I've ever seen! Not only does it not follow the plot of "Charade", but it's also inconsistent and doesn't make much sense! For an example, what happened to Tex Panthollow, Leopold W. Gideon, and Herman Scobie? These new "villains" are nothing but awful, and the least bit funny. One of the best parts of "Charade" were the memorable quotes, and The Truth About Charlie failed to use any of them. You just cannot remake a movie without following the plot, using at least some of the original dialogue, and using the same names. For whatever reason, the director decided to change "Peter Joshua" to "Joshua Peters", and made him "Mr. Bartholemew's brother". Also, aren't ALL the villains supposed to end up being ? Charade had the most amazing cast-Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant. James Coburn, Walter Matthau, Ned Glass, and George Kennedy were amazing as well. "You greenhorn! ... You fell for it like an egg from a tall chicken!" who could forget quotes like that? If you've seen Charade, I guarantee you will NOT like The Truth About Charlie. Charade fans, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrible remake of a great classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Truth About Charlie' is not worthy to be a remake of the great 'Charade'. To be honest, I don't even get why they had to remake that film since it still works today, both as a Hitchcockian thriller and as comedy. But they did remake it, and where the original film stars Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, two of the greatest stars in the movies, this film gives us Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton. Personally I like Wahlberg, especially in 'Boogie Nights', 'Three Kings' and later film 'The Departed', but apparently this role was for Grant only; Wahlberg does not pull it off. For me personally Newton ruined the film. I never understood whether this film contained the comedic elements as they were in 'Charade' or not, but whatever it was, it felt weird and out of place. Mainly, Newton's performance was the cause of this.The second distraction comes from Paris as the setting. Director Jonathan Demme, who has lost most of his 'The Silence of the Lambs'-touch, is too much in love with it. By now the world has seen the Eiffel Tower, and for that matter has heard Charles Aznavour (who appears from time to time), and the film does not realize this. If the story is only a backdrop for a place and an atmosphere, at least show us elements of both things we are not acquainted with. The story, by the way, deals with Newton as Regina Lambert who finds out Charlie, her husband for three months, now dead, used to lead more than one life. Apparently he had six million dollars in diamonds and now the French police, a couple of former soldiers who fought with Charlie, and a character played by Tim Robbins are after it. Mark Wahlberg's character named Joshua Peters pops up everywhere Newton seems to need him, meaning his role will stay vague as long as the film wants it to be.When the closing scenes finally arrived I did not care anymore. Who was who and why and for what reason; it didn't matter to me, I was just glad the film was over. The final scenes were supposed to have some suspense in it, but even that was spoiled by annoying close-ups and many cuts. I have seen quite some bad films over the years but this time I was really amazed with such good material wasted in such a complete way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The DVD for this film has an interesting twist. On one side is "The Truth about Charlie", and on the other side is "Charade", of which it is a remake. The opportunity for side-to-side comparison is interesting.That said: Mark Wahlberg is not an adequate surrogate for Cary Grant, but Thandie Newton does a good job in the Audrey Hepburn role. Several of the modernized elements (e.g. bad guys of various races and genders) are refreshing, but overall the original's stylishness and charm win the day.Good, but not very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK...THAT was weird...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charade is an inconsequential but lovable classic. The Truth About Charlie is just weird.I don't fault Demme for trying to rework Charade into something more contemporary. It could have been a fun, interesting exercise. But the product is neither fun nor interesting, except in spurts.Charade was a romantic-comedy-thriller, with an emphasis on the romantic comedy. It wasn't serious in any way -- for example, while the bad guys were not nice, they provided more comic relief than menace. It was light, mildly suspenseful, and anything but realistic. What's wrong with that? (As Regina would say, "Absolutely nothing.")The Truth About Charlie can't decide what it's supposed to be. How can a movie make so many homages to its predecessor (and films from completely disparate '60s genres like French New Wave) and still try to be a Mission: Impossible-like action-adventure for the 21st Century? And why, after following the plot of Charade almost scene-by-scene for half the movie, does it diverge from original in ways that make it less cohesive AND less suspenseful?And the showdown at the end? (***Mild spoiler here, if you care...***)On the DVD commentary, Demme said he wanted to avoid having the characters use guns to solve problems -- that's why the hero gets to play hostage negotiator and talk down the situation -- but why, then, did Demme film it like a John Woo 21-gun standoff scene? The "reveal" was horrible. The supposed motivation for Dyal was ridiculous. The whole last third stunk.Not that the rest was that great. Thandie Newton has star quality and was a good pick to update an Audrey Hepburn role, which makes casting an anti-Cary like Mark Wahlberg even more absurd. Wahlberg can be appealing in earnest and earthy roles, but why on earth would Regina Lampert find him attractive? Tim Robbins in the Walter Matthau role (complete with a trace Matthau accent) is rather funny until the showdown scene, which ruins him. The three pursuers are more diverse in a PC way than the originals, but their personalities are much less distinct. And why bother with giving the French police roles more play when they don't end up being more than mildly useful to the plot? Argh!Now for the good part: Interesting camera work and new-Paris soundtrack. I imagine many other fans of Charade would hate those changes from the original, but they worked for me, and would have been great assets if the story had been better told and cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Almost every comment about this movie goes into great detail in how disjointed and awful this remake is and I wholeheartedly agree with all the condemnation. What is amazing to me is that Roger Ebert's review states that while the original "Charade" has been voted the 168th best film ever he thinks this catastrophic abomination is justified because Thandie Newton photographs well. The attempts to bring bits of French films into the remake are an insult as all the original film fit the pattern of a standard American thriller, the only connection to France being the location. Nearly all of the humor of Cary Grant, like his line about leaving a bad guy hanging around American Express, almost a precursor to some of Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry or Swartaneggar's wise cracks were completely omitted. This film should not only have gotten a thumbs down but should have been Hanniblized.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charade it's not but it's also wrong to claim it's an 'insult' to Charade. Things have changed. Unfortunately. The subtle elegance of the 1963 classic is not going to get popcorn eating PFYs to go to the movies.There are a lot of things here that make no sense. Plot elements if you will - except they're not plot elements. They're just thrown in for the heck of it. Not good planning.No sights to see either, despite this being Paris. And what you do see of the sights flashes past in all this very pseudo-classy mishmash that is the makeup of MTV.It's a bit like taking the original story, setting it to agitated arabian beat music, and then chopping it up in small vignettes that even by themselves don't make a lot of sense.A lot of people think this is Thandie's movie. Not necessarily so. There are a lot of good people in here and you may find you feel others come across more convincing and sympathetic.There are plot holes and plot devices too which make no sense. Yet to rate it a '4' is too low whilst a '5' seems a bit too high.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*possible spoilers*first time I'm writing a review on here, and only because the movie was that bad. [I have yet to see the original (Charade) but will soon, and I highly doubt it is a waste of film like the remake.]Why was this movie so bad? For one, the acting. Tim Robbins surprising was horrible. He read his lines like he was being forced to make the movie at gunpoint. There was very little character development, Thandie Newton and Mark Wahlberg somehow fell in love with each other in 5 minutes. Despite the fact that Mark Wahlberg constantly lies to her, and she has reason to believe he has bad intentions, she still flirts with him the entire movie.Another major flaw with the movie was that it was full of actions that made no sense. Imagine an action movie where the unarmed hero passes up every oppurtunity to pick up a gun, 500 times. The protagonist meets people out to get her deceased husband's money any way possible, and is friendly to them halfway through the movie, for no reason. Though she supposedly trusts no one, her actions show her taking everything at face value. She is approached by a man claiming to be from a US agency, only she never checks to see if this is true, even with the french police.It's also worth mentioning that Robbins was not the only one who gave a poor performance. Wahlberg was extremely bland, and the 3 other people after Regina's money gave lackluster performances, adding very little to the movie.That all said, what really bugged me about this movie was how pretentious it was. It pretended to be an artsy French movie, only it wasn't. Especially in poor taste were the scenes where performer singing the song in the background would then appear in the movie. Even worse were the actors acknowledging his presence.In summary, if the plot on the box intrigues you, save yourself the frustration and watch the original, it's on the other side of the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read some of the comments, and how they went on and on comparing that movie with Charade. I saw Charade some years ago and really enjoyed it. Watched The Truth About Charlie on TV last week and thoroughly enjoyed it for the film it was. OK, I had a blonde moment and didn't realise I was watching a remake..The romantic in me really enjoyed the vulnerability displayed by Mark Wahlberg in the last scene.. Made me reach for my Charade DVD to watch the last scene of that movie and I found Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn to be terribly over-acting but then maybe that was the way to act in those days.I really enjoyed The Truth About Charlie, found it a bit over the top, but it looked like the actors did it on purpose and had fun with it. I found Regina really too trusting but she played the game as well and kept her cards close to her chest, just like the other characters.Very entertaining and a great cast. Would like to see it again, without the commercial breaks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fortunately I saw this pathetic production as free inflight "entertainment" and none of my money will go as a "vote" towards any sort of approval. Forget comparisons to the delightful "Charade", this film would be a total dud even if it had been released as a brand new entry. The word inept can be applied to almost every aspect. The script is so muddled that it is hard to really know what is going on at times, and boring when the plot does emerge. The acting generally matches the script, and the direction is worse. Intrusive and obnoxious camera moves are everywhere, and make it impossible to enjoy any of the location shooting. The "stars" have absolutely no "star power" or charisma, so why show their inadequacies in so many tight close-ups ? The choice of Mark Wahlburg is the worst miscast since Sofia Coppola in The Godfather Part III. Tim Robbin's amateurish imitation of Walter Matthau's speech inflections is at least an attempt at a performance, but laughable if meant to be taken seriously. It comes off like a Saturday Night Live parody. The music is completely forgettable and does nothing to supplement the film. I have never missed Henry Mancini more than while watching this mess of sight and sound.And be honest, how many movies slither to such an anti-climatic climax as this one does ? ...with the added irony that this is a re-make of a film with one of the better endings in film history ?"Charade" is a film that works on every level, this film does not work at all. It is interesting that the same plot could yield such vastly different results. I give it 1 out of 10, only because there is no "zero" option. This is one of the 100 worst films I have ever seen.This film makes the dogs sit up and say "bow wow"...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gus Van Sant made a great remake of Psycho because it's carbon copy of the original. But what was the point.That said, remakes should be different while still retaining the spirit of the original. The film isn't as funny or clever as the original, but still adds some cool scenes. People are complaining about Mark Wahlberg isn't Cary Grant. Yes, Cary Grant was incredibly suave and debonair. That doesn't mean that Wahlberg's character has to be. He just needs to be likeable and mysterious, not James Bond.I was always wanted to see the original remade because it's a hidden gem and hopefully more people will rent the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The director Jonathan Demme who made Silence of the Lambs (1991) and Philadelphia (1993) counts on Thandie Newton (Regina Lambert) and her whirling charms to give this movie its specific attraction of its own. The camera-work of Tak Fujimoto is doing a lot to give the special atmosphere of Paris but Charles Aznavour does not add something to the evocation of Paris. The director has something for the Nouvelle Vague but it didn't work that good in the movie. The last scene with the policemen all around the suspect is awful and without interest. The mother of the suspect who comes up a few times has no real identity and she is useless. The story is not something that you can believe, you just are not captivated by the development of the truth and I was never really surprised. The acting of the bad guys and of Mark Wahlberg (Joshua Peters) is insufficient with the exception of Tim Robbins (Bartholomew). The original movie by Stanley Donen Charade (1963), with Audrey Hepburn and Carry Grant, had its own electricity that can never be surpassed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton were miscast. Both could give good performances but their talents were wasted in this movie. The chemistry between them was off. The love scenes were not a bit convincing. I did not believe Mark Wahlberg was the character he played and I keep thinking why does she continue to believe this guy. Thandie Newton portrayal of Regina Lampert was inconsistent. She was not believable. After life-threatening events she quickly turned light hearted. I expected her to break out into song. When the lead characters are not convincing the movie has a big obstacle to overcome. Fortunately the supporting cast was good. Tim Robbins, Lisa Gay Hamilton, and Christine Boisson were effective in their roles. The cinematography was irritating. Why film the movie in Paris? With the camera jumping around so much and with the quick edits it could have be filmed anywhere. Filler shots of the Eiffel tower had to be included so you would know where you were. Quick cuts, extreme closeups and odd angles were used to make the scenes more interesting. Shouldn't the story provide the interest? The movie was filled with irritating details which is a shame since it did have some good performances and an interesting background. If only they would have lingered more on the Parisian setting the movie may have been worthwhile. What am I saying? If the story would have been more coherent and consistent I wouldn't have noticed the background. Wait until this movie comes out on DVD then get it on a rent one get one free night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imdb lists twenty "truth about" titles, ranging from two in 1915 through two this year. The second of the latter is "...About Beef Jerky." Thandie Newton could have played the 1963 role against Cary Grant with much difference yet no loss, but Robbins and Wahlberg might have might have done better to have exchanged roles. Robbins' resemblance to the young Orson Wells seems to cue the merry-go-round segment here, but Wahlberg comes across as the only non-adult in the cast. The tango scene's a highpoint Wahlberg doesn't quite spoil.This is one of those films that demands you stay through most of the closing credits, as little things keep happening. Aznavour sings over them, so it's painless.</fullReview>

As the star, Thandie Newton does a great job of carrying the plot along and is charming in every way. Mark Wahlberg doesn't hurt or help the movie, giving a fairly undistinguished performance. The normally solid Tim Robbins overdoes the stiffness and pomposity of Walter Matthau's part. Overall, I would tell my friends to skip the big screen and rent it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing, Nice Parisian Scenes, NOT a Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Truth About Charlie" may owe its birth to the classic Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn "Charade" but it's no remake. No one can replicate the performance AND the era of "Charade." In place of the suave Grant we have the awkward Mark Wahlberg as Joshua Peters. The Walter Matthau character here is cynical-on-demand Tim Robbins as Mr. Bartholomew. And the naive, vulnerable and enormously and ever appealing "I wish she was my kid sister" Audrey Hepburn falls way to the post-modern "This can't be happening to me - oh yeah it is!" Thandie Newton as the briefly married Regina Lampert. Newton is the film's saving grace.The basic story line is the same in both films. Here Regina Lampert is a widow, her husband having left a moving train without wanting to. She may be in possession of $6M in diamonds that her mysterious hubby shouldn't have had. Of course both a gang of sinister neer-do-wells and a representative of a mysterious branch of the U.S. government seek what they view as rightfully theirs, the treasure. The boss of the gang is a health nut who does yeoman service in one scene showing the evils of allowing smoking in public. And Regina Lampert must decide, scene to scene, who's her friend and who's out to get a cache she doesn't have. Or so she thinks.Director Jonathan Demme plays out the transience - real or imagined - of many contemporary relationships. The film begins with Regina enjoying a respite on a Caribbean beach while remarking to a friend, without sadness or joy, that it's time for her to end her three-month marriage. Can you imagine Audrey Hepburn ever doing that?The return of the British spouse to her Paris apartment launches the unfolding comedy/drama. At times the leading cast members don't seem to be sure which genre the scene calls for. Tim Robbins, a fine actor, must have been saying to himself, "Who am I?" Am I real or a caricature?" Wahlberg seems to be genuinely confused at times as to which side he's supposed to be on. Police Commandant Dominique (Christine Boisson) is alternately seductive and professional.The cinematography is impressive with Paris sights filmed from sharp and interesting angles. To lend a bit of surrealism Charles Azvanour portrays himself in scenes that I suspect aren't supposed to make sense. In any event, they don't.Demme tried too hard here when he might have been better off scrapping the project. Notwithstanding that, this film is amusing enough to warrant attending on a rainy day when the bargain matinee is offered (as it was for me today). Thandie Newton IS very good and her acting saves much of the film. She projects just the right admixture of vulnerability, desirability, gullibility, fear and sensuality. She definitely did not try to copy Audrey Hepburn!5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...Now with Thandie Newton as Hepburn, Mark Wahlberg as Cary Grant, and Tim Robbins as Walter Matthau. The first works, the second doesn't, and the third is good yet could've been better, and these are three of the characters in Jonathan Demme's cinema excersize in Paris. While Paris itself casts a moody backdrop and Newton becomes a newer, British version of Hepburn, the speed of the film moves too erratic in moments where it isn't needed, and the musical score is over-used when it's not that great of a score to begin with. And as it moves along, it becomes tricky and hokey, and not for it's own good. Worth to see to compare to the original, and then it can be discarted. B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've got no love for remakes and don't care who knows it. Sure, there are a number of truly great remakes such as Bogey's The Maltese Falcon (anyone who doesn't know that's the third version of the Hammett novel needs to check it out) and Scorsese's current The Departed.However, as the kids say, most remakes suck and this one sure beats the cake in that department.It's too bad because Thandie Newton is really developing into a great actress and Mark Wahlberg sure is on the upswing, but this atrocity sure as heck doesn't do either of them justice. Putting those two in roles created by Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant is just plain pitiful The biggest deal is the lack of humor. That alone makes this close to unwatchable. It soon becomes a chore to keep watching. The supporting actors sure don't match George Kennedy, James Coburn, and Walter Matthau.Ah, why go on, because older reviews here say it all. This is one hell of a misbegotten mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Stone's Charade was a wonderfully constructed plot, both in the movie and in the book. It flowed nicely, kept surprising you and was just lots of fun. If you want to remake a movie, why change all the plot twists and surprises that made it fun to begin with? Why change character motivations.I'm not as bothered by the casting as a lot of other people. The original had an amazing cast, this one I think has a decent cast. If they'd had a solid script I think it would have been a perfectly acceptable little movie.I like the very pretty and winning Thandie Newton, and if you don't compare Wahlberg with Cary Grant he's really just fine in the role. I also do like the interesting obsession the movie has with faces, just because it's weird.In fact, for the first half, when nothing diverges too much from the original, it's perfectly decent. The problem is the script, which is muddled and confusing where the original was absorbing and exciting. Demme has made some good movies, but he has generally worked from other people's screenplays and I think the problem is he wanted to write his own and he sucks at it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The MTV Version of Charade?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with many of the comments I've read here. I was attracted to the movie by the name of Jonathan Demme, a director I have usually admired. However, serious miscasting of nearly everyone here except Thandie Newton (who is the best thing about this film), along with the weakening of the elements of terror, confusion, and outright menace make this a lame tale psychologically.Very annoying is the way in which the constant background music overwhelms the characters, the mood, and the dialogue. The visual style is extremely choppy, amounting to a visual assault which will please only those viewers whose brains have been permanently accustomed to video game, chase scene flick, and MTV frenetics. This approach succeeds in removing almost all of the romantic charm with which Stanley Donen imbues Paris in the original movie, Charade.Thandie Newton, on the other hand, a name and face unknown to me beforehand, is just perfect for this character, and seems entirely capable of stepping into Audrey Hepburn's shoes. She just needs an equally elegant and noble partner, and a better plot and visual style.The plot changes alter the characters so that the bad guys are not nearly frightening enough. So, although much of the original plot is there, most of the elements that make it a real thriller are gone.In all, everyone in our family found it weak and terribly disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not sterling, but interesting, remake of Charade (1963).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me get off my chest -- the absurdity of the 13% votes that are "1" for this movie. Maybe 4,5,6, or 7 ... but those who voted "1" are not to be taken seriously. The movie is an updated re-make of 'Charade' (1963), and you can't replace Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. In fact, Mark Wahlberg was a poor choice for the Grant role. Nic Cage might have been perfect. Regardless, the beginning and the end are quite different from the original, but the core story is the same. Having seen 'Charade', I knew what to expect, but it still was fun seeing the actors create the roles. Much of it was done 'tongue in cheek', especially Tim Robbins' role as the mysterious agent. Overall an interesting 100 minutes, if for no other reason than to see a more modern take on the original. I've always liked Thandie Newton since I saw her (along with Nicole Kidman) in the Australian movie 'Flirting.' Right now she is on a TV series, but she is a better actress than that. In this movie, one scene where she is hurrying into a hotel on a rainy day, as she turns to go in, the inside camera shot shows her slipping down, rebounding quickly, and getting on with the scene. The director commentary on the DVD confirmed what I figured, the slip was accidental by Thandie stayed in character. '</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of the fun and charming "Charade" but this effort is neither fun nor charming. Did anyone really think they were going to capture the magic of the original? Story is about a woman in France named Regina Lambert (Thandie Newton) who is told that her husband was murdered on a train and police Commandant Dominique (Christine Boisson) tells her that her husband has 6 million dollars worth of treasures hidden somewhere and that others will be looking for it. Regina meets Joshua Peters (Mark Wahlberg) who befriends her and starts taking care of her. Then Regina meets a man named Lewis Bartholomew (Tim Robbins) who tells her that he is a Government Agent and he shows her pictures of people who he says will be coming after her. When she is out walking down the street she does notice the same people following her but she insists that she doesn't know anything about the treasure.*****SPOILER ALERT*****This film was directed by the talented Jonathan Demme and he was obviously a fan of the original film. Since making "Philadelphia" Demme really hasn't done much as a director but he has been staying busy as a Producer. The main reason that this film fails is pretty evident, the casting. Wahlberg and Newton are both fine actors but putting them together just isn't going to create sparks like Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. This film tries so hard to be romantic and when its evident early on that there isn't much chemistry between them then it becomes painful to watch. This film even brings out the great Charles Aznavour to sing to the camera to remind everyone that this is suppose to be romantic. If the chemistry wasn't bad enough then the script will convince you that your watching a contrived mess. Once all the identity swapping started I wanted to wave a white flag and surrender. How many times did a character tell Regina that they were not who they said they were? How many times did Wahlberg himself say it? At least three and the makers of this film still expect you to care about this person. The best moment in the film comes during the closing credits when Robbins is locked up in a cell like Hannibal Lecter and a woman comes to feed him poisonous food. To bad it didn't occur in the opening credits!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Truth is that this film is actually pretty good (SPOILERS POSSIBLE)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be fair to say that Hollywood remakes are generally a tricky prospect, be it an 'Americanization' of a foreign film or an update of a beloved 'classic', the problem is that these films are generally characterized as soulless cash-ins, created by greedy Hollywood big-wigs in the hope of increasing the annual dividends. These films are usually slaughtered by critics, rejected by the public and left to wallow in obscurity. So now we come to 'The truth about Charlie' a remake of the Hepburn/Grant classic 'Charade', which judging by Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic and the IMDB score (a rather underwhelming 4.8) has been tossed by the critics and public alike, on the ever increasing pile of Hollywood's misconceived projects. It's a pity really because I actually enjoyed 'The Truth about Charlie' (although I must confess I haven't seen the original version; 'Charade', as I may have been a little harsher if I had) and felt the reaction it received was not completely justified, as there are numerous reasons to recommend this film.The film begins with Regina Lambert (Thandie Newton) returning home to her apartment in Paris, only to find the place ransacked and her husband nowhere to be found, however she is soon informed by the police that he has been murdered. It's not long before an entourage of mysterious characters appears who are quick to inform Regina that her husband had a past, had managed to make away with $6 million and that they're very keen to get they're hands on the loot and are perfectly willing to go to extreme lengths to do so. It's not all bad for Regina, as she manages to find some comfort (and more) with handsome stranger Joshua Peters (Mark Wahlberg), although an American agent named Louis Bartholomew (Tim Robbins) warns her to be wary of Joshua as his motives may well be duplicitous. Of course it soon becomes very difficult for Regina to know who she can trust, as she is soon being cornered by a trio of disgruntled thugs, by Joshua Peters, by Louis Bartholomew and by the French Authorities all of whom seem to believe she has knowledge of the money's whereabouts.And the plot twists just keep on coming, some obvious, some surprising and none superfluous. A film like this needs a strong, likeable, believable protagonist who holds your attention throughout the film. 'The truth about Charlie' is lucky in that it has Thandie Newton to carry the lead role, as she has managed to draw favorable comparisons with Hepburn's performance in the original, having not seen 'Charade' I can't comment on that, although she does posses something of a likeness to Hepburn and has her own brand of infectious charm, achieved largely through her ability to convincingly balance vulnerability and strength in a character. Newton is perfect for the role and the film would not be nearly so good without her and one can only hope she will soon join the Hollywood A-list as she has more than enough talent to deserve to do so. The same cannot be said for her (more famous) co-star; Mark Wahlberg. He comes across as bland and unlikable; there's something strangely obnoxious about him and the script gives little opportunity for character development, while Wahlberg demonstrates his limited acting range and lack of chemistry with Newton. The rest of the cast give solid performances in their mostly one-dimensional roles, Tim Robbins being the stand-out. The film does have a few plot hole (without wishing to give too much away one character sacrifices their life to save Regina, even though they perhaps would be more inclined to kill her than rescue her) and the ending is contrived and mawkish, clearly they wanted to tie all the loose threads together and also hoped to increase the films commercial potential. Acclaimed director Jonathon Demme captures the atmosphere of the sleazy side of Paris perfectly, and the soundtrack, which is comprised mostly of French Pop, also adds flavour to the film (and is remarkably similar to the soundtrack used in Neil Jordan's 'The Good Thief').Whilst those who adored 'Charade' are liable to loathe this film, I'd recommend that anyone interested in stylish thrillers were little is what it seems (and almost all the characters have at least two names) check this film out. My score 7 out of 10</fullReview>

The cinematography, the cast, the direction, even the dialogue (some of which was "based" on the original movie's dialogue). --The constant closeup camera angles of the actors (and I use the term loosely), were sickening--literally. --The acting was stilted and uneven. The girl from the Welches Grape Juice commercial is 50 times that actress that Ms. Newton is in this movie. Sure, Ms. Newton is pretty to look at, but none of these actors should feel proud of the acting jobs they've done on this movie. I only hope they get better with practice and a better script. --The plot was disjointed and messy. Even with the original to base the remake on, they managed to fail. --The dialogue was just sad. They tried to make some of the parts sound like the original, but it just didn't fit with what they were trying, and failing, to do with all the other wry dialogue.Even if I had not seen and loved the original, I still wouldn't like this movie. But, hey, give it a whirl. It will give you an excellent frame of reference for every other bad movie you will ever see. You can say with complete confidence, "Well, at least this movie wasn't as bad as The Truth About Charlie." Oh, and keep your finger hovering over that fast forward button, you'll need it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but with a few short-comings.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is very good. Thandie Newton does a terrific job! She is absolutely beautiful, and is very very funny. She does a wonderful job as the lead character. She plays Regina Lambert a little more independent than Audrey Hepburn did. Newton really pulls the movie along, especially when considering Mark Wahlberg's performance. This is an incident of poor casting. Wahlberg tries to play the character too seriously when compared to the performances of the rest of the cast. He does not pull of the "fool" aspect of his character either. Now, to get back to the positives, Tim Robbins is very entertaining. His seens' are quite amusing and captivating. Christine Boisson portrays a very strong character with an incredibly strong performance. I cannot say that I am familiar with her work, but I think it safe to say I might enjoy it as well.The Truth About Charlie is a good movie. Compared with Charade, I would say that "Charlie" is one poor casting and a few holes in the screenplay from being as good as Charade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was some kind of inside joke, right!? The previews actually looked somewhat interesting, but I cannot believe that I sat through the entire film. What's worse is I can't believe Tim Robbins agreed to be in it!!!It was pathetic! One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Most home videos have better acting and more interesting dialogue than this movie.I can't believe people found as many positive comments about this movie as they have. One guy posted it as a B- in his comment below. No way anyone could give it any better than a C-. It was a complete waste of time.So don't see it, don't rent it, and for god's sake don't even consider buying it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The truth about The Truth About Charlie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another story about a bunch of people after a bunch of money, "The Truth About Charlie" has ample talent on both sides of the lens and offers a solid cast, good art, good technicals, and good locations. However, in its attempt to become a circuitous tale of intrigue the film loses credibility and turns awkward, clumsy, and almost comic at times as protag Newton is constantly accosted by heavies who seem more annoying than foreboding, more an inconvenience than a threat. Nonetheless, many will find this slick flick classy and busy enough to be able to overlook its foibles, Demme's apparent lack of vision, and the silly showdown at the end. Recommended for Newton and Wahlberg fans and needy sofa spuds. (B-)Note - The DVD I rented from Netflix.com was a double feature with the original "Charade" on one side and "The Truth..." on the other.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Truth About Charlie" is an imaginative film that avoids traditional Hollywood filmmaking. If you are looking for the original version, "Charade," I would suggest renting it. "The Truth About Charlie" is it's own film. After all, what is the point of a remake if it's just a replica? In it's own right this interpretation is clever and funny. The dance scene alone makes the film worth watching. Director, Jonathan Demme, has created a world of chaos and confusion filled with fascinating characters and framed by the charming city of Paris. Like the protagonist, Regina (Thandie Newton), the audience doesn't know whom to trust, which makes it unavoidable to sympathize with her. There are several great actors featured including Joong-Hoon Park, Lisa Gay Hamilton, Ted Levine, and Christine Boisson. Thandie Newton is wonderful and, if you find Mark Wahlberg's performance to be insincere, think about the story itself and how that might add to the plot. This film is certainly not a no-brainer. Demme is a remarkably talented director who works well with actors and makes strong choices. "The Truth About Charlie" is another example of why he is one of the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Badly over-directed movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poor direction, overdone performances (with the exception of Christine Boisson as the Police Commandant) and a multitude of plot holes make Truth About Charley a movie to avoid. Director Jonathan Demme spends the entire movie calling attention to himself. No scene is shot straight on. Every camera cliche learned in "director's school" is employed to distraction. Demme's attempt to dazzle us with continual use of a hand-held camera merely makes us dizzy. Truth About Charley is loosely based on the Cary Grant Audrey Hepburn thriller, Charade. Do yourself a favor - watch the original on TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this opening night because I am a fan of the 1963 film "Charade". I in no way expected "The Truth About Charlie" to be as good, but I expected it to at least be tolerable. Alas, it sucked.The camera angles were everywhere and unstable, enough to make a motion-sick person seriously ill. They changed parts of the plot for the worse. You felt no compassion for any of the characters, and frankly couldn't care less what happened by the end.You do have to give Tim Robbins credit for his amazing resemblance to Walter Matthau. But then the credit has to be taken away for having participated in the making of this movie.Why Jonathan Demme decided to butcher a film that had so much potential is beyond me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is wrong with you people??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an enjoyable action thriller. It's not a classic like Charade, but it's a fun movie in its own right. I think the biggest problem people had is that Demme had the AUDACITY to cast an actor who's COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from Cary Grant as the male lead. No, this movie isn't Charade, and it doesn't need to be; we've already got Charade. If you want to see Grant and Hepburn, then WATCH CHARADE, OK?If you want to see a fun variation on Charade, with talented young actors and the director's own tributes to the French New Wave that was contemporary with the original movie, watch this. And, since it's a Jonathan Demme movie, it also features great performances and great music. If you can't get past the fact that this is a DIFFERENT MOVIE from Charade, with DIFFERENT ACTORS and a DIFFERENT STYLE, then don't waste your time watching it, and don't waste our time by coming here to moan about it. Just go watch Charade, and leave this movie for those of us who can appreciate Charade as an inspiration rather than a sacred text.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The truth about this movie, is that it could have been alot better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The truth about this movie, is that it sets up a lot of promise but ultimately falls flat on its face. I watched this film not having any expectations and not having watched the original Charade.The Film starts of quick leaving us with the main protagonist Regina (Thandie Newton) who finds out her Husband was Murdered. Suddenly Regina Finds herself surrounded by a group of strangers who are suddenly interested in her well being. She Finds out that her husband was involved in this money scandal and the money's whereabouts is currently unknown. Which explain the group of people circling her like Sharks? Will Regina be able to find the money in time to save herself from this mess or will she get lost in the streets of Paris?One of the movies biggest shortfalls is the lack of character development, Regina finds herself involved in this mess but barley interacts with the people who are involved with her. Which might explain the weak cast on board for this movie. Thandie Newton didn't have any Major projects after M.I 2, especially movies which she headlined , her history was mostly as a supporting character but too her credit I found her the only standout performance in this film, she practically saves the film from ruin and keep us interested for the most part of this film. Unfortunately the rest of the cast are all miscast Mark Wahlberg is dreadful his chemistry with Thandie is absolutely non existent which makes the love aspect of this film a flop. He tries too hard to fit into this role, the result is he looks so unnatural and fake in almost all of his scenes. Tim Robbins who is a very respectful actor, does what he can with what they've given him but its not enough. The rest of the people on board have very little screen time and are a colorful mixture of characters but like Robbins not enough screen time and character development.Now to the finer Aspects of this movie, is that its very beautiful, Paris is shown in all its glory and color. The scenes are all nicely crafted and shot, Thandie Newton and Paris make the scenes utterly riveting and delightful to watch. The Music is unbelievable ( Id recommend the sound track) very Sexy, sizzling mixture of French, Moroccan and Spanish music. You wont find a better blend of scenery and music that fit as good as the ones in this movie.In conclusion the film is interesting and different, it starts of quickly throwing us on the streets of Paris, intrigue us with Regina and her mystery but in the end it lets us down by wrapping up too quickly and leaving too many loose ends. Worth a watch for all suspense and mystery Fans, the movie has its good points namely Thandie Newton and Paris. A must Buy for all Thandie Newton Fans who deserves to have a lot more films under belt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not Charade, but has it's own merits.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If your expecting Charade just re-shot and re-cast you'll get the unexpected. I guess the producers new better. The original is a classic with an exceptional cast. So this movie must be judged on its own. Some scenes are very familiar, but many of my personal favorites are not anywhere to be found in this new version, and the although the 3 main parts are cast well (there not Hepburn, Grant and Matthau, but they do a serviceable job), but there really isn't a stand out supporting cast (like Coburn, and Kennedy). I'll admit some scenes, dialogue, and plot points are similar, but so much of it isn't that it stands on it's own as much as it relies on the original. The main thing this version lacked was the fun mild sort of comedy that the original possessed. It's too bad it has to be compared to the original but remakes always are. This movie was entertaining, had intrigue and was worth seeing on its own, I do recommend it. But when compared to the original you realize that they did it right the first time. Check it out but try to leave the comparisons behind or you could be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Charade" gets a French New Wave make-over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jonathan Demme is smart enough to know that he can't create a remake of "Charade" that would stand up to the original, and that isn't what he is trying to do. Instead, he takes the bare bones storyline from "Charade," then he shakes it and stirs it with a large dose of French New Wave style and silliness. What you end up with is a zany, off-balance, lightweight, fun little film that nobody who regularly goes to see Mark Wahlberg films is going to like.Films of the French New Wave often exposed the falseness of the film medium to the audience in a playful way - and Demme does that here again and again with camera tricks, silly dialogue and, of course, Charles Aznavour (from Truffaut's New Wave classic, "Shoot the Piano Player") even gets caught crooning the film's romantic soundtrack from the hotel balcony as the film's stars play the love scene! Other clues to Demme's sylistic intentions are found in his casting of French New Wave leading lady, Anna Karina - as well as New Wave director Agnes Varda - in small roles in the film.I haven't actually seen "Shoot the Piano Player," but I know it's about a piano player who accidently becomes mixed up with gangsters, so I'd bet that a more favorable comparison could be made between "The Truth About Charlie" and that film than between "Charlie" and "Charade." It's true that both Mark Wahlberg and Tim Robbins are uncharacteristically dim here, but who cares. The film does not ask to be taken very seriously. I would recommend "The Truth About Charlie" to those who enjoy movies from the French New Wave and who are interested in watching a silly romp.</fullReview>

My devotion to Audrey Hepburn is the reason why I put this movie off for so long. I caved a couple of nights ago and found myself watching a throughly entertaining movie. I realized whilst watching the film that I was not watching for a 'Charade' remake but a whole new movie altogether. I understand that the remake thing is getting old now, but that's how all art is formed. Think of the novel; think of how many novel have been modeled and copied Don Quixote, and they were often good novels as well. So I think instead of viewing remakes as simply that; a remake. We should be watching it as an entirely new film that hasn't been made yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Truth About Charlie vs Charade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What everyone really needs to realize is that The Truth About Charlie WAS a remake of Charade. As all remakes, they are basing the movie on the original. So one has every right to compare The Truth About Charlie to Charade. And, when it comes down to it, The Truth About Charlie just falls flat.I did have the pleasure (and handicap) of watching Charade before the remake. Both were watched in my "Literature in the Media" class, and we were required to write a comparison, with no bias from the teacher at all. And guess what? The entire class wrote how better composed the original was, and how the new movie was corny in and of its own. And even all of the students who missed the viewing of Charade still thought it stunk.Watching the remake was hilarious throughout the beginning because of how it was just so corny. And then after all of the bad acting hilarity, we were met with a very convoluted climax. But it was short lived, and after Dyle's death wail and fancy gun skills were released, the movie got right back to being funny with the random singing and teleporting guy singing at the end. Would be a great comedy if that was what they were aiming for. (Which, by the way, they were not.)Some things that bothered me the most were:-The character of Reggie: In the remake, they completely changed the persona of Reggie. In Charade, Reggie was clueless but intelligent, naughty but not horny. Only similarity the new Reggie had was that she was also clueless. Though Thandie Newton is OK looking and an OK actor, I wouldn't be able to tell through this movie.-The unruliness of Marky Mark: In the old movie, Peter Joshua (or was it Joshua Peters?) was cool. He was mysterious and you couldn't tell whether he was good or bad up until the end of the movie. In The Truth, right from the get go you know that Cary Grant is good, you just don't know what he's up to. It made the movie predictable and kind of flat.-Political Correctness: Wow, what the heck? Crazy how, that in France, an group of ex-soldiers that are Asian, African-American, and (crazy) Caucasian work with an African-British lady (who is helping out a (creepy) Caucasian secret agent) and her (wanna be cool) Caucasian friend/lover find out about Charlie, a Swiss, and his money. And don't forget about the help of the French police. Wow, am I watching Barney? Realism, say "by by."-Boob lady in the beginning: I am a dude, and I enjoy the occasional flash, it's true. But it seems that the writers knew that this movie was going to be less than great, so they just threw in a nice, uh, "pair" in the beginning of the movie just to keep those type of viewers hoping for more, and this random nudity made me more critical of the movie. I can truthfully tell you, a few people in my class were complaining about the lack of nudity they expected because of the beginning flash-age. And, I hope to God, that the lady in the beginning is not the same lady who "helps" the Asian guy at the end, because if it was, I don't know what I'll do.-Music: Arabian Gangster Rap? Is that even a Genre?-The addition of the "crazy lady mother": It seemed like the writers for the remake needed some deus ex machina character to solve random loop holes so they threw her in, and by her I mean Charlie's mother (who is crazy enough to be just some random lady who thinks she's his mother). Can anyone say random? She is not introduced or explained very well and pops up randomly. The kicker is she kills a lady, and yet is allowed to serve (and somehow poison) food at the uni-sex prison she was apparently sent to/works at. And, talking about her and the poison, what the heck was that ending? What kind of poison makes you violently wail before dying? And why the heck, after the whole happy song ending, did they add the lady poisoning Dyle (who mind you wasn't really that bad of a guy)? If you liked this movie, it's probably because you didn't watch it past the credits, because that part killed the entire movie. I mean they freeze frame on her freakin' smiling face. C'mon!Favorite part of movie: (Reggie throws *6 million dollar* stamps into fire)PJ or JP: (Speaking like a little girl) "Reggie! I can't believe you did that!Dyle: I can! (laughs)me: (in disgust) Oh-my-Lord...PS: If you liked the movie, you liked it because it was funny, right?</fullReview>

The action scenes are done very well. Wahlberg and Newton had good charisma together and they both looked really different. Tim Robbins was good as well. The chase and action scenes were really neat. Jonathan Demme directing is great. The film is very different and being that it takes place in France this makes the film unique. Give this movie a chance because its a very different film and the cast are in some good roles.

		<fullReview>Not really a remake of CHARADE but a homage of French cinema of the 1960s, THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE is a remarkably wonky thing that has to be seen to be believe. It's very difficult for me to believe that producers and folks at the studio didn't see that something was not quite right when they saw bits and pieces of this during production. I mean, the whole thing is totally kooky. I hate to say disaster or a mess because I believe the end product is exactly what the director wanted. So the only thing I can say though: does it work? No, it doesn't work. I'm not a big fan of CHARADE (too cute for my taste) so I don't feel like this "remake" is akin to blasphemy but I have to say that this is one of the weirdest studio films I've seen in many, many years. Things aren't made better with the fact that the film was mostly (if not entirely) shot on HD video, which doesn't look good at all. Looks like a series of home movies of famous actors with too much time on their hands than an actual film.One is only left asking: what were they thinking?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boiled the style and glamor out of Charade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I count three times that Mark Wahlberg has taken parts that were originally done by stars from old Hollywood. He was the astronaut taking Charlton Heston's role in the remake of Planet Of The Apes. He played John Wayne's role in the urban remake of The Sons Of Katie Elder, Four Sons. Finally in this film, Wahlberg tries out playing the many named man that Cary Grant played in Charade. As in Charade, do we ever know The Truth About Charlie.Three different icons with three different personalities. Well at least he didn't try to imitate Cary Grant in The Truth About Charlie. Mark was his own man here and frankly he's the best thing about this film. Thandie Newton never seemed as vulnerable as Audrey Hepburn in the original. And Tim Robbins was absolutely colorless as the fake CIA man, not a patch on Walter Matthau.But the biggest error was the elimination of those colorful conspirators George Kennedy, James Coburn, and Ned Glass from the original. Those guys added so much to Charade.Not to mention the style and glamor that Stanley Donen brought to Charade has been boiled right out of this film. Jonathan Demme who got such acclaim for Silence Of The Lambs was the man at the helm. None of these people qualify as a Hannibal the Cannibal type villain. I think he forgot what picture he was on.Fans of the original will be sadly disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Valiant Effort: An Ultimate Failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite my usual loathing of remakes, sequels, prequels and the like, I tried very hard to like this film. I am a fan of a lot of Mark Wahlberg's work and wanted to see how they would give a modern treatment of a very typically 60s film. And there were a few things (a very few things) they got right.First of all, I will applaud the creative team for pushing this film into a different direction than the first. A verbatim retelling is not worth the effort. This film is a lot grittier, a lot more "realistic" than the Grant-Hepburn story. Gone are the campy references and glossy colors. But here it still falters, trying to retain some of the humor and almost naive romance in a vastly different world where such things just don't seem appropriate.I also appreciate the background they gave on Regina, explaining how she could possibly have married a man she knew nothing about. I admit it had always bugged me. But they took it a step too far in trying to give all the secondary characters too much dimensionality. When they tried to force sympathy down our throats, it just became very confusing. I still cannot figure out what in the world was going on with the Lola character or why Regina cared so much about a person who was constantly posing a threat to her.I was most disappointed in the sacrifice of suspense and plot twists for the sake of action. While I applaud trying to make something new, there was no reason to fiddle with the guaranteed seat-gripping plot. Somehow the focus shifted from a stunning who-dunnit to a deflated undercover cop film you could see coming a mile ahead. I would like to have the opinion of someone who has not seen the original on this film to see if this can stand on its own feet. But then again, I would hate to deprive them of the excitement of unraveling the mystery of Charade for the first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Demme Does Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jonathan Demme does Alfred Hitchcock. And for this viewer's part, many of the viewers' commentaries are harsh -- I've seen a heck of a lot worse. Comparatives are inevitable, but I think it's important to watch this film independently, if you can, as opposed to constantly holding it up against "Charade." Initially there are dizzying camera angles and hand-held scenes that are distracting from the initial action. Also, while I think Christine Boisson was plausibly fine in her role as the tenacious commandant, her obvious and prominent plastic surgery was extremely distracting, too. I found all the performances enjoyable and the film, while flawed, entertaining. The scenery and locations are great and there really is genuine chemistry between Thandie Newton and Mark Wahlberg. It's nearly impossible to remake a beloved classic and it's hard not to impose your own "what ifs" (like what if casting featured Julianne Moore and George Clooney instead?). But for what it is, this is a worthy, frothy good weekend watch.</fullReview>

The same goes for whoever's playing Regina Lampert (I can't think of her name). On the same not, Tim Robbins is not Walter Matthau. The original one is so hard to beat that I most likely will not see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A nausea inducing shakey camera is not "artistic". If used sparingly it can be a nice effect but in every other scene you might just waste the 6 bucks you spent on the popcorn. Story was a bit weak on screen. Walberg is good but I no longer will see a film of his based on trust that he'll pick good roles. The best thing about the this movie must be the incredibly beautiful Thandie Newton. She's a fantastic actor and even if she was not I would pay full price just to look at her... but she is good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie keeps you guessing all the way to the end, which is its only audience-holding quality. The characters' roles in one scene are incongruent with the next ... imagine nearly being killed, yet a few moments later being calm enough to fall in love. Thandie Newton's character is guilty of the all-too-familiar cliche of transitioning from naive to suddenly savvy ... just in the nick of time, of course. It has a somewhat interesting soundtrack, but jerky camera work. Whatever happened to movies that were made for the enjoyment of the general public instead of directors trying to impress their peers?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is so, so. Mark Wahlberg is not charming enough for this role. I love him don't get me wrong, it's just that no woman would be so gullible to someone with no charm: He's no Cary Grant. Oh, and add to that the fact that we see him un-shirted for but a brief second. If he were a woman with such a fabulous body he would have been naked in several scenes!! :(The pacing is slow also. The director/editor could have picked it up a notch. But the real reason to see this film is Paris! It's beautiful, and if you have been there it will bring back so many memories. If you're planning on going to Paris see this movie first for a sneak peak. It's a truly magical city.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mystery full of twists and turns. Keeps you wondering till the end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several things in this movie did not work. First off, I think Demme was trying to hang on to elements of the original movie while making it modern. What we get is very awkward dialogue that was almost painful to listen to.Secondly, there were elements that were haphazardly put in that makes the viewer wonder why they were put in. For example, the strange woman in the black veil appeared twice and that whole bit with Charles Azanvour just didn't fit and was corny. This might be a tribute to the original, but why put it in if most people aren't going to get it?Finally, the acting was just bad. Newton was horrible, all those bad guys were just caracitures, all over the top not to mention campy.The only redeemable quality this film had was the plot, which was the only thing that made you want to stay in your seat and watch how it all panned out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My biggest complaint about this movie isn't the acting, it isn't the direction, it's not the predictable script, it's that the Director of Photography was drunk or something for the first half of the movie. The shots are all out of focus, even on the stars, the film is milky and washed out, and the shakey hand held effect is WAY old and it's hard to follow. It can be cool for a scene or two, but for 3/4 of the movie? Come on guys, that's just lazy. This entire movie seemed rushed to me. "Hey we forgot the tripod and the HMI's" "That's ok, we'll stop it up a few and do it handheld."And Demme's trade mark (for me at least) is the 'actors staring straight into the camera' shot. Looked good (and was VERY effective in Silence of the Lambs), but way overused in this movie.And what's up with shooting your B-roll on HD? The mismatch in looks threw me WAY off. Mix and match like that is cool, but I don't think they did it correctly, it wasn't consistant. I don't mind the video look of High Def, but when it's inter-cut w/ 35mm footage, it's distracting and nausiating.All in all, this movie HAD potential, but that was thrown out the window when they hired the DP.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May be a Spoiler. So I checked this movie out with a girlfriend and my sister and me and my sister weren't interested. But my girlfriend thought it was. She loved seeing Thandie Newton in a starring role, and well its nice seeing versitility. And damn was it nice seeing Marky Mark period. Take your shirt off anytime Mark. So yeah we checked it out and had mixed reviews. Audiences complained about the offbeat camera angles and flashbacks and the tone of the film and that it was a poor imitation of "Charades". Well I wouldn't know, I never saw the first one and from the story line I don't think I'd be interested. Everything appeared too rushed and too twisted to be a convincing plot. And when I say rushed I mean the scenes weren't developed enough. Then the singing in the middle of the "love moment" between Thandie and Mark and the ending combined to be a joke on all of us. I think some of the audience would agree. I ask the question too. Was this movie supposed to be a comedy, romantic comedy, serious drama, not so serious drama. I didn't feel it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grittier Paris haunted by the elegance of the original in this classy remake: not quite a comeback by Jonathan Demme ? more of a tease.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's appropriate that I saw `The Truth About Charlie' on Halloween night because it's haunted: haunted by the memory of director Jonathan Demme's charming, brilliant films of fifteen and twenty years ago; haunted by visions of Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, replaced here by Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton; haunted by the shadow of the nostalgic, gray Paris of Doisneau and Brassai and the French Nouvelle Vague, evoked here while Demme shows us instead the newer, brighter multi-ethnic Paris celebrated in William Klein's book, `Parigi + Klein'; and haunted above all by the glittering afterglow of `Charade,' the 1963 film of which `The Truth About Charlie' is a remake. And finally, this movie, for its director anyway, is haunted by the shade of Demme's late filmmaking nephew Ted, to whose memory `Charlie' is partly dedicated. It's a bit of a Halloween mystery why Demme did this story at this particular time.Thandie Newton, Audrey Hepburn's replacement, is charming. Mark Wahlberg is charming too: here at last he's in a context that's quite elegant, and his perpetual desire to please becomes not sleazy or pathetic but appealing and warm. (He's surprisingly suave, and he looks nice in his hats, but he's not as real as he was in `Boogie Nights' and `The Yards,' his best roles to date, or as alive as in `Three Kings,' which made his desire to ingratiate more central and exploited his physicality more successfully.) Tak Fujimoto, Demme's longtime cinematographer, is back making Paris gleam and sparkle. There's a lot of nervous energy happening in the background again, as in Demme's earlier films, this time lots of cameos and allusions, and even several appearances, singing, right now, gray but still eloquent, by the great Charles Aznavour. Instead of the canned movie music Henry Mancini produced in 1963, there is a glittering and rich World Beat score. What more could you want? Well, as it turns out, quite a lot. Demme has not really come back to life, because this is a remake, however free, and the updates and additions have muddled the charm of the original, as the World Beat sometimes overwhelms the dialogue. It's as if Stanley Donen's film were grafted onto `The Bourne Identity,' but without the momentum of Liman's new movie, or the edge of Matt Damon's performance in it (Wahlberg is like a goofier Matt Damon). The Frenchness here is a bit more authentic than Stanley Donen's --- but just a bit. Tim Robbins is more subtle and menacing than Walter Matthiau. Really, the mise-en-scene is unbelievably rich even if we don't know where a lot of the scenes actually are, so they lose some of their effect. This is certainly a glossy spy-crime-identity thriller with a real romance running through it, as I guess `Charade' was. There's a heck of a lot of originality and skill gone to waste here, but it just doesn't hang together as well as the original did, and the ending is a muddle. Somehow the action doesn't make a lot of sense much of the time and the movie seems like a collage, which is another Halloween mystery, because Demme has always been a master of clear exposition even of the most convoluted plots.I don't know where exactly Demme has been of late years. `Silence of the Lambs' made him famous and `Philadelphia' established him as the most politically correct of mainstream directors, but those two movies broke the momentum of wit and originality that he had established with the crazy, complex `Melvin and Howard,' the exhilarating `Something Wild,' and the hilarious and charming `Married to the Mob': `Silence of the Lambs' may have been riveting and well made, but it was a disappointment for fans because it turned its back on the earlier work. Then Demme got involved in minor projects, a filming of Toni Morrison's `Beloved,' another music documentary, this time about Neil Young, and so on. `Melvin and Howard,' `Something Wild' and `Married to the Mob' weren't remakes. They had an edge of originality that came from the grafting of Demme's hip sensibility onto his down-and-dirty experience as writer and second unit director for Roger Corman and other B-picture makers. `Silence of the Lambs' was a turn away from the whimsicality and freshness that had marked his previous films, but it was remarkably well done; it was in `Philadelphia' that Demme began to flounder. The AIDS theme, anchored safely by the star performances of Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, may have seemed courageous for a mainstream film, but Demme before that had always given mainstream a fresh and audacious twist, and here there is no humor or quirkiness any more. `Philadelphia' has only one truly memorable, quintessentially gay scene ? the one where the dying Hanks dances to an aria sung by Maria Callas while attached to his IV trolley. The rest, however respectable, is only conventional exposition and without gay credibility. The director got bogged down in political correctness, and it seemed likely that he was not going to make cinematic art any more for a while, if ever.This new movie is a return ? in part, anyway -- to the lighthearted spirit of Demme's great period, but it seems manneristic and a bit empty, since, at the heart of it, it's not his own original work but a safe facsimile of something really much better. This is a tease. Demme could come back to us ? I still hope -- if he wanted to. He hasn't lost it. He's just gone astray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The credits for this movie say that it is based on Stanley Donan's Charade, starring Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant. I suppose it is, but this movie inhabits a completely different world. There was something of a mystery to Charade, but its most memorable parts were the clever dialogues between Hepburn and Grant and the romantic tension. This movie has no clever dialogue, and very little romantic tension. There is no chemistry at all between the two leads. Wahlberg's character has no charm, and therefore elicits little interest from the audience.And the shots of a beautiful, romantic Paris have been replaced with shots of a modern, grungy Paris.We're left with a story about a disagreeable set of characters moving through an unattractive series of settings. The business about the stamps, which had included a wonderful cameo for the stamp dealer in Charade, flies by with almost no interest here.I forced myself to watch it to the end, but I don't see why you should bother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Redundant and erratic remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Truth About Charlie" is a completely unnecessary remake of the classic "Charade" (1963). While the thrilling espionage and deception plot of the original has been largely carried over, the few adjustments that were made to the story are implausible and arbitrary, and most of its favorite and memorable moments were omitted. The locations around France do create a charming atmosphere every now and then, but the actors keep the presentation even from reaching an average level. Although in the actors' defense, I have to say that anyone would have a hard time making such ridiculous dialog come across realistically. The interesting and fascinating character of Peter Joshua (portrayed in the original by Cary Grant) was watered down to a completely flat and dull figure that will bore you to death, and what Mark Wahlberg does with it is more helpless impersonation than it is acting. One of the other few strong points that I noticed was the soundtrack, which fits the mood nicely, incorporating tracks by artists such as De-Phazz, Asian Dub Foundation, and Gotan Project.Looking at it as just another movie, it receives a personal rating of 2 out of 10 points. But considering that this travesty calls itself a remake of "Charade" really tempts me to rate it even lower. However, it is not fair to relate a film to other works, so based on its own strengths and weaknesses, it has earned the second point. I was surprised to see such a weak production coming from Jonathan Lemme, who gave us titles like "The Silence of the Lambs" and "Philadelphia".I watched "The Truth About Charlie" because I'm a big fan of the original, and I was wondering what they did with the material. Now that I have seen it I can tell you that, should you feel the same urge, you can safely ignore it and just re-watch "Charade", which has not lost any of its charm in the last 40 years. The remake might in some way make you appreciate it even more, but it is not worth the two hours of your life that it will cost you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surreal re-make of a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original, 1963's "Charade", is one of my all-time favorite movies. I can not begin to describe how much I love it's charming mix of genuine thrills and dead-pan comedy. This successful combination, complete with a classic finale makes it quite possibly the greatest movie Hitchcock never - but very well could have - made.Then there is the re-make, directed by Jonathan Demme who forever will sail on the success of another classic: "The Silence of the Lambs". The original story begs to be re-made, with all it's original plot twists and turns, but this is not really the way to do it. I have nothing against Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton, I am one of those who actually thinks Wahlberg can act, but come on: they are no match for Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. It's like comparing a bag of stale, sliced bread to a luncheon prepared by Jamie Oliver. If it were up to me I would really go the whole nine yards and cast some super-mega-stars that would make the screen jolt with charisma (example: George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Mel Gibson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Denzel Washington, Rene Zellweger, etc). Peter Stone's original screenplay deserves it.But then again, had these stars been involved this new script probably would have never seen the light of day. At least not with a director who hasn't had a serious hit in ten years (hopefully he will fare better with his re-make of "The Manchurian Candidate"). Don't get me wrong, "The Truth About Charlie" was at times entertaining but never really exciting, but that could be because I knew the general plot from countless viewings of "Charade". On the casting side however French actress Christine Boisson is a great breath of fresh air as the police detective. You are delighted whenever she appears on-screen, giving the scene some spark.But the major fault with this re-make - I think - is how it's quirky charm and even surreal feel to it, only start to come through the last 30 minutes. We are genuinely taken by surprise from a scene during the end credits that is so weird (and funny) that you suddenly realize the whole movie is not meant to be taken seriously. I listened to director Demme's audio commentary and he points out how the entire movie is supposed to let everyone know they're just pulling your leg. So why the heck are most of the scenes underlining this fact in the "Deleted scenes"-section of the DVD!? In stead the result is an ok movie, at times incoherent, with an abrupt turn into surrealism the last half hour that makes the experience more odd than fun!The soundtrack does deserve mention, as it is brilliant with it's flavor from every corner of the world. It suits the movie very well and I am aching to order it of the net as soon as my next paycheck comes in!Ok, but over the whole disappointing re-make of one of the greatest comedy/thrillers of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Two Cents (which I would not even pay to see this film again)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard that Jonathan Demme was remaking `Charade,' I thought How Interesting. I saw no need to remake Stanley Donen's masterpiece but thought that Demme might be able to do something interesting with it, especially with Thandie Newton in the Audrey Hepburn role. Now, having finally seen it, Demme's good intentions are evident. However, where Donen's original is the defining film of the comedy/thriller genre, `The Truth About Charlie' is a mess, neither funny nor thrilling. The only thing that keeps you watching after the first forty-five minutes is Newton, who deserves stardom, and an interesting performance by Mark Wahlberg in the Cary Grant role. `Charlie' starts out promising enough. I found Demme's direction innovative but missed the humorous banter and chemistry between Grant and Hepburn. I almost thought for a moment the `Charlie's detractors might be slightly off-base in their condemnation of it. Then the whole thing derails, not suddenly, but painfully slowly, until there's no point to any of it. The more it becomes, or tries to become, a thriller, the more I cherished the original for being a great thriller but actually BEING a comedy. Luckily, the DVD's side B contains a fully restored, beautiful version of `Charade.' I am certain that this is relief was provided unintentionally. My guess is that the DVD producer thought that providing this ol' dated classic on the same DVD might be a hoot for modern audiences to watch, given how `hip' and `visionary' Demme's remake is. Well they couldn't be more wrong. Anyone who watches `Charade' after this turkey is going to wonder, as I did, why Demme even bothered.For starters, `Charade' is such a joy because it is a comedy. It never takes itself all that seriously. The story is complex, challenging and rewarding, but easy to follow. `Charlie' attempts humor but is clearly not a comedy. This story as anything but a comedy should not have been attempted. Demme gets caught up in the stylishness of Paris, seeming so fascinated with his own imagery, trying to ?modernize' the original story, that he leaves the `Charade' story buried (it is there somewhere). It's unbelievable to me that an accomplished director like Jon Demme doesn't seem to get `Charade' at all. Demme uses the basic story and some lines from the original, lines which drop dead as they leave the actors' mouths. Like Hepburn's `quitter' line that becomes a book-ended theme in `Charlie' is completely misused. Hepburn is clearly busting Grant's balls in the opening of `Charade,' so when he walks away and she calls him a quitter, it's actually a great line. When Newton uses it on Wahlberg, they've barely spoken a word to each other. The line is all homage, a jarring reminder that you're watching a vastly inferior film. The 1963 film was visually innovative as well, which probably helped make it a huge hit. It's one brilliant scene after another, with the ski lodge opening, the funeral (the funniest ever filmed. `If Charles had died in his bed, we wouldn't even have HIM,' Hepburn says of the French police inspector), Hepburn trying to play spy, following the suspicious Grant, right up to the theater finale. `Charade' is unrelentingly entertaining. `Charlie' sees itself as a modern interpretation of the same story-in theory, how the same script would have been shot today. The fact that `Charade' never needed to be remade is almost beside the point. A remake should at least be able to stand on its own merits. `The Truth About Charlie' has not even that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of a movie-classic, Oscar-winning director, acclaimed actors in Mark Wahlberg, Thandie Newton and Tim Robbins and one would expect at the very minimum, a decent movie. On the contrary, The Truth About Charlie not only borders on being boring, the acting was horrendous and Jonathan Demme directed like an amateur filming a vacation video.The Truth About Charlie is about Regina Lampert (Thandie Newton), who came back from vacation to discover her Paris apartment ransacked and cleaned out and to be notified by the police that her husband, Charlie, was murdered. She was then pursued by three former Special-Ops, who believed Charlie has stolen what was rightfully theirs. Tim Robbins, acting as a government agent and Mark Wahlberg, a presumably "innocent" samaritan came to Regina's help but are these two really who they said they were?The movie is not worth your time nor effort. Do yourself a favor and watch Charade instead. Although released back in 1963, Audrey Hepburn, Cary Grant and Walter Matthau were so much more believable in their roles as Regina Lampert, Joshua Peter and Bartholomew.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another film to add to the on-going list of "Worst Films of 2002" list. I saw "The Truth About Charlie" at an advance screening and all I have to say is "Thank God I didn't waste my $8.00"! I was 100% dissapointed, I waited almost a full year to see the re-make being a huge fan of the 1963 romantic thriller film "Charade". But when I finally got to see it I just wanted to curl up and sleep. "The Truth About CHarlie" started off exciting, but about an 1/2 an hour into the film it just go's really slow moving, predectiable and just boring with a huge capital "B". Director Jonathan Demme didn't know what tone or mood he wanted in this film, and by being this consfused he added to many plot elements and silly ideas into a story that was simply a romantic thriller. The best scene in the film is the Tango scene, the worst part of the film was the very long drawn out ending and the worst character was Charle's own mother showing up to add more confusion to an already old idea and a story that was zooming out of control. "The Truth About Charlie" was the 3rd attempt at re-making this classic story but the 3rd time is not always a charmed one! "The Truth About Charlie" is poorly directed, poorly acted and poorly mis-casted. The problams with "The Truth About Charlie" is for one it lacks the wit, the style and sopistication of the 1963 romantic thriller. Thandie Newton dosen't have the style (nor the right clothes) to fill the Hepburn role. Ms. Newton didn't seemed to be confused if she should paly the role funnty, stupid or cute. Mr. Walberg just seemed too wooden to be a romantic lead, and as well he lacked the sopistication for the lead role. The other problams was the plot was all over the place with an ending that was just dull and flat. "The Truth About Charlie" didn't know if was a coemdy, a thriller or even romantic. The film started off interesting enough with some great opening credits, but midway through the plot started getting boring and flat. Even if you seen the orginial James Mason film or the 1963 film; a re-make should still seem somewhat fresh and updated. I've heard in interviews that director Demme stated making "The Truth About Charlie" was complicated movie to find the right tone. Watching the film it shows that Demme wasn't the director to handle a film like "The Truth About Charlie" since Demme's tone was all over the place! This re-make was more stale and lifeless and again the ending was just silly and left me bored. I just can't see why Hollywood can't stop making re-makes of good classic Hollywo od films, and invest the money to clean up the orginials and re-lease them to the general public?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an enjoyable film with a delightful cast and a well organized plot. Though it is not oscar worthy, and does have up's and downs, it still is overall a well done film. What really makes the film are not the main characters, but the co-stars such as Tim Robbins and the mother of the slain Charlie. The setting is quite beautiful, with some parodies of Director Jonathan Demme's old classic's. One scene that was well organized is the tango scene. All the characters come together in this surrealistic nite club. The beat of the music and the speed of the dance really intensifies the fun within the film. Should you see this film, do not go expecting some heavy duty, mundane, oscar worthy material. Go with the attitude of a Friday nite movie, to relax, and just watch. Trust me, it is a nice getaway from everyday life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charade revisited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jonathan Demme's recent work "The truth about charlie" is called his "european love letter to american audiences". While the film itself is anything but lovely. Any remake, especially one that follows in the footsteps of a film like Charade, will of course have criticism from the audience about mis-guided expectations or subtile dissapointments. But in this case Demme's work has given us nothing more then hollow characters potrayed by the always attempting to be impressive Mark Walburg, and the not quite so modern Thandie Newton. The only saving grace of the film is by far Tak Fujimoto's very unexpected and captivating cinematography, which makes the audience pay more attention to the film due to the strange angles and effects then attempting to read into the story's mindless dribble. Basically, if you want a movie you don't have to think about, and just sit back and enjoy it's little quarky moments. I highly reccomend this film. However if you go to see it expecting another Demme masterpiece... your probably better off renting Silence of the Lambs or Philadelphia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poorly executed bad idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is absolutely nothing positive about this film, whatsoever. Nothing.The fact that it took four (!) screenwriters to pen this script (a remake!) should have been the first clue that this film should never have been committed to celluloid. The screenplay, the all-important foundation on which the film is built, makes no sense, nor does it contain any dialogue above that of a TV movie of the week. This could be redeemed by good performances; unfortunately, Thandie Newton proves that her cardboard acting in "M:I2" was not a one-time occurrence, and Marky Mark makes the audience yearn for the charisma and charm of Cary Grant, while failing to provide even a trace of it himself. There's also some bizarre self-referential moments that, while the filmmakers obviously found to be witty, have no place in this film and serve only to shatter any suspension of disbelief that the meager screenplay provided. There's even a moment over the end credits, in what appears to be a sloppily executed "tribute" to Francois Truffaut, that descends into the realm of the completely inexplicable.Outshining the inanity of all this, however, is Jonathan Demme's direction which, to me, has to rank up there in the "worst ever" category. The entire film is shot with a handheld camera (or so it appears), which, combined with the frequent staring into the camera of the characters makes this feel like a Parisian "Blair Witch". Other scenes with the shakiness and constant rotation of the camera had me reaching for the Gravol.This film should never have been made in the first place. It was, though, and, amazingly, the end result managed to be even worse than it should have been.Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

Romance,intrigue,comedy,beautiful Paris settings,complimented with a Henri Mancini music score. The remake has none of the above. Dreary Paris settings,music score,nothing to rave about,Thandie Newton is no Audrey Hepburn and Mark Wahlberg is no Cary Grant. This film is not a complete waste. A OK film to watch if nothing else is available. The DVD that Universal has released,here in Canada and the U.S.A. has both editions. In this way you can compare which film is the best. I am sure,most people will prefer the original,Charade. After around 40 years,the original Charade,still stands out. No doubt it will become a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flipping through channels recently I caught the last 45 min or so of this film, and remembered that at the time it was being previewed in the theaters I had wanted to see it and then forgotten about it when it came out. Confused and a little nauseous from all the close up shots of the actor's faces I looked it up online. It was on here I found out that it was a remake of the movie 'Charade' and according to one user an awful remake. So while in best buy adding to my film collection I took a chance and looked to see if they had it, assuming they wouldn't. But to my surprise they had one copy for six dollars and I bought it driving straight home to watch it(I've always been a fan of Carey Grants since I was a kid, and I'm only 21 so I think thats kinda random). Wow, this movie was amazing! It brought me back to watching TCM and AMC which I had taken a long break from. Growing up my best friend living next door to me had one of those moms you hope to be. Classic and elegant the woman (I've known her for 17 years now) has never had a single chip on her red manicured nails, always smelled of Chenal along with several of their lipsticks in her clutch at all times, and introduced me to the little black dress at the age of five. Miss Kitty(not a nickname) always has TCM on and when we went to Blockbuster we never took movies home like 'Honey I Shrunk the Kids' instead we would walk out with films like 'Pillow Talk,' or a Hepburn film, and for sleep overs a Hitchcock film. Charade can convert even today's generation into believers of 'classic' films they previously thought boring. I was able to talk my younger brother into watch it and he paid me $40 at the end b/c he had lost his bet predicting he wouldn't like it. Charade is witty, entertaining, romantic, suspenseful, and not at all predictable. The characters are great and Hepburn's classic wardrobe can still be found in Miss Kitty's closet. Now older, I can also say that all this talk about 'thin being in' a new thing in Hollywood is BS, Hepburn couldn't weigh more than a hundred lbs. Also, I'm not sure if I am the only one who feels this way, but when watching this film I think of George Clooney while watching Carey Grant. I don't know why this is, and I asked family members during Thanksgiving if they saw it too and they did as well, but they weren't sure why either. The actress who plays Hepburn's role as Reggie does have the same petite bone structure as Hepburn along with the ability to use emotion through her eyes, but can anybody really fill in her shoes? I like Mark Wahlberg, and having no interest in seeing the rest of this film I'm not sure who is to blame for such a mess, but really like everyone else has appeared to be saying on here, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blasphemously Bad Remake Insults Everything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jonathan Demme's THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE, as most know, is a remake of Stanley Donen's CHARADE, which was once called "the best Hitchcock movie not made by Hitchcock." Being a big fan of Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant, I was naturally outraged. This outrage only lasted for about the first 40 minutes of the film, however, only to replaced by confusion and disgust at this pathetic excuse for a movie.Newton plays a woman living in Paris who's husband is killed on a train. She finds out that her husband, Charlie, wasn't who she thought he was and that his former partners in crime are now after her to find his money. Mark Whalberg appears, romantic, dashing, whatever. He seems to want to help her, although he may be one of the bad guys. Tim Robbins shows up as a bumbling American agent of some kind who wants to help her but also requires Charlie's money. From there it gets a little shaky... make that really shaky. People die and the camera work degrades in quality. Anyone who saw the original will know what's happening... for the first hour... sort of.Mark Whalberg and Thandie Newton are definitely well below the stars of the original film. That said, they are the least of the things wrong with THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE. Jonathan Demme must have gone forth to make this with mischief on his mind because he thoroughly ruined this movie.From the start, the viewer can tell that the style changes completely between scenes in an attempt to be playful. Once Anna Karina (once Godard's wife) appears, we know that Demme is trying for a French New Wave thing. This might have been delightful if Demme knew what he was doing. The New Wave movies had ideas in mind and good performances, unlike this film. There is a scene where Newton mentions Trufaut's classic SHOOT THE PIANO PLAYER and its star, Charles Aznavour suddenly appears, singing that movie's theme song. Huh? Having seen and loved these French New Wave classics (which CHARADE was nothing like, by the way) I was insulted by these clumsy, name-drop references.The whole new wave thing must have been the filmmakers' excuse for ignoring plot, because after a while, it has completely derailed. Something comes up about Charlie's mother, also not very clear. Then come several flashbacks that suggest what happened with Charlie and his cohorts. These are filmed like bad re-enactments from TV documentaries. At one point one of the female heavies spontaneously declares her love for Newton. Nothing occurs before this gave any indication that love was to bloom. In the climax, Robbins is either hamming up his act or simply didn't care enough about the film to give it a real performance. By that time, though, the movie has completely given up on trying to thrill or excite, but now feebly tries to amuse (one actor gives the camera a good long look). The silliness continues through the credits, to the irritation of all. The viewer is left asking "What the hell was that?"THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE, more than anything else, is a mess. It's a slap in the face to CHARADE and a lame bastardization of the French New Wave. Demme's career had been in decline in the years after his success with SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (which is spoofed in this film). PHILADELPHIA and BELOVED were both weak, but they were classics when compared to the anti-masterpiece that is THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE. Anyone who enjoys good movies or at least thinks they do should avoid this film. It isn't worth the time. To see what this was supposed to be, but much better, rent CHARADE, PIERROT LE FOU, SHOOT THE PIANO PLAYER and other movies not starring former members of the Funky Bunch.The truth is that it sucks.</fullReview>

The story in "Charlie" is incredibly thin, there is zero suspense, the acting is poor, and the ADR is brutally obvious in places. I know people in film school who have produced, directed, and edited better movies than this. I kept waiting for something to happen to improve the film, but nothing ever did. From the first few moments, IT SUCKED!!! Don't waste your money. If you want to see Europe on film, get "Ronin", "Bourne Identity", or "Amelie".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many reviewers compare this movie to the original Charade, andunderstandably made scathing comments. As the movie is an unapologeticremake, I guess it is fair to be compared. Yet I am not a great admirer of the original, and I offer some contrarian viewpoint here.The plot is not from an Umberto Eco novel. You may watch this movie foreverything else but plot. Neither for much suspense. The stylistic variation the director chose may be called daring in certain quarters while it may be anhomage to the days gone by, nothing new. I enjoyed the multi-ethnicexuberance of Paris well captured in the odd camera angle and movements.The leading actress, whom I much admired from movies such as Jefferson inParis and Besieged, is well cast in my opinion. She has uncommon grace, andgives off whatever Audrey Hepburn might have for the audience of 60's. Shedoes not monopolize the screen, even though the whole movie is centeredaround her every inch of the way. To me, it feels like an intelligent acting and direction.There are several gestures, loud and clear, towards world-peace whichculminate in the final confrontation scene which gathers everyone with a gun in hand. Cheeky, yes, but still makes you smile a wistful smile in today's climate. Charles Aznavour's song from his earlier musical Lautrec is a fitting element and bolsters the romantic atmosphere, which is regrettably not as ample as we wish coming from the leading actor.It may be immature to expect villains in real life are as inept as they are in the movie, but yet I still wish.... Good musical soundtrack (to my ears circa 2002, sounds better than the HenryMancini-Ray Coniff!), and one of the great posters in recent years.</fullReview>

I liked the movie - it was well made, well acted and I saw scores of other higher rated action movies with much bigger logic holes or discontinuity goofs.The Paris staging is superb, and whoever watches the directors commented version will better understand the subtle hommage the author makes not only to the most beautiful city in the world, but also to the French cinema. (maybe not very popular today in the US?)Yes, the original - 'Charade' was a better movie, and Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn were screen monsters whose performances are hard to equal. However, 'Truth About Charlie' is a good film, and I cannot help but recommending it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These 2 movies were "BASED" on the same story. Separated by 4 decades, they were never meant to be the same identical movies. Why would you even want 2 movies to be identical? We already have "Charade"...now we have "The Truth About Charlie". I'm sorry, I personally get annoyed when people expect one movie to be the same as another. I watch movies as an escape from reality and entertainment. If you're looking for reality, then watch the news or documentaries or reality shows.This movie stands on its own. This is not an academy award winner, but then I'm sure it was not expected to be. There are some good action scenes, and I personally liked the way the characters fumbled with one another. They are from 2 different continents, cultures and backgrounds.Remember, this is not "Charade" and it does not star Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. If that's what you want to see, then by all means, watch "Charade", otherwise, quit expecting anything when you go watch a movie and just watch it for itself.Just so you have all the facts, I tend to rate movies high (from 7 to 10). I gave this one a 7 only because of the somewhat disconnected way it arrived at the ending. Thanks.MWR</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Eclectic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the movies that I have seen in the last few years, none have I enjoyed as much as this. The plot is threadbare, yet it works in the films favor. The acting is fantastic, especially a particularly delightful Thandie Newton, whom I had doubts about since her particularly one-sided performance in MI:2. Mark Wahlberg was his atypical self, detached, outside, yet deeply involved, and it fit his character well.The locations and extra casting are excellent, instead of portraying France as the place of ultimate beauty as is often seen, or a city plagued with an over-abundance of harlots, it is seen here as a place that is crowded and populated with very bizarre characters.The movie suffers from a sort of mordant wit, the end sequence being in and of itself worth watching the entire movie for. I recommend seeing this with someone who is not of the "popcorn movie" fan club, as they won't understand what was trying to be achieved.I'd give this 4 1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Truth about Charlie" is not a good movie. The IMDb rating of 4.8 accurately reflects its below-par quality. When a movie goes bad, it may go bad in all or many departments. This one has bad music, bad cinematography, bad acting, bad scripting and bad directing. The basic story is all right. It's been done before and done extremely well as "Charade" (1963). This remake is both pointless and bad.Do I need to point out specifically the ways in which each of these departments is done badly, or is it enough simply to offer a general assessment? Let's leave it at that because no doubt everyone involved is capable of better work and probably has gone on to do better work. Certainly both Wahlberg and Robbins have. Demme went on to remake "The Manchurian Candidate", which was not bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some films that just shouldn't be re-made. Ben-Hur springs to mind, along with Metropolis, and probably the best of Bogie (with or without Bacall). This was another.I *think* Demme was trying to give Charade a new "voice", but he fails almost immediately by showing us Charles Lampert's demise; when in the original it was the fact that we DON'T know what happened to him that adds to the whole bewilderment for Regina - not to mention the loony (though menacing) baddies, and the bizarre ways they were bumped off.It's also arguable that the original wasn't worth repeating anyway since, at best, it was beautifully done piece of fluff with 3 stars - Hepburn, Grant and Paris - doing what they were known for and did best. This version is much darker, and so misses out on the stylish, chocolate-box feel of the original. Even Paris manages to look dismal.All of which is a great pity because Thandie Newton is a good actress, and was probably at her most gorgeous at this time. And with a lighter touch, Mark Wahlberg might have been given the chance to be the proper leading man he shows glimpses of.Lastly: No kid - who was *pivotal* (if somewhat annoying) in the original. The whole market scene was completely wasted. And boy, did I miss Henry Mancini.So, all in all: A disappointment - even though I'd read a few of the comments before I watched it, so I wasn't expecting much.Unfortunately, they were right.</fullReview>

Harder call since Tim Robbins was the only ray of light I saw in this bad re-do of the 1963 "classic" Charade.Ok let us say Matthau by a nose! Sorry! Ok, now Audry Hepburn compar3ed to Thandia Newton? What is a Thandia Newton? Well, she is pretty but she can't act much and compared to Ms. Hepburn...it is impossible to compare.There is one winner in this one. Christine Boisson as Commandant Dominique. I mean she matches up against an eighty year old guy named Jacques Marin who played the Inspector Grand Pierre in the original. Now that is no contest. Ms. Boisson is very good in her role and is the true light, little as it seems, of this picture.You know director Jonathan Demme has done some great work. Silence of the Lambs (1991) being my favorite and then Philadelphia (1993) which was an award winner. But this is late 2002 and the cupboard has been a bit dry. Maybe that is why he stooped to doing this thing. He even hired the maniac from "Lambs" for this one. He was no James Colburn that is for sure. Perhaps he needed the work too. I like folks to get work and do pictures. I just wish they did better work.I mean someone puts up a lot of cash to do these things it would be nice for every once and awhile the product created was worth the cost. Ok I'll quit pontificating and get to it. This is a poor version of a moderately good picture from 1963. If you must go in the matinee so the cost is less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truth about a Remake that didn't know what it wanted to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What was the director Jonathan Demme thinking? The original "Charade" (with Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn) was ten-times more entertaining than this boring thriller wanna-be."Charade" itself was far from being a flawless movie, but at least it got several things right. The dialogue was funny with a good dose of wit, and, more importantly, it didn't give away plot twists before they occurred. The dialogue in "The Truth About Charlie" ("Truth" hereafter, for the brevity's sake) wasn't nearly as half as funny -- which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, if what the director wanted was something of a darker thriller. Unfortunately, "Truth" hardly has any surprising plot twists to qualify as a thriller either. Well, there ARE plot twists, but most are presented in such a predictable manner that no one is really caught off-guard. (My cousin, who had not watched "Charade" before, thought "Truth" was very predictable) It's a big shame that "Truth" horribly fails where "Charade" splendidly succeeded. Even the wonderful comedic twist at the end of "Charade" has completely disappeared in "Truth."My guess is that the director Jonathan Demme wanted to transform the comedic "Charade" into a darker thriller where the line between good and evil is not as clear-cut. Noble intention, I'd say. Unfortunately, I think Demme was working with a wrong material for what he wanted. At times, it even appeared that Demme himself was confused about whether he wanted a straight-forward light comedy or a more convoluted dark humor for the laughs. And the end result is a movie that doesn't really succeed at anything it sets out to do.My recommendation? Watch "Charade" to know all the fun and the plot twists. Then watch "Truth" to see how NOT to make a remake.(A note to Korean fans: Park Joong-Hoon gets a good deal of screen time, which is good. However, he is at his best with a more sly comedic stuff, and I feel that Demme's direction didn't really allow Park to shine in his mainstream American debut. If the movie was lighter in tone, like "Charade," I bet Park would have been captivating. What a shame.)</fullReview>

Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton did a fine job with the roles in which they were cast (Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn ARE hard acts to follow). No decent acting, however, could have survived the incredibly choppy editing and mixed media (35mm to video? did they run out of money half-way during filming?). The audience survived that, but several people gave up and walked out when it turned quasi-musical during the on-screen performance of Charles Aznavour. The worst indication was when the audience began laughing AT the movie, not with the plot.Save your money and rent "Charade".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Demme disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A major disappointment, given that one expects more than this kind of fluff piece from Demme. The acting by Wahlberg and Newton is at times embarrassingly flat and uninspired (Grant &amp; Hepburn they ain't--but even by their own lesser standards they're off ), and the way they move in and out of the French language (at times unable to express the simplest things, and then zinging a highly idiomatic phrase) makes no sense. And the plot....well, let me ask you: How much do we really care today if the US government loses 6 million dollars (a fraction of what we plan to spend on the war in Iraq on a daily basis)?I suppose there's the angle of whether Wahlberg and Newton will connect with one another in the end, but after sloshing through the banally entangled plot line, I'm sure your reaction too will be: Who cares? It seems the real motivation for Demme in making the film was to find an excuse for the cameos by Agnes Varda, Charles Aznavour (superb, as always, in his chansons), and Anna Karina (all that was missing was a cameo from her ex, Jean Luc), and a chance to have someone finance his stay in Paris (the beautiful visuals of the city are testimony to his love of it).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One For You, and One For The Cat !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you remake a classic then you're in deep trouble. However the solution is pretty easy; having something or some things that can compete with what that classic already has. In this case (The Truth About Charlie ? 2002) got nothing to stand up to (Charade ? 1962) except being based on it ! They dealt with the original exactly like this ; got the magic out of it, then added some blood. There is a straight-to-video feel all over it. The supposedly interesting scenes are shown totally uninteresting to a degree where I couldn't care less. The thrill is dead. Forget any funny moment because this one is dry as hell. I think nothing was really new except the acupuncture of Ted Levine's character. Mark Wahlberg was wrong, just wrong, to play this role. Yes he comes from crime movies to make the matters a little suspicious here and there but alas, he has no chemistry with Thandie Newton, and oh my god, I can't stand him in romantic moments! You will be extremely disappointed in Jonathan Demme who directed it and wrote the screenplay to it as well. He did zero to left an effect or a stamp, as if that was the plan from the start when he took on the mission of this remake, 2 years before taking on the mission of another remake; The Manchurian Candidate. WAW I think half of Hollywood production these days became remakes, pale ones too !This was undoubtedly a vacation for the actors in Paris. Watch Tim Robbins at the last scene standing in the cell, hardly curbing his laugh, while mimicking the posture of Hannibal Lecter in Jonathan Demme's previous ORIGINAL movie (The Silence of the Lambs ? 1991) to understand how the whole thing was close to an inside joke for them, fooling around for money, for kicks, but not for making a memorable work or at least an equal job to the first movie.3 stars out of 10 from me. One for Thandie Newton, she was the only cute and believable factor, doing her work fabulously, making watching this movie bearable; nevertheless with just one good work, this movie was faraway from enjoyable. Another star for the scene of blockading Robbins's character at the end; finally they tried to make something "different" there, despite a little elongation that tarnished it. And of course the third star goes to the cameo of Charles Aznavour singing (Quand Tu M'aimes) or (When You Love Me). Now this is the only moment of greatness in here, not because of the magical presence of my beloved Aznavour, but for the way he was portrayed as transparent image that becomes unequivocal for the lovers when they dances passionately. Plus, believe it or not, I dreamed of this moment, as it is, 15 years before seeing the movie, yet the singer was Frank Sinatra, not Aznavour! Yet, even this matter, his appearance, got spoiled since they made him clear for everyone at the second and last time he showed, in a way turned the magic into sort of silly joke !It's a waste of time and efforts but why not, let the wheel of industry move anyway. If you have seen the original then you'll have awfully predictable movie, boring and useless; simply you'll be mad. And if you didn't then here's a poor and highly tasteless twisty movie for you. What infuriates me badly is that they got the nerve to release it as DVD with the original one TOGETHER!?? Maybe it's a way to give you some chance to compare Hollywood of the 1960s with Hollywood of the 2000s (and it won't be for the sake of you know what !), or maybe it's a new commercial move to give one movie for you, and one for your cat (however I bet the cat won't be that amused !). No, surely it is a way to sell this movie anyhow by putting it with an assured sellable commodity, or a forever hit.P.S : this is my review number 700. I know that I found the love of movies in me long time ago. Hope that love, just love, finds me someday soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, there is absolutely no remaking the fantastically superb and extraordinary performance given by Audrey Hepburn and Carey Grant in the original "Charade". That's just a given. No one will ever be as good as Audrey and Carey, and these actors blatantly prove that sentiment.Mark Wahlburg seems to be getting himself into a lot of remake films lately, and I can't say it's a good thing for him. While his performance in "The Italian Job" was stellar (though I never saw the first one), he bombed "Charlie" badly. Like stink-bomb-in-the-locker bad.The camera work is absolutely atrocious as well - instead of keeping steady and actually USING a tripod at least every once in a while, the director seemed to have some inordinate fascination with the hand-held camera and the rapid-fire editing from extreme close ups of one characters face to a second characters face. The one scene where the gang of thieves and the main Female character (whoever plays her), are in the nightclub dancing (though I certainly wouldn't call that dancing - and the scene, I might add, was NOT in the original Charade), the constant spinning of the camera while the characters danced together made me feel like I was on the tilt-a-whirl at the carnival again - not my favorite ride.In a few short words, due to the camera work, the atrocious acting, and the absolutely terrible way the writers mangled the original script after the first 30 minutes of the movie made me want to stand up and leave halfway through, and I was on the verge of asking my fellow patrons if they had an airsickness bag I could purloin. My overall rating would be a 2 out of 10, and should never be remade again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Possible Spoilers May Follow, Or Not*I just got finished watching this movie on one of the cable movie channels I get. Oddly enough, it was actually next on my "To Rent" list at Blockbuster. All I can say is, I'm SO glad I didn't waste $4.60 on this piece of junk.Charade, the film on which this is based, is a witty, stylish, if a little cheesey, but ultimately thoroughly entertaining Mystery/Spy Thriller/Comedy. The Truth About Charlie gives us the same basic plot, the same basic characters, and most of the same basic events, but with one minor difference... they lack style.I don't think there are any modern-day actors with even half the style or class of Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. They make the admittedly convoluted plot-twists (just how many different name-changes DOES Cary Grant undergo?) seem perfectly all right, and add an element of humour that is distinctly missing from The Truth About Charlie (there are a few minor attempts at jokes, most notably a brief scene involving finger quotes, which I remember from the previews, but most of these attempts, especially that one, fall absolutely flat). Why anyone would even consider attempting a remake like this, which has no chance of ever doing justice to the original, nor attempt to distance it from the original even a bit in terms of plot, characters, etc. (e.g. The Italian Job, the strongest of Mark Wahlberg's string of remakes, which is really not saying much), is beyond me.NOTE: I'm writing this at nearly 1:00am, and as such, the above paragraph may seem a little convoluted and difficult to follow. Allow me to sum up: This film was doomed from the start.My biggest objection to the movie, though, is the end. There's not a moment in the climactic scene that's even remotely intense. I sat there waiting for something to happen... but nothing ever did. This film is listed as a thriller, but there's not one thrilling moment in the entire movie (other than the first 10 seconds or so after the opening credits. I rather got a thrill out of that.). And the final revelation, which, in Charade, I felt was one of the all-time greatest film endings, in The Truth About Charlie felt strained and not especially believable, having been ruined first by a total lack of evidence for it, making it seem like the writers just pulled it out of a hat, and second by its execution, done entirely in overly-melodramatic (to the point of being cliched) exposition.The saddest thing is that the one actor who really could have excelled in this movie (Tim Robbins, who is very nearly as good as Walter Matthau, who played the role originally), was completely one-dimensional, and even got a bit annoying after awhile.</fullReview>

It seemed like the movie tried to produce some dry humor at times, but it just didn't work. And Tim Robbins was terribly miscast.FINAL VERDICT: A dull mystery film.

		<fullReview>*Possible spoilers* It tries to update the 1963 classic "Charade" for the modern movie-goer (especially the jaded ones between 15 and 25 years-of-age). AND, IT FAILS MISERABLY! As many times as I've seen "Charade" on AMC, it's still way more suspenseful than this alleged remake. Zatapec the Asthmatic was a poor substitute for George Kennedy's Herman the Hook. The fight scene on the stairs could just as well have been done with a Caucasian actor. *I'm sure I wasn't the only viewer expecting some kind of martial arts duel between Joshua and Lee (a la Wahlberg's "the Bourne Identity"), only to be disappointed.* And, while Lola was definitely easier on the eyes than Ned Glass as Gideon, the only reason I can see for adding a female co-conspirator, at all, was to create some kind of "bisexual tension" between her and Reggie. Tension broken less than five minutes later by Mama Dulac's imitation of the Little Old Lady from Pasadena! Last, but not least: what was with the Lady in Black? Was Charlie a bigamist, on top of everything else? Oh, well! I'm just glad I got this movie on VHS, with a free coupon. As opposed to wasting six non-refundable bucks at the box office!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people attend a film to suspend reality for a few hours of their day. However, in order for a film to keep the audience's attention, some truths need to be maintained during the plot. This movie, however, throws how normal people would react in a situation out the window and creates it's own set of rules. The editing was nauseating - camera shaking and spinning around the characters during their dialog. I found it difficult to believe that Thandie Newton's character would be so entrusting after the demise of her husband to a stranger she met while on holiday. My question is, "Where are her friends? Has she no support base?" Mark Walberg did not come off as that suave of a man to gain her total trust so quickly. There were too many times that Ms. Newton portrayed Audrey Hepburn instead of the character Regina.Perhaps it's just me, but every time Ted Levine appeared on screen I waited for him to say "...it rubs the lotion on it's body..."This movie says to me that all women have to feign lesbianism in order to get what they want from another woman. The best part of the movie was the French actors. This movie would have been better as an independent flick with unknowns playing the leads. If you decide to see this movie, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE rent Charade afterwards to wash this dribble out of your mind. The most touching part of the movie is at the beginning when Jonathan Demme dedicates the film to his brother Ted.</fullReview>

If you're going to create suspense, change where the money is hidden! The lack of chemistry between the leads further sank the film--they're definitely not Grant and Hepburn. Finally, the director seemed to be trying to add excitement through camera motion.

		<fullReview>According to the Australian DVD packaging, this is a 'Jonathna Demme film'.For those of us who are fans of the original Charade, Universal did something clever: bundled the remake with the original. That gave me the principal reason to purchase the DVD (or is that DUD) of The Truth about Charlie.But this can backfire immensely, as I could compare new and old?concluding that the newer film is one of the worst I've seen from either Jonathan Demme or Jonathna Demme, the well-known typing error.I recall Demme saying he would focus on the background elements that were missing from Charade, so that we needn't compare apples with rotten apples. It's an appalling strategy, as the film loses all tension. Demme fails to build up any drama in this new foreground.It seemed to have lost logic along the way, too, ruining the fine original script.What is the deal with Charles's mother? If Charlie was American, how come Mom was French and a bag lady in the middle of Paris? If she didn't know that Charlie had married, how could she have recognized Regina?I can't comment fairly on the lead actors?my love of the original Charade would make it too unfair on Thandie Newton, Mark Wahlberg and Tim Robbins.The film has some merits that stand on their own: inventive cinematography, Rachel Portman's juicy score, the surrealism of putting Charles Aznavour in to the romance scenes between Newton and Wahlberg. The choice of going to Clignancourt for the market is quite suitable in modern Paris. The Pablo Ferro titles, including the master's own hand-lettering, give the film a unique flavour. It's not meant to be realistic?so there are the old Citron DSs and Peugeot 604s as taxicabs (I defy you to find one in central Paris) and, well, Wahlberg's hat. But the fake sign on the hotel faade shows that not every aspect of production design has been as expert.These aren't elements that could be directly compared to the original's, but they made an otherwise ghastly film bearable for nearly two hours.But if I am focusing on discrete elements, then it shows how poorly the new film stands up. The Truth about Charlie is a film that's less than the sum of its parts.This abysmal effort suggests that the typing error may have been intentional. I wouldn't want my name associated with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jonathan Demme's unfortunate updating of Stanley Donen's minor comedy-thriller `Charade' lacks the only thing the original had going for it, namely the obvious chemistry between leads Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant. `The Truth About Charlie' features a self-serious, one-dimensional Thandie Newton and a wooden Mark Wahlberg, showing no interest in either each other or in lightening up--Demme has apparently asked them to take the proceedings entirely too seriously and they're only too happy to oblige. Demme's obvious intention to deliver lighter fare after the somber `Beloved' and `Philadelphia' is in principle a good idea and this should have been a fun romp. But it's isn't and it's easy to see where Demme goes wrong: the unfortunate casting is perhaps the worst in several years and not even the international supporting cast (including Christine Boisson, Ted Levine, Joong-Hoon Park and a smug Tim Robbins) or the French New Wave cameos (Agnes Varda, Charles Aznavour and Anna Karina) can save it. It's a whimpering bore and a waste--coming from a director of Demme's stature, it's also a major disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This bewildering choice for a film re-defines the word "pointless." If you need to know, this is a movie so utterly unconfident in its own validity that the DVD actually includes a copy of the original film on which it was based on the reverse side. "The Truth About Charlie" is a re-make of the classic film "Charade," starring Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, and Walter Matthau. Our latter-day version features the Cary Grant part played by Mark Wahlberg (!) and the Walter Matthau part played by Tim Robbins, who for most of the film, perplexingly enough, does a laughably awful imitation of Matthau in the part of Carson Dial. Thandie Newton is passable as Mrs. Lambert (the Audrie Hepburn role); that is to say, she makes a better Audrey Hepburn than Mark Wahlberg makes a Cary Grant (go figure).And then, of course, there are the additional characters --- a pair of French detectives and Mr. Lambert's/Lake's mother. None of them make any sense or add anything of value to the film. The mother was seemingly added simply for the final scene of the movie --- which was only possible because of a rare and predictably inexplicable deviation from the original story.This movie is one of those rare disasters so mind-bogglingly unnecessary that it makes you really feel for the people who starved to death while the $40 million or so it took to produce this movie was being spent to film it. Hollywood, get a clue: the first two rules of re-makes are 1)never re-make a truly bad movie and 2)never re-make a classic! I'm deeply, deeply sorry I watched it at all</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Remake Charade Badly?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a very sad statement to the state of film when someone of Demme's reputation insists on remaking a classic of simple perfection like Charade so poorly. From his gimmicky camera moves to his pathetic attempt at casting, He seems to miss the point at every turn of the plot. The original is so pure, so charming, so classy, so severely elegant, that it is absurd to try and muck up the plot by adding unnecessary McGuffins and stupid backstories that are at best infuriating. The new version is more confusing than mysterious. Just because you can does not mean you should. Marky Mark,a pathetic replacement for Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn's replacement who should remain nameless forever, seem to point to Hollywood's inability to find any adult actors with character and a muture sensibility. Do we have any adults left or all our current actors cursed with a permanent adolescent mindset. All I can say to this movie is "Why Bother?" I bought this movie DVD used with Charade on the "B" side thinking it was a studio remaster by Universal. It stuck me as weird that the video store put the Charade side up until I saw this "Bomb". Also I find it hilarious that a Director would put the very movie that makes his own version of it look stupid on the other side of the disc.</fullReview>

This film was quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. The performances were shameful - Wahlberg appeared as if he was an illiterate actor who had had the lines read to him five minutes before the shoot, and was struggling to comprehend his own character. The score was clumsy and out of place. Tim Robbins had an extremely weak performance, a bad accent, and an incessant look of confusion as if he was wondering why he ever got onboard a project as ridiculous as this. The final race scene between Wahlberg and Park brought me nearly to tears of pity for the, in all probability, mentally disabled producers that allowed the film to ever see the light of day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We Rented The Truth About Charley on DVD. The flip side of the DVD is a clean bright copy of Charade, so you get two for the price of one.I liked the film, and would recommend it. The reviews were unnecessarily harsh. The Portman score was original and although not my kind of music, it worked very well for the film, and very nicely showcases Portman's versatility. The cast was fine, even Wahlberg who is not my favorite lead, is good in the film. Tim Robbins is just great as Bartholomew (with a wonderful "end"), and the other players seem well up to the task. To judge the film, one must simply set aside the original and concentrate on whether this film works or not. I think it works ok. Am sorry we didn't see it on the big screen, but the DVD isn't bad. Some terriffic shots of Paris in it, a bonus. Demme gives the flick some flair and the overall "look" is original enough, I'd say. The mini-documentary about the making of the film is entertaining and not too long. I also viewed about 25 mins of Charade to re-familiarize myself with the material, and though I had also recently seen the film on AMC this version was more pleasing, of course. The players in the original are mostly legends of course (both the black hats as well as the whites) and I suspect that the comparisons were maybe too intense, I dunno. There were enough storyline changes to keep it interesting, including a French actress (Christine Boisson) as the police Comandant instead of a male lead and Lisa Gay Hamilton as one of the villains. I was not sure at first about Thandie Newton in the lead role but this also was probably a good call. The insertion of Charles Aznavour as himself is rather clever and seems successful enough as a musical bridge of sorts. Others might disagree. There is so much junk out there in film-land these days, this flick was a pleasant surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a depressing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me get this straight; Dyle was betrayed by Charlie, wounded and left for death; in the process of trying to get his gold back, he accidentally caused the deaths of his loyal compatriots; he's still conscientious enough to surrender his gun, then got poisoned by Charlie's mothers. He's the only guy with pure motive in the movie! And he got treated so, so, badly by the filmmakers. How depressing.Of course, the two stars, Wahlberg and Newton, got all the juicy lines. It is unfortunate that they inevitably get compared to Grant and Hepburn, because Grant and Hepburn's performances are simply heavenly. According to IMDb, Jonathan Demme wanted to get Will Smith. Smith, perhaps, could've sold the part better than Wahlberg. Wahlberg is a good actor, but in this movie he came across more as a thug than a suave, debonair, gentleman- operative. Tim Robbins, IMHO, is the guy who should be getting all the acting accolades here. His former henchmen, Joong-Hoon Park, LisaGay Hamilton, and Ted Levine, seemed to be enjoying themselves in their role. But Tim Robbins gave a wonderful performance. Of course, that maybe because I think his character was treated shabbily. Or perhaps it's because Robbins gave such a sympathetic performance as Dyle. His character deserves better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>darker than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought this movie because I absolutely LOVED Charade, with two of my favorite actors- Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. And while this movie was pretty good, I didn't like some things. First, my likes: I love the European feel, with the music and the way it was filmed. It gives it an urbane, sophisticated look. Second, I thought Thandie Newton was well cast. She's no Audrey Hepburn for sure, but she has a fragile elegance that worked well as the confused Regina who is thrust into a web of deceit. The dislikes: Tim Robbin's accent is thick and sounds like a caricature of a New Yorker. He definitely should have dropped that. I also would have cast someone else as Joshua Peters/Alexander Dyle/ Lewis Bartholomew. Mark Wahlberg just does a lot of brow wrinkling, and is no where near the suave elegance of Cary Grant. Overall, not bad, but if you haven't seen the original, Charade, don't watch this... watch that one instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, buy the DVD, but see below for why.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would buy the dvd, not because this movie is good. Charade, the original movie, is remastered on this DVD.The reason this film is such a failure: Cary Grant lies about his identity several times, but is liked well enough to forgive him repeatedly. This movie has Mark Wahlberg, who would forgive him. more likely kill him or have him arrested.Audrey Hepburn is classy, and smart. Thandie Newton seemed like the perfect murder victim, I was shocked she wasn't dead 5 minutes in. Everyone wanted her dead, and she left herself wide open to danger. They wouldn't have worried about her hidding anything well. So, why not kill her. No one likes to see a stupid idiot heroine running around a picture. Audrey Hepburn said she thought women made the best spies. She didn't meet Thandie Newton.Walter Matthau was a much better bad guy. He was funny too. Tim Robbins is just dark. Matthau seemed normal and not demented at first, so she trusted him. Why would she follow advice from a manic depressent.?Above why in a nutshell to see Charade instead of "Truth about Charlie".The Truth about Charlie is it is he is ugly and she wouldn't have married him to begin with. Therefore no movie. And she wouldn't think that Mark Wahlberg is cute enough to tempt the fate of marrying again, with how good she is at picking husbands. Especially after she finds out how much he lied, she should have started running after giving him the money or sent it by FedEX.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, the story in this movie as believable as the truth about Charlie. None of the characters in the film were remotely convincing, which made the film less enjoyable. What really hit the spot was the filming of the film. Can someone please take away the HandiCam from Pierre Morel? The camera was unbelievably wobbly that would make The Blair Witch Project a filming classic. After 30 minutes into the movie, I felt sick to my stomach. This movie deserved to be filmed straight for rentals, and quite honestly I wouldn't recommend this movie for any rental.If you like HandiCam flicks, this one would be right up your alley. My thoughts is that is deserves no more that 4/10.</fullReview>

The dialogue is corny and forced, the acting is terrible with the only exception being Robbins, who is decent. The story is uninteresting and has too many stupid subplots. The supposed villians are not in the least bit menacing or intimidating, and the ending is contrived, cliched, and anti-climatic. Not worth your money or your time. I kept hoping it would just hurry and end. What happened to the director of The Silence of the Lambs? 4/10. Just watch the original: Charade. It's marathons better.</fullReview>

I went to my local video store and rented it, came home watched it, and at the end I was watching a whole other movie. Some of the movie had very little refernces to the first one.

Cary andAudrey would surely turn over in their graves if they saw what ahash was made out of one of the classiest films of all times. Thescenes of PARIS (missing here), that haunting boat ride on theSeine with Notre Dame and that music in the background, MissAudrey in those Givenchy outfits being courted by Cary Grant ..needI say more!!The entire cast was a little better than a high school production ofteenage amateurs, none of whom, by the way, could even act theirway out of a paper bag. Who are these people and where did theycome from?It was definitely a disgrace to the memory of one of Hollywood'sfinest films. How could anyone have the audacity to think that theycould remake this movie ....if they were that determined, maybethey could have gotten some real actors who had talent.As we used to say in New York, before you watch this, check yourbrains at the door!!Better yet, don;t even bother it is a pure waste of time!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what can you say, I'm a fan of Charade and this is a disgrace. When the dailies poured in from this one, someone up top should have put the lid on and cut their loses. Granted, the filmmakers did attempt to convey the essence of the original film (not that they are bound by that) and did explore some slightly innovative editing and story telling techniques. However, none of those worked. The cinematography was abhorent...worse than shooting on a DVCam and editing it on a Mac... truly wasteful. Robbins was the only redeeming trait of the film, deftly capturing the essence of Barthalamew and mimicking the subtle vocal tone of the original character. MANY, MANY of the other lines of this script were so trite and forced by the other actors in entirety, were so insincere, that I often wondered if there was a director on set and, if so, if he shot the characters individually green screened so they couldn't even interact with eachother. It was like they were all in seperate rooms and couldn't react to one another. A horrible waste of time and one that was grueling to trudge through, like the muddy script and visuals accompanying it. Was there anything good about it? It ended.</fullReview>

Thandie Newton is a gifted actress, but in this she comes across at the dumbest woman alive. Not that she is the only character that is completely unbelievable-- in fact, every character seems to think that they are in some other kind of movie, with some other plot. Oh, my husband was just murdered and people are chasing me, but i think that i'll dance a tango with strangers and try to do the nasty with some guy that just happens to "show up" at the most convenient times. Completely awful film. I didn't even pay to see it, and i want my money back.</fullReview>

It's supposed to be about twist after twist, but it's so fantastical that you'd have to be a mindless idiot to believe this stuff that she's fed by Tim Robbins and Mark Wahlberg. Surely I can find something to say: it totally removed any suspense from the picture by having the guy that's singing on the record in the next room.

This movie was well directed and the screen play worked beautifully accommodated by great acting. I don't know why critics have rated this film as low as they have, perhaps they are arrogantly snubbing it due to it's status as a remake. Don't compare this movie to Charade, it's an entirely new set of acting talent that pulls it off well and set of course in modern times, the movie stands alone as if Charade never existed. Go see this movie, rent it, but it, find it on TV, it's been frequently broadcast on USA. I give it two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake of the 1963 Hepburn, Grant Classic - without the Class</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing one notices about this movie is that it has the look and feel of a really long music video. With dizzying camera cuts, motions and angles, the movie does more to confuse the audience than to portray a story.The next thing one notices is the this movie, with it's two dimensional characters lacks the Class of the Hepburn and Grant version from 1963.There is very little to get involved with when it comes to these characters who go through the motions of a who is doing what to whom, when, where, and why. And Thandie Newton gives nothing for the audience to sympathize with in her relationship with either Mark Wahlberg or Tim Robbins. In the end you are left just hoping to get it over with.I will add that if you close your eyes during the film, you'll note that Tim Robbins has managed to sound just like Walter Matthau from the original. I consider that the only highlight.My advice, Rent the original Charade from 1963. You'll have a more enjoyable evening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen Charade but it has to be better than this movie. Right from the start you can see that Demme is trying very hard to use a variety of cinema tricks like quick cuts and flashing images to create a cool film. But the truth is the story is difficult to follow and does not make a lot of sense. There are a couple of twist but not by way of plot development but rather by simply throwing in tangent ideas. None of the actors really seem to excite or capture your interest. The story is full of loose ends and unresolved plot lines. Seems like a lot of emphasis is placed on hip movie making instead of good story telling.The movie is worth watching from the standpoint of taking in someone's creative work. But that is it. This movie gets lost by trying to carry an incoherent story line wrapped in film tricks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thandie Newton is one of Hollywood's most underrated actresses, I suppose, because she has not yet found her niche as Jessica Lange did with Frances and as Nicole Kidman recently did with, whatever it is she has come to touch. Thandie shines always and ever. As for the rest, the script was a poor, untalented rehash of what was and is a classic, but then look at how many times Jonathan Demme's screenplay needed to be redone. Mark Wahlberg gives his most cardboard performance to date. And while the direction provides Thandie candy throughout, the characters all lack depth and real motivation. Where the DVD has value is in its flip side with the film, Charade, the untouchable original, and with its unmatched performances by Audrey Hepburn, Cary Grant, Walter Matteau, James Coburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass. The Truth About Charlie is that no one is made to care.</fullReview>

Jonathan Demme's limp mistake to remake the Audrey Hepburn/Cary Grant romantic thriller Charade lies mostly in his casting of Newton (easy on the eyes, but her acting is genuinely forced here) and Wahlberg (the obvious `He's no Cary Grant' aside he sleepwalks through in a blandly developed antihero too) who can't ignite enough of a spark to rekindle an old chestnut of internationale intrigue, murder and duplicity. A dull thriller is the worst kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Remake Charade Badly?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a very sad statement to the state of film when someone of Demme's reputation insists on remaking a classic of simple perfection like Charade so poorly. From his gimmicky camera moves to his pathetic attempt at casting, He seems to miss the point at every turn of the plot. The original is so pure, so charming, so classy, so severely elegant, that it is absurd to try and muck up the plot by adding unnecessary McGuffins and stupid backstories that are at best infuriating. The new version is more confusing than mysterious. Just because you can does not mean you should. Marky Mark,a pathetic replacement for Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn's replacement who should remain nameless forever, seem to point to Hollywood's inability to find any adult actors with character and a mature sensibility. Do we have any adults left or all our current actors cursed with a permanent adolescent mindset. All I can say to this movie is "Why Bother?" I bought this movie DVD used with Charade on the "B" side thinking it was a studio remaster by Universal. It stuck me as weird that the video store put the Charade side up until I saw this "Bomb". Also I find it hilarious that a Director would put the very movie that makes his own version of it look stupid on the other side of the disc.</fullReview>

He is no Cary Grant, actually in fact I don't believe he is a very good actor. I was not impressed with him either in another movie remake, that being The "Italian Job". As for Thandie Newton, well she is no Audrey Hepburn. But then again who is? She could have posted in her performance in this movie. Can she act? On what I saw in this movie I can only come to the conclusion she can't."Charade" had a certain charm about it. It was funny, mysterious and romantic. It was a great movie. Sadly, "The Truth about Charlie" had none of the elements that made "Charade" such a good movie and a classic at that.Unlike "Charade" which I have watched numerous times I won't be watching "The Truth about Charlie" again. It really is a bad movie.</fullReview>
