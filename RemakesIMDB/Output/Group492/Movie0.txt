		<shortDescription>I have to see this movie again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking at the Emmy nominations for 2005 and saw The Wool Cap and the name Gigot. I had to look it up to see if it was the same story - because although I haven't seen this movie since I was probably 10 or even younger, it remains one of my favorite films.I am moved to tears at the memory of this film. Jackie Gleason as the gentle giant Gigot - one of the best performances I've ever seen. His relationship with the little girl is lush and expressive without words. He loves her so much your heart aches watching it.Someone wrote "You HAVE to see this movie!" Agreed. And I HAVE to see it again.That I can remember this film from so long ago is a testament to its emotional punch. It's a sweet and touching film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heartwarming Gleason tribute to Chaplin and The Kid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This precious movie, Gigot, was made by Jackie Gleason as a tribute to his love for Charles Chaplin and his classic silent film The Kid (1921). Gleason's character Gigot is poor, basically a tramp, and mute, the muteness a plot device to emphasize that communication in film is all the more profound and emotional when the actor does not speak, but has to communicate to the audience through facial expressions and pantomime alone. Jackie Gleason would have been a WONDERFUL actor in the silent era. He is outstanding in Gigot. I'll bet Chaplin loved this film. Even the lovely French style music reminded me of similar music in Chaplin's silent classic City Lights (1931).Instead of a little boy (Jackie Coogan in the original), Gleason makes the little child a girl, one who is so traumatized by life and living with a prostitute mother that she rarely speaks either. These two souls don't need words to communicate their love for one another.One of the most powerful scenes in the film, almost painful to watch, is when Gigot takes little Nicole (the winsome Diane Gardner, whatever happened to her?) to a church. Of course she has been raised without faith, and Gigot yearns to teach the child about Christ's sacrifice on the cross, but he can't tell her in words. He starts hitting himself in frustration, but the love of the little girl rescues him from his torment. They'd never put a scene like that in a modern mainstream film in Hollywood today. Not politically correct.Just like with Chaplin films, there are mixtures of pathos and comedy. These juxtapositions are timeless and still effective, as long as the human heart remains sensitive to others besides itself.Often broadcast on the Fox Movie Channel, but unfortunately in pan and scan. This film needs a remastering and an official DVD release in its original widescreen.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely emotional.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first viewed this film I was only 8 years old. Even at such a young age I was completely moved. The surprising thing is that even now I remember those feelings. For the last few years I have been searching for this film on video, but unable to find it. Whenever I see a movie with Jackie Gleason in it I am always reminded of his character in Gigot, and how I long to see this character again. To some, the film may not have touched their souls, but to me I was totally drawn to this character. To this day I remember the part where Gigot tried to save the child; how much he cared and the risks he took because of his unselfish love. You don't see these kind of films today. It's a shame that inner emotions are no longer captured but over shadowed by destruction and the almighty dollar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackie Gleason may have been the greatest entertainer of all time. This movie shows that he wasn't all "booze, broads, cigarettes, and showgirls." When I first saw that this movie had Jackie in it, I thought it was a "vanity film" (sometimes stars take movies to satisfy large egos) but I sure was wrong. This is a wonderful movie full of heart and love. Only people with good souls could make a movie like this. I highly recommend this movie and once you see this movie you'll see that Jackie Gleason was a big man with a big heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A forgotten gem. Gleason's finest work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This splendid film is a lost masterpiece. Most everyone I talk to that has seen it, saw it on a local television matinée. So far as I can tell it is not available on video. This wonderful film has fallen between the cracks somehow but the discovery of it only adds to it's charm. Like a rare natural wonder hidden far off the beaten path some afternoon, you may be trudging through your day and stumble onto this film, a beautiful sentimental picture. If you like Capra, you will love Gigot. Not for the dark of heart or impatient, this film will move you to tears. It has the feel of a small foreign film, but has the heart as big as any film ever made. Directed by Gene Kelly, the set's are wonderful, the acting subtle and superb, the music perfect and most important of all "The Great One" Jackie Gleason's performance as the mute Gigot has a depth and pathos that few actors have ever achieved. I wonder if John Candy wasn't partially reflecting on 'Gigot' when he played his Del Griffeth character in 'Planes, Trains...' There is something behind these actors performances that could not have been acting. Like Buster Keaton, one gets the sense that deep down, the character is a reflection of the pain the actor truly feels. Check your local listings to see if this is playing and record it. A 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think that there's much to add that hasn't already been said. I first saw this movie when I was about 7 and never forgot it. I recently was lucky enough to see it again, nearly 35 years later and still marveled at it's emotional depth and breadth. I was amazed at how well I remembered details, especially the scene where he gets frusrated and begins to strike himself. It's amazing that he not only brilliantly played the character without dialogue, but he also wrote the movie and the music. How much talent can one person have?

It is a great performance by Gleason, and yes the little girl isn't the cutest, but she wasn't meant to be. It makes his love for her and the mother all the more powerful.

		<shortDescription>Gleason is wonderful, Katherine Kath an amazing child actress...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Affected, slightly overblown and mawkish, Gene Kelly's sentimental comedy "Gigot" manages to hit most of its funny/weepy targets due to a wordlessly wonderful leading performance by Jackie Gleason. Playing a mute caretaker in Paris, child-like Gleason befriends a prostitute and her young daughter (Katherine Kath, displaying lovely, solemn grace). Filmed in beautifully saturated colors, "Gigot" isn't immediately thought of as a natural fit for its star, and indeed many professional critics lambasted Gleason on the attempt alone, but The Great One is a marvel to watch. His sensitivity to this character seems quite heartfelt and, while director Kelly isn't really interested in subtleties, Gleason isn't the over-the-top comedian here; he's eager to please, but also gentle when it's called for, and--standing in the rain with the water running off his cherubic face--tender. If it's every comedian's dream to be taken seriously as a dramatic kingpin, Gleason is quietly pleased to be the acting prince. The movie doesn't come to much (it's just a doodle), but there are beautiful moments spread about which are immensely successful, and added up they make quite a pleasant, memorable vehicle. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never heard of this movie until I happened upon it today on cable. I was really surprised at how good it was. The movie is set in France, and it was filmed there so the scenery is very authentic. Most of the actors are French so are speaking English with a French accent which also makes the film seem more authentic. Good story line. Gleason plays a poor mute living in a basement flat. He takes in a prostitute and her adorable little girl. He's used and then rejected by the woman, but the little girl has fallen in love with him and sees him as her protector. Very unexpected ending.A very wholesome film, rated G, I'll be able to show it in class to my students. Jackie Gleason was truly one of the last great entertainers of our time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this movie on late night TV several years back and I found Gleason's performance totally captivating and quite influencing regarding my taste in motion pictures. The brilliance of Jakie Gleason's performance coupled with the mastery of Gene Kelly's direction makes this motion picture a must see for the serious film student; but, like most of Gene Kelly's directorial efforts the film does struggle about two thirds of the way through the story line. It is only through Gleason's performance that the viewer gets beyond the film's difficult moments. That being said, I loved this film and it does, indeed deserve the highest rating possible. This one is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackie seemed to have wanted to highlight this type of story, this type of backdrop, his choice of supporting actors/actresses, and his choice of music. He tried real hard on this movie. Ask Mr. Kelly, he will tell you.According to the history of the movie I have learned...he blew out the films' budget by totally rebuilding many of the streets of the small town it was filmed, by BUILDING the church, by using a 60plus piece orchestra rather than a smaller one (look at the Oscar nomination)...all to make the mood he felt was important to convey to the audience. It was not set in post WW2 France (more like post WW1)...but that was the mindset that he wanted us to envision. It was easy to get this in 1963.I feel the tones projected by each of the characters was of the appropriate intensity (look at the bistro scene, for example)...but it was up to each viewer to "buy it". Certainly the backdrops and the music score were convincing. As for the ending...what do we want? The lives for all of the characters had to go on (and without unusual fanfare) like real life. Want more of this stuff???? See Soldier in the Rain. "Ya know Maxwell, it's hard to be an overweight narcissist...."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when I was around 10 or 12 years old. I'm now in m 50's and still remember how this movie made me feel. You fall in love with Jackie Gleason at the start, you feel all of his emotions, without ever saying a word, and that was his specialty, and you're so happy at the end of the movie! It makes you laugh, smile, cry like a baby, even root for Gigot when he steals the money from the bakery! You only wish he would end up with a family. This movie should NEVER be re-made; leave it alone with all it's simplicity. That's what makes it such a classic. I just wish it would come out on TV or DVD. Or even on TCM or AMC, one of those channels that shows old movie classics. Heck, even Amazon!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The lessons we learn from the unloved and society's misfits...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gigot is yet another precious film that reminds us that the lessons we learn from the unloved and society's misfits are priceless. We fear for the gentle Gigot and we want to give him a voice so that he can express what he represses deep beneath his pleasant demeanor. We want him to love and be loved by the charming child, but we want to infuse him with a worldliness that will better arm him to deal with the selfish woman of the streets that can't deserve exposure to a heart like Gigot's......We know that he's destined for heartbreak, and that being mute will only sharpen the alienation that he will feel....Jackie Gleason's understanding of his character is more than solid; his interpretation of the lonely janitor is a revelation. The most gifted Comedians' comedy is fueled by a unique inner pain. This reservoir can be tapped for Drama as well, sometimes even more effectively. This is at first poignant, but at last an unforgettable film.</fullReview>

It's been that long since I last saw Gigot but it had to have touched on very deep and moving issues for 3 little girls to ball their eyes out. Looking back, the subject matter is a little adult (the streetwalker planning to run off with her lover &amp; take her little girl, thus leaving Gigot). I have yet to see it on video or even on late night. It is a wonderful, moving movie.</fullReview>

In the meantime, he takes in a prostitute and her young daughter and falls in love with the young child.Gleason's facial expressions as the mute are absolutely memorable. He creates a phenomenal character well worth remembering under the masterful direction of Gene Kelly.It is only when the crowd of Parisians think that he is dead that they begin to appreciate him. When he turns up alive, are they running after him as they're glad he is living or are they resorting to their never ending harassment once more.Poignant, and a treasure besides.</fullReview>

The director, Gene Kelly, tried to give the film a Charlie Chaplin-esque look, but ,in doing so, he made the film extremely sentimental. However, it has an airy, heart-warming innocence that the audience can feel strongly, and that with the film's wonderful music makes us feel just as sentimental as the movie. Gleason is surprisingly good, even without lines, and the little girl Gigot takes care of is adorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely a film to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a lot of "first reactions" to this movie. For example, and in no particular order: 1) How did they ever find backers to bankroll this movie? 1 hr 42 minutes of almost no dialogue, following a mute around some very unpicturesque neighborhoods. Yes, it is at times very moving, other times wonderfully funny. But I'm amazed anyone thought this movie had ANY chance of selling enough tickets to turn a profit. I'm certainly glad it was made, but also very surprised.2) I found this movie very cynical. (That's not a criticism, by any means; just an observation.) The folks in the neighborhood are almost uniformly cruel, which of course makes Gigot's small kindnesses stand out that much more. Even at the end (SPOILER ALERT), at Gigot's "funeral," the neighbors are all extremely hypocritical. And when they then discover that Gigot is still alive, they go back to their miserable old selves. It's not the sort of thing I would have expected from 1960s Hollywood, but I found it all that much more interesting as a result.3. I was often struck by Gene Kelly's success in capturing little details of everyday street life in an unglamorous part of Paris. Though An American in Paris was, as far as I know, all shot on MGM sets in Hollywood, it seems to have awakened a real interest in Paris for Kelly. This is not a picture-postcard Paris. Actually, the way it was shot very often reminded me of The Red Balloon (1956), which was shot in the same sort of poor Paris neighborhoods. There is also the same sense that innocence will get hurt in such neighborhoods.4. I was surprised, and pleased, that this was not a lot more sentimental. Gleason and Skelton, two of the mainstays of TV in the 1950s and early 60s, often indulged in excessive - for my tastes - sentimentality in their mime sketches. I thought Gene Kelly did a good job of keeping the movie from spilling over into that. In the same respect, the prostitute is not "redeemed and reformed" at the end. In its own way, it's more realistic than I would have expected coming from Gleason.5. The music is very noticeable throughout, sometimes for better, sometimes not. But the sound of that music evoked in me memories of the Jackie Gleason Show, which I haven't seen in half a century. He must have used the same arranger, to get that sound with the strings. Very distinctive. To anyone who watched American TV in the 1960s, it immediately says "Jackie Gleason." I haven't seen the remake with W.H. Macy. I understand it's no longer set in Paris. But then, the Paris Gigot portrays had largely vanished by the time The Wool Cap was made. "Les 30 glorieuses," as the French call the three decades after the War, renovated much of the squalor that you see in the movie; you would have to go out into the banlieue to find an equivalent, and then the population would no longer look "French" to Americans - or, in a different sense, to some right-wing modern Frenchmen.In short, this is a very enjoyable 1h42. If you think most of humankind is cold and hypocritical, you will find plenty of material to support your views. (The scene in the bar where the men get Gigot drunk so that he will make a fool of himself I found very painful to watch. It was well done, yes, but very painful.) If you think dogs and cats are cute, you'll be happy as well. (The use of the cat to lead the camera around in parts of the movie, which again recalls The Red Balloon, is really very clever.) If you're looking for romantic views of Paris, or romance, for that matter, you won't find it here. You will find a good story well performed and well directed. It's not Citizen Kane, but I've sat through a lot worse without complaining.-------------------------------Just a note after a second viewing. This really is one fine movie. Very cynical, yes, presenting a very cynical view of most of mankind. But a very moving film. Gleason's performance really is remarkable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, Heart-Warming movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was created as Jackie Gleason's tribute to Charlie Chaplin's "The Kid" and very successfully captures its essence.The main reason many people today still love silent movies is the actor's ability to portray emotions without spoken word. Jackie Gleason does this cleverly buy making his character mute. Gleason portrays his roller coaster of emotions in the film beautifully. He shows his despair, fear, and the joy of love of another convincingly in a heart wrenching fashion. In addition to his acting Jackie Gleason wrote a beautiful soundtrack to accompany this film, just as Chaplin did in many of his movies. The score he scripts tremendously adds to the emotions felt in this film by Jackie's acting. This film in my opinion is one of the greatest individual efforts in film-making history.It takes an awful lot for me to give a film a ten. But this in all honesty my favorite of all the films I've given nines. I implore you to watch this movie and love it half as much as I do, share it and show it to you friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gleason, too easily typecast for his work with Art Carney, was a powerful dramatic actor. 'Soldier in the Rain' was a role many will more easily relate to. 'Gigot' is a very strange, demanding role, that Gleason masterfully delivers.His performance is a throwback to Chaplin and Keaton, but with this caveat? In the era where those giants worked, films were more action packed and sub-titles existed.In 'Gigot' Gleason is faithful to 1920's film constraints, within context of 1960's cinema. The man's facial expressions, body language are unforgettable to anybody who watches 'Gigot' with a careful eye.Jackie Gleason was a powerful dramatic actor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I got up this past Saturday morning (7-18-09)this movie was on and what a welcome surprise it was to be able to cook breakfast and watch this old favorite. When I was a little girl this was one of my favorite movies. It is just as touching now as it was then. The only thing I didn't realize was that Jackie Gleason wrote this movie and the musical score and that Gene Kelly directed it. No wonder it's a classic! Jackie Gleason totally embodies the "child-like" qualities of Gigot as well as the compassion and innocence of a caring adult. I cried just like I did years ago at the sad parts and I laughed just as I did at the humorous parts years ago. I saw that it is not available to purchase on-line so thank goodness I taped it when it came on again (it was shown twice on our local PBS station. Also this time I happened to notice that the lead Katherine Kath was also the lead dancer in the original version of "Moulin Rouge" (La Goulue). Anyone who has never seen this movie it is truly a classic as it brought back sweet childhood memories for me!</fullReview>

In Gigot he adds another impressive talent for communicating without speaking,with facial expressions he clearly conveys his message. Mr. Gleason carries this motion picture,easily.It tells the story of a deaf mute in Paris in the early part of the 20th century, where he befriends a little girl.The mother is a free spirit who enjoys the company of men &amp; their money. Gigot Is a goodhearted soul who just wants to share himself. The mother doesn't particularly like Gigot but the little girl loves Gigot. You can not help but root,cheer and laugh for Gigot.The troubles Gigot gets himself into are entertaining &amp; heartwarming.This is a great movie to see check it out if you're a Jackie Gleason fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 1962 movie Gigot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does anyone out there know why this wonderful film hasn't been released on either VHS or DVD? I would like to have a copy of this film on DVD if at all possible. I remember seeing this years ago and loved it. I have looked everywhere possible on the internet and several video stores. Does someone hold the rights to this film. If so, why do they not release it? I came across a movie which is available - different title, different actors, but this is not the same. The one I am looking for stars Jackie Gleason, the movie is about a deaf mute who looks after this little girl who's mother is a prostitute. I believe Gene Kelly directed it? I think this probably is the best movie I have seen Jackie in. A far cry from the newer Smokey and the Bandit films, not even the same league as far as I can see. This film Gigot has a lot of heart. If anyone knows how to obtain this film perhaps they can point me in the right direction if there is any at all that is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Special Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was around 7 or 8 years old. Having grown up seeing the Honeymooners every week, I was expecting a silly comedy. Jackie really proved his acting ability in this movie. My sister and I cried through the whole movie due to his moving, endearing performance!A mute who is as childlike as his new little girl friend, both discarded by a ruthless urban environment. This movie never received it's due. I wish I could find it on DVD, I'd buy it in a second. The little girl was so genuine and really had chemistry with Jackie. The remake of the movie (The Wool Cap) was a disaster in my opinion. It had none of the heart and divine sad comedy of the original. This is definitely a movie worth seeing, especially if you think you're not a fan of Jackie Gleason. Plus it was directed with a dancers eye, the fabulous Gene Kelly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remembered watching this movie as a child (with my father) and never forgot it. Though I didn't think about it for some 20 years, when the name resurfaced...I think I happened to notice that it was going to be shown on TV...I vividly remembered many of the scenes. Needless to say, I've sat and watched it a few times since then and would never pass up the chance to see it again. It's a very memorable movie...and for good reasons this time. I am familiar with many of Jackie Gleason's movies and I think this has to be one of his best, if not the best. I was so impressed by how he was able to play such a major part (and very well) without speaking a word. The music was good and the scenery just added to the experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gigot / Wool Cap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "Wool Cap" is a made for TV screenplay co-written by William H. Macy based on the story from Gigot. I hope now that this great film has been honored with a remake, the studio will release the original. Does anyone know why it is not available? Lawyers holding up the process? It's a shame. The original was a masterpiece and must be released. Jackie's performance was one for the ages. The humor built on his generosity with the young girl was so heartwarming that his frustrations with his condition are amplified. His scene when he strikes himself because of those frustrations is breathtaking and burns into you psyche. Please do not miss this movie when it airs on cable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gleason's acting is nothing short of superb as is the photography (filmed on site in Paris) and the soundtrack.If you are only familiar with Gleason as "Ralph" in the Honeymooners and as a loud-mouthed TV comedian, you will be amazed at his performance here.I first saw this movie on a rainy night in Iowa City when I was just looking for "something to do". Not a great fan of Gleason at the time, I chose to see it because it wasn't so far to walk in the rain as the only alternative. Glad I did and I've never forgotten it.In my opinion this is one of the better films to ever come out of Hollywood. It's a shame that it's not commercially available, but if you sail to the right port, you might be able to find it on the internet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Simple, Beautiful Film I've Remembered for Over 40 Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been over 40 years since I have seen this movie. I was only 4 years old in 1962 when I first saw it and it has been embedded in my mind and heart since then. Wanting to own this movie, I have desperately searched for it many times over the years to no avail. Gigot is a movie of simplistic beauty and it's story is one that can't help but bring the viewer to tears. Gigot reached me on so many levels. It spoke to me about kindness to strangers, cruelty to the handicapped (for lack of a better word), and victory for righteousness. Jackie Gleeson's portrayal of Gigot is gentle, perceptive, and deeply profound. I don't believe he did better work in his life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I too saw this movie as a child and have waited 20+ years for it's return. I've never seen any actor evoke so many different emotions with one expression. FYE-when recently checked,it is not available on DVD or video as far as I know. I also thought I was the only person who knew or loved this movie, it's wonderful that so many people love it. When Jackie Gleason died, the local radio station did a "salute" to him. It was noted that Jackie's favorite movie that he was in, was GIGOT. I stumbled across this movie by accident at 4:45am this morning on cable. When are they going to stop repeating some movies 4-5 times in a month(sometimes 10 -12 times in 2 months), and do a Jackie Gleason retrospective AND promote it so that all of us that loved this movie, can actually be prepared to see it! GIGOT was shown once this month and is not scheduled again for either October or November as far as I can tell. Is cable totally unaware of how loved it is?</fullReview>

I stayed up and watched it- and subsequently was late for work the next day. I was riveted to the TV for a black and white!! A moving experience to say the least. This poor bum stealing bread and subsequent actions were artful and masterfully done. Raised my admiration of JG from not well known to well respected. This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I recommend this film for any student, or layman who likes good movies. If anybody knows where i can get a copy let me know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Supremely tender film; great for kids of all ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw it in theater, aged 12 and not given to emotional display, and it was the first film I recall that squeezed out a tear. Filled with the small kindnesses that affect me more than overblown tragedy. Highly recommended for kids inasmuch as it shows the triumph of tenderness over prejudice and disability. Kudos to Gene Kelly for even taking the unlikely project, and for Gleason for a one- man "role reversal" in shades of oxy-maroon: from the brash, harsh and outspoken man he (and Ralph) was to the timid, gentle mute of Gigot. Perhaps he felt that he could have been a star even in the silent era, and he was right. A performance powerful in its portrayal of the powerless, yet never forgetting its comedic core.</fullReview>

But it doesn't compare to that of THE GREAT ONE in "Gigot." Mr. Gleason's acting abilities were TOP NOTCH in this very touching film where he didn't speak a single word. And the music he wrote for this film... TOP NOTCH as well. Everything in "Gigot" has the touch of Jackie Gleason on it and that is what makes it so very special.Why this movie is not yet on DVD is a mystery to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the opportunity to see Gigot in the theater when it was originally released. It was the second half of a fifty cent double feature Saturday Matinée. I was eight years old and this was first solo trip to the movies- and I was riveted to the screen. When I watched "The Wool Cap", I instantly recognized the story - well done by William H. Macy and the script well updated, but the original left an indelible impression. I credit this film as THE one that made me want to direct television and film - an idea that was considered lunacy in 1962.Gigot is a first rate film with an excellent performance by Gleason and wonderfully directed by Kelly. It needs to be released onto DVD for greater access for film students and those who admire the work of "The Great One".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An artful recast of Frankenstein with the town as the monster...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remarkable film. I, like others, was hooked by the emotional intensity of this film right from the start. But I was wondering what the underlying "story form" or writer's inspiration was, and where the tale was going. Then, towards the end of the film -- the "chase scene" -- the Frankenstein parallel hit me with an, "A-ha, the town is the monster," and things fell into place for me.Some find the ending anticlimactic. But, if you look at it as a cycling back to the original relationship between the town and protagonist Gigot, it is a kind of challenge to us -- the townspeople -- to wake up and rethink how we relate to those marginalized in our communities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like others have stumbled across this film. It is a masterpeice that was expertly directed by Gene Kelly in his years in Paris and written tenderly by Jackie Gleason and John Patrick. There are so many words I could use to discribe this film. I will refrain from using them. I just have to say that if you happen on some strange rainy day to run across this movie. Watch it with a box of Tissues. You will see why Jackie Gleason was considered the "Great One". Forget the honeymooners and anything you have ever seen Jackie in, and watch this piece that should be a Master Class to any film student. I know that Art house wasn't a term for a film in the 60's, but this film is a work of Art that should be put to Video or DVD ASAP. It needs to be remembered by a generation that loves the film genre for I am a member of Generation X that has fallen in love with the artistry of a great actor and a dancer that could direct as he danced, with grace and with a great love for the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie as a 7 year old too; Being legally blind at the time. I related to Gigot more for his big heart and his bumbling, The way people took advantage of him and the way everyone laughed at him. He made me feel sad for him but I felt better about myself knowing that I was not the only screw up in the world. This has got to be one of the best movies I have ever seen and Mr. Gleason did a great job putting everything together. Others have remembered the way Gigot hit himself but the scene that sticks out in my memory is of Gigot running around with the merry-go-round trying to keep his eyes on the girl when he runs into a pole; that is how his whole life was and he was so happy when he was trying to take care of his little family. The emotions that came out of this character without one word being uttered was astounding. I hope I see this movie again, it has been too too long. Cmon somebody, make a dvd.

		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time a few years back, well after Jackie Gleason had died. I must admit before watching it I was pretty skeptical. Once the tape started and the plot began to unwind I must admit I found the whole movie very touching and entertaining. Although he never speaks a word, Jackie Gleason does a marvelous job of displaying every emotion and frustration a impaired individual must feel everyday. The supporting cast was excellent although their French accents were very heavy and occasionally hard to understand.I highly recommend this movie as a family movie or "date flick."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a comedy, but it is leavened by sorrow and heartache, rather like the best Charlie Chaplin films. In fact, given that Gleason plays a mute who's performance is therefore entirely physical in nature and the fact that he was involved with writing both the script and the music, the end result bears a strikng resemblance to the silent comedies, not only Chaplin's, but those of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd. The movie is very well done, with just the right balance of humor and pathos most of the time, although it does occasionally get a bit heavyhanded and veers off somewhat here and there. A little film, but a good little film. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie! The part I loved most was when Gigot was trying his best to tell the little girl who Jesus was. Showing Jesus as a baby, then a man, then the cross. It really correlates to how God felt trying to tell the world about Himself, by coming to earth and allowing Himself to be treated cruelly . So, Gigot was doing good up to the time he became frustrated and started to mutilate himself, when the girl caught on. She must have seen through Gigot voluntary act, that Jesus also went to the cross voluntarily to show us who He was. A loving savior. As that's how those of us that believe in Him, also caught the message. Gigot was willing to do the same for this little girl, through his apparent 'frustrated act'. Bravo to his ability as a writer and actor. Should have gotten an award.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot understand why anyone involved in this production would think it had any chance of success. Dreary, boring and ever so sad it is a prime example of too much money and too much talent squandered in a futile stab at cinematic greatness. This really exists as a quaint testimonial to Jackie Gleason's admiration of the great Buster Keaton - however Buster was a man of his time. Gigot in 1962 - certainly a stretch by anyone's standards. I am reminded of "Chaplin" - a truly excellent film with a wonderful performance by Robert Downey Jnr. Quite often if it's not exploding and there is too much dialogue audiences are uncomfortably challenged and we can't have that can we?</fullReview>

It featured an incredibly maudlin storyline, some of the worst overall acting I've ever seen, and some of the cheesiest sets ever.Jackie Gleason was great in The Hustler. He should have left well enough alone. This movie was obviously intended to showcase much of the tired, overwrought and stereotypical "sad clown" acting skills he used as a fallback way too often. Unfortunate, as he could be much, much better than this movie allows. It is as deep as a dime and worth as much.However, if one of your goals is to add to your "worst ever" list, by all means watch it. You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>
