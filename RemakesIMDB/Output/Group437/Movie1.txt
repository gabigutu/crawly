		<shortDescription>A Classic Comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before there was Mike Meyers, Adam Sandler, Eddie Murphy, JIM CARREY -- of course -- there was the great and late Danny Kaye. In "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty", Mr. Kaye gives a brilliant and hysterical performance as the highly imaginative Walter Mitty, who escapes his own real life and pictures himself as a whole new person, whether it's a hat designer, professional gambler, a war hero, surgeon, etc. Yet his imagination is no longer fiction when a real life event and adventure takes place in the dull, but unique life of Walter Mitty.Anyhow, I was really surprised at this movie. I thought it was going to be boring, because 1947 is 34 years before I was born, but I was really impressed by this movie. As a matter of fact, I thought it was A LOT funnier than a few comedy films they have these days. Danny Kaye really puts a smile on your face in this film. Anyone would love watching this film! It's a true classic! :o)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whatever the setting, and there were many, Danny Kaye always played himself -- the hypochondriacal, stuttering, cowardly, nervously fiddling neurotic. That's pretty much what he is here, and if you haven't seen a Danny Kaye movie this is a pretty funny introduction.The plot violates James Thurber's short story, the point of which was that Walter Mitty daydreamed so much because his own life was so dull. It's probably Thurber's most popular story, although "If Grant Had Been Drinking at Appomatox" has more outright laughs. Here Kaye is involved in one richly comic episode after another.The famous fantasies are pretty much gotten out of the way before the movie is half over. The "real" scenes are at least as amusing. He's a copy editor at a pulp magazine in New York and Boris Karloff, he of the ominous lisp, is pitching him a story about a doctor who murders people without leaving a trace by pressing on a nerve at the base of the skull. "Oh, we've already used that in 'The Revenge of the Gland Specialist'," objects Kaye.The plot is a mystery about the planned theft of the Dutch Crown Jewels. Something to do with a murder Kaye witnesses (nobody believes him), a black book, Kaye singing silly songs, a chief conspirator nicknamed "the Boot," and a dazzling innocent blond -- Virginia Mayo -- who has a pretty sassy figure.Watching her and Kaye talking about corsets reminded me that when I was a teen, all women seemed to be wrapped up in inexplicable buckles, plastic straps, and clips that only a deranged mechanical engineer could design. Come to think of it, I'm still out of it. I don't know whether women leave body gel on or wash it off, or what bath beads are. And when did "lipstick" turn into "lip rouge," and "rouge" turn into "blush," and "mascara" into "kohl" -- or DID it? Somebody is pulling the wool over somebody's eyes around here.You ought to see this if only for the costume design and hair styles. Wow -- what exotica! It's impossible to believe that women ever dressed like this, or hoped to, despite Fritz Feld's glutinous paean to a hat that, although it looks like something Calder might have dreamed up during a horrible hangover, can be disassembled into three -- count 'em -- three separate parts and then be piece together into yet another arrangement. Put a tiny quail under that feathery apparatus and you're talking a two-hundred dollar entree at a four-star Parisian restaurant.There's a likable element of running gags in here too. On three occasions Kaye's blustery boss is holding important business meetings when Kaye enters unexpectedly -- once simply late, and twice more crawling backward in through the tenth floor window pursued by pigeons.Kaye's decline was sad. He wound up singing "Thumbelina" to a nearly empty night club in later years. But he's at his peak here, and his peak was pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Danny Kaye in his most fun-filled film role...great fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny Kaye at his best in a fantasy/comedy about a hen-pecked (by his mom and girlfriend) man who daydreams that he's a hero rescuing a damsel in distress (Virginia Mayo) from all sorts of perils. In real life he stumbles across her path and instantly becomes involved in an espionage plot involving villainous Boris Karloff. It's all played for laughs and Danny even gets to do a couple of his tongue-twisting musical routines.Especially enjoyable in the supporting cast are Ann Rutherford as his silly girlfriend and Florence Bates as her overbearing mother. Thurston Hall has fun with his role as Kaye's harried, blustery boss who, while browbeating him, is nevertheless prone to borrowing ideas from Kaye for new sales angles in the pulp fiction market. Kaye has a field day when his dreams take over, impersonating everyone from a sea captain to a riverboat gambler to a fashion designer--all with his own distinct flair for comic routines. A funny, witty, always entertaining little gem that has somehow been overlooked through the years. Virginia Mayo makes a delightful co-star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Danny Kaye Shines as Thurber Gets The Goldwyn Treatment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While WONDER MAN and THE COURT JESTER might be more consistently wacky, I thought THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY (TSLoWM) brought out the vulnerable side of Danny Kaye, one of my faves since childhood (I never missed any of Kaye's movies on WPIX when I was growing up). It usually gets on my nerves when I see movie characters allowing themselves to be as put-upon and henpecked as Kaye's Walter is here, but there was a sweetness about him that made me root for him instead of merely growling, "Oh, tell 'em all to go to hell already" -- and as a result, it's that much more satisfying when Walter finally does tell off his obnoxious so-called friends and loved ones (unlike such "comedies of cruelty" as MADHOUSE, where the last 10 minutes of Revenge Against The Oppressors are the only entertaining parts of the movie)! Although James Thurber, another of my faves, reportedly tried to buy off producer Samuel Goldwyn to keep the film from being made and hated the finished product, I think perhaps Thurber wasn't being quite fair. First off, books and film have different storytelling requirements, and second, the first 10 minutes are almost straight from Thurber's story (except it's Walter and his nagging mom instead of a nagging wife :-), and it seemed to me that the characters and performances had very Thurberesque qualities about them. Boris Karloff and Konstantin Shayne are delightfully unctuous villains (Fun Fact: their henchman, Henry Corden, later became the voice of Fred Flintstone!). As Walter's literal and figurative dream girl Rosalind van Hoorn, frequent Kaye co-star Virginia Mayo was thoroughly beguiling and never looked lovelier (and hey, the radiant Mayo was a size 12 and nobody considered *her* a "plus size," thank you very much! :-). TSLoWM also contains two of my favorite Kaye/Sylvia Fine musical numbers: "Symphony for Unstrung Tongue" (am I the only one who finds the line "He gets so excited that he has a solo passage" to be subtly salacious? :-) and "Anatole of Paris." To top it all off, it takes place primarily in my hometown and favorite city, New York City, and is set in one of my favorite milieus, pulp magazine publishing! My hubby and I like to think that Uncle Peter's grand home must be located in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, where we used to live, since it looks like the kind of homes we used to see while walking around in the Fieldston area and it didn't seem to take horrifically long for Walter and Rosalind to drive there from the Flatiron district of Manhattan! :-) (Interestingly, the interior of the van Hoorn home looks a lot like the interior of evil Bruno Anthony's home in STRANGERS ON A TRAIN; anybody know if these scenes might have been shot in the same house/set?) I wish the DVD extras had included deleted scenes (there's a bit in the trailer with Karloff and Corden in a pub that I definitely don't recall seeing in the finished film), but it was nice to see Virginia Mayo still alive and well (and bigger than "size 12," but on her it's pleasant plumpness, in my opinion! :-) in the intro and outro, even though she only had time to say one line about most of her co-stars ("Ann Rutherford was delightful...Fay Bainter was a consummate actress...").</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of greatest actors you should know...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I have to admit that Danny Kaye was completely unheard of to me before I saw this movie. During the summer one year, the 'Morning Movie' featured 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.' A wonderful surprise for me was the actor Danny Kaye who I had never heard of before. Instead of another boring movie that I would have to watch because there is nothing else to watch. Danny Kaye became the actor I needed to see more of because I couldn't stop laughing. Unquestionably, this movie is full of characters that complement Danny Kaye, but he is the 'star' that makes this movie shine. The variety of the storyline is well written, but not just any actor could lead this cast. If you are looking to see what a real funny movie should look like, check this one out. The movie is good, but Danny Kaye is what makes it great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In New York, the clumsy Walter Mitty (Danny Kaye) is the publisher of pulp fiction at the Pierce Publishing house owned by Bruce Pierce (Thurston Hall). He lives with his overprotective and abusive mother (Fay Bainter) and neither his fiancée Gertrude Griswold (Ann Rutherford) and her mother (Florence Bates) nor his best friend Tubby Wadsworth (Gordon Jones) respects him. Walter is an escapist and daydreams into a world of fantasy many times along the day. When Walter is commuting, he stumbles in the train with the gorgeous Rosalind van Hoorn (Virginia Mayo) that uses Walter to escape from her pursuer. Walter unintentionally gets involved with a dangerous ring of spies that are seeking a black book with notes about a hidden treasure."The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" (1947) is a hilarious comedy about a clumsy daydreamer that gets into a dangerous ring of spies. Last Saturday I watched the annoying "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" (2013) with Ben Stiller and I decided to seek the original 1947 movie that is better and better, with many gags. Danny Kaye is very funny performing the clumsy and coward Walter Mitty. Forget the 2013 remake and prefer to see the original 1947 comedy. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not Available</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen this movie in years yet just thinking about it, I can vividly recall parts that make me bust out laughing. You can tell the cast worked hard to keep their composure during some of Danny Kaye's antics. You can actually see them working to keep from busting out in laughter. They demonstrated a lot of professionalism. I can only imagine what the out-takes are like and how the crew might have had to be muzzled to keep from ruining miles of film footage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Danny Kaye's best films and quite possibly his most endearing performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since seeing him in Hans Christian Andersen when I was 8 or so(a film I still love) I've liked Danny Kaye a lot, and feel that like many commentators here that he is deserving of more attention. He is wonderful in The Secret of Walter Mitty, one of his best performances and quite possibly his most endearing. His antics are genuinely funny and he is charming in a way that comes naturally to him and is conveyed just as much to the audience. He has a fine supporting cast too, Virginia Mayo is astonishingly beautiful and as likable as Kaye, Ann Rutherford is charming and na?ve, Boris Karloff plays cool and subtly sinister to perfection, Florence Bates is wholly convincing in overbearing mode and Thurston Hall is appropriately blustery without overdoing it. The Secret of Walter Mitty looks beautiful, the scenery is bursting with colour and vibrancy and the photography is expertly. The music fits with the action and comedy very well indeed, and the songs are catchy and a lot of fun. The best being Anatole of Paris though Symphony for Unstrung Tongues has some great lyrics/lines and is interesting for future director Robert Altman as an extra. The writing is witty and infectious, it never feels forced or mushy and it holds up well today too. The story is sweet and instantly lovable, children will be spellbound and amused by the dream sequences especially. Overall, a wonderful film with Kaye on top form. If you want to get acquainted with him or see what the fuss is about, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a great place to start. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Poketa Poketa Poketa Poketa"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is generally known that this, the best known film made from a purely James Thurber story (THE MALE ANIMAL was a collaborated play) was not liked by Thurber. One can understand why. The actual short story is not at all like the film, except that the central figure (Mr. Mitty) keeps having extremely odd day dreams where he does all kinds of heroic things that are totally at odd with his humdrum life. He is married, and obviously is hen-pecked. Every incident of the story sets off one of his day dreams, and (in the conclusion) he is heroically facing a firing squad. A sort of perfect conclusion as his fantasy life mirrors the deadly control of his real life by his wife.The movie's Walter Mitty (Danny Kaye) is not married, but he lives with his bossy mother, works for an overbearing boss who steals his ideas (Thurston Hall - he publishes Mitty's dime store adventure stories), has an overbearing girlfriend with an overbearing mother, and has a male "friend" (Gordon Jones - "Mike the Cop" on Abbott&amp; Costello's television show) who is a loud mouth and overbearing. Mitty tunes them all out to make his life bearable. He sees himself as a great surgeon, a captain of a ship rounding Cape Horn in a typhoon (and steering with a broken arm), as a Mississippi gambler, and as the great Parisian couturier "Anatol of Paris".Then one day he runs into a blonde woman (Virginia Mayo) who is trying to flee from a gang of desperate men, including Boris Karloff (as the head of an asylum). They are trying to get her to reveal a valuable secret that will net them all millions. Mitty is dragged into this, and finds himself being pursued by the gang, and trying to fend off the interference or criticism of his mother, boss, girl friend, etc.One can understand Thurber's anguish, as the Goldwyn film mangles the mood conciseness of the original story. It is really a comic mood piece, commenting on the living hell Mitty has that only his imagination can free him from. The movie altered this into an adventure film dealing with a milquetoast who finds his level of real bravery. As a real artist, Thurber could only regret the changes in the story. But the film was first rate entertainment, and is among the best movies in Kaye's comedy career.To find out how Walter finds his guts at the end, and what the "poketa, poketa" machine and sound is all about, watch this delightful comedy. Then reach for the Library of America volume on Thurber, and read the original, to see how the material was originally put down on paper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Danny Kaye is wonderful as the nervous and overlooked Walter Mitty in this classic film. The short story it is based on is nowhere near as spectacular as the movie, but still shares a special glow with it. Virginia Mayo sparkles as the damsel in distress that Walter must save from numerous recurring villians and hazards. Together, they bring this story of a simple man with fantastic daydreams excellently to the screen. A very good film to watch with family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny Kaye plays Walter Mitty a meek, mild man who has been pushed around all his life by everybody. He takes refuge in elaborate daydreams where he is always the hero. Then he runs into beautiful Rosalind van Hoorn (Virginia Mayo) who is involved with spies and secret codes. He gets involved...but starts to wonder...is she real or just another day dream?I'm never seen a Danny Kaye movie in my life and he seems to be forgotten today. If this movie is any indication of his talent he deserves to be rediscovered. He was very good in his role--the one liners came fast and furious and he was also a very good physical comedian. I admit I didn't find everything funny but I was never bored. Mayo was undeniably a very beautiful actress with limited acting ability. Still she was OK. Boris Karloff pops up as one of the bad guys and gently kids his bad guy image. Very quick-moving movie, quite funny at times and (in the print showing on TCM) in just beautiful, bright Technicolor. Unfortunately they're doing a remake with (God help us!) Jim Carrey! See this--avoid the remake (if it's made). The author of the short story this was based on (James Thurber) HATED this movie. Too bad he was wrong.The only debit for me were two LONG songs by Danny Kaye. There was nothing very wrong with them but they come out of nowhere and bring the movie to a screeching halt. For that I'm only giving this film a 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the world of Hollywood, there are many actors who qualify as talented. But few are noted as multi-talented. One example is Thespian John Leguizamo, who can do it all. Where some performers can sing or dance, some are very good when acting. But few can do all three activities and still make it look as though they are creatively natural when they star in films. Many years ago, such a rare quality belonged to the most universally multi-talented actor ever. His name was Danny Kaye. In this film, Mr. Kaye stars as ever-dreaming Walter Mitty. He is a man who is forever loosing touch with reality and dreams of being a hero in secret lives. Walter Mitty's dreams become intertwined with reality when a beautiful woman named Rosalind Van Hoorn (Virgina Mayo) gives him a little black book which is sought after by Dr. Hugo Hollingshead (Boris Karloff) who convinces Mitty he is going mad. The movie has a way of making it's audience dream along with the hero and for the sake of pure entertainment, you can have no better fun than to watch Kaye exercise his great talents in entertainment. A great film which has already earned the crown of Classic. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though it is not as good as another one of Danny Kaye's films "Wonder Man", this film is very entertaining. Kaye is as usual in great shape, and Boris Karloff is also in the film as a phony sinister psychiatrist. The awful Goldwyn Girls are not as bad as they are in most Goldwyn films, and Virginia Mayo is quite fitting in the role of the girl that Kaye falls in love with. The best things in this film are the scenes with Boris Karloff and Walter Mitty's dream sequences, especially the one where he is a tough cool gun-slinging cow-boy. The musical numbers that Kaye sings are pretty well-known, but talking from a personal point of view they are not my favorite. But a very good film with some truly good moments. Enjoy! 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like Danny Kaye's style you should see this movie. I like his style of making people laugh, so I'm amused with "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty". The scenes in which "Mitty" imagines himself to be a brave British pilot (and when he pretends to be his old music teacher), a hat designer, and a gambler from the old South are my favorite "dream sequences" of the film. Regarding the scenes that take place in "the real world" I think the takes with Doctor Hollingshead (Boris Karloff) and the one in which Mitty pretends to have a gun in his pocket are very funny. The partnership between Danny Kaye and Virginia Mayo is here at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Star Vehicle for a Much-Missed Comedy Performer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching the Danny Kaye version after having watched the Ben Stiller remake is a fascinating experience. The modern remake has definite virtues - notably Stiller's little-boy-lost performance in a sophisticated world of New York advertising, as well as the subtext offering an elegy to LIFE magazine, now doomed to appear on the internet only. On the other hand Norman Z. Mcleod's Technicolor version of the Thurber story contains one of Danny Kaye's best performances on film. He was nothing short of a genius - a brilliant slapstick comedian, with an apparently limitless range of facial expressions, with a natural instinct for delivering comic songs full of verbal pyrotechnics. Structurally speaking, the film has a story of sorts, but is basically a star vehicle for Kaye to show off his talents, playing a distressed sea- captain, an English flying ace (complete with cut-glass RP accent), a brilliant card-sharper (complete with cheroot) and a cowboy storming into a studio-set bound western town. His wife Sylvia Fine provides the music and lyrics for two specialty tunes; in one of them he plays a mid- European professor impersonating most of the instruments of the orchestra. With all this verbal and visual wizardry going on, it's hard to concentrate on the plot; but it doesn't really matter, as Kaye is such an endearing performer that he can quite easily win his way into the audience's affections, especially when he plays direct to camera as if performing in the live theater. The film contains one or two good supporting performances, notably from Virginia Mayo as the love-interest playing several roles in Kaye/Mitty's fantastic dreams, and Boris Karloff as a crooked psychiatrist trying to push Kaye/Mitty out of the window of an upper-floor skyscraper, and then putting him under psychological influence in an attempt to extract vital information out of him. But basically the film belongs to Kaye, a superb star vehicle for a fantastically talented actor and performer, who was as much at home in front of a live audience as he was in front of a movie camera.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original, and best (the 2013 version doesn't come close). Great story, well told. What takes it to a new level, however, is the performance of Danny Kaye. He is superb in the role of Walter Mitty: hilariously funny, especially in the day dream skits. While the dialogue is incredibly sharp and funny, you can't imagine anyone else delivering the lines so incisively. His slapstick stuff is also something to behold.So funny and original you can actually see the influence (direct or otherwise) of Kaye's performance on acts like The Goon Show, Monty Python, Robin Williams, and even Michael Richards (esp as Kramer in Seinfeld). Rest of the cast put in solid performances. Virginia Mayo is particularly good, and beautiful, as Rosalind van Hoorn. However, the supporting cast are just the straight men to Kaye's antics. He IS the movie.Only negative is that it does get a bit too silly and farcical towards the end, in the real life parts. The day dream stuff is brilliant and there the movie doesn't put a single foot wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They call him the dreamer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Thurber's whimsical day dreamer Walter Mitty was a perfect character for Danny Kaye to apply his many talents with. Make note however this is not film based on Thurber's short story, The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty, but the character is used to fashion a plot whereby this day dream believer gets into a real life adventure. And gets the girl one only dreams about.Poor henpecked Danny Kaye as Mitty works as a proofreader for publisher Thurston Hall who specializes in putting out pulp fiction works of adventure and romance. He's put upon by everyone, from his mother Fay Bainter to his girlfriend Ann Rutherford, her mother Florence Bates, his best 'friend' Gordon Jones and not the least by his boss Hall. His escape is in daydreaming and it's in these imaginary sequences that Kaye's real talents of singing and mimicry are given full range. During one of those sequences while at a fashion show Kaye does one of his most famous routines Anatole Of Paris.While on a train Kaye meets the beautiful girl of his dreams Virginia Mayo who is carrying some documents vital to her native Dutch government. And she's being pursued by the kind of international criminals that appear in James Bond or Austin Powers. Konstantin Shayne is the master criminal known only as 'the Boot' and he's assisted in his nefarious schemes by Boris Karloff. After he meets them poor Danny spends the rest of the film trying to help or rescue Virginia Mayo and convince the others in his life that he's in a real situation. The rest of his circle put his ravings down to an overactive imagination and he's even referred to a psychiatrist who turns out to be Boris Karloff. I'm not sure who was playing straight for who in the psychiatrist sequence, but it's funny nonetheless.It's not James Thurber. Thurber's story would be almost impossible to create accurately for the screen since it's all in his protagonist's mind. But as a character for Danny Kaye, Walter Mitty is a natural.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Fun; Swift+Paced Noir Comedy; Great Production Values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Thurber, literary creator of Walter Mitty, refused to watch this film which was made of his creation. This may not be HIS Walter Mitty, but it is not Danny Kaye's either. The Mitty we see here, daydreamer, cog in a machine of enterprise in New York City (a publisher dealing with and in lurid comics) is therefore very like the Thurber Mitty. He is also supplied in this popular and classic version of Mitty with a beautiful girl (Virginia Mayo), a sinister organization after her, a fiancée he does not want (Ann Rutherford), a nagging mother (delightful Fay Bainter), and a boss (Thurston Hall) who considers him impractical and a daydreamer--which he certainly is. But Danny Kaye's Mitty dreams not to escape reality but to envision himself as more effective within it. So, his dreams embolden him to do what he would probably hesitate to do if he were not trying to measure up to his own fantasies-for-the-sake-of-an-idea notion of what a hero is. The villains of this fast-moving and very funny comedy thriller are led by Boris Karloff. Kay tries to help Mayo; no one believes him about the Uncle they have spirited away; she denies him in public and begs his help again in private; his forthcoming marriage is wrecked; his life is threatened; his work is interfered with--and after being trapped in a sinister house, he manages to win the day and marry the right girl--and be promoted to second-to-the-boss. He plays several fantasy parts, a gambler with with a code of honor, a gunfighter, a WWII plot performing "Anatole of Paris", and several more. Others in the fine cast include Konstantin Shayne, Gordon Jones, Henry Corden, Fritz Feld, Doris Lloyd, Reginald Denny and Florence Bates. The director Norman Z. McLeod had fine help from cinematographer Lee Garmes, set decorator Casey Roberts, composer David Raksin, costume designer Irene Sharaff and illustrator Dorothea Hull. Forget the plot; the Hitchcockian McGuffin in this case is that the bad guys want something that Mayo's Uncle knows about. Then relax and watch the fun. Favorite moment: the bubbles that fill the air about Gaylord Mitty's floridly-dressed figure. A classic in its own way; but read the original short version by Thurber also.</fullReview>

But he's not sure if it's real, or if his imagination is running wild (as it so often does!)Adventure, Comedy, Romance, this movie has it all, especially an outstanding and unique premise, where each twist of the plot is a joy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedies can actually be funny....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies you just cannot help but love. You can try to detract from it by needling it apart at the 1947 seems but the fact is that Mitty is fairly faultless. Maybe because it really isn't saying anything. Its simply a well told tale with a blistering performance from a true comic genius. I had heard of Danny Kaye from my mum and so when I saw this movie i realised my old dear had not been lying. Danny Kaye is truly a comic great. The two scenes which basically resemble a solo stand-out are cinematic moments of greatness. The film does have a story and a plot which though not twisty-tervy is still engaging and the beauty of Virginia Mayo, and the magnificence of the techni-color make it a spectacle. Any fan of modern day comedy should watch this film and see if they notice any similarities between Kaye and any of todays stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The escape artist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" has aged well. The Technicolor hasn't faded, or turned pinkish, as the copy we recently saw on cable showed. The film, based on a James Thurber's short story, was made as a vehicle for Danny Kaye. Walter Mitty is a daydreamer. He escapes his monotonous life by imagining himself as the hero of the different situations that hold his attention. One day, Rosalind Van Hoorn sits next to him on the commuter train and things change for Mitty. He becomes a hunted man by some unsavory characters that want to recover the black book that was placed in his briefcase, without his knowledge. Thus begins the story about this wool gatherer who lives in an unreal world.The film is pure escapism. Walter Mitty is a small boy inside a grown man who is not too worldly. His engagement to Gertrude seems unreal because we don't see anything between them that might denote love. When Rosalind comes into his life, Walter begins a process of growing up and he falls for the glamorous woman.As played by Danny Kaye, this Walter Mitty, is at times puzzling. Mr. Kaye was an actor who relied on his mimic talents to create Mitty. Virginia Mayo makes an elegant Rosalind. Ann Rutherford is seen as Gertrude. Boris Karloff has some good moments as the zany Dr. Hollingshead. Fay Bainter is perfect as Walter's mom.The original songs by Silvia Fine, who was Mrs. Danny Kaye, are serviceable, but not great. The Goldwyn Girls are seen in the fashion show sequence. The direction by Norman Z. McLeod holds the picture together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not The 'Riot' It Should Have Been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being someone who could always identify with the fictional "Walter Mitty," I was anxious to watch this film years ago. Sadly, it wasn't anywhere as good as I had hoped it to be.Some of the slapstick humor is just plain stupid and, of course by now, much of that humor is very dated. Also, I don't care to hear Danny Kaye sing, even if he's a decent singer. There are two or three songs in this movie and one of them goes on forever.On the "good" side, I loved the look to this film, from the great automobiles to the overall '40s look and interesting color in this film. Also, some of the scenes were genuinely funny. Not everything was corny or stupid. Virginia Mayo played an interesting character in here, too, and it's always fun to see Boris Karloff.The coming attractions to this movie make it look like it's a riot, with dreamer "Walter Mitty" fantasizing about being all these glamorous characters....but those previews highlight most of the good parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the ta-pocketah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A delightful comedy-fantasy showcasing the many talents of Danny Kaye in James Thurber's popular short-story, although it's interesting that the author didn't want it filmed and apparently hated Kaye in the lead.And so what, says I! Yes, helmsman Norman Z MacLeod, perhaps worn down from his days as the director of the Marx Brothers in the 30's, does indulge his star a little too much by unnecessarily giving him two lengthy patter-songs which while highlighting his tongue- twisting and accent-mangling skills, nonetheless don't belong in the film and likewise our hero's pratfall goofiness is overdone too.Nevertheless when, I suspect, Kaye sticks more to the script, there is some genuinely funny humour, often of the grown-up variety, like the scenes where Kaye's Mitty attempts to intercept the delivery of a corset (containing the Maguffin of the mysterious little black book listing Dutch art treasures pursued by a German criminal mastermind) to an unknown female with a suitably large and jealous husband, Virginia Mayo undressing to her slip after being out in the rain and the funny exchange where Mitty is convinced by evil psychologist Boris Karloff that he sees fully-dressed women instead in bathing-suits. Along the way, the movie gently satirises the then fashionably popular pulp-fiction magazine business, international women's fashion and of course various movie genres in Mitty's various day-dreams and it's in the latter that the film is most successful and funny.The pleasing conclusion where Mitty finally comes out of his shell and bites back at everyone that's trodden over him in the past from his mother on down is slightly let down however by a pointless final scene where Mitty at last gets his overdue promotion, but I won't hold that against it. Kaye and Mayo, here teamed for the third of four movies, combine delightfully and are well backed by their supporting cast, especially Karloff spoofing his horror-movie past. Filmed in glowing Technicolour around contemporary post-war New York, (even if some of the location shots are clearly processed), this is a vibrant, funny feature from Hollywood's Golden Age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fanciful Dreamer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is, of course, no mere coincidence that the favourite song of Walter Mitty is Beautiful Dreamer given the amount of time he spends day-dreaming. This original screen version of a celebrated short story by James Thurber is light-years ahead of a second version starring Ben Stiller and released last year. Coming up to seventy years old it still retains both charm and zaniness and boasts a remarkable performance from Danny Kaye. No truer to the story than the remake - in the Thurber story Mitty was a hen-pecked husband rather than a son - the dream sequences in which Mitty sees himself as a sea captain, surgeon, riverboat gambler, British flying ace, and a milliner with his own song - are fine compensation and segue neatly into the real-life dangerous situation in which he becomes embroiled. It's difficult to visualise anyone other than Kaye in the role, especially in 1947 when there wasn't really any other actor who could have handled the Symphony For Unstrung Tongue, one of the two pieces of 'special material' written by Kaye's wife, Sylvia Fine (the other piece was, of course, Anatole of Paris). Definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a hilarious film, a true marvel of comedy. I personally would rather watch this, rather than any of Adam Sandler &amp; Jim Carrey's comedies. The setup is great: a shy pulp comic writer who yearns for adventure is whisked into an exciting caper involving Nazis, Boris Karlof, and a beautiful woman in a green dress. Danny Kaye shines in this, clearly having tons of fun playing the titular character, Walter Mitty. His inflections are perfect. His relationships with his boss, his fiancé, his mother, and his real love interest are all so perfectly executed. It is hard to believe this movie was based on a short story of the same name. I remember reading the story in grade school and then watching the movie. This film is pitch perfect in tone and style. Very rarely will anyone ever see a movie involving a Mississippi river boat, a singing Air Force pilot, a doctor in the middle of surgery, and Nazi treasure in the same adventure. Bedtime Stories tried to do a movie like this, but Adam Sandler's complete lack of a comedic bone in his body made that movie fail, while this film shines. I highly recommend seeing this film, especially in lieu of the remake directed by Ben Stiller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Danny Kaye was a genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Daydreaming has gotten a bad rap. "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" shows that it can actually be quite good. Walter Mitty (Danny Kaye) is an everyman who works at a magazine drawing cartoons for them. But privately, he imagines himself as various characters: a riverboat gambler, a surgeon, a gunslinger, etc. Nothing interesting ever happens in Walter's real life until he meets Rosalind van Hoorn (Virginia Mayo). After he meets her, his life takes the most unexpected turn. This movie is a classic masterpiece in the real sense of the term. Maybe some people might say that the movie is basically an excuse to be "cute", but I thought that it was more than that (I mean, how can you say that a movie is "cute" when it co-stars Boris Karloff?). Marvellous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Secret Living</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewed for a second time, the Danny Kaye version of 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' is not quite as fresh and original, but it still stands up as one of the more offbeat films of its year - and far superior to the Ben Stiller version. Bright-eyed Kaye is well cast as a perpetual daydreamer cartoonist who uses fantasy to escape the mundane nature of his everyday life. The first third of the film is spent acquainting us with the flaccid border between fantasy and reality in his mind before the plot sharply veers towards absurdism as Kaye encounters Virginia Mayo's damsel in distress and finds his life thrown into disarray with a more elaborate conspiracy than anything he had ever dreamed of - just like one of his comic book heroes' lives. The Technicolor sets and costumes (especially the hat show) are great. Further delights include a brief but brilliantly menacing Boris Karloff performance and a thoughtful audio design linked in with the fantasy/reality divide. Not only are the "tapocketa, tapocketa" sounds a great running gag, but many background noises in the film are also played at louder than usual volumes during the reality-based scenes. Less delightful are the musical numbers that Kaye is stuck with singing. The tunes are decent but jar with the narrative flow and the first one goes on for way too long as Kaye imitates a former lecturer. Never to mind, the film's celebration of the human imagination is nicely tantamount to a celebration of the power of cinema itself; after all, how far removed is writing cartoons from writing inventive motion pictures?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some magic, but just not enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Instead of LIFE magazine and a journey dealing with life reaffirmation, the forties 'Mitty' instead has our hero as a daydreaming author of cheap pulp stories, and engaged to a vapid airhead with a snappy dog and overbearing mother. One day however, Mitty's life gets turned on its head when the mysterious blonde from his daydreams actually enters his life, protecting the secrets of an elderly collector from a villainous mastermind known as The Boot. Misunderstandings, hijinks and Mitty's bumbling-turned-heroics ensue.For all its earnesty and warmth, the '47 'Mitty' ends up feeling bloated. This is in part due to an overuse of the daydream gimmick, here all taking cues from the character's pulpy background; sailing on stormy seas, ww2 ace, Southern Gentleman Gambler and Western showdown among others. Each one is colourful, and the actors all embrace the archetypes, but after the third vignette, the daydreams loses any story function and feels more like a showcase for Danny Kaye's comedy talents, and the pacing is irreparably crippled. What should be as straightforward as a fish out of water/unlikely hero story for 'Mitty' keeps getting interrupted by these daydreams, despite the rest of the narrative having enough momentum, and it gets really grating. If you are one of those people who thought the new 'Mitty' had padding/filler, the older version will have you ripping your hair out.A shame, as we have buckets of amusing gags within and around these bits, as well as charismatic performances spearheaded by the sadly forgotten Kaye who is able to go from goof to suave smoothly, and even has decent singing chops. Heck, we even get the always magnificent Karloff as a secondary villain, a killer doctor, and he's just as much fun as you'd think he would be in this role. What's more, because of the choice of vignettes and occupation, this film also serves as a fun little spin/capsule on 40s popular culture, and even little jabs at it, especially with the character of Mitty's boss, the Publisher.In the end, the '47 'Mitty' is by no means a bad or even horribly dated film, but honestly, I have to give the point to the newer version. Yes, it may have had some sap in it, but it flowed much more tightly and smoothly as a narrative, and the daydreams served a story purpose as opposed to being a cheap gimmick like here. If you want to get into more fantastical 40s comedies, I recommend Kaye's other film, 'Wonder Man' (1945) instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boris Karloff the psychoanalyst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The audience is led to think this is a light and happy Danny Kaye movie. However, there are quite a few scenes that present disturbing psychological issues. Any way you look at it, the film has a rather simple thesis: get away from an overbearing mother with the girl of your dreams.Some of the daydream sequences are a bit extended and reveal two things. First, that the screenwriters have unleashed their imagination at the expense of a more succinct and tidy plot. And second, that producer Samuel Goldwyn is selling a sort of extravagance that rivals anything MGM ever put out. Perhaps Goldwyn hopes moviegoers will become so mesmerized by his shimmering Technicolor production that they will not care about its obvious faults.This is not a bad film, and indeed, it has many redeeming elements. But it mystifies this writer how Mr. Kaye and costar Virginia Mayo manage to keep their hair, makeup and clothing perfectly intact during a scene that is filmed inches away from a bubble machine. And how is it that the minute we find out Boris Karloff has been cast as the psychoanalyst our greatest fears are about to be confirmed?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . or soccer games with Himalayan Sherpas in this early adaptation of the James Thurber short story, THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY (1947). Apparently, Mitty is in the eye of the beholder, and the producers of this flick wanted a cross between Harpo Marx and Gene Wilder's "Willie Wonka," as anachronistic as that may seem. Danny Kaye pushed their buttons, so we're treated to tongue-twisters, slapstick stumbling jags, and patter songs in lieu of big-budget travelogues, volcanic eruptions, and mountain skate boarding. Where the 2013 Ben Stiller remake relies on stunning visuals, while occasionally being plagued by Non Sequitar groaners (such as the ludicrous BENJAMIN BUTTON spoof), this original from the 1940s has a plot featuring four actual "plotters" (though the ultimate goal of these knock-out drug-wielding kidnappers is much murkier than that of the similar gang in Hitchcock's NORTH BY NORTHWEST). Seeing Frankenstein's monster playing a shrink will be a hoot for many, though Boris Karloff is cast here as a fake psychiatrist (who tosses Mitty out of a high-rise office window!). Don't limit yourself to one Walter; as they say, "the more the Mittier."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fanciful fantasy and farce, filled with fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine what Danny Kaye could do with a title like that! As other reviewers have noted, this movie strays far from the plot of James Thurber's short story by the same name. Thurber was a wonderful writer for The New Yorker magazine for years, and left many readers smiling with his witty style and frequent politely cynical barbs. But, I agree with those who think this film is much better for its diversion. "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is a wonderful comedy that let's the skillful and versatile Danny Kaye entertain us with his many talents. A closer following of the short story would not have been as comical. And that leads to some observations that I haven't seen mentioned by other reviewers to date. A couple of these are my reasons for not rating the film a "10." First, while the film seems to keep moving with action and comedic twists, it still seemed to be too long. I think the reason for that was that there were too many scenes of nagging from Walter's mother and fiancé. Too much repetition of the nagging dampened the continuity of the humor. Just a couple of early scenes would have been enough for most viewers to get the message that Walter led a haggard life with overbearing people. In themselves, the naggers are not funny, as many viewers might know from their own lives. One or two people commented about Walter's songs. While Kaye's tongue- twisting ability and funny songs were signature skills for him, they didn't seem to fit right in the movie. They are very good scenes, and I wouldn't drop them from the film. Rather, better screen writing, direction and editing could have made the comical musical numbers fit and seem to belong. I should note one other aspect of this film that I really enjoyed, but I didn't see commented on by others. That was the subtle and more obvious very funny jabs at the culture and groups within it in different scenes. The first was Walter's arrival at his office. He walks by posters that advertise magazines and stories. "Terror Stories," "Sensational Murders," "Wild Confessions," and "Jungle Tales" show art work and pictures of aliens, gruesome murders, and other horrors. Walter stops at one artist's work table and says, "You could use a little more blood on the ax." As he goes into his office, he passes by a large sign on the wall that reads: "Good Taste and Good Reading for Thirty Years ? Pierce Publications."The film takes jabs at the dime novel and sensationalist magazine and tabloid industries. Another scene, involving one of his daydreams, pokes fun at the customs and culture of the time regarding women's hats and Parisian fashions. One wonders just how exaggerated some of the examples of hats really were. All in all, this is another very good comedy and showcase for Danny Kaye and his talents. The entire cast is very good. This isn't the best of Kaye, but "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is an entertaining movie that the whole family can enjoy ? even these many years after it was made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day Dreaming with Walter Mitty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Talk about a problem with source fidelity! "Monkey Business" director Norman Z. McLeod and scenarists Ken Englund of "No, No, Nanette" and Everett Freeman of "George Washington Slept Here" kept one scene from James Thurbers' short story "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" and jettisoned everything else. Indeed, Mitty is still a day dreamer in the story as he is in the film. The filmmakers replicated one scene from the story and changed everything else. The Walter Mitty that comedian Danny Kaye incarnates is a mild-mannered bachelor who lets his overbearing mother bully him. In the story, Mitty is married, but he is only dating a girl in the movie. The scene that was lifted from the short story is the surgery scene when Mitty repairs a piece of hospital equipment so doctors can operate on their patient. Since the story is pretty short, the filmmakers had to flesh things out and have they ever more fleshed things out. Mitty works for a firm that publishes crime and romance magazines. In the short story, we never learn what business that Mitty is in as a career. The premise of "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is that the Dutch are trying to recover famous artwork and Mitty has a notebook about these artifacts. Mitty meets the heroine, Rosalind van Hoorn (Virginia Mayo of "White Heat"), and she is trying to locate with the help of another man a number of valuable paintings that disappeared during World War II. Everybody is searching for a black notebook and nobody believes Mitty when he tries to convince others that he is up to his ears in trouble with some ruthless characters. Danny Kaye is perfectly cast as the eponymous character. Fay Bainter plays is obnoxiously overwrought mother who constantly reprimands him. Mitty day dreams about surviving a storm at sea in the opening moments. Naturally, our bumbling hero thwarts the villains, "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is a hilarious comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The troubling and sometimes upsetting life of Walter Mitty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Mitty (Danny Kaye) is a simple man, working at a publishing company, with the simple goal of making it through the end of the day alive, hoping not to be too harassed by his obnoxious mother (Fay Bainter), his boss who takes him for granted (Thurston Hall), and his childish fiancée (Ann Rutherford). The only place it seems Walter can escape to his own mental fantasy land, made up of whatever he wants them to be. His daydreams feel like the kind of material fit for a pulp magazine or a thriller novel, and become so much a part of his life that when he's interrupted in the middle of one it's difficult to assimilate back to reality. Walter then meets a mysterious woman named Rosalind van Hoorn (Virginia Mayo), who he can't distinguish to be part of his reality or his alternate reality, resulting in nothing but more problems from his overbearing family who just can't let the poor man be.Norman Z. McLeod's The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is sharp around the edges because of the fact that it understands life as a simple man, with simple goals, who mentally escapes to a place of greater satisfaction. The trio of writers (Ken Englund, Everett Freeman, and Philip Rapp, respectively) make Mitty so innocent and so humble that his commonality and instantly-likable charm is hard for us to ignore. He clearly is motivated and doesn't want to do wrong, but is constantly treated like an imbecile by his family who seem to not appreciate anything he does.Such a character may have been hard to like if he wasn't played by Danny Kaye, a cinematic master of timing and zealous energy. Kaye is on top of his game here, racing around the sets, owning the screen in nearly every scene he is in, and beautifully utilizing difficult comic skills such as fast-talking, miming, and character dialog in order to create a character we enjoy watching and sympathize, maybe empathize, with. This is my first Danny Kaye film, but could also very well be his tour-de-force performance. The focus is almost always on him and his daydreams.His daydreams, on the other hand, are also noteworthy, because while campy and lighthearted - like the pulp magazines they are trying to emulate - create a certain suspense in their espionage glory, to the point where they're not trivial. They're, in fact, what the film has to thrive on. We, the audience, need to see why Mitty is sucked into this dream world and why it's more interesting and fun to him than his own reality. The trio of writers, combined with director McLeod (known for his work on quite a few Marx Brothers films, as well as other comedies of the thirties and forties), work wonders here when it comes to articulating the excitement and the sensational effect Mitty's dreams have on him and us.The final aspect is the darker element, which comes to light when Mitty, himself, begins to feel as if he does have a mental illness (thanks to being convinced by everyone) and that these consuming daydreams may be harmful to his psych after all. He sees a therapist (Boris Karloff of all people) who begins to see this in him as well, as Mitty states how greatly the daydreams interfere with his life and work. Consider this from Mitty's point; he has a redundant job, where he is grossly undervalued, a manipulative mother, a fiancée who doesn't seem to appreciate him, and a life scarcely providing benefits. His only outlet, his elaborate daydreams, is one that's highly criticized, the subject of him possibly possessing a mental illness, and regarded as a humanistic flaw rather than an ability. Mitty lives a sad life and the filmmakers don't sugarcoat it; it's a tough life as Walter Mitty and we're shown how dreary it can be.I sought this film out, obviously, because of the recent remake, with Ben Stiller serving as the director, producer, and lead actor of the film. I have no idea what to make of the film other than it looks very ambitious and has the grand potential to inspire and captivate. Kaye, however, seems to be having more fun with the idea, while illuminating the film's darker qualities. Stiller's approach seems more driven on ambition and motivation; a go-for-broke kind of attempt that could hit big or miss big, depending on the way of the writing and the emphasis on the themes. However, being released in a very busy time period in cinema, the original Secret Life of Walter Mitty may deserve more than an honorable mention of the forties decade.Starring: Danny Kaye, Fay Bainter, Thurston Hall, Ann Rutherford, and Boris Karloff.

A Technicoor production with music by Sylvia Fine (songs) and David Raskin (score) and cinematography by Lee Garmes.Milquetoast Walter Mitty (Kaye) escapes the incessant needling of those around him by dreaming up exciting adventures for himself. Upon meeting gorgeous Rosalind van Hoorn (Mayo) he gets thrust into a real adventure involving Dutch treasure, but this is real stuff and his life is under threat!A lovely Danny Kaye vehicle full of neatly constructed comedy, pleasant tunes and Technicolor supreme. It's too long at ten minutes shy of two hours, and non Kaye fans are unlikely to be converted, but for the fans this is a delightful way to spend an afternoon as the spy plot unfolds in a whirl of energised malarkey.

		<fullReview>I'd certainly agree with the verdict of Australian moviegoers that Secret Life? is Danny Kaye's best film. Admittedly, it's not his funniest. That's Knock On Wood. Or his most appealing. That's The Court Jester. But it's the all-around best because Kaye himself is not only in top form. but the support players, the director, the photographer, the set designer, the costumer, and the songwriter too. Boris Karloff, of course, heads the list of outstanding support players, especially in the Australian version, in which he has a brief introductory scene that introduces him in his frightening alias, The Boot. This was considered too horrific for American and British audiences, so the sequence was cut after adverse comments at previews. But Australians are made of sterner stuff. The Oz censor had classified the film as Suitable for General Exhibition without any cuts and everyone knows that it doesn't pay to argue with the censor. Let sleeping censors lie is a fine motto. See Miracle of Morgan's Creek in IMDb.Thurston Hall's delightfully blustering publisher ("30 years of good taste!") is next on the most ingratiating support players list, followed by Fay Bainter's querulous widow ("What's this? I told you to buy a cake, not a rake!"), Virginia Mayo's simperingly decorative day-dream heroine, Florence Bates' typically pushy mother, and most especially Ann Rutherford, who turns in a totally believable performance in a rare, unsympathetic role.McLeod's impeccably timed, consistently stylish direction adroitly delivers every laugh, chuckle and thrill the screenplay provides, while the delightfully atmospheric color photography gave the film such real class that Goldwyn accorded Lee Garmes (as well as McLeod and himself) a single-frame credit. And speaking of Goldwyn, of course, it's just a natural that the film should boast such superlative production values. If anything, however, Sam outdid himself with Walter Mitty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the finest performances by Danny Kaye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny Kaye really shines in this film, playing the slightly neurotic Walter Mitty. Mitty gets mixed up with some bad guys, a pretty lady, and almost gets fired, all in two days. The dream sequences are great. Mitty is always day-dreaming, and in each, Danny Kaye plays a new character. War hero, surgeon, hat designer, cowboy, ship captain, he plays them all. A definite must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY is an amiable, imaginative comic fantasy starring everyone's favourite jester, Danny Kaye. Kaye plays an ordinary and rather boring fellow who escapes the humdrum of modern life by venturing into various fantasies where he's always cast as the hero, rescuing damsels in distress and defeating nefarious enemies.Unfortunately for him, soon reality and fantasy begin to collide when he meets a classic Hitchcock femme fatale who propels him into a world of murder and intrigue. What follows is a riotous 'wronged man' style comedy with plenty of slapstick and broad shenanigans to recommend it. Overall this is a colourful and lively production, boosted by Kaye's endless energy and the interesting casting of key roles, like the excellent Boris Karloff as a sinister psychiatrist.The only flaws here for me were the actual fantasy sequences themselves, particularly the early ones. Some of them feel quite twee and dated and seem go on on forever, like when Kaye's singing that stupid song. It feels like they're there for padding rather than any proper reason. Still, THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY works much better when it's taking place in the real world, and that slapstick is hard to dislike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>KARLOFF PLAYS A PHONY PSYCHIATRIST!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has a cast of all time veteran actors. Walter Mitty (Danny Kaye), a very soft spoken proofreader for a magazine publishing house, tries to escape periodically from his routine existence in DAYDREAMS. A woman(Rosalind van Hoorn (Virginia Mayo)"The Girl from Jones Beach" '49 seeks his aid in getting away from a strange character who seems to be following her. Later on Mitty gets involved with an international ring of jewel thieves. A phony psychiatrist is among the gang members, Dr. Hollingshead (Boris Karloff) who attempts to push him out of a window. Karloff does everything in the book to convince Mitty that he's NUTS. If you love Danny Kaye, who played Capt. Hook in Peter Pan TV 1976, you will love this film. Karloff gave this film and extra boost and played a calm and sinister doctor for a change!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantasy, Reality and Foolishness-Secret Life of Walter Mitty **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny Kaye was made to play such a role- a day-dreamer who eventually gets caught up in reality and must convince those he loves that what he is experiencing is true.Faye Bainter gets it right as the sweet, over-protective, yet over-bearing mother. Ann Rutherford is totally churlish as his fiancé, more concerned with her daughter, and Florence Bates is very good as her mother, sarcastic to the core.Walter's day-dreaming allows him to escape from his life of being forever bossed around by all. Thurston Hall shines as his boss, always ready to find fault, but accepting his ideas.Walter's dreams take him to being a top surgeon or an ace pilot. He finally gathers reality by becoming mixed up with Virginia Mayo, the girl of her dreams, who leads him to possible danger in exposing past Nazi art stealing criminals in their search for a black book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Danny Kaye Stinker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this film a '4' for Technicolor. Otherwise, it would be a '3.' Danny Kaye, like Jerry Lewis, has never been a favorite of mine; same with The Three Stooges, Laurel and Hardy, etc. I don't care for slapstick.Had the antics of Danny Kaye been eliminated from the film it would have been improved upon. Author, James Thurber didn't like Kaye nor the music. Thurber's short story is void of music and Kaye isn't a good songster.I saw this film when it opened in 1947. I was barely six years old, fell asleep toward the end and missed the part where Walter actually was NOT fantasizing; no big deal - I still hate the film 66 years later. I also daytime and nighttime dream but write them down and turn them into narrative. I sell enough to supplement my measly social security benefit which I paid for during 45 years of an internal audit career. With a college degree, CPA/CIA, I get $18,000 a year on social security with a recent 1.5% increase for 2014. Throw a dog a bone. Back then, we sent our kids to college, vacationed, bought new cars and spent our money enjoying life. Social security and a small pension was supposed to be enough. Dream on, Walter Mitty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>through the haze of memories from my young age, I'm still fond of this movie. sure, It has all the pro and con of a movie of that time. the nouvelle vague was still to be created.but the story of this nobody transposing real life dullness into fantasy heroism was appealing for a 8 years old kid pretending jumping over Niagara while stepping along the boardwalk.but it is the Waldo Kitty anime that made remember it. in this young audience show, a cat (real) dreamed (in cartoon) he was the cat-pitaine Kirk or the lone ranger.now on the verge of 40's, I realised that the show and the movie teached me how to use my imagination at the best of my interest without confusing reality and fantasy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun fantasy flick from the 40's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fun movie that I have seen many times especially when I was growing up it was fun to see on television. It's adapted from the James Thurber short story in basic premise and character but is not true to the story but that's OK this is a Sam Goldwyn picture and he put a lot of talent in Danny Kaye, Virginia Mayo, Boris Karloff and Ann Rutherford on the screen and a lot of veteran movie making talent off screen to make this film. Famed comedy director Norman Z. McLeod who directed two of the Marx Brothers most famous films Money Business and Horsefeathers directs. McLeod also directed W.C. Fields in two films and George Burns and Gracie Allen in a couple films as well as directing films starring Bob Hope, Cary Grant, Red Sklelton and Jack Oakie. Lee Garmes, another long time veteran of films is the cinematographer and famed stage and film fashion designer Irene Sharaff who would win five Oscars in her career is the film's costume designer. Veteran producer Leon Fromkess is the production director. Kaye plays a mama's boy daydreamer who encounters a ring of jewel thieves and imagines himself in a series of sketches as a riverboat gambler, an RAF pilot, a surgeon, a western gunslinger, a sea captain and a women's hat designer. Samuel Goldwyn Jr. has been trying to do a remake of this film to follow more closely the Thurber story for years. Steven Spielberg was originally to direct Jim Carey, then Ron Howard was to direct, several scripts by various writers were drafted and finally Mark Waters was set to direct Owen Wilson but now Wilson is out and Zach Braff may star in the Mitty role. Danny Kaye does a great job in this 1947 flick and it's well produced and directed. A good representative of the fantasy genre popular in the 1940's I would give it an 8.0 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pretty good comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first movie i've seen of Danny Kaye and he was pretty good in it. I remember reading this story in high school English class and actually liking it. Danny Kaye plays a sort of loser who still lives with his mother, doesn't much like his fiancée and doesn't like his boss. He is always daydreaming about being a top surgeon or a war hero or a boat captain or a cowboy. Kaye works in a book publishing company and one day on a train to work he winds up meeting Virginia Mayo, whom he had seen in a dream the night before. The next thing he knows, he's involved in some stolen paintings and a murder. There are men like Boris Karloff trying to kill him and doesn't know what to do. It's a pretty good movie and and just like the story i read in high school.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant Silliness &amp; A Decent Showcase For Danny Kaye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This pleasant piece of silliness is entertaining, and it also makes a decent showcase for Danny Kaye to show off his variety of skills. It takes Thurber's classic short story about the daydreaming Walter Mitty, and adds a plot around it that, while perhaps not up the standards of the original story, certainly provides good comedy plus some adventure.As Mitty, Kaye gets to act out his character's various fantasies, with most of them pretty amusing, and in the movie he also gets caught up in a genuine adventure. It's played mostly for laughs, but as such it works well. The supporting cast is good, especially Boris Karloff who is perfect for his role. The combination of slapstick and action (plus a little singing) isn't really anything to take seriously, but it's a fun way to spend a couple of hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A showcase for Danny Kaye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if this is a spoiler or not, but has anyone noticed the plot, situation, and character similarities between this movie and "My Favorite Brunette," with Bob Hope, made in 1945? Virginia Mayo = Dorothy Lamour = the damsel in distress; Danny Kaye = Bob Hope = unlikely hero; the black book = the map = what the bad guys are after; even Boris Karloff has a look-alike opposite number in the psychiatrist character in "Brunette." There is an impostor uncle in a wheelchair in each. There is a murder in a car in each movie; the hero enters a house to save the heroine, with the full knowledge and even assistance of the bad guys. The two movies even share a credited actor, Reginald Denny. That said, I just want to add that I really find Kaye's gibberish songs (written by his wife) kind of annoying. The rest of the movie is fun and Virginia Mayo is my idea of the quintessential glamorous movie star of the forties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable but it doesn't quite hit the mark...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is an enjoyable old film. However, it does have a big strike against it. The studio really made this a Danny Kaye film instead of basing it closely on the James Thurber story. Had it stuck closer and featured less over- acting by Kaye, the film would have greater lasting power today. Instead, it occasionally is cringe-inducing and also has way too much in the way of intrigue.Danny Kaye plays the lead. At times, he's wonderful as well as charming and likable--and at other times he does much more of his Borscht Belt shtick instead of remaining true to the character. So, while I liked Mitty's little regressions into the fantasy world in the story, here they often are just excuses to have Kaye do his act--such as the weird linguistic exercises that folks apparently thought were funny back in the day. I seriously doubt it would go over very well today. If they'd just stuck to him having charming little day dreams like the Thurber ones, it sure would have worked better. Including a plot about Nazis and stolen Dutch art as well as the stand-up routines just tended to derail the otherwise excellent story. Worth seeing but far from Kaye's best work and unfortunately it really did little with the wonderful original source material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Danny Who?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tracked down 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' after seeing Danny Kaye in 'White Christmas'; for some reason I thought there was something more to this smiling, charismatic second banana who could sing and dance with the best of them.I was right; although he's forgotten today, Kaye was extremely popular in his own time, and especially in the post-war era leading up to 'White Christmas'. No offense to his fans, but there's probably a reason his movies don't often make it onto TCM prime time; most of them weren't very good at all! 'Walter Mitty' is, unfortunately, probably his best work. There was some behind-the-scenes drama in the production of Mitty; Kaye's wife, Sylvia Fine, insisted on tinkering with Thurber's script in order to insert some of her custom-made patter songs. Personally, I think the songs are one of the highlights of the movie, but as a result, the story sometimes struggles to make much sense all. I still don't understand why Virginia Mayo's character disappeared at the police station, but maybe we're not supposed to think about it that much.The dream sequences are all very good and surprisingly clever and funny and fresh. I laughed out loud to the punchline of the song, "Anatole of Paris". In fact, if you pay close attention you'll notice that many of what seem like throwaway lines are in fact all part of a cohesive lampooning of women's fashions.The production values are great. Usually, films which are overproduced annoy me to no end, but spending a lot of money on costumes seems to work here.I love Danny Kaye and wish he'd made some better movies. This one isn't so bad, however.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blah, Blah, Blah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a big fan of James Thurber and not a big fan of Danny Kaye, I have some reservations on this movie. While Danny Kaye tries to be a Walter Mitty, he does not succeed. He does the same Danny Kaye stuff he does in all of his movies and it gets boring seeing the same actor doing the same gags in all of his movies. It is like one big never ending story. While the movie was based lightly on the James Thurber work, it does not transfer the Thurber energy, the slant which Thurber puts on his stories. It's always fun seeing Boris Karloff in some roll besides being a monster. It is also fun to see the Goldwynn Girls. If RKO would have stayed a little more true to the story it would have helped the movie.I did however enjoy the remake of Walter Mitty a couple of years ago and it seemed to follow the authors intentions a little better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad Waste of Talent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of Virginia Mayo, Danny Kaye, Boris Karlof -and James Thurber. Also I like comedy-mysteries in general (for example the ones with Bob Hope, Red Skelton and Abbott and Costello). So this movie should have been really good. Instead it is incredibly horrible. The acting was fine- the cast did all that could be done. The problem was the writing. Comedy mysteries aren't easy to write because they can very easily step over the line into the absurd. That is what happened here. It has been made into a farce that in my opinion just isn't funny. And nothing falls flatter than an embarrassingly bad farce. I can see why James Thurber who wrote the original short story on which this movie is based hated it. I don't know why Danny Kaye agreed to do this one. Don't waste your time on this turkey !! Incidentally, I saw this on TCM a day after seeing The Seven Year Itch and I was struck by the similarity between the Tom Ewell and Danny Kaye characters. They both worked for a publisher that specialized in sex and gory violence and both suffered from excessive repression but a very active fantasy life!. However, Seven Year Itch succeeded brilliantly while the Danny Kay movie didn't. !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1965 saw the creation of a wonderful little film, "How to murder your wife," about a cartoonist whose cartoon overlaps with his life. It was a milestone of sorts in film history, spawning similar and more clever notions of all types.So it was with some high expectations I sought out this film from 1947. It is from an idea of one of our foremost humorists, himself a cartoonist. There's supposed to be some relationship among the types of cartoons he draws, the fantasies he imagines and the "real" story in which he finds himself.All three are presented, but there is a poor relationship made among them. It seems as if there are three or two quite unrelated movies that unroll at our feet. This is isn't a case of breaking Ted's law, where the fantasy within is the same "distance" as the film reality is to ours. Those layers exist here in the appropriate place.. They're just not stitched together. It seems as if a second screenwriter came on the scene and took out some important connective tissue, replacing it with unrelated comedic effects. The whole thing flops. If you find yourself in it, pay attention to the dreams. In many of them (most?), he starts out in one role and moves to another.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Thurber's original short story was just wonderful: modest, simple, clear, understandable, straightforward. The movie bears not the slightest resemblance to it. What a pity. Seeing this movie, there's nothing that would send one to Thurber's original lovely and very funny story. Pauline Kael, in "5001 Nights at the Movies," says this: "Worse than there's any excuse for." Ah, yes, Pauline. And the three biggest problems are Danny Kaye, Samuel Goldwyn (shame on him for blowing this little story up to such an unwieldy state) and the inexplicable presence of Virginia Mayo.</fullReview>
