		<shortDescription>To see the world. To find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw an advanced screening of "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" last night. To the right person, this movie is life-changing, life-affirming, and truly beautiful. No, the narrative isn't perfect. The script isn't perfect. There are narrative flaws and stretches of the imagination, but this movie is about stretching the imagination.The concept - of an underachieving dreamer finally discovering the world - is something most of us can relate to. Accompanied by a truly beautiful soundtrack, Oscar-worthy camera work, and the surprisingly able acting of Ben Stiller, as well as an accompanying cast which includes Adam Scott, Kirsten Wiig and Sean Penn, among others, this is heart-warming and truly special.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected this to be funny and perhaps a little goofy. What it is is a breathtaking work of art. This is Ben Stiller at his best. The movie is just wonderful. It's funny, thought provoking, touching at times and startling at others. It's entertaining throughout. The pace may seem slow at times to those used to action packed films, but I personally don't care for nonstop technically enhanced action scenes for no apparent reason. I've been hoping people would tire of those for some time now, so we can get back to good stories again. This was a great story, loosely based on the original short story by James Thurber. I wish there were more movies out there like this. That would definitely get me back into movie theaters. As well...the acting was superb all around. Kristen Wiig was outstanding--as usual. I think this may be her best work as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great experience!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been looking forward to seeing this movie since I saw the preview. I was a big fan of the original story, and although I knew the movie would be very different, I could see that this would end up being one of my favorite movies. I was not disappointed.Ben Stiller is perfect as Walter Mitty. His performance was exactly what I wanted. There was one scene in particular that seemed a little out of place, but then again you have to remember that Walter Mitty has a very active imagination. Ben Stiller's performance was so engaging, a nice break from his usual slapstick roles (which I also love). If you are hoping to see him doing one of his usual humorous roles, you will be disappointed. If you want to see him capturing the emotions of a man that has a hard time expressing himself, you will love this movie.The visuals in this film were particularly fantastic. From the New York offices of LIFE all the way to Iceland. Every scene was perfectly captured and just beautiful.Finally, the soundtrack. While I was definitely distracted by the visuals and Ben Stiller's spot-on performance, the soundtrack deserves a nod as well. Every song fit perfectly with the tone of the film. There are a few scenes that stand out as particularly wonderful, and I'm sure you'll know what I mean once you see the movie. This will definitely be on my shelf once it is released.Really my only criticism is Adam Scott. While he is great at playing the jerk boss, his beard is very distracting. It looks fake, as if they pasted it onto his face. Other than that, I think the movie was pretty much perfect and can be enjoyed by anyone looking to see a beautiful movie about a man with a very active imagination.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Present</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Afghanistan on the snow covered Himalayan Mountains grizzled and world wise Sean O'Connell played by Sean Penn gazes at his coveted photo moment. Sean says that all he wants is to be "in the moment". Sean Penn is selfless gravitas in this moment as he confides in Ben Stiller's exasperated mild mannered Walter Mitty, who literally travels to the ends of the earth to track down the maverick old-school legendary photographer. Be in the moment and be present in life--are the eloquently poignant lyrics of Director Ben Stiller's "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty". I loved the James Thurber short story which Writer Steve Conrad based his update. Walter is the chronic day dreamer, an escape from his ordinary life. At times Director Stiller and Writer Conrad teeter capriciously all over the narrative landscape including a hysterical and touching eHarmony thread. Granted they humorously frame Walter's "zone outs" from reality. One obscure gag from "Benjamin Button" is nearly wacky enough to spiral into incoherence?fortunately it does not. There is the amazing upside. In a joyously freeing scene Walter skateboards down the winding roads of Iceland; spectacularly filmed by Stuart Dryburgh. Kristen Wiig in a touching turn goes unplugged with David Bowie's "Ground Control to Major Tom". All the curious rifting I think is forgivable for its noble purpose. "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" celebrates being present in life. No one is alone. Ben Stiller is quietly heroic navigating Walter's transformation into the unknown. His blank stares as Walter "zones out" touch the depth of our own vulnerabilities. He is bold, funny, and aware. Walter Mitty (Stiller) is a photo negative archiver at Life Magazine. He has given up on his dreams, taking on the financial and emotional stress of his aging Mom brilliantly played by Shirley MacLaine, about to enter a care home. His sister is flighty wannabe actress Odessa (good Kathryn Hahn), dreams of playing Rizzo in "Grease". Walter joined eHarmony so he can date Cheryl Melhof (Kristen Wiig), who works in the same office. Wiig charms as Cheryl, the quirky single Mom of skateboarder son Rich (Marcus Antturi). Cheryl is smart and pretty, and is actually interested in Walter, if he had a clue. Life Magazine has been taken over by another Company. To transition over to an on-line magazine, Ted Hendricks (brilliantly arrogant Adam Scott) heads the restructuring corporate team. Ted is a major jerk? arrogant and not as smart as he thinks. Walter is the sole personal contact of legendary cover photographer Sean O'Connell (Penn). When Sean's photo negative for the cover of Life's last newsstand issue is missing, Ted focuses his attention on Walter. Sean claims this is his best photo of his career. Walter must find the missing negative to save his job and possibly win over Cheryl. Working with Cheryl, Walter starts his search in Greenland. Somehow diverting to Iceland, Walter calls Cheryl from a Papa John's Pizza there. It all ties in. Ben Stiller is inspiring, as "Walter Mitty" amazingly never takes itself seriously. The movie joyfully celebrates life as illustrated by the beautiful soccer game with Walter and Sean in the Afghan mountains. Stiller makes us pull for Walter as he reclaims his power. Kristen Wiig is funny and compassionate as Walter's gentle muse. She is surprising. Sean Penn is awesome as Sean O'Connell, strong and whimsically wise. Shirley MacLaine anchors in her Mother's unconditional love for her son Walter, without many words. Patton Oswald nearly steals the movie as Todd, the eHarmony profile adviser. Warm and hysterical he punctuates Walter's transformational journey. Stiller reminds us with humor and soul that Life is wonderful when we are present in it. "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is funny and beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iconic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have given this a "10" rating. There was one minor issue I had with the movie that would make it not quite that in my mind, but a "9" rating would be an injustice to this extraordinary film and, since I'm unable to give it a 9.75 or something like that, "10" it is. This movie strikes an incredible balance between indy/art-house and Hollywood epic. The pathos of the main character is well-captured in subtle ways, as are the feelings of triumph when he is able to go beyond his own self-imposed limitations. The cinematography is extraordinary-- this is a drama that *must* be seen in theaters. I expect that most adults with any sensitivity at all will find this a highly satisfying experience that speaks to their very cores. My wife and I were privileged to see it in an advanced screening, and can't believe we have to wait another couple of weeks for the official release to go back and see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent and elegant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. I know some critics say this movie is like flicking through a National Geographic magazine. I disagree, this movie is a well-balanced triumph. Fantastic views, simple yet wonderfully poignant story line and strong lead actor. Kristen wig and Sean Penn had unidimensional roles within the movie but they are not the leads. The humor was tasteful, adequate and well placed. It was such a pleasant surprise from your day to day blockbuster and I strongly prefer this movie to the desolation of Smaug which I watched the night before. Ben Stiller has managed to achieve an impossible feat with this movie, an elegant contemporary film without excessive emotional histrionics or sexual overtones. Strongly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a modern take on life. Just like the lead, Walter Mitty is your everyday guy doing an everyday job faced with realistic modern day issues. One day, he takes a leap of faith and that has made all the difference. How can anyone not love this movie?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One really has to wonder what the professional reviewers are really thinking. We looked over the family movie list and barely decided to go to this one based on lackluster reviews. Six out of six of us REALLY liked it and found it deep and entertaining, and easy to watch. By all means, if you are looking to enjoy a movie, go see this one.If you are looking for a connection to the original story, the connection happens during the first 45 minutes and then seems to go in its own direction. Big deal. The movie moves through characters development, plot lines, and geographies smoothly, and does not reveal its final hand until the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Utterly Mesmerising Spectacle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Tropic Thunder', 'The Cable Guy', 'Zoolander'... Ben Stiller has created some entertaining comedies, but 'Walter Mitty' is by far his most audacious piece of direction so far. The story is solid and the cinematography is stunning, Stiller has created an utterly mesmerising spectacle that follows the same basis of the 1947 classic starring Danny Kaye. Whilst I found the majority of the film charming and entertaining, it's the beautiful cinematography from Stuart Dryburgh that really sells this flick, and in my opinion should have been worthy of an Oscar- nomination at the least. One of the most entertaining comedy-dramas I have seen in recent years, a film that Stiller should be proud of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most beautiful looking film of 2013</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie on a special sneak preview event. I admit being utterly mesmerized by some of the trailers. I did really enjoy the film. It has a nice message and is definitely a feel good movie. There is nothing wrong with that. For me, this is the most beautifully looking film I've seen this year. The cinematography and camera shots were fantastic - right up there with Life of Pi and Gravity. It's definitely worth seeing on the big screen. I personally enjoyed Ben Stiller in a more serious role. The film has comedic elements but everything is a bit more subtle and reflective of a man trying to find his inner courage and voice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to open with one word; Wow. I had been wanting to watch this movie since I had seen the first trailer. After being invited to an advanced showing I got very excited. The movie was outstanding. The cinematography was perfect and the character development was extraordinary. The film was very well paced and at no point did i believe the film was too short or that I felt rushed during the movie. It has its action moments and satire, but overall it is a very happy film. I will most likely see the film in the future again because this is up there with Forrest Gump and Django Unchained as a near perfect movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Hours of Fantasy That Has Something to Say About Reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loosely based on the 1939 short story by James Thurber, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty explores the idyllic fantasies of its titular protagonist, as he attempts to escape the mundane motions of his daily routine employment at Life Magazine. When Mitty (Ben Stiller) discovers that photojournalist Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) has misplaced negative 25, intended for the cover of the final print of the publication, he sets out on a larger-than-Life journey to locate the missing photograph, while reducing his need for daydreams as he discovers that not even his wildest fantasies are a match for an adventurous reality.In addition to starring, Stiller also takes on directing duty, and does a mostly wonderful job of collaborating with writer Steven Conrad in adapting Thurber's classic tale of a man's yearning for more out of life.A fantasy adventure with glimpses of comedy, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is, in one word, pleasant. Envision a pyramid of qualities; the film's dreamlike sequences comfortably and rightfully sit atop its magnitude of highlights. With the lines between fantasy and reality often being blurred in Mitty's zoned out state of paralysis, he invites us into his crazy, hazy, even mazy lapses into daydreams of romanticism, adventure and pleasure.Why are The Secret Life of Walter Mitty's fantasy sequences so successful? Because of their relation to our own imaginations: the things we wish we could say but don't; the places we wish we could go but won't. The film's fantasy references are inspired by popular movies such as The Matrix, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Harry Potter and pretty much every superhero film ever. This hilarious and creative approach to Mitty's fantasies offers an insightful look into how uninsightful our own imaginations can be, as they crave originality but settle for what has been imagined before.Perhaps a slight disappointment to Mitty's on screen daydreams is their quantity. While Thurber's short story is dominated by the character's constant drift into his fantasy worlds, Stiller's adaptation favours reality and narrative over fantasy and themes. The film's aforementioned highlights are too few and far between throughout the 114 minute feature. Thus, it may have been Beneficial for Stiller to lengthen the film slightly in order to incorporate more of Mitty's fantasies, which would have better established his dissatisfaction with life.Despite this, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty does have a story investing and intriguing enough for it not to be the film's demise. The secrecy behind negative 25 drives the film along, with love interest Cheryl (Kristen Wiig) also spurring Mitty on in the passenger's seat, inspiring the anxious and rigid dreamer to take his unpredictable ride and become the person he desires to be.The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is refreshing in its lack of reliance on dialogue. Instead, the film's beautiful soundtrack and score, cinematography in exceptional landscapes and even the quietness of Mitty, tells us pretty much everything we need to know. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty consists of visual wonderment, with superbly selected and composed music to harmonise the scenery, complementing each other as they stroll hand in hand through Mitty's perfectly paced journey."Life is about courage and going into the unknown." If you fail to relate to Mitty's early illusory state, cautiousness and absence of courage, then you probably live a somewhat audacious lifestyle, in which case good for you! For the rest of us, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a relatable, pleasant and semi-inspirational modernisation of Thurber's story.Just as the film's concluding third appears to have little payoff considering its memorable opening two, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty wraps up with a revitalising, picture-perfect moment, fulfilling enough to make cinema-goers reconsider 2013's most impressive movies. In spite of its imperfections in almost keeping Mitty's secret life somewhat of a secret from the audience at times, and preferencing the film's plot over his fantasies, this adaptation is nonetheless a satisfying, fun, visually and audibly pleasing present for the holiday season. Not even Walter Mitty would fantasise about battling you through the streets of Manhattan if you waited for The Secret Life of his on DVD or Netflix, but this delightful film is definitely worth the time and box office cost if you find yourself looking for inspiration for your own imagination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adventure is out there if your name is Ben Stiller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty; one of many movies released over this holiday season is about a timid photographer who works for Life magazine and sets off on the journey of his lifetime to find a missing print and photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn). The movie's motive (at least it seems) for audiences of today is to experience new things and find what you're looking for in your life. If you're as shy as Walter, find that experience or excitement and fill that hole, yadda yadda yadda. That message is all fine and dandy, but to what cost? The Secret Life of Walter Mitty becomes so extreme that it takes away from it's original motive; and it suffers. There is just too much riff raff going on in this movie for me to enjoy it.Ben Stiller portrays Ben Stiller, excuse me I mean, Walter Mitty, a shy Ben Stiller *SORRY* ahem, photographer who can't seem to break out of his awkward shell and ask his cute co-worker Cheryl (Kristen Wigg) out on a date. He has a hard enough time communicating with her, but he also has serious day dreaming issues, slipping to and from fantasies featuring exotic mountain climber guy and saving kittens from burning buildings. These fantasies are exciting. They're a great thing to build the plot around, however what seemed to be a bright idea gets shrugged off by the second act. Once Walter abruptly flees to Europe, these fantasies have vanished. What seemed like an everyday problem for Mitty is now magically replaced by shark wrestling skills; climbing mountains and evading volcanic eruptions. Stiller also has one backpack but a bottomless wardrobe(?). The events get so ridiculous, at times you wonder if they are Walter's fantasies or not; which they aren't, and another seemingly clever plot device falls flat. To top it all off, I didn't give two shits about Ben Stiller or his character, Walter Stiller, who was wooden as all hell in his performance. Kristen Wigg's part wasn't large enough for me to care if Mitty ended up with her or not, and the blatant product placement for eHarmony at the end completely sealed the deal for me. Walter Mitty goes on a remarkable, life changing journey and supposedly does some amazing things; yet he's barely a changed man by the the end of the film.Walter Mitty wasn't an awful movie; but I could tell it was Ben Stiller's artistic moment and nothing else. It didn't sell for me. There is some beautiful cinematography with shots of Iceland and Europe; but that isn't enough for me to call your picture any good, Mr. Stiller.From http://bbman94.wix.com/brandonsmoviecorner</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Major let down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, the film started off slow. Roughly ten minutes of silence while BS decided whether to press a 'wink' button or not.. instantly I took a dislike to it but thought I might as well let it slip.There's the odd bit of humour throughout the film but the majority of it doesn't fit with me any more. I've noticed a trend happen in films where they try and make a 'douchebag' guy the 'funny one' through little words and phrases he says that only fails because, in my opinion, that section of comedy has passed. "What's our company's phrase?", "LIFE.. I'm lovin it?", "No, that's McDonald's." ..are you serious? THIS is meant to be funny!? Also, I know the boss is an arrogant dick and everything but it's a little far- fetched when he doesn't know his own catchphrase, I mean, come on? That's really testing the audiences stupidity, who would believe that!?Nothing much is 'quotable' throughout the film, the characters are based loosely on every average character you find in most 'comedies' nowadays (I'm thinking 40 y/o Virgin, Bruce Almighty, Johnny English..). There's a hot woman, who, from the off point, you just know he's gonna get with her by the end.. the 'action' was well-produced but completely unnecessary. The 'zoning out' that Walter Mitty does gets repetitive and boring.. yeah, it was sorta funny at first, but after the 6th-7th time we just ended up thinking "for god's sake, another one!?" and it starts to get predictable. Also, with that in mind.. what the hell was with that Benjamin Button reference? You can tell it was meant to be funny but it was just.. so awful. "Just stay here baby.. I mean 'baby' as in, my partner, not baby because you look like a weird baby thing" then he replies with a weird (what I can only assume is the sound of his last breath and him dying) "ouguhhhhhhhh" ..come on, who wrote this script!?Speaking of predictability, I felt like every twenty minutes before something happened, I was turning to my girlfriend and saying 'this is gonna happen now..', 'watch this happen..', 'what's the bet this happens..' and no word of a lie, I must've done it about 7 or 8 times and was right every time. It actually got to the point right near the end where I said "Can I just tell you what's gonna happen so we can go?".. she just laughed and if it hadn't have been from the embarrassment of walking out of a cinema before the film finished, she probably would've said yes. (P.s. I told her anyway and lo-and- behold, I predicted right.)I think what makes this film achieve such a good amount of positive reviews (and, I gotta say, for this reason and this reason alone, I agree) is the scenery and genuine 'adventure' that we follow with him. I was watching an interview with BS and he said the places we see are the places he actually went to, he actually went to Iceland, he actually went to Greenland, he actually went hiking up a mountain.. and for these reasons, I can see why it would appear to be a decent film to watch but unfortunately, that's solely what the film seems to have promoted itself on and it takes a good 40 mins to an hour to get there (probably longer) and even then, I feel like I'm just watching the trailer all over again.That aside, I wouldn't recommend it. The comedy is cheap, the characters are typically average of a film and are clear exaggerations of real-life people (douchebag boss, overweight best friend that makes the odd 'funny' remark, the OTT ridiculously-costumed sister character, the 'girl' that's too hot for her age and position and generally too good to be - but he gets her anyway), the story is a bit crap.. he gets fired, yet he still travels around the world to find a small picture that was on his person the whole time? Come on!Tbh, rounding off, the only reason we stayed til the end (other than embarrassment if we had left) was to see what the picture was.. I mean, after sitting there for what felt like 5 hours, we might as well stay for what the story was all about, eh?Summing up, my advice? Save your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant romance for the holidays.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Life is about courage and going into the unknown." Cheryl (Kristen Wiig)Forget Bridesmaids and Hangovers, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a comic romance for everyone that eschews raunchiness for real life challenges a dweeb named Walter (Ben Stiller) faces daily. He is everyman, a dreamer who gently supplants his daily dreaming with real life romance.The first part of the film loosely adapts James Thurber's short story in which the now famous introvert dreams of various heroic adventures, mostly as he tries to impress his co-worker Cheryl. The latter part of the film concerns his real adventures tracking down a famous but reclusive photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn). Director Stiller plays it low key while he gently shapes the passive hero into an active one. The director calmly moves into a reality more exciting than Mitty's dreams. The multifaceted film, however, loads on the schmaltz and one- dimensional characters while it also touches on the curse of downsizing, using the demise of Life magazine as a setting for the loss of jobs, which Walter experiences. Yet, Mitty is lovable enough for the audience to hope this formerly introverted dork can save himself from unemployment and loneliness. The entire family can enjoy a spirited albeit superficial comedy without scatological or romantic excess. And the lesson about living the dream comes gently and believably. An enjoyable comedy this is. "To see things thousands of miles away, things hidden behind walls and within rooms, things dangerous to come to...." Life Magazine</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Main Problems With This Film (spoiler free)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a chance you may like this, in which case I don't really want to taint your expectations with the things that follow. If you like whimsical fantasy and tend to like everything you watch, then don't read on. If you have some taste and a good sense of judgement, then you'll certainly be irked by the film's problems. Its tonally uneven - towards the beginning, it mixes dry office based observational humour with slapstick action scenes. It works for a while, but then changes tone completely about a third in. Now its trying to be meaningful and spirited, but it doesn't quite work. Its still too fantastical to be taken seriously. Some scenes towards the end are so long and boring, lacking any humour or emotional punches whatsoever that you'll find yourself suddenly snapping and thinking "hey, what's going on here? What am I watching here?"The film uses fantasy daydreams as a plot device, but then after about a third of the way through, drops them completely. They're barely referred to again. Yet, the rest of the film contains elements so fantastical, whimsical and absurd that you WISH he was still daydreaming. Except he isn't. It feels really jarring, and you beg that he snaps out of a daydream so that the film isn't so ludicrous. So many things happen which are absurd. Cell phone calls whilst he's climbing up the Himalayas, having been travelling for days by this point. Flies at the drop of a hat, with just his briefcase, then has an endless supply of clothes and appropriate gear. Hasn't been or done anything interesting but is suddenly an expert skateboarder. He jumps into a helicopter being dangerously piloted by a drunkard, based on some fantasy encouragement by one of his daydreams. What kind of message is that? Live your life! Be reckless! Do dangerous things whilst drunk! Your friend drink at the bar all night? Hey, live you life, let them drive you home! His motives are never really clear. He goes to search for a lost negative from a photographer - because he wants to a) travel or b) keep his job? If a), then he could have picked plenty more goals and destinations, and the drive to start now isn't particularly strong. If b) then there are plenty of other ways to do it, and it makes no sense (he could have just said the negative was missing from the package). His personality is never really explained. He processes incredible photographs for a renowned international magazine, yet hasn't been or done anything interesting at all in his life? If his imagination was that active for his day dreams, then surely he'd have put it to better use by now? And if he has some huge fear barrier to making decisions (as shown in the opening scene) then why? Whats the emotional truth here, and how will he resolve it? Its never answered - but when he does finally go travelling, he experiences no fear at all (except for a stupid scene where he literally fights with a shark).The message of the film seems to be "make your life more interesting, and do things, so that the opposite sex will find you more attractive". This is a really superficial, shame based message, the complete opposite of films which imply "be liked for who you are, not for what you do or can provide for people". Ben Stiller plays it pretty dry and wooden, without expressing much emotion at all. I can't remember him laughing, looking sad, scared, exhilarated, nothing. Even when skateboarding down a mountain, he has the same facial expression. His lack of emotion throughout makes it hard to really engage with the character or care at all about this fantastical adventure he's supposedly going on. Sean Penn's acting is, as ever, fantastic, but feels like it really doesn't belong in this film. By the end, it feels like a massive advert for eHarmony.It also feels like a very bad imitation of the much superior film Joe Vs The Volcano.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although Stiller has experienced great success with directing, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is indubitably his best work. The film is perfectly constructed and balanced with humor, action and love. Kristen Wiig and Adam Scott were perfect casting and were incredibly believable in their respective roles and it was great to see a more serious side to them both. Sean Penn, although his character was quite allusive, was brilliant as always.The story was unique, inspiring and incredibly relatable and engaging. Ben Stiller was made to play and direct Walter Mitty, and although having a unique feel to it, it's the type of film I personally love and want to see more of. The transitions alone in this film were innovatory and make the film the beautiful and artistic piece that it is. I'd highly recommend this film to anyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and banal......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely one of the most boring films I've ever seen. Stiller's mediocre acting ability isn't even worth one tenth of Danny Kaye's and this feeble attempt to remake the glorious original is an insult to the greater (and hugely funnier) actor. The Stiller character is just a geeky, annoying loser who I found difficulty finding any empathy for. There were a few genuinely funny moments in the film but mostly long periods of complete tedium. Sean Penn was wasted in a pointless cameo role and the entire storyline was implausible and lacked any real substance or depth. The female love interest wasn't even very interesting, but then, looking at Stiller's character, it's unlikely that he would be aiming high.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If not for the interesting scenery, I would have given this self-indulgent stinker one out of ten stars. Indeed, there is very little of substance to be found in this remake of the Danny Kaye classic, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.It's a shame really because the main players involved here (Stiller and Wiig) are capable of such fine work. But you can't make a likable movie without any real drama, comedy or, at the very least, mystery unless your intended audience is either underage or senile. Neither of which was the case here.However, the real shame of this movie is the vast number of extremely blatant product placements placed throughout the whole bore-fest. As such, this film just seems like a money grab for Stiller, the producers, and the movie company which owns this travesty.I strongly urge anyone who wants to see a real movie with terrific comedy, mystery and drama to check out the 1947 original Walter Mitty starring Danny Kaye and the very lovely, Virginia Mayo. You won't be disappointed with it no matter what age you are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some clever moments here and there, but it doesn't quite take off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts off pleasant enough, and for a while it shows Walter having his daydreams, which are genuinely enjoyable, I might add. The problem with this film is that it's only engaging up until Mitty begins his journey through Iceland and Greenland. And the scenes after the end of the journey. I thought his journey was a little tedious and unnecessary. Apparently the filmmakers no longer thought the daydreams were cutting it. If some of this journey was supposed to be one as well, then I must have not been paying attention. Two scenes that don't work: One in a bar, and another where Walter attempts to jump into a boat. As for the film's characters, including Walter Mitty, there's nothing special about them. Walter's female coworker (played by Kristen Wiig) doesn't serve any purpose other than to give him someone to confide in. Is she supposed to be a love interest? The only real interesting one is Ted, Walter's boss, even though he doesn't do a lot in the entire movie. While I did enjoy the chemistry between Penn and Stiller, and the way the scene plays out, the journey is just not worth the payoff. Also unnecessary: meeting the eharmony guy in person, which, I think, only exists to show us it was Patton Oswalt on the phone.**1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost inspirational, but slightly misses though still satisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are moments in this film which will stand out the most. The beginning was interesting and drew you into the story, and the ending was equally heartwarming. I also thought Ben Stiller's directorial debut showed a lot of maturity. He has an excellent eye for visuals, and often the cinematography was quite stunning.The romance developing between Ben Stiller and Kristen Wiig was well done and she played her part. The cast was good, Stiller's performance was easily his best since Greenberg and a special shout out to Adam Scott famed from Parks and Recreation, plays a horrible boss we've all had at one stage or another.Furthermore, the story is something which should be inspirational- a quiet middle aged guy with a big imagination in a rut looking for someone special, never achievied anything particularly interesting up to now or travelled. His spacing out moments hinted at opportunities missed in his life previously. Which took an interesting turn of events to convince him to take a wild journey and helped bring back his zest for life and love and conquer the day-dreaming. its a heart warming message.However, it does miss the mark at times. The 'spacing out' moments at times were decent, but often the special effects were over done and distracted from the purpose of the scene. His journey started off a little outlandish and by the end became wildly improbable including a shark attack a jaunt up the mountains of Afghanistan and offering Afghani warlords cake. At times it struggled to wrestle with whether it was a light hearted independent comedy or drama mixed with a big budger. So it settled for something uncomfortably inbetween, which detracted from what could have been powerful moments. All in all a satisfying film coupled with a nice soundtrack. But also slightly frustrating as it hinted at being a special film but settled for pretty good instead the understated love story was the highlight. I've given this a 6/10 but could also be a 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So the guy (Ben Stiller's character) has this average paying job in charge of developing negatives at a magazine for the past 16 years. He's unmarried, in his 40's with his aging mother and unemployed sister depending on his salary. The magazine called "Life" is undergoing downsizing and other major changes apparently forced onto it by nothing but the new manager, who is portrayed as the super-villain/typical suit sporting a double digit IQ. Anyways, it seems the main character, Walter Mitty (Stiller), has two main objectives. Getting the girl of his dreams who started working in his office a month ago to notice he's alive and finding the super important 25th negative sent by an ultra-adventurous super photographer employed by the magazine that doesn't ever share his whereabouts with anyone. Obviously Walter is threatened to get fired if he doesn't produce the all-important 25th negative the next time his (probably) clinically retarded douche-bag manager sees him (SPOILER: He does get fired, which results in him having to sell a piano. SPOILER2: it (the negative) is in his wallet the whole time, because the photographer-extraordinaire whom he never met in his life thought it would be a cute joke... SPOILER3: The negative is DRUMROLL - A PICTURE OF WALTER MITTY and it eventually gets published as the last ever COVER of the magazine after he goes through a ridiculous, unrealistic journey around the globe (having never traveled before) to find Sean Penn taking a picture of a snow leopard on a mountain in Afganistan! He had to use his mother's cake to bribe Afgan warlords to be allowed access to the mountain...Obviously). It is really quite incredible how people are able to convince themselves they like some piece of crap to pretend at their grasp of some sort of deeper meaning hidden within. How else could this movie get a 7.7 average rating? You can talk all you want about how we're scared to change our habits and how we need to take more risks, but there are much better movies with relatable stories and characters whereas this movie is just Ben Stiller's self-indulgence in its purest form and I regret staying to finish watching it with my wife (who regrets convincing me to stay to finish watching it) when I knew we should've left when our friends did (about half an hour into the movie) or better yet avoided it entirely, which brings me here. And so here I am now, wasting another 10 minutes of my life writing a review hoping to discourage a like-minded person or two from going to see this utter nonsense of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time to stop dreaming and start living</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller, stars and directs in this powerful and uplifting film based on the short story from James Thurber. Stiller plays Walter Mitty, a white-collared daydreamer who works as a "negative asset manager" at Life Magazine. He is responsible for collating and processing photos from freelance daring photographer Sean O'Connell.Walter escapes his anonymous life by disappearing into a world of fantasies filled with heroism, romance and action. But when Walter misplaces the 'photo of the century' and his job is threatened, he embarks on a real-world adventure more extraordinary than anything he could ever have imagined."The Secret life of Walter Mitty" is interlaced with a humour that Stiller is cast perfectly for, but you wouldn't define it as a comedy, this is an adventure tale which is well balanced between a Hollywood blockbuster and art house cinema. Accompanied by a great soundtrack including Hall &amp; Oates, David Bowie and Arcade Fire This movie will inspire and keep you warm hearted right from the beginning.The supporting cast are a little hit-and-miss, Sean Penn oozes charisma as Sean O'Connell, he only has a few lines of dialogue but they are all profound, deep and reflective. Kristen Wiig's Cheryl Melhoff is adequate as Walter's love interest but lacks chemistry and Adam Scott portrays the perfect amount of jerkiness as executive Ted Hendricks.The visual landscape is the movie's best feature. Like many other blockbusters this year including "Oblivion" and "Thor: The Dark World", much of the film is shot in Iceland and cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh's use of wide angle allows for some poetic views of the stunning panoramas, you can't help but wonder why Twentieth Century fox didn't push for a release in the larger IMAX format.The ending is predictable and even unnecessary, but "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is not about the destination, this is a story all about the journey. Whether he's jumping from helicopters, fighting sharks, climbing the Himalayas or skateboarding down erupting volcano's, Walter inspires us that it's time to stop dreaming and start living.</fullReview>

There is so much to admire about the film that you can just ignore the small imperfections left at key places. This is the best move of Ben Stiller I have watched so far. The background score is amazing, the dialog's are awesome &amp; the screenplay with the beautiful surroundings is really fabulous. Ben Stiller has rocked the movie and Sean Penn though got only 1 scene, has done complete justice to his role. Go for it, it will simply relax you in your pacey life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is without a doubt the best surprise for me in these holidays movie season. Even if it's not a major cinematic achievement in any particular way, it is incredibly confident with a clear and universal message. In time when movies always try too hard and tend to be excessive, 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' seemingly effortless delivers a timeless story to its audience. The movie is beautiful, charming and funny, yet it achieves all that without taking itself too serious. That's its real trick in my opinion.It is unfortunate the movie wasn't off to a great box office success, but I'm sure the movie will find it's audience. You probably won't find any Oscar worthy performances, but that's not always everything. From time to time we just need to be reminded how beautiful life can be, and the movie does just that brilliantly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many reviewers' sense of imagination must be really weak to find this film so good. It's the story of a mediocre man in a mediocre world whose fantasies instead of taking us to another world just depict the cliché "action" or "romance" flick he saw last year. And as drama comes in destroying his mediocre existence (consisting of his job) he finally finds that experiences out of the ordinary may be more appealing than his stereotyped mental adventures. Wow... There're some nice comedy moments and a nice photography but also some poor goofs. If poetry can still be found in some (few) Hollywood products this is definitely not the case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Your Face Product Placement Ruined What Could Have Been A Great Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, but the product placement was so blatant it ruined the illusion of the story. Let's face it, unless your making a documentary all filmmaking is based on creating good illusions, like a talented magician! When a particular fast food company that serves gross food infects a story - like a flu virus - it wrecks the fantasy created by the filmmakers! James Thurber would be spinning in his grave! Such product placement is totally unnecessary unless the producers of the film felt The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was going to be a big flop. Or, those making the film want to squeeze every last cent they can to make money by treating filmmaking like a commodity, such as toothpaste or underarm deodorant! Hey, that's a great idea, since we get to know over and over again Walter Mitty's favorite crappy fast food restaurant, why not let us know what his favorite toothpaste and underarm deodorant are, too?!! And why stop there? Let's find out his favorite type of paper towel, toilet paper, laundry detergent, car, soda, vodka, beer and on and on. I even have a new idea for a title: "The Secret Product Placement Life of Walter Mitty.I didn't pay $11.50 for a ticket and another $6.50 for popcorn to repeatedly watch and hear the characters talk about commercial products in the middle of a movie. The product placement in this film was not subtle and I didn't appreciate being forced to watch such nonsense!

		<fullReview>This movie wanders aimlessly for the first 45 minutes or so before anything happens. When the plot finally gets started it ends rather abruptly and then starts going in a different direction. It does this yet again and then seems to be over but keeps showing more scenes so that I asked my companion "why is this movie not over?" I had no idea what the point was or why things were still happening.The plot was paper thin. Find the lost negative. It never thickened or got any more complex then that. Ever. There really was no developed storyline. After about the seventh "zoned out" episode that Walter Mitty had I became very disinterested in these sideshows and just wanted them to get on with the story. If I was alone I would have walked out I was so bored, but I was with friends and family so I stayed for the whole movie.I cannot recommend this movie to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>6/2015 I adored this film. From the cast, to the plot, the scenery and the score. This film is beautiful in every way. Its uplifting, a spiritual journey for a man who needs to find himself. There are no dull moments, instead it jumps quickly from scene to scene leaving you with beautiful land and oceanic views. Sean Penn is wonderful in the role of Shawn. The use of "ground control" give the whole movie a "larger than life" feeling. This is an A++ film. Ben Stiller is wonderful! This is a comfort film. Snuggle down with snacks, a fluffy blanket and a cool breeze and just go far far away. If I were able to gush more I would. I'll just leave it at a must see and if you haven't already watched, what are you waiting for?!Update:8/2016 Still in love with this film. It's timeless. Even though I have watched Walters adventure more than a handful of times, I still go back. This movie has replaced "Hook"(W/Robin Williams) as my "sick" movie. If or when I'm not feeling good, I put on Walter, and feel loved and warm almost as soon as his first daydream. This is NOT the original movie. It feels and moves nothing like it. This movie is timeless. Much the same as the '95 Pride and Prejudice. Though others may try to imitate or even replicate this film, no one will really be able to hold the impact of Stillers version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I found some negatives....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you daydream? I think most of us do don't we? We imagine winning the lottery or going to exotic holiday destinations??. or at least I do. But Walter Mitty takes it a bit further, he zones out and imagines himself as a hero saving the day?. or saving a dog, or saving a childhood toy, or a friend performing karaoke. Not your average daydreams but very real and sometimes very exciting. He even daydreams about telling his boss off?.. now everyone does that.Walter Mitty daydreams because he is a pretty boring guy. He works for Life magazine and looks after the negatives from the battalion of photographers working for the magazine around the globe. Now before you say" "this is 2014, wouldn't all their photo's be digital? Who has negatives anymore?" let me say yes, I got stuck on that thought for a while as well. In fact, when you scratch the surface of this film you'll find there's not a lot of substance supporting very much at all. The plot is a pretty thin excuse for a two-hour film: a lost negative sends our daydreaming hero to obscure places around the world in search of the man responsible. It's worse when it's quite obvious where the supposedly "lost" object is anyway. But this is a Hollywood film and suspension of belief is after all an important reflex for enjoyment. It's not a bad film and it has a few laugh out loud moments but it's not motion picture history either.My greatest criticism for the film is it felt like one long advertisement. If you've never read Life Magazine (my aunt gave me dozens of copies years ago) then you'll be jumping on eBay to purchase an issue. If you've never tried eHarmony then you'll be getting online to find your next soul mate. If you've never tried Papa Johns pizza..... well, you see my point. The product placement and references were out of control and left me wondering was the film made for artistic value at all? Now I'm daydreaming!!! Ben Stiller as Walter is a minimalistic version of his usual self. In so many roles Stillers' fall back position is aggression or confrontation but here he dials it right down to be a guy who, through his own choices, has been boxed into his unsatisfactory life. Day dreaming is his only escape from a boring existence and Stiller the actor is more mundane than he's ever been before.Our romantic interest is played by Kristen Wiig who also compared to her usual roles is a bit of a wet rag in this one. She, like most romantic female characters, doesn't have a lot to do other than be the object of drooling affection, daydreams and the occasional tool of exposition for the audience.Whilst Walter Mitty is supposed to be the hero of this feature, the hero for me however is not he, nor is it the photographer (played by Sean Penn almost like the adult version of his character from Fast Times at Ridgemont High) but it is the cinematographer. This film shows off some of the most gorgeous views of the wonderful world we inhabit from different angles and perspectives. There are several sequences in the film which made the whole experience worthwhile; an experience with a fishing boat, skateboarding in Iceland, a volcano and a high-altitude meeting Penn are all shot beautifully and underscore the real meaning of this film.The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a reminder that there's a big beautiful world out there with interesting people, fascinating places and life changing experiences. Stop day dreaming. Go and have a look for yourself...... when you finished your Papa Johns pizza.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Any Resemblance to the Thurber Story or the Kaye Film is Purely Coincidental</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone expecting Ben Stiller to recycle the two principal intertexts for this story - the James Thurber story or the classic Danny Kaye comedy from 1947 - is likely to be highly disappointed. Superficially the plot remains the same, with Stiller playing a put-upon employee of LIFE magazine who is bullied by the new boss Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott), but eventually discovers himself as a result of a once-in-a-lifetime trip to find elusive photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn), who possesses an elusive negative needed for the final print copy of the magazine. Needless to say everything ends happily, with Mitty discovering to his delight that the photograph celebrates the work of all LIFE's employees - journalists, printers, editors, photo-staff - who made the magazine such an American institution. He also manages to convince the love of his life, Cheryl Melhoff (Kirsten Wiig) of the sincerity of his intentions. At heart, however, WALTER MITTY is a story of the importance of discovering yourself, even if the odds seem stacked against you. Walter learns to follow his inclinations, and by doing so fulfills his mother Edna's (Shirley MacLaine's) aspirations for him. Stiller gives a delightful performance, his character gradually changing from one of wide-eyed stoicism (which provokes him to daydream) into a person of quiet strength, who is not frightened of confronting Hendricks and telling the boss exactly what he thinks. At another level WALTER MITTY can be seen as an elegy for LIFE magazine, that bastion of American journalism, which has now become an online-only journal due to falling sales and changing reader preferences. The film uses archive material to show how it chronicled all the major events and personalities of the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, and how its staff (for the most part) were dedicated to their work. It's the kind of magazine that doesn't deserve to be taken over by superficial ignoramuses such as Hendricks, whose principal concern is for profitability rather than journalistic integrity.</fullReview>

Obviously breaking out of them and making some of it reality (not the ones that can not be achieved obviously, like flying or other stuff) is the ultimate goal.Ben Stiller might be known for one thing, but we can see with this movie he has a wider range. And the visual/virtual effects he uses help support his vision. A vision of a novel that I haven't read, but sounds more than intriguing even after you've watched the movie.

		<shortDescription>Ben Stiller's version of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was enjoyable enough for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I review the movie proper, let me just say that I'm familiar with both the original James Thurber short story and the Danny Kaye feature movie version. I think I remember liking both good enough but it's been awhile since I read the former or seen the latter. I did like this version starring and directed by Ben Stiller. When he's daydreaming, I managed to laugh heartily at most of them and when he's experiencing his real-life adventures, I marveled at how he's experiencing something he'll probably never do again but will now have tales to tell to future friends or family members. And Kristen Wiig does well in a more straight role that's much different from her more familiar cartoonish parts, like her recent turn in Anchorman 2, and has the same awkward vibe that matches well with Stiller's character. I also loved her singing of that David Bowie song in one of Mitty's dreams. My movie theatre-working friend thought the whole thing may have been too weird for his tastes but I liked it fine and wouldn't mind seeing it again. So on that note, I recommend this version of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ben Stiller's Labor of Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is a short story written by James Thurber way back in 1939. It was about a henpecked man who escapes into a fantasy world of danger and heroics to compensate for the depressingly dull real life he leads.Screen writer Steve Conrad adapts the title and the name and over-active imagination of the main character and tells his own original story. Ben Stiller directs and stars in this obvious "labour of love" of a movie project.Walter Mitty is a timid guy who tends to "space out" and enter into a world of his own where he is able to do wondrously heroic exploits. He would rather join an online dating service than to meet this girl Cheryl at work that he fancies. One day, he misplaced the precious negative of the photograph meant to be the cover of the last issue of Life Magazine. As his job is on the line, Walter needs to look for Sean, the globe-trotter photographer who took that missing photo. Upon deducing that Sean was in Greenland, Mitty suddenly decides to throw all caution to the wind and just go on a difficult quest, which will be the biggest adventure of his lifetime.Visually, this film is perfect with its breathtaking cinematography and unobtrusive special effects. Many scenes, particularly those showing Walter skateboarding in Iceland, or climbing the Himalayas, were very memorably shot with unique camera range and angles. The script does fall into melodrama, but I did not mind this. Ben Stiller was very good as Walter, capturing his shyness and cluelessness so sensitively. I liked Walter's moments with his mother, played by Shirley McLaine in a subdued likable manner. I also liked Walter's awkward romance with Cheryl played by Kristen Wiig, in only the second role I have seen her since "Bridesmaids." She was also very relaxed and natural here in a straight role. Too bad we do not see the full strength of her comic skills.I cannot deny that I was disappointed with how the story went. Once we reach the second half of the film when Walter actually stops having fantasies and does things for real already. I know of course that this was the point of the film, that dreams were there to be fulfilled. I just felt it somehow lost the spirit of the source short story.Overall though, this was an entertaining feel-good film that will bring us to places we rarely see on screen. The spectacular photography of the exotic settings demand that you see this film on the big screen. Despite lofty comparisons with Forrest Gump, Walter Mitty admittedly does not exactly reach those heights. However, upon watching this film, you will wonder how something so beautiful-looking could have been totally shut-out from Oscar or any other award consideration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated Dull and Boring Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The manager of negative assets sector of Life magazine Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) has been working for sixteen years in the magazine and has a tedious life without going anywhere but from his home to his job and vice-versa. He is an escapist, daydreaming into a world of fantasy many times along the day. Walter has a crush on the recently hired Cheryl Melhoff (Kristen Wiig) but he is too shy to invite her to date and he is trying to contact her through the eHarmony, a site for online dating. The magazine is preparing to release the last printed edition and the loathsome manager of transition Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott) is preparing an inevitable downsizing along the next days.Walter has been the liaison between the magazine and the mysterious independent photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) that has sent to him a package of negatives and a wallet as a gift for his work. Sean also suggests to the senior management the use of negative 25 for the cover of the last edition. However Walter cannot find the negative that is missing. Walter has no means to contact Sean and finds a clue that he might be in Greeland. He decides to travel to Greeland to track Sean down in the beginning of an unbelievable adventure. "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is an overrated dull and boring remake of the 1947 movie. The plot is silly and predictable and despite the great cast and wonderful location, it is a letdown since the comedy is not funny, the romance does not have any chemistry, the drama is inexistent and the adventure is boring and dumb. I do not believe that the hype around this movie is honest and it seems to be intentionally made to promote this weak flick.

		<shortDescription>Really Subpar but Over-hyped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie toyed around with all sorts of great themes and the problems of a modest modern sort of weak guy who retreats into his fantasy world. Yeah it is okay to attack corporate charades and downsizing practices that hurt employees more than just financially. That was a driving theme in the movie that was supposed to give it some meaning, which it did to a degree. Also the exotic location shots were a major plus, since chasing our elusive star nature photographer was the major plot device.But the rest was crap. First was all the blatant product placement. No not placement, the products and brands were built into the script. Then was the plain old out of character moments when for no reason at all, he starts fighting with airport customs security, which required the intervention of a brand name rep guy.basically, our Walter Mitty, which Ben Stiller was suitably cast as, had to find this all important picture from his roving camera man. The photographer was Sean Penn, for whom our Walter developed and processed his film but the two never met, though they worked together for a long time. So Ben/Walter has to go on this globe trotting expedition to find the camera man and get his film. Walt's bosses are sitting on pins and needles waiting for it.That is all you really need to know about the plot element. But the conclusion will send you into hysterics. See this camera man, who never actually bothered to visit our nebbish protagonist, actually really admired Walter. So much that the final shot all of Life was waiting for was Walter sitting by himself at lunch outside. This he told Walt when Walt finally caught up with him in Nepal. Then we find out this wonderfully famous photographer, while never deigned to meet his unsung hero Walt, did visit Walt's mom. So Walt gets terminated in the end, But the whole time, I am thinking, why didn't the Mr Wonderful Hero Photographer tell the suits at Life to not only keep Walt on, but give him a promotion? A totally Hollywood movie deserves a totally Hollywood ending! Or an ending with some grand unexpected twist, like Mitty was some bind, torture and kill serial murderer on the side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I LOVE the depth of this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is so smart that it's scary. I love the images that are embedded throughout the film. Every detail of the set, color, and lighting are geared toward contributing to the theme of living life to its fullest by seeing clearly who you are and what is around you. Ben Stiller was the perfect choice for Walter Mitty. And Sean Penn is fantastic in his role of the adventurous, but mysterious, photographer.The movie is not meant to be an exact replication of the short story in which it's based; it goes much further to convey it's theme to viewers. This film is a must-see. In fact, see it twice--you will notice many details upon the second viewing which contribute to this film. Simply amazing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a busy world, Walter Mitty is our spirit animal (****)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It might be difficult for choosy audiences with cynical dispositions, but if we can look past the pesky product placement in "The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty", we're left with one very, very good film. Ben Stiller, who usually seems to have little clue how to use his specific talents, gives his best performance to date in front of and behind the camera. This is a film that may not resemble the source material verbatim, but the spirit is clearly alive, with a few touches to modernize the idea. As a whole, it's a sweet, confident, and poignant film that has a lot to say, but I think it speaks only to those willing to listen.Walter Mitty (Stiller) is a negative asset manager for Life magazine- basically, his is the department responsible for bringing in and processing the film from the field that will go into the magazine (and by his 'department', I mean Walter and his assistant (Martinez) ). In essence, in the time Walter has worked at the publication, the very soul of the magazine has been processed on his watch. It's prescient, that his seemingly simple position holds so much sway, but we'll return to that idea.His problem, it seems, is that he daydreams. Mind you, this isn't the type of absent-mindedness that you or I take part in. Walter misses large chunks of actual time in his fantasy land, jolted back to reality by silence, love interests, or transition managers. In his escapes, Walter is well-traveled and mysterious, interesting and not invisible to others. He's confident and allowed to pursue that which he wants. In other words, he's the full version of himself. I like how this film pulls back the comedic reigns here- Stiller too often becomes, well, Stiller, and overdoses on the comedy. Here, the humor is subtle and fits the tone of the film. It also doesn't pander, or make us feel sorry for Walter. There's a very good reason his life is the way it is, and again, it's presented without pretense.I mentioned a transition manager, profiled in full douchebag by Adam Scott. Well, the print version of Life is going under in this film, and switching to an online format. Positions like Walter's are likely to be eliminated, as well as accounting spots like the one Cheryl (Wiig) holds down. However, before the end, they want to send up one last issue, and long-time contributor Sean O'Connell (Penn), who has sent a roll of film containing an image he specifically wants to become the last cover. The problem is that Walter has either misplaced it, or it was lost along the way. This causes him to seek it out, thus finally spurring him to make his fantasies become, well, realities.I think a good portion of society can identify with an individual that finally lets loose a bit, that allows himself, finally, the adventure he deserves. A lesser film would make these emotional breakthroughs farcical, ala "Last Holiday", but this is subtle and decent. That's why the big reveal of what that last cover image is a fantastic moment. I believed in this Walter Mitty as a hard- working guy who missed out on life thus far due to some bad luck. It was wonderfully refreshing to see a character, despite his quirks, find happiness in the midst of just being, well, a good guy.I caution those looking simply for a pandering, feel-good story around the holidays. That's not what this is. Instead, Stiller and crew have taken the spirit of the source material and adapted it to our world. Granted, there are a few goofs- for example, Walter seems keen on good rock music and skateboard culture, but he isn't aware of a popular David Bowie song? Also, how does one get a clementine cake, sweet as it may be, through customs? Those things don't doom the film, but I do feel it's another reason this will divide people- those that claim this has nothing to offer but cynical product placement messages, and those like myself that sense a broader theme of becoming who we want to be, and understanding where we lose our way. That's a powerful thought, and this quietly beautiful film has the sense to not beat us over the head with it. After all, the film does tell us that "beautiful things don't ask for attention". That's certainly a statement that a number of filmmakers could stand to hear more often.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Stiller is a master of acting through reacting. This kind of role, where he is the straight-laced guy forced reluctantly out of his comfort zone into action, is the one he is made to play. As Walter Mitty, a man with no words to complete the 'been there, done that' field of his online dating profile, he gives a touching, genuine performance of a man who learns to enjoy life, and gets what he wants by doing what he fears. The trailer is full of the CGI explosions, helicopter jumps and shark attacks. But this film works best in its low-key moments: Walter's awkward exchanges with Cheryl, his chiding of Sean's haphazard handling of #25. There is a funny, lovely hug with a colleague in an elevator. And the final shot of this film, revealing a photo that I thought we were destined never to see, is truly moving, a quiet, powerful moment all too rare in cinema. The script has heart and resists the temptation to go for easy pastiche. A simple tale, well told, and honest in its appeal and payoff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pleasant Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had serious reservations about 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty'. I love the Thurber short story, and Danny Kaye's gloriously disloyal 1947 rendering of the tale on the big screen in equal measure - but find Ben Stiller too mannered a comic actor, in recent years, to be watchable. Too many trademark ticks and tricks in his emotional repertoire. While largely disregarding Thurber (and Kaye, though there a number of enjoyably OTT fantasy sequences - only one of which, a hokey Benjamin Button skit, seems redundant), I have to say that I was greatly impressed by this film. It is, in point of fact, one of the most beautiful pieces of cinema I've seen in a long time - the audience, like Mitty, discovering the glories of the world outside his glum, humdrum existence, a world he'd only witnessed in miniature, vicariously - and the landscapes of Greenland, Iceland and even New York are quite gloriously rendered (kudos to DP Stuart Dryburgh). Stiller's direction is confident, and the performances - including his own - are measured, restrained and all the more effective and affecting for that. I hate the term, but this is, at heart, a 'Feel-good' movie - and a thoughtful one, at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute new take on the James Thurber classic, see it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) has a secret life in his daydreams. When he wants to kiss the girl or take a swing at his boss, he can do it in a pretend world that is very realistic. Most times, someone has to say something to bring him back to earth. As an employee of the photography department of Life Magazine, he is very respected. But, his world is turned over when a beautiful divorcée, Cheryl (Kristen Wiig) joins the staff. How to approach her is his burning question. At first, he joins a matchmaking site and tries to "wink" at her profile. She doesn't wink back. But, when a new owner arrives at the magazine and starts throwing his weight around, Walter and Cheryl have a bond. The two become worried that they will be let go. This is especially true when a valuable negative turns up missing and Walt will take the blame if its not found. Believing it is with a world traveling photographer, Walter breaks away from his comfort zone and jets to Greenland and Iceland to catch up with the shutterbug. Will he make it home? Will our dear Walter also win the day with Cheryl? If you have never read the Thurber story on which this film is based, do it now. Even so, this new take on the tale is cute, funny, and worthwhile without that foundation. Especially fine is the cast and the breathtaking scenery in far away climes. Yet, the script, costumes, and direction are wonderful as well. Secretly slip out the door and surprise your family with this fine little flick.</fullReview>

I related to this so much; it had so much depth and realism that it was pure, unadulterated joy to watch.Maybe it was that I wasn't expecting much or that I had something incredibly different pictured in my head but, whatever it was, it floored me completely.For me, this film was a perfect blend of action, adventure, comedy, and romance, with a dash of slice-of-life to boot and make the concoction its own thing. I would gladly have it over and over again.And do not get me started on the music and the visuals; absolutely sublime.

		<fullReview>Review:When I went to the cinema to see The Secret Life of Walter Mitty last December, I honestly did not have very high expectations. I had not heard much about the film, and what had intrigued me to see it was not a recommendation from a friend. I had simply seen the preview, and it struck me as something maybe worth watching. After viewing the movie, however, my opinion was completely different. I was so pumped as I walked out of the theater, excited about how much adventure I had just vicariously lived through the character of Walter Mitty in the last 114 minutes of me merely sitting in front of the screen, and ever since, I have been dying to go explore Iceland and possibly learn how to ride a skateboard just so I can ride down one of its incredibly scenic, absolutely breathtaking mountain roads. What really made the movie for me, though, was the incredible soundtrack which was super appropriate and very unique. A review published online by KCRW, a public radio station based in Santa Monica, CA, put it this way, "The overall effect is that of quiet otherworldliness, which likely will suit the flights of imagination depicted in the film" (Lawrence). The mix brings in a variety of eclectic rhythms from well-known artists such as Jack Johnson and Of Monsters &amp; Men to the not so familiar Junip and Rogue Wave. The songs really suit the dreamy, melancholy tone of the film (Scott). Each artist brings a distinct style that really works well with the flow of the movie, and several of the tracks are classic oldies remade which also add to the unique vibe of the film. Another aspect of the movie that goes hand in hand with the soundtrack is the colors used. At the beginning of the movie, a lot of the music is slow, reflective, and mainly instrumental, and the color scheme goes well with that. Up until Walter decides to be brave enough to travel across the ocean in search of negative 25, the colors are mainly greys, light blues, and blacks. This adds to the sort of dull, stiff, and quite helpless view of Walter we have when the movie starts out. By the time he decides to hop on a plane to Greenland, however, more vibrant colors begin to be introduced, and more upbeat and lively music begins to play. Once the picturesque scenes of the Greenland and Iceland landscapes are start becoming a prevalent part of the movie, the colors are wide-ranging and absolutely stunning along with the music which becomes more and more inspiring as the movie progresses. The progression from duller music and colors to livelier more vibrant hues and songs really depicts Walter's personal progression in the movie as he transitions from an uninteresting person with a wild imagination to a man who gains courage and, as a result, has extraordinary experiences. A lot of the cohesiveness between the various aspects of the movie such as colors, music, and message, I believe is largely due to the fact that Ben Stiller, who portrays the main character in the film, also directed it and picked out the music selections that the soundtrack would consist of. Another facet of cohesiveness in the film is the presence of the proverbial theme song that audiences interact with most throughout the film, David Bowie's "Space Oddity." The song is referenced multiple times by different characters. Initially, the bearded and very well dressed jerk, who is the manager of the Life Magazine's transition to an online only publication, intends to poke fun at Walter by nicknaming him "Major Tom" (the main character of Bowie's song) and repeats the lyrics to Bowie's song, "Can you hear me Major Tom?" as he immaturely throws a paperclip at him to see if he would snap out of the daydream he was having at the time (Bowie). However, later on in the film, Cheryl Melhoff, Walter's secret crush, tells him that the song is inspiring because it is about exploration and stepping into the unfamiliar and experiencing life outside of one's comfort zone. When Walter later on makes a pretty important yet risky decision, he imagines Cheryl singing the song to him, and that is what ultimately motivates him to be bold. The part of the song playing as he jumps on the helicopter with a very drunk pilot says, "I'm stepping through the door." This line in particular speaks of a shift much like the one Walter Mitty experiences throughout the film. "Space Oddity" along with the rest of the soundtrack is really a big part of what make the film a success in my mind and really does a good job of propelling the movie forward. Quite frankly, the soundtrack is phenomenal standing alone as well. I listen to it on a frequent basis, especially when I want to feel inspired.Works Cited:Bowie, David. "Space Oddity."

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good, yet too trapped in Hollywood conventions (and product placement) to be great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't heard much good about this movie and wasn't planning to watch it, but then my girlfriend saw it on a plane and said it was great, so I decided to check it out. It is a much better movie than I'd been lead to expect, a thoughtful movie with a nuanced performance by Ben Stiller as someone who has settled into a rut and spends his time dreaming of the adventurous life he'd like to be living. There are fun fantasy sequences, an engaging story, and a lot of nice scenery, and overall I enjoyed this movie, which is funny and heartfelt.*** SPOILERS BELOW ***That being said, I felt the movie could have been a little braver. There was a moment, when Mitty is climbing the mountain and all that, when I thought, maybe this movie won't do the Hollywood thing. Maybe Mitty will realize that by taking control of his life, he can move beyond his obsession with the cute co-worker. That she, nice as she was, was nothing but another fantasy. I would have liked to see him start fresh. It's the sort of thing that could happen in a European film, but not in a mainstream American one. To me, this cheapens a tale of self discovery; was it all just to get some girl?I also felt that sometimes the movie was a little too in love with itself, as in the getting-on-the-helicopter scene, which seems to go on *forever*. But then, someone else who reviewed the movie here specifically mentioned that as one of the best scenes in the film, so I guess some people consider it a soaring moment rather than a point hammered into the ground.I could have also done without the sometimes relentless product placement. It's not so much an objection to seeing products in movies as to how perfectly framed they are in a way that just screams out, "THIS IS AN AD." Can't these things just be off to the side in a less obvious manner? I'm sure the corporations demand this sort of prominence, but it's hugely distracting to me.Still, it was enjoyable and I'm glad I watched it. I just wish it had been a little braver and a little less pat and predictable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film proved popular with critics and audiences in Europe, who in general are much more well-versed in irony and cinematic craftsmanship than American audiences. If you are unable to comprehend the ironic use of product placement, as in the use of Papa John's Pizza to recall Stiller's dead father, then the rest of the film will have little relevance.It is certainly a thoughtful and nostalgic piece, reflecting upon the smoldering cynicism of corporate media, and its ultimate inability to stimulate the minds of an increasingly numb citizenry. Just read the one and two star reviews of this film and Stiller's point becomes painfully evident.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really fine movie, Stiller and Wiig in non-comedic roles.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a big Ben Stiller fan, but I DO enjoy many of his movies. With that as background, I went into watching this one with a bit of apprehension, but overall I found this to be one of the better movies I have seen recently. And I see about 250 a year.The story here is based on LIFE magazine, known since the 1800s as a weekly magazine with an emphasis on photojournalism. Many of the covers are iconic. It ceased to be a weekly in 1972, and has been published in various forms since then. Now we are seeing the days leading up to its final cover, the magazine going solely on-line.Ben Stiller is mild-mannered Walter Mitty, based on James Thurber's 1939 short story, "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty", about a man who had a very vivid fantasy life. In this movie he is turning 42 as a new manager comes in to see that the operation of publishing LIFE magazine gets shut down orderly and people are fired. But Mitty is the manager of "negative assets", the man who for years has received, examined, and cataloged photo negatives that come in, including those chosen for the covers.Walter is single and lonely and joins an online matchmaking service, and he has his eye on pretty and sweet Kristen Wiig as new LIFE employee, Cheryl Melhoff. (Her character's name is a tribute to Walter Mithoff, the real person that inspired Thurber to name his Mitty character.) But he has an ongoing difficulty getting things going.Another key character is played by Sean Penn as a famous but very elusive professional photographer. He sends some negatives and tells that "negative 25" is an iconic image and it should be used for the last LIFE cover. But when Walter examines all the images, frame #25 is missing. That prompts him to set out to find the photographer and ultimately image #25. This leads him to such places as Greenland, Iceland, and the Himalayas. One of the things that makes this movie so enjoyable, and my wife echoed this sentiment, Stiller and Wiig do not play comedic characters, their roles are serious but sweet. So the whole movie has many humorous parts in it, but done in a very entertaining way. Also directed by Ben Stiller.SPOILERS: So Walter Mitty gets to live out adventures that perhaps are even better than his fantasy life, and in the end he does get the girl. When he finds the photographer, in the Himalayas, he tells Walter the image was inside the inscribed wallet he gave Walter. It had been thrown into mom's (Shirley MacLaine) garbage in frustration but she retrieved it. Inside was the negative, which became the image for the final issue. It was a photo of Walter himself sitting outside the TIME building, looking at a contact sheet of negatives, doing his job for the magazine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Stiller directs and stars in THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY, James Thurber's classic story of a day-dreamer who escapes his anonymous life by disappearing into a world of fantasies filled with heroism, romance and action. When his job along with that of his co-worker (Kristen Wiig) are threatened, Walter takes action in the real world embarking on a global journey that turns into an adventure more extraordinary than anything he could have ever imagined. Watching this movie, there was a smile on my face the whole time. I wanted to drop everything off and go out on an adventure just like Mitty did. And that is right. Sometimes you do have to take the leap. There is so much beauty in this world waiting for you to notice it. Just like John Green mentioned in TFIOS: "The Universe wants to be noticed." This is exactly what I felt and understood while watching this film. In a way we are all like Mitty: we imagine so many things, keep daydreaming about how we are going to face every obstacle in our lives with some super hero strength but in reality, we are afraid. We are oh so afraid to do what our heart tells us. But we have to take chances in order to live. I should be reviewing this movie about how perfectly Ben Stiller did his role, how beautiful the landscape was, how the special effects were spot-on. These all things were there and surely played a major role but the message this movie contains is far too important than any of these things, Hence; my totally philosophical rant above. I just saw this movie and I think it deserved a freaking Oscar. It was that awesome. Nevertheless, this quote from the movie justifies the cruelty of Oscars: -"Beautiful things don't ask for attention." It will always be a thought-provoking and a really really beautiful movie for me. And those of you who have good taste in movies will definitely love it too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) is about to lose his job as he cannot find negative 25 showing ,we think, Adventurer/Photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) which would go on the very last cover of Life Magazine. Life Mag is being bought out by another company. What to do? What to do?Before I watched the movie I had these thoughts: Do you daydream? Of course you do. We all do. Do you ever do anything about your daydreams? Probably not. Take heart, Walter Mitty does something about his daydreams. You are in luck. You can live vicariously thru Walter Mitty in this movie. Lucky you. Okay, maybe I daydreamed a bit. And, then I watched the movie and discovered you were not so lucky after all. Sorry. There was no secret life of Walter Mitty. James Thurber is spinning uncontrollably in his grave. We see a few daydreams in the beginning and think this will continue. Sadly no. No time for daydreaming, as he is in the real world and must find the missing negative and he goes off looking for Sean O'Connell in Greenland, Iceland, Afghanistan and the Himalayas. Not sure if the movie was actually shot in these locations or if a Green Screen was used. But, the scenery landscapes were captivating, awesome, and very beautiful. And, his dip into the sea with a shark nearby was pretty good too. What didn't work: The Benjamin Button scene, the drunk helicopter pilot karaoke scenes, the chemistry with Cheryl (Kristen Wiig) and Safe - too safe - dialogues.What would have helped? Traveling or some-such music when Walter goes here and there. Didn't happen. And, a better script with some funny and clever lines too. And, also another movie title as this one is grossly misleading. Normally, when we see a Ben Stiller movie we look forward to his looking like a deer in the headlights.. That's his shtick. It is quite humorous.. Didn't happen. However, we do see a lot Stiller close-ups (but no deer look) of his face - perhaps too many - but he was also the Director and he can do that if he wants. The movie is all monotone, slow and just another slice of life not going anywhere. The supporting cast were all good and Shirley McLaine as Walter's mother makes a short appearance. We did enjoy Sean Penn as he is always good. At the end we get to see the last cover of Life Magazine. And, it will shock you, make you weepy as you reach for the Kleenex box you didn't think you needed. That picture was the only good thing about this movie. It is pure gold. The problem was that we had to go thru everything lame first. Bummer. (5/10)Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is the story of Walter Mitty(Ben Stiller), who is a daydreamer. Mitty has these surreal daydreams where he does many heroic things &amp; gets together with his office colleague, Cheryl Melhoff(Kristen Wiig), who he has a major crush on. When his job &amp; the job of his colleagues is threatened, Walter Mitty goes on the adventure of a lifetime, where everything he dreams about comes true. Ben Stiller shines in his directorial debut. One of the highlights of the film are the locations. Be it Greenland, Iceland, the Himalayas, or even America, all the locales have been captured beautifully. The special effects are mind blowing. Ben Stiller is brilliant as Walter Mitty. Stiller makes his character adorable &amp; hilarious at the same time. The scenes in which Mitty 'zones out' are some of the funniest scenes in the film. However, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is not just a comedy. It is also an emotional journey of a man who starts out as just a dreamer but, overcomes his fears &amp; actually does something. Kristen Wiig is spectacular as Cheryl Melhoff. Adam Scott is hilarious as Walter's mean boss, Ted Hendricks. Kathryn Hahn is great as Walter's sister, Odessa Mitty. Shirley MacLaine is amazing as Walter's mother, Edna Mitty. Sean Penn is outstanding in his cameo as Walter's inspiration, Sean O'Connell. I would like to conclude by saying, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a must watch, for the dreamer in all of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty is an imitation of a heart, but not a cold one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the first trailer of The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty hit the internet, we were in awe. Set to an Of Monsters and Men song that immediately grew on all of us and without giving anything away, it hinted at a cathartic epic that would make us feel creative and free. As a young writer and daydreamer, I loved the idea of incorporating casual fantasies into a script and was very excited to see how it was done in a major picture. It's a shame that this highlight reel was the limit of Mitty's allure. After an over-saturation of marketing, the mystery faded and few were left still intrigued. During that short period of hype, I decided to read the screenplay and it was a huge mistake. Thank god, it was not the draft they shot. I don't even know who would write the draft I read. I loved Steve Conrad's The Weather Man but The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty was terrible, both in how it was written and what was written. It was a rambling mess. I really hoped they changed it but reviews had me concerned.Fortunately, Ben Stiller tightened up the script a lot and although it kept the main storyline and twists, it moves a lot smoother. I have a soft spot for Stiller. He was one of my favourite actors when I first started to get into films. If it wasn't for him, I would've never watched The Royal Tenenbaums and began my Wes Anderson obsession. He's not perfect, but I like his style. Zoolander is great fun, if extremely silly and dated now. Tropic Thunder has its moments, but it's way too bloated. Even though he's exploring something a bit more light and twee, Mitty also had the danger of being bloated but Stiller was able to keep control and let it flow more intimately. Unfortunately, although he's growing in confidence as a director, his presence as the star may the film's biggest downside. We're simply too familiar with him. He isn't believable in his timidness and his moments of growth feel forced. We have a supposedly untraveled introverted character, but we already have many stock images of Ben Stiller in extravagant landscapes in our heads. His Walter Mitty adventure isn't anything special and that affects the film severely. Perhaps this could've improved if he swapped roles with Parks and Recreation's Adam Scott. I know he's talented, but he was simply awful as Walter's boss, a role that Stiller could have just don the White Goodman beard and rule again with a much better sense of humour. But then, would Scott have been believable climbing mountains and evading shark attacks? I don't know. But it would've felt better to watch. He's more of an underdog type. On the other hand, Kristen Wiig, who seems to be in everything these days was pleasantly charming in a role that she could've easily overdone. In Walter Mitty's first forty minutes, it is yet again a victim of its marketing. In its most confident and entertaining sequences, you can't help but shake off the feeling that we've seen this setup again and again condensed into its several two minute trailers with only a few scenes added. It's difficult to invest in his journey with that much familiarisation. The initial fantasy scenes are hit and miss, some fun, some plain weird. The problem is that the 'real world' of Mitty is a different planet to ours so his fantasies aren't as distinct as they could be and pop culture references feel strange and out of place.However, if Walter Mitty is assured in anything, its the aesthetic. That's what everyone talked about when that trailer hit, it was all about the cinematography. Now, it's certainly an improvement on Stiller's other films but it comes with its problems. Too often the frame feels too wide. It makes the characters too grand rather than capturing isolation. They don't feel like ordinary people doing extraordinary things, these are movie stars and it takes us out of the fiction. But the film still has its wistful charm with its palette of blues and beiges and its wonderful score. Although sometimes its quirky humour doesn't fit the pacing, it can have a sharp wit, particularly provided by Patton Oswalt's sole in-person scene. It's a film that makes you feel good in shards but it's as mildly irritating as it is mildly entertaining. I'm just relieved that Stiller fixed the script so significantly. The buildup works but it loses points on the weak payoff. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty will work for some who remain believers and even if we could criticise who Stiller is to tell us these messages of how to live our lives when he can clearly afford such luxury. But then who can deny a bit of well-meaning cheerful optimism? 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Stiller made the best out of every tool he had for this film. There are multiple times during the film where I dreaded that it would take an easy way out, and it did not, the pace build perfectly, it's cohesive and to top it off the cinematography, the soundtrack and the motivations are spectacular. While the "bad guys" are a bit of a caricature, the presence of each character gives the story focus, and great sense of direction.It's entertaining and compelling, and it handles the story outcomes beautifully.Go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say, Ben Stiller makes one of his best roles on this movie about a man in his middle age who has the ability to dream away from his reality when it might not be the most perfect time for it.The Movie mixes drama with comedy in a very good way and there's a lot of really funny scenes that I laughed my way through.The movie is very nice and it has a lot of beautiful pictures and environments that you wish you would see for yourself in real life and with a message that appeals to me personally and tells me that I have to wake up and do something major in my life.I really liked this movie and it's on the top 10 of my favorite movies from 2013.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of 2013's best films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than other films, "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" fractures the audience. Split along the dividing line between cynicism and idealism, one camp finds a sweet treat celebrating the underdog while the other chokes on treacle.Armed with a terrific script penned by Steven Conrad, star and Director Ben Stiller proves his mettle in front of and behind the camera. His Mitty is an everyman sacrificing all for family; the flights of fancy an escape from a life lived in quiet desperation. Set upon a quest to find an important film negative, Mitty surpasses fantasy, finds the negative and wins the girl. It's pure hokum, yet surprisingly uplifting. Risking oxymoron, though steeped in fantasy "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is unerringly real.The film also peddles the notion our increasingly wired world, where it's not real unless posted on Facebook, is fallacious and dangerous in that human connection to the world and each other is becoming the fantasy. Think of sightseers sequestered behind iPads and smart phones snapping away in lieu of directly experiencing the marvels before them. Or the story of a man beaten by several others on a subway platform where none of the bystanders stepped up or called 911 but did record the scene on their mobile devices.Best expressed by the object of Mitty's search, photographer Sean O'Connell (a fine Sean Penn) is poised to take a spectacular snap of the elusive Snow Leopard, balks and states (paraphrasing), "Sometimes I don't take it. I just like to be in the moment." A concept drowning in contemporary life built on instantaneous gratification. (The difference between the immediacy of digital photography and traditional which requires time, patience and a swim in smelly, carefully prepared chemicals.)"To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life." This cinematic "Life" magazine motto - the film's theme - infers the adventurous spirit, curiosity and purposefulness require resuscitation. Absent the phony, wise guy RomCom dialogue used in most of the ilk, "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," quietly celebrates the human spirit like no other film in recent memory. And there is nary a cynical frame in it.Kristen Wiig is understated and quite appealing. In an unforgettable scene, Walter fantasizes she takes the stage in Nuuk, Greenland to dedicate a rendition of Bowie's "Space Oddity" to him. The ballad rouses Walter to board a helicopter and, hanging on for dear life, continue the quest. Later, while pedaling in hot pursuit of Sean O'Connell, a large flock of birds creates Wiig's likeness. It's an amazing image (as is the cinematography of Iceland and British Columbia).Adam Scott's corporate raider is a bit broad and one dimensional. Shirley MacLaine is fine as Edna Mitty; a sweet, pie-baking Mom direct from the cover of "The Saturday Evening Post."If fault is to be found it is in overt product placement that is counter to the film's tone. In defense, the Papa Johns tie-in is motivated unlike Fedex trucks prowling streets in many films. But the inclusion of Patton Oswalt as an E-Harmony rep is an unnecessary distraction.Not unlike any other romantic comedy, this is a film of standard movie plot points and complications. "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" soars in its heartfelt, assured and gentle execution. Given its definitive slant, your mileage may vary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well made, funny and uplifting movie that teaches us the following: It is never too late to go out, see the world and be adventurous. You will also be surprised to see what kind of great customer service eHarmony is offering :) There is no negative to say about the movie. Maybe the one daydreaming scene with the Benjamin Button reference is a bit too weird but on the other hand ? that is more the typical Ben Stiller humor. Also to mention is the soundtrack with fantastic songs from Jose Gonzales. The music fits the many great nature scenes from Greenland, Island and Afghanistan and makes the movie a pleasure to watch on the big screen. You will feel happier and start making plans for your next travel as soon as you leave the cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>December is when big movies come out. 2013's December was no different. The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug and Anchorman 2 were destined to be blockbusters based on the success of the first film's in those franchises. American Hustle, a David O'Russell film that featured Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence (who he had success with in 2012's Silver Linings Playbook) as well as Amy Adams and Christian Bale, was released in the month, as well as Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street, which featured fan favorites Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill. Critically acclaimed Disney's Frozen was also still attracting viewers in December. With all of these movies, and others that were not even mentioned, there was another great film released in the month: The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. I read the short story in middle school and saw the vague, yet intriguing, trailer, which feature Of Monsters and Men, over the summer. I almost didn't make time to see Mitty because of the hectic activities of the holidays, work and other movies but I ended up having a free night and watched it. I am so glad I did not pass it up. Ben Stiller is best in his serious roles and Mitty is a surprisingly serious film. Wiig, who also starred in Anchorman 2 last month, also acts surprisingly well in a fairly minor role. The film focuses mainly on the idea of really living your life and by the end of the film the viewer should want to make their own life more active. Truly delightful and perhaps Stiller's second best performance of his career (the first being The Royal Tenenbauns).Let's hope this film was not lost because of the films it was released alongside with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember a few weeks ago how disappointed I was after seeing "Saving Mr. Banks"? I warned you all not to take your children - and without spoiling the movie - told you it is not all mice and princesses - this Disney movie? It was not a feel good movie AT ALL. So imagine my JOY when - halfway through - I realized Walter Mitty WAS a GREAT movie - and I actually felt good when I left. No depression. No worries. No tears! For The Win!!! I have always been an optimist, a big time dreamer. There have been many times in my life people have looked at me like I am INSANE for "trying this" or "going there". I recently saw a Cary Grant quote that resonated big time with me: For example, I always wanted to be around actors and film making, and I am a movie junkie (obviously). I love movies because of what is going on that the viewer never sees. I love the imaginations that bring these stories to life. So I spent 40+ years on the outside looking in - until I decided to start making things happen. Yes, I know..Turbine wasn't even in theaters, but I got to be involved - and that was a BUCKET LIST moment and I was TERRIFIED and no one can ever take it away from me. Yes, I know - it's only a small broadcast station in Missouri - but I still work there. Yes I know, I just sell TV ads for my real job - but I still get to work with talented artists who help bring dreams to life. Yes I know, I am not a "real movie critic", but I still get invited to screenings, I have interviewed two actors and have my first author interview later this month. Yes I know my review segment on TV is less than five minutes long, but I still get to talk about the movies that I love EVERY SINGLE WEEK on television. So go ahead - sit in the stands if that is what makes you happy, but some of us like to get in the game. Some of us don't care what others think - we have been the "have nots" our entire lives and that is what makes us "artsy nerds" the fairest of them all. END OF SCENE....moving on to my review...lol Walter Mitty gives us all a chance to be dreamers; with every step he takes we can drift off into our own sea of dreams, and wonder quietly - would I? could I? - if given the chance? Too many people live their lives with "Ifs and Buts" and poke fun of those of us who are dreamers.There were so many things I loved about this movie, too many to mention really - mostly I loved the "Do You know ANYONE in Los Angeles moment?" That was my favorite.No wait, I also loved the big "Cover Reveal" of the LIFE magazine- I loved the way Sean got so close to Mitty but never met him in person - his purpose was profound.Or was it the physical transformation of Mitty that I didn't notice until the very moment Cheryl notices? Because I really loved that moment too..I loved the casting of Sean Penn - perfect for the part. One of the greatest lines in the movie: "Beautiful things don't ask for attention" ~ Sean O'Connell I saw this movie on Christmas Day, which is a pretty risky move. It was a risk well worth taking. This was one beautiful little movie. And this chick highly recommends!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my younger years when I was a veracious reader I stumbled upon The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and absolutely loved it. I have never seen the original film (though I plan to soon) and I wasn't too concerned whether or not this film would follow the story closely (which it doesn't.) Anyone looking for an adaptation of the original short story...just cancel it right out of your mind because this isn't it. This is more of a remake of the original film that holds some of the character, morals and ideas of the short story. From the moment I saw the trailer I was excited. I saw this as potentially another Forrest Gump (one of the greatest films ever made in my book.) In many ways it absolutely has some of that great style and feel that made Forrest Gump great and that is a huge compliment. My expectations for this were quite high and I left the theatre not disappointed at all. It was absolutely a feel good film that had many things to ponder about life and risk. It was definitely a comedy with some decent laughs but had a lot of heart as well. Was it perfect? No. It starts out a little slow and some of the imagination scenes felt just a little bit forced but one thing is for certain the stunning, jaw dropping scenery and cinematography in this film is a ten easy. Its simply beautiful to watch.Ben Stiller takes double duty as director and star and bravo to him on both counts. I like Stiller but especially when he does stuff like this and leaves the stupid Zoolander type characters and comedy at home. This was the perfect role for him as the assuming, quiet Walter Mitty who opens himself up to the world for the first time. He is terrific on screen and he outdoes himself as director so kudos to him. Kristen Wiig is good if not just a little understated as the object of Mitty's affections. However, this is a great role for her compared to the stupid SNL type comedy she's done in recent years. She is actually a very good serious actor and her and Stiller have great chemistry. Her character is just a little bit underdeveloped and doesn't get enough scenes to truly shine but she does well. Sean Penn (someone I have a love hate relationship with because he often picks incredible movies but I find him pompous and irritating) has a small appropriate and well done role as photographer and adventurer Sean O'Connell. He is actually the perfect fit for the mostly mysterious role and is quite good in it. Probably one of the best roles he's had in some time. The supporting cast are all good...though no one is really great. Shirley Maclaine should have been better and perhaps worked into the story more as Mitty's Mom and Adam Scott was perfectly pompous and evil as Mitty's new boss and they had great chemistry against each other.Despite the story's minor short comings it is a beautiful film and one for nearly everyone. I can't tell you enough how stunning the scenery is from Greenland to Iceland and even the streets of New York City are just perfectly used and each scene has something to look at from the dark shadows of Mitty's office to the towers Afghan mountains. When I see this again on video (which I certainly will!) I have a feeling it will lose just a little something not seeing it on the big screen because there is a distinctive jaw dropping quality about some of the scenes (him skateboarding through the countryside, the mountain climbing and so much more.) I actually found the imagination scenes almost too distracting but it was necessary to demonstrate Mitty's desire to escape. This didn't really have to be Walter Mitty...they could have made it a whole new concept but that's hindsight now and it is what it is. The film is actually a lot funnier than what I expected but they don't let the comedy interfere with the true heart behind this story. An absolutely worthy entertaining film that you should see!! 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not remade, but well made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main reason I went to see this film was my love for the first Secret Life of Walter Mitty. I already knew from all the teasers and previews that this was going to be something completely different, but I had to see what happened to Walter in this incarnation. I can say that in my opinion though the mutual literary source is evident, this one is really a completely different movie, with no intention of being a remake. Which is probably the best decision they could've made. Ben Stiller, is no Danny Kaye, and had he tried to be, I can only imagine the catastrophe it would've been. As is, he strike a perfect balance between the real dreary life and almost dreary character into which Walter's life has turned him. And the ragged adventurer hidden inside him. He manages to show the would be "loser", the fantastic day dreamer and the "adernalin junkie", and show them as one real person never making him heroic or super when the adventure is real, and even managing an ending that wouldn't be a typical Hollywood one, in the best way. The supporting cast is very good, the cinematography is practically superb. The inter-film jokes work nicely, and a sharp barb or two are being sent at the modern success driven internet age and the society we live in - making me all the happier. My actual rating is 8.5, but the stars system won't allow me to grade it thusly so I had to say it here.In a single line - it's a real life fantastic comedy - go see it and you'll understand what I'm speaking about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Not-so-secretive Life of Walter Mitty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is nothing secretive about the life of Ben Stiller's Walter Mitty. Nothing extraordinary or even remotely interesting about it, yet here we are.The film adds nothing to the genre, in fact Ben Stiller uses all the oh-so-familiar cookie-cutter techniques. It is plagued by comically one dimensional characters like the despicable boss, harassed protagonist looking for redemption, female love interest who adds nothing to the narrative; even Sean Penn appears in a self-parodying cameo as the brooding, I'm-so-much-deeper-than-you Sean O'Connell. Add to this the contrived plot which stretches plausibility to make sure all odd ends are tied up and the clichéd theme of taking control of your life, you'd expect quite the train-wreck on your hands.Despite all expectations otherwise, the film works, barely. The themes may be familiar, but they still retain familiar human appeal. The film is shot beautifully, helped by varied geographies and some inventive camera work, especially in the credit sequences. The music too befits an undertaking of this nature and overall, the film, while not uplifting, manages a marginal elevation of spirits if one has reasonable expectations of it. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think most of us dreamt about the day we stepped out of our usual lives and just go out there to explore the word, our innerselfs or to just make that life turn you've always wanted to make. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is all about this common issue. With a clear message and a fantastic soundtrack this is not only an inspirational movie, but also shows the importance of not being trapped in a small circle in your life. Besides fine performances and beautiful scenery the movie is slow at times. Which makes the climax of the movie a small let down. The main message fails to deliver a 'wow' when it's all done and just seemed a small thing after all.In a beautiful looking movie Ben Stiller gives one of his best performances i've ever seen him do. Every scene has a beautiful flow and fades very pretty into another. If you're all about traveling and self-explore, this is a must see movie. But even if you're not, it's enjoyable and still inspiring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walter Mitty has been explicitly written to appeal to 40-year old losers around the world. How can anybody relate to this irrelevant guy is beyond me. He has a love interest that nobody cares about, a job going the way of the dodo, and a purported "adventure" nobody cares about either.This film is filled with irrelevant fantasy segments while devoid of any motivation or character development. The central character is forced into absurd problems that would never happen in today's world, and is also written to make decisions that contradict his personality, with absolutely no motivation.The reason for this guy to be irrelevant is that, provided this film was properly written, he would have taken his retirement package and quietly gone home to cry himself to sleep. He would never spend his money in this absurd adventure of his when he is on the verge of unemployment.The whole skateboard plot is trash; even though a guy with this personality could somehow be an expert skater after 40, the whole ride in the middle of the film is not only boring, but also unwarranted; he could just get into the car and avoid skating altogether.Films based on the assumption that moviegoers are idiots should be stopped. Don't waste your time on this thing.</fullReview>

He's shy, been stuck at the same job for 16 years, lives at home, can't attract the ladies and is incredibly awkward around people.The film starts off with him having dream like 'zoning out' visions. I thought this was the premise of the film but these are soon forgotten, did they run out of budget? Over night he becomes a dare devil adventurer, jumping out of helicopters into freezing cold water, wrestling with sharks, yep, this really happened, he wasn't zoning out.The film is so dumb that any profound attempts are simply ruined by almost impossible and unbelievable situations. Being left to climb the Himalayas without a guide, playing football at 18,000 feet, yes thats almost as high as Kilimanjaro, I've been there, and believe me, the air is so thin YOU won't be able to run around and play football. And what about his jabs? You don't just turn up to countries like Afganistan without having any, I assume as he is so boring that he hasn't had them done for previous trips to Phoenix. Any you cant take food on a plane and into another country. Dumb, dumb, stupid.The scenery is amazing at times, but the film is way to dumb to enjoy it.Oh, and when do online dating companies call you back.

Failures include Adam Scott, Papa John's, the whole piano thing, the clues from the negatives, the shark scene, the Grease thing, product placement, the wallet, and on and on and on....About the only things that kinda worked was the guy from "King of Queens" getting a few laughs, and of course the incredible views of Greenland, Iceland, and the Himalayas. WOW........ I read the background story of the movie and the problems with production. With all the time they had to produce this movie, this was the best script they could come up with? It's like cracking a tough nut and there's nothing there. Hollow. The effort is not worth it. This movie is supposedly about "feel". It's like a major tagline of the movie. Yet in truth it makes you feel nothing. There is no reward in the end. Sorry Stiller. I like you but you blew it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The remake is straightforward, with fewer secrets, more sentiment and it isn't as funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Thurber's short story "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" was first filmed in 1947 with comedian Danny Kaye. It was a very funny but overlong slapstick comedy about an ordinary man who worked for a publishing company but was also a dreamer and had fantasies about being an adventurer and a hero. A new adaptation had been discussed since the 1990s. The overtones of the American Dream are why the film caught the attention of major Hollywood players. Both Ron Howard and Steven Spielberg were courted to direct the film and Jim Carrey was to play Mitty until Ben Stiller came on board. Ben Stiller's choice of comedy has been self-deprecating, making a career of playing sad sack characters who are either uptight or downtrodden victims. Yet I wondered if this project is a form of personal therapy for Stiller to escape this typecasting. His last two films (Tower Heist, The Watch) have underwhelmed the US box office, which suggests audiences are cooling on the act too. In some interviews he has said that he has bipolar disorder but then later withdrew the comment. Mitty is a thin veil of Stiller's own self-image, playing a lonely character that is bored by rigid, corporate barriers and dreams of leaving America to explore the more exotic parts of the world. It is a well-intentioned and personal concept undone by a poorly developed script by Steve Conrad (The Weather Man, The Pursuit of Happiness). The modern setting is the most problematic aspect. There are some timely ideas setting the film today, referencing the downsizing of companies and moving from print media to online material. Yet the thin MacGuffin- driven plot, involving Walter's search for a missing film negative, is ridiculously contrived. The magazine's photographer (played briefly by Sean Penn) is said to be old fashioned because he doesn't rely on technology. What major publishing company, large enough to have corporate suits (like Adam Scott's obnoxious character), still relies on developing negative photographs? The plot, crossing from Iceland, Greenland and Afghanistan, doesn't stitch together well at all. The clues surrounding the negative are sown loosely by cheap coincidences and luck, too easily revealing the constructs used to shuffle Mitty to the next episode of self-discovery and skateboarding.It's painful to think how much Jim Carrey could have done with the central character. Danny Kaye was a master of physical, slapstick comedy so despite Walter being a dreamer he still engaged us. I think Jim Carrey in his prime would have brought similar qualities. Walter is a deliberately bland and reserved character, played with such minimalism by Ben Stiller that he's almost in a trance. I wish there were more jokes in the film. Save for the odd line, he doesn't provide as many laughs as we'd expect. A telling moment in the film is when Patton Oswalt appears, playing a technician from the website eHarmony, and with his charisma he instantly lifts the film's energy levels. Even Kristen Wiig, Hollywood's comic darling at the moment, has been reined to play a single mother that Walter is looking to court. Their scenes together have little chemistry because neither of them is very funny, resorting to staccato dialogue in a subplot of clichés. Count the number of times you've seen that moment where the hero walks to the love interest's door and it's answered by someone else. I've liked some of Ben Stiller's other efforts as a director (particularly Tropic Thunder), but behind the camera his work is patchy. The film is purposely formalised but adjoined to unoriginal and obvious thematic ideas. In the opening street scenes the camera crabs sideways and the colours are drab and metallic to show how mechanical and rigid the city and its people are as a reflection of Walter's immobilised lifestyle. It is the type of idea that Charlie Chaplin would have been celebrated for back in the 1930s. Though the fantasy sequences are brisker than in the original, they are also more bombastic and the pace of the film feels long and sluggish. Part of the fun of the Danny Kaye film was deciphering whether Mitty was fantasying or not. The remake is straightforward, with fewer secrets, more sentiment and it isn't as funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another move where Ben Stiller plays the same basic character as he does in all of his movies, (A loser/underachiever) and comes out full swing at the end overcoming his loser persona. The plot line is a little thin and extremely predictable. Admitlitly the story is likable but it is the same basic story that you see him play in most of his movies. (His acting hasn't improved much either) The soundtrack was surprisingly very good, and helps you get through the movie with a little more ease. I highly do not recommend this movie unless you are using it for background noise or something to fall asleep to. Side note, his beard, although real in the movie, looks very fake and is off putting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie with great promise falls short due to fractured plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is certainly a movie with great promise that falls apart due to a rather incoherent and disjointed plot. The basic elements of film making seemed to have been ignored by its producers. As a result, the movie can easily lose its audience in the first 40 minutes. The movie is another example that the sum of its parts does not lead to a complete piece of art. I am even surprised that it has done well financially, perhaps due to its cast. Furthermore, its underlying themes do not make it a good family movie. Too much time is wasted on trivial pseudo-funny scenes that seemed to have been borrowed from a mediocre sitcom.In summary, the storyline could have been handled better by savvy production designers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was laying in bed tonight and didn't know what to watch, i started to watch like 5 films tonight and non of them got my attention, but than i turned on this film, beginning was not fascinating or adventures, and that is what i liked, so i kept watching and film got so interesting and with thought whats going to happen or what he is about to do. And got all the answers and it was worth to watch plane beginning.I was truly amazed of this film, at first i thought it would be more comedy type, but no. This film is really beautiful, with beautiful music, landscapes. This film makes beautiful with, what feeling its giving. This film is inspiring to those who want to do big steps in life, but never take chances of being afraid all the time of whats gonna wait them out there in another world. Easy to watch and enjoy even when you're alone in the bed. I recommend to watch this film ,wont regret.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's very rare that I like a "remake" of a film as much as (let alone more than) the original. Then again, to call this Ben Stiller film a "remake" isn't truly a fair estimation either. There aren't many similarities with the two films beyond some basic concepts which, in this case (in my humble opinion), actually helps the film. I am a cinephile at heart, and love old films tremendously. But I did not enjoy the original. It's plot was sloppy, humor hit or miss and, in certain respects, it's viewpoint unnecessarily cynical. However, this modern retelling of the James Thurber short story was, to me, a breath of fresh air in the annals of filmmaking. It was not laden with cynicism, as we find with most films today that seem to go for "darker, harder, grittier". The story, as well as the characters, were relatable, the cinematography was near flawless-both technically and aesthetically-and even the protagonist (Mr. Stiller himself) manages to be detached from reality, at least initially, and still exude an optimism that pervades the story from beginning to end. We are pulled into the character's perspective via the excellent cinematography (which is as much a character as Walter himself; in fact an extension of him) from the opening frame. The style of the shots begins very locked-off, symmetrical, and calculated-much the way Walter governs each step of his daily routine. However, as the film goes on, and the real Walter begins to emerge for the first time in years, the shots take on a more kinetic, documentary-esque feel. Not to be understated either is the precise editing and perfect score/music collection that helps drive our main character, as well as the film's narrative, ever forward. Though the film has its minor flaws (after all, no art can be perfect), we see each layer of Walter delicately peeled back to reveal his character and why his true self has been "locked away" for so long, as the film unfolds. We are given just enough information to piece him together and see that the more he starts "doing", the less he "goes into one of his little places" (to quote Shirley McClaine as his mother, describing his overactive imagination). This is reflected in the fact that the film begins with one imagination sequence after another, but slowly gives way to "reality" (albeit a slightly exaggerated reality, much like visual hyperbole to drive the core message home). It doesn't condemn imagination, but rather encourages it as the foundation for meaningful life, for both ourselves and those close to us; using imagination for a greater purpose. It's a true "coming of age" tale-coming of middle age by returning to your true, lost self at young age, to reconcile the two portions of your life into one solid individual. Sadly, this film didn't rate well with many critics. But that's to be expected; after all, it didn't feature enough violence, obscene language or gratuitous sex. It didn't offer any real "shock-value" that many seem to think necessary to classify a film as "brave" these days. The film, however, IS brave ("Adventurous, Brave and Creative" to be precise), especially for suggesting-and proving-the notion that cinema/art can still be powerful, entertaining, and thought-provoking without ever uttering a single "F" word. So thank you Walter/Ben Stiller for reminding us what true bravery is. After all, "That is the purpose of Life."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After working in office with 12hrs work everyday i felt this movie truly brought out what IT guys and everyday job people want and should do. Never in life saw a movie so inspirational. Though there was some fiction and imagination and the movie overall sent a clear message. Being in India having so much competitiveness. And Politics and other stuff going on we simply forget what is meant for life. We are just running after money like dogs but what once you have it !!!. I went for a small trek Valley of flowers in India. Met lot of people who were in their 40's and 50's . They only told me that their only regret in life was that other than job and money they never did anything else. Looking back at their life days they felt they never did anything actually to enjoy life now they have money but due to health and age cant do anything. Maybe people should strive for friends, family, visiting nature, seeing world ... Money is nothing but a piece of paper that will come and go but the experiences and memories will be something that will be with you forever.</fullReview>

Ben was entertaining and hilarious without effort, no silly antics, just plain funny situations and Ben's reactions were funny without trying to be funny (It's not a porpoise, it's not a porpoise!). I enjoyed every aspect of this film, soundtrack, dialog, everything! Thanks Ben for some down time, just chilled and relaxed down time! That's what movies should be about!

		<shortDescription>A bland average film directed by the star of the film Ben Stiller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a fan of Ben Stiller's ever since I can remember as I have seen him in a lot of films ranging from Meet The Parents trilogy,to the Night At The Museum trilogy,even that film There's Something About Mary. So Ben directed,produced and starred in this 2013 fantasy based on a short story by James Thurber. It starts off with Stiller as Walter Mitty a man who is on a dating site and he has a crush on a girl called Cheryl(played by Kristen Wigg sporting a much darker hairdo,who happens to be a single mom to a teenage son)who happens to be working in the same company as him. Walter however isn't like your average ordinary guy because he often daydreams about being a mountain climber,or a superhero (where he saves Cheryl's dog),or where he battles with his boss(played by Leap Year's Adam Scott who acts as a jerk towards Walter). Walter of course ends up going to Iceland and Afghanistan to track down a man called Sean O'Connell (played by Sean Penn)as he looks up to Penn's charcther and travels to these places in order to track him down. So can Walter track Sean down ?Overall the cinematographic is beautiful to look at,as Iceland seems to be a very beautiful place to visit,as for the downer the story is a tad bit dull and Walter going into daydreams is pretty stupid but hey his suppose to do this as this is based off a short story about a man who daydreams about being whoever he wants to be as he hates his job.Keep an eye out for Shirley McClain as Walter's mother and a spoof of Brad Pitt's film The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button.Ben Stiller should just stick to comedies like Night At The Museum and Meet The Parents as well as that 2004 film Dodgeball which were classic Ben Stiller comedies.Overall its a 2.5/5 for me and out of 10 a 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually Stunning But Lacking in Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013) tells the story of a man on his quest to travel around the world for work duties. But mysteriously the photo is misplaced, leading Walter on a global quest to retrieve it from the enigmatic photographer (Sean Penn). The resulting journey of self- discovery is both physical and psychological as work becomes secondary to personal fulfillment. The film is uneven and episodic by nature, with some awkward transitions between fantasy and reality, showcasing everything from broad comedy to effects-driven action sequences to lighthearted romance involving a sympathetic co-worker (Kristen Wiig). That playfulness is a better fit for Stiller's versatility than the flimsy mystery and the soul-searching voyage that bogs down the second half of the film. Those not willing to completely buy into its concept will find the story logic fundamentally flawed.</fullReview>

I found the story so slow and couldn't even get past an hour of watching it before I had to turn it off. The scenery is great, I'll give it that, but it's following a middle aged man who works in a failing company trying to track down a freelance photographer to figure out where a missing negative is. But, the guy is a coward and doesn't tell a girl that he likes her. All in all, it reminded me a lot of "One Hour Photo" that also went very slow. I guess it's not my kind of style of movie.

		<shortDescription>A bit too long and with a bit too little happening...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a Ben Stiller movie, then "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" wasn't particularly impressive. That being said, don't get me wrong. I am not saying that it is a bad movie, it was just something entirely different from what I had expected, and there was a surprising shortage of comedy in the movie.The story is about Walter Mitty (played by Ben Stiller) who works at Life magazine, where he is in charge of the negatives of all the photo shoots. When the magazine is going to run its final issue, before going to the online media, Walter is left in charge of negative #25, which is to be the front cover. However, it is missing from the roll, and in his search for the elusive photographer Sean O'Connell (played by Sean Penn), Walter travels far and wide - in search for something to which he has been blind.Actually, very little did happen throughout the course of this almost two hour long movie, which tended to make the movie sort of drag along from time to time.This is not your usual Ben Stiller movie, and for that it is interesting. But the overall movie just didn't really appeal all that much to me. Sure there were some nice moments here and there, but the movie lacked force and punch.There are some nice names amongst the list of cast in this movie, and people were doing good jobs with their given roles and characters, I will say that much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HK Auteur film review - The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Typically I am not a fan of Ben Stiller's comedy, whenever he dons a wig and plays a crazy character, it is one-note and awkward. Stiller fares best when he is a normal person reacting to an awkward situation as opposed to being the source of awkwardness and the nebbish Walter Mitty character certainly plays to those strengths. Stiller's other brand of 'costume play' comedy in the fantasy sequences is fortunately reduced to a minimal. Here he is at his most naturally charming and Zoolander fans may disagree, but this is now officially my favorite thing Ben Stiller has directed and acted in.Kristin Wiig is also naturally charming as Mitty's love interest and gets to shine in a musical sequence where she does a cover of David Bowie's Major Tom. Sean Penn has a funny supporting role as artsy photographer Sean O'Connell. Penn's trademark intensity is smartly sourced for laughs in a self-deprecating fashion similar to when Chris Rock quipped at Penn's humorless comeback over Jude Law at the Oscars.The production design is impressive, with its visual compositions practically lifted from hardcover graphic design books and nifty editing transitions accompanied with cool looking fonts, which to some extent owes itself to Stranger Than Fiction. Stuart Dryburgh's photography delivers a true sense of awe for New York's urban cityscape and Greenland's natural landscapes. The story reason is to make Walter Mitty look like an ant in a big world, but that overwhelming sense of the environment towering over man seeps over onto the audience.The reality of the film's own world is suspect, like the logistics of how an employee is able to leave work and fly off to a foreign country, or how much of a jerk the new corporate supervisor played by Adam Scott is being. None of this matters because the story is a fable after all. The viewer may feel in moments they need to give the story the benefit of the doubt. If that moment should occur, go along with it. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is imaginative and humorously made, and even in its weaker illogical moments is ultimately compensated by its charm. The lesson of someone who realizes he is missing out on life from daydreaming is just darn compelling, and it is emotionally cathartic watching Mitty wake up.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoilers*This was almost one of the worst movies I have EVER seen. The beginning of the film starts out confusing and hard to follow. Walter's day dreams are not interesting and the trailer revealed almost every exciting event in the film. Stiller's character is not interesting and would bore anyone. The plot was remotely interesting and I was finally pleased when he begins his journey to Greenland and Iceland. The sightseeing was the ONLY part of the film I enjoyed. The WORST part of the movie, which I read in another review, was the advertising! I understand that all movies have product placement and advertisements but this was absolutely ridiculous. I felt like I was watching a two hour commercial. Not only do they place the product, but they verbally recognize it multiple times. SO annoying I almost turned it off.

		<shortDescription>A lovely feel good adventure. Stiller nails it yet again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was quite magical. It had moments that rival the best of them. And to think Stiller directed it? What can't he do? It was what I would describe as magical realism, but without the nonsense. There were a few scenes that were a little far out there, but the leap of faith required was not beyond the pale, which is a lot more than I can say about most Hollywood films, that have any level of action, these days. It was a very creative endeavor, and I give Stiller a lot of credit for it. The cinematography was wonderful. The locations were amazing. The spirit of adventure was admirable. The characters were believable. Some great spoofs, especially the boneheads with the beards. And Kristen Wiig was believable, sincere, funny, and charming. In all, the cast was great.Considering that the last film Stiller directed was Tropic Thunder, which was hilarious, this guy has some real talent behind the lens too.Many are knocking this film, as being too positive, too optimistic, too lighthearted, or too insubstantial. I just do not get all that. It is a feel good film. I suppose, in this day and age, for some that is just too much to deal with. For some of us, it is just really good entertainment. Have we really degenerated to the level where that is not OK anymore?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably my favourite Ben Stiller movie. There are plenty of so-called 'adventure' films out there, many of them are dull and uninspiring, but 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' is one of the few that is genuinely interesting and enjoyable.This is a funny film, silly in parts, but the humour isn't overdone or forced. The plot in itself is verging on ridiculous, far from believable, but the film makes up for it in charm and entertainment value. Stiller is a naturally funny actor and he delivers an extremely good performance as Walter Mitty, a relatable and endearing character.This is a terrific adventure movie, one of the best in the genre. Interesting story, funny humour, relatable characters and beautiful scenery and production. A great movie all round.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a pursuit of happiness but Walter's secret life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I LOVE this movie and would give it 20 stars if I could. It really speaks to people who have let their real selves be smothered by the obligations of life. I relate so much to this film. Let me start off by saying that I just finished watching Hector and the Pursuit of Happiness. While I thought the movie was a good try, Walter Mitty nails the whole "I'm having an existential crisis" genre. Hector knowingly and purposely went out to find out what happy means. Walter's happiness in the movie was a result of him letting himself be himself. It wasn't forced and was more natural. I really enjoyed the character development of Walter. At first he seems like a distracted, uptight, weakish type person. But as the movie carries on, I understand more about him. His daydreams represent extensions of his actual personality that the mundane reality of his life stifles him from becoming. When Walter is a kid, he had a mohawk and was a skateboarder. Walter has strong values, he loves his family and wants to do his job to the best of his ability. He is adventurous in his daydreams - until one day his since of integrity pushes him to explore his true self. He is truly a man of courage and adventure as he learns on his journey. That sense of freedom, from when he was a kid, before he had to take on the role of man of the house, comes back to him after all those years. He matures and learns that the only thing stopping him from making his dreams reality is his perspective. I love how his true personality (the adventurous kid with a mohawk and skateboard that is deep down) squeezes out his "secret life" which he makes a reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) is a negative asset manager at the Life Magazine. Although he tries dating sites to find himself a company, he is in love with a woman named Cheryl Melhoff (Kirsten Wiig) working at his workplace. The company is downsizing because they are going online and most of its employees are on the verge of losing their jobs. Meanwhile, Sean O'Connel (Sean Penn), a very successful photographer whom the magazine works with, sends a telegram(!) to the company saying that he mailed the negative of a very special picture for the cover of the magazine's last print. But the negative is nowhere to be found. Walter, threatened by losing his job, takes an action to reach Sean O'Connel whose whereabouts is unknown and embarks on an adventurous global journey to find the missing negative. Directed and starred by Ben Stiller, does this movie have a realistic plot? Probably not. Is it dull and predictable as it gets? The answer may be yes for some viewers. However, bombarded by all these comic book action hero movies in recent years, which is critically acclaimed by the critics, realistically impossible, and quite predictable, let it be. This is "my" action movie because I am a day dreamer and zone out quite often as Walter does. The movie is very entertaining, uplifting, and full of spectacular views around the world. It is good to see Ben Stiller in a role outside of his goofy portrayals.Bottom line is life is what we make of it. :)</fullReview>

The whole movie is based on the idea of experience, daily life and travel. The sceneries offer the movie impressive visuals and the adventures of Walter Mitty can be felt deeply from the person in front of the screen. The movie is not a comedy, although it has some moments of satire and if you think Ben Stiller only plays in comedies, this film shows that he can do much more than that. If you are searching for a realistic, fun to watch movie with a good story, this is the way to go. In three words: Experience; Feel; Travel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was a great movie. Its uplifting, interesting and has an often relatable story filled with beautiful cinematography and a great soundtrack. Its not the usual comedy you'd expect from Ben Stiller although there are still moments where he shines through but this maintains a more calm sense of humour throughout.Walter Mitty works for Life magazine in the negative assets sector. He lives a tedious and safe life, and spends much of his time lost in elaborate daydreams, filled with heroism, romance and action. When his job becomes threatened, Walter takes action in the real world embarking on a global journey in order to obtain a photo negative from the mysterious and elusive independent photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) that the magazine needs for its final issue.There are a lot of messages in this film, I would even say the whole premise is open to interpretation. Does he really travel to Greenland and Iceland? Battle sharks? Escape a volcanic eruption? Climb mountains? Excel at skateboarding -loved that scene- or is the entire movie just another one of his elaborate fantasies? I love movies that create dialogue or make you think and everyone will take something different from this extraordinary adventure. It's open for translation which is another reason I think this is such a great movie. I would definitely watch this one again. 3/6/16</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film made for people and life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From all the movies I have ever watched, this made me feel human. I never thought that a movie could personify unpredictability, loss and love as well as this move has. If you are a person, living the "dream", you will probably find this movie dull, or for the lack of a better word, boring. However, portrayal of the human condition is transcended. Some of us struggle to find joy in our daily jobs, despite touching people in a way we never realized. Some of us have lost hope finding someone special, even though the future is so unpredictable. Some may think our lives are basically over, unknowingly realizing that it has only begun. Some misjudge the value of family, discovering that family has been watching out for you all along.If you have ever felt like this, this is the movie to watch. A feeling of warmth will arouse you. True, you may never discover the world or perhaps find meaning in your day job, but being happy with who you are is a certainty. Ben Stiller, a traditional charismatic actor, has found a way to portray what it is to be normal. By doing so also portraying what it is to be extraordinary. I highly recommend this movie. Do not expect action, all out love or comedy. Who you are, as a person, watch this movie and open your heart to possibilities. Who knows? You might find inspiration!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>21st Century Secret Living</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the same short story as the 1947 Danny Kaye film of the same title, this is a vastly different big screen adaptation, updated for the twenty-first century with a basic story that is more grounded in reality. The film begins on a similar note to the 1947 incarnation with Mitty (played here by Ben Stiller) tripping in and out of fantasy and reality, however, whereas Kaye in the 1947 version gradually found himself involved in a real life conspiracy more fantastical than any of his daydreams, Stiller finds himself on a more humdrum quest to track down a photographer and a missing negative here. This narrative deflection leads to the Stiller version being less funny (the 1947 film derives much humour from nobody believing Kaye about the elaborate conspiracy). The most disappointing element of the 2013 film though is how Mitty's fantasies so quickly take a backseat to reality in line with a positive thinking and 'living life to its fullest' message. Mitty's fantasies are not valued here, whereas in the earlier film they are what makes him so good at his job in the first place. Comparisons aside though, the 2013 film is not half-bad for what it is (though at two hours it feels incredibly long). Stiller makes for an excellent milquetoast Mitty, the vistas on display are breathtaking, and Mitty's office building, full of blue hues, is an incredible feat of art direction. The film also has some nice, offbeat moments too (Stiller realising just how large certain beer mugs are) in the parts where the filmmakers do not try too hard to be funny, touching or sentimental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uplifting. Life affirmation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When life becomes burden, one's muscle strength may not be enough. You need to find more motivation. The most powerful thing enough to carry you on is hope and dreams. They are the best fuel for your life."To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other, and feel - that is the purpose of life" The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.Walter Mitty, a negative assets manager, works at Life Magazine. For 16 years, he has co-worked with photojournalist Sean O'Connell, processing his photographs to final output. Mostly occupies a dark room of negatives, he hides in a world of photos. We know little about Walter's life, but it seems ordinary. He owns a small apartment, carefully notes financial liabilities, no chaos in his life, no surprises. With black pants, a white shirt and a creme jacket he is mostly invisible to coworkers and the rest of the world. We can say Walter is very responsible and down to earth. His lifestyle has left him with overcompensation by imagination and zone-ing out. Whenever there is an opportunity, he dives in imagination where he is bold and adventurous. He needs to put a vast amount of courage to send a wink on a social network. Walter would struggle with his life till a small error has occurred. The unpredictable failure that forced him to take action and sets his life in a new direction. Walter back as a changed man.Ben Stiller based his screenplay on a James Thunder's short story published in The New Yorker in 1939. This is not a first adaptation of The Secret life of Walter Mitty, in 1947 Norman Z. Mcleod decided to rely truly on a Thunder's plot. Stiller did not make a faithful adaptation of a novel; he decided to exploit an idea of daydreaming as well as keep humble and restrained Walter as a protagonist. The director has built a two-dimensional figure. At first, Walter is passive and submissive, as resigned by his gray life. On the other hand, is a person with dreams and desires, who is hope driven. This one's life is caught up in a situation that makes Walter believable. Stiller transferred character in modern times. It may seem as a surprise, that Ben Stiller has undertaken this project. To the wider public, he is known as a director of pastiche movies with high attention to media personalities or media influence. Zoolander, Tropic Thunder, The Cable Guy were a production that presents a complexity of annoying protagonist that seeks attention and emotional need to connect with other people. Funny and awkward at the same time. At first, the person cannot be understood but eventually finds his place in the current situation. This is a core of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Stiller took the awkwardness of character and surrounded him with realistic scenario and jaw-dropping plot twists. Some might think that Walter is very trivial character , but his simplicity and frugal personality makes his life more dramatic. Walter Mitty is a person that has stage of the life based on growing up figured out, he persevered with the obstacles that life have thrown him, but it is hard to say that he is a happy person. For him things didn't turned out so great. When you see Walter You think, no, for him life is done.Ben Stiller does the best job of directing, especially with the ironic, neurotic play of Walter. Stiller tends to undertake topics that are a black comedy with a hint of intelligence and humility. Walter is in his career most mature developing character. A bit tired with life's baggage, got a chance to leave behind the old ordinary life. Walter has grown up from this. His directors work has been still mature but served in a light way, and this is a merit of cooperation with established cinematographer. Stuart Dryburgh known from the movie: "The Piano" or "The Painted Veil" cups Walter in extensive plans, landscapes giving center character lightness and freedom. There's no denying that the actors invited to the shoot Kristin Wiig, Kathryn Hahn, Patton Oswalt. can not have a substantial role, but create reliable characters, original and amusing. All the actors managed to give unique characteristic. Oswald with his voice expresses sympathy and companionship, Hahn wit and peculiar clumsiness Wigg, a quiet lady that is just like the main character is clumsy. An attractive choice seems to be the soundtrack. Despite the good selection of songs from the so-called scene "indie", it sometimes appears that the whole musical character had to get a younger audience sympathy. I would recommend this movie to all of those that like stories full of life affirmation. It is light and fun story that will lift your mood.visualandwriting.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ben Stiller Does Great in Front, as Well as Behind, the Camera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is directed by and stars Ben Stiller as Walter Mitty, a man with a boring job and boring life. Most everyone that works with him makes fun of him, mostly because he zones out a lot. He daydreams. He daydreams of himself being a Latin mountaineer, or saving Cheryl's (Kristen Wiig), a woman he's interested in, three legged dog from a building explosion. At his job, he processes negative photographs, sent from a mysterious man named Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn). One day, he doesn't receive a particular negative from Sean; the one he claims is his best photo yet. After too much pressure from his superiors, he takes off and goes on a real life adventure to find Sean, taking him to Greenland, Iceland, and Afghanistan.To start, this film is directed beautifully. Ben Stiller does a great job in front of, as well as behind, the camera. The cinematography is some of the best cinematography of the 21st century. I'd even dare to compare it to Avatar, especially since these shots are real life, and not CGI. The wide shots of mountain landscape in Afghanistan, or the volcano is Greenland is amazing. Ben Stiller's camera work is really good, which isn't too common in actors-gone-directors, but he does great.The acting is also pretty good. Ben Stiller, like I said, does great on both sides of the camera. Kristen Wiig does good as well, which was unexpected. Sean Penn, given the little screen time he has, does amazing. He really owns the role of a danger-seeking photographer. Adam Scott, with his fake beard, plays a great jerk- off boss; constantly making fun of Walter and calling his "Major Tom." There's also a child actor in this film, and he's about 12 or so. He does okay, but didn't really excite me in his performance like I wanted him to. He just seemed like a normal kid trying to act in a middle school play.The plot seems a bit weird, but it plays off very well. The film was based off of a short story, written by James Thurber. It's hard to turn a short story into a feature length film, but this movie does it, and does it very nicely. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty also has some good comedy. There's a scene in this film that pokes fun at The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), and it's freaking hilarious. That's all I'll say, because I don't want to spoil anything.The main negative in this film is a certain character. It's hard to talk about this character without spoiling anything, but his name is Todd. Todd is periodically in the movie, and almost for no reason. Towards the end of the film, the audience gets to see why he was placed there, but it feels like a rushed excuse. It seems as if the writers got to a certain point, and got stuck on finding a way out. So, they threw Todd in random places throughout the movie, just so they could get out of a sticky situation.Overall, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a really good film, and I quite enjoyed watching it. I think the movie's pretty underrated, and deserves a bit more credit than what it's received. I'm going to give The Secret Life of Walter Mitty a B+, or an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A waste of time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me 3 years to decide I wanted to give this a try. 3 wasted years where I did not watch this beautiful movie. What a waste of time :) But better late than never.I liked this movie because it is honest but not boring. Many films which are spectacular are not honest, they want to be cool and miss the point. Many films which are honest are a bit boring and a bit pretentious in their "important" message. This film has got a nice balance. It did not shake my LIFE from the grounding, but this may be because I am becoming old and more balanced. What this film did, was coming at the right moment, when I am learning not to zone-out. Yes I am one of those "open eye dreamers". Not as extreme as Walter, but, still there. So, there is a moment in the mountain with Sean talking of here and now. It is a very known concept (and yes, I still have to read Eckhart). Normally I hate when people talk of this, because they mostly do it in a very new age, sentimental way. Maybe it was just the right moment, maybe it was the film, but the message arrived. As said, it did not change my life. I did not book a ticket to India of dated the girl of the next door. I did not wash the dishes, cleaned the mess of my apartment, studied or did any of the things I procrastinate since a while. But I feel it arrived.The film is nice anyway and even if you do not care about here and now and such bla bla, I doubt you or anybody with a little brain and a little heart may not like it.Give it a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie gets off to a slow and shaky start, my wife and I almost stopped watching it. Glad we didn't because somewhere along the way, maybe 30-40 minutes into it you suddenly realize that you're watching a really good movie. I think that point came for me when Ben Stiller imagined Kristin Wiig singing the David Bowie song to him.From that point on just enjoy the ride, this is one of those rare movies (lately anyway) that makes you think, and makes you feel good about the world around us and life in general. It's a quiet, thoughtful, funny movie and those aren't really in style these days but I highlyrecommend you give it a try, you won't be sorry you did. Ben Stillerdid a great job directing and staring in this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ground Control to Major Tom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been two years since the last time I watched this movie: the secret life of Walter Mitty. Recently, something and someone broke into my brain where is already very messy, spinning and dancing in it like a bee, but reminded me of this movie. This time is so different from the first, trying to find out what is happening there. Immediately after I finished this movie, I zoned out as Walter Mitty does! It felt like that I jump and climb onto one helicopter which is about to taking off and I look back towards the ground while holding my breath and can't believe it happened. It seems that my adventure is on! Till now I realize there is a force that made me be reminded of this movie and it turns out to be my desire for an unexpected journey and a test of my limits and a real change! In other words, "To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other, and to feel. That is the purpose of life." Isn't it?Every time when I stand before a steep mountain, ever time when I face the unknown, every time when I have to go and fight alone, every time when I fall, and every time when the helicopter is about to taking off! Every time when I feel my fears, Ling would appear in my brain and then I am fearless! I am also a daydreamer, I admit it, and I am indeed afraid of something and I can feel my weakness, but when I think about her, I will be fearless and never retreat! She gives me the courage and faith, no matter??.So what?? LUF&amp;LUN@WL. "This is ground control to Major Tom! You've really made the grade!" That desire comes exactly from her. Cheryl is the one who gives courage and strength to Walter. Cheryl is the reason why Walter zones out and she will be the one who can stop Walter from zoning out and make Walter feel truly lovely alive. Maybe this story is just a story, but it works on meThe interesting thing and meaningful is the lost film 25 is the photo of focused Walter Mitty himself. You may be a silent and average man in the ocean of crowds, like everyone, or even mediocre in the eyes of someone, but do not look down upon yourself. Actually, you have made the grade!I know this review is very subjective, dominated by my own very personal emotion, but this movie does encourage me to proceed and keep on adventurously, bravely and creatively.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful. Inspiring. Metaphor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those are words that I would use to describe The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. I finished this film feeling inspired and connected with life.The film tells the story of Walter Mitty, a lonely, kind introvert who processes negatives for Life Magazine. Walter has a crush on a coworker at Life, Cheryl Melhoff, of whom he regularly daydreams. The film's plot begins when Life Magazine undergoes new management and a transition to online publication. When a photo meant to be the cover for the magazine's final print issue has gone missing, it is up to Walter to discover the locations of the photo and its photographer, reclusive Sean O'Connell, spurring an adventure of a lifetime.What I love about The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is the visual and symbolic language the film employs. Ben Stiller's direction is appropriate for what the movie is aiming for: his beautiful, perfectly aligned shots give off the indie film vibe and accentuates the details of Walter's life. His daydreams are fantastic yet initially feel real; as his adventure picks up, his real life experiences begin to parallel and seem more like his fantasies. Walter's job at Life serves as the perfect metaphor; as Life transitions to online, Walter begins distancing himself from work (as well as his eHarmony profile) as he pursues his real life.How could so simple a plot be so inspiring? The film focuses more on the themes of the plot rather than the actual plot and, as a result, adds an emotional texture to an otherwise dull storyline. Walter's decision to take the chance and fly to Greenland and search for Sean O'Connell became one of the iconic moments in that film because of how it Stiller directed the scene; the moving camera, the background text that stated Life's motto, the epic indie rock music. Stiller makes his emotional intentions clear and helps the audience experience the world and its potential through the eyes of Walter Mitty.As with any Ben Stiller film, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty has its share of humor. If you're a fan of Ben Stiller's humor, great! If not, this movie is STILL fine for you. The film's best qualities do not rely on the delivery of Stiller's unique sense of humor. The chemistry that develops between Stiller and Wiig (Cheryl) could have been better; only some of their relationship seemed to barely begin picking up by the end of the film, but also leaves an open ending to leave the audience feeling hopeful.Overall, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a beautiful work of art, a fantasy-reality film that inspires its audiences to, like Walter Mitty, escape their fantasies and to begin living life to the fullest potential. Pretty soon, our dreams become our lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is great from the start, within minutes it has a nice flow to it. When the first bit of action starts with Ben Stiller you now its going to be an epic film. The film will touch your soul in ways you may not know. There are multiple moments in the film where it brings a huge smile to your face.Its the little things in this film that make it what it is. For example the way Ben Stiller has adapted to communicating with the locals, he has made it look like he his trying to talk to them physically.How the adventure progresses is just amazing, the way it goes from one mesmerising place to another picturesque scene. By travelling to all these different country's, he is following what his dad wrote in the "Travel Diary".Overall this is a great film, it is one of those family favourites. Everybody will love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To boldly go...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A nice feel good movie about bland Walter Mitty. His life is as dull and he doesn't dare to approach the woman of his dreams, who has started to work at the same place as Walter does. But suddenly the magazine where they work is bought up and turned into an online publication. Everyones jobs is at risk. But the cover photo for the last issue and Walter takes upon himself to find it. And in the process transforms himself and his Life.The movie starts slow, in pace with Walter and his story. And there are some odd turns (and start-overs) as Walter daydeams take over. For me, the story unfortunately got too disjointed. All got better as Walter finally left for his adventure, but then, because of his daydreams, you didn't know how much of it was a real part of the story. Things got better though, and with his confidence growing, the movie grew as well. It turned into a feel good adventure movie, and it was quite fun to follow Walter on his unbelievable adventures.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have I missed something or has the film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bit of a delayed review since its been out for a few years now but having watched it on Amazon Prime last night I feel that I need to get the pain off my chest by talking it through. It might even save a few hours of your life too. The first joke of the film is that it is somehow on 7.3 on IMDb. Bizarre to say the least. I have a lot of time for Stiller, and the other actors are decent. It looks nice, all shiny and HD so clearly someone wanted a quality product. Which makes me wonder how the story got cleared in the first place....The story is all about a dreamer, someone who makes stuff up to pretend to be more than he is. But he then proceeds to actually do a whole host of unrealistic stuff (listed below) that would challenge an expert let alone a dislikeable idiot with seemingly bottomless funds. This brings me to the first point - all this only makes sense when you consider that it is all in his head. Essentially a fantasy within fantasy nestled somewhere within the Matrix. I am still trying to think where the break point was and I can only imagine that it occurred on the station platform at the very beginning. If this is indeed the case then Stiller must have binned the idea and just stuck to the callous product placement funded nightmare that he has made. There are hundreds of issues and here are a few: - It would be amazing if people could actually do a 'transition' in the time it took Life Magazine. - With his 16 years experience he would get a job so quickly. - How many people with 16 years service wouldn't be keen to take the redundancy. - Why would a kid in Iceland switch his virtually new longboard for a dirty Stretch Armstrong. And his parents actually let him do it (even if they were in a rush). - The skate scene was stupid but made more so by the fact that his tie would have broken on the second corner. - He disrespect for people's property is amazing. He takes the only bike at the dock, crashes it into a post (even though it doesn't look damaged) and then proceeds to walk. No matter about the litter, the fact that the bike is unlikely to be returned and that he is completely oblivious to anyone else even when he isn't daydreaming. - He ignores the panicked hotel owner even though he clearly has something to say (btw the guy speaks epic English only 15mins later). -The hotel owner lets him walk away into the volcano for however long but then drives after him to pick him out of it. - Why doesn't Walter just go to the nearest airfield where the yellow plane will land? - Mitty jumps out of the helicopter despite not being anywhere near the boat. Even if he had jumped onto the boat the injuries would have been severe. No lifejacket, no drysuit. How did the pilot expect the radio parts to survive the fall? A flipping rope ladder maybe? - He loses their radio gear and never apologises. - The shark appears ten seconds after he goes in the water but the small boat crew take 5 mins to drive across to him. Even though he would have been long dead from the cold. - He apparently doesn't have to tread water. - The Pilot is suddenly remarkably sober by the time they arrive at the boat. - Why does he travel via Yemen to Afghanistan? Where did he get the time and cash to do all this? - Where did he get his training and gear to go higher than the Sherpa chaps? - How come the 4 Sherpas with Sean Penn didn't have the same problems? - Why did Sean Penn visit Mitty's mum but never bother to see him? - The photo isn't even that good, it would never have been chosen anyway. Plus why was Sean Penn spying on Mitty? - Product placement is ridiculous. - How come the eharmony guy is bordering on stalking? Has he heard about data protection? - Mitty is such a douche bag that he even throws away the wallet. - In my opinion this film was damaging to the LIFE legacy. And on and on infinitum. Stupid film with stupid errors that deserves a sub 6 on IMDb -actually makes you think the studio must be fixing the scores just to try and get some of the budget back....For all you 10/10 people out there - even if this film blew your mind it isn't even worth a 8 because of the product placement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A breath of fresh air....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a fan of Ben Stiller since watching Meet the Parents. I find his comedy to be subtle, yet effective, and I love him for that. In fact, it's been ages since I've watched a movie by him, I guess the last one being Night at the Museum-2. So when I stumbled on to movie on IMDb, I immediately made a grab for it.Well, was I satisfied? I pause awhile before answering this question, 'cause this was not a regular comedy. It attempts to bring out the inherent spirit in a common man who used to encapsulate himself in vivid imaginations. The movie's got some nice graphics and eye- catching visuals of scenic locales. Initially the phases where he'd 'zone out' kinda got to me, and it became extremely predictable when he was in the real world and when in the dream world. But later on, it is a pleasure to see him go on his adventurous pursuits, just to prove he took his job seriously. This is a movie made of Ben Stiller, for Ben Stiller and by Ben Stiller (was surprised to see his name as director in the ending credits). His graying hair gives him a mature appearance, well into middle age as announced by his sister on his birthday, and you kinda relate to the guy going thru' a mid-life crisis, being single and- all. Good if you wanna just relax and curl up on your couch with this feel-good drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie about life and finding ourselves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his fifth realization movie, Ben Stiller returns with a movie more consensual. The action takes place with the character of Walter Mitty who works for the magazine Life but his own life is imaginary. Walter has a big problem: he's a dreamer, and dreamers haven't their place in the world of business. He works from the archive of photography and his daily life is boring. But Walter is really implicated in his work and one day, when a photography's negative disappear, he decides to brave the danger to find it. The movie involves us in a long adventure where Walter fights against shark and survives to a volcano's eruption. During the film, there is a real contrast between the place where he works and dreams about a better life, and his journey in a land, like Iceland or Himalaya, where he finally lives his dream.It's one of the most important point of the movie: the identification of the main character. During all the movie, we follow his point of view and his disappointment. The character seems to be a "normal" person and can be everyone, who doesn't like his works or his boss (played by Adam Scott). We feel a real compassion for Walter and that give to the movie a realistic dimension. An another detail that makes that film a good experience is music. Soundtrack is composed by artists like David Bowie, José Gonsalez or Of Monster and Men, the music is in relation with the visual and the landscape. Without the music, some scenes would have lost their epic dimension.I think "The secret life of Walter Mitty" is an underrated movie because the movie had been realized by Ben Stiller, and also because the main theme is love, like a lot of other movies. Yes, the end of the movie is a happy ending with the girl, but that doesn't get in contradiction with the new Walter Mitty. Finally the movie gives us the envy to take the first plane and leave without over thinking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are certain films that you can watch over and over again. For obvious reasons Groundhog Day is one and so is Walter Mitty. In my opinion this is Ben Stiller's best film role by far. He is terrific as Walter. All the way through the cast list there are memorable performances. The Sean Penn episode in the Himalayas is just about the most original film scene ever.That is if you don't include Walter's skateboard ride in Iceland. Or his helicopter trip ,piloted by the paralytic drunken pilot! This is a real feel good movie.You come out of the cinema holding the hand of your loved one,just as Walter clasped Cheryl's at the end of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a whole this film is a masterpiece in the use of camera techniques as well as use of coloration to adjust the audiences thoughts and feelings. I say that its confusing because in the early stages of the film the character of Walter, played by Ben Stiller, has a lot of really weird daydreams, which is confusing until you notice that the color pallet during his daydreams is slightly more saturated then when he isn't "zoning out" as his sister says. But what sets this movie apart, other then a well put together score is that in the end you see it as more of a comedy piece in that the photo he had been searching for had been in his wallet the whole time, which he threw away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching the secret life of Walter Mitty remind me a little bit about myself, a day-dreamer. But not as terrible as Walter Mitty, I still can realize something happen in my daily life - I'm not a guy that imagine the refrigerator-man as a husband of my crush in a sudden, hahaha. Okay! what was attracting me about this movie is, off course the cinematography. The camera work, angle and visual are some reasons that helped this film to keep breathing scene by scene. I really love movies that capturing a beautifully of the cinematography because film is an art, it can't be presented just like that, at least the movie was done, or it has a plot and it's enough. Yes, the main point of a nice movie is the story line, but a good camera and visual skill will also make a movie is going a step further. Then, the story itself. The Walter Mitty personality made me wanted to know, how this low confident-guy and a dreamer wants to change and get out from his comfort zone. Plus, he likes a single- mom and tries to grab her heart. In this story, he needs to find the lost negative-25 that given by photographer, ' '. How he forces himself to travel outside USA to find the negative-25 and he needs to overcome his dream and imagination by start living in reality. This movie inspired me a little bit for becoming brave to take risk in this life and stop dreaming too much. Achievement in real life by your own struggle and confident are the best thing you get than dreaming. Dreaming may reduce your frustration, but it won't help you to rise. Oh wait! the music score that follow with the scenes of "Mr. Mitty's Running" also has an impact of the movie. After I watched this movie, I didn't feel the comedy after all because before I'm gonna watch it, I thought there would be a usual comedy because I saw Ben Stiller. But what I really felt was the story is very close to me. There are somethings good and lesson in this film. Yes, that story is all about, the origin is to give lesson to the human. Sometimes I think this movie too slow in certain parts, but I still love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life." - © 2013 Secret Life of Walter Mitty MovieThe Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a movie that gets you moving on your feet. The movie teaches us a very essential lesson that just dreaming won't allow your life to succeed. But one should always try to start living rather than just dreaming, and that experiences are essential in achieving one's dream. Furthermore, it grabs the audience's attention with funny imaginations. During the movie, Walter starts zoning out and falling into bright daydreams multiple times. One time, he becomes a hero by saving residents from a burning building; in another, he fights with his boss in a very dramatic action movie like way. The overall ambiance of the film was peculiar, yet special. To illustrate, inspirational quotes popped up and kept you thinking deeply throughout the movie. Personally, I really liked the movie because it seemed very sincere. Nowadays, its hard to find a movie that is sincere. But it wasn't boring. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is funny, but it also isn't a comedy either. It's complicated to put this movie into a particular genre. In a way, its kind of vague but exclusive. Therefore, I would say that The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is my all-time favorite movie! :D100/100</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1947 version of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty has long been a favourite film of mine, certainly one that's lingered from childhood, although it wouldn't be in my top-ten nowadays. That film was the epitome of what a star vehicle could be during the forties; especially for a talent such as Danny Kaye. It's bright, fanciful, puts Kaye front-and-centre with opportunity to showcase his many talents, whilst offering a gorgeous love interest in Virginia Mayo, and a risible villain in the ominous shape of Boris Karloff. Plot-wise, this was paper thin, and whilst Ben Stiller's recent version could have been a like- minded project, this new story far exceeds what was done in 1947 and presents one of the most engaging, uplifting and joyous films of the past year. Directed by Stiller from a screenplay by Steve Conrad, this story of a daydreaming photo executive for Life magazine is a mightily impressive and very sincere effort from Stiller, whose Mitty jumps from train station platforms to burning buildings, battles his new, obnoxious boss like a superhero would a super-villain on the streets of New York, and romances his office crush, played by Kristen Wiig. But this is all in Walter's mind, of course, and part of an imagination wonderfully and creatively realised by Stiller, whose framing, composition and ability to find humour in Mitty, without making a clown of him, is hugely impressive and highly endearing. Even the opening credits are a simply effective visual treat, whilst there's genuine sadness in Stiller's facial expressions, delivery of his lines and the way which he shoots and frames the lonely, grey Mitty. As the story progresses from fantasy to realism, such care and attention to who the character is and what he needs allows for a leap of faith to be taken with Mitty when an important photo negative goes amiss and he decides to find the photographer, played by Sean Penn. There's shades of Hearts of Darkness here, as Penn is almost akin to the elusive Col. Kurtz with regards to Mitty's quest, and if there are a few broadly comical missteps, perhaps Stiller, as a director, felt occasionally unsure of himself in territory largely new to him. But he needn't have. This is utterly charming, life-affirming cinema that I enjoyed tremendously, especially with Stiller on truly ace form both in front of, and behind the camera.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie with memorable scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" Is a 2013 movie that goes for 114 minutes. Secret Life of Walter Mitty is directed by Ben Stiller. He has directed a lot of comedy movies so some people didn't think he could pull of a non-comedy movie but he did a great job with it. It does has comedy bits in it but for the most part it is a more serious movie than comedy. So the genre is Adventure, Comedy and Drama. This movie stars Ben Stiller as Walter Mitty, Kristen Wiig as his love interest Cheryl and Adam Scott as the boss. The story is about this guy named Walter Mitty that has this condition to constantly zone out and imagine himself in these different and weird scenarios and this is one of the main technique for the story telling for at least half of the film. Walter Mitty has a boring life in New York, having an average job, lonely in his apartment and doing the same thing over and over again without real change. This this is one of the reason why he zones out and imagines himself in these situations. He went to work and found out that they are cutting people off because the magazine company that he is working for is going to be an online magazine and Walter has been sent images by this photographer named Sean O'Connell and one of his images is going to be on the front of the final magazine but Walter can't find it so he sets off to a journey to find Sean to these beautiful and various locations and to ask him where the missing photo is. The actors in this movie is well casted and there weren't any bad actors nor the characters they played except for the eHarmony subplot that they put in, so Walter Mitty had some trouble sending "Winks" on the website and called one of the workers at eHarmony to help him with this situation but this guy keeps calling him throughout the movie and it gets annoying and a bit unrealistic. The camera work and the editing in this film was very well done, there was a scene where he was running to catch a ride in a helicopter. This action sequence was in the slow-motion with David Bowie's Space Oddity playing in the back ground. This made the scene very impactful and getting the viewers to know that he is on his first step on his adventure. He travels to Greenland, Iceland, Yemen and Afghanistan and all these locations give this film a lot of life, especially with the camera shots and the music along with it makes it feel like an adventure. The viewer feels like you are inside his head and seeing life through is eyes and makes the film has a very unique style of storytelling. As a viewer you start to realize that Walter zones out a lot less since he has done so many amazing things and seeing beautiful sights, and as viewer you realize that he is making his imagination a reality and this is pretty impactful by the end of the film. So in conclusion this a very solid film with very well done story-telling and having hidden messages having you to figure out some of the elements by yourself. There is some characters with unrealistic characteristics and personality's but the rest of the characters are pretty solid and well written. The theme of the movie is very well structured and shows you what an adventure can be like, feel like and look like. I give this movie 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now this is funny, when I watched the movie I enjoyed it a lot (maybe I drank a bit too much wine). Really I did. But then came the days afterward and the movie lost it. For some reason it kept buzzing in my mind and more and more I got annoyed by the little things in the movie, the silly twists, the flat characters, the unrealistic and not funny occurrences.. Ben Stiller is simply not convincing, I never liked him anyway, the storyline to unbelievable. Overall the acting is flat and uninspired.I expected the most of the movie to be part of his daydreams, simply because it was so unbelievable. Now that would have been OK if they were funny, but they are not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walter Mitty is really a dreamer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess we all know what it is to day dream, get away if it is just for a couple of minutes and pretend we are some place else or someone else. Walter Mitty is really a dreamer, he leads a secret life in his dreams, but one day he has to take action and embark on a crazy journey.This is a wonderful film, the critics was very divided and I can understand some parts of it, if you expect to see Ben Stiller in his usual way (funny and crazy), well you will get some of that but in another way then you might had expected. This film is very down to earth, small everyday things turned upside down and strange encounters is really making this film fun, not in a laugh out loud kind of a way, most of the time it is subtle, small fun things and scenes that could happen to everyone of us, but in this whole plot seem very strange, and unbelievable to happen all at once for this one guy.</fullReview>

I got a message to see myself from the right prospective living its aspiring dreams, it is never too late, and you can do it. Acting of Ben stiller was amazing, I was astonished by his character development through the movie. And I was shocked when I discover that he is the director too. I even think now he is a better director that being an actor, trying to forget the movies he had directed before. Finally it is a real piece of art, dedicated to all viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie with the best scenes!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie flows through beautifully but sometimes i feel that the story line is moving too fast.The scene backgrounds are the best of the movie scene surroundings I've ever seen. This movie surrounds Walter Mitty a typical day dreaming guy.... and beautiful scenes from Greenland and Iceland. These three are the main reasons i liked the movie. The beauty of Earth is well caught in the movie, but considering the story i think it is not that strong enough in the middle. Ending gives a beautiful prospective of a modern day LIFE of people. In short this a story that doesn't contain action,comedy or huge drama but still can keep the audience entertained with it's beauty of camera shots and the meaning it gives.I recommend this movie to every one who loves a story that skips the traditional way of telling story or traditional types of stories and give has a nice ending but also with a good life lesson too.Thank You!

		<shortDescription>How to enjoy Walter Mitty and why it actually can be 10.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be perfectly clear my review is from the perspective of a common audience member with a master in philosophy. You see this movie is about a man and his experience with being pushed into doing something, far more adventurous than he ever expect he would actually have to deal with. That said the way the story is told is something of an emotional perspective, akin to the peace inducing affect of meditation. (I've never meditated but i'd imagine that a person who has would easily relate the slow peaceful shots and appreciation for previously unappreciated things in the movie, to meditation)I find that to enjoy a movie like this you should probably actually TRY to enjoy the movie. For example, extend your suspension of disbelief way further, try to appreciate small details and engross your self in the narrative as if it had deep meaning.To be honest the way people would end up giving this movie anything less than an 8 is if they went in with expectations different of what was delivered, and if they couldn't appreciate a movie for what it was.It's all perspective and a certain perspective is needed to appreciate any movie. From titanic to Saving Christmas, all it takes is a perceptive. you may be asking yourself,"is this even a review?" Well the answer to that is, yes.This movie is as stated before a movie for a person of particular mindset, and i just so happen to be a person who views this movie as a ten. If you like it you'll probably know why. If you don't you probably didn't even read this, but if you have, then consider watching Walter Mitty, with Open eyes.I mean there's plenty to, appreciate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie started out slow for me and was starting to get a bit tedious with Ben Stiller's portrayal of the title character, but the Greenland/Iceland trip managed to win me over. Kristen Wiig's take on Bowie's "Space Odyssey" was what was needed to add some poignancy to Walter Mitty's (Stiller) quest to discover himself, find adventure, and win over the unattainable love of his life.I guess the reason I mention Iceland is because I toured the island in 1977, and it's really not the place one thinks of as a favored tourist destination. There was no Papa John's there forty years ago, so I guess they've come a long way. Actually, I'm still kind of doubting there's one there.What I particularly enjoyed was the way the film had Mom Shirley MacLaine save the day by recovering Walter's wallet from the trash can. That brought the movie full circle back to the mysterious Negative #25 at the heart of the story. With Stiller directing and in the lead role I wasn't sure what to expect as I'm not a fan of his comedy stuff, but he had a way of making things turn out for the best here. The only question that remains with me is whether Adam Scott's beard was real or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ben Stiller's Best Work. An Achievement and worthy to its Short Story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are expecting to have a film that follows the short story The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, then this is the wrong place for you. But why would they? The reason I'm saying this is because It would have to drag on forever. This film Version of Walter Mitty, Directed and Starring Ben Stiller is a lovable film with heart. What I like about the movie is that it doesn't follow the short story structure. Instead, it explores the ideas found in James Thurber's short story.The story follows Ben Stiller's Character Walter Mitty, A Daydreamer who works at Life Magazine. As they are closing down for their new Online Magazine, Mitty has trouble finding Negative 25 which is suppose to be the cover for the last issue. He goes on a journey to find Shawn O' Connell, the guy who took the picture and to get the negative back in time.The clever thing about the movie is the product placement. It doesn't use it just for backgrounds. It uses them as a essential part of the story-line. Example, Mitty is trying to use E Harmony but is having trouble giving a wink to one person named Cheryl (Kristen Wiig) this plays a significant part in their relationship in the movie. Life magazine plays a big part in the movie also, Life being an metaphor to Mitty's exploration of Shawn which helps his daydreaming. A few other things are a bit important like Mitty's back-story of how he worked at Papa Johns after his father died. On technical levels, Walter Mitty can almost be considered a family friendly blockbuster in some sorts. The visuals are very impressive for it's 90 million dollar budget, its PG rating somehow works for being able to please Preteens, the whole mystery building up to Negative 25 and what it looks like pays off successfully the acting is great and the characters you care for.This possibly could become a classic in the near future. Ben Stiller's best work by far and I hope he does more films like this.89/100 B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious and deeper than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Funny, interesting, great acting and with more depth than one might expect. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty isn't perfect, but it's still very good and well worth the money spent. Walter Mitty works on a magazine called Life Magazine, living an organized and dull life and is constantly pushed around by his boss. A stressed, organized person, Walter's life contains little to no room for spontaneity. He dreams of adventures and is secretly in love with his co worker Cheryl, and tries to contact her through a dating site. Life Magazine is coming to an end, the last issue is on the way, and when the negative of the picture for the front page is missing, Walter sets of for an incredible journey, in which he tries to find not only for the negative but also himself. When I was about to watch this film, my expectations weren't exactly spectacular. Sure, it seemed to be a funny movie, and I would probably get some good laughs, but I really thought that would be it. I couldn't have been more wrong. This really is one of those movies that is just impossible to dislike. One of the things that I liked the most about this movie is the character of Walter Mitty. Played by Ben Stiller, who (along with the rest of the actors) does a fantastic job of making his character come to life, Walter is a character that is very believable and one that could very well exist in real life. His dream of being adventurous, and the struggle he experiences while trying to take the step out of his comfort zone, is something I think a lot of people can relate to. When Walter takes the chance and does something unexpected, he develops in a fantastic way. By the end of the film he's almost unrecognizable, and he is, by all means, a great main character. I also liked how the movie was shot. A good part of it takes place in Iceland, which has some amazing landscapes SP that are a beautiful addition to the film. The soundtrack is also very good, and does a great job at emphasizing the mood of the film, as it should. It doesn't lack humor, either, and made me laugh out loud many times. There is, however, one thing in this film that I thing could have been done better, and that's the plot. It's a great story, but it's a little to easy to tell what's going to happen. The ending was fairly easy to predict, and I think the movie would have played out a lot better with some sort of twist or unexpected ending. Despite SP its shortcomings, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is still a fantastic movie. It tells an incredible story with a great moral lesson, that most people can relate to. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty can be seen by anyone who appreciates a heartwarming, encouraging and believable story with both humor and depth, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in that. This is the best movie I've seen in a long time, and if you haven't already, I would highly suggest that you go see it, as soon as you can. Don't let yourself miss a masterpiece like this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walter Mitty Type</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two things I have learned from this movie. The first being that there is such a thing as a horny Chilean. The second being, apparently, that I may be a Walter Mitty type. Oxford defines Walter Mitty as "Used to refer to a person who fantasizes about a life much more exciting and glamorous than their own life". I guess you could say that we are all Walter Mitty types. Who doesn't sit around and wonder how exciting it would be to do something other than sitting around. I spent the first part of this movie fantasizing. I was bored and imagined some place that would hold much more interest. That boredom did dissipate by the time we caught up with Sean O'Connell, played by Sean Penn. His talk about savoring a moment resonated with myself. The idea that you should enjoy the moment and breath it in. There is so many things in this world that we should be experiencing. Lately, I feel like I should be breathing in every single moment. Whether it be studying the colour of a beer or hearing you son speak of his new found interest in politics, every moment should be cherished.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start off with, this is not a perfect movie by any means (of course, how many are there really?). It has some issues with the length and pace in places. However with that being said, there is something here to really love without a doubt. The filming is incredibly gorgeous with visual popping from the screen. The idea behind this is also deeply endearing and often very funny. Imagining what could be with no limits of the real world. then there is the message of just living. Going out and doing instead of dreaming. This is a message that many should agree with and take on board as we all want to just do something we love. We all want to be happy with what we do and thus, you route for Ben Stiller as he puts his dreams into motion. He is very good in this film and I believe this is one of his best acting roles. I also love the score to this film and I think it is a film I could definitely see myself watching again. I really think, with all this put into consideration that all should see this. It is a fantastic movie and deserves credit for being a dazzling feel good piece. Props to Ben Stiller and his direction and I hope to see more like this</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Feel-Good Experience!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is one of the most thoughtful, pleasant movie experiences of 2013. This seemed to be a really decisive movie, But I'm firmly camped with those who loved it. It is a very unique film and tone is completely different from which we are accustomed with when it comes to Ben Stiller. Tropic Thunder is excellent, and this film is excellent for different reasons. This is an ambitious film which explores the meaning of life. The film features gorgeous cinematography and a rather progressive soundtrack that I personally liked.Ben Stiller's film is about a man named Walter who worked for sixteen years as a manager for negative assets for LIFE magazine. After his and many others jobs are threatened, Walter goes on a personal journey through means of his own fantasies and his own physical journey.The acting is excellent. Ben Stiller leaves his normal comedy style behind to create an endearing, heart-warming performance. I think the same can be said for Kristen Wiig, as Stiller's love interest. Adam Scott is great at playing the jerk boss, but his beard seems a little off. Sean Penn makes a delightful cameo, but I would have liked to see more of his acting here.Overall, the Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a very good movie and it seems to be more of a personal meditation made to guide you through life. I cannot see why some people despised this film, but I guess they must be a miserable as Walter Mitty himself. This is a beautiful-looking film that has such an enjoyable, abstract movie. I rate this episode 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is an interesting prospect. At times it's a very pretty film, as Greenland, Iceland and the Himalayas are some of the most beautiful locations on earth. One could argue that the plot does a good job of merely framing these gorgeous shots. To me this film doesn't quite know what it wants to be. Is it a metaphor for one man's mindset, or is it a literal tale of an everyman's adventure. For me it falls somewhere in the middle and thus isn't really successful at either. It isn't really funny enough or exciting enough to be the latter, nor is it intriguing enough to fit into the former category. I felt at times that the film is trying to drift into the metaphysical, but if it is, then it's so subtle it's almost lost. All this didn't sit that well on my palate. If you take the plot at face value, then it's merely an adventure story of a man finding himself and learning things along the way. All in all, it's alright.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't get the original Secret Life of Walter Mitty and Danny Kaye always made me uncomfortable. This is a much different remake about a photography processing expert at the to-be-revamped Life Magazine who has to locate the negative for the shot which will cover the last published edition of the magazine. Ben Stiller is usually very accessible as an actor, we can get into his head and relate to his predicaments and his solutions. That is never more true than in this movie, maybe because Ben also directs as well as stars. Kristen Wiig is also fine in an understated manner as the girl Ben would like to get to know better. Some of the fantasy sequences (Walter has a penchant for day dreams, often at the wrong time) were a little hard to follow. But some of them worked grandly, particularly Wiig's acoustic rendition of Space Oddity at the Greenland bar, which is a magical and pivotal moment in the movie. There are many breathtaking panoramas of the places visited by Mitty, mostly filmed on location in Iceland. Each time I see this it grows a little more on me, and the enchanting musical score compliments things very well. This sort of has to be taken on its own terms but on those terms it is a very very nice work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Feel Good Epic for our times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A modernisation of the iconic short story, Stiller's version tells the tale of wallflower and daydreamer Walter Mitty (also Stiller), stuck in a meagre existence as a negatives manager for Life magazine. One day, he receives the last batch from an acclaimed photographer (Penn), only to find one of the photos, dubbed 'the best', missing. This sets Mitty on a journey away from his normal surroundings, and into the wider world, letting him have real adventures while also growing confidence to woo a fellow worker (Whig).A feel-good epic, Stiller's 'Mitty' is the sort of film that is rare nowadays; imaginative, but also cheeky with a good sense of heart. Stiller and Whig make fine and charming leads, Adam Scott is a hammily fun villain as the takeover manager, and there's ear and eye candy aplenty, whether it be the rather humorous daydreams of Mitty himself, from saving pets from a burning building to having a concrete surf battle with Scott on the streets of New York, or just the gorgeous and lush landscapes of Greenland, Iceland and Afghanistan. Shapiro's score is similar whimsical yet also reserved and soothing at points, and the song choices all fit the 'life is an adventure' theme very well and don't overstay their welcome.Honestly, I was having such a good time that I couldn't notice much in the way of flaws. Really, aside from Stiller's daydreaming never being properly explained save for a throwaway line from his mom (played by the always lovely Shirley Maclaine), the only other issue is sometimes, the story will move along just to move along, and it can feel a little too drastic at times. Example, when Stiller has to go to Greenland to find Penn's character, after one 'What?', he just pulls together and strides confidently onto the next flight out. You could make the argument that Penn's little mantra about life, which also Life's slogan, entices him, and he's sort of in a daydream state, but before, he was just shy and nervous, and the daydreams are established as being in his mind, so he doesn't actually move. Why now? But frankly, the film's combination of charisma and scope won me over, and was able to smooth out any rough patches in the plot. It's a simple 'get out and live life' tale and executed rather well. Dare I say, it's one of the more likable films I've seen in a good long while, in an age often over-saturated with films that are bright, but really dumb, or dark, edgy blockbusters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is refreshing to have a good PG movie made these days. They are so few and far between. The story was told wonderfully. The scenery was breath-taking. Some things didn't flow, like why would he skateboard, when a car was available - because we would have missed out on the majestic skateboarding scenes. And why not track down the plane that Sean was on in Iceland - because we would have missed out on more intrigue. But those didn't bother us half as much as the handful of lowbrow vocab words that just seemed like flies in a perfect bowl of soup. They were so unnecessary. We would have given it 10 stars if the vocab had stayed away from the smelly and creepy. BY INCLUDING THEM, THEY'VE ALIENATED A HUGE PIECE OF THE CONSUMER PIE and we will be less likely to buy or re-watch the show. Arg. We need more fantastic movies, like this one, but leave the litter out. Please!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll start by saying I wasn't entirely sure what to expect when I sat down to watch this film and as the film started I thought it was going to be some cheesy action film (which isn't always a bad thing) but it was something completely different. I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of this film and how much it connected with me personally. The setting, the music and the acting were, in my opinion, fantastic and everything lent itself to the feel of the film and created a daydream-like atmosphere.So to the reason this film connected with me. Even though I'm 'a grown up' I haven't actually 'grown up' and I believe this is why I was drawn into the film, because I'm a daydreamer. The way I've always seen things, growing up means losing yourself, losing your inner child and, in a way, becoming a completely different person. As a child you have dreams of what you want to be and what you want to do when you grow up and those dreams don't always come true, so we settle into our daily patterns at home and at work, forgetting our childhood dreams. This film shows that being 'grown up' shouldn't stop you dreaming, it in fact gives you the opportunity to live your dreams and see what the world has to offer.Maybe I'm thinking too much into this or getting drawn into the film just a bit too much but it isn't very often when a film feels like it was made for people like me. A film made for the dreamers, a film made for the secret adventurers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An absolute pleasure from beginning to end. Not quite the same storyline as Its a Wonderful Life, but the arc taken by the main character, Walter is very similar. Apparently overlooked by successful people and invisible to many others, Walter wishes for something better. Eventually he takes courage and embarks on a series of real and life-affirming journeys during which, and I think it's not a plot-spoiler to reveal - he finds the true meaning of his life. Hits all the right notes for those looking for encouragement and reassurance that Hollywood still remembers how to play our heartstrings... I loved the soundtrack too - downloaded a few tracks already...!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning and surprising</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a stunning beautiful movie, visually and in all ways that a film can be. It bears little relation to the Thurber short story or Danny Kaye's movie, and the originality - Ben Stiller's choice to make a new film - leads to a wonderful result. This film rewards watching many times, again and again.The performances are uniformly excellent, with Stiller and Kristin Wiig delivering completely captivating, finely nuanced and subtle characterizations that have depth and truth that is very rarely ever seen on screen. While both have been recognized to have skills that go beyond comedy, these performances push them toward the elite levels of acting anywhere. I'm tempted to say, 'Wiig especially', but Stiller actually did just as remarkable a job - perhaps more so, considering how much time he is on screen.And, enjoy Sean Penn's subtle and gentle delivery when he and Walter finally meet...As happens too often, I suspect that Hollywood didn't really know how to market this film. It's great to see it get so much exposure now on cable and digitally-delivered TV.And, have you noticed that Stretch Armstrong has made a comeback appearance in a car commercial!?! That tells you how popular this film has become.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As much fun as one of Walter's imaginings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty is directed by and stars Ben Stiller, who I like, as a bored man who works at Life Magazine in the negatives sector. He regularly escapes into his fantasy world, and eventually embarks on an adventure to retrieve a lost negative. Although my expectations were low, this is a very pleasant surprise. It's both exciting and funny, and an excellent excursion into visually dazzling, witty, dream like escapism. Ben Stiller shows he's one of the best actor directors at work and the film actually looks genuinely great. All but one of the dream sequences are very interesting and Walter Mitty is a character many will relate to. It's not without flaws, but didn't deserve the low rotten tomatoes rating. The 'twist' is painfully obvious, the way that Walter goes and has his big adventure slightly deviates from the point and it can be style over substance, but it's still a lot of fun. In general, it's a very entertaining and relatable movie, with Ben Stiller on full likable ordinary guy mode and full unsung awesome director mode.TSLOWM has a very satisfying and charming plot, and the adventure sequences are really well done. The romance at the centre is slightly predictable, but not overly so and adds to the film's charm. The screenplay has plenty of warmth and likability as well. This is a very enjoyable film with a surprising amount of heart. It's more ambitious than many films of its kind and certainly falls into the 'underappreciated movies of 2013' category. A very entertaining big of escapism overall, if a bit predictable and unremarkable and good viewing for the whole family. It's certainly a lot better than it sounds, and while some have complained about style over substance, there's a fair amount of substance to anchor the style in there. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a very big fan of this movie but i have to admit that its nice to see movie like that . as a slow pace movie which make people happy. The imagination of Walter white is also good .. some time i confuse it with reality but over all its very much clear .. although i would say that some point movie goes very slow and i started to get bored but i think every thing that matter is the end . which is by the way an happy ending .Although the narrative isn't perfect. The script isn't good enough. There are narrative flaws and stretches of the imagination which some time feel ridiculous , but this movie is about stretching the imagination for the right person, this movie is life-changing, life-affirming, and truly beautiful. If the person is interested in traveling and don't have time than i will definitely prefer him to watch this movie . Its all about getting free time for your sell . get a life see the world .See the beauty of this world . mountains etc</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie came as a surprise to me. When I saw the trailer, I was expecting a comedy with unrealistic dream sequences. I was ready for some laughs. Did I laugh? Yes. Were there a few scenes with non-real drama going on? Yes. But was it also well written, well acted, and VERY well filmed? YES. This was a beautiful adventurous film. The trailer does NOT do this justice. And I think the title throws people off. The acting was superb. Loved the ending and just all the quirky little moments. The soundtrack was UNREAL. every piece of this puzzle was crafted together consciously and artistically. Powerful movie experience. Will be keeping an eye out for more Ben Stiller movies for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film - prerequisites are an open mind and an appreciation of life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Mild Spoilers*** Most of the reviews have touched on what makes this film such a fantastic film and also some that take it down a peg. I think the longeboarding scene is a litmus test of the type of person you truly are. My personal feeling is that if you watch the longboarding scene with wonder and joy than this will be a powerful film to you and easily a film that touches you. If not then this is probably not the film for you. Walter Mitty starts out slow and in this slow beginning there are many crucial details to pick up that make more sense as the film begins to pick up. The film truly comes alive as Walter plunges into the icy waters of the arctic. I can't help but think of it as a metaphorical plunge into the unknown, with salvation of one type or another as the only possible outcomes.As some have noted the daydreams go away mid-film. That is the point. As Walter begins to experience life in the truest sense he has no need for daydreams. I honestly felt that this is the entire point of the Film. Another reviewer stated that Walters real-life adventures are more entertaining than his day-dreams. To this I agree entirely. Walters life sequences are unrealistic, beautiful and captivating. There is no real possibility that they would happen and yet they are shot so beautifully that they are easy for US, the audience to have our own Walter Mitty day- dream moments. In those moments we think about and take stock of our life. I think that this is the real power of the film is to reflect on moments of the film. From the major scenes to the closing credits and their uniqueness. The credits and photography are the most beautiful I can remember seeing on film. Go into this film with an open mind and appreciation for life a you will leave with a sense of wonder, more perspective and joy than you entered with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An earnest and heartfelt story about self-discovery and living up to your potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY was one of many films that I was unable to see in theaters in 2013, and I was more than little worried given the rather lukewarm critical reception that it received. Thankfully, now having seen it, those fears have been assuaged. This film, while still a little overly earnest, is heartfelt and has a good message. And outside of the NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM movies, it's also one of the few films Ben Stiller has done that's appropriate for families. The story is about Walter Mitty who, in this film version, works for Life Magazine as a negative asset manager. Basically, he keeps track of all of the photographs that come in. As the magazine is in transition to becoming online only, a famous photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) sends in a roll for use in the final print issue. In particular, one negative (#25) is to be used as the cover. However, it's missing and Walter has to track it down and find it. This serves as the springboard for Walter, a rather insular fellow who tends to zone out and daydream, to get out and make something of his life. One thing I really liked about this movie was the way in which it seamlessly blended Walter's fantasies with the real world. They offered insight into an otherwise closed-off personality (at least in the beginning), and were realized visually in a very cool way. I also enjoyed the overall visual aesthetic of the film, which had lots of wintry blues, grays and whites. The characters were satisfactorily drawn, although none of them were terribly deep, save Walter. I thought Kristin Wiig gave a nice performance, but her character was never really given much to do other than be the object of Walter's affections. On the downside, for all of the buildup to a few things which I won't spoil here, the end result is a bit underwhelming. Still, the journey to the end (and to the discoveries found there) is an interesting one. This movie turned out to be much better than I expected. It's a fun film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you don't understand this movie, then you haven't figured out life yet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about connection. Connecting to the world, connecting to people, connecting to family, and, most importantly, connecting to yourself. Walter Mitty is a normal guy who, in his past, had all these ideas of who he would become. He had dreams of traveling and seeing the world, but life happened. He became what many people have become; a simple person, completely ordinary, having dreams that were never fulfilled. He was stuck in the rut of daily life. He needed a push, and it came in the form of a photographer who spiked his curiosity. In this curiosity, Walter Mitty decided to embark on a journey that, otherwise, he would not have taken. Most people need that push. Most people need a wake up call, and ALL people need connection. That moment when he took the long board down the streets in Iceland gave me chills. He finally connected to a part of himself that he had forgotten how much he loved. I loved the contrast of the eHarmony vs. real physical contact. That brings me back to where a smile connected one to another, not a mouse click on a website. You can comment on the acting, the lack of comedy, or the character flaws, but, in turn, you are missing the true message. This is an inspirational film that makes me want to embrace the joys of living. This life is all we have, so live it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is an adventure of your dreams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller stars and directs The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Its based on a shirt story with Stiller playing a mild mannered negative processor for Life magazine who tends to space out as he lapses into daydreams. He dreams of adventure as his real life is so mundane.When Life magazine is shutting down he cannot find a negative for the final issue from ace adventurer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn.) A jerk of an executive brought in for the final days of Life magazine makes fun of him as he strives to find the negative.In search for the lost negative he travels the world to Greenland, Iceland, Himalayas. He escapes from a Volcano, plays soccer with kids in Afghanistan and views a snow leopard. As his adventure increases his confidence grows and the daydreams lessen.The film kind of starts out slow, we have those heroic daydreams, we see that Mitty is a kind of dullard. Nice guy but a bit of a loser. Yet he seemed to be an interesting teenager, he used to skate. Wait he can skate, that surely would be a plot point later in the film!The film is rather jagged, Once it gets going it does flow well at the latter part of the movie. The location shooting in the Nordic countries help. You can kind of predict the ending. There are a few good cameos with Sean Penn standing out in his few scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real average film that will disappoint many</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was one of the most anticipated films of 2013 but I never got around to seeing it, but now I have seen this film I am glad I didn't waste my money going to the cinema to see this film. This film sees an average guy Walter who is as average as you like, with his and a colleague's job on the line he must step out of his comfort zone to attempt to save his job. Now Ben Stiller is a mixed bag with me but mostly I do like him, and I do like him in this film. He is nothing special in this film but he does a decent job in the lead, he does prove that some actors just cannot direct films he is in. The supporting cast is okay as well with Kristen Wiig delivering a good performance, but I am not sure if her and Stiller's chemistry not always being there. Also I thought that Adam Scott did a good job with what he was given but I did find him funny when he was on screen. Some of the other supporting characters aren't really utilised such as his mother and sister who could have added a lot to the film but were misused. The story is not great especially with the romance that just seemed immature and ridiculous, also the first half of this film is just so dull and bad. The end of this film was really good though and the last 20 mins had the right amount of heart in it to work. The script is okay with some of the dialogue being great between some of the characters but not all of it hits the audience where it should. The style of the film is okay as well with it shot well and the foreign scenes being impressive, however, some of the artistic ideas were stupid and really failed throughout the film. Overall this is an average film that is a big disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daydreaming and living</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a previous entry, I remember writing about the Oscars and how dramas tend to be the winners, almost like an amendment. The fact that such a film is not even nominated is quite sad. This is a statement of what Hollywood considers to be worth awarding. Drama? Yes. Comedy? No way. This is a loose remake of the same film directed by Norman Z. Mcleod in 1947, and an instant classic I reckon.Walter Mitty is a honest, simple man, and yes...a bit dull. He has a good job in the Life magazine, follows a routine of hard work and little or no fun at all, and no social life whatsoever. But you know how things work, most times it's all or nothing: suddenly a new girl starts to work in his company, a company that is about to be closed, and he accidentally loses the cover photo for that last issue.That's the a new life for Walter, just another one, so to speak...This project was associated to some top-notch stars of the industry: Steven Spielberg or Ron Howard behind the camera, and Will Ferrell or Owen Wilson as stars. Finally, it was Stiller who did helm it. Known as a brilliant comedian, Stiller is also a good director (Tropic Thunder, 2008 is just epic). He leads this story about daydreaming, living and not being paralyzed by fear; when you face the unknown, and dare to do the impossible, you just realize that in almost every case, impossible is just a word. it might take a lifetime to come to that conclusion, or it might never comes.I remember that after watching it, I felt so alive, so happy. Because drama and misery cannot be the only leitmotif in filmmaking. Sometimes the way you face life is great enough to be the plot of a beautiful and touching story. This one is, and I insist that these kinds of movies are more and more rare nowadays. So watch it, enjoy it and live, not because you only live once, but because there is only one life to live. Trust me, it's not the same meaning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walter Mitty, a middle aged man, who's earned a relatively successful career at Life magazine. He makes one decision outside of his comfort zone, and that sends him off on a life altering adventure. In this two-part adventure, he commits to changing his life to impress the girl. However, when that seems to have failed, he sets off on the second part of the adventure, this time for himself, which in turn gets him the girl after all.SLWM is an adaptation of a short story written by James Thurber's back in 1947. Walter Mitty is a dreamer who works at LIFE Magazine. Walter is dreaming about his life so much, that he forgets, or maybe because of his own Code of Interpersonal Communication, is unable to actually live his life. He zones in and out of reality, imagining what he wants rather than living what he wants. He is inept in any interpersonal communications. Throw in a crush on a girl, and his awkwardness is multiplied seven fold. We see glances into his personal Code when he first walks into the office and discovers that the physical magazine of Life was being replaced with an on-line version. Him and his co-workers are talking about the changes when he runs into his new boss. A cruel man, who is probably ten years the junior to Walter and his colleagues. His new boss quickly starts sucking in all the kiss- butting, and then teases Walter about the cake his sister brought him for his birthday. Walter is silent about the insult, but tries to stutter through what it is he does for the company as they all get on the elevator together. While on the elevator his boss continues to insult him, at which point, Walter goes into one of his daydreams where he get the upper hand by insulting his boss about his beard and being looked up to by his peers. "You know who looks good in a beard? Dumbledore, not you" (Walter-SLWM)I saw this as Walters Code. He seems to have an ideal that he needs to behave in a manner which is non-confrontational. Even when confrontation is clearly being thwarted at him, regardless of what he believes. Walter really takes the second principle of Interpersonal Communication very seriously. "You can't really take back something once it has been said. The effect must inevitably remain. Despite the instructions from a judge to a jury to "disregard that last statement the witness made," the lawyer knows that it can't help but make an impression on the jury." (Donnell King) This must be stifling for him, because the only way not to communicate is through isolation. I think we see this mentality growing in our world everyday. More and more people are isolating themselves, in order to avoid some sort of communication that may land them in danger.We are lucky to see the transformation in Walter during this film. He overcomes his shyness, and redefines his personal Code of Interpersonal Communication. Maybe at first he was doing it for the wrong reasons. Doing it for the girl, and not for himself. Possibly thinking, "Attentiveness is the gateway to empathy." (Herrington) However, in the end, finding his own personal strength for his own reasons leads him to a personal sense of peace, and confidence. Only then was he truly ready for a relationship with someone in the outside, real world.</fullReview>

Sometimes a not too complicated story allows you to enjoy some other strong points of the movie (in this case the awesome cinematography that helps you fully get into every moments of the story).8/10, a movie to watch for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's a little Walter Mitty in is all. This film was very heartwarming and fun and don't listen to the "experts" or critics on this one !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a little Mitty in us all !!! Review!I don't think many people understood this film and for that reason said it was horrible and not to see it. Well what I have to say to them is "Stupid"!!! . Walter is a regular guy that is like most people in the way he is an intelligent and a day dreamer. He "zones out" like all people at sometime or another do about adventures and a woman who he thinks is to far out of reach of his "normal" life . This film shows you that you can have an adventure and that you can push yourself beyond what you think is or is not inside of you. For all the dreamers out there who think that only day dreaming is the way of attaining something that in your heart you know that you, yourself can do. This being Ben Stillers first shot behind the lens (I believe) is a beautiful and misunderstood movie. It has a lot of dry humor and is a love story as much as an adventure story. The acting is great and the cinematography is beautiful in all the special places Walter visits and has his adventures in. I thought it was a heart warming and very fun movie which deserved better than the "experts" make you believe. Like I said "Everyone has a little Walter Mitty inside them whether they think so or not" and I believe that. I very much identified with this film and connected with it on a personal level. I gave it my own 8/10 for this reason and think it was a "Wonderful" film by a super talented actor in Stiller !!. That's my little review of "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" . Hope you enjoyed it but most of all enjoy the film. It's a lot of fun!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' is an unusual movie for sure. Definitely not your typical Ben Stiller comedy-of-embarrassment. Rather, this is a nice, uplifting film about a man reaching out to explore the natural wonders of life.The story is unfortunately rather shallow ; which makes it initially difficult to engage in. However, once the opening half hour or so passes , the movie becomes vibrant and interesting as Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller ) begins to explore the wonders of earth. The cinematography for this film is stunningly beautiful ; full of vibrant colour and magnificent scenery. The soundtrack is also wonderful ; the gentle 'humming' melody is perfect for this film.All in all I enjoyed watching this movie. It's nice to find a movie that doesn't thrive on violence or thrills but opens our eyes to the beauty of the world around us. It may not be perfect but 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' is nonetheless an inspirational movie that I would definitely watch again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We need movies like this. These days we have too many movies where the SFX drive the story rather than the script. It's obvious that a lot of work by a lot of talented story tellers went into creating this tale. There isn't a dull moment, the story moves quickly and every actor in every roll is spot on. It's a sweet story with exciting and comedic elements. Also, this is a great example of a family-oriented movie that isn't boring - another rarity these days. It seems that Hollywood has lost it's way but Walter Mitty gives me hope for the future. At first I resisted seeing the movie thinking that it was going to a lame recreation. Not so. It's one of the best movies I've seen all year. I so glad I watched the movie.</fullReview>

Of course there will always be some sort of imperfections but the story line, the acting and the cinematography will make up for those small mistakes.

		<fullReview>I was avoiding this movie because it seems like Catch Me If You Can but with Ben Stiller.... how wrong I was...This is one of the most beautiful movies ever! And let me tell you, I am a video producer and I am into action movies and sci-fi.

I felt like when I was a kid and saw the Empire of the Sun with my parents and I am 39 now.This movie has that hommy feeling, that nostalgia. The simplicity of the story. It is human. And it happened in a right time because like the character in the movie... I am working and working and no enjoining my life! The photography was so nice, the scenes could have been even longer. It was almost like watching that 80's movie "Never cry wolf"(Hollywood should make a remake of that one).This movie is not about finding yourself but discovering yourself.I am so happy Ben Stiller did this movie, a lovely legacy.

I have to say after watching this movie I thought to myself "I really enjoyed that" and felt uplifted by it's portrayal of an everyday person lifting himself up to do better things in his life. Don't over analyze but enjoy it for what it and you will well rewarded. Wonderfully acted by Ben Stiller, it's a return to the way old fashioned movies used to be before overtaken by special effects took over Hollywood and one that anyone with a heart and a dreams to will enjoy immensely</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Was OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller was very good in the title role. That's the first thing I'd say. From my perspective, it was one of his better performances. As Walter, he plays the head of the negative assets department for LIFE Magazine, which is about to publish its last print edition before becoming an online only magazine. In that position, Walter is responsible for a series of negatives from a hotshot photographer (who would ultimately be played by Sean Penn in little more than a cameo), one of which is to be the final cover photo. But one of the negatives (#25) is missing, and the movie revolves around Walter's wide-ranging search for it.Walter is a likable character. He's a guy who's largely bored and unsatisfied with life, who spends a lot of time daydreaming about what could be - some of his daydreams are realistic, others not so much. That sometimes gets a bit confusing, since it isn't always clear whether what we're watching is real or whether it's only happening in Walter's head. And as likable as Walter may be, I just didn't find myself caught up in the search for negative #25. It did give the movie the opportunity to go to some interesting places. You really don't see many movies that are set for significant periods of time in places like Iceland and Greenland - although whether those places were portrayed at all realistically is doubtful. Still ... Iceland and Greenland. But aside from the curiosity of the setting, the search for negative #25 rather bored me.There was also the problem of Ted Hendricks. Played by Adam Scott, Ted was the mean and nasty boss in charge of the transition from print to online, apparently delighting in telling people they would lose their job - heartless, callous and unfeeling. Yes, it happens, and the powers that be aren't always kind and compassionate, but Ted was too much of a caricature for my liking.This is certainly worth watching for Ben Stiller's performance, but for me at least the story left a lot to be desired.

		<fullReview>"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" includes a truly uplifting story and gives a push to everybody to live through their dreams instead of dreaming through their lives. If I had to pick my favorite component of the film, I'd probably go with the writing. However, I have to say that i also liked most of the performances. Stiller made a good job as the lead and so did Wiig. Adam Scott ("Parks and Recreation") was a good choice for the main antagonist to Mitty and he made slick really work. He really nailed his scenes, also the condescending way in which he treated the dreamer Walter Mitty.Maybe Walter's adventures were a bit too extreme or it felt a bit of a strange coincidence that Oswalt's character (always nice to see Patton, even if only in a small role and I did not recognize his voice, so it was even more of a delight when i saw him) always called him in the toughest of situations at the volcano or with the shark... It was a bit funny too though. That shark scene was a bit over-the-top for me. The stormy sea would have been already enough. Sean Penn has a small, but significant role too. For the most part of the movie, he only exists on a photo, but it fits nicely. Good casting decision here and I'm not sure somebody else could have worked that character so well. Sadly, I was not too big on the photo/wallet story, but anyway, the character was great too nonetheless. And was that missing photo (and the dismissals resulting from it) really reason enough realistically to trigger Mitty's adventurism. I'm not so sure. Or putting it together piece by piece, for example with that chunky drunken pilot? Well, maybe you should not really question the film in depth, but just enjoy it and its message for what it is.This movie offers many great symbolisms you will have to find for yourself though. I will just mention two, the camera from above that makes the office workers look like a swarm of ants or everything that involved sending a wink early on, some nice criticism to the online world here. Loved it. Watching it again, I would probably find even many more. Another thing I liked was that it ended before Mitty and Wiig's character start dating or become a couple as it really was not about romance, more about finding yourself and living that way. Everything else comes on its own afterward. The movie has some great music. The Major Tom scene was possibly my absolute highlight. It was a key moment in Mitty's life and at the same time obviously also for the whole movie. Sadly I must have missed the scene from the trailer when Mitty runs next to all these Life "Person of the Year" photos. Anyway, back to the music, apart from Major Tom I also liked the use of the song "Dirty Paws" by "Of Monsters and Men".There is actually another Walter Mitty movie based on the same story from 1947 and I have gotten curious. Maybe I will check this one out someday. Anyway, Stiller as a director and lead actor really knocks it out of the park once again, just like in Tropic Thunder. It is not too often the case for me that I rate films from the same director an 8, but here it is. I am curious about his next works behind the camera. I was wowed for the two hours that this film went on and I recommend it a lot. If you're lucky, this movie can become even a life-changing experience for you, depending on how much you can identify with the central character. You won't have to travel the world and fight sharks to make a crucial change though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that the idea behind this movie was fantastic. As soon as i saw the trailer, i was immediately determined to go see it as soon as i could. However, after seeing it i was a little disappointed. The potential i saw in it before just wasn't there and by the end of the movie, i was just sitting there craving more. Mainly, i expected the movie to be mainly action based. I liked that there was a bit of a romance and i liked how it really drove the action to take place but i think that they sacrificed too much of the adventure and action in order to develop the movie into more of a romantic adventure. I might just be me but i feel that when Ben Stiller directs a movie, it's always missing something. Don't get me wrong, i love Ben Stiller's style but i'm always left wanting more after seeing one of his movies. I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it but over all i think that the producers and directors missed out on an enormous opportunity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>as a fellow daydreamer I like the premise of this film, what I would have liked to have seen was more instances where drifting off tends to have real world implications, rather than it just being applied to social etiquette. the daydream sequences, while being humorously outlandish also served as a motivation for the lead character to act upon his dreams. parts of these I liked, they seem quite inspiring. I have to say, parts of this gave me a good chuckle. stiller often delivers lines or acts in such a way which can elicit this type of response which is frequently why he's stared in a lot of comedies, and although I don't see this film as a comedy in the usual sense, he does lend these characteristics to the film. also the ending I found incredibly touching. but there are moments which left me questioning the directors choices of what to include and what not to include and why. its those confusing moments which for me let the film down a little because there is a lot to take away from it that is very good and beautiful. on a personal note, i'd say out of all the films stiller has directed this is probably my favourite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give this film a 9 out of 10 rating. And i just watched it by now. i think this movie is so natural, it represent lot of normal people who dream big but never did really their dream. I think Walter Mitty just taught us how to be brave, how to break the line, how to get out from your comfort zone. And he did not realize that he is really the one who truly represent that spirit itself. And when he decided to travel to greenland, that is where he finally found his courage. And Walter Mitty is one of a person we should used as a profile.I think this is the one of Ben Stiller's best movie, nice job Mr. stiller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a charming, gorgeously filmed movie. In the days of special effects, it's great to see a movie that just uses beautiful scenery to inspire that feeling of awe. The cinema photography alone is worth the price of the movie. If that wasn't enough, the story is wonderful too, it's Ben Stiller at his best. The storyline is simple - Walter Mitty is a daydreamer. He zones out at times and we get to see what he is dreaming about - be it romance, action, a man that can conquer all. One day, those dreams and reality meet and he embarks on a journey that will change him forever and the reality is better than he imagined it would be. Great supporting cast as well - a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Journey from Dreams to Reality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally based on the classic story, "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" written by James Thurber in 1939. Director and lead actor Ben Stiller plays the role of a day-dreamer Walter Mitty who escapes his boring life by disappearing into his world of imagination, where he is capable of doing heroic work. But in real life he sees himself incapable and not qualified to do so. All this changes when he finds himself in a complicated situation where he seems to have lost the cover photo of Life Magazine and the only way out is to find Sean O'Connell, the lead photographer of the 'Life Magazine'. Then he gathers all his courage to go on the journey he has only dreamed of.The movie is one of the feel good stories and tells viewers to live life rather than just dreaming. With a serious message "Stop dreaming, Start living" it urges the viewers to fulfill their dreams. It is quite inspirational and catchy. With an ordinary man dreaming to be something but struggling to achieve that and in the end finding his courage to live his dream, it truly is a common man's story. The scenes captured in the film truly deserve a special mention. Skate-boarding in Iceland and climbing the Himalayas are very memorably shot with unique camera range and angles. Though written in late 40's, it distinguishes itself from modern movies.Ben Stiller is perfect to play Walter Mitty. Against most of his humorous movies he has done, this one has serious message but also succeeded to introduce some light and well placed funny moments. Kristen Wiig as Cheryl Melhoff, the lead actress and with stunning cinematography the movie is overall good. Overall, story is well written with very good screenplay. The cast is well chosen and apt for the roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie suffers from an unfortunate but inevitable side-effect of it's title. In these days of infarction-inducing, billion-dollar epics... if the title doesn't have some kind of hook to get viewers interested, most of us are just too busy watching other movies with what little time we do have to give this movie a second look. Only after all others have been seen (or by some happy and serendipitous accident) does this movie get the nod from most movie goers: "Let's rent this one, we've seen all these other ones." This is unfortunate because it is a visual, visceral, and inspirational movie experience. We absolutely loved it. I have 4 smaller children and even they "stayed tuned" throughout the entire flick. This movie is great for smaller-than-teen but bigger-than-baby age groups, by the way. It was inspiring for me and I'm almost too old to dream :) We actually discussed this film after watching it with them because they had so many questions: "Is there really a place in Iceland or Greenland or wherever that has only 8 people living there Dad?", and "I want a skateboard like that Dad. Its faster than the one I have." The only reason I gave it an 8 instead of the 10 it probably deserves is because the 10's must mean something and if you hand them out willy-nilly, they won't. This movie deserves an 8.5-9.5 for global visuals alone. Let's not forget the really funny parts we've come to expect from Scott and Stiller. There is no shortage of that in this film. Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This ranks as close to a "perfect ten" as you can get in my book.If you want to see the beauty of life and this world encapsulated in a movie, watch The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.I understand why it got mixed reviews. This particular type of film isn't for everyone. If you've never stared in wonder at an amazing photograph in National Geographic...or wanted to cry when you saw a fierce big cat in a cage...or thought the deep lines in an old woman's face were striking...then this movie may seem overly stylized to you. It is also surprisingly short on dialogue. I'm a wordsmith by trade and you'd think that would bother me. It didn't. The lines were perfect. They conveyed emotion without gimmick. (Hey, I love pieces that are all about the dialogue...Pulp Fiction, Before Sunset, anything with Robert Downey Jr in it...but you don't always need it.)Often a film can let you down at the end...I've reviewed a few, like Noah, that captured my interest but left me feeling dissatisfied when the credits began to roll. This movie was consistent...interesting, thinking, all the way through. Without giving anything away, the screenplay writer didn't seem to feel the need to resolve every little issue, or tie up things too neatly. My advice...avoid comparing to any other big fantastical story films like Big Fish. Try to judge this film on its own merits. The cinematography is incredible. It jives perfectly with the soundtrack. With quietly powerful performances by Stiller, Wiig, Penn, MacLaine, Martinez, this flick is engineered to touch your heart. Nothing wrong with that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A surprisingly good movie. Ben Stiller is a wonderful actor and this is a demonstration of his ability of pulling off movies that are not all comedic. I had no idea what would happen when each scene appeared. The concept of having him go to Greenland and getting caught up in a Volcano Eruption was amazing. The scene when he was sitting in a pub and the singer in the back wanted him to sing I thought that moments later he would be drunk and singing along with him but no the film went in an entirely different direction.The skateboarding scene was cool, Sean Penn was pretty slick in the film and it felt like the whole movie was an advertisement for visiting Mountains which is kind of bizarre in good way. The film had a moral to the story which was essentially don't treat employees like trash but all in all a very fun and entertaining escape from most other comedies and films that are very bland.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet story drowned out by too much CGI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) is a meek daydreamer working as the negative asset manager in Life magazine. He hasn't been anywhere noteworthy. He is infatuated with Cheryl Melhoff (Kristen Wiig) who joined Life a month ago. The problem is that he keeps spacing out as he daydreams. Life got taken over and Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott) is there to close down the magazine. Legendary photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) sends in a specific photo to be developed by Walter for the cover of the final issue. Only Walter can't find it and he goes off to find the unreachable Sean O'Connell. Also Shirley MacLaine and Kathryn Hahn play his mother and sister.There is a sweet likable story here. It strives to be poignant. Ben Stiller directed this ambitious film and he does a reasonable job. He just needs a few adjustments. Walter's daydreaming wore out its welcome as he and Ted do battle. Stiller is doing too much. That also goes for his trip to Greenland and Iceland. It's too outlandish. He is stuck with this idea of making his daydreams come alive. It would be so much more poignant for Walter to have real experiences. The Afganistan trip is still unreal but it feels more real than the rest of the movie. In that sense, it works better. The artificial nature of everything just strips away some of the real feeling. Just because there is advancements in CGI, it doesn't mean that it must be used.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Stiller is excellent in this film. His facial expressions, voice, and even his stature make character Walter Mitty feel like a real person and one we can relate to; a man afraid of living and taking chances. This is one of those films where you love to see an actor like Stiller, rather than a Brad Pitt. This film is visually beautiful and strange at times. It's quirky with some very odd scenes and characters throughout. This one didn't feel like a big Hollywood production to me. No nudity, no cussing, no crudeness, and no drinking/drug use; just a solid film with good acting, beautiful scenery, and a great and meaningful ending. Loved it.</fullReview>

Ben Stiller has done an excellent job in carving a character that many people can easily relate to though the portrayal through day dreaming and imagination is far fetched, it does clearly describe the aspiration and secret dreams of many individuals who see themselves as heroes.The Movie has perfectly captured the role of his supporting cast and the beautiful locales in achieving its objective.

		<shortDescription>Not really "Walter Mitty"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read the short story "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" by James Thurber where a bored suburban husband imagines a fantasy-world while waiting outside a beauty parlor for his domineering wife. It's a clever and cute story about how we are legends in our own minds, how we all think how noble &amp; chivalrous we'd be when placed in heroic situations, etc. In the short story, we quickly figure out that it's all in this mild-mannered character's head, that none of the actions he imagines is real. The movie "Walter Mitty" starts off in a very similar manner: a meek man imagines scenarios where he is the hero, performs valiantly in dangerous situations, then snaps out of the fantasy world and back to reality. Eventually, he finds himself in a real-life scenario where he starts behaving fearlessly to any and all dangers. What's weird is that, in the story, we know that the Walter Mitty character is dreaming up all these wild situations. In the movie version, once he starts off on his quest, all the events are actually happening to him. Readers expect him to snap back into reality, but in the film the scenarios are really happening to him, he's *not* living this within the confines of his mind. For that, the film should have been called something like "The Secret Life of Ryan Johnson" or "Adventures in LIFE", and not titled from a very well-known work of fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is the epic adventure we all find ourselves waiting for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Mitty is a middle aged, single man, played by Ben Stiller, who's played by the books his entire life. He seems to have a very bland life (in the very first scene he is balancing his checkbook) and although he's exceptionally good at his job, he hasn't put much time into doing anything else throughout his life besides taking care of his mother and sister. One day he overhears a woman at his work talking about an online dating service and signs up for the same website in a "pina colada" type attempt to meet her. When asked to fill in his profile he realizes he hasn't really done much throughout his life and his story is rather boring. Meanwhile, at work an important picture is missing - the picture to be on the final cover of LIFE magazine. The next hour is Walter chasing down the photographer throughout various countries in an attempt to locate the films negative all the while incidentally building his online dating profile.The beauty in this narrative is that Walter sets off on an adventure for work related reasons but along the way he finds himself. When it's over he's a completely different person. It makes us wonder if we have indeed truly know our own selves. The breathtaking landscapes in Greenland, Iceland, and Afghanistan serve as a stunning backdrop throughout a majority of the film. Kristen Wiig is very charming and Stiller, who also directed the film, does a fantastic job at being relatable. Who hasn't caught themselves fantasizing about the way we wish certain events in our lives will work out or wondering where we'd end up if we just hopped on a plane, all while sitting in our office? The style of this film is also particularly noteworthy in my opinion. All of the strategic right angle placements, extreme long shots, and longer takes combined with the perfectly selected and harmonious Space Oddity make you feel like you've somehow time warped yourself somewhere in between fantasy and reality. My only regret is waiting to see this movie on DVD because I know it would have been even more stunning and effective on the big screen in theaters. I would definitely recommend this movie. If not for the aesthetics then for the reminder that we all need a little adventure in our lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller), a photo negative asset manager for the Life magazine for more than 15 years. In his position, Walter builds a good work relationship with Life's main photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn). But because of the nature of Sean's work, they never actually meet in person. Also, due to the rapid expansion of the digital media, Life is bleeding out printed sales and thus been acquired buy another company that wants to transition totally to the digital format of Life Online.At the same time, Walter have some personality issue, he is too shy to make a move on his co-worker Cheryl Melhoff. In the transition time, It's decided that the next issue will be Life's last issue. The transition management wishes to honor Sean's request that the final cover uses the Negative Number 25, his so-called "Quintessence of Life", which Walter fail to find on the delivery package.The story builds up pretty fast for a 1,5 hour movie. The start with Cheryl Melhoff's online dating profile page was a confusing one for a start, but it then picks up later on. This movie has a main catch, Walter often has this moment of "zoned-out" when he suddenly daydreams and retracts to his own wild imaginations. These imaginations are hyperbolic and makes Walter to be some kind of an action hero in his own thoughts. Walter then gets zapped back in to reality often in embarrassing situations.The movie plays well with visuals. It uses vivid difference in color contrasting in portraying Walter's Life in clear distinction between office moments and out of office moments. Also, as the movie progresses, Walter develops his character to live his adventures and not just enjoys them solely in his daydreams. This transition is pictured well by differentiating the daydreams and the real adventures by using hyperbolas on the daydreams.These hyperbolas are the only difference to the real adventures because both "action" sequences rolls through seamlessly on the movie.One other thing that can differentiate them is maybe the timing, that is the daydreams are concentrated mainly on the early moments of the movie while the real adventures are concentrated on the later moments.The twist of the wallet is also nice. It makes me remember one similar twist I read on the book "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho. The difference is that Walter didn't have to travel all the way back to find his real treasure.Overall, the movie is good. It serves you the journey of Walter's character transformation. Though it is different from the usual Ben Stiller's comedy range, but it still suffice for this one, yet still being not that heavy. a 7.5 of 10 is my score for this flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the best movie that I've seen for a long time.I enjoy to watch his movies but I would never expect such a masterpiece from Ben Stiller , it was beautiful to watch, I couldn't bear to miss a second.Shirley MacLaine, Kristen Wiig, Sean Penn, Kathryn Hahn ... Scenes,songs,acting... So beautiful to make me write my first IMDb review with my poor English ^^Only one scene that didn't fit to the wholeness in my opinion, the last conversation with the boss, but it was nothing.I really really loved the movie..Thank you Ben Stiller for such a great work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is the next in a long line of movies given to big name actors and/or producers, where the production values and all the technical aspects are great because they have enough pull and capital to hire the best people, but where not enough thought is given to the story to make it the best one possible.The film starts out slow and abysmal. Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) is a complete harebrained idiot with the attention span of a sleepy squirrel and the tendency to wander off into his own little fantasy worlds. You can see that the film makers were going for the sympathetic everyday awkward guy, but the end result is so out of the norm, so shared sense of shame inducing and so bizarrely out of it that you cannot really get behind him. Sure you feel bad when he's picked on, but he's such a weird guy that you sort of get the sense that the pickers don't do it out of malice, rather they're just as baffled by him as you are.It gets better, fortunately. As soon as Mitty sets out on his journey the film gets much more interesting, his character loses much of the unbearable spaciness and the film's budget really starts to show. You'll get the world-scoping adventure you've seen in the trailers, you just have to wait for it. And it's not a bad adventure. Multiple locations, all breathtakingly beautiful, some good character moments, good conversation, some action, close situations, even closer calls and as a whole it's a lot of fun.I think this film's biggest problem is that it was marketed as the next Forrest Gump. It's not. It doesn't even try to be. It has some of the same themes, and I suppose the main characters can be labeled similarly if one is so inclined, but it is its own creation. If you're going in expecting to see a warmhearted social commentary/adventure comedy featuring a simple soul in the main role, you're going to be disappointed. It is a warmhearted adventure comedy, but that's where the similarities end.This film has its problems. The beginning is not very good, the characters get better towards the end, but they start out pretty boring and even the timeline is too tight for the plot to make much sense given that the main idea of this film is for the main character to travel and see the world. But it has some gorgeous imagery, it DOES get better towards the end and it has a good message. It evens out to an average score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't stop following your dreams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We explore Walter Mitty's boring and struggling life. The 'Dream Boy' changes his life while going on an adventure after he loses a negative from his office. He finds his answers in the most unlikely places of all. He discovers what his life had been till the journey and what his life will be after the journey that changes his life. The movie gives a way one message : Never give up your hopes. Don't stop following your dreams and enjoy tour life. Walter Mitty shows us what we can make out of our life. Ben Stiller moves out from his typical comfort zone, doing comedy roles and gets much serious. A true inspiration every film lover should watch.</fullReview>

Just rented this movie from the local library mostly curious how it would compare to the original version with Danny Kaye...Husband,(always the critical skeptic when watching remakes,especially), and I loved this so much,that we both got the tissues out after watching this....BEN? This is one,if not THE Best movie you have ever made or been in,,in our humble opinion..Can't wait to find it for sale and buy this for our (Gotta Watch It Again)collection!! We wish there were more well made movies like this,instead of all the downer,blood,guts,hate and gore offerings of the day....love a good mystery/thriller,but sometimes just way over the top..and this is the kind of movie to put your heart in the right place again,,assuming of course,you actually do have a 'heart'..:)The cinematography was perfect I thought,,in capturing scenic's and action dynamics. Loved Kristin bit in the bar,,maybe she should put a band together,??? Assuming she was not v/o'd. (voice-over)All the players were perfectly cast,we felt..and always a joy to be pleasantly surprised by their roles! Loved the added graphics f/x,,very poignant...okay,I just loved everything about this movie!! A '10 BIG Thumbs up'!!! 7-4-14</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to begin, well I know I'm late to the party after only just finishing the film months after it being released but there was something about it that has caused me to sign up and type this review for you.The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, This film can be described in many different ways, funny, moving, touching, inspiring are just a few words that come to mind which sum the movie up. This may seem like bland information but to truly understand the roller-coaster I went on during this movie makes it very difficult to describe it to you, you would have to watch it yourself. But I will try my hardest to give you the how this film was portrayed in my eyes!Walter is a man who will make you see things differently, he has a unique way of showing what he is thinking and this gives you a great insight to his thoughts and feelings but sadly he doesn't seem to be brave enough to make come true. This makes me sympathise with him. This is where the roller-coaster begins. Walter seems semi content with his life but you can tell he wants more and after a while we get to see him chase after that thing he has been missing in his life when he is forced on an adventure I won't say why, but on this adventure our minds and hearts are played with as we grow closer to the character and the film in general. We start to really see that Behind all of the hilarious jokes, puns and some form of funny stereotypes that this movie really has a proper meaning to it, this meaning was described perfectly in the film when one character is describing what David Bowies song "space oddity." Is to her. She not only described the meaning of the song well but that meaning also transferred over to what this film meant to me, that was that it was about courage. Now courage can come in many different forms but to me this filmed told me not to be scared to leave my comfort zone and to do whatever it takes to be happy and Walter Mitty truly did this, he left his shell and went on a journey that will stay with him forever and has lead him to a new, happier life. This movie really made me smile and honestly I think it would make you smile too, although the movie may not appeal to your taste, it will certain grasp you in some form or an other and that's the beauty, it can relate to everyone. I thank everyone who worked on this film, it's a real eye opener to what can be achieved if the true desire and meaning is there!Thanks for reading this, it was my first review. Matthew.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie equivalent of a quality at-bat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stiller's film adaptation of the middle school staple Thurber story is one of those movies where you leave fully understanding where he was going with it. His quirky intense weirdness that worked so well in "Zoolander" and "Tropic Thunder" comes off more off-putting here more similar to "Dodgeball" or "The Cable Guy". Stiller's Mitty takes his dying job of physical photographic negative wrangler super-intensely and he is prepared to go down with the sinking "Life Magazine" ship. In a great piece of casting, Sean Penn plays his superstar photographer benefactor. Penn is supposed to be the catalyst to draw Mitty out of his dreaming and into some doing. However, we never really doubt Mitty will make the leap so the dramatic tension is low. We also know Life Magazine eventually went out of print so no surprises there. The nostalgia that permeates the writing and the message that life should be lived in the real life rather than on-line as a silicon chip and copper wire extension of human imagination are good but not particularly powerfully conveyed. Also, the run-time could have be shaved back to create a tighter narrative. In short, nicely done but not powerfully so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>review of beginning-only</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is creative and so far I like it. I wanted to post this where the writer would see it.There is an historical inconsistency in the beginning. Life Magazine (which I used to enjoy for the photographs) went out of business in 1972. Dumbledore did not first appear in J.K. Rowling's novel until 1997. "Walter" tells a guy in the elevator "beards look good on Dumbledore, not on you" then he walks into the Life Magazine office, which is being bought by a dot.com. But there was no world wide web in 1972, that was before there was any Windows, or personal computers. The reference to being bought by a dot.com in what is suggested to be the early 70s also is a plot failure. There should be some link between late 60s to early 70s attire, graphics and the dot.com boom, which occurred 20 years later, but there isn't. So we are asked to file this inconsistency away and keep watching. The voices he does, the special effects that sprout out of situational remarks is funny, a bit Woody Allen, but original in form.The reminder that "film" was once sacred to photographers (blood stained and sent with a handwritten note) is good. I'll keep watching and perhaps I can update later.I did not check the spoiler box because I have not seen the plot yet, we know from the summary that "Walter Mitty" is a day dreamer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually wanted to see a comedy, since Ben Stiller was in it, but it turned out to be a drama. Nonetheless I'm not at all disappointed, I very much liked the content, full of unexpected turns and beautiful, surprising images of icy, remote places - who could've thought that, when starting to watch the film. The funny bits are there too, to be correct. The plot, camera-work and acting all make it a very watchable piece. Ben Stiller plays a guy, many can relate to or have the same experience. However, his story has a happy ending. Some places stretch the imagination, but this is not really a problem, since a large share movies do that, most from start to finish, but in this case the first part was really credible, detailing the main characters' issues. The latter is done with humor - always a good way to solve all problems one can have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular and Inspiring But Doesn't Reach It's Potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More of an original than a film version of the short story, the Secret Life of Walter Mitty has some great points but in the end does not reach the potential that it started with. Perhaps that is a little ironic because The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is about Walter reaching his potential to find greatness and excitement in his life. At times the story was not engaging enough and had a thrown together feeling, and that may be attributed to Stiller both acting and directing in this one. All the same the film should inspire many to take charge of their lives and do the interesting things they fantasize about. The cinematography captures the epic grandeur of stunning places like Iceland and the Himalayas and should rekindle your sense of adventure. During Walter's travels, you will also see how his journey is not just point A to point B, but also one of personal discovery and finding his true self. We start out seeing him as a meek office worker but by the end you will realize how large his contribution to his family and work have been. And that is a really beautiful thing about this film. It might make you see how much you have given to life, and show you it's possible to do the things you have always dreamed about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a super Stiller fan, but would say I've enjoyed most of the movies he's been in over the years. I was particularly excited to see this film because it seemed like Ben Stiller was taking on a somewhat different role than usual.Unfortunately, this movie was so lackluster and dragging that I had a hard time watching it, and I don't mean content-wise. The movie was visually stunning and when it could keep my attention long enough, it was even cheeky and creative. It almost hurts me how much I am unable to enjoy this movie at all. But something about the way the whole story is presented is off-putting. Maybe it's that Stiller is almost unbelievable as a soft-spoken, introverted bloke. Maybe it's how obvious a lot of the product placements are. Maybe it's that Kristen Wiig's character almost felt like a more realistic version of her character in Anchorman 2, or that her and Stiller's relationship had very little development, leaving me generally disinterested in what was going to happen to it.I wish I could pinpoint what made this movie so mind-numbingly boring to me, but I really can't. All I can conclude is that, while visually appealing at times, it was a huge disappointment because of an overall lack of development among the plot, characters, and relationships.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, but pleasant, light, and will leave you feeling a little inspired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit I was hoping for a bit more from The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. The trailers made it out to be one of those potentially life-changing drama/comedies that can leave you on a real high when they hit the mark (I'm thinking Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Good Will Hunting, Up in the Air etc.).TSLOWM comes close, but doesn't quite make it. It's more like, let's say, The Truman Show or Miss Pettigrew lives for a day, in that it's a perfectly good way to kill two hours but it might also frustrate you because it could have been much better with just a little tweaking. Mitty's character arc, from daydreamer to life-liver isn't as clever or as subtle as it could have been. His moments of realization aren't quite as high on the emotional scale as they should be. Also the romance between Stiller and Wiig could have been a lot more exciting, it seemed as if they were always going to get together without question - there was very little anticipation or sexual tension involved.Gripes aside, it's a beautiful looking movie, full of scenic landscapes and nice transitions. And it's got a good heart and a sensible core message, so unless you're a pessimist of the highest order it should at least leave you feeling a little happier and more inspired than before you watched it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie in very inspiring. And to get of our boring life and do what we really love to do. To explore the world and discover our boundaries. The character of Sean O'Connell represents the mysterious joy of life that all humans seek in their life. The Walter Mitty, on the other hand, represents our coward characteristic that afraid of living the life in a more fun way! The move has a good flow by flashing back multiple times; it never let you get bored! The music is very pleasing. The camera angel is very well chosen and transfers the perfect view. !!!Spoiler alert!!!: the last scene has an equal weight to the rest of the movie where Walter meet the Sean. It kills you at the end when Sean says "Beautiful things don't seek attention." after he avoid capturing a shot he has been waiting for a very long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen this yet, many of the posts here that point out some script issues are accurate, but the issues are overshadowed by the things that work and the gorgeous cinematography.Here's where I may offer up the slight spoiler: If you watch this avoiding getting caught up the expectations of the trite Hollywood plots. 1) This is not the story of a helpless loner who learns to overcome fear and take a chance. Actually, he is a pretty interesting guy with some adversity and meaningful backstory even if it is not thoroughly developed. (This is regarding only the 2013 version.) 2) Don't get hung up on the evil corporate jerk vs. the "everyman" at the downhome company storyline. It is relevant, but not essential to the story, at least not the standoff between the two characters.If you can get past those temptations there is a really beautiful, pertinent story here. It has everything to do with the ongoing Life double-entendre and the encounter. It has more to do with Andy Warhol than Don Quixote. I won't go into much more than that. That would be too much of a spoiler.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the mainstream critics had me believe it was...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I was sold on the trailer, I was a little hesitant to see this film because the main consensus with the main stream critics was the film was kinda "meh." However, after some friends recommended that I don't listen to them and that the film is pretty good, I sat down and found I really enjoyed "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty." While the film won't be a life-defining film for me, I really enjoyed the story, the cast and the humor of it. Ben Stiller directed and acted in a movie that really captured the human spirit and the drive to create lasting memories and weave a life full of awe and wonder. I really enjoyed how the film was able to feel larger-than-life with the fantasy/dream sequences that led to the real adventures Walter goes through but, at the same time, feel small and personal as Walter not only comes to know himself but better understand those around him.Finally, while the movie may not have been laugh-out-loud hilarious, I still thought the movie was very amusing. For example, Walter's interaction with the eHarmony tech Todd (Patton Oswalt) never failed to make me chuckle and smile and the film also has a couple of moments where they set up a joke very early in the film (like right at the beginning) and deliver the punchline at the very end. Instances like that are just great examples of patience and payoff.While the reviews are mixed, I definitely thought "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" was better than the "Reception" tab on Wikipedia would have led me to believe. The movie is amusing, has heart to it without getting too sappy, and the cast all does their job tremendously.Greetings!

		<fullReview>Socially awkward daydreamer, Walter Mitty lives in a world that has very little in common with his actual surroundings. The tedious daily routine made him escape into a more bearable world of imagination where he sees himself a hero, a complete opposite of who he actually is. All this starts to change when a missing photograph sets him on an adventure of his life. Bullied by his boss, Walter decides to embark on a trip to Greenland continuing to Iceland and all the way to the mountains of Afghanistan in search for a photographer whose photo, "frame 25", got misplaced. During his voyage, Walter gradually embraces the world that surrounds him, slowly replacing his daydreaming with real world adventures and thrills. Ben Stiller, who plays Walter, is as charming as ever. His small stature and generally funny features make him a fitting actor to play the role of Walter. Supporting cast are all up to the challenge. Even though most of them are very famous actors and actresses, not for a second does it feel they take over the focus. The story of the movie is centered around a missing photograph, appropriately so since the movie is brimming with stunning photographic treasures. Masterfully executed scene transitions and gorgeous vistas of nature from Greenland, Iceland and mountains of a place that is a stand in for Afghanistan are simply breathtaking. This movie will make you feel good. It is worth the spent time and money. I enjoyed it very much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The rare case of a maligned remake, a long-term denizen of development hell, which seems to have benefited from the extended incubation. The offbeat saga of a chronic introvert, so conflicted he debates the merits of a single mouse click, it thrives on his spirited imagination and the audience's uncertainty about where the line stretches between stark reality and vibrant make-believe. These scenes, peppered with equal amounts of breakneck effects magic and surprising, effective laughs, are the heart and soul of the movie. Not only do they keep the pace skipping along at a frantic speed, but they also effectively foreshadow upcoming events, convey Walter's wants and needs, and chart his progress on the road to self-discovery. Ben Stiller is wonderful in the leading role, both as a mousey, zoned-out ghost at the journey's outset and the large, confident individual he becomes, and the awkward chemistry he shares with Kristen Wiig is just right. My sole complaint, really, is that after handling so much in the opening acts, it feels stuck during the slower-paced home stretch. Intelligent, thoughtful, entertaining adventures - both real and imagined - with a beating heart and a fresh sense of style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I think of those great adventure films, I think of Life Of Pi and Big Fish. In those films I was not only blown away by the visuals but was emotionally moved to the core in each. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty has a good message but never takes me out of just a normal movie going experience and into something special. The trailers were mesmerizing and I thought it may be a movie to compete with Gravity and 12 Years a Slave for best picture. It results in a fun and adventurous ride, but doesn't do much else.Ben Stiller is perfect as the day dreamer who has never done anything that important in life but gets stuck in this case of Sean Oconnel and what he wants the last cover of Life Magazine to be. I have to say the movie takes just a bit too long to actually reach the adventure parts. But I did really like Kristen Wiig, and I can understand why Walter Mitty cant get his mind off of her. But on the other hand, Adam Scott's character is unrealistic. He comes off as a grade school bully, rather than some sort of business world jerk.Even though the point of the movie was to get Walter out in the real world by himself and realize his worth to others, there was a part of me that wished Cheryl would have gone with him. I feel if they would have made this movie more of a complete romance to go along with an adventure, it may have helped hit those emotional highs and lows I was looking for. For Ben Stiller its a good directorial effort and its something to be proud of because the movie looks fantastic. Like I said the visuals are top notch but thats the only aspect of the movie that was an A+.I would recommend waiting until this one is on cable, but make sure your watching the HD version, because it is a true spectacle. +tremendous visuals+Kristen Wiig-not what the trailers promised-would have liked more romance/emotional appeal7.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An attempt to be complex turns out very simple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wasn't sure what to expect when the decision arose to watch this movie. I went into it hoping that the writing would be thought provoking enough to allow for more enjoyment than what I had only seen in the trailers. Not so. The story had interesting undertones to it, but the main story just kind of led you to believe it might get interesting at some point. Not so. I think the struggle was to try and decide whether or not that it was going to be more comedy than drama or vice versa. Therefore the scenes where comedy was attempted, just were not that funny. The best part of the movie was the cameo appearances, and even those were obviously influenced by who knows who, and not the quality of the script. The direction jumped around too much, and often without necessary relevance. The ending kind of made you say, "Huh?" However, ultimately, it really doesn't push any boundaries of imagination, thought, or even production quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Decent movie. Glad I saw it. I especially liked the way it was adapted to modern life, with cell phones and internet playing central roles. Great soundtrack. I loved the ending.But it was still kind of disappointing. It required me to suspend too much disbelief. Some of Walter's adventures were just impossible, especially in the supposed time frame. More importantly, Walter's character transformation just wasn't believable. It came out of nowhere. Maybe it would've been a bit more believable if he had shown us more flashes of adventurousness in the first few minutes. All of that said, I still recommend the movie regardless of whether you read or liked Thurber's original short story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to watch this movie but 10 minutes in I realised it's not what I expected. To be honest I could barely keep my eyes open as nothing exciting happened throughout the movie.I couldn't make any relation to any characters,and even the plot did not make much sense or purpose. Maybe it's me who doesn't understand the concept but I did quite well with Forrest Gump-as some critics compared this to Zemeckis' epic-but it's an insult to one of the greatest movie that ever made. Even if you are a die hard Ben Stiller fan you won't get what you expect.This "let's try something different" approach worked for Jim Carrey-Truman show-sadly didn't here...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to see this movie for a long time, but it was rented every day at my local DVD-store. Finally I got it today and it was worth watching. This movie is shot very, very beautiful. The story has a deeper meaning. Acting isn't very great, but the story makes that up easily. The movie is funny, touching and I as a viewer wanted to know what was behind the story. That was making me watch the whole movie. Seeing a man chasing his dreams and finally becoming his dreams was wonderful. I can only say well done Stiller, best movie of yours made 'till now. I can only applaud such serious movies that can move your feelings. Some moments were a little bit dull, and that was a shame. Still very good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>strongly disagree with the critics here, this movie is seriously good. Walter Mitty is a mediocre man who sometimes confuses real life with a fictional world produced by his imagination and secretly in love with a coworker is suddenly shaken by the recent acquisition of the magazine he works for (LIFE). after losing the potential cover for the final issue his life takes a sharp turn and he sets out to find the photographer who took it. the movie recollects his adventures as he wanders around the world in a calm, spectacular and quite touching way. the movie is obviously not a silly comedy and never intended to be. there clearly are some exaggerations such as the volcano escape but in the context of the movie they get diminished and absorbed by the flow of the story which keeps a steady pace and doesn't let boredom set in. it's a light, funny, inspirational and creative movie, despite some flaws it's thoroughly enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite a wonderful heart and the best intentions, Ben Stiller's "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" adaptation can't quite elevate itself beyond "pretty good."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something to be said for the directorial efforts of Ben Stiller. He is a very capable visual storyteller, who is able to explore different tones, styles and genres with style and competence. Even though there have been hiccups here and there ("The Cable Guy" garnering mixed "love- it-or-hate-it" response, for example), he's got great talent behind the camera, in addition to his obvious talent in front of the camera.So I went into his adaptation of "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" fairly open, with the expectations of seeing a potentially great film. Was it great? Well, no, unfortunately. But was it good? Yes, most certainly it was.Stiller directs this feature, and stars as the titular Walter Mitty, a socially awkward man working for Life magazine who feels his life is of no note or consequence. He spends his time daydreaming while "zoning out", having grand fantasies about all of the things he wishes he could do- be a suave foreign lover, be a romanticized hero like those from the movies, save lives, etc... He constantly dreams up wonderful situations that he wishes he could live out. He is also quite smitten with a co-worker named Cheryl (Kristen Wiig), though he hasn't worked up the courage to ask her out yet.After discovering that the magazine is being shut down to go exclusively online (which will cause many workers to lose their jobs), and realizing that he apparently never received the film negative for the intended cover-image of the last issue, Walter is forced to overcome his demons. He finally breaks his silence and befriends Cheryl, and then proceeds to go on a true adventure of his own, just like the ones he imagined, as he tries to track down the photographer who took the photo he cannot find, and figure out where it went.The cast here is wonderful. Stiller is absolutely perfect for the Walter Mitty character, and he does a great job showing not only the various sides of the Mitty character, but his personal growth throughout the film. Wiig is absolutely charming as Cheryl, and gives the role an absolutely immense likability, even though it isn't very well developed beyond a basic "love interest." Supporting roles by the likes of Shirley MacLaine, Sean Penn, Patton Oswalt, Adam Scott and Adrian Martinez are similarly very well played. I particularly enjoyed the roles of Oswalt and Martinez. Oswalt plays an eHarmony customer service representative working with Walter to make his online dating profile more palatable, and he is a lot of fun to watch. And he almost becomes a sort-of makeshift "map" for the audience, as their continued phonecalls show how much Walter is growing as a character. And Martinez, despite having one of the smaller roles in the film, is a bit of a blast as Walter's understudy. Martinez has been getting more and more roles lately, and I'm quite glad. He's a very talented actor and it's nice to see him getting more recognition.The production is also fantastic for the most part. Stiller's direction is completely captivating and very, very cool. This is problem his most well put-together film from the standpoint of visual storytelling. The cinematography is just plain gorgeous. It was some of the best image- work I've seen in a film in the last few years. The visual effects are spellbinding and really bring to life the situation. Especially Walter's fantasy sequences. And the musical score, costume design and set design are top-notch. Really just a phenomenal film production- wise.That praise all being said, this film does have some serious flaws that hold it back. And it's quite sad, because this film has so much going for it, that it could have been flawless with just a little bit more work.I think the biggest problems here are some issues I have with the script, some very weird hit-and-miss jokes, and a few scenes that try too hard to have a "quirky" and "indie" sensibility that backfires.The script by Steve Conrad is very tight and well-paced, but I don't think it's clear enough, or focused enough, and there are many moments that feel contrived and confusing as a result. The handling of the material left me confused for a while, and was probably my biggest issue with the script. Especially when Walter leaves to go on his own real- life journey. I spent 20 minutes unsure if I was watching something "real" or just another of Walter's day-dreams. (It didn't help that his daydreams were constantly leaking in, thus making it more confusing to figure out what was happening.) I also felt that many characters were under-developed, including Wiig's love interest, which made them seem somewhat flat.Some of the jokes also rubbed me the wrong way. I can't say exactly why, but sequences like the eerie "Benjamin Button" reference joke felt dated, contrived and just too "out-there" even for this film. And I do think that the film had a slight issue with trying to be too "quirky" and "indie" in nature during some scenes. It's become popular lately to emulate the cliché "indie-style", and it almost always feels inorganic and forced.But those issues being said, I still think "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is a fundamentally solid film. It just sadly is never able to quite elevate itself beyond the level of "pretty good", even though it clearly aspires to be something great and something special.I give it a 7 out of 10. It's well-worth checking out. Just don't expect a cinematic revelation... merely expect a pleasant little film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just a flat-out enjoyable movie. Of course Stiller has mastered the role of a self-effacing mensch. What I found most surprising was the pure sweetness of it all. The cinematography was awesome, with truly magnificent views of Greenland's and Iceland's countryside. Likewise,the special effects - which is what I fully expected the whole movie to be about (but not even close) - were sensational. Shirley MacLaine was a hoot - as always. And Kristen Wiig was perfect. She also surprised me with her singing - made me think a woman will be releasing a similar version soon. The other surprise for me was what a fine movie it actually was. My local on-demand service has it coming in with a really lousy rating. Not sure why...but might have something to do with people thinking it too unbelievable. Me? I had a wonderful time simply allowing myself to dream - much like dear old Walter Mitty, who, goes through quite an interesting transformation through the course of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day Tripping the Life: Fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are craving to have your artistic soul fed, this is the movie for you. Moving at a slower pace with an attention to detail, this movie is not for the adrenaline junkie. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, takes you on a journey with an average man with plain Jane friends. Walter Mitty, a negative assets manager at Life magazine, is a middle age man that lives a routine and mundane life. He lives his life vicariously through the adventures of his photographer friend, Sean O'Connell. Sean is a free spirit who lands in far away places to document life. The negatives (how pictures used to be shot, as my young son would say, in the olden days) are then sent to Walter for review.Loosely based on current events, Life magazine makes a monumental decision to stop printing their magazine and go web only. With this comes a whole set of complications at work. Walter is put in charge of frame 25, from a negative that was shot by the famous Sean O'Connell. When frame 25 cannot be located, that is when all hell breaks loose. Walter is unable to find it, so his journey begins. Walter travels to Iceland, Greenland, on a shipping vessel, and through the Middle East on his quest for negative 25. As he travels, work is putting pressure on him to find this missing negative. His new boss harasses him regarding his recent travels.Walter suffers from elaborate daydreams that take him away from the moment. His daydreams are action packed, where he is the hero and says all the right words. In real life, Walter is slightly plain and not able to say any of the right words at the right time, which is very awkward.As Walter travels across the world and finds himself, the daydreams begin to slip away. He gains self-confidence and a new appreciation for life. I know that this sounds like a million other movies out there, but Ben Stiller does a superb job conveying the simplicity of making a change in your life. I would say that this movie is geared to a middle age crowd, some one who has been in their job for a bit and is feeling the dullness of life.The music is beautiful and perfectly placed with the story line. This is a soundtrack that you will want to buy after watching this film. It is music that is comforting and uplifting, not over bearing. The lyrics of each song are perfectly placed with the scene that it is accompanied with. The costumes are current with every day clothes and make up. The director does a great job conveying Walter Mitty's simple lifestyle. Right down to his apartment being styled in the way a man who lives a routine life would be. This is counter balanced with the apartment of his Mom, who is featured a couple of times. Her place is fun, full of color and memories that she shares with Walter and his sister.The Secret Life of Walter Mitty left me feeling thoughtful about my own life. It caused me to reflect on my own life and what a contrast it is to the life portrayed in the movie. I love adventure and I started to daydream about all the places I want to travel and explore. If only I had a mystery to solve while doing it. Can I please have a perfectly timed and lovely sounding soundtrack to my every day life? This movie is lovely and full of humor. A must watch. 8 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful portray of a simple yet very important element of life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bravery is one of the crucial element of Life, which many of us are missing nowadays. Basically, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (TSLOWM) is about a "lost" person finding his bravery, but unlike many other movies which only incorporate the work and love layer of the protagonist, TSLOWM brings him out into the REAL plain planet Earth. Although the protagonist going on a little adventure might sound dull, the movie producer actually gave us the chance to see the plain beautiful Earth in the eye of the protagonist as if we are actually there on top of a mountain, deep in the ocean, tip of a corner on this planet and down in the valley with him. The color and tone of this movie is just so rich as if it is made of complete photographs, close to images we actually see through our own eyes. Along with the plain music and the simple process of getting in and out of work and Life, I had such a great trip following the protagonist into experiencing life in the purest form, and of course in bravery. Simple idea, beautifully portrayed multi-perspective of life, interaction with people, new things and places, as well as some sense of humor, this movie is truly delightful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't live up to its potential.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was unfortunately a bit of a disappointment. It had all of the pieces in place to be one of those great movies that combine a certain innocent charm with insight and introspection to deliver a heartfelt and emotional movie that anyone can relate to. However, instead of putting that all together in a fashion that feels genuine, like The Truman Show for example, it just feels like it's missing something. Ben Stiller is great and Kristen Wiig, Shirley MacLaine, and Patton Oswalt (among others) do a great job in their supporting roles, albeit far shorter than they should've been. I think the big problem was Adam Scott's character. People like that are so seldom they almost don't even exist and this movie hinging on his "bullying" made it tough to relate to. I don't mind that the pace was slow either. I expected that. I didn't expect for the film to build to a moment of revelation only to end abruptly and without much to hang your hat on, so to speak.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great story, a movie which is good for heart and mind. It made me laugh and cry at the same time. Many people marketed this movie as "The new Forrest Gump". It has some similarities (character evolution, travel, love story, the weak boy becomes an hero...) but also many differences (talks about the current decade, less American history focused, weaker main character). However, it's still a great story, that will leave something in your heart. Also it talks about hard times in world economy, and how the new big managers are really not able to give value to the past and to the "traditional workers". It also speaks about family, in a gentle but powerful way.After watching this movie you will dream about traveling, growing and make better use of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the greatest films, this should be up there with Gump and Shawshank. Ben Stiller has done an amazing job directing (although it seems there were many a directer in the years this film was being made) and an amazing job acting. It seems to include the perfect amount of comedy, brilliantly enacted by Stiller and Wig both very prestigious comedy actors. The integration of music was done very well too, Arcade Fire's Wake Up capped off a perfect scene with the staple quote of the film and some excellent cinematography. When you leave the theatre you'll want to buy yourself a travel journal right then and there and catch the next flight to anywhere.I would recommend this film to everyone, truly soul touching stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania.Want to watch good film, with some breathtaking scenery, nice acting and nice story but nothing new or memorable? "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is for you. Don't expect anything revolutionary, no twists at the end, just a nice film, with as i said some gorgeous scenes, and some nice cameos. Actually, before watching a movie and reading summary, i imagined different film, with B.Stiller acting out in some crazy / fantasy comedy (and at the very brief moments - it is), but i got different film than i imagined, a really nice one. I don't think i will remember this film for more than two days after i saw it, but i glad i did, it was nice one while it lasted, but nothing you will remember for a long time, sometimes it gets all over the map. It's clear that a film had a good budget, you can clearly see this, but it didn't have good screenplay, and that you can clearly see it as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As we know that Ben Stiller is a fine actor mostly in comical roles. But no one ever used better than himself in his own directions. Yes, most of his great performances and movies came under his steering of the ship. This is the one more movie where he exposed his creativity in filmmaking as well as acting.'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' was anticipated to be one of an Oscar node for the 86th ceremonial season, but failed unexpectedly. That did not stop the movie to the viewers to enchant with its beautiful contents. The movie was shot in many exotic places around the world, especially the sub-arctic countries like Greenland, Iceland et cetera are so alluring. According to the story the movie won't stick to the same location for more than 15-20 minutes. The constant change of places played a vital role in the movie's successive cinematographic presentation.It was a refreshing movie compared to the movies that released in the same year. In everything, from the distinct characters to the places it takes place to the technical parts. Those places as they say were not exactly the same. Most of them were shot in a studio and the rest were the magic of special effects.Like I always say critics are a bad influence for creative movie like this. This movie was thrashed by them, but movie fanatics are the one who stood by the side so I am happy to be one and I loved this movie. This movie was based on the short story of the same name that was published in a magazine in 1939 and was second movie adaptation after the 1947 version. If you are looking for a variety in a movie well here it is.</fullReview>

As if it isn't known that breathtaking scenes of volcanoes and near-death experiences are profound. Of course they are.

		<shortDescription>Perfect bit of inspiration, humor, and drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was heartwarming, humorous, and inspiring at most. Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) plays an average, quiet, and socially awkward man who cannot seem to control his wild sense of imagination. Walter Mitty works for Life Magazine as the Negative photography department manager. When the company is hit with the transition to an online only magazine Ben Stiller's job is to develop the final cover for the magazine. When Sean O' Connell (Sean Penn) sends the photos for Mitty to develop the front cover slide goes missing and this leads the beginning of an adventure of discovering his true self while actually living his dreams. The cinematic aspects of this film were amazing. Stiller brings us to many breathtaking parts of Iceland, Canada, and New York. Walter Mitty flies in a helicopter with a drunken man, takes a boat, and skateboards all the way to Iceland where he hopes to find Sean O' Connelly (Sean Penn) and recover the missing photo. The dramatic transition from Mitty's normal life in New York to suddenly arriving to Iceland may inspire many to travel. The cinematography being exceptional in terms of capturing scenes of vast mountain ranges and out at sea gives a very familiar feel to Stiller's other (not so satisfying) film Tropic Thunder because it is filmed in beautiful areas from around the world. This film is surely uplifting and inspirational and well suitable for those who consider themselves dreamers. Although the film is filled of a few far-fetched events, such as explosive scenes and Mitty imagining himself as a super hero who encounters his dream girl Cheryl Melhoff (Kristen Wigg), this is purely Ben Stiller's comedic side shining through and gives a great twist to the film. This film is Ben Stiller at his best as he plays a part that is relatable to many and screams the message that being yourself and living your dreams is possible. I would absolutely recommend this movie to those who are willing to look past the sometimes out of bounds scenes and search for the true message within.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty(2013)Starring:Ben Stiller,Kristen Wiig,Patton Oswalt,Shirly Maclane,Adam Scott,Kathryn Hahn,Sean Penn,Terrance Bernie, and Adrian MartinezDirected By:Ben StillerMy ReviewI've seen both versions of this adventure with Danny Kaye and Ben Stiller who read the short story unlike me when he was younger in school. I saw both versions at the right time in my life,cause I daydream often about adventures and things going my way. When I saw the first trailer I was watching it like what the heck is this then I read what it was about and what it was based off of and that's when I thought to myself I must see this. I read a comment on YouTube when the exclusive footage went online that said "There is a Walter Mitty in each of us, we live in a world were we work for long hard hours and don't have time or energy to go on some kind of adventure,they call it modern society but it should be called modern slavery."In this re-imagining of Jame Thurber classic short story Ben Stiller plays daydreamer Walter Mitty who has a crush on his co-worker named Cheryl Melhoff(Kristen Wiig) and it's Life magazine's final days before it goes digital. Walter's new boss Ted(Adam Scott) is asking for the final piece of the telegram for the picture for the cover but Walter lost it. He goes on a global journey to find Sean O'Connel(Sean Penn) to see if he can help him.This film was actually a passion project of director Ben Stiller, he has been wanting to do this film for years. He does a great job of trying to pull his own performance of Walter Mitty who is another character that be considered relate-able. I saw comments on YouTube about people saying they daydream or know someone who does,I do. Kristen Wiig gives one of my favorite performances of hers cause it's out of what she use to which is comedy, like Stiller. Adam Scott was great as his mean boss Ted. Him and Stiller share one of my favorite sequences in the film. Sean Penn was cool as Sean O'Connel the photographer who sent Mitty the telegram with negative twenty-five. I am not very familiar with Kathryn Hann who plays Odessa, Walter's sister but I have seen Shirley MacLane once before I just don't remember where.The music is very important to the film it escort's its transcendent feel. While making the journey we take with Walter very real along with it's beautiful cinematography which is the best I've seen all year so far and I hope it gets nominated for that but I doubt it.This re-imagining of the short story should please fans of the story or the Danny Kaye version.. It hits the mark of film that it is Imaginative, filled with beautiful music, superb acting and cast, and makes you feel like your on a journey whether you relate to the character or not. I give The Secret Life of Walter Mitty a five out of five.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is a movie that is enjoyable from beginning to end. It is a movie that depicts the life of a shy photo archivist who compensates for his introversion through fantasies. These fantasies, however, are symbolic of his desire to reconnect to his younger self--a time of being unconventional and more adventurous.As a consequence of losing his father, Walter embraces an orthodox life: clean-shaven, employed, and financially responsible. This is how we are introduced to him, yet it is the beginning of his transition to recover certain aspects of his character that he had lost. Walter's quest to locate a missing frame of 35mm film takes us on an adventure that is comedic, poignant, and a little philosophical.While we view this film, we experience his progression toward assertiveness and his drive to create a better reality. When this occurs, his fantasies subside and we are left with an adult as courageous as the one in his daydreams.This film delights us with good acting, great cinematography, and visually-engaging transitions between scenes. Oh, and by the way, it has a great storyline.I'll give it 9 out of 10 buckets of buttered popcorn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Walter Mitty": A Triumph in Every Possible Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've had my IMDb account for over 8 years, but I've never written a review before; that is, I've never felt compelled to, until now.I gave the film a 10, but here's a little caveat about my grading: I don't 'kinda' like films. I either do, or don't?so it's a 1, or a 10. A flawed system, perhaps, but there are a lot of redeeming qualities that I can find in a film: directing, cinematography, acting, writing, story, music... in fact, it's difficult for me not to like a film in some respect. Clearly, I like "Walter Mitty" but don't let my pass/fail grading criteria fool you. This film is clever, touching, and?most surprisingly?authentic, and it accomplishes this in a multitude of ways.I'm not going to summarize the plot of the story; surely, you know it by now and are simply wondering whether it's worth a viewing or not. The short answer is: yes. But if you want to know /why/, continue reading. I will, instead, examine the movie based on what I perceive to be its artistic merits.First, the cinematography is splendid. The film possesses a very clean, sharp look. The colors are quite vibrant, and nearly leap off the screen (helped immensely by the truly awe-inspiring locations the film takes place in, from the busy streets of NYC to the solitary landscapes of Greenland and Iceland). "Walter Mitty" is pleasing to the eye, which is always a plus.Ben Stiller's directing is smart and inspired, and surprisingly high- octane when needed (the first daydream sequence comes to mind, as Stiller's vision caught me quite off guard, in a very good way). Visually speaking, I knew the film was in good hands from the opening scene?it's a simple sequence of Walter sitting in his apartment pining away on his laptop, and yet Stiller's framing is careful and deliberate, conveying Walter's sense of isolation and loneliness. Indeed, Stiller's directing throughout the film is always thoughtful, and never lazy. There are some directors who maintain the same style of filming throughout their careers, but there is a very clear and traceable evolution throughout Stiller's filmography, and "Walter Mitty" is his best yet.The screenplay overachieves to a great degree. Ostensibly a film about an awkward, stagnating introvert (in conjunction with what was revealed in trailers and television spots), the audience will surprisingly find themselves on an international adventure. My biggest fear?as a writer myself?was Walter's goal: of course, he wants the girl? but what will separate this film from others of the same genre? Or is it just another clone? Fortunately, there are indeed two conflicts (including wooing Cheryl, played by Kristen Wiig) that propel the story on its improbable course. And the two main characters themselves are thoroughly fleshed- out as the story goes along. We accompany them on this grand journey and truly witness a transformation occur in both of them, and you can't help but feel happy. In the end, the story is crafted with the utmost cleverness and care (the dialogue is especially rich if one pays attention), and with just enough over-the-top sequences, it manages to find glimmers of humor, action, and humanity in every little nook possible.I often feel bad for composers for comedy/romantic comedy films because they never really get to show off their chops or introduce complex melodies when all they're scoring is dialogue- and humor-based scenes; there's just not that much opportunity to really shine. With that being said, however, composer Theodore Shapiro does a commendable job. The music that accompanies "Walter Mitty" is often whimsical, with a slight air of hope, and touching when it needs to be. There were indeed two or three scenes where the music was rather noticeable and really bolstered the emotional punch, and that was a very pleasant and welcomed surprise.Just a few words before I end: I'm not a very big fan of comedy films. In fact, the last comedy film that I voluntarily watched was probably "The 40 Year-Old Virgin." With that being said, however, I don't consider "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" to be a comedy. Rather, it comes across as a drama/adventure film with humorous moments sprinkled throughout. To be quite frank: I didn't actually laugh at all during this film?but I enjoyed it immensely, and can say with all honesty that it is on my shortlist of favorite films for 2013.Strangely enough, I've always been a fan of Ben Stiller's work. I just find his characters and acting to be relatable and authentic. I have a few friends that scoff at his films and the fact that I like them, perhaps the way some scoff at Adam Sandler for seemingly losing his touch after "Happy Gilmore" and "Billy Madison." But there's just something about Stiller's movies that are borderline outlandish (if not outright), and yet, I find them to be extremely honest to the human condition?and his latest directorial work is no exception. All in all, "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is an excellent character study and a touching coming-of-middle-age story. It bubbles with vitality in every scene and conveys a fun carpe diem message. In fact, I enjoyed this film so much that I re-watched it immediately after my first viewing. Simply put, you will not regret watching "Walter Mitty." Instead, you will find yourself filled with a poignant sense of hope and?for lack of a better word?happy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best live action movie I've seen in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DISCLAIMER : In the unlikely event that anyone is reading this as a way to decide whether or not to see it, let me say that my bar for 'likable' movies is a bit different. I abhor violence so I avoid anything with very graphic and especially gratuitous violence. I also avoid things with unnecessary sex and profanity? so basically anything 'R' (in the US) and many things 'PG-13'. That leaves almost nothing besides, this, some animated movies, and Napoleon Dynamite in the past ten years. I suppose there are some 'faith-based' films but I avoid those too because I find them almost as noxious as that other stuff. /DISCLAIMERI realize it's a remake and had a pretty simple concept, but it's probably the most freshly told, visually stunning moves I've seen in as long as I can remember. It's use of CGI always moved the story along and was never mere eye-candy which we're so inundated with these days. The casting was nearly perfect (the hell. pilot deserves some kinda special Oscar) and the adventure aspect of the story was just a ton of fun. The only reason I gave it &lt; 10 stars is because of a few overly familiar funny-isms from Stiller and Patton Oswalt that sort if take you out of the story for a moment. THANKS to Ben Stiller and crew for making something that is wholly palatable and enjoyable on so many levels amidst a sea of tripe. If I ever run into Mr. Stiller again at a produce stand in Kauai I'll be sure to tell him that instead of just being star- struck this time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie to dream away a bit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Put that on a plaque and hang it at your next job."The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is an epic adventure with breathtaking images that are used to embellish the simplistic and moralizing story a bit. The whole movie has a Walt Disney atmosphere in which a nondescript person searches for a lost negative which is necessary for the last cover of the magazine "Life". I wouldn't really call it a comedy. Personally I'm not a big fan of Ben Stiller. The man always has an impassive and apathetic look that doesn't really fit into a comedy. In this movie, however, it is in place. One might expect that this would change slightly as the movie progresses. Yet he remains walking around with an expressionless face the entire movie, despite the fact that he travels halfway around the world in search of the eccentric and unworldly photographer Sean O'Connell.Actually it's more of a dramatic adventure with a romantic slant which focuses on Mitty's daydreams. For him these dreams are a way to escape from everyday worries. At that time he can do an assertive heroic performance in the most intrepid adventures. In those dreams he's an imaginary person he never will be. He's a loyal employee of "Life" already for years and he is working together with another "nobody" in the basement of the building, where they digitize the negatives. He also falls secretly in love with his colleague Cheryl. Of course, he is too shy to speak to Cheryl personally, so he subscribes at the dating-site "eHarmony".This is also the opening scene, and for me, actually the funniest moment in the whole movie. Unfortunately it's not continued in this way. He can't contact Cheryl through this site because his profile isn't complete. He still needs to complete the topics "Hobbies and Traveling". The way things develop during the movie ensures that he finds himself looking at life in a different way and the search for the negative leads him successively to Iceland, Greenland and the Himalayas, making his profile extremely adventurous and he succeeds in making a connection with Cheryl.Stiller played in this film with more character than all his previous movies. A role that fits so perfectly with his appearance . The most colorful character was played by Adam Scott as the unpleasant manager Ted Hendricks. A young yuppie that leads the transition from the magazine to the digital era and does this in such a derogatory pedantic way. He doesn't even know the motto of "Life". His appearance with his gaudy beard was so caricatured that it was actually laughable. The moment Mitty hands over the negative to Ted and appears with a small beard because of him traveling back and forth, it seems as if he has risen to the level of Ted. A beautiful used metaphor . Kristen Wiig plays the adorable and sometimes timid Cheryl. Shirley MacLaine plays the role of Mitty 's mother in a restrained manner. The most charismatic role was played by Sean Penn as the eccentric photographer who sits lonely and hidden on the top of a mountain to photograph a mysterious snow leopard. A perfectly casted Penn who is a personification of the morale in this film. Regardless what your contribution is, ultimately you are still an important part in the whole process.The denouement and the final picture that adorns the front page still was a bit of a surprise to me and the sweet romantic ending was a bit corny. But in the end it was still a nice, in terms of imaging and content, movie. A movie to dream away a bit.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not every movie you see holds you down and pinned to the screen. I watched the movie without any prior knowledge about the genre or watching any trailer so I was venturing into the unknown (more than 100times exaggerated for my case) just like Walter Mitty, who, to quench his thirst for the case 25, travels to limitless boundaries. The movie presents some breathtaking views and scenes of places that look dreamy. The story and the portrayal of the story, the direction was exemplary. With Ben Stiller at one of his best performances, the movie shows a perspective of life and its purpose. It presents an opportunity to understand life and value the little things, the awkward ones and surely the building blocks. A must watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Witty, Fresh, and Reinventing: Stiller Impresses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Through the beautiful cinematography and the inspirational story, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty becomes a must see.The Secret Life of Walter Mitty isn't a conventional Hollywood film, and it may be taking heat for that, and few things that it may lack, but it doesn't take away from the film. It's key to look at this film like About Time. It's not a perfect film, but it's respectable and nothing short of fantastic.Some of the humor didn't reach out far enough, but there were key comedic parts such as a brief Benjamin Button parody. While the comedy wasn't hysterical, it helped open the door and gave it a sense of direction.The Secret Life is the film Stiller really needed to do next. His directing credits include the very funny and over-the-top Tropic Thunder, as well as The Cable Guy, a dark film that just seems like so much all at once. While not being a basic film, he doesn't suffocate the film with extra material. The plot is straight-forward, and the freedom is refreshing.Visually, the film is spectacular. The shots are breath-taking, showing the audience a world that is far-less traveled. All of the countries, lands, and oceans are shown with such grace and beauty. The movement of the camera flows well, and the characters are well placed.Some of the actors don't shine, but when Stiller, Wiig, and Patton Oswalt are on screen, there's nothing to be disappointed by. It's quirky, funny, and witty.The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is not one of the greatest films ever made, but it is important. It's a coming-of-age story, which Stiller should work on more often (especially after producing Submarine). It's a feel good movie, that let's you explore freedom and make you want to revitalize life and live to the fullest.Stiller worked his magic on this film, and it's nothing short of breath-taking. It's a must-see film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable feel good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller is an actor I can't stand. He has almost no comedic talent, is not a great director (Cable Guy, Zoolander) so I was skeptical about this production to say the least. Surprisingly TSLoWM turned out quite well. Stiller plays a Negative (film) Asset manager who has to retrieve a lost negative for the final print cover of LIFE magazine. The film is an ode to (analog) photography and LIFE magazine and it's motto (applicable the Walter's character). The (35mm) photography looks gorgeous and Visual Effects are used sparingly to enhanced the great visuals. The music also works effectively to enhanced the mood of the film without drawing explicit attention. The lesson about life is somewhat typical for these kinds of movies and is therefore not entirely convincing but the film is actually very enjoyable to watch and probably Stiller's best work. Maybe not a classic but it will make you feel good, is a joy for the eyes and if nothing else it will surely make you want to travel more ;)</fullReview>

I have watched many movies, but this one has unique flavor in it with elements of courage, excitement, and adventure not served using extravagant common story lines. This movie totally ends it the way it must be. And also, I must say, maybe I loved the movie because I am also fond of day-dreaming. It's just amazing that reality really can surpass one's day dreams. And yes, this movie says, to live your dreams in reality. To make it real. To live it. Amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loved it!! I was expecting a lot from this movie after watching the trailer and the movie delivered every bit of expectation I had. It reflects the life of most of the office workers these days. we are lost in the corporate jungle so much that we fail to stop by and be amazed at the wonders that this world can provide. We don't realize what a valuable treasure we are losing until we have lost it. This movie shows some of the most beautiful places of the planet with exceptional beauty. As one of the characters says in the movie - "Real beauty does not ask for attention".The movie has been exceptionally directed by Mr. Ben Stiller. The man of the hour. True Masterpiece. I cannot for one point out any flaw in the storyline and its execution. Alongside that, A splendid performance as a protagonist with all the right emotions a human can possibly make. This movie and the protagonist makes you get your lazy a**es off that couch and go seeing places that are shown. Greenland, Iceland and also for that matter Afghanistan are shown in mesmerizing beauty, making you to actually daydream of being in those places ironically.This one is definitely more than just scenic movie and has a value hidden in it. Life is not just about living for the sake of living. Life is Joy that has to be celebrated in each and every moment of it.</fullReview>

I don't know why but I got a bit emotional watching the movie. May be because of the acting or the movie making or the story or all of them.Songs played in the movie are great. They touch the heart actually. Ben Stiller just seemed to be Walter Mitty, he did not look like like he was acting. Rather it was like he was actually Walter Mitty.This movie got in to the very short list of my favorite ones. Just watch it. NO! Get inside the movie.

		<fullReview>Can a silly-comedy actor be held hostage by his previous low rated works? Looks like a few detractors who badly reviewed "The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty" unjustly giving it a 1 think so. Probably cheesy parodies lovers with no taste who just want to sweat out their beers and eat popcorn. I am surprised some of them even admitted they missed Stiller's previous whack comedies...Don't get me wrong, when I heard Ben Stiller was going to remake such a great comedy with Danny Kay, I was scared to death and somewhat mad. "How dares he", I honestly thought. I was expecting another unfunny Christmas gag-movie with nothing to tell, Ben Stiller's style.I was wrong.Although this film has practically nothing in common with the original one, it is indeed a good story with believable acting, visually great and full of unspoken meaning. It even manages to be rather funny now and then, and yet there's a lot more to it. Watch it and you will know where and why.Here and there a bit emotionally basic, if you know what I mean, but still a remarkable movie.Ben Stiller will have a hard time in the future trying to maintain the substance he achieved in this ode to the good man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning, narratively irrational</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The character of Walter Mitty is not completely alien to Stiller, as the actor lately has been shying away from comedic roles in favor of more dramatic films. Whilst not terribly original, Stiller succeeds in making Walter charismatic and believable. The daydreams are visually stunning, and work very well in showing the deeper reaches of the character's insecurities and ambitions.However, Stiller's layered portrayal seems misplaced amidst the grotesque and cartoonish characters that make up the rest of the cast. Both Kristen Wiig as Cheryl, the object of Walter's affection, and Adam Scott as the main antagonist never are able to create depth in their two dimensional personalities. This is emphasized by the gaping irrationality of the plot. The premise of Walter as a bland and passive persona who has done nothing worthy of mention is carefully built up, only to be discarded completely when he travels to Greenland, Iceland and the lower Himalayas successively with little to no hesitation. The aptness with which he fights a shark and skateboards down a volcano is out of character, whilst the arc of his development as a person is unrealistic. The cookie-cutter end makes matters worse, as Walter ends up in a relationship with a woman whom he has shared minimal screen time with and the underdeveloped family-subplot is resolved by oddly selling the piano he has spent ? of the film desperately trying to preserve. All of this makes the film feel out of balance and unfinished.Despite all this, the biggest downfall of the film is its blatant product placement. Whilst it is completely understandable that the funding of a film is dependent on sponsors, the products' contrived inclusion in the plot is both annoying and unnecessary. The recurring mention of franchises and services in both dialog and image is really quite offensive.The film has a great message ('Act upon your ambitions'), has a charismatic protagonist and is shot on location in some of the most beautiful places on earth. Who can overlook the inconsistencies in the plot and characters, as well as insistent product placement (that at times feels as if watching a commercial) will surely be entertained.(AREA 555 on Wordpress)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little too dour for its message of hope and call to action, but eminently watchable nonetheless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In theory, there's a great deal to enjoy about The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty. It's an adventure epic about a downtrodden worker bee who discovers the meaning of life and the importance of living it, which gives two fine comedic talents - Ben Stiller and Kristen Wiig - the chance to dig deep and play some genuinely emotional drama. The special effects on full display in the film are gorgeous, perfectly bringing to life the dreamscape into which our protagonist would rather escape to become anyone other than himself. It's a shame, then, that the film never quite manages to embrace its own message of joy, courage and celebration. For all that it plays up the importance of doing rather than dreaming, this is an oddly sombre affair that would benefit from an injection of adrenaline and cheer.Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) has worked in the offices of Life for his entire career. The custodian of the magazine's photo archive, he processes and develops negatives sent in for publication - and has done so for so long that he's highly-regarded by someone he's never even met: fabled free-spirit photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn). Walter nurses a crush on his colleague Cheryl (Kristen Wiig), but has never been able to gather up the courage to do anything about it. When obnoxious corporate transition manager Ted (Adam Scott) turns up to shove the magazine literally into the digital age, Walter must leave his life of quiet mediocrity to hunt down the photograph that will grace the cover of Life's final issue before it becomes an exclusively digital publication.For the most part, The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty is a pleasant if slightly over-constructed watch. Walter's dream sequences are probably the best parts of the film, filled with such glorious examples of derring-do and bravery that it's no wonder he would rather live there than in the real world. In these moments, Stiller manoeuvres his camera and marshals his special effects expertly, capturing the thrill and sheer escapist fantasy of a man who exists more fully in his dreams. Walter leaps off buildings and into windows, and morphs into a rugged mountaineer ready to sweep Cheryl off her feet. The visuals are no less spectacular once Walter embarks on his quest to find Sean - one that takes him to the most far-flung corners of the planet, from Greenland to Iceland, through shark-infested waters and bubbling volcanoes.But, amidst the quite beautiful cinematography and sweetly-designed plot (the unveiling of Sean's final cover photograph for Life is really quite wonderful), Stiller the director appears to have forgotten to tell Stiller the actor to have a little fun with it all. He plays Walter in constantly perplexed, largely inexpressive mode, even when he has quite literally circumnavigated the globe in the course of his adventures. There's hardly ever a sense that Walter is enjoying himself, even a tiny bit.If that's Stiller's point - that people can still get caught up in the horrors of chasing deadlines and deliverables when they finally decide to pursue their dreams - it's a grim one, and one that isn't borne out by the rest of the film. We're supposed to see this as Walter's chance at a new, braver life, one in which he doesn't just fade into the background and live inside his head. But that heady sense of joy, excitement and liberation rarely comes through. As such, The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty often seems to lack heart, a crucial ingredient in a film so eager to appeal to the dreamer in all of us.Stiller's cast, at least, is great in an unmitigated way. He might march through the film with too little joie de vivre, but he does have a nice, yearning chemistry with Wiig, who is as effective in her role as a frazzled single mom worried about losing her job, as she is as Walter's unsuspecting muse. Penn is, perhaps, one of the few actors with enough gravitas to pull off Sean's elusive and determined artistry - he's the sort of man who tracks a snow leopard for ages, only to decide that he'd prefer to enjoy rather than capture the moment on film. Shirley MacLaine and Kathryn Hahn are excellent as Walter's mom and sister respectively, the former trying to get her son to enjoy himself more, the latter flighty in a way her brother will never be.As a director and actor, Stiller has cut his teeth on more comedic fare: from Zoolander to Tropic Thunder, he's demonstrated a flair for the absurd and ridiculous. It's ironic that what's missing from The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty - his evident attempt to move beyond comedy as outlandish as it is outrageous - is that burst of silly, warm-hearted levity that is clearly his stock-in-trade. As a result, the film is good and certainly watchable, but falls somewhat short of what Stiller no doubt hoped it would be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-intentioned...but severely flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well-intentioned...but severely flawed.The original Secret Life of Walter Mitty, released in 1947, was brilliant. Whimsical, bitter-sweet and hilariously funny. Danny Kaye almost single-handedly made the movie, with an incredible over- the- top comedic performance.The 2013 is nothing like the 1947 version, unfortunately. It has more of an attempt at a message and thus greater ambitions but is not that funny. Ben Stiller is certainly no Danny Kaye, even when he is trying to be funny, and here he isn't trying. Moreover, the whole "get out there and live life" message is delivered in such a clumsy and contrived way, you wish he had just tried to make a straight comedy (it worked in 1947!). The message is obvious from the start, but director Ben Stiller takes us on this long, protracted, silly journey to draw it out. From a point (that point being where WM meets the bogan helicopter pilot in Greenland) the movie is incredibly farcical, and not in a good way. About the only good part to the latter 50-70% of the movie is the scenery: National Geographic would be proud!Nice, sweet ending, though quite predictable and not a little bit trite.Performances are so-so. Ben Stiller overdoes the shy and retiring shtick and Adam Scott is incredibly stereotypical as the bad guy. Kristen Wiig's is probably the only engaging performance in the movie.See the 1947 version instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a World, in the Head of Walter Mitty that Does Not Exist, but don't tell Walter Mitty because that is His Escape.What a Movie it is, this Incredibly Infectious Film. It is a Humorous, Touching, Visually Arresting, Romantic, Beautiful Escape. You could say that it is an Atypical Film as it goes Against the Grain of Current Bottom Line Procedures. It is and most Likely was a Hard Sell. It's not the Latest Gross Out Comedy of Wallowing, Witless Pubescent Pandering. The Kind that Thinks that Creativity is Showing a New Way to Watch Someone take a Pee or Hurl Upchuck in Slow Motion. No this is a Somewhat Subtle, Warmhearted, Slice of a Life that No One Notices. He is a Plainly Dressed Man that Sports No Tie or Stubble. The Market Men, those Profit Pursuers were Right. They Know the Audience Out there and it has No Tolerance for a Masterpiece of Chicanery with Charm. The Movie was a Flop out of Gate. It Bombed in the U.S. and that was Predictable. But Ben Stiller has Made an Enduring Epic of a Production. The Film is about as Good as it Gets for this Type of Hardly Ever Made Movie that has No Target Audience, as it Presents its Comedy, Action, and Adventure Without the Aid of a Caped Crusader or a CGI Monster.Everyone Involved in this Glorious Film should be Proud. It is Life Affirming, Inspiring, and All the Good Things that We Need now and then. An Entertaining, Uplifting, Soul Searching, Artful Experience that Movies can be at Their Best. It may not be the Success Financially that Bottom Feeder, Bottom Liners want to make but in this Case it was Worth It.Nothing this Good should be Ignored and should be Seen by the Very People that won't See it. It just Could take the Edge off that Cynicism, and Make Them Feel Good. The Movie Might just Find a Place in Their Heart. That is going to Make Some Uncomfortable. Maybe that's why They Stayed Away in Droves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a brilliant idea - to modernize this famous story by Thurber. The visuals, the editing, the acting, the music, the sensitivity, .... its the best commercial film that I've seen that touches on artistry. Everything from the lettering on the road, on the building, the skateboard, the amazing sites, to the ending of all those photos. It was a joy to see Shirley MacLaine. Wow. Also, Greenland and Iceland= worth thinking about visiting. Of Monsters and Men , they are something special. Thanks for that. This is the best film I've seen that was handled as a work of art. Relief and hope and joy that there are artists who can really see and express it via this medium. Ben Stiller you are the best. More art films, please. LJ</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly amazing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie not sure what to expect because the trailers were not very detailed as to what the movie was about. From the beginning Ben Stiller does a great job at bringing in an element of light comedy that makes you laugh but is not over done or raunchy. This movie is one of those few movies that you watch and leave the theater thinking about life and what you are doing with yours. The music in the movie compliments to story so well, and the main reason I went to the movie is because I am a big fan of the band Of Monsters and Men and they happen to have a track in the movie. From start to finish I was captivated by this movie and I made it a point to go and buy the DVD as soon as it came out (which I never do) so I could watch this beautiful movie again and again. By far the best movie of 2013.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is a true gem for some, like me, both in picture and story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We were looking for a good movie to see for the whole family. The main actor, Ben Stiller, recalls good memories, so I checked out the popularity score. The score was surprisingly good, so I decided to give it a try. My expectations where not too high, as I looked forward to a pretty mainstream, funny and feel good comedy. Eventually, when the movie started, I got this strong and convincing feeling in my stomach, that this was really something very special. Do not ever mistrust your stomach feeling.This film is a modern adventure taking place in the life of a true but hardworking dreamer who secretly falls in love with a coworker. When the business goes bad, the numbers turns red and the working stock is cut down, our hero, thanks to apparently unexplainable mishaps, is facing unemployment. But suddenly the fantasies inside Walter Mitty's head enforces him to take action and real life and real adventure truly begins.For those of us, spending too much of our lives working hard under the influence of a stupid boss, the struggle out of rude and choking suppression out in the wild unsecured adventure, is delivered in a thrilling, exquisite and beautiful composition of pictures, scenes, settings,music, moods and characters.This was the time watching it, more than well spent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Blah Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1947 Walter Mitty film, starring Danny Kaye with an excellent supporting cast, was a Technicolor gem about a man who escaped from his life through fanciful daydreams. This 2013 remake borrows the bare bones of the plot but takes away most of the humor and all of the color, leaving a rather drab, serious midlife crisis movie. The pace is surprisingly slow and the tone mostly somber. There are funny parts here and there. The Benjamin Button parody is the best of all of the fantasy sequences, which isn't saying a lot. A criticism of the original movie was that its daydream sequences went on too long and there were too many of them. That's definitely not the case here. The daydreams are too brief and not interesting enough, with the exception of one or two. Also, there's a curious lack of soundtrack throughout. Perhaps it was just the slow pace that made it stand out more but there were lengthy stretches with no music that just added to the overall blah tone of the film. The movie looks like a rainy day. It's way too serious to be a good comedy and not deep enough to be a good drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of best films I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been a fan of Ben Stiller but this movie left me speechless. There isn't one thing I would change about it. Having been a world traveler my-self I can relate to the realm Stiller as a director had in mind when he made the film. This film is full of wonder, humility, inspiration, soul searching, optimism, honesty, and I would say also a sense of magic. The film's scenery took my breath away and the story line kept me on my toes the entire length of the film. For me there was a very deep and inner self experience of life and all the challenges and aspirations it carries. The movie left me emotional and speechless. You can't help but feeling happy after you watch it. It is a perfect family movie and I believe it drives a sense of innocence which at this point in time is lacking in most movies. AWESOME MOVIE!!!!! Well done Stiller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very subtle yet stunning movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The whole movie doesn't tell you anything that is very thought-provoking but the journey itself may inspire you in a way that you feel refreshed suddenly. It is the first time I watch a movie directed by Ben Stiller. Before I watched it, I thought it would be a very funny little movie that could be a great leisure after you finish your dinner. Yet it turns out to be a very subtle, stunning and gorgeous movie telling you to not live in your fantasy but act what you want to. The best part of this movie is how it is shot. It seems to me the movie is shot by a very old camera with a bit yellowish color enshrouding the scene which makes it a little more subtle you may so. Anyway, not going to talk about the details. just watch it . and you know what i mean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has a %47 percentage rating on Rotten Tomatoes. For the life of me I can't figure out why. Perhaps I'm in the minority, but I thought this movie was pretty freaking good.Who is Walter Mitty? For the entire 114 minute length, I saw me. The average Joe among average Joes. Living in a world a bit too slow and small compared to the flashy universe that is his mind. The mind, where one minute I'm a surfboarding heartthrob ripping tidal wives the size of skyscrapers, caused by a storm of asteroids. Then the next, I'm a awesome super hero, stopping a Michael Mann style bank heist. It's an awesome idea to see an everyday, day dreamer go out and live a fantasy and take on an adventure. Some of the "zone outs" shown in the film are hit and miss, but I think the biggest plus I can give this movie, other than how much I saw myself in the title character's position, is the look of the movie. The set design's in the Life offices, to the gorgeous landscapes of Greenland and Iceland. Ben Stiller, knows how to make a good looking movie, we have further proof with Tropic Thunder. The scene parodying Benjamin Button, was comedy gold. Unfortunately, I don't think a lot of people got it at first. The movie isn't overly comical like some of Stiller's other films, but it really is a nice change of pace for Mr. Stiller, even Kristen Wiig was better than normal with her performance. Some of the more dramatic elements didn't work with me as much as I think the script wanted, the random moment with an ex-boyfriend in the film seemed pretty pointless and the scenes with Walter's family are ironically the least effective when it comes to creating any sense of connection with the characters. Adam's Scott's character was also a pretty big negative. He was such a unnecessarily rude, and dreadful character. I understand he's the closest thing to a "villain" the movie has, but every scene he was on, I just wanted to light his horrible looking beard on fire.I still had a blast with this movie, it was almost a relaxing kind of roller coaster. Ben Stiller is, surprisingly, an actor/director whose future projects I will eagerly awaiting, he hasn't disappointed me yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have nothing negative to say about this film. I am actually glad Iceland is becoming so popular in Hollywood these days, because it has long been a stronghold of natural wonder and cultural glory, just typically less likely to be seen on screen before than it is today. I don't even want to classify this film as a simple "romantic comedy" because the comedy is not the driving force of this film (although the daydream vignettes do have quite a comical effect when put in the context of Mitty's reality), and because the romance seems to tie in quite strongly with Mitty's quest for self hood and adventure, which makes the film's love story deeper and ultimately more fulfilling than other mainstream romantic movies I've seen. So, soundtrack? Fits perfectly with the images of the film; it is good that understated Swedish folk artist Jose Gonzalez continues to churn out those subtle classics that make an overcast day and a hot cup of tea seem close to perfect. Cinematographically, I have to say, the images were positively breathtaking at times; specifically, I am talking about the way way long shots where Mitty is traversing bridges by bike or foot, or when he is trying to reach a volcano and has the Icelandic geography as his backdrop; or the close-ups on Mitty when he realizes the volcano is about to erupt and he cannot understand that the driver of the car is trying to tell him to get in so he can drive them both to safety; I think that might have been a fish-eye lens there, but I am not entirely sure, as the image was only just barely warped. The special effects are really above par, too: such as in the fight sequence between the protagonist and his boss. I know that for many, this sort of thing doesn't count in the evaluation of a film, but I am also a sucker for a decent title sequence and end credits, and the graphic presentation of the titles at first, then the cast and crew at the film's close, are really the kind of thing that makes me go, "Damn, I've GOT to learn how to DO that!" I think most of all I loved the journey the film took us on, from a place of Mitty's longing for a seemingly out-of-reach coworker on an internet dating site, to a place of dreaming, to a place of self-discovery and making those dreams a reality, to getting the girl in the end. But something about this film probably will not bother you the way stereotypical boy-wants-girl narrative film does, because it really didn't for me.If you are looking for familiar actors in a wholly new setting and under wholly different acting conditions, beautiful image capture, engaging visuals including special effects, some kind of representation of Icelandic culture, some moving statements about art, photography, and journalism (or really any field that blends art and the corporate world), and a better than average soundtrack, then this film is most definitely worth your time.My hat (and I can say this since I wore one today) goes off to Ben Stiller, his cast and crew. I have a renewed interest in narrative romances, so long as they measure up to this one. It actually made me cry as the credits rolled, I was so full of love for TSLOWM.Kudos!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main charm about this film is how the audiences can actually connect and relate with the protagonist of this story. About a average guy that has a vivid imagination and the habit of zoning out, going on a journey to see and go on a adventure. Although random it's enthralling to see Mitty's imagination come to life in his mind. This is a well made movie that is immersive and imaginative. I liked the message of how "not to just be a dreamer, but try to seek out and achieve that dream". It even has a great soundtrack to go with it.

		<shortDescription>A movie that hits you on a very personal level &amp; makes you look at your life and how you live it. I really loved it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Let's make every moment count starting now." Walter Mitty (Stiller) is a boring unadventurous man who daydreams all day and works for LIFE magazine. When he finds out the magazine is publishing it's final issue all he has to do is find the negative for the final cover. This turns out to be a life changing experience and Walter Mitty finally discovers who he is. I have to admit that I was not excited about watching this going in. The trailer seemed boring to me and I am not a big Ben Stiller fan. I am not too proud to admit when I'm wrong and I was way off the mark on this one. From the opening scene you get to know and feel for Walter and during the course of the movie you root for him and share his experiences with him as if they were your own. Walter Mitty is the type of guy we all relate to and that's what makes this such a good movie. By the end he becomes someone we all wish we could be. This is not just a good movie its a very inspiring movie that needs to be seen by anyone unsure of themselves, and really who isn't? I highly recommend this movie and this is Ben Stiller's best work yet. Overall, a movie that hits you on a very personal level and makes you look at you life and how you live it. I give this an A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wake up from your daydreaming and go see the Secret life of Walter Mitty. It's pretty alright film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I glad it was finally made after going through development hell, but it doesn't really follow the 1939, short story by James Thurber. It's so loosely based on. The 1947 movie of the same name was different from the book to the point that the author hatred the film for its crude humor, but as less it was follow the book more closely. This 2013 adaption directed by Ben Stiller is very different from the original. In this film, Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) is a negative assets manager of photographs at Life magazine who frequently daydreams of fantastic adventures, and has a crush on his coworker Cheryl (Kristen Wiig). When he lost a very important photograph from Photojournalist Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn). He is forced to stop daydreaming, and live life by finding Sean O'Connell across the world and recover the MacGuffin type missing specific negative Frame 25 call '"Quintessence" of Life" before Life Magazine final print issue converts to online status. In the short story, it deals with a vague and mild-mannered man who drives into Waterbury, Connecticut, with his wife for their regular weekly shopping and his wife's visit to the beauty parlor. During this time he has five heroic daydream episodes. These heroic episodes should had been in this film, or at less, mention, because the movie is really slow to start off. It takes a very long time, before Mitty is call to adventure here. Surprising, the movie doesn't have that many daydreaming sequences which kinda bug me. It lacks the satirical over the top tone of the original story. I would had love to see him as a magnificent surgeon performing a one-of-a-kind surgery, then as a deadly assassin testifying in a courtroom, and then as a Royal Air Force pilot volunteering for a daring, secret suicide mission to bomb an ammunition dump. I guess, jumping into an ocean with sharks and escaping a volcano is daring, but it's less Mitty when you think about it, because he does those things for real, not imagining it. The best thing about Walter Mitty was the daydreaming and how it was fantasies by details of Mitty's mundane surroundings. It was cool to see what triggers them. The movie could use the symbolism better, like the Stretch Armstrong scene. It's weird to see, Walter Mitty had an over the top fight with obnoxious corporate transition manager Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott) over it, then easily give it away to some kids for a skateboard, seeing that his family got it for him. The Stretch Armstrong toy could represent a lot about his child life nature, and him slowly getting over it, to grow up. Surprising the daydreaming scene weren't that funny, it felt really dumb, than smart. One joke kill it, Benjamin Button. The only time, it was semi-funny was when reality hit in. I love the whole isolated frontier humor. I do love the film for its great use of music. David Bowie's "Ground Control to Major Tom" was the highlight of this. I do like the Life magazine symbolism as he works for a magazine, when he doesn't have little to no life of his own. Still, the film put Life magazine in a negative light with how they supposedly treat their workers, badly. I surprised, Life magazine allow them to use their brand. I do have mixed feelings about the use of pop culture references such as Papa Johns and E-Harmony. The movie has way too much product placement. There isn't much of a secret life of Walter Mitty as everybody can tell that he is daydreaming all the time. Also missing in the film is Thurber's love of wordplay can be seen in his coining of several nonsense terms in the story. What I love about the film is that Walter Mitty doesn't intentionally attempts to mislead or convince others that he is something that he is not. He's pretty honest about who he is, and what he does. Still, it bit unrealistic to think that Ben Stiller's Walter Mitty was once a skater. In this film, Walter stops being Walter Mitty and more like Edmund Hillary halfway through the film. It seem really unrealistic for him to become that good in hiking in two weeks. Honestly, it felt like a movie about mountain climbing. It was pretty beautiful shots of Iceland throughout the film. Then there was a pretty good scene with Mitty trying to photograph a rare snow leopard that represent the whole film very well without being too preachy. In my opinion, they could had stop there, and I would be happy with the ending. The true ending was a bit lacking. It felt like his unrealistic romanticism of his fantasies were coming true. That isn't what the film should be telling as it became too predictive. It should be telling, how to understand disappointments in life, and move on and keep dreaming. Overall: This movie lacks a lot of things that the original done well, but it shows the 'Be in the moment' lifestyle in a good light that it's worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of Ben Stiller's directorial work and comedic work and he's a pretty talented guy. Zoolander, a film which he starred in and directed is bold and hilarious and a very fun time. But The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is different. It's much more serious and dramatic than a lot of his other roles. It gives Ben Stiller a chance to expand as a filmmaker and show how well of a visual director he is and if he can handle directing serious material. I understand critics are split on The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Audiences, for the most part, love it but on Rotten Tomatoes, critics have given this film a 50% which means 50% of critics enjoyed the film. It's kind of a love-it or hate-it film. I'm on the side that really enjoyed it. It's messages are simple, clear and relevant. America is known for being a generally lazy country and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is trying to inspire people to go and live their dream and do something great with their lives. It has a lot to say about following your dreams and says it clearly and in an entertaining fashion.Ben Stiller's performance as Walter Mitty is stellar and engaging. Walter Mitty is a mild-mannered, shy guy and Stiller hits the nail on the head. It's interesting to see Kristin Wiig take on some serious material. She still has a couple of funny lines but for the most part, her character is a dramatic one. She handles it very well and is likable. One of the film's flaws are the characters. There are a lot of generic characters that are hardly given any development including Adam Scott and Sean Penn's character. That didn't get in the way of my enjoyment of the film, though. The film almost entirely centers around Walter Mitty and his character is given a lot of attention to detail.Ben Stiller proves himself as a dramatic director in this specifically and a visual director. The film is breathtaking in terms of visuals. The cinematography is something different than what you usually see in mainstream films. It sort of resembles Wes Anderson's without being a total rip-off. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a very fun time and a very good movie. It's worth your money.I give The Secret Life of Walter Mitty a B+.Read all of my reviews at www.thecheapseatsfilmreviews.weebly.com!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning, emotionally lacking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Setting out to prove to the world that he is more than mere male models and zipper accidents actor/director Ben Stiller has chosen James Thurber's famous short story as inspiration for this wannabe life changing movie that whilst featuring many an incredible image and playing out with an inoffensive charm, is a tale that wants us to believe that it is more than it is and upon reflection is about as meaty as a vegetarians banquet.The downfall of Stiller's film is that the actual real life tale of dreamer Walter who must enter reality and finally do something with his life is not as grand or wonderful as it thinks it is, scenes played out in Walter's imagination are enjoyable yet slightly too silly (a scene with a Stretch Armstrong doll in particular) and the journey that Walter takes to discover the lost negative is rushed and almost as unbelievable as his dreams, giving off the sense of too much fantasy when we should be partaking in a reality based journey. The sense of playfulness is a major factor in the romance of Walter Mitty feeling unbelievable also.Stiller and Wiig's chemistry while not bad is not fully utilised in the film, with perhaps a mere 10 minutes or so screen time dedicated to establishing and growing a bond between Walter and Cheryl. Stiller spends to much time coming up with spectacle when an ace up his sleeve may have been more time spent in the real world letting the audience see and feel the love blossoming between the two lost souls. With a story that does not live up to it's full potential the film does however showcase a talent Stiller has never shown before with a keen eye for detail, a well edited pace and perfectly chosen musical score all adding up to display that Stiller is more than a mere comedy director.Walter Mitty is an enjoyable tale sure to please many both young and old, even though one feels that deep down there is a more profound and fully formed version that could of sprung to life. As a tale about finally doing not merely dreaming it's a perfectly adequate movie with many a stunning image, an easy going atmosphere and the movie is hopefully a stepping stone for Stiller to tackle even more challenging material in the future and create a classic for the ages that he wanted to do with this movie.3 and a half Stretch Armstrong's out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>uplifting in parts, but felt the plot was a bit weak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the hype surrounding this I was looking forward to seeing Ben Stiller's ambitious directorial and acting opus. I found it quite inspiring (yes, I agree with some reviewers it did feel like an ad) in parts, yet I felt there was something missing about the film. His quest to search out the legendary photographer he had been working with (but never met) becoming a sort of 'finding himself' through being adventurous.etc, I don't know if it quite worked as well as it should have. I mean was it really realistic that his main motivation would be to travel all that way for a simple photograph? I just felt it could've been done better. The cinematography and acting was pretty good, I think Stiller isn't bad at dramatic roles, although I agree with some reviewers he tends to play the same character in many of his films, whether they be comedy or drama, e.g. in Meet the Parents, Along Came Polly. I kind of miss him doing his more outlandish roles like Zoolander, Dodgeball or even his bit- part in Happy Gilmore. I wasn't a big fan of Tropic Thunder btw. But yeah, I can understand the mixed reviews. Still, I found it a reasonably enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Preachy but still enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"To see the world, things dangerous to come to. To see behind walls, draw closer. To find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life."That quote is the central theme of this film directed by Ben Stiller and adapted by Steve Conrad (The Pursuit of Happiness) from James Thurber's short story, which actually is repeated throughout the film and can even be read during various scenes. It is a feel good message about achieving your goals and finding your purpose in life, but at the same time it's repeated so many times that the film feels forced and preachy at times making it loose its value. This is without a doubt Stiller's most ambitious film, but unfortunately it becomes predictable and instead of focusing on the adventures it becomes a preachy film about the clichéd phrase "Stop dreaming, Start living." My main complaint however has to do with the pacing of the film which is really unbalanced during the first 30 minutes where the story seemed to lack identity and compelling characters. It really suffers from some sort of identity crisis at first not really understanding what kind of film it wants to be. The romantic relationship didn't work very well either, and Kristen Wiig was underused. Her character didn't have much depth and she seemed too restrained in her role. On a positive note, the strongest point of the film was without a doubt the cinematography which was beautiful and once the story becomes a globe trotting adventure going through Greenland, Iceland, and Mount Everest it really picks up and becomes escapist entertainment. By the end it's difficult not to leave with a warm and optimist heart because the story ends up being quite inspirational. The film may not be the modern fairytale it tries so hard to be, but it does have some fun and entertaining moments. Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) has worked for Life magazine over twenty years as one of the main photo developers, but now that the company has decided to go digital many of the employees feel their jobs are hanging on the line. Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott) has been assigned to manage the company's transition and isn't too impressed with Walter once they meet and he begins to day dream and zoom out during the middle of a conversation. Walter does this a lot since he is bored with his life and dreams about doing things he would never do in real life, like speaking to his co-worker Cheryl (Kristen Wiig) whom he has a crush on. Walter's life takes an interesting turn when he doesn't find one of the films that his elusive photographer (played by Sean Penn) has sent him which is supposed to be the cover of the magazine's last issue. This leads Walter to travel across the globe trying to locate him in order to save his job, and that is when his true adventure really begins. No more dreaming, it's time to live.Ben Stiller gives an entertaining performance, but as I mentioned before the romantic relationship between his character and Wiig's didn't really work too well. I hated Adam Scott in this film and thought that his character was too cartoonish and over the top. His scenes weren't funny, they felt awkward and forced like many other moments of the film. Shirley MacLaine and Patton Oswalt on the other hand gave great performances and stood out in their supporting roles. Patton was probably the highlight of the film for me despite not having much screen time. It was also interesting to see Sean Penn deliver a comedic role in a Ben Stiller film considering the hilarious scene in Stiller's previous film, Tropic Thunder, involving the never go full retard scene referencing his role in I Am Sam. There were several funny moments despite some of the misses and the beautiful scenery makes this film worth checking out. The day dreaming sequences didn't work very well for me, although I laughed really hard at the Benjamin Button one. Despite being uneven it is an entertaining and optimistic film. Be warned there is a lot of product placement in this movie, but I didn't have a problem with all the commercializing since I think it is part of life anyways. I guess in the end the long development and producing issues the film went through hurt its potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Uplifting Story About Life and Reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone has a dream to be something they are not. For Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller), that's to be noteworthy. A chronic daydreamer, Mitty lives a simple life in a New York apartment and goes to his job at Life Magazine where he is in charge of negative photos ? a job that he's had for 16 years. Having done basically nothing with his life other than master skateboard tricks as a teenager, Mitty constantly daydreams about being somebody different ? an adventurer, a hero, and a romantic.Mitty's life heats up when he meets Cheryl Melhoff (Kristen Wiig), a recently divorced single mom with an eHarmony profile and a new job at Life. When Life is bought by a big corporate company and decides to move strictly online, jobs, including Mitty and Melhoff's are put in jeopardy. When Mitty can't find a negative from renown photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) that was scheduled to be the cover for the last print issue of Life, he sets out on an amazing global journey beyond his wildest imagination.Loosely based on a 1947 movie of the same name, Walter Mitty is your typical, run-of-the-mill feel-good movie. The underlying tone of the movie is obvious ? take advantage of everything life has to offer. Going in with an open mind, Walter Mitty is a movie that can definitely give someone a new perspective on life in general.There honestly isn't much to complain about in Walter Mitty. It's a simple story of one man who lives in his head and has to break his way out. Ben Stiller pretty much plays the same role he does in most of his other movies. Kritsen Wiig is a fine supporting actress, and Sean Penn's surprisingly limited and very few worded role is great. While not anywhere near the best picture of the year, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a good movie about the everyman, and one that is worth a shot.Rating: 6 of 10 BrickMovieReviews.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where Have All The Good Dreams Gone?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The secret of Walter Mitty's life is that he daydreams a lot? From walking out of snowy photographs as an intrepid mountain climber, to beating up his new "boss" in an elevator, to comic-book-battling the same bearded weenie in the streets of New York, Walter always lets his imagination get the best of him: You can say it defines his entire character. With more cerebral experiences than actual ones, he even has trouble filling out a dating website resume.Based on a short story and rebooted from a classic Danny Kaye film, THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY stars actor/director Ben Stiller in the title role: a passive man whose daydreams keep him distracted until something real happens.Working for the soon defunct LIFE magazine, a negative to what's to be the last cover is lost? So right as we're getting to know the man through his creative reveries, Walter cuts loose on a real adventure.To find the missing photo he treks in search of Sean Penn's Sean O'Connell, an intrepid globe-trotting LIFE photographer, and winds up in both Greenland and Iceland: battling sharks, riding a skateboard down a gorgeous mountain road, and much too easily connecting (via cell phone) to his dream girl. Not only is the original theme a thing of the past, but it's difficult to tell what's real, what's in his mind or, at this point, if that device even matters.It's fine to make a big budget art-house film about discovering one self through an existential journey, but why did those daydreams happen at all? During the second half of MITTY, his wild imagination became something looked back on in melancholy shame, and yet Walter's secret life was the best thing he had going: maybe not for him, but for the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Escapism Beyond Limits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty heightens James Thurber's short story into a large scaled inspirational film about making big dreams come true. It's a nice way to suit for the idea. There is a makings for a totally endearing picture. Director Ben Stiller obviously pours a lot of ambition to the film which brings an absolute visual stunner. It may have pushed the fantasy stuff too hard, even at the scenes that aren't even imaginary anymore, but then it still manages to provide plenty of charms in every moment.The adventurous parts feel nothing more than a simple dazzler, it's a much compelling movie when it focuses on Mitty's everyday life by getting to know about him. Keeping him in his dull ordinary reality reveals his special daydreaming. It's quite decent when it comes to the characterization of his fancy condition, relationship with the good people around him, and lack of assertiveness to the mean strangers; which results a pleasant and admirable enough portrait to show the simplicity of the character's loop cycle. When it separates him from the ordinary world, it becomes a different movie. This is where it is free to express its dazzling panache, showing off its cinematic creativity. While they all look good, they seem nothing more than whimsical images to impress the viewers how spectacular these exteriors look. It doesn't exactly help the plot that much, other than putting Mitty away from his comfort zone and searching for Sean O'Connell.The largeness of the journey also kind of brought a little inconsistency, like ever since Walter begins traveling, it just strays the extraordinary anywhere and cares less about the difference between the impossible of his imagination and their reality. It would have make more sense if the daring situations didn't happen too quick, but again we shouldn't fault for someone who wants to make things creative. This certain (and silly) flaw won't be a big deal if you don't think too much about it. Besides, it's actually not a bad thing. The cinematography and the special effects brim wonder and that's all what you need to know.It's difficult to dislike The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, the same way it's difficult to dislike Ben Stiller in movies, even when it unbalances the unbelievable and incredibly fills with creepy amount of product placements. But who wouldn't enjoy a light entertainment that tends to inspire and has a very likable lead character? Because when blockbusters go dark, you sometimes need a pleasant escapism that serves undeniable lovely warmth. It's not yet the perfect vision you expected, but all the hipsteristic filmmaking and genuine heart still makes it worth the experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll keep this pretty brief, without any spoilers. This movie was not what I was expecting ! I don't know anything about the original story or short film or what ever came before. I'm simply rating this one as I see it. It was an average movie, not terrible, but sort of slow and without any real depth to it, if that makes sense. There is definitely some great scenery &amp; some good ideals displayed, but otherwise it's your typical Hollywood fairy tale type with a predictable everybody lives happily ever after ending. Look it's not unwatchable I guess but a 5 out of 10 for mine, it just passes &amp; that's only because of the fantastic locations seen in it I think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Spoiler)If you're gonna do a remake, then keep it close to the original or make it better. I expected it to be just as funny as the original with a similar storyline. This was just a sad guy who daydreams... What was sad is losing my time watching this movie and hoping the next scene would deliver, but it never did. There was no point to the story and I didn't feel his strong motivation to find the missing photo. I couldn't care about any of the characters or their motives. Everyone was being fired, why would they care about pleasing beard guy who obviously didn't care about any of them.This would have been a fine film if it didn't use the same title.</fullReview>

You do not need to have plenty of money to do what you want. 3. Let you imagination run wild. It might happen. 4. Live you dreams. 5. Love your work. It will eventually love you in return. 6. Take risks. 7. Learn to trust people. 8. Read between the lines always. 9. Find answers. 10.It is never too late. The musical scoring is perfect and it will make you feel the movie more. The ending is superb. If you are confused in life, watch the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should become a beloved classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY': Five Stars (Out of Five) Ben Stiller directs, produces and stars in this second film adaptation of James Thurber's classic short story (following the 1947 version starring Danny Kaye). The screenplay was written by Steve Conrad (who also wrote such critically acclaimed drama films as 'THE PURSUIT OF Happiness', 'THE WEATHER MAN' and 'WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY'). It's about a day-dreamer who's always dreaming of adventure and romance (often involving his new co-worker) who finally goes on a real life adventure to find a missing photograph. The film also stars Kristen Wiig, Adam Scott, Kathryn Hahn, Shirley MacLaine and Sean Penn. I found it to be visually beautiful and emotionally breathtaking; the perfect adventure-drama film for the kid in all of us! Stiller plays Walter Mitty, a day-dreamer in his 40s who is constantly dreaming of a better and more exciting life than the one he seems like he's trapped in. He works at Life Magazine and has recently became romantically interested in his new co-worker Cheryl Melhoff (Wiig). Both their jobs are threatened though as Life Magazine is transitioning into an online magazine and will be laying off a bunch of employees soon. Mitty has worked there a long time (16 years) but his job is especially in jeopardy when he can't find a special photo that Life's photojournalist Sean O'Connell (Penn) has entrusted him with; the picture is supposed to be the cover of the last magazine. Mitty must follow clues, from other negatives, and travel around the world in order to find the missing photo (by tracking down O'Connell).I was really looking forward to this film, from seeing the amazing trailers, and I wasn't disappointed (in the slightest). Stiller has never been more likable and his direction has never been more beautiful. I like his other films ('THE CABLE GUY', 'TROPIC THUNDER', 'REALITY BITES') but this is his masterpiece. The music is moving and perfectly placed and the visuals are stunning. Most of all it's a very relatable and inspiring film (for me at least), these are my favorite movies. The fantastical dream scenes get a little too cartoonish and comedic but at least that element of the film is contained just in the day-dream sequences (which makes sense). The rest of the movie is emotionally dramatic and extremely touching and moving. I don't see anything to really complain about in it; it's a truly beautiful film and should become a beloved classic!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Q1b3lZ2TY</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expected Better! 3/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: I didn't really like this film. I found it pretty boring and it seem to drag in places. There were a couple of scenes which were brilliant, when Witty let his mind wander, but apart from that, I struggled to stay awake. I had high expectations of the film because of the posters and the fact that Ben Stiller was directing it, but in was very disappointed. Watching Stiller going around the world to find a negative to go on the last issue of LIFE just didn't work for me and I did find the serious side of Stiller quite uninteresting. I loved Tropic Thunder, which was also directed by Stiller, but this film really needed some wit. The whole look of the film was pretty impressive, which it should be with such a big budget, but for a 2 hour movie, it just didn't work for me. Disappointing!Round-Up: I think that Stiller was trying to show another side to his acting ability which I didn't really enjoy watching. Everybody knows his phrases and silly jokes now, so I can understand why he was trying to do something serious, with a touch of comedy. The movie would have been much better if his mind wandered much more, but he chose to stick with a road movie which was extremely epic in some scenes. Anyway, the film looked good but I wasn't that impressed.Budget: $90million Worldwide Gross: $188millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there road movies about a man going around the world to find a negative to publish in the last issue of LIFE. 3/10</fullReview>

Of course its set in a perfect world with no wind, sunny skies, clean streets and where all men have girlfriends 10 years younger and out of their league. Oh lets throw in some beards cause they are in right now and some products that people are programmed to want. yes like most modern "block buster' moves these days they are saturated with corporate endorsements and follow a standard unsurprising formula which is guaranteed to entertain the average dim witted consumer. Apart from this the story is dull, and predictable , im sick of this type of film getting such high praise as its just a lazy formatted system of images and colours with the right faces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless Journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard this movie was coming out and seeing a trailer of it I thought it looked like a really fun movie. I heard it was based on a short story by James Thurber, so I sought it out and listened to an audio version narrated by Ben Stiller. The story was really short, only ten minutes, about a guy with a dull life who escapes in daydreams that are so dramatic they are silly. I thought, is a ten minute story really enough to fill an entire movie. That is the main problem with the movie. They took a ten minute story and stretched it to... twenty minutes, and then they had to fill the rest of the time with something.The movie does well enough with the daydream sequences and capturing the boredom of life in an office. The daydreams are too heavy on special effects though, but they are entertaining. I would rather they had saved their money on the effects and prolonged those kinds of escapes, since that is all that works in the movie.The biggest problem with the movie is the convoluted and pointless reasoning for Mitty's journey. What is it that causes Mitty to live life and explore the world? He is looking for a photograph. That's it. A photograph was mailed to him and one of the slides was missing and his job is to process the photograph. But why is one photograph so important we ask? In a contrived manner the film explains the photo is incredibly important because it is meant to be the final cover of Life magazine which is ending it's publishing and restarting online only. It seems unlikely that after twenty years on the job of never losing a photo Mitty would loose one now, which is called by the arrogant photographer: "The quintessence of Life." If I was Walter I would simply say to the boss that it wasn't my fault, but the photographers' fault for being careless and I would be in the right, upon which the boss, who is a jerk would reply: "You can say that on your next job interview," upon which I would rejoinder "up yours I will do that." But why not just contact the photographer with a letter or phone call, tell him he screwed up and lost the photo. In the most tiresome manner the movie explains this jerk has no phone, no mailing address, no way to contact him, and he is out in the middle of nowhere. Well f--- him you might say. But Walter Mitty, maybe wishing to impress the love interest, decides to go on a world spanning journey to find one photograph.Maybe a better way for the story to go would be to have Walter laid off by Life, and then he snaps, and decides to get a job that involves world travel, and finally living a more exciting life.Walter's search for the photographer takes him to Greenland, where he meets a very drunken and unruly man, who informs Walter that he is a helicopter pilot and he is the only one who can take Walter where he can Possibly find who he is looking for. Walter thinks for a minute that this is not a good idea to ride a helicopter into a storm with a seriously drunken man. Then, in one of his fits of daydream he is inspired to say "screw it I'm going to live life." He gets in the copter and then ends up plunging in the water and nearly gets eaten by sharks. He seems to think this experience is positive because he is finally living life, even though he nearly had his limbs torn off. Similarly later he travels to a place with an erupting volcano, because what traveler hasn't, and that adds to his excitement. It's like the real life scenes are like daydreams and not believable. Is reckless behavior that nearly leads to disaster a sign of personal growth that is inspiring and something to be used to impress the love interest.As he goes on his journey he passes through very beautiful scenery, and you have to think it is so strange that this one photograph could be worth more than the millions of dollars that went into filming all this. Why couldn't he have brought a camera with him? Maybe he isn't a professional but how hard could it be to look at a vista of mountains and say to yourself "that is the quintessence of life," *Click* then turn in the photo to the boss who would be impressed. That would be a better ending than what we have. When we see what the elusive photograph is, it is a let down, because clearly the writer had no ideas and wrote himself in a corner.Another thing that bothered me about this movie is it's use of product placement. At first it started out cute when he talked to a guy on the phone from Eharmony. Then this character kept recurring, until you see that Eharmony is an entire character. Likewise they include Papa John's in a strange and distracting way. The restaurant had a deep meaning for the character because he worked there when his own father, or "Papa" died, which is sad, and makes me want to eat there. Then when he is in Greenland, a country which is describes as having 100 people, he finds a Papa Johns restaurant in the middle of nowhere, and eats there, because the whole world loves Papa Johns. I was paid to say that.I wanted to see a positive and inspiring movie. Maybe I would be more inspired if it was good. 2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unexpected delight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Mitty, photograph curator for Time-Life, fancies new employee Cheryl Melhoff from afar: imagining himself in heroic persona, he does nothing about it. Then Life magazine closes and Mitty appears to have lost the key photograph for the cover courtesy of legendary photographer Sean O'Connell. Mitty has no choice but to track O'Connell down.Let me say that I haven't read Thurber's short story and I haven't seen the Danny Kaye movie. I suspect this version takes little from either other than the idea of a mild everyman with a vivid fantasy life. But that's OK, because this film, directed by and starring Ben Stiller, is very much its own thing, and successfully so, too.Although it has humour, it is not a comedy. Although it has fantasy, it is rooted in real people and relationships. Mitty suits Stiller's established screen persona (or a variation on it), and Kristen Wiig is a genuine pleasure as the object of his affections. Stiller's direction is also very good, with action and effects set pieces well handled, and titles and transitions proving a strong element from a production design point of view.If I had a criticism, it is that the film is a little overlong: I felt that the pursuit of O'Connell could have been trimmed somewhat.But, while I thought I would enjoy this film, it delighted me much more than I expected it to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every Secret Yearns To Be Told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Mitty isn't a deep or complex character. He is defined by his actions ? where he goes, who he speaks to, how he speaks to them, what decisions he makes. What he is, is the majority of the population. Most of us have plans to do many things. We want to scale Everest. We want to swim with grey whales. We want to bunjee jump or fly to the moon. Walter Mitty represents our laziness, and ultimately our failure.But he isn't a loser. Ben Stiller is known for taking on roles and degrading them to the lowest possible social status. His characters usually have no place in the real world because they're unable to live in it and function on the same level as normal people. Consider White Goodman, with his puffed up blonde hair and thick moustache. He is a caricature. His speech, motives and actions require him to make a fool of himself, and then he ends the movie in a position worse off than when he began it.Walter Mitty, by comparison, begins the movie in a position that's already pretty stable. He's the chief negative assets manager of Life magazine, which means he's in charge of processing, maintaining and preserving film negatives. You can bet that by the time the movie ends, he will be better off. Of course, he has a crush on a fellow worker, Cheryl (Kristen Wiig), and the movie begins with him trying unsuccessfully to leave her a wink on her eHarmony page. This whole eHarmony thing is important, because Walter's profile page is blank; he's done nothing worth mentioning in his life. He compensates by projecting his desires onto a mental canvas where he sees himself leaping through the air and into flaming buildings, rescuing Cheryl's three-legged dog and inventing a mechanical prosthetic leg in the process. "Zoning out", as his sister calls it. I'm pretty sure everyone calls it that.So Life magazine is moving to new management. It's going 100% online, like Progressive Car Insurance, which means most of the staff will be let go. To commemorate the final print edition, famed photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) has sent Walter a gift: A reel of film containing frame 25 ? the most perfect photograph he's taken, one which will send Life magazine off in style ? along with a note and a wallet. But there's a problem. Frame 25 is missing. And the new boss, the bearded prig Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott), wants it immediately or Walter's job is no more.Frame 25 essentially becomes the MacGuffin that allows Walter to embark on a journey through Scandinavia and the mountainous regions of Afghanistan as he seeks not only to find Sean O'Connell and determine the whereabouts of frame 25, but to discover himself. Here is a man who has not travelled outside of America. Now, because of one frame, he is led to Greenland, where he will leap out of an unstable helicopter into icy-cold shark-infested waters. To Iceland, a land of great beauty ? its winding roads resemble streams that weave themselves around grand mountains and lush greenery. And then to the Himalayas. Yes, at times The Secret Life plays like a travelogue of these places, but you know what? I don't care. Greenland, Iceland, and Afghanistan are spectacular.The movie is directed by Stiller, and it's his most mature and fully realised project to date. It is grounded in Walter Mitty, who is aware of his surroundings and what's going on outside of his mental projections, but able to focus on the task at hand as if he's MacGyver crossed with Carmen Sandiego. He's also funny, which is good. There are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments in this movie, and they lend an interesting balance to a story that could easily have gone astray and fallen into cheesy clichés.There are nice little touches. Shirley MacLaine and Patton Oswalt make quick but effective appearances as Walter's mother and an uber friendly eHarmony customer service agent respectively. And Penn's performance as Sean is handled with love; his appearance borders on a cameo. But ultimately, the star is Stiller who, at 48, is as alive and energetic as a 10-year old discovering a theme park for the first time. His lust for adventure is infectious, and the journey he embarks upon is altogether touching, gorgeous, and completely satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to make an Impression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a little apprehensive going to see Walter Mitty. I'd read reviews and didn't expect anything too exciting.Whilst it may not be the most exciting film, it really did make an impression. Underneath and all skits and jokes, the recurring theme of getting out there and living is constant. First of all, as most people have said, the visuals of this film are breathtaking and the people behind the cameras deserve a lot of credit. The soundtrack is also a big plus, really fitting each scene as it carries on.I've never been a great fan of comedy actors trying to be a little more serious but Ben Stiller did a great job here, using jokes wisely and appropriately, rather than a constant barrage of laughter.But the best message I got was that, after seeing this film, I need to be a little more exciting. You will see something in yourself that resembles a piece of Walter Mitty and that's what I liked most about this film. Everyone needs to live a little more, no matter who you are.If you've read the critics reviews, don't read any more. Go and enjoy a really good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's dismaying and disheartening to witness Ben Stiller's failed attempt at reworking and outdoing the story of "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty." With Norman Z. McLeod's 1947 adaptation (from a short story by James Thurber) brandishing numerous flaws and plenty of room for improvement, it's especially unacceptable that Stiller would be unable to best the previous incarnation ? or at least match it. There's no singing, very little slapstick, and seemingly limitless avenues of adventure to explore, but the frequent fantasy is almost always indistinguishable from the reality ? which makes the fantasy not inspiring enough and the reality far too unperceivable.Forgettable Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) frequents eHarmony.com in the hope of "winking" at recently hired coworker Cheryl Melhoff (Kristen Wiig). The problem is that he hasn't accomplished anything noteworthy or remarkable with which to fortify his dating profile. He's been a negative asset manager at "Life Magazine" for sixteen years, anonymously prepping photographs for inclusion, primarily from the unpredictably wild war photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn). When the declining company is acquired, the final issue of the magazine is slated for two-and-a-half weeks, with the meticulously bearded Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott) serving as the managing director (or hatchet man) of the transition to an online outlet.Mitty is given a new roll of film from O'Connell, with explicit instructions that negative #25, a quintessential image that represents his body of work, be used for the final cover. Despite careful handling, Mitty is unable to locate #25, leading him on a harrowing journey around the world and through treacherous landscapes to hunt down the unreachable photographer, trusting that the reckless man still possesses the missing negative. His trek leads him from Greenland, where he dives into freezing, shark-infested water from a helicopter piloted by an overgrown drunkard during sketchy weather conditions, to skateboarding across miles of downward sloping asphalt to an erupting Icelandic volcano, to the lower Himalayas and ungoverned Afghanistan.His impressive odyssey is plagued by a violent bar fight, a ravenous underwater predator, horny Chilean deckhands, and the elusive ghost cat at 18,000 feet up a mountainside. But none of this compares to his constant daydreaming, in which he stands up for himself to an uncaring, bullying executive ? by trading verbal insults or combating through the Time &amp; Life Building and transversely over the bustling streets of New York, like something out of "Spider-Man," augmented by gravity-defying computer graphics and exaggerated destruction. His continually wandering mind is intended to be the focus of his alternate life, but is rapidly dwarfed by the genuine perils he faces while following flimsy clues in search of Sean. Incidentally, he builds not only a more seductive dating profile, but also an inspiring resume.Included in the zoning out misadventures is an underdeveloped love story with Cheryl, a subplot of Mitty's slowly dwindling bank account, a sense of unfulfilled successes to embolden his father's pride, losing faith in himself, and the idea of a disconnected man struggling to interact effectively with humankind (not unlike this year's "Her"). There's also a peculiar, out-of-place spoof of "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button." But the result is a sloppy blend of half-hearted, rushed fantasy and unrealistic, unenthusiastic action (momentarily lifted by daredevilry-infused reveries with peppy music, though muddied by plot inconsistencies and poor editing). Gone is the truly oppressed, belittled, harried man from the source material, a target for mistreatment and a vicarious channel for flamboyant revenge and triumph.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ben Stillers worst film yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting more, this movie was a huge let down and the ratings were clearly paid.It starts off entertaining with Ben Stiller doing some online dating, which periodically comes back into the movie in forms of advertisements for an online dating site and serves little purpose to the overall movie in the end. Surprisingly, the online dating aspect scenes were some of the best parts of the film which served very little purpose to the overall plot of the film in the end, which was a shame because they could of made it work.The movie struggles back and forth between the advertising and the actual plot and the viewer is left wondering where the film is going. The overall plot and scenes simply didn't work. If the whole online dating ads weren't enough, the movie also throws in these "day dreams" which Ben Stiller has, which again serves no purpose to the plot and it keeps taking you in pointless directions.Half way through the movie, it try's to recover from the advertising and day dreaming, and drops it all together and the it try's to recover but fails miserably.The movie was trying to go in 2 separate directions and in the end it felt like you watched 2 unfinished movies.</fullReview>

Also, Kristen Wiig provides a great performance of Walter's secret crush. With Stiller writing, starring, and directing the film, He took on a huge role and fulfilled it completely. Along with the Oscar worthy camera work, and a fulfilling soundtrack, Expect Walter Mitty to be appearing on award shows everywhere. Don't listen to the critics. This is a great movie , with a great lesson to be learned. Just go out and get life. Don't wait for it to come to you .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should Have Remained The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller has so far this year had what may be called a 'quiet one', however fortunes look set to change with the latest blockbuster 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty'. Viewing of the trailer promises a touching and majestic piece of cinematography, a warm and heartfelt theme is vowed as Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) drifts in and out of his own nine-to-five mundane reality through increasingly outrageous and awesome daydreams? To which I'm sure many of us can relate.A film which is involved with routine, lost dreams and online dating has all the makings of a relatable canvas. Walter is a non-descript human, when asked to complete his online dating profile over the phone we are pulled into the first of many 'visions' where Walter emerges from a burning building only to claim the damsel ? in this case a colleague whom he has been following online for some time yet struggling to pluck up the courage to persuade her to even acknowledge his presence at Life Magazine ? the truth, Walter handles photos for Life Magazine.When Walter is eventually cornered into a conversation with the coveted Cheryl Melhoff played by the elegant and desirable Kristen Wiig his life comes to a crossroads as she challenges him as no-one has before. Walter sets off around the world ? la carpe diem in search of a photograph from the illusive photographer Sean O'Connor played effectively if only briefly by Sean Penn.There are moments of beauty and splendour as his travels see him traipse through Greenland, Iceland, submerged in the Atlantic Ocean and finally back to the office cubicle. Despite this, the film's script is ropey at best, when promising to deliver a picture of the 'quintessence of life' for the final issue of Life Magazine we are promised so much, unfortunately, the conclusion to the photo mystery is rather trite and aspects such as the closure of the magazine is trivialised by absurd characters.The problems with Walter Mitty's Secret Life is that the fantasies which both we and Walter experience eventually descend into the slapstick and satirical, forcing a film, which promises so much on an emotional level, to become farcical in so many manners.Breaking out from the restraints of his role as a 'negative asset manager' and blossoming one would expect Walter secret life to contain deep and meaningful means to an end, despite this Walter's secret life is riddled with hilarities such as an inebriated helicopter pilot and even moments on the Himalayas are trivialised as Walter searches out Sean only skimming the surface of emotional connection before moving swiftly on.It is hard not to get caught up in the energy of Walter Mitty's adventure, only to be let down when Stretch Armstrong and Bejamin Button 'sketches' are thrown into the equation. The film may stem from a short-story but that is no excuse for 'filler', the victim; sentimentality.Ben Stiller recently talked of his desire to be behind the camera as his zeal for screen time diminishes with a heightened desire to direct. A somewhat natural step, even if he hadn't confessed that in an interview it is very hard to escape that feeling while watching the tired and lacklustre 'feel-good' family Christmas film this year. Sorry kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At one point in all of our lives, we are bound to question the direction we are taking our lives, and the decisions we've made or haven't made. Some people live extremely sheltered, never getting witness some of the curveballs or left-hooks that life throws at. Thus, is the case of Walter Mitty, a LIFE magazine employee, who has day-dreams of himself performing heroic stunts and living a more adventurous life then he does now.LIFE Magazine is preparing to put out their last issue while transitioning into LIFE Online. Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) has lost a photo negative by legendary photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn), which is supped to be the last issues cover. Walter Mitty then sets out on a journey around the world to find Sean and the missing photo.Ben Stiller is truly at the top of his game. Stiller's acting is sensational, truly heart-felt and honest, there is not one scene that Stiller isn't in and he captures you and transports you into this fantastical journey. Kristen Wiig is sweet and relaxed as Walter's love interest. Wiig, who we all know is hilarious, prospers and glows as Cheryl Melhoff. Stiller and Wiig together are perfect, such great on-screen chemistry. Adam Scott as Walter's Boss, is irritating and hilarious. Patton Oswalt has a brief role, and has quite a few laughs. Sean Penn is also terrific, even though his character is mostly talked about, when his ten minute scene comes, you truly understand who he is.Ben Stiller's directing has never been more intriguing. Still takes an older story and brings it into the modern world, flawlessly. Still and Steve Conrad the films screenwriter, have adapted a film that the whole family can enjoy, even though it's aimed at an older audience. The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty is sure to garnish up Oscar buzz for directing and adapted screenplay. This is such a fun film, I can't remember a film with such a whole-hearted story that has done this well in a long time. I give The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty an "A+"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well thank goodness for Great Movie Experiences!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed Walter Mitty. Ben Stiller hit it out of the ballpark with this one. His acting style and expressions were perfect for the odd Mitty character. The comedic timing was very good and caught me off-guard most of the time...you know when you don't expect to laugh and then something so cute or funny causes you to crack up. Out loud. I was not too familiar with Kristen Wiig but her portrayal of Cheryl was spot on. She is interesting to look at and her demeanor really fit with Walter's. I enjoyed watching them interact. Shirley McLaine playing the mom was good, too. Actually I like Ms. McClaine's performances much better as a older woman than I did in her early movies. The CG stuff was not overdone and I did not see too many "oops" moments in this movie. You know the scenes where you can tell it was CG'd. I cannot end without giving kudos to Sean Penn. Another perfect casting choice as he played his character to a tee and was very believable. His ruddy, rough looks fit well with his character's profession.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know where to begin with this movie. The whole movie was masterfully directed, the acting was incredible, and the story awe- inspiring. Usually, I don't like to see "feel-good" movies because I think they are cheesy, (ahem Internship). But this did not give me any of that feeling. I enjoyed every second of it. Every shot was beautiful. No matter where Walter went, I felt like I was there. His daydreaming was very well done, and at times hilarious. The acting was superb, except for Adam Scott. He felt flaky and unreal, hence the 9 instead of 10. Other than that, amazing acting all around. The soundtrack was beautiful, and I loved every song that played. It fit perfectly with the mood of this movie. Finally, Ben Stiller was an amazing director. I can honestly say, without a doubt, that this is some of the best directing I have seen in years. He honestly deserves an Oscar, or at least a nomination. He handles the drama and story of this movie perfectly, at is a great non-comedy directorial debut.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty should have been heartwarming whimsical movie that I fell in love with, but instead frustrated me to no end. The biggest problem is that none of the characters act in a way that any relatable human being would, which culminates in a near end twist that really took me out of the movie. The parts that are clever or heartwarming come at the expense of being a paint-by-numbers cliché. The dialogue comes off as very awkward, which is intentional, but not the awkward that lends itself to good writing that someone like Joss Whedon can produce. I am sure that I will appreciate the message and the intent behind it, but I was too frustrated and bored to enjoy watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh dear oh dear oh dear. What should have been a truly enthralling, captivating and magical tale is here turned into product placement, CGI and reasons for the film crew to travel to odd and interesting places. Ben Stiller may have been the correct choice as Walter but for heavens sake, everything else is wrong. Simple things e.g. making the dream sequences black &amp; white would have made the story more 'genuine' - instead we and he can't decide what is true and what is imagined...to the extent that when he does have his real life adventures we don't care. In any case, by then we're looking at the scenery - nice, been to some of those places, nice to see them on screen. Pity the focus is on some stupid goings on that are just beyond far fetched (you know, a moon distance far fetched.)As a UK TV interviewer noted, "Ben, you have very long legs for the size of your body" well, what else could the poor guy talk about.

		<fullReview>Well, for starters, this is the typical movie I hate. Just went to see it because my wife wanted to.It depicts what is worst about Hollywood cinema. It is a pretty basic, popular and commercial movie. Add to this recipe a poor storyline, bad acting and pinches of no fun at all.The only aspect I've appreciated in this movie is filmography and photography which are both delightful, breathtaking, and ultimately shows why this planet should be explored entirely. It addresses places that we do not think about visiting very often as Greenland, Iceland and even Afghanistan.Ben Stiller proved to me at tops an average actor and a worse director, with all respect. Really think he could get back to old funny guy roles, that he had borne.Do no think about watching this movie if you are into dense story lines and characters progression or evolution. It is, most of the time, same old blablabla.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avoid the Tedious Life of Walter Mitty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a poor film.I was given free tickets to a preview of this film and I have to report that I have never seen as many people walk out of a film as I did with Walter Mitty.The plot is predictable and clichéd, relying too heavily on what is supposed to be a feel good factor (it isn't) and the quirky qualities of its lead characters (they aren't).Just to make it clear, this film isn't quirky, it's irritating, tedious and deeply frustrating. There are several problems with the film not least the central premise of the plot. For those of you who are unaware the Ben Stiller character regularly drifts off into flights of fantasy where he imagines he is a super hero, or an alpine ski God, or Benjamin Button and here is where the movie really loses its way. The 'dream' sequences are misjudged and out of place. They add nothing to the plot and actually take you away from the narrative of the main story. As a result when he drifts off it becomes increasingly frustrating as you just want the story to progress without the constant (and irritating) disruptions. As a result the story is unevenly paced, and you lose all sympathy for the lead character.While I am usually a big fan of Ben Stiller, he was miss cast as the nerdy office worker who is transformed into the would be hero in this misfiring story. His performance is wooden and he is not helped by a corny script, and the decision by the director to surround Walter Mitty with a series of parodies of office workers (the shy beautiful girl, the ball busting out of touch boss, the put upon overweight co-worker etc).The film seems confused as to who is its audience, and as a result it falls between several stools. It isn't really a comedy, a art house movie, a drama or a romance.This was one of the least enjoyable experience I have ever had at the cinema.Avoid, just avoid.</fullReview>

E Harmony is the first in a long line of adds. The movie is over the top with the day dream sequences and (of course) C.G.I. is used in abundance. It is well photographed (if you like scenery this is your film) , but is this a comedy ?? The use of the name Walter Mitty is the only (sick) joke I can think of. The guy who came up with that was thinking ONLY of the novelty (and the money).Mitty is used in many dictionaries...after Danny Kayes wonderful performance in the REAL FUNNY Secret life of Walter Mitty. This is sure to be a success. (Yes, that's how poor it is)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most insightful PG movie since 2001: A Space Odyssey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, film buffs can call me out on this one... "2001: A Space Odyssey" was actually rated G. But you get what I mean. Sometime after the late 90s, G and PG (and even many PG13) movies became synonymous with Disney kid stuff, while if you wanted some depth and "adult" fodder it generally came with a lot of disturbing, angsty, profane and graphically violent/sexual stuff. "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is a great throwback to films geared at adults, provoking deep thought, while remaining firmly family-friendly.I'm not sure why that's so significant I had to open my review with it, but maybe you'll get the gist. This is a film that tells a simple story without flashy, gritty plot sensations, and yet it doesn't treat you like you're an idiot for watching a PG movie. And although I'm something of a cynical old geezer, I'm sure kids can enjoy it and find just as much meaning as I did.Walter Mitty is a dork. Not quite a loser because he has a good job and is quite capable, but, well, the opening scene of him struggling for 5 minutes to click a "wink" button on a dating site ought to tell you he's not exactly captain of the football team.From there we learn that he has an odd habit of zoning out in his own fantasy world because obviously his real life bores him (and everyone around him) to tears. But that doesn't last long. Suddenly a bizarre mystery appears, and as you may have guessed from the trailers and movie posters, the film involves dorky Walter (Ben Stiller) trekking across continents and doing battle with all sorts of disasters as well as drunk Icelandic pilots.There's also a mild romance brewing (so he wishes) between himself and his coworker Cheryl (Kristen Wiig), but this is not a formulaic romcom. It's really about trying to get the most out of life. And whether you're a middle aged career schmoe like Walter, or I dunno, a punk rocker or a soccer mom, the message will appeal to you because it's about finding adventure everywhere it exists.The humor keeps things rolling nicely, but don't expect anything zany like Ben Stiller's earlier "The Cable Guy" and "Zoolander" or really any of his films. This movie is basically a serious tale, complete with nice artistic touches and GORGEOUS cinematography, peppered with Stiller's quirky tongue-in-cheek humor the whole way.I have to add a word about the music. Oh the soundtrack kills. If you are versed in the 80s classics like Hall &amp; Oates "Maneater", Rupert Holmes "The Pina Colada Song", and a great appearance of David Bowie's "Space Oddity" you will love the tunes. There's also a modern classic or two, such as Of Monsters and Men "Dirty Paws". Something for everyone.I was really impressed with Ben Stiller's directoral maturity and the way he kept things fresh and breezy despite this being a serious soul-searcher. In that respect I was reminded of one of my favorite directors Wim Wenders (his later films such as "Million Dollar Hotel" and "Lisbon Story"). There's also, as I mentioned, a quirky tongue-in-cheek attitude throughout, reminding me of Paul Thomas Anderson's "Punch Drunk Love"."The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is well worth the price of admission. Take your kids. Or kids, take your parents. There's something for everyone.</fullReview>

If you have seen any family Hollywood "comedy" in the past 15 years, you know exactly what's gonna happen, honestly. Now take the word comedy with a grain of salt because I don't even think I cracked a smile at any of the terribly unfunny PG humour. I don't get how anyone older than 10 can watch this movie and wonder what will happen in the end. Right from the get-go it was blatantly obvious that he would get the girl and he wouldn't lose his job. Any "conflict" or "tension" feels so fake and forced because you know nothing bad will happen to the protagonist (how dare a movie be original for once!?). I am not saying you are stupid if you like/enjoy this movie, I could see how it could be an okay family popcorn flick, but anyone who wants anything more than that will be horribly disappointed. All in all, I just could not bring myself to enjoy it. It gains some points for some pretty awesome cinematography, and the acting was pretty good, but it just feels like I have seen this movie 1000 times already.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I get the appraise for this movie. It's a total eyegasm. I mean it's really, really, REALLY beautiful.But the plot? Eh. Well, for starters the entire plot is massively damaged. A dreamer, having his day dream fantasies (almost) come true. Yep, something you can relate to. Touching and what not. But in this movie? You'll be yawning at the plot.The entire reason for Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller's character) to go to such extremes and have these experiences is totally fraud. You don't climb the Himalayas/fight a shark/go to a volcano and escape it's eruption.. Do all the life risking adventurous things just because of a stupid negative to a stupid photograph. Even if your job is on the line.Okay, let's assume you might and it's totally justified to do so (it isn't). When you get fired for failing to do so, you don't go out still solving the crappy mystery and cross mountains to find the photograph. I mean, what do you need it for now? It's over. Closure? At that cost? Pass.Anyway, he does.Next flaw, cell reception EVERYWHERE? Seriously? Loud and clear cell reception, EVERYWHERE? On even the near top of the Himalayas? Must be a hell of a network company. Next up. If you are paying 500$ a month to a dating site and have a doubt, yes they will entertain you when you contact them. But I hardly believe they will keep on calling you every other day to "check up" on you, even if you clarified your doubts the first time. Like, would you? How many clients? All of them? You'll call them everyday? Would your company even let you? I don't think so? What company does that? They're there for you if you need them, but not to check up on you every single day. They won't come and identify you at the airport if you are stuck in the airport prison cause you can't prove your identity. You are paying for a subscription to a site. Not to buy a full-time mom.And here's another one. This is the last one. The "photograph/negative" finding plot, has "THE ALCHEMIST by PAULO COHELO" written all over it. At least the novel had the guts to put it entirely into a fantasy zone by even making the final destination as a "treasure" he dreams of one night. At least it worked in the fantasy world. This one borders around the fantasy world but wants us to believe in the reality of it, and fails to do so because of the stupidity of the plot/premise.I mean, I get it, "It's about the journey... blah", but I mean, come on? Seriously? If you wanted an adventure so bad, you'd have done it without the extremely lame reason of searching for a "ghost cat" (let's quote the movie), through the entire world.To summarize, If you want to look at beauty, like epic settings, beautiful exotic terrains, go for it. If you want a working plot, just pass. Don't opt for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film starts out with a lot of promise: the first fantasy sequence on the subway platform, tied in with the eHarmony bit (this movie sure has a lot of blatant product placements) was great, as were Stiller &amp; Wiig's initial performances. But then the hammer falls with the overcooked overacted cliché scenes of office down-sizing, followed by some vague ill-defined vision quest after the nebulous Sean Penn character (a heroic photographer?) mixed in with nonsense about skateboarding (pandering to a very specific demographic I guess) &amp; some kind of non-ending. Biggest problem was the film-makers lost focus early on vis-a-vis what was fantasy &amp; what was reality which is what The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is really about.This made me think of a Tom Hanks &amp; Meg Ryan movie that had the same theme but was a thousand times better: Joe versus the Volcano.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Among other problems with this movie, is the plain fact that Ben Stiller's Walter Mitty possesses no character appeal. He's a cipher, and in being played as such evokes, for me, little in the way of empathy or, worse, interest. If he loses his job at Life magazine or gets the girl is of no account, whatsoever. The proxy for this dullard's boring existence is his vivid fantasy life, wherein the mild-mannered Mitty transforms himself into all manner of heroic beings. Mitty's heroics are created using all of the Hollywood slight-of-hand available, and instantly produce a kind of superhero Mitty, because of course, we can never have enough of super heroes and never enough of special effects. These manufactured effects do little to compensate for the story, which is still quite a bore, and is built around the flimsiest of plot. The fact that his fantasy world is created using various sort of computer generated gimmicks makes Mitty less interesting, not more because there's no real person there. He becomes even more remote and one-dimensional as a character. When Mitty later breaks out of his shell, and goes on his pilgrimage to recover the lost film slide, he becomes a completely different human being - heroic in a different, and if less computer animated way, still no more plausible. There's no transformation of character, no nuance whatsoever in how the meek and timid Mitty suddenly becomes a kind of Bear Grillis, and the leap of faith is simply too much to accept. Worse even, Stiller doesn't even try to play to that. Stiller plays Stiller the action figure, making the whole abbreviated excercise of super-hero fantasy excess turned survival adventurer a hackneyed excercise in clumsy and unrealistic story-telling. I can forgive a plot that's slender and fare that's light-hearted at best, but the utter artlessness of this film makes it one to avoid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>established his work conditions, his love interest, "he don't get no respect", some decent imaginings using CGI that Danny Kaye could only have dreamed about, really decent beginning. About that time I started thinking, OK they only have an hour left, how are they going to get him in all these situations the trailer shows him in if they don't get going. Well, for this crowd it wasn't hard. He decides to go to Greenland, on the spur of a moment, and within 15 seconds he's there. Horrible transition, actually no transition. And it's like that for the rest of the film. Had lots of great potential, was living up to it, then it went all to pieces. Disappointing to say the least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie of 2014</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this on DVD at the urging of my 14 year old daughter. I was blown away and wish I had seen it in the theater when it was released. I have watched it about 10 times now. It is just perfectly done. If you are familiar with Joseph Campbell and any of his writing on mythology then you will love how this story follows the hero myth so wonderfully. This movie is now in my top 5 all time most loved movies. As I said the story is superb and so is the acting. Ben Stiller really brings this to life and I think it is the best role he has ever done. Although this is not an hysterical comedy like you are used to seeing him in, he brings a great deal of subtle humor to keep the story light and entertaining, but at the same time he gives a very real performance. His Mitty is not two dimensional but a real person you can relate to. I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously, never thought my perspective for b stiller will change because of this. I love comedy esp American comedy but even i hate to admit this i gotta say Ben stiller and Adam Sander are two of the comedians i despise from Hollywood to which i don't know why.. Maybe because i find them over reacting as well as overrated and not funny at all. Anyways back to the review. I never thought Ben stiller will be cast for this movie to which at first this movie is a more inspiration genre and not a comedy.but i was amazed cause i didn't thought like Zack bra-ff, b stiller can also be a good director and an actor at the same time that i gotta admit this movie inspires me that in-spite of setbacks and doubts,if we got the guts and the will power to overcome anything that will comes along our way, we can still be successful even full of bumpy road ahead is what waiting for us. I know I'm not in the position to say this is the best movie or version comparing to the 1947 film of same title since i wasn't able to make a comparison.but the fact that this movie has a high rating here in IMDb as well as the reviews made by co-members i really felt relief cause finally i realize I'm not weird though my mother who also watch this movie was disappointed with my taste since she doesn't enjoy it at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Product Placement Peppers Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would certainly have rated this movie higher if it weren't for the many overt product placements. There were a number of scenes that were really funny. One reason I rarely go to movie theatres anymore is because of the commercials beforehand. By 67 minutes into the movie, Papa Johns had been cited visually or verbally at least 9 times - the male and female leads were having a conversation about Papa Johns at one point! Let's not forget the E-Harmony repeated mentions! Then, there was KFC, Facebook, Time Life... I recognize that directors/producers are trying to finance films. However, the film is becoming a vehicle for advertising. Unlike where TV commercials are separated from TV show content, this blurring and blending of commercials and content in movies is both insidious and increasingly bold and in-your-face! I can thoroughly enjoy the best of international commercials. However in this movie, the persistence of product placement served to overpower and trump the narrative at times for me, disrupting the flow and my connection to it.</fullReview>

There are brief moments of good comedic writing. Disliked: Stiller and Wiig try hard to act extra normal and slightly awkward, but come off stilted in an unfunny, dreadful way. Mostly boring dialog throughout. Zero chemistry between Stiller and Wiig. Most importantly, with the exception of the drunk pilot and Stiller's stunt double, everyone in the movie seems to have had the energy sucked out of them. Sad, lifeless acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoyable drama comedy, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a well crafted film, that I felt was well acted and paced and Ben Stiller was terrific here, and he also directs. Although the film is a bit slow, the tone and story is quite good, and I was surprised at how good the film is. Ben Stiller does some fine work here, and he is more than able to craft something a bit more dramatic in tone than his previous works such as Tropic Thunder and Zoolander. The film is entertaining for what it is, and it's a film that really shows off Stiller's directorial talents. With that being said, I'm an anxious to see what he'll make next, as the film is engaging, well acted and directed. The film does have a few weaker moments that could have been improved upon, but for the most part, it's a film that is well worth your time if you're looking for an effective drama. What I enjoyed the most about the film was of course, Ben Stiller's performance, and I thought he handled the dramatic element perfectly, and he shows off his range as an actor, as he opts for a more serious affair than his usual output. I really enjoy Ben Stiller, loved most of his comedies, and it's always refreshing to me to see a comedic actor attempt something more serious, and it's always a treat when a genre actor like Ben Stiller who is more famous for comedies step out of his comfort zone, and attempt something quite different than what we are used to. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is not a great movie, but it's still an accomplished drama for what it does, and with an actor like Stiller acting and directing, we get something quite good and unique as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superficial and narcissistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller's remake of 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' is like a Lands End catalog set to Enya music. It's just a profoundly shallow and utterly narcissistic film masquerading as something deep. Once you get beyond the beautiful scenery and artistic flourish, it's really just a heap of New Age pap. It might as well be called "Generation X: The Movie".Beyond the superficial soul searching, 'Mitty' also fails when it comes to its hook; Walter's daydreams. The problem is that most of them feel more like comedy skits than actual daydreams, and only a couple of times do they further the narrative or flesh out the character.If you like your soul searching thimble-deep, with a hint of sandalwood, this New Age take on 'Walter Mitty' is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's always a little strange watching a movie on a long-haul airplane flight: you are often slightly disoriented and depending on whether you are heading home or outbound, probably in a more attuned emotional state. Nevertheless, I flicked onto 'Mitty' as the second film of the second leg of a long flight with low expectations, having heard the negative reviews last year. Boy, was I wrong? ?admittedly these next comparisons might seem crass but apparently 'Shawshank' was panned when it first appeared and I still believe that only time will prove what a wonderful piece of art 'The Mission' was? and 'Mitty' probably isn't in that league. But equally I thought it was an exceptionally well made and creative film: my attention was caught from the first scenes and the way that the initial titles were presented (I'll not spoil the details, but do look carefully). The artwork/ cinematography is excellent and while Ben Stiller might not be to everyone's taste, I felt that he found exactly the right balance of pathos and comedy here to do justice to the script and the central ideas of the film.It's the kind of film that draws you in slowly and you certainly don't get the impression from the first third just where the film will end up but if you are one of 'us' who think that 'feel-good' is a good place to be, then please do get and see this film. By turns its comedic, romantic and I think that it is actually self-deprecating ? hardly Stiller's main characteristic in previous works! ? and that anyone who is looking for a deeper message or the 'meaning of life' (sorry for the pun) is actually being had: Mitty is a filmic fantasy and should just be enjoyed for the moment, which is in effect to quote Sean Penn's character in the film I guess.The negative reviews on here ? and there are several ? when you look closely take exception to specific elements of the film but miss the wider message and that I think is what will come across over time. It's a lovely film and certainly one that will grow in popularity over time once it starts appearing on terrestrial television? maybe it will never pay back its initial budget but don't let that put you off... it's a little gem.</fullReview>

It was one of those feel good type stories, and it really brings you in it and doesn't let go till the end, feeling all happy and satisfied and mushy. Ben Stiller was awesome in this film. It was really surprising to see him in a not-so-comedy role. The rest of the cast was good too. Sean Pean's little screen time was utilized perfectly. That whole scene with him had this awesome feel to it.The cinematography in this film was great. The shots of Iceland and Afghanistan (or whatever place it was actually shot in) were immensely beautiful. These shots were complemented by a great soundtrack and the combination just swept me away. BEAUTIFUL!!The movie might seem slow for the first 30 mins or so but don't let that turn you off. This movie blossoms into a beautiful adventure that will surely mesmerize you.

		<shortDescription>A Beautifully Crafted Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty is one of those movies that slipped through my radar. I regularly keep up with the movies coming each year, but like a few others that had me enthralled, The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty was one of the few movies that I didn't notice. I believe that the movies that we don't always notice, the movies that we don't always think about, are the movies that's going to hunt our minds for some time after having seen them.I am pretty sure that The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty is one of those movies. I am writing this review a day after having seen it and I am still amazed at the way it was directed, the way the score of the movie simply makes my soul stop.The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty can be considered a remake of a movie from the 40's but the story is a lot different from the 40's movie, and what it borrows isn't much. I think that was a good decision. I am not saying that the original movie isn't a good one, I am just saying that whereas the 2013 takes a very different turn it fits and probably fits better than if they had decided to use the original story, as the original story was crafted way back and the mindset of today is quite different.The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty as mentioned is a movie released in 2013, it was directed by Ben Stiller, and he stars in the movie as Walter Mitty. The movie revolves around Walter Mitty who is a dreamer, so much so that it affects his life. He day-dreams about various things during the movie. When his life and the lives of the people around him is threatened he decides to seek out the person that might be able to help him or at least wake him up. In the end this in term sends him out on an adventure, he only dreamed about in his day-dreams.Ben Stiller is perfect as the day-dreaming Walter Mitty. Ben Stiller can now and then seem quite hard to shallow, sometimes his humor is over the top or just rather annoying, and if you are a person who cannot get over that fact, and you believe that you are never really going to enjoy what he does, it's time to give it another go. I have bashed on Ryan Reynolds many times before, I said I couldn't get into the movies he did, many of them seemed so annoying, and then something happened. Ryan Reynolds changed his direction towards more serious and I guess more developed scripts.I am not saying that I do not like movies that star Ben Stiller, I enjoyed the older ones and some of the new ones, but I also want to see him do something a little different I also want to see him turn into what Ryan Reynolds became with some of his newer movies. That's exactly what I got with The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty. Ben Stiller's performance was amazing, and in comparison to other movies he felt real. Ben Stiller captures something not seen all the time, he truly plays Walter Mitty as a real life person, and his emotions are something not seen that often.Of course there are other actors in this movie and while they do give the movie that extra spark and they are all doing an amazing job the movie is mostly centered on Ben Stiller, the story is about his character and he is what you are going to be seeing throughout 85% of the movie. Therefore I just want to go record saying that the other actors are well placed and they give that extra feeling that the person needs, they also complement Ben Stiller's character in a beautiful way.I felt the direction of the movie was spot on, the camera work is just right and the visuals of the movie is at times mesmerizing.Every scene was perfectly captured and just beautiful. For once I didn't notice too many camera cuts, maybe I just was too into the movie to notice, but if that was the reason then who cares, if they could give me that special feeling of exactly watching a movie and being drawn in to it then that's more than enough, that's more then what anyone could ask for. The movie is beautifully crafted, the art direction is perfect, and while some scenes are somewhat fake it still felt real and truly mesmerizing.The Score of the movie created by Theodore Shapiro &amp; Jose Gonzalez was perfectly composed to all of the scenes, the soundtrack isn't anything out of the ordinary, but the score is somewhat else. From the humming sound in the track "I'm Right Here" to the more heavy orchestral theme of "Stationary Cycle" every track just comes together to create a wonderfully masterpiece crafted by a steady and calm soul.You may be inclined to look at the beautifully crafted visuals more than listen to the music, it all depends on the viewer but for me the music just came in to create something special, something alive, something soul and heart wrenching.The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty is something else, it's something special, it's one of the movies that went past my radar for some odd reason and while it may not be for everyone it's defiantly something that moves this sometimes old and rusty heart. It's a journey into the soul and heart of the one who truly believes that life can be more then what it sometimes is.It's about taking chances, it's about waking up, it's about trying new things, it's about looking from other views, it' about realizing what's behind the covers, it's about life!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I get serious I'll say this was a nice movie. It was interesting and fun to watch, but at times the movie lost me with character development. I think overall, it could have been better and shows "Ben Stiller's influence" as he was the director. I like Ben Stiller but he shouldn't have been directing this movie but I did like his acting.I did not like the writing though and I found the moment when the character throws away the wallet completely out of character. It was a poor decision and only a vehicle to create drama. Any time I can predict the ending of the movie within the first 1/3rds of the movie the writing is poorly done. I actually predicted at the moment the characters were looking for negative #25 I said to my family, "It's in the wallet". Doh.I haven't read the original short story but from what I can see on Wikipedia it appears to be a much better story and I'm looking forward to reading it.Over all I can't give this movie high marks and I'll never want to own it on DVD.Directing 0 Acting 1 Cinematography 1 Soundtrack 1 Script -1Overall 2/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for this movie I was really excited. It looked like an modernized terry Gilliam movie with spectacular visuals and imagination. And on that front the movie succeeded. Every shot in this movie is just gorgeous, Ben stiller's directing really gave this movie an almost dreamlike feel. But sadly this movie also contains flaws (in my opinion). First of all, although all the shots and dream-sequences look spectacular, they don't always fit as well in the story, some scenes seems to be just there as an excuse to go crazy, which is fine, but they feel kinda unnecessary as they don't really add much to the story or characters, I mean Okay we know Walter really, really likes the girl, you don't need 5 dream-scenes to establish that. secondly Adam Scott's beard is hilariously badand lastly, it can get kinda cliché at times.I know it seems like I'm bashing this movie as there are more cons than pros. But I liked this movie, I just feel kinda divided, because it looks beautiful, there where some funny moments, but it just feels like the movie is trying to be deeper or more meaningful than it is.So yeah Walter Mitty 7/10It's a fun, gorgeous movie, just don't take it too seriously, and if you do, nothing wrong with that, I agree with the message the movie's portraying, just feel its kinda too simple for something as complex as life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a lot of films that rely on an overload of imagery, they often fall at the final hurdle...that hurdle being a story of substance that can stand alone on its own merit regardless of the stylish, most of the time, over the top effects that seem to occupy the bulk of today's films. Ben Stiller's dreamy triumph of an everyday office worker who seeks global adventure at times dabbles with flashy and intentionally wild dream-like scenarios, but the plot always manages to remain the prominent focal point for the audience. When an international publishing company informs there staff of impending job cuts, Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) goes to ultimate extreme's to save his career. As we witness Walter's ambitious journey of heroism, and in the end redemption, his simplest quest of dating co-worker Cheryl (Kristen Wiig) is the one quest he feels the most daring. From stunning scenery to unique and original set's and odd ball characters, 'The secret life of Walter Mitty' amazes, inspires and makes us want to take a giant leap of faith.</fullReview>

And I can summarize about the movies at all (as a part of the arts) ? they give hope and in Platon way they reflect the reality in order to make us better understand it.What is the life of the artist? It is a man that can reflect life through himself and to give it back. Classical example: Dostoyevsky. Man who see life and make it again in his work.Truly. At the end, it is a matter of how important is to feel alive. And how important are the details, the small things, insignificant people, which we bypass on the daily streets. Naturally and as most important, the significance of the mother (and father)! Without which we would not be here.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

The music was amazing and the cinematography was spectacular as well. It had these lovely little touches that made it stand out from the average movie of this genre.Don't go in thinking you're going to see the usual Stiller movie though. Keep an open mind and enjoy it.

In fact, I never felt like Walt grew as a character. He regressed back to his teenage self. And perhaps that is my disconnect.the one moment that you were hoping for, Walt telling off his boss, never really hit home as one might expect. Instead it was the exact thing his boss needed to hear.as a final moment of valor, it was WEAK! But the final shot, negative #25, very predictable, but satisfying.

		<fullReview>After seeing the reviews I decided to see the movie. The scenery was spectacular and the story line fine if you suspend disbelief a bit. The ending where Mitty ends up on the cover ( hey, what about the other employees?) was a bit much to swallow, but the theme of getting out of your comfort zone and taking a chance resonated with most viewers, I think. Sean Penn was good as the adventurer/photographer and Stiller was surprisingly good playing a dramatic role, although sometimes the movie seems split between trying to be a comedy and trying to play it straight. I'm sorry, but skating down mountain sides on a skateboard is completely outrageous and unbelievable, and this is what I mean by the split nature of the movie - played for laughs as something outrageous it would have worked, but to believe that this meek guy who worked at a pizza chain and then at the magazine could also somehow be a world class skater.....The people with me thought the movie was too slow - I think they expected either a comedy or a hair raising adventure kind of like Indiana Jones.

		<shortDescription>Not Really the Ogden Nash Walter Mitty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is problematical. The cinematography is extraordinary. The movie is a travelogue taking the viewer to remote and scenic places. Mitty departs from the short story written by Ogden Nash in almost every way possible. The original Mitty was married to a carping spouse who had no patience for his day dreaming. Ben Stiller's Mitty is a single man who works at Life Magazine where he is charge of the inventory of film negatives. Stiller's Mitty, like the original, drifts into elaborate fantasies. He is, in real life, a quiet, invisible corporate drone who does his job and lives a quiet life. The pacing and tone of this movie is inconsistent, which is usually the fault of the editor. At times, it feels like a drama; sometimes, it is comedic. One would expect this story to be a poignant comedy, like the short story. Instead, the film tries to make Witty into an action hero. The script is illogical in important ways that detract from the story. Witty's quest, for most of the film, is to find a lost negative. He travels to Greenland, Iceland and climbs into the Himalayas to find the man who shot the photograph he lost. When he finally locates the object of his quest, he chooses not to look at it. Who, in the human race, does that? Another plot problem occurs when he travels to Iceland where he is present for the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull, an eruption which disrupted air traffic around the world and caused temperatures to drop around the globe. Witty goes to the edge of the volcano, but gets a ride away from the eruption. A few hours later, he is at a Papa John's Pizza some miles away from the volcano. He calls his girl, but he says relatively little about the eruption. There is no volcanic dust, and no one seems to be troubled by the thing that just happened. The principal parts were consistently underacted, creating a flat emotional tone running through the movie. The flat tone stood in contrast to death-defying events. Kristen Wig and Stiller appeared to be mirror images of each other's emotional tone - both extremely under acting. There were some very funny scenes. The bit with eHarmony paid off nicely, and Patton Oswald added laughs. The ending was predictable as the conflicts resolved quickly into a romance that had been foreshadowed from the first minutes of the film.I didn't hate it. The music and the photography worked. There were flashes of brilliance and humor in the script, but the story did not hold together at important moments. There should have been some difference between Wig and Stiller's character styles. It was a mistake to have them mirror each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romcom, travelogue or skateboarding flick?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Mitty, the nerd with a strong fantasy life. This nerd chases a missing photo negative (google it) across the North Atlantic and Middle East only to find he had it all along, and his mother saves it from the trash. Ben Stiller's film lurches from genre to genre. One minute it's hyper-CGI superhero, next it's Greenland/Iceland/Afghanistan travelogue, then it's a divorcée romantic comedy. Oh, and not to forget the junior employee who gives venture capitalism back its humanity. And grows a beard, just like the bad guys.In this version of the James Thurber (google that, too) story, Walter is also an ex-punk ace skateboarder, which allows him not only to connect with his single-mother love interest, but also to pursue Sean Penn across Iceland.TSLOWM isn't bad, but it's strange. Its heart is in the right place, but the script is overambitious, trying to accommodate CGI, world travel, finance-free romance and the 'quintessence of life' on a pretty flimsy premise. See 'Billy Liar' for a better treatment of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mitty: a re-imagining done right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have long enjoyed the Danny Kaye version of this film (same title), so I was curious to see where this one would go. While wildly different movies, I feel that this Mitty is a thorough and fair re-imagining. I have recently witnessed the second Hobbit movie where many defenders are desperately trying to justify Jackson's path as a re-imagining, and I can only say - Watch these 2 Mitty movies to see how it is done. While very different in their stories, their commonalities inspire comparison. If I had to pick more thematic brethren, I would say Stranger Than Fiction is the closest that I have seen, with perhaps Turtle Diary another.I don't think that this is an awesome movie, except with cinematography, but I feel that it has been fairly placed by the voting public. Definitely well above average, and most enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Many Subtle Easter Eggs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the most beautiful movies I've been, both story-wise, and cinematography. From the moment the opening scene started the shots are inspiring. The composition is perfect; it's like seeing the world through rose colored lens. Immediately the color of sapphire blue was dialed up in every shot. The blue walls, the blue calculator buttons, checkbook, blue shirt, blue kitchen, blue website. The eyes of Ben Stiller, as well as the critical characters in the movie were brightened a la "The Host" but in a more realistic way. Yet, you would only notice if you looked through the lens of "life." The whole movie, the graphics felt natural. They flowed and enhanced the movie in subtle ways rather than distract and detract. Movies like Lord of the Rings, Transformers, etc. should take note on how the proper use of CGI. But ultimately it's the great story about "Life" that deserves your "Time."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Great Movie, Ben Stiller made a masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw one of the most brilliant movies by Ben Stiller. Its called The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Although some may have different opinions about the film, it was fantastic. The beauty of the film was about a man who struggles with self assurance and opening his eyes and mind to the possibilities of finding who he really is within. With a little romance and a little comedy, the film is something you can take home with you in your heart that says, I can be more than what the world says I am, and I am not afraid to take risks that open my eyes to who I could be. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys being inspired to explore yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't remember being so surprised by a movie. It really moved me like none other in years. It's a little far-fetched at times, but why not? Fiction should be. It does not pretend to be realistic at all times, but it tells a story that has a beginning and an end, and you leave feeling good, with a little brighter view on things for the few hours that follow. Kudos to Ben Stiller. - he has stepped out of the 'Zoolander'/'Dodgeball'/'Something About Mary' box (all fine movies - well two of them) and proved himself as a well-rounded actor (and director!). I would say if you liked 'Forrest Gump', 'Benjamin Button, and 'Big Fish' you'll love this. Go see it - you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly Entertaining, but Ultimately, a Bit Vapid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From time to time, I'm thankful that Aldous Huxley coined the term "feelie" to describe a movie that thinks it can dispense with artful narrative and bull through with breathtaking scenery, general film technique, disconnected comedic chops, and "aw, shucks" sentimentality. If Thurber saw "Walter Mitty", I'm sure he'd agree that it's a feelie.I'm not saying it's a bad movie, just that it's not a good one; certainly not a great one. Tone is mismanaged, which is inevitable when you mold a script, paper mache-like, over the scaffolding of Thurber's concept, with a mere handful of plotty-twisty elements thrown in; like the rather tepid will-they-or-won't-they romantic interest that feels like it fizzled long before it arrived.In general, all the hard work folks did on this flick was doomed to mediocrity by lame scenario work and scripting--which I have no doubt was executed with great valor under looming deadlines, but still, "no cigar".A side negatory: The product placement really stuck out like a sore thumb; sorta adds to the "feelie" factor, as well....The good stuff? Some great scenes; some wonderful acting, much by unknowns; occasional swashbuckling adventure action stuff that was kinda fun to watch; I found the unexpected intrusions of the e-Harmony support guy to be a hoot. I enjoyed the scenes with Penn; he's a matchless professional.I would tend to recommend that you not waste your time, IFF you feel your movie-going time is precious, and prefer really *great* flicks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty is an extremely frustrating film to review. It's a film that as I sit here typing, I realize made me more mad than any other film of the 21st century thus far. This may make me sound like I completely hated it. On the contrary, it's so frustrating because I could not quite reach the level of hating it. This is due to the fact that there are two or three incredibly profound moments spread wildly throughout the film that made me think "why can't the whole film be like this?" This is made all the more maddening by the fact that director and star Ben Stiller along with screenwriter Steve Conrad who did the excellent The Weather Man and the grossly overlooked The Promotion are obviously trying as hard as they can to make a great film. From the start---one can even see the strain in Stiller's face to make a truly remarkable film. Unfortunately, the film he has made is anything but.Read the full review at http://jackpollinsandthemovies.blogspot.com/2014/01/the- secret-life-of-walter-mitty-review.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes we need to step out and take a risk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not sure how to really approach this movie, but to give you a quick overall impression if it I would have to say that I did enjoy it. This film (I will refer to it simply as 'the Secret Life') is about a man who has been doing the same job for all of his life, lives in the same apartment, and when he signs up to an internet dating site and is asked to describe himself, he simply says 'not much'. There is something about Walter Minty though, and that is that he is a day dreamer, and he does so in the most inopportune moments (such was when he is on the phone to somebody, or is being asked questions by his boss). This, I must admit, I found to be a little unbelievable because, being a bit of a day dreamer myself, I would have to say that I generally do not drift off into my own little world when I am engaged in conversation with somebody (though I may do it when I am with a group of people, though not actively engaged in the conversation).What this film is about is about going out and living life, taking risks, and taking that step so that you might actually have some meaning in it. Many of us get caught up in the standard day by day monotony of our lives, and to be honest, many of us may not be in the situation (having a family to look after for instance) to enable us to start taking risks. However some of us actually will say 'stuff this, I am going to do something with my life' and actually take the risk.When people speak about this movie they seem to talk about the amazing scenery and the exotic locations, however to me it is about how one man took that step to move away from his humdrum life and to actually go out and experience the world. We see that running alongside his relationship with Cheryl in that at the beginning he is basically stalking her (or wanting to stalk her) on an internet dating site, but as the movie progresses, and he begins to step out of his shell, we see him actually forming a real relationship with her as well as no longer day dreaming. We also notice how he meticulously follows his budget, but then discovers, as he goes out and experiences the world, the budget no longer matters. In fact, upon his return to America, he even stands up to the customs officials when they confront him with the fact that he has been to Afghanistan.This is actually a remake of an older movie (which I would not have known if it was not for the wonders of the internet) and I would actually like to see that film as well, but I don't think that film deals with the concept of taking a risk, stepping out, and doing something new. Sometimes we have to have a strong idea of what we want to do, a passion, and a desire, and in many of us that exists. My passion is writing, and thinking, and creating stories and ideas, and I am looking for ways of actually monetising it. The truth with our society is that we need money to survive, and while it would be great to simply throw everything to the wind and go an enjoy life, the reality is that many of us are trapped in our world with no way out. I guess what this movie teaches us is that when we do see a way out, to step out and take it, and to enjoy life. Don't sit down and day dream, but turn those dreams into a reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capturing the "Quitenssence" of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller's latest directing film was based on James Thurber's short story in 1939 depicting the illusive fantasy of Walter Mitty (who is a negative asset manager), trying to flee away from every day routine's confinement. Ted Hendricks (played by Adam Scott) played the obnoxious antagonist of the film while the company was facing a huge downsizing since its corporate takeover which made Life Magazine's coming issue as its last. Yet, the owner and photojournalist, Sean O'Connell urged insistently that negative 25 would be the cover of final print of last ever issue of Life magazine which seemed to be misplaced elsewhere. Mitty is enforced to live out of his fantasy to embark on a journey seeking for the missing photograph from the prominent photographer.Mitty who is introduced as an ordinary working class man, living a dull, unadventurous life who suffered from his "zoned out" syndrome, fantasizing himself drawing into the most treacherous situations out of the orthodox life of his own. "The common man" theme has already built a crucial connection with the audience, as Mitty often restrained himself as a stereotypical worker in the bureaucratic society nowadays who many may daydreamed and romanticized his own living into an idyllic fiction. Mitty reminded me of Kevin Spacey's Lester Burnham in American Beauty, who is a depressed ordinary working class who had an eccentric affection for his daughter's friend. Mitty is in his 40's, in the pursuit of a companion on an online dating website and most notably that he was affectionate to his new colleague Cheryl Melhoff played by Kristen Wiig. Though this idea might seem a bit old school, Melhoff is critical drive to the story of how Mitty climb through the obstacles ahead of him. Kristen Wiig has the quality of modesty and elegance in her whom a good match with her role as the inspirational figure behind Walter's inner mindset.Throughout the film, Mitty moved from spots to spots to pursue for the treasurable negative 25 and ascent numerous struggles. Yet, his first real test intrigued me the most when he fumbled whether to proceed to the ship or not. The film decided to adopt an eminent song to convey the courage needed to achieve things. The introduction of David Bowie's "Ground Control To Major Tom" was a stroke of genius as the song was about courage and taking a leap out of your comfort zone which fits in flawlessly with the scene when Mitty hurdled through his own struggles and got abroad of the drunken man's helicopter.After several tests and cruising across multiple nations, he eventually found Sean O'Connell played by Sean Penn who was worth the wait even though the character wasn't a very prominent role yet, he was quintessential to the film. He elaborated the model "Life Magazine" was known, going to desolate and hazardous locations and live dangerously to explore the unknowns. His role captured the essence of the film of how Mitty envisioned life he would daydreamed of.Though the plot is seemingly plain and deprived of sparkling moments in the film, production designer Jeff Mann has managed to capture the spectacular visual elements of the boundless terrain in Iceland, Greenland and the Himalayas. Some may argue that the film's meandering pace is beyond mainstream audiences' capability to captivate. Yet, audience has the aptitude to tune in and anticipate the ecstasy and surreal world Ben Stiller depicted. The film has its reward for the deprivation of dialogue in some sense as complementing the extraordinary scenery which is beyond words to capture.Overall, in spite of the lack of thrilling moments in the film, the film is revitalizing to watch as an embankment of a new year. "Life is about courage and going into the unknown." Encapsulated the notion of the film and bursting out all the positive energy in you while you watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Home Run, But Enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty tells the tale of Walter, a lonely, unadventurous negative asset manager at LIFE magazine who daydreams constantly, but when a photo negative goes missing, Walter embarks on a real-life adventure to track it down. The film is directed by and stars Ben Stiller, who for the most part manages to forego his traditional comedy trappings making a film that is offbeat, visually sumptuous, and different than just about anything else out there on the market, however that doesn't hold true for the entire film. Walter Mitty often dips into over-the-top comedy in the daydreams, and it's here that Ben Stiller kind of falls back into his old schtick. The thing is, this comedy is often humorous, but the daydreams don't always tie into the story or what is thematically going on at that point in the film. Overall, there are many great ideas involving characters, theme, and story beats, but they often aren't fleshed out enough. Too many things seem to happen merely by coincidence because the script said so and not because they felt organic to the story or the characters. In summation, I think that this film was a few rewrites away from being a truly great film. As it is, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is just an okay film, albeit one that will occasionally entertain and make you smile.I give The Secret Life of Walter Mitty a 7 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't ever call this "the next Forest Gump", as I have previously seen it put. This being said I did very much enjoy this film!At points I believed it to be flawed and unrealistic as well as feeling at points they should have shown a bit more about how certain situations played out.Even though I felt these things (mentioned above), I found this film very inspiring. Being young myself (18), I love the idea of travelling and having amazing adventures. This film has really inspired and made it clear to me, that if I don't fulfil these dreams then it would be a massive regret.This is truly a beautiful film and a very nice heart warming story. I would struggle to see how someone would not enjoy this film, unless all you care about is how realistic one situation is or how did he get "signal" up there.I'm giving this an eight out of ten. This is because I very much so enjoyed the film, however at points felt it to be inaccurate.Hope you enjoy/enjoyed this film!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty", starring Ben Stiller-The Watch, Mystery Men; Kristen Wiig-SNL-t.v., MacGruber; Adam Scott-Our Idiot Brother, Step Brothers; Shirley MacLaine-Valentine's Day, Cannonball Run 2 and Sean Penn-Gangster Squad, The Thin Red Line.This movie is based on the 1939 short story by James Thurber, about a man that leads a boring life. He gets through it by 'zoning out' or fantasizing that his life is much more interesting than it actually is. Ben, who also directs the film, plays Walter, a man that has an eHarmony account but no hits on it-his sponsor keeps calling to see if he has done anything interesting, so that he can put it on the site. Ben works in the photo development department at Life magazine and Sean plays his best photographer, that has just sent in his latest collection of photos. The only problem is that the best picture-according to Sean's attached message-is missing. Adam plays the bringer of bad news that Life magazine is going digital, and there will only be one more issue in print-using the recently acquired best picture from Sean-before the changeover to the computer age. After meeting a new office girl, Kristen, who encourages him to track down Sean and find the missing negative, Ben goes on a journey to Iceland, Greenland and Afghanistan- Sean does not have a cell phone and moves around a lot taking his photo masterpieces. Shirley plays Ben's mother. The 'zoning out' that Ben does is pretty good but it happens fewer times, as the movie continues-maybe because he is actually experiencing life and does not need to fantasize anymore. It's rated "PG" for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 54 minutes. I don't think I would buy it on DVD but it would be alright, as a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May not be the best but certainly is one of the most beautiful films of the last year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Mitty is the fictional character from the short story by James Thurber. It was first published in "The New Yorker" in 1939. Although the movie differs completely from the original story, one thing, the main character, remains relevant at all times. Walter Mitty is a person who spends more time in heroic daydreams than pays attention to the real world. In movie this is called "zoning out" and is characterized by the blank stares of the main character. Movie has increasing pace, constantly changing situations and people which both become more and more fancy and Mitty always deals with them in simple open-hearted dedicated manner. In these aspects this movie is very much alike "Forrest Gump" or Tim Burton's "Big Fish". In fact, this movie even equals them. In movie Walter Mitty works at "Life" magazine with photography negatives. His life seems to be so simple that even the suite he wears is gray. Walter has strong affections towards co-worker Cheryl Melhoff (played by Kristen Wiig) but is too shy to talk about his feelings. His everyday dull life also includes being bullied by human resources manager Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott). Everything begins to change in Walters life from inside out when it turns out that the "Life" will be publishing the last paper issue of the magazine and he receives photo negatives intended for the cover. It turns out that the important for everyone cover photo is missing. Encouraged by his muse Cheryl Melhoff he embarks on the journey of the lifetime. Soon main characters real life begins to surpass the imagined one and he "zones out" less and less often. Script is great and has no flows. There are completely no excess things as they usually reaper latter on in the movie having meaning and giving acceleration to the plot. Dialogues are well thought out. Acting is convincing and the cast is picked well. Most of the movie time, however, belongs to Ben Stiller and all other characters have only secondary importance. Mysterious maverick and adventure hunter Sean O'Connell played by Sean Penn and Cheryl Melhoff character are the source of inspiration for Mitty and have short but effective both in timing and impact appearances. Worth of mentioning is also the annoying bearded boss Ted Hendricks who brings in mixed elements of comedy and injustice towards main character. Exceptionally well performances give all actors who play natives of Greenland, Iceland and Himalayas. Less talked about they seem to living in the scenes. Stiller as a director remains true to his comedian style and enriches this drama with comedy elements. This makes the movie easier to watch. The most exceptional aspect of the film is its cinematography. Landscapes, lightning in the scenes, takes and the storyboard are nearly perfect. Some exceptional scenes like football match in Himalayas are unforgettable. This movie certainly deserves Academy Award in the category of Cinematography. In addition to this, music and sound editing add warmth and comfort to overall experience of being in the search of adventure. In summary, this relaxing and heart-warming film leaves the feel that it is not about people but for the people. It has several many times heard before but rarely showed so breathtakingly important messages. Human imagination is a powerful tool which should not be quenched in everyday life as it determines not only how you feel but what you may tend to do in the future, joy in life lies in small things which we rarely see and etc. The secret 25th frame of Sean O'Connell film tells that the purpose of life may be the search in the meaning of life itself and that those who dare to seek it would feel very essence of living. The movie has the feel of freedom and relaxes audience. The best and the deepest work of Ben Stiller. Also, underrated which makes it a personal pleasant discovery for the viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the Danny Kaye movie when I was a kid. It was kind of corny and wasn't the most memorable.

I would recommend it to anyone. I think I've seen one Ben Stiller movie a very long time ago. He was the perfect Walter Mitty. Totally believable. Beautifully filmed and it was fun. Was never bored. Nice family movie.I just found out from a friend that the professional reviewers panned it which was surprising. So much for taste. I guess they like the deep dark movies, brooding actors, complicated dialog, remakes/sequels, and loud special effects more. This movie didn't have much of that which was fine by me. Anyway, I would recommend it to anyone. Well done Ben and Kristen!! Look forward to your next movie together. Thanks for giving us two hours of fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every once in a while a movie gives me a real feeling of well being. I leave the theater feeling stronger, calmer, happier, more in tune with life. The sunshine seems a little brighter. Annoying people don't annoy me. I feel like I could maybe conquer dragons--little ones. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was one of these movies and I'm not entirely sure why. On the surface it's a fairly simple, predictable, slightly over-the-top, feel good, made-for-TV type movie. But for several brief moments here and there I thought of all of those people who live decent, competent, unremarkable lives and must at some point look back and wonder what they have accomplished. Perhaps they have unknowingly made the lives of a number of their fellow human beings better--which is no small task in itself. For the few of those who have not only done that but managed to rise above their hum-drum existence for a brief and shining moment as well--hurray for you!!!The cinematography was wonderful. The scenes in Iceland and Greenland and the Himalayas were cool and amazing. The music was inspiring (the music didn't just enhance the movie--the movie seemed to enhanced the music). I have never been a big fan of Ben Stiller or Sean Penn, but after this movie I am finally pleased with both. Good job guys. If it tells you anything--some people sat thru the credits to the end. When is the last time that happened in a movie you saw?Not a perfect movie. Drags a little bit here and there. Maybe a little too ridiculous at times. Maybe a little too sappy here and there. But in the end it's what dreams are all about aren't they--getting a little bit more than we expected-- and maybe sometimes, getting it all?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had very little (to no) expectations for this film based on the trailer I saw. I expected with a leading cast like Steve Carell and Kristin Wig this would be something light hearted and funny to take in. That being said, I was so pleasantly surprised by what I experienced. It was such a moving, emotional story about life. It struck all the right chords with me. The evolution of Stiller's character through the film was somewhat breathtaking to watch. I left the theatre feeling so bright and inspired by the film. That is the kind of thing one wants to experience when going to the movies. It had been a long time since I had experienced something like that.This movie was beautifully shot, well acted, and has an absolutely superb soundtrack (supplied mostly by Jose Gonsalez, solo and his band Junip) that just heightened the moments of beauty in the film perfectly. This film is a definite must see in my books.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Certainly Stiller's best ever. Fans who came to see comedy obviously didn't read/view descriptions of the film before coming to see it. Yes, there is comedy, but it is subtle. The main thrust of the film is the desire to look beyond, to push your limits, to live your life and not the one others expect of you. Walter has lived a life of expectations and duty, a respectful life of supporting his mother and sister. The re-awakening of his inner self connecting to the real world and leaving the realm of the fantasy was invigorating. Beautiful graphics with deep and poignant meaning. This is a film that will stay with me for a long time.</fullReview>

This movie is a rare exception, it is very well written. There are some goofs which unrealistically put you away from a real life traveling experience, and I wish they would correct that. Also, there is too much exposure of eharmony and life magazine, we do not come to movies to watch corporate ads. However, overall, this movie rocks!

		<fullReview>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a bit embarrassing one. It's great from visual POV, camera work is great, touch of CGI is relevant and added with a manner. However there's a simple plot problem ? it's inconsistent and separated. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty looks like a group of several separated stories and clips with only one obvious connection between - Walter Mitty and various foggy ideas behind. Yes, there're a lot of great moments in those scenes and some of them can be rated from good to excellent but we aren't talking about them like various episodes from Walter Mitty series. It's not a series or one super-long trailer. Movie pretends to be an enlightening show for some reason so it'd be great to put one big idea there. There're a lot of hints to many ideas but all those hints are hardly visible behind various scenes and confusing reveals.I definitely expected much more from this one but movie eventually failed to be holistic. Movie feels like questionable book of many chapters "how to improve your life" than a one big movie. I definitely didn't want to buy that book.It's worth to watch on a screen anyway because visual part is stunning. Mr. Stiller made a good job so let's support his efforts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"God, you're noteworthy!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that the later half of 2013 has proved those (including myself) wrong about 2013 being a bad year for films. I'm not saying that this is the best of 2013, just that it's not as bad as I thought this years movies would be. When I started watching this, I wasn't in the best of moods. Which can be seen as a problem, because this is what's branded as a 'feel good film'. We'd got to the cinema late, in the hope that ads would run for around 20 minutes before the film, as they always do. This time, they did not. We didn't miss a lot, probably just the first 3 minutes. However, finally settling in wasn't made easy by my mother frequently tapping me and stating, "that Ben Siller's quite small, isn't he?" (That's not a typo, by the way, she still thinks his surname is 'Siller'). Anyway, this movie is not bad. Stiller really seems to know what he's doing, and I think this is a brave move for him, as he's usually typecast as a comedy actor. With this film, he's demonstrated that he understands how to use the camera to represent peoples everyday daydreams. Everyone does it, which makes Walter instantly relatable (to some degree). The feeling of escapism is brought across quite well, with clear contrasts to his mundane work life to his wild daydreams and eventual traveling. The acting is also noteworthy. The problem is, however, I feel that a film like this had a lot of potential for brilliant performances, which it didn't quite fulfill. They weren't bad per s?, but they didn't stand out like they could have. Slightly predictable, in a sense. Wiig's character is likable, but that's pretty much it. You see her as a love interest, and a kind of asset to him, but she's not enough to make you feel involved. I don't think that's because she can't do it, rather I think that she wasn't in it enough. She's a great actress, but she was mainly in this just for Mitty to daydream and awkwardly stare at. Stiller gives his signature acting style, however more played down, as this isn't a comedy. This style fits the character, for sure, but it could have been more alive. His Mexican friend and the Parks and Rec guy were pretty good as well, but it just seems too centered around Mitty. Character development was an issue, but that could possibly be because there was a baby sitting behind me making rather interesting chewing noises (though, to be fair, I must say it's parents kept it quiet quite well). There some decent laughs in this, too. Not like, "HAHAHA oh boy I can't breathe! Really! Call the cinema doctor!" But like, "Aha. Ah. Man, I need the toilet. But I'd rather see how far this joke goes before I go". The daydream sequences are comical, because although they are cleverly done, they are so out of the ordinary and enjoyable. It's not just the daydreams that were directed with care, though. My favourite scene is one that takes place through an x-day scanner. You seen everything happen through this screen, which is simply effective and comical. There is a scene that parodies a certain movie from a couple of years back. Now, when I heard that, I was instantly interested and couldn't wait to see what it was. Alas, when it got to it, it just didn't make sense. It didn't fit in, and was just there for an extra laugh, which it didn't need. A feel good soul searching film that was good, but had a lot of potential that it didn't fulfill, mainly due to the acting and oddly placed comedic scenes. Yeah, that's probably the best way I can put it. It's worth a watch, and it's not on the level of 'Walking with Dinosaurs', but we've seen better films this end of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For the Adventurer in All of Us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller has shown himself to be one of the hardest working and most dedicated actor-directors in today's cinema. He again proves himself here with his latest directed film, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.Stiller stars as the title character. Right away, we see who Walter is as a person. Stiller shows us what Walter's life is like as he is somebody who is conscientious with his money spending, cares about his mother, and lives a lonely life. Walter has begun to set up an account with eHarmony, but cannot come up with anything creative to put in it. But he continues to look at the profile of one Cheryl Melhoff (Kristen Wiig). He tries to send her a wink on the site, but it doesn't work. Walter then enlists the help of an eHarmony employee named Todd (Patton Oswalt), but still can't provide him with much information. At the same time, Walter has a habit of zoning out at various times during his day and ends up missing out on a lot, as he is one who can use lessons from Ferris Bueller.We then see Walter show up for work at Life magazine, where he looks at the negatives for photos. When he arrives to work at the beginning of the film, he finds out that the current issue will be the last one publish and Walter has to look at the latest negatives sent in by photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn). Walter gets a message from Sean saying that negative #25 of the bunch is the best of the set and thinks that one should be the final cover. Trouble brews when Walter looks at the negative and notices 25 is gone. This prompts Walter to go out into the world more and look for clues to find Sean and retrieve the missing negative.Ben Stiller's previous two directorial efforts, Zoolander and Tropic Thunder, were both entertaining with a lot of slapstick humor. With The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, Stiller as a director toned down the slapstick, but still has plenty of humor in the film and does a nice job of putting heart into the story. Stiller also makes some great choices in making us know when Walter is zoning out and making us interested in figuring out the clues too. I also highly enjoyed how Stiller put in the message of going out there, living life, and showing what can be accomplished. Stiller has made a film here for the adventurer in all of us.Stiller even does an excellent job of carrying this film on his shoulders as the lead actor. Stiller is great at making us like Walter and want him to succeed on his quest. The strongest part of Stiller's performance is that he makes Walter an ordinary guy who we can relate to. The entire ensemble does their part too. Kristen Wiig plays Cheryl, Walter's love interest. Wiig does a nice job of being Walter's motivation to go out there and do what he would not think about doing. Adam Scott plays Ted, Walter's new boss. Scott has shown before his capability of playing jerks like he did in Step Brothers, and brings that same kind of nastiness to his character here. Patton Oswalt is hilarious in his cameo as Todd, the eHarmony employee. Kathryn Hahn has a brief part as Walter's sister. Shirley MacLaine was also fun to see appear here as Walter's mother who gives him even more motivation and support. Sean Penn was the best of the supporting cast as the famed photographer Sean O'Connell. Penn has a great scene with Walter with a great monologue.Steve Conrad wrote the screenplay based off of the short story and does a nice job of making the blueprints to this story about an ordinary man who does some amazing things. The cinematography by Stuart Dryburgh is very breathtaking. His capturing of the scenery made we want to go out there and see it for myself in person. There is also some inspiring music by longtime Ben Stiller collaborator Theodore Shapiro.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stiller's Big Holiday Present to Us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the moment the previews showed up a few months ago, I knew we had a special film, and the whole feeling was reinforced when very little changed in the trailers as the movie's debut was around the corner. There was a feeling of expectation and exhilaration by the visual glimpses about Mitty's quest. He was looking for a dream, and we wanted to go along for the ride.The story is a complete delight, with a conclusion that will have your spirit soaring. Walter Mitty literally dreams all the time, spacing out during crucial moments, as if he's avoiding facing reality. What becomes apparent from the beginning is that he's one of us, and that he wins us over right away, as he at a crucial moment in his professional and emotional life. He needs to complete a very important task at work, employment which he might lose at any time, and since deadlines are tight, he must also confront two key decisions as soon as possible.He's had a special and professional relationship with a star photographer, who apparently thinks highly of Mitty, and things becoming complicated, forcing Mitty to travel all over the world to find the photographer and a very special photograph/negative. Walter Mitty soon finds himself in a world very different from what he has experienced so far. He grows in many ways, lets himself live every moment, and through Stiller's inspired camera-work, we experience every amazing moment with him. We are able to see and feel the wonder of being in such remote locations as Greensland, Iceland, the Himalayas, and everywhere he goes. There is comedy here, but it is of a very special kind. It is funny because it lightens and empowers the soul. Watching him show his skater tricks, the thrill of a bicycle race, climbing a mountain, swimming with sharks. It has been done before, but we somehow feel like we are part of the wonder.There are all these epic moments, as we see Walter discover so much more in the world, and it is the quiet moments that take over as the movie reaches its amazing conclusion. His eventual meeting with Penn, and the last ten minutes of the moment are powerful in ways we have seen in previous classics like "It's a Wonderful Life", "E.T.", and some of those movies that make you feel the wonder in life. In a world of digital "wonders", we see a movie that tells you that there is nothing if there is no connection to the heart or the soul or whatever makes us special. When Mitty finally sees what the special photograph is, it'll be challenging to not to feel something jump inside your chest and you experience tears of joy because of the powerful moment."Mitty" deserves recognition and admiration for it is a good film, with a solid set of performances, an inspiring and refreshing story, much more cinematic than anything this year. It doesn't need foul language to make us laugh, or idiocy of any time to appeal to all of us. It certainly boasts some of the most amazing cinematography of the year, and it has arguably the biggest heart in anything released this year.Five out of five hearts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a wonderful, inspiring fantasy drama comedy adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a visually beautiful, wonderful fantasy drama comedy film that comes with a simple but essential life message that's both inspiring and make you feel good at the same time. This film is essentially about a boring, hardworking, single and lonely, middle-class daydreamer with an active imagination, who frequently 'zoned out' to undergo fantastic adventures in his mind.In this film, Stiller allows the character he portrays to shine, showing the gradual change in his character throughout the film without a differing core personality. Although the starting of the film suffers a few minor 'hiccups' due to a few abrupt, over-the-top fantasy dream adventures, the film starts to improve as Walter embarks on a life- altering adventure that manages to inspire and affect the audience without the feeling of being pretentious.Not sure why most of the professional critics dislike it so much, some even mentioning that his fantasy adventures are greater than his actual trip he embarked in the second half of the film. Although his fantasies are greatly exaggerated by the usage of modern CGI, his actual journey were nothing short of impressive as not many of us would be lucky enough to encounter such events in our travels.Perhaps the critics don't realise how hard it is to survive from a great white and very cold sea waters, cycle around the roads of Iceland, to witness the beautiful landscapes of Iceland, to daringly skateboard your way to a town, to barely escape from a volcano eruption, to encounter and barter with the warlords in ungoverned Afghanistan, to hike the mountains of Himalayas or even damn lucky enough to see a snow leopard in the wild (Snow leopards are very shy, elusive cats known for their solitary nature, are rarely seen in the wild.Total estimated population could be 4000-7000).The film also reminds us of the current problem of our generation, the obsession of taking great photographs. Yes, photographs are important. It lets us reminisce the good old memories of the past. But, don't forget to live the moment as well as they're precious and brief.Very highly recommended. This is a fun film with a whole-hearted simple story. Try to put your cynicism aside and just enjoy it, let Walter 'take' you into his fantastical journey. You'll not be disappointed.Rating: 8.5/10"Don't work too hard in life, live it. Don't just dream too much about doing something, do it. Don't just obsessing over taking photos for every great moment in your life, learn to live these precious moments as well.""Life is about courage and going into the unknown""To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind wall, draw closer, to find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life."http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/12/movie-review-secret-of-walter- mitty.html</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Visual aspect of Walter Mitty is excellent, but something was lacking. The previews held the film to a high standard therefore causing a raised level of expectation. It did not meet my expectations. I give Stiller props for taking on a film that's been in development hell since 94' and causing such a beautiful outcome. The soundtrack and editing style were also bothersome. I felt as though more epic and majestic music was necessary for certain scenes and would have served the film a great deal. Certain cuts were an issue for me as well, they felt uncomfortable. Though the film felt crammed into two hours , the locations, actors, and visual wit was overall superb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember reading James Thurber's story when I was a freshman in high school. I have to admit that Ben Stiller takes this beloved literary classic and gives it an amazing new twist. Stiller is an excellent choice to play Mitty. I have long been an admirer of his and I feel that he is like a modern day Jimmy Stewart. He has a wonderful, down to earth "everyman" quality that all of us can identify with. In his movies he is always the lovable underdog who seems so insignificant and yet in the end is the hero. All of us who have slipped on a banana peel and embarresed ourselves can identify with this wonderful thespian. What is remarkable is that as a director Stiller only gives a nod to Mitty's heroic fantasies, they flash very briefly. He dreams of saving a building full of people from a gas explosion and beating up his pain in the ass boss (who HASN'T daydreamed of that). However, in his effort to save his job and find a missing frame of film, Mitty turns real life adventurer (in the beginning he couldn't think of one "remarkable" thing he ever did in his life) We see him skateboarding through a volcanic explosion, surviving a plunge into a shark infested ocean and climbing the highest mountain in the most freezing cold. I love movies that try to be original and Stiller certainly dares to do that and it pays off wonderfully I just kept wondering what in the hell was on that Frame 25. Stiller's transformation from Marvin Milquetoast to Indiana Jones may not be the least bit convincing, or even make very little sense, but what the hell! Your entertaining us Mister Stiller and that's all that matters. Kristin Wiig, a wonderful comic actress and Saturday Night Live cast member, is really sweet as Mitty's fantasy love interest. SPOILER ALERT, after Mitty saves the day in the end and has the last word on the boss he hated, it shows he and Wiig together at last. I had that sense of disappointment I had in the end of Sleepless in Seattle, because I wanted to know if there was a happy end for both of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a wonderful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie we love....very unusual and an interesting story, great photography, great screenplay, great music, great cast. So many movies these days are so violent or graphic, and with terrible language. This movie was so much fun to watch, and, for a change, we left the theater smiling and happy, instead of disturbed and depressed!Ben Stiller was excellent in the title role. As he goes into his "zones", imagining things as he wished they would be, one is transported to exotic locales and wonderful characters. The transitions from imagination to reality are seamless. Shirley MacLaine has a fairly small part, but is her always wonderful self in her role as Walter's mother. We waited so long to go see this that we almost missed it at our theater. This is one to see on the big screen and with an audience. Our audience was of all ages, young to old, and everyone seemed to like it. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Spoilers ~ Heart-Warming, Fun &amp; Thought-Provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all candor, Ben Stiller's success at the box office has not been attributed to any financial contribution from our family. Possibly, you can find him near the bottom of those actors/directors that draw us to the movie house. That being said, a couple of friends insisted that I watch this film and they are generally right when knowing what films will tickle my acutely narrow funny bone, and they were right on.This movie is well written, acted, and directed all of which led to a thoroughly enjoyable experience. There is no "secret" as to the message of this film, but the fine way in which the story draws you into a very common and "human" condition of living, albeit, somewhat to the extreme, is fun and poignant at times. I found as I watched this movie, that I reflected on my own life choices. I believe this is where the magic in this films resides, as it has the potential to touch the audience in a way that naturally lends itself to self-reflection, but more powerful than that, perhaps transformation.I've attempted to remain somewhat vague in my review for those who don't enjoy knowing everything about a movie/story before the watch it, but I hope that anyone that is not a Ben Stiller fan, and those that are, to expected something unexpected and outside his typical genre.This is my first review, so please don't judge too harshly. I do hope you enjoy this film as much as I did.</fullReview>

Its CLEAN ENTERTAINMENT (no censorship required) and I think the audience can easily connect to it.Its got a little of everything in almost absolute proportion supported by the great performance and scintillating shooting locations.I would say, maybe they didn't promote the movie well.

		<shortDescription>Has good aspects but generally doesn't seem to know what it wants to do and is only consistent in one aspect ? its unevenness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not overly familiar with the source material but the name Walter Mitty does tend to mean something even to those that haven't read the story ? and accordingly it is of a daydreamer, a man lost in his own thoughts and being ineffective. This film version of it using this as the starting point and from here we see our main character forced to overcome his inertia and take action and thus having the type of adventures that he would only experience by spacing out for a while. I remember seeing the trailer for this recently and both me and my partner came away with the same impression ? we had no idea what this film was but for sure the trailer didn't make it look good at all. Sometimes this can be the case with difficult films though ? because if the film isn't one clear thing, then perhaps marketing struggle to sell it and you end up with trailers that either present it as something it isn't, or just don't sell anything. As a result I decided to see it for myself.The answer is clear before you are too far into the film; the trailer doesn't know what to sell because the film doesn't know what it is. By turns it is a simple message to "seize the day" to the target age audience of workers seeing their youth fade; but then it is also a travelogue of beautiful scenery in beautiful places; but then it is also a special effects film with big sequences of superhero fights and explosions; but then it is also much more introspective and character- focused; but then it is also a comedy with goofy slapstick and movie spoofs. All of this is in there in many different ways and almost none of it works when you put it next to another aspect ? which is a problem in a self-contained 2 hour film. By the end the film felt so aimless and meandering that I wasn't sure why I should care Perhaps some people will be moved by the "just do it" message, or the "all ended well then" conclusion but these were so simplistic and unmatched with so much else that I really was left cold.Bits of it work in isolation and I did enjoy some aspects of the film, but the whole thing is uneven and seems to be lacking in consistency in its tone and its aims (if it even has any). I am all for films that can pull off a complex mix of ideas, emotion at different levels, tones, but this is not a film that pulls it off ? this is just a film where a lot of things tend to exist very close to one another. The script seems to be the problem but I am not convinced that Ben Stiller knows what he is making here. His direction seems directionless outside of getting some great shots. This is even more evident in his acting; he delivers a performance that is whimsical and introspective but he does it in the middle of a film with nothing there to support that performance. Wiig is actually pretty good in a simple role, because she is pretty and likable without being so unreal as to become part of Mitty's fantasy herself. The rest of the cast are solid enough but again everyone is just acting out their scene in isolation.Maybe there is a beautiful, moving story in Conrad's script; it is impossible to tell here. The film will give you some laughs, it will give you some nice moments, it will give you some beautiful landscapes and it will give you some spectacle but it will not do anything consistently and this is what ultimately sunk the film for me. For once the movie trailer was accurate and honest in its reflection of the movie, because the film doesn't know what it is, and it doesn't work.</fullReview>

Ben Stiller portrays the title character really well and it is one of his best movies. This movie, as stated in the summary is VERY relatable. In fact I don't see how anyone could not compare it to his or her life, which will disappoint some people who are looking to escape from reality.

		<fullReview>This is quite easily one of the most enjoyable movies of the year. I've been a big fan of the old Danny Kaye "Mitty" since a high school teacher showed it to our class during a free day in high school about 12 years ago. This is not a remake. This is a re-imagining. And it works. The movie is not boring or awkward as the critics have said. WALTER is boring and awkward- until he finds that spark adventurousness inside himself and stops living in his safe little dream world and starts living in the real world. The cast is fantastic. The chemistry is phenomenal. I've always been a fan of Ben Stiller, and it is great to see Patton Oswalt on the big screen. Do yourself a favor and give this movie a shot. I promise you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a unique film that will both entertain and inspire you. The story centres on Walter Mitty. Many were considered for the role such as Will Ferrell, Jim Carrey, Owen Wilson, Mike Myers and Sacha Baron Cohen but in the end Ben Stiller both stars and directs. He does a wonderful job bringing the down trodden Walter Mitty to life. The film focuses on Walter who stores negatives for the fictional Life Magazine. Walter is unhappy with how his life has turned out but lacks the courage to go after what he needs. Instead he turns to a world of daydreams which proves to be unsatisfying. What happens next is both wonderful and inspiring. I loved this film. Ben Stiller is believable and fun. Sean Penn is his usual charismatic self and adds some spice to the film. The story is unique and captivating. It is a great way to spend the afternoon and you can bring the kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It will take your breath away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason I even considered seeing a film with a title that begins "The Secret Life of..." is because Ben Stiller is in it, and though he has most certainly partaken in a few bloopers he remains one of my favorite actors of our time. I figured that if the movie turned out to be a farce, I would at least have discovered a film with Ben Stiller in that I Didn't enjoy which would be a new cinematic experience for me.Now if you read just a few reviews of this movie you're going to hear the word "scenery" mentioned a lot. Let me just clarify by "scenery" I don't mean "rolling hills of green and glistening dew drops on the golden screen" - I.E monotonous visual CODSWALLOP that one may use to describe films like Lord of the Rings or The Sound of Music. I mean "scenery" in the sense of PREPARE TO HAVE A REVOLUTION IN SENSORY PERCEPTION.You are not buying a ticket to a comedy, or a drama, or by any means a movie that is any way realistic in a reasonable sense of the word. Bear that in mind.Also bear in mind the bigger the TV you can watch this on the better.Consequently this is one of the only movies that I would recommend actually paying to see in the movies. OR, if you are really cheap, wait until it becomes available on DVD, find someone with a really big TV, befriend them just long enough to watch it, and then tell them how much you actually hate them, and leave, taking your DVD with you.</fullReview>

But what I really want to say is that this movie is a great one: full of poetry, witty moments, fantastic landscapes, a nice soundtrack and an excellent Ben Stiller (and Sean Penn is always good). It is one of those movies that gives you something that will remain once you leave the cinema. The message is 'live with intensity, without being always scared, expecting things will fix themselves'. A very simple meaning, I know, but in this movie it was rendered very well without being cheesy or trying too hard. To me one of the best movies of 2013, no doubts about this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie the other day in the cinema, and I have to say it is an absolute gem. It is excellent. In fact, I could even go as far to say it is near perfection. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a light, uplifting story of a shy, middle-aged man finding his inner courage in the areas of work and social life. He is portrayed by Ben Stiller and in my opinion is perfect for the part. Stiller gives us the audience a pleasant feel for him as a regular going bloke who is a bit socially awkward. During the coarse of the movie he juggles the tasks of getting the attention of a fellow work employee Cheryl Melhoff(Kristen Wiig,)who he is slowly falling in love with, at the same time of which he is bullied around by a new Executive worker Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott), sent in to help round up with the last edition of life (the Magazine Mitty works for). Mitty is given the heavy responsibility of delivering the photo which is to be used for the final installment of Life Magazine before it transfers online. Which of coarse is missing, setting him on his journey to over seas to track down the photographer who took the picture. This forces him to make important decisions slowly revealing the new man he has become. The Directing of the play is immaculate. I can't fault it. It's quite hard to explain, but your'e just going to have to trust me on this one.However I do have one minor-major nit pick. When he is in Iceland, Mitty is traveling to a Volcano, which erupts when he is less than a mile away from the foot of the mountain. Shortly after, it shows Mitty fleeing from a Pyroclastic Flow in the car of a man who offered to save him from sure death. Now, Pyroclastic Flows travel at speeds up to 750 kph and can reach temperatures of 1000 degrees centigrade, incinerating everything in its path. However, it clearly shows Mitty and his "rescuer" engulfed by the flow which should have killed them instantly, but instead are seen returning to a Papa Jones, unharmed, with a mere dusty car.Apart from the scene I just described, there is nothing wrong with this Movie. It will go down as one of my all time favourites, thank you for reading this review(it's my first) and i hope you enjoy this movie just as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walter Mitty is all about crossing the boundaries of your imagination and turning it into reality.It tells the story of a guy that day dreams a lot, involves a women with whom he is fond of but too shy to ask her out, and deals with unemployment paradigm.I confess that initially I was wondering if it would be a silly empty meaning comedy, but soon realized it was not.It is a story about true values, involving honesty, integrity and true love, and I recommend anyone that has any dreams whatsoever to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walter Mitty's Life should be no Secret - Noodles Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the movie I wanted to love the most this year. From the first trailer I saw of it so long ago, I was greatly looking forward to it. I really didn't know what to expect from it; you really don't know what the story's gonna be about until you actually see the movie. That kind of ambiguity really intrigued me. What also intrigued me was that it looked as if Ben Stiller was veering away from strictly comedy into a more serious role in this movie. It almost reminded me of Jim Carrey when he went and did Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. And while Carrey was much better in that movie than Stiller is in this one, I think I enjoyed Walter Mitty's adventure more. So, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is about a guy who kind of lives a boring lifestyle, which leads him to be ultimately the biggest daydreamer in the world. He literally freezes and imagines some spectacular things going on, usually including him as a hero. And we get to see everything he imagines and how people perceive him when he zones out, all from Walter's perspective. From the trailers, these dreamlike sequences seemed really cool and I thought they'd be an awesome highlight. However, in the film, sometimes they're a bit drawn out. They do result in some cool or funny moments though. One of these is even so outrageous that some people may not like it. But it was just so ridiculous that I was laughing so hard; you'll know what I'm talking about if you see it, because it involves conversation of another film that came out in 2008. Anyway, Walter Mitty works for Life magazine as a negative asset processor. He gets all the negative slips of film and process them so they can be photos in the magazine. And this time the one photo that they have to use for the cover is missing, so Walter decides to track down the photographer so he can get ahold of the picture. From there, his real adventure starts and this movie greatly picks up. He starts to go into his fantasies a lot less since his actual life is becoming so lively and epic. This is testament to the directing of the film, which is done by Ben Stiller himself. I was really amazed with so many shots in this movie. The cinematography sometimes has such a large and epic scale, and then other times it has a really interesting and visually artful take. Some scenes really even gave me goosebumps because I really felt so sucked in and moved by some of the shots and sequences in this film. His acting isn't bad either because he plays a convincing Walter Mitty. He's hardworking and determined but also a bit quirky and awkward. Kristen Wiig's character, Walter's love interest, was also played well; I think this is the best she's ever been since it's the first time she wasn't playing an outrageously absurd character, and instead a desirable and somehow inspiring woman. The strongest role in the movie, however, is the small amount of time that Sean Penn is on screen. He plays the photographer that Walter is tracking down, and he's really in this character; he's so interesting and laid back, really encapsulating the presence of a photographer. Then, of course, there's the downsides. There are a few corny characters in this movie. Adam Scott, whom I know as the jerk older brother from Step-Brothers, plays an incredibly cartoony character in this movie. It's made in such a way that he's such an unrealistically mean a$$hole. I understand that he's supposed to be an antagonist but he really didn't fit. As with a couple other characters, like Walter's weird sister or Adam Scott's bearded friends who just act like henchmen. This sort of disrupted the tone of the film as well.A major gripe of this movie is its tonal inconsistency, since the tone was all over the place for the first third of this movie. It sort of got out of it. The daydreams, even, kind of come out of nowhere and most of the time don't have time to get you connected to them. Just as well, the movie has some very clichéd moments, and the movie overall has a lot of very predictable elements. As a result, the writing of the film isn't very strong. Even some comedic moments are hindered by this. But even so, the film does have a large share of funny scenes, whether they're subtle or laugh-out-loud. What I came to see this movie for wasn't the comedy, though; I came for an inspiring feel-good tale. And from the moment Walter makes his decision to go to Greenland, that's what we get. The location shooting is absolutely breathtaking and the transitions in this movie from scene to scene are even cool in their own way. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is probably the most visually stunning film of 2013 and the epic cinematography gives it such an ambitious feel. The real thing to this movie is Walter finding himself, and actually living life, and I can't tell you enough how satisfying that actually is to see. This movie polarizes critics and viewers as some can love it, some can hate it, and some can go straight in the middle. While I wasn't totally invested in the first act of the film due to tonal inconsistencies and some bad characters, once Walter Mitty embarks on his adventure, it becomes one of the most uplifting and awe- filled movies I've seen in a while. While it subtly disappointed me, it still impressed me</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet Another Ben Stiller Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched The secret life of Walter Mitty a mind blowing movie but it has it's own up and down's but still worth breaking our necks cause we're the only peoples sitting in the front row of a movie theater. When i saw the first trailer of the film i have then decided that i would watch this cause duhhh it's directed and stared Ben Stiller the king of comedy and adventure like the Topic Thunder which did both stared and direct. So in to the film it was amazing and loved the concept of the film and give a hats off to Ben Stiller for the site he picked for the film it was beautiful i couldn't believe that Afghanistan would be really wonderful. And now for the casting part it was a great casting choice by Ben Stiller like Ben Stiller as Walter Mitty was perfect for him another hats off for perfectly enhancing the role of Walter Mitty, Sean Penn as Sean O' Connell was the best i know it was just a cameo but this was the best cameo of 2013 and he really was a good fit to the role, have guys even notice Shirley MacLaine as Edna Mitty was really a good job well done in this age thumps up for you, and last but not the least Adam Scott as Ted Hendricks is Walter Mitty's boss was great the role of Ted Hendricks is a mean boss who doesn't know his employees to much but Adam Scott has nailed the role now i kinda like him in the film but i don't want a boss like that never. Now the plot of the film was kinda mixed but after watching the whole film i really liked the plot but the concept of Walter Mitty is a normal guy who does not have much friends and love life but the best part is that when he imagine some random things that's possible but at the end he does them all And the down part of the film was casting Kristen Wiig as Cheryl Melhoff was no different at all cause in the film if you don't cast her it's no problem cause Ben Stiller stole the show and her acting was to low standard and don't want to see her again but still the film was wroth watching LOVED IT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie I seen of Ben Stiller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie trailer itself caught on to me on the very first seconds, and finally seen the movie I never imagined it would reach that benchmark. The picture, the story behind to it and most of all the one quote shown in the movie about the purpose of life will definitely reach the hearts of both young and old. This movie deserves an award when it comes to picture the pure crisp detail gone into the movie shows how much effort Ben Stiller put into the movie. The story put into the movie is very grasping and sometimes hilarious. The movie is not to be missed so be sure to check out the movie.I hope Ben Stiller or another great director makes movies like this with so much detail gone into it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a truly inspiring film that will have you leaving the theater in awe. The story and cinematography is no doubt Oscar worthy. Ben Stiller's character, Walter, is very charismatic and Stiller played him perfectly. Watching him grow throughout the film is probably the best part of the entire picture. The movie leaves you with that sense of satisfaction at the end that most movies seem to be lacking now a days. After watching this you're going to want to quit your day job and travel around the world. To certain people this movie might very well be life changing. I won't be one bit surprised when we see this win several rewards from the academy. A must see last minute 2013 film before the new year!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amazing Feel-Good Film about 'Life' and 'Adventure'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is one of those films that truly define what life is all about and who we are as people living in it! I have never seen its original 1947 adaptation nor did I hear of this story's existence, but after seeing this I can honestly say that its story gives a much more meaning to today's generation of people than what it did back then due to today's digital age.The story focus on its title character Walter Mitty (played by the always funny and delightful Ben Stiller), a negative assets manager at LIFE Magazine who seems to keep and maintain a quiet but sometimes dull life. But at times, he can frequently daydream about having a fantastic adventure where he is strong, brave and fearless and as well has crush on a co-worker named Cheryl (Kristen Wiig in her best performance much like Bridesmaids). As Walter receives his last submission of works from fellow photojournalist Sean O'Connell (a small role played great by Sean Penn) who has included a Negative 25 that Sean believes captures the "quintessence" of life and should be used for the cover of LIFE's last printed magazine due to the online transition taking place. However the Negative 25 appears to be missing when Walter examines the submission. Following this, Walter is then taken not only a mission but a journey that will bring a whole new meaning of life in Walter's world and take his fantasy adventures into reality as he embraces the ultimate adventure.The film delivers so many themes into its storyline, some being about Love, Adventure, Discovery of Life, Identity, Change and importantly as stated in the film the "quintessence" of life, meaning how anything we know or see is the perfect example of its type. These themes suit the story fine without holes occurring but is the delivery of these messages presented clear and forward. With Ben Stiller directing, starring and producing this film, I can honestly say he does give an excellent job (in fact, this is only his 2nd directing feature since Tropic Thunder). He manages to keep the film aimed towards to a family-friendly audience but it can be admired by any single person of any gender, age or race. Stiller as well gives such a funny, endearing yet symbolic performance as Walter as he goes though life as this one individual who follows what is right, and yet through his journey of discovery and identity he undergoes this transition of being 'out there' in the world, rather than imagining them as seen in his daydream scenes. The daydream sequences are all fun and epic in their own way, they provide their own feelings and theme that define Walter in his mind. Wiig as well is funny and endearing yet she beautifully fits perfect as her character Cheryl, who plays an important role on Walter's journey being love and inspiration. The supporting cast (including the talents of Adam Scott, Shirley MacLaine, Sean Penn, Kathryn Hahn and Patton Oswalt) all give great performances, making their character role fit nicely into the storyline.The cinematography, locations and visual effects are all taken to the level of excellent, helping to make the film believable to the audience. Locations used are New York, California, Iceland and Canada and they are used in ways to make the story location seem epic and beautiful. The locations seen during Walter's journey are a sight to behold despite being on the screen (it must have been an exciting experience for the cast and crew). Visual effects here help to make the story display great and realistic, playing a role in assisting in some of the film's big sequences such as Walter's daydreams and the epic volcano ash escape, these consist of 18 visual effects teams that pull these off easily.One of my major favourite features in the film is music; to me it plays such an important role throughout the story and makes the emotion of the characters and story seems believable. The musical talents of José González, Rouge Wave, Rouge Valley, Junip, Jack Johnson and composer Theodore Shapiro deserve not only Award nominations but a standing ovation for their works that define the journey of Walter Mitty and life itself. González's track 'Stay Alive' is one of the film's songs that will stay in your head long after the credits are gone, with its lyrics of love, life and survival inspiring the positive message of the story.Overall, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a film that may not be everyone's cup of tea but it does deserve to be an important film that cannot be missed. It will make you feel-good and positive about your own life and inspiring you to think and decide where you want to be in life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently went and saw this on Christmas with my girlfriend, and my parents. I was excited to see a film that was wholesome for the family, but also intriguing in many aspects. As you watch the movie, you find yourself cheering for Walter Mitty as he uncovers the true meaning of what "Life", both his own and the magazine company he works for, is all about. The Secret Life is moving and encourages the dreamer in every person to step out and do something. It shows that any ordinary person can make extraordinary journeys and do incredible things with their life. As I walked out of the theater with my family, we all commented on how it made us want to travel, to just go somewhere, because we can. It truly makes you feel as though no matter how mundane life may be, there is always adventure lurking in the distance, you just have to be willing to find it. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is an incredibly enjoyable film with some laughs in between that provides great joy and warmth to the heart. It may not be an award winner, but it makes an impact. Do yourself a favor, and treat yourself to indulging in the Secret Life of Walter Mitty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zoned Out at Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Sometimes the line between reality and fantasy is blurred. In the moment, daydreams can feel like real life. Such is the existence of Walter Mitty, the milquetoast main character of James Thurber's 1939 "New Yorker" short story. This is no remake of Danny Kaye's 1947 movie, and thank goodness for that ... no one wants to see Ben Stiller singing and dancing. Mr. Stiller not only takes on the role of the zoned out Mitty, but he also directs (quite effectively).Walter is a quiet, photo lab geek at Life Magazine, the long time publication that is closing its doors. Of course, in real life, those doors closed years ago, but the magazine name makes for the perfect contradiction to Mitty's existence. The transition team is in place led by the snide, bearded corporate presence of Adam Scott. Photographer extraordinaire Sean O'Connell (played by Sean Penn) has delivered the perfect shot for the final cover. Only one problem: Walter has misplaced it.This gaffe leads Walter to cross paths with a co-worker played by Kristen Wiig, whom he has secretly admired both across the office and by staring at her eHarmony profile online. Their investigative work leads Walter on the first real journey of his life. He even breaks free of the family bond of his mom (Shirley MacLaine) and sister (Kathryn Hahn) and gets a pep talk and well timed boost from Patton Oswalt.Walter's expedition leads him to Greenland, Iceland, the Himalayas, and Afghanistan by way of Yemen. He also encounters a wild helicopter pilot and ride, sharks, an erupting volcano, drinking beer from giant glass boots, a sad and aggressive Karoke singer, and takes a speedy ride via skateboard. Rather than changing Walter, these experiences just bring out a lust for life that was previously only flashed through his periods of fantasy zone outs.The acting is very strong in this one, and that comes from a guy who is not much of a Stiller fan. His beaten down demeanor and stone-faced expressions are spot on for the Mitty role. Ms. MacLaine, Ms. Hahn, Mr. Oswalt and Mr. Scott all add very nice comedic touches and Sean Penn captures the rugged fearlessness of a world weary photographer who recognizes the depth of Mitty.If you are a fan of Thurber's short story then you must know artistic license is taken to turn it in to full length feature. Screenwriter Steven Conrad provides Life magazine as a foundation, and some of the most beautiful places on earth during the journey. He even gives us a poetry falcon (my first) and a parody of Benjamin Button (a bit out of place). Cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh delivers these locations to us in stunning fashion. The film is beautiful to look, and thanks to the score from Theodore Shapiro, it's complimented by well fitting music.This is one of those crowd-pleasing movies filled with sentimentality and charm. Critics will bash it, but most of us can relate to the underdog lead and his delusions of grandeur. www.MovieReviewsFromTheDark.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quintessence. After watching this tonight, I can honestly say that it is definitely worth a watch. It is a modern depiction of the short story written by James Thurber. Although I haven't read the story you certainly can notice the differences ? in the advancements of technology - since 1939 when it was originally published.Ben Stiller director and protagonist does both perfectly, keeping you gripped throughout. There are characteristics of romance, comedy and mainly adventure. At times your thinking is he daydreaming, or not? Is life just one big daydream? You catch yourself sympathising with Mitty as the film seems to say something about modern society, about how technology is revolutionising today's society and the daydreams we have about LIFE.A must watch, just marvellous. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can not get this movie out of my head. It truly stays with you, for hours after the credits have rolled and you've returned home. It has been a while since a movie has done that for me and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty achieved this easily. Every aspect of this movie was immaculately done, from the characters to the acting to the cinematography to the music. Everything fit so well together, like pieces of a puzzle that only you were looking at. From the second the film began, I could tell that this was going to be a movie that would resonate. The music is extremely well-chosen and the score is perfect for each scene. Each song made me feel the emotions that Ben Stiller wanted me to feel; excellent music. The colors and the scenery of this film are impeccable. I can not get it out of my head. The scene where Ben Stiller longboards through Iceland may be the most beautiful scene I've witnessed in a movie to date. There's something about that scene, with no words, and the music...It's a beautiful scene. More than anything else that this movie does, it makes you feel something. Something more than "Well, that was a good film" or "What a beautiful movie." It was a feeling that there is really something more out there for everyone. The feeling that Walter Mitty is in all of us, especially in this day and age, where we're stuck more than ever. The feeling that we can do anything. And if a film can make you feel that, then what more could you want?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is triumphant, captivating, affirming, quirky, and original. With this film, Ben Stiller proves himself to be a director of vision and depth. Writer Steve Conrad also deserves accolades for his imaginative and uplifting screenplay. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013) reassures us that there is beauty within us all; that we have a magnificent world to explore; that there are many kind and compassionate humans to cross paths with; and that it IS possible to reclaim our dreams. The "Space Oddity" ("Major Tom") scene with Kristen Wiig is sheer perfection, one of my favorite cinematic moments of all time. This isn't to say that the movie is without flaws. Most of the characters are pretty one-dimensional, and the film takes a couple of "cute" risks that don't quite pan out. The whole eHarmony guy thing could have been done SO much better, and the great Shirley MacLaine is pretty much wasted here. That seems like a lot of flaws, but this movie's weaknesses are so far outshone by its strengths that the faults don't matter. As Walter might say, it is easy to suspend disbelief.See this movie. Bring a date. Bring your kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is a celebration of life. It's a feel good movie that not only inspires, but motivates its viewers to go out and live life to the fullest. Don't let anyone, especially yourself, stop you from seeking adventure and making the best of this precious gift of being alive. It is a fun and heartwarming tale that is worth watching. The story and screenplay don't necessarily excel or surprise in the narrative department, but they provide a emotionally satisfying experience nonetheless. However, this film really shines from a directorial stand point. Ben Stiller does an excellent job of balancing the fantasy and real world moments in the film. I really felt like I was watching a person's daydreams when Walter would zone out. It's exciting and beautifully executed and when the character snaps back into reality, it is very much like me when I daydream.The cast does a solid job, but nothing really stands out performance wise. Having said that, I find Walter to be an incredibly likable character. He's odd and a bit awkward, but he never feels hopeless so we can always root for him when things don't go as planned. And Ben Stiller's natural charisma adds to the character's likability. Overall "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is an enjoyable feel good movie that will warm your heart and make you appreciate life. The film doesn't excel in any one particular area of film making, but it does hit you were it counts. Accompanied by a great soundtrack/score, this is a movie that is worth watching and you'll come out of it with a new found appreciation for life. I give it 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ben Stiller And His Eyes Take Us On A Masterful Feel Good Journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never realized how blue Ben Stiller's eyes are. This was my first thought in the opening scene of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Indeed, Ben's clear, intensely blue eyes feature prominently throughout the film, and help give the character of Walter Mitty a poignant humanity, hooking the audience into his story. And what a story it is. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is based on a 1939 short story written by James Thurby and originally published in The New Yorker. It revolves around mild-mannered Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller), who works in the film department of Life magazine. Walter processes the amazing photos from around the world published in the magazine, but has never been adventurous enough to discover the world himself. The film opens on Walt's forty-second birthday and he looks decidedly middle-aged when we first see him. It comes as a bit of a shock to see Ben Stiller looking so old (he is forty-eight in real life), however it adds authenticity to the film. The theme of the film is mid-life crisis and for those currently journeying through Middle Life, it's a wonderful reminder that it's never too late to do those things you've always wanted to do. Sometimes we just need a push to get us started. The film's cinematography is exquisite, with a classic retro feel due to the Time magazine setting and prominent use of iconic Time covers as backdrops throughout. The adventure scenes are a lush contrast to the New York scenes, and the soundtrack is perfect. Ben Stiller not only starred in the film but also directed it, and kudos to him for a job extremely well done.Kristen Wigg does a reasonable job as Walt's love interest, although it's not her best performance. Adam Scott plays an Office-esque nasty boss with a beard that deserves it's own ending credit. The supporting cast of off-beat characters that Walt meets on his adventures are great, including the wonderful Sean Penn as the elusive Time photographer Sean O'Connell. The audience is rewarded for taking the journey with Walt by an immensely touching ending, one that you'll never forget. Just like Ben's startling blue eyes. Four and a half stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ben Stiller's surreal, dramatic turn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller is known for being a comic actor and an occasional director and with his latest film The Secret Life of Walter Mitty he takes more serious turn. Based on the short story of the same name about a man who daydreams Stiller gives us a very dreamlike looking world with his wide shots and bright, white colour pallet. Even the real life world had a surreal quality to it, particularly when Walter is travelling to find photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn).Stiller gives a strong performance and he works well with Kristen WIgg, Shirley MacLaine and Kathryn Hahn. Some of the daydreaming sequences were better then others, some being a bit too long. The best being a sweet moment when Walter's love interest comes back and sings 'Major Tom'.Unfortunately the ending for the film does drag on as the film attempts to be a life affirming experience.This is film that has an excellent soundtrack.3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why the public goes to movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll keep this short. This could have been a really cool movie which represented LIFE magazine in the right light. Instead, Ben Stiller starred in a commercial for EHarmony, Papa Johns, Cinnabun, and GreenLand's Convention and Visitor's Bureau. The movies used to be the one place where the public could avoid commercials and gorilla marketing. Now my greatest fear has arrived, I can't go anywhere without being marketed to. Thanks Stiller. Only Hollywood would figure out how to make money before anyone even buys a ticket......Now I'm writing to get to 10 lines so my post will be posted. What happen to the Dog Day Afternoons, True Romance with that scene between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken in the trailer....they didn't talk about how good a big mac was at Burger King (You'll get that joke near the end of this movie). I'm pass 10 lines now...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Secret Life?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie with zero expectations and came out of it feeling clueless. Its supposedly about a secret of of some regular Joe in a regular job, but aside from a few wacky dreams, I didn't much see any secret life. He's interested in a girl at work, but they lack any chemistry whatsoever. They only talk about this one photo that Mitty needs and it seems rather pointless. So he goes to Greenland, then Iceland, then back again, then to Afghanistan, then back again. Does anyone else wonder where he got all that money from? Yes there were a few cool sequences promoting Iceland or Greenland or wherever, but it felt largely redundant. It was pretty much a mission to get a stupid photo for a now defunct magazine. So about the secret life...? Umm?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a 'nice' film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the film, it works well as a 'feel good film', some of the scenery is great and there are some fantastic shots. The soundtrack is fantastic and is an important part of the emotion that comes from the film. The plot itself is, however, a little bland, a lot is predictable and the characters are all pretty dull. The message of the film is a good one, 'get out there and see the world - don't spend your whole life working etc etc' - something like that, but it's sort of ruined by the underlying 'do it so you can get a girlfriend' and that throughout the film all of the amazing things that Walter does are mostly just to impress some coworker that he fancies, not to help himself. It's a bit of a soppy film really, and for the amount of the film that is just about Ben Stiller's character, Walter, you'd of thought that you might become a bit more attached to his character, but i never did. Finally, another running joke in the film was Todd from the online dating website, which was very mildly amusing but i felt that it actually ruined some of the more magnificent moments - the same way a phone call ruins a good film (I'm not sure if it was meant to be ironic or not). I wouldn't go and see it again, nor would i strongly recommend it to anyone - unless they're looking for an easy feel good film. I'd of preferred it without the comic relief scattered throughout, and maybe without the 'romantic' aspect - for a man so fed up with everything he shouldn't need a girl full of cheesy sayings to push him out into the world.fin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Walter Mitty" misfires on several cylinders...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NEW YORK FILM FESTIVAL: The East Coast crowd was the first to finally get a look at Ben Stiller's long-awaited remake of "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" in which he stars with Academy Award nominee Kristen Wiig and Academy Award winners Shirley MacLaine and Sean Penn. Expectations were high following a trailer that wowed many with its visual style and seemingly interesting premise. In the end, Stiller's take on the 1947 classic is rather bombastic and brings forth narrative clichés and messy executions. This isn't to say it's a complete misfire. There are definite and obvious positives to take away. The entire camera work by Stuart Dryburgh, most notable for his work on Jane Campion's "The Piano" twenty years ago, is smoothly appealing with stunning shots for the audience to sink their teeth into. As the film travels throughout different parts of the world including Iceland and Greenland, two places that haven't been explored that much in film according to screenwriter Steve Conrad, are stunning. We have to give credit to director Stiller who knows how to frame his films exceedingly well. There are elements where he takes his cues from films like "Stranger than Fiction" and "Garden State." At the press conference he mentioned watching "The Apartment" with the cast in order to get a feel for what he wanted this sprawling epic to feel like. Unfortunately, "Walter Mitty" doesn't resemble nor bring any of the feelings that the Oscar-winning Best Picture was able to achieve.Attempting to take Stiller on as a "visionary" director seemed a bit far-fetched when his filmography have included the comedic greats like "Tropic Thunder" and "Reality Bites." This is surely his most ambitious effort he's attempted. One thing is for sure, Stiller hasn't been this good in front of the camera in his entire career. While the narrative structure of "Walter Mitty" is incredibly uneven and stereo typically constructed, Stiller puts some of his acting chops forward. It's good to see him in something like this. A Golden Globe nomination could definitely come his way. Steve Conrad's script is a jumbled farce, misfiring on comedic executions and inserting beats that have no real relevance to the story. A "Benjamin Button" joke, though funny to watch, provides no purpose to our tale. I'm also tired of watching the "nerdy office guy" transform himself into the cool and collected man by film's end. Note to filmmakers, just because your main character is in a shirt and tie at the beginning of the movie, you can't just let them grow a beard, put on a sweater and jeans, and suddenly the audience is supposed to believe he's this "new person." This movie is an epic fantasy tale about a man who daydreams about things that would be more outlandish than the real world. There's a false sense of reality when we're in the "real world." Jumping on a plane, suddenly flying across the world, and then receiving cell phone reception in the Himalayas is not exactly something that would happen in today's age.Kristen Wiig really tries, god bless her soul. Playing our love interest Cheryl, Wiig is a recently divorced, single mom who, for no real reason whatsoever, takes an interest in Walter's "mystery" that he must solve. Wiig's "moment" is unfortunately cut short by a directorial choice by Stiller. A scene of her playing guitar and singing the first few bars of "Space Odyssey" by David Bowie builds up before being cut short by an insertion of the original number. Wasted. It did make me pop it in on my way home so I guess it's not a complete miss.Oscar winners Sean Penn and Shirley MacLaine are the best of the cast, using their veteran style and wits to make a wonderful and memorable impression. Same goes for Kathryn Hahn, who needs a great role in the near future. She's versatile in comedy as we've seen in "Step Brothers" but she excels just as well in serious, heartbreaking turns like in "Revolutionary Road." She doesn't have much to offer our tale in this case. No fault of her own. Should also mention that Adam Scott from NBC's "Park and Recreation" is probably one of the funniest villains of the year. His comedic timing is pretty spot on and continues to shine in sleazy, douchebag roles.Let's not forget that this tale builds up to a final image that is rather anti-climatic and much of a letdown. I can appreciate the respect and passion that Stiller has for the source material and more times than not, the film is entertaining. Mass audiences will probably fall for it in a big way especially around the holidays. From the looks of it, the film is going to be incredibly divisive. Some will love it, others will be disappointed. I unfortunately fall more towards the latter of that equation. "Walter Mitty" is a decent time at the movie and is definitely in contention for several technical Oscars. Things like Production Design, Cinematography, and Visual Effects are possibilities."The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" opens in theaters December 25.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ben Stiller is no Danny Kaye, and this movie is no Walter Mitty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't want to be cruel to Ben Stiller, but this movie will be crap to anybody who has seen the original. Ben Stiller played Walter Mitty one dimensional. ie not funny. Danny Kaye played Walter Mitty multi dimensional, very funny, as only Danny Kaye could do in the Hollywood of the day.Ben Stiller could replace Norman Wisdom in any remake of Norman Wisdom Movies. But The Secret Life of Walter Mitty?, forget it.I could write for a week about how bad this film was. But I wont.I've ticked spoilers but I don't think I've left any.The biggest disappointment for me was Ben Stiller came across far to much like Norman Wisdom.Danny Kaye's original Walter Mitty was exceptional. This remake is just boring. I have read most of the positive reviews. These people must have watched a different movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like standing on the edge of a mountain when a gush of breeze hits you, you close your eyes and take a deep breath, that is the feeling that this movie gives to you. It is the journey of a dreamer and how his life changes. We all would find a small part of ourselves in Walter Mitty, of how we wanted our lives to be and how we've ended, of all the whims that have just ended up as mere dreams. More than just a movie, it is an experience filled with breathtaking cinematography, serene locations, over the top acting by Ben Stiller and the Crew and a script that would change the way you look at things and in the end you'll be left with all smiles and maybe an odd teardrop across your eye. Enjoy the Ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an amazing adventure. While Mitty is a sort of reserved kinda guy he's delightfully quirky and boy does he have a colorful imagination! The transition fantasy scenes were jam packed with oodles of stylistic verve and oh my the nostalgic moments! You'll be reminded of old toys you used to love to play with. The acting was great. There weren't any characters I wish weren't in it and I didn't feel like any of the characters fell short. Pacing was great - Run time didn't feel too short or too long.I can't wait to watch it all over again! My favorite film of 2013 and my now favorite Ben Stiller film. Enjoy the Mittyesque moments when you can. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember watching the trailer of "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" and thinking: "wow, this looks different and cool" and now that I've watched the movie, I can that it exactly this."The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" has a pretty interesting plot, with a very likable main character and, on top of that, it's just cool to watch because there lots of cool sequences in it. The guy has some very crazy daydreams and he also travels the world doing some insane things.The film has a good pace (it could be better though), the visuals are awesome and the soundtrack is pretty decent too. And it's also a movie that makes you think (a little bit) about what life is.Some people are talking about product placement in this movie... Well, all I can say is that I didn't notice them. I mean, yeah, while watching the film I saw some brands here and there, but they never really distracted me from what was happening in the movie. They were all very well integrated in the scenes and I don't believe this movie has more product placement than what we're used to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty The upside to online magazines is that there will be free tablets with old issues on them at the dentist's office.Alternatively, the downside to this digitization is explored in this comedy-fantasy.With the final issue of LIFE magazine ready to publish, it's up to negative handler Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) to present the last cover photo shot by famed photojournalist Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn).The only problem is the negative has disappeared.Now it's up to the daydreaming office drone to place the misplaced image before the issue goes to print.To do this, he must travel to Iceland to find O'Connell. While Walter's trajectory from skateboarding punk to milquetoast adult is incongruent, it is this film's sappy ending that gives the James Thurber's short story a bad name.Furthermore, with Life magazine now out of the way, there's less confusion between Life cereal and Life the board game.

		<fullReview>Taking photography as a hobby, I find "Secret Life of Walter Mitty" inspirational for me. The character that inspired me was Sean O'Connell. His character is a very awesome one for me. This type of characters could make you "pack your bags and embark on an adventure" feels. I'm also really amazed by the cinematography. The choice of sceneries and special effects was really awesome that you wished you could go there. This is one of the movies that made me felt that the daily routines I make in life won't me make fully realize what life really meant. I watched it again with my cousin when I realized that they still lack a bit when it comes to the story. I mean the cinematography is great but I got easily bored with the storyline. For me, I would watch it again for the sceneries and the extraordinary expeditions of Walter Mitty. I'm just remembering other movies that have characters that have this kind of issues too. Issues that they haven't fully experienced what life really meant. The difference the movie made is that Walter Mitty just daydream about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching one of the best films I've seen all year!! Within 6 minutes, I was pulled thoroughly into "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty".This charming film was a feast to my eyes, ears...and especially to my heart. An engaging storyline with an genuine and affable main character. The rich deep texture to the film itself made me wish I had seen it on the big screen (how did I miss this at the theater??). The music/soundtrack was equally delicious in way that seemed so very inspirational and sweet...and yet, at the same time haunting. I can tell this film will linger with me for a long time...Two thumbs up!!!&gt;&gt; Quotes from the film &lt;&lt; "I live by my ABC: Adventurous, Brave and Creative." ~ Walter Mitty"To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, to draw closer, to find each other and to feel.

		<fullReview>A morose mid life crisis struck narrative, the kind of thoughts that men fantasize, to be a hero, to be somebody although there is no sheer chance that you could be one is something that this movie begins to portray with a great escape that leads you to believe life is too short to live it in regret. Beautiful photography, heavenly locations and great acting by Stiller makes this a very very wonderful watch. The music score is also splendid. I sometimes wonder what would it take to lose yourself by breaking out of your regular routine and explore the world and this movie explores and recreates those same thoughts in a very elegant manner. Great for eyes, special effects and acting. Also a splendid story of our everyday lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My humble opinion :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My younger sister recommended this movie after seeing it in our local theater so a day or two later I asked my girlfriend to come see a movie with me. I didn't bother to watch the trailer (neither did she), the only info we had was my sisters short explanation "It's about Ben Stiller daydreaming and he goes on some kind of adventure, that's all I can tell you, just go watch it". I wasn't really intrigued or anything but me and my sister share a lot of interests and taste in cinema so I was willing to give it a go?Never before have I been so pleasantly surprised by a film, ever.The beginning threw us off a little, I was worried about the whole movie to be daydreaming-bits (although they were quite awesome!), but as the film progressed I was drawn in. When the actual adventure began I was totally mesmerized by The Secret Live of Walter Mitty, the cinematography was amazing, I felt excitement for the character, his 'quest' was intriguing and fun, as the story progressed we were both totally into this beautiful piece of film.Having said this, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was obviously enjoyable (and relatable!) for me, but I can understand that others won't give it a chance and would leave halfway through based purely on one simple theory;(this is NOT to offend anyone, just my humble opinion, you can skip this part if you're not interested in my theory)Personally I'm a 'creative person', I paint, I draw, photography is one of my passions, I love to get lost on my motorcycle with nothing but my camera on me and enjoy the moment of 'being lost', I can spend hours on end after I finish my day at the office just drawing and painting, it's what I do and what makes me happy. (this goes for my girlfriend as well and to a curtain extend also applies to my sister) This often is accompanied by daydreaming, a lot of daydreaming. I think that the reason I LOVED this film is because it's relatable, all of it.And this brings me to the people who think this movie blows, I've talked quite a bit about this movie with a broad audience, and (this is my experience!) the people who hated it are mostly the most down-to-earth men and women I know, they have a great job, a steady income, save money for their retirement, drive a safe leased car, know exactly where they want to be in 1, 5, 10 and even 20 years and plan everything in advance. There is nothing wrong with being in said group, I'd love to be able to get a grip on my life like they do, but my mind kind of ?wanders sometimes.Once again, I'm not writing this review to offend or sell short a specific group of people, the conversations were all with co-workers, friends and family, I love all of them as much as I would my 'creative' ?friends, family and co-workers!In my experience the dreamers, creative minds, wanderers and adventurous people I've talk to about this movie were all very excited and loved it (or went to go see it because of the conversation). The realists, planners, play-it-safe and goal-setters didn't seem that interested in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, they kind of switched topics fairly early into the conversation and/or didn't bother to see the film. This is probably why this piece of awesomeness (my opinion ;)) got such mixed reviews, it seems like people either love it, or hate it, there doesn't seem to be an in-between-crowd!After having share my 'theory' I will cut off this review by saying I LOVED The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, it is one of my all-time favorites and I rate it a perfect 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who hasn't daydreamed about their perfect life? We can all relate to this film, whether it's that horrible boss at work, getting bullied, self confidence issues, impressing that girl you like. This is what makes Mitty such an enjoyable experience!Visually stunning and thought provoking, it pushes the boundaries but in a good way! You really get the see Stiller in a different light but an interesting light. The plot is entertaining but kept simple and so it should be so that it can carry that universal message that, "Everything has a purpose". The acting is good. Who else is better playing the horrible villain than Adam Scott? Ben Stiller's directorial approach is spot on, the landscapes are visually beautiful and I can't wait to see what he does in the future!The soundtrack is a reason to see this film alone! Amazing. Perfectly intertwined which fitted the movie perfectly. Honest and uplifting! Personally, "Jose Gonzalez" and "Of Monsters And Men" the stand outs for me. If you are looking for a entertaining, adventure film that is uplifting and well performed than look no further! Give it a chance!</fullReview>

It is one of those movies that you watch and makes you want to do things, and travel and live your life to the fullest. It's an inspirational story about a man who is alive but not really living, and then one day everything changes and he's forced to try new things.

		<shortDescription>A breathtaking, inspiring piece of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Daydreaming. We all do it, some more than others but Walter Mitty does it on a whole new scale.After watching this, I realised that The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was originally a short story written in 1939 and was adapted into a film a few years later in 1947. A few directors have tried to get their hands on it since 1994 but it constantly fell through due to budgets, directors and actors pulling out. That's until Ben Stiller signed on.Ben Stiller's lovable but lonely Walter is the heart of the story. Walter is lonely in a sense that he doesn't put himself out there, resulting in him going out of his comfort zone to find the missing photo. He looks on longingly day by day at Cheryl who waves in his direction but is actually waving at her friend behind him. He works on one of the lower floors of the building with one other colleague and only emerges for lunch or when the day is over, and gets hurled abuse from his new asshole boss. Ben Stiller nails Walter's vulnerability and all of this makes you hope he succeeds from the first 5 minutes.The scenery is absolutely breathtaking. Filmed in Iceland, New York and California, Stiller's directing shows the true beauty of their landscapes.Day-dreams full of romance, heroism, action and utter strangeness, and the perfect amount of wit from comedy queen Kristen Wigg, Walter Mitty is an inspiration. Powerful lessons throughout will make you think of life in a new light - "life shouldn't be taken for granted", "If you want to do something, do it" and "If you never try, you'll never know" are just a few that might just change your life like it did Walter's. A brilliant directorial debut for Stiller, and if Walter Mitty is anything to go by, expect big things in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first heard about Walter Mitty during English class in high school. The teacher just raved about this character. I remembered Mitty as a bumbling, ignorant fool who spent his life lost in thought about being involved in make-believe situations. Mitty the super-hero, as it were -- in the parlance of today's talk.I knew about the Danny Kaye movie. I saw it, and I thought that it was good. Since then, I have noticed some actual people who act like Walter and are always lost in their very inventive fantasies.I liked the Ben Stiller movie. I immediately recognized Sean Penn, right when he was first seen in this movie. I marveled at his sage sayings near the end when Mitty finally found him. This was a famous photographer, and Mitty and Mitty's mother (the wonderful Shirley MacLaine) actually knew him, FOR REAL. I did not know Stiller was a movie producer. I feel that he did a good job both as producer and lead actor. I remember his parents from when they were on TV a long time ago. They were a very talented pair.Stiller was very sweet as Walter Mitty. Mitty was a very dedicated magazine employee. He had a very loyal assistant, who was very helpful in trying to find the missing photograph. The actress, who became Mitty's love interest, was very kind. Mitty made a nice gesture in giving her son the skateboard.Walter was relentless in looking for the photographer. He traveled internationally, at a great distance. He met nice people. The scenery was lovely and breathtaking. A great scene was when Mitty skateboarded a long distance. The helicopter scenes were quite good.10/10</fullReview>

But this film is for the men who escape daily horrible reality. Usually it is not so horrible, but some of them can not cope. Usually they do not have the money to escape, but they still do. I find them crawling daily in the poverty which happens so regularly after they escape. Well babes you can day dream if you have enough cash to do that, if you do not you will find yourself digging garbage somewhere for food trying to survive.Well I really want to thank all that contributed to this film, and they made it according to my biography.

Its about a story of a man who we all can relate to as like Walter Mitty, sometimes we also zone out and day dreams. But it's exciting to see Walter Mitty to finally see how he achieves his target by finally finding the man of the need. Also, it's a nice watch for any age group. And if you are a stiller fan, then just go for the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I got the key...I got the secret</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I am not really a fan of Ben Stiller films and when I saw this advertised I tuned out. Then my daughters said they wanted to see it and being the totally awesome fathers that I am I put aside my opinions and took them to see it. Well.....I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised to see Stiller in a role that wasn't just him goofing around. I could relate to his character somewhat in regards to being a bit of a daydreamer myself and perhaps the feeling that if I'd travelled the world would that make me a more interesting person. This film kind of answered that for me. no it wouldn't. The films overall message for me was that perhaps the greatest adventure is finding (and holding on to) love. A nice bit of escapism and lovely cinematography made this a surprising find for me. I enjoyed it and so did my kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie made for the day-dreamer in you. We all have had our momentary slips out of the real world to a world where music shapes our every move and where no one can touch our reality. This movie is a "get off the couch and pack your bags" story full of amazing sounds and visuals. I highly recommend this movie to everyone who has ever dreamed of going on great adventures and making random connections with people who share this thrill of life. This just might be the trigger that would launch you in a whirlpool of finally doing things you have been postponing your whole life. Take a week off work.. Dream Big.. And leave moderation and your white collar at the office</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie will inspire you!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a real disservice to write a bad review about this movie. It would also be unfortunate for you to read a negative review about The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and not view it. This movie is INSPIRING. Walter Mitty has an overactive imagination. Partially due to his boring life. He had things he wanted to do but never did because of a family tragedy and because of that he takes his mundane situations and creates wild, over the top fantasies. Somewhere along the way, he begins to participate in life and actually have adventures instead of sitting back and dreaming about them. What is wrong with that? Why all the negative reviews? If you base your satisfaction of this movie on the original story or even the original movie then you are going to be disappointed. This is not anything like that at all. This is much more. This movie could possibly inspire you to really "LIVE" instead of dream.."DO" instead of being all talk.."HAVE YOUR OWN ADVENTURES" instead of watching someone else have them. The movie is excellent, every song makes you feel as fulfilled as the scene its put in, the actors are excellent and everyone plays their part to the fullest. Overall, it leaves you feeling happy and inspired. Don't take that away from people who need inspiration to keep going. There are more of us in the world who need this than who don't. "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived."

A clean flick with beautiful cinematography and a journey to some not-so-often-seen locations like Greenland and Iceland. Also the cast was really good, every character was very well cast. Some really good funny lines/scenes, ... also the daydreaming (zoned out) segments. And a happy ending is the frosting on the cake. This film shows that you can make a PG-rated film that is interesting, touching, funny and exciting to watch. It felt very good spending the money for the ticket to see this flick.

		<shortDescription>Get Past The First Forty Minutes And You've Struck Gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After viewing the trailer I was quite curious about this film, at least curious enough that I felt the need to go to the theater and buy a ticket to watch it. I have two bad things to say about this film and they didn't drag my rating down too much because I felt that the rest of the movie was excellent. So, the first forty minutes of the film weren't as good as I'd hoped, I found it kind of boring and personally, I thought his daydreams were stupid but I have to say that it was understandable why it was so boring at first. After all, you introduce a character who's never been anywhere or done anything, the end result should be boring and I think that's what the writers were trying to get you to understand, that his life was so boring he started daydreaming to put meaning into it. After that the movie became exciting and heartwarming and it took a drastic turn from where it had first started off. The acting was wonderful, the directing was excellent, and the writing was perfect. It wasn't quite good enough to make me rate it ten stars but it was very close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hindered By One Scene (Possible Spoilers???)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it amazing how one scene can change your perspective on a film, for better or worse. Often, a film can trudge along until one pivotal moment propels it to greatness, or vice versa. With Ben Stiller's The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, the scene in question proves to be one of its few flaws. Walter Mitty (played with nuance by a superb Stiller) is a resident of a bygone era. His wardrobe consists of a drab gray palette, echoing the black-and-white images of a dying generation. He never does anything fun or exciting, preferring to keep to himself, a symbol of the suburban flight of the postwar 1950s. He works for Life magazine, a publication which in real life went digital over a decade ago, processing black-and- white photographs, the old-fashioned way. It is no coincidence that Stiller injects symbolism into his film: its very premise necessitates that he address certain dichotomies. Chief among them is the struggle to update a 1939 short story into a relevant 2013 film. Stiller (and screenwriter Steve Conrad) address these disparities by leaving Walter in the past while the world moves on without him. In his own way, Walter Mitty is the consummate symbol of the "boomer" generation. He feels a strange disconnect from the increasingly digitized world around him, underscored by his fear of associating with the new and his preference for isolation in what he knows best. His inevitable journey of self-discovery, then, is both a tribute to things we consider obsolete and a rational plea for inter- generational communication.I cannot say enough about how good this film is. The acting, the writing, the direction and cinematography are all top-notch. But there is still the issue of the aforementioned key scene. In reality, the scene is not vital at all: it is a complete throwaway, and should have stayed on the cutting room floor. See, Mitty likes to daydream. A lot. They are elaborate and detailed daydreams, too, and Stiller indulges us in all manner of special-effects laden whimsy when portraying them. But in one particular dream, where Walter imagines himself as Fitzgerald's Benjamin Button, Ben Stiller lapses into, well, Ben Stiller territory. It's a stupid gag played for stupid laughs, and it completely took me out of the movie's rhythmic flow. Its colors are from a different film, its acting is hammy and cheap. And after Mitty was over, I was left with two thoughts: the first was that it was a great film, and the second was that it was hindered by one scene.Walter Mitty is easily Stiller's best directorial effort, a layered, gentle portrait of a life well-lived. It falls just short of being a classic, though, because of a minor directorial indulgence, a faux pas that ultimately reminds us that Stiller has yet to reach his full potential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever wondered about finding the purpose of your life ? This question will linger onto your mind until you will come across a moment that will strike the chord in your heart and you will realize your presence felt in this beautiful world.A day-dreamer travels through different terrains of world in search of a negative copy of the photo that he is supposed to published in the LIFE magazine.Directed and acted by Ben Stiller, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a gripping drama that tells about a journey lonely, 40-something depressed man through fantasy world coupled with action, adventure,heroism and daring. The movie takes some time for you to grasp but once it gains steam, you will embark on an odd journey into the lap of nature. Beautiful scenic and exotic locations of Greenland, Iceland and Himalayas is an icing on the cake. Many folks will find it weird as it takes through the series of imagination but guess what - it is still enjoyable. Ben Stiller does a tremendous job as Walter Mitty. He will surprise you when he transforms himself from a common boring man into an adventurous enthusiast. Kristin Wig is cheering and full of life as usual.Overall, thumbs up to gritting and gratifying drama. Excellent 4.5/5</fullReview>

Sean Penn was great as the obsessed photographer caught in the moment, and Ben Stiller's character also really shone. Not really a comedy, it was quite light, and yet the back-story of not giving up and taking that leap of faith was very inspiring. Not at all what I was expecting. There was no over-the-top special effects. It was actually extremely believable. It was a great feel-good movie, and I'd recommend watching this to anyone who asked. :)</fullReview>

I loved James Thurber's classic story of a daydreamer. When I sat in the theater, I thought the movie would be different. I was thinking that this would be a "good" movie..I was wrong about thinking this was a good movie. It was a GREAT movie. Ben Stiller's performance here was amazing including his co-stars: Kristen Wiig, Adam Scott, Shirley Maclaine and the rest. This movie was truly inspiring and extremely entertaining. It's Oscar-worthy in my opinion. This is a special movie for those who want to see something inspiring. I know some critics may say this is boring and unoriginal or whatever, I totally disagree. Trust me, you're going to love this amazing film. This is Ben Stiller's greatest movie yet in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You may think of Ben Stiller whatever you want but he knows how to make a good, warm, touching, emotional movie, occasionally even funny. The movie is well paced and (almost - some scenes should have been cut out, like the one with Mitty becoming an "old baby") everything is in place. Even the music. And, of course, Mr. Penn. I also would not compare this "version" with the one filmed in 1947. They are basically two different things and each one shall have its audience but they will not mix together. You like either this one or that one. I like this one, since I got from it far too much than I've expected. A happy ending love story born in the heart of devastating capitalism (which I define as "destroy the old, no matter the cost and how good it was and accepted by the people, and create something new - or better: contemporary - although it is usually much worse than it was. just destroy. sacrifice everything to the Profit God. who cares about the people, anyway.") This movie delivers somewhat an optimistic message. Good old stuff shall survive since it is essentially good. Most of this new stuff shall have a lifespan of a butterfly (and shall also be destroyed for something newer). Except for this movie. It will always be a classic.</fullReview>

It was and still is one the best movies I ever watched, and while I have no complaints on the new version, in my opinion Danny Kay was better as Mitty. Naturally, modern technology help the new version to look far better on the screen that the old one, but I can still vividly remember many parts of the old movie I watched as a high school student. I recommend all the reviewers of the Stiller movie to get the DVD of the Danny Kay classic and try to compare. I am sure they would be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for Everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This title is not what most would consider an "every man" movie; however, it is a good film nonetheless. To be honest, I've never been a big fan of either Ben Stiller or Kristen Wiig, and this movie has not necessarily changed my opinion. I will say, though, that I was more than impressed by the performance of each in this film. Stiller is aloof yet charismatic with a certain appeal to the more thoughtful and serious of this generation; Wiig is pragmatic and genuine. Both characters share a feeling discontentment with their lives. Wiig seems to understand the importance of remaining engaged in reality yet lives with a bad taste in her mouth, embracing the foulness that repulses her. On the other hand, Stiller escapes his discontent by "zoning out" into an ever prevalent daydream, finding purpose in fantasy rather than reality. The way this movie was filmed found beauty in the simplicity of life as well as the grandeur, often at the same time. The shots of Stiller skating through Iceland are sublime, from the breathtaking scenery to Stiller's euphoric expressions. At this point I would be remiss if I made no mention of Adrian Martinez, Sean Penn, Adam Scott, and Olafur Darri Olafsson. The roles of each were cast to near perfection. I would be hard pressed to come up with anyone better suited for those roles. In many respects, they are the backbone of this movie, and despite their lack of on-screen time I thought their characters were surprisingly well developed. I don't know how involved Stiller was in casting or developing the sceenplay (I'm assuming a fair amount) but kudos to him regardless. It may not be one of the best movies ever, but it is well made and especially thought provoking. Undoubtedly one of my favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Secretly Slow Good Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts a bit slow for the set up, but also includes much of Walter "zoning" out, where he stares off into space and dreams about exciting things that he wishes would happen. There are the standard scenarios that we see from the previews but also a few more that were quite entertaining. Walter has a bit of a boring job, and is obliged to take care of his mother since his father passed away and his sister is? not so much of a help. He also is searching for romance on an online dating profile and is interested in a girl in the work place but doesn't have the life experience to fill out the profile or the guts to ask his workplace colleague out. Circumstances however, get set in motion to fulfill these parts of his life and he goes on quite an adventure throughout the world figuring it out.Once he starts traveling on his journey he doesn't zone out much anymore, and while the various locales are visually appealing, it's nothing compared to his imaginative endeavors. This is one of the only disappointments I have. While a drama, and not a fast one at times, it's family rated, and does the trick for the most part. The Good: Mitty's (Stiller) awesome escapisms, his girl playing a guitar, elevator fight, street fight, etc. (things you wish you could do in real life but would die attempting many of them)The Bad: Not enough daydreaming as the film gets to the halfway point, and pacing is a tad slow because of it.Characters: Stiller plays a good Mitty. Penn is mostly absent but fine, Wiig is not typical Wiig here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cross between Sherlock Holmes and Forrest Gump</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Consider this a cross between Sherlock Holmes and Forrest Gump ? a compelling search to save professional integrity erases an awkward search for social acceptance. What is life like for Walter Mitty, an asset manager of film negatives? It's so dull, monotonous and unsocial, working in a dark basement with albums of film, that he is given to frequent daydreams of fun, excitement and adventure in the middle of conversations. He cannot even manage a profile on e-Harmony to meet women because he has no life outside of work. Walter is a fumbling, socially awkward, pushover who is sadly the butt of jokes. But all this is about to change when his publishing company transitions from paper magazines to the Internet. They are scheduled to publish the last cover but somehow the negative from their solitary geographic photographer, Sean, goes mysteriously missing. To save his job and the reputation of the magazine, Walter is thrust into the impossible position of covering for the lost negative while privately investigating clues for the whereabouts of the adventurous photographer and hunting him down. He must solve the puzzle of elusive clues in Sean's negatives to find his trail. In so doing, Walter travels the world taking unexpected life threatening risks with every opportunity. He is relentless and determined to save face yet ironically he builds a repertoire of experiences for his e-Harmony profile. In his pursuit he befriends his co-worker, Cheryl, with whom he has always had a secret crush. He uses every conceivable resource one can imagine, including Cheryl, to find Sean, even giving up at one point when the trail runs cold. Like Forrest Gump, Walter Mitty never knows what life will throw his way. The ending is quite unexpected and I won't give it away. The film gets off to a slow start but the script, acting, outstanding cinematography and storyline make up for this. Although far-fetched, I find this to be a believable dramatic and funny story. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My 4 year old daughter asked me what the film I saw today was about, and I said, "Well, a man feels shy and sad and doesn't like his life. Then he goes on overseas adventures that make him feel confident, strong, and enjoy his life." That nutshell shows how generic the film is at heart, but who cares? It was great.This film is another in a long line of films that show how comedians can make fantastic dramatic actors. Think Jim Carrey in The Truman Show and Will Ferrell in Stranger Than Fiction. I never look too much in to films before I see them (don't like them being built up too much) so was surprised to see in the credits that Stiller also produced and directed it. It certainly is a work he can be proud of.I found the gentle quietness of the film endearing, the musical score and scenery inspirational, and the standard 'find yourself' theme delivered effectively. The comedy was constant, but not overdone, and the serious parts weren't overly sentimental. Everything was in balance.It's a film that makes you leave the cinema wanting to go out and change your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sheer Class. Ben Stiller: you sir, are a very fine actor and director. Good job.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best films of 2013. It is deserving of a 10 simply because I can't give it a 9.5 on here. It's a big budget Hollywood effort with an Indie-movie heart and Art-house touch. It has everything. I very nearly avoided this movie because of previously negative reviews and some bad press. I am so glad I didn't. I began watching with low expectation and having made assumptions about what I was about to see from Ben Stiller. How wrong was I? 30 minutes in I turned around to my 11 year old son who was watching with me and said to him that this was a really cool movie. He agreed. It was a brilliant scene where Walter shared his skateboarding skills with young Richard. It was a short scene but so powerfully done and the timing of the edits was absolutely perfect. When you watch it, you will know what I mean. It conveyed Walter's humanity perfectly.From this point onward, for me, the film's quality began to really emerge. Slowly at first, and then it begins to accelerate as we travel with Walter to Greenland, Iceland and Afghanistan. Beautifully shot, amazing colours, and a stunning soundtrack make this film a truly wonderful viewing experience. It has moments of silly humour, touching humour, tenderness and moments that make you think deeply about what makes us tick. There is some outstanding cinematography: Walter skateboarding down the main route to Iceland's Sey?isfjör?ur through Fjar?arhei?i heath is breath-taking in its brilliance and the soccer match in which Walter and Sean (Penn) kick a ball with local Afghanis until the sun slips slowly below the horizon are stand-outs.Ben Stiller's most understated and best performance to date. Sean Penn's few minutes of screen time confirms he is not only a fine actor but that he can find the finest subtle comedy when he needs to without foregoing drama we know him for. Shirely MacLaine was the perfect mum character and Kirsten Wiig is genuinely sincere as Walter's new friend. Adam Scott even does his bit when he realises it is he and not Walter who is the 'loser' in life.Watch this film. It won't be what you might expect, but it will take you on a wonderful journey, a truly wonderful journey whose destination will leave you very satisfied indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just came home after watching this movie in theatre with a smile.Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) is a 42 year old guy who has worked for past 16 years as a photo negative asset management for LIFE magazine. He day-dreams about him being adventures &amp; sporty guy, recently with his co-worker Cheryl Melhoff(Kristen Wiig). He is persistent in his work &amp; favorite of star photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) to him he never have met personally. LIFE magazine is about shut down to remain only on internet form. For it's last cover photo Sean O'Connell has recommended a special photo which Walter can't find in received package, which also has Sean's letter. Here Walter's journey begins to find Sean who is old school who does not use phone and roams around the world all the time.At the first 15 mins you wonder whats going on, Walter is just 'zoned out' , he and his disconnected day dreams. But it really picks up in a while, thru chemistry between Walter and his family - mother n sister, his child hood stories, his meeting with Cheryl and her son, and when he decides to find Sean starting first trail to Greenland. Then there are stunning cinematography combined with perfect soundtrack, amazing rides and funny situations which of course are like day dreams. Every one desires of some adventure in life, very few step up for it. I think movie is about that-step up spirit. If you like these kind of movies then don't listen to those low rated comments, go for it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty&#xfeff; really surprised me, and you will be too. From the way they are selling this it all looks like make believe, and the crazy dreams of a man lost in his own fantasy world in which he is a superhero, or macho man, I was worried that this was going to be like Bedazzled, just puffy little disconnected scenes. That is not what this movie is. The first 10-15 minutes yeah that is exactly what you get, and that really had me worried for what was to come. There is a tipping point for Mitty though, and Ben Stiller&#xfeff; is just so great at being real, and making Mitty take the leaps of faith that he needs to to really earn the life that he has always wanted. Kristen Wiig&#xfeff; is very subtle, and just the right sort of inspiration that the movie needed, there is no sign of Lola Bunny, just a Mom that Mitty dreams could love him. Well I Enjoyed this movie so much more than I was expecting to even Shirley MacLaine is sweet as her amazing cake. I recommend this movie for anyone, from anywhere who would like to stand up, or just step out once in a while. Go for it!</fullReview>

This remake produced by, directed by, and starring one-time ZOOLANDER Ben Stiller dispenses with all but one reality: the American Little Man is getting the shaft. Except for a deplorable segue into BENJAMIN BUTTON, this flick stays mostly on course, and is more than a two-hour ad for Papa John's Pizza. The scenery in Greenland, Iceland, and Afghanistan is spectacular, so who cares if Stiller and Sean Penn actually were there, or if they were superimposed on mountain ridges by the hundreds of technical people listed in the credits? This version of WALTER MITTY preaches that each of these little Techies is at least as important to the finished product as Mr. Stiller himself. That is a Truth mostly squandered in America today, as Big Money won't let the Little Guy have anything for himself--the Fatcats even stole YouTube! But the Bible says the Walter Mitty's will inherit the Earth, and have the last laugh watching all the rich men stuck in the eyes of needles (trying to ascend to Heaven)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was an absolute delight. I worried that having seen the trailer (massively overlong trailer) I would have seen pretty much the whole film. I was pleasantly wrong. The film is very warm and funny. I am not a big Ben Stiller fan but his portrayal was very contained and not his normal over the top characterisations. Kirsten Wiig is as good as ever.It's the overall composition that steals the show though. From the manic superhero like special effects scenes to the sumptuous vistas the movie is a visual treat. Evening the opening titles have a touch of magic about them.Ben Stiller's directing is great and whoever put the soundtrack together was spot on.Absolutely wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie easy to be misunderstood as a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for that movie, I was like: "Wow, this one has potential." Even when I read several short reviews (DER SPIEGEL, www.reihesieben.de) that were rather negative, I wanted to see for myself. And boy, was I flattened.The shy Walter Mitty lives a pretty dull life in his flat. He quietly adores his colleague Sheryl Melhoff at his work - the LIFE Magazine. Life gets bumpy when the magazine is changed into an Online-Magazine and the last issue of the paper version will be published. Walter loses the negative of the final cover and has to get it quickly, before the evil Manager Ted Hendricks loses his temper. The search for the negative leads Walter to Greenland, Iceland and Afghanistan, up the Himalaya and back to the USA.You will get awesome scenery and pictures of the vast ice fields of the Himalaya, the great green plains of Green- and Iceland. The daydreams of Walter Mitty are always embedded into the normal life and can be quite cool (surfing the streets of New York, rescuing a three-legged dog from an explosion,...).The movie never drifts into the cheap laughs corner and always stays funny in its seriousness. I can recommend this 100% and I can only hope, that the Academy will notice that movie - if its for the camera work or the pictures; it would be great.You can't see that the movie started back in 2005 and went through several changes in cast and staff. A nice flick for couples on a quiet romantic evening - go watch it, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty has many things going for it, and I'm glad the public seem to rate it more accurately than the critics as I feel it is certainly deserving of its 7.7-8 rating on here. It has many things going for it. The scenery is spectacular and the whole film oozes adventure. Little seen places such as Greenland and Afghanistan show up in a great light and like all good adventure stories, this one makes the viewer want to pack up their travel journal and set off to far-flung places in search of an adventure to call their own.The acting is good overall: Stiller is solid if not spectacular but Sean Penn really excels during his short time on screen. The humour is quirky if not laugh out loud (in most cases) and in general is effective. The often mentioned companies such as eharmony and Papa Johns add a sense of reality and modernity that eclipses talk of sell-out product placement: people saying these companies were mentioned just for product placement don't fully understand the film in my opinion. These companies are part of the real world and play a big part in the plot of the story also and so I think Stiller is justified in using them as he does.One not-so-positive aspect of the film, a pet peeve if you will, is the 'shark' scene. The fact that a what looked like a great white shark could live in ice-cold water, and just happen to be around for the few seconds when Mitty occupied it with him, seemed like a typical daydream (when Mitty zones out) but it was meant to have really happened. That for me throws some doubt over the validity of subsequent happenings such as the volcano eruption, meeting the Afghan warlords etc. I think the film would be better if the shark hadn't made an appearance at all. The ending I think is very suitable and really helps make this a feel good film. You will know what I mean when you see 25. I saw the film twice and felt it was money well spent. I think it will age well and would advise anybody who hasn't seen it yet to do so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty see's Ben Stiller not only star in the lead role as Walter but direct and produce an enjoyable fantasy family film. When watching this film dubbed 'the next Forest Gump' I have to be honest my expectations were not huge. I was however pleasantly surprised. If you are looking to escape for two hours then this film is for you. It takes you on a huge adventure and blurs the line between fantasy and reality. The film is funny, sweet and charming and the fine acting performances complement the excellent special effects. Ben Stiller plays a relatively straight role and does it very well, although he still has a few moments involving long hair and silly runs so don't worry Stiller fans! This film is quite predicable and you can figure out the end before you even see the opening title sequence, however there are some twists and turns that engage you further than the average family film.A decent film that will not change your life but maybe question it. Zone out and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walter Mitty's Inconsistent, Yet Beautiful, Journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mean, c'mon, who hasn't daydreamed about a more exciting life in which the girl of your dreams is now suddenly in your arms. Something The Secret Life of Walter Mitty surely promises is empathy. Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) is a "negative assets manager" over at Life Magazine who spends most of his day in his thoughts rather than in reality, and a fellow employee (Kristen Wiig) he works with has certainly caught his eye. Consequently, he contemplates, zones out, and pleasurably imagines heroically and properly introducing himself to her- true romance commencing from thereon. However, once someone taps him back to life and he wakes up, Mitty can only approach his crush with deepening awkwardness and nervosity. Sad is the truth, but when can we finally stop dreaming of a more invigorating and interesting version of our life and embark on that exhilarating journey we so clearly desire? The film hopes to explore that question as Walter Mitty travels across the world to locate a missing negative, and from that point forward, he finally encounters the danger, energy, and pure vastness of the real world. A major highlight of this ambitious project is its downright gorgeous visuals, taking us to the open spaces of Iceland, the grandiose Himalaya Mountains, and the dark depths of an ocean. The camera places you into some frenetic action sequences and then counters these with beautiful establishing shots of various landscapes, representing the expansive terrains of the sheer life out there, patiently waiting for us whether you're a middle-aged, distressed white-collar worker or an intrepid young adult. The editing is smooth and remarkably prevalent, playing a significant role in conveying this inspiring narrative. The soundtrack complements that sense of excitement and adventure, providing us with lively tracks from the likes of Arcade Fire and encouraging ones from artists like Of Monsters and Men. Now, the first half of the film is driven by that level of realism, relatability, and quirkiness, which I found to be very satisfying indeed. With that being said, the second half takes on a cheesier and less believable tone/path, obviously attempting to accomplish its thematic goals. Hollywood's involvement becomes perfectly transparent once the film reaches the last act, and that happy ending becomes ever happier (and unnatural). In addition, a movie that's partially fueled by comedy unfortunately doesn't deliver on enough laughs. It got a few chuckles out of me, but a considerable portion of the jokes/overall humor fell flat and simply appeared clumsy in delivery. In essence, TSLOWM works much better as a drama than a comedy (with dramatic elements). So, if you are to enter the theater with the expectations of it being a drama, you'd likely end up leaving more satisfied rather than if you entered it thinking it's another fun, inspiring comedy for the holidays. At the end of the day, if you just can't bring yourself to enjoy Walter Mitty's (inconsistent) story throughout the entire duration, chances are you still might be mesmerized by its dazzling look and spectacular production value. Regardless of its predictable and slightly corny conclusion, there is much motivation and zeal to be found in this uplifting, inspiriting tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe I'm too shallow...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But I got so bored in t his movie and lost utter interest not even half way through.I remembered when this movie came out and I was a bit tempted to see it in the theater, so glad I didn't as there really is nothing big picture worthy of it other than a few landscaping scenes that are easily forgettable. However the previews intrigued me and I've always been a Ben Stiller fan.So anyway I finally watched this and I loved the first 15+ minutes of it which is totally what I had expected, but something unexpected happened when he finally took that big leap into "action." And that is it got totally boring. Like painfully boring...I'll admit I'm more of an action guy at heart, but I enjoy a good comedy / drama and though this would fit the bill and given it's solid rating I was totally let down by just how boring it was the last 2/3 of the movie. I mean here this daydreamer finally takes the plunge, but it so unbelievable when it finally happens I can't tell whether he's still in dreamland or not, but honestly it doesn't matter as by half way in I've already so lost interest in his quest, the picture, his interest in the girl, his job. It seemed to just be taking a depressing turn and by 2/3 the way in I just totally tuned out, got up, made a snack and tuned in here and there. I saw the ending, was just as unimpressed and afterwards thought to myself "Wow... That was such a waist of time!"I guess I'm in the minority here as the picture got decent reviews, I guess it just missed my boat. If there was a higher message (and I got they were shooting for something there) I was just so not on board and unimpressed that on my scale it just fell flat as a pancake. Giving it a 1/10 as I've sat through some bad movies but couldn't sit all the way through this...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and me went to see this wonderful movie during our holidays in Monterey, California. We were in a relaxed mood already and this film added to our good feelings.I am a huge Fan of the Danny Kaye Movie with the same title. I do see this movie as a different approach to the story. And this new movie is so well done. Wow - Mr. Stiller, you did well! Some people review this movie with "remake"-eyes. Please do not. Some people don't like Ben Stoller. We do. But even if you saw Ben Stiller before - in this film he is amazing. And this is a very personal statement.... :-) We loved the choice of music and enjoyed every single second of the performances, the wonderful photography, amazing special effects, comedy (never over the top), We loved Sean Penn and especially the scenes and chemistry they had in their scenes....and felt so at ease, natural? Dito for the beautiful female cast - Mrs. MacLaine, Kristen Wiig and Kathryn Hahn - enjoyed every moment of their performance. Just grateful for having seen this movie - I would only recommend it to people who like to "zone out" a little sometimes. Isn't that what movies are meant to ... ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not really have any expectations regarding this movie. Ben Stiller is a pretty funny actor and I wanted to know how he did as a director. He did very good. This story brought a smile to my face from the first second and it stayed there the whole movie. This movie has such a big heart, even when Walter Mitty has a sad moment, you know he will be all right in the end. The daydreamer becomes the adventurer and it is very consistently done. It never gets boring, it's never too much and everything that happens to him for real is absolutely believable. The added brilliant dialogues, awesome cinematography and only great actors to the mix make this movie maybe one of the best movies of this year already.</fullReview>

She was portrayed as encouraging friend rather than 'modern, independent, fast-talking' career woman. When a man marries a woman, he is marrying a encouraging friend who stands by him, through thick-n-thin. not sex-crazed club-going feminist machine. This movie, It is a beauty !!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have rarely connected with a character or movie as much as I did with The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. There is nothing more powerful than when a comedian is given a dramatic role and hits a home-run. This well could become known as the best of Ben Stillers career. Expecting a remake of the original I was blown away by the message of the movie. The evolution of Walter from pale, drab, little noticed office worker to the man who discovers how to live was moving me to tears. The cinematography should win an Oscar. This film is beautifully shot and the completely engulfing vistas alone are worth twice the price of admission. How Walter comes to live Lifes motto is gripping. And the final cover of Life tugs at your heart. The score of the film is very well done. Ben Stiller picked the perfect songs and background music for every shot of the film. I wish the rating scale went higher than 10. Go see this film. In the theater. On the large screen. Now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an OK film, I suppose, but it didn't move me at all, and I found it no more than somewhat entertaining. Given the theme and message, this is a movie I should have loved.It's hard for me to identify what the problem was exactly. Part of it, perhaps, is that the dreamed adventure sequences were too powerful; the real adventure sequences too unrealistic. Much of it felt too artificial, too movie-ish. The evilness of the bearded guy was too cartoonish. The subplot about the missing picture was not right. The extended e-Harmony subplot didn't feel right either. We don't really get much insight into Mitty's thinking at the point when he decides to fly to Greenland. The suddenness of his transformation felt too sudden.I'm sorry, but you can't just fly to another country and start doing these amazing physical things, especially if you don't train. I mean he skateboards 16 km downhill and is barely breathing hard by the time he's finished. He jumps into freezing cold water and fights off a shark, but doesn't require medical attention afterwards. In real life he'd be in severe shock after that. Later he outdrives a pyroclastic flow, which is quite impossible. Climbing a mountain in the Himalayas just like that is not something you can do either. Anyway, I think you get the picture. It's worth about 6/10, but I'm going to bump it up because I believe in the idea of life transformation. There are many Walter Mittys in the world. Get offline and get out there.</fullReview>

As Still also produces and directs as mild manner photo editor Walter Mitty who is about to lose his job at Life Magazine. Due to the fact of going digital.Lead by his jerk of a boss Adam Scott, whom hopefully I will see in nice guy roles one day. As he does look like an actor that could do that. Still Walter is a day dreamer who instead of dreaming, he gets to live out his reality as he is trying to find a famous but elusive photographer, played by Sean Penn, in trying to get out his work for the finale issue of Life.As he tries to find Penn and travels around the world. Instead of living in the mundane world while hoping to seek out single mother Wiig, and her skateboarding loving son, Richie.Still he uses a journal to show where his late father gave to him by his mother, played by Shirley McClaine and set out and travel. Seeing the real world and not just live it out, in his imagination.Both lead actors did a great job. In rare supporting roles despite one instance with Kristen in a dream sequence. But still really a rare departure for these two. But turned out to be really good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surrealistic Coming of Age Adventure Comedy Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller coming of age as an adult comedian actor. This movie directed and starring himself as Walter Mitty brings to the screen a rather imaginative fantasy in a way that Danny Kaye's 1947 version didn't not. There is surprisingly a strong undertone of drama along with the rather sad comedy. This fusion of surreal from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), the recession employment drama from Up In the Air (2009), and the exotic geographic adventure of the rather lame but gorgeous The Loneliest Planet (2011) offers a riveting musical score that enhances the entire movie. Ben Stiller just manages to restrain the over the top fantasmagorical craziness before it rips the balance of the movie apart. Both serious and yet comically, Ben Stiller has incorporated a rich everyman story of fear, courage, romance, and liberation of the spirit in this playful movie. Much like Adam Sandler break out performance in Punch Drunk Love (2002), Ben Stiller has offered the audience with a superlative movie.</fullReview>

Other minor performances, including Shirley Maclaine, Jon Daly, Kathryn Hahn and Adrian Martinez, good enough. I did a search for the last Life magazine cover: there was a weekly (1972) and a monthly (2000). The movie does a better look, for Life. So kudos to Ben Stiller as director as well.</fullReview>

I'm not going to pan the acting , direction or photography but this just came across as a nothing film. About nothing , going nowhere and certainly nothing to warrant sitting through it.

		<shortDescription>Fanstastic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a brilliant movie. The first half of it is a little fanciful. However, in retrospect, it can be seen as some artistic licence used in the process of setting up the title character.The remainder of the movie is absolutely stunning. Coming from a music background, I see this as a true work of emotion. Stiller's true feelings shine through on this piece.Just like with silly pop songs or outrageous heavy metal, the content or structure of this movie isn't so much what makes the song as the emotion behind it. Having said that, there is nothing to fault with this film. It is extremely well made and executed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that will stay with you awhile.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for this a few months back, I was absolutely mesmerized and couldn't wait to see this film. Now that I just watched the movie, I can honestly say it met every expectation I had for it. Ben Stiller does a remarkable job directing this movie and portrays Mitty, the way he should be played. Stiller brings humor and subtlety to this role, and I don't think any other actor could have played Walter Mitty. This is definitely a feel good movie, about taking chances and making the most of "LIFE." Stiller captures all the elements of a great film. There was never a dull moment in my opinion. The cinematography is absolutely stunning and beautiful, along with the special effects, that add not only awesome daydream scenes, but witty humor, that Stiller does so well. To go along with all of that, the soundtrack fits perfectly with all of the scenes. The breathtaking scenery, along with the perfectly placed humor makes this film exciting. Stiller did a fine job in not overdoing this. He takes us on some adventure. Go see The Secret Life of Walter Mitty: It will change your perspective on life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a man in charge of the negatives of a prominent magazine, who goes in search for an important lost negative.Wow is what I have to say after watching this film. The first half has a few funny and also visually impressive fantasy scenes, showing us the fantasy world of Walter. It's entertaining and fun to watch. The second half doesn't have much fantasy scenes anymore, instead focuses on emotional aspects of Walter. I was so touched by many scenes, including the mountain encounter and of course the grand finale - the magazine cover. I am very impressed by the plot, it tells people not to give up, venture out of their comfort zone and just do the things they are dreaming about. It's such a positive film. The only complaint is tee over the top product placement, otherwise "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is a really enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visual pleasure with real warmth at the heart of it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller makes what feels very much like a labor of love in the delightful "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty." This is a visual pleasure that is also quirky and funny with real warmth at the heart of it. Days later, I recall scenes and how well they were executed, realizing that other than an awkward Benjamin Buttons parody (mostly it just doesn't fit), this film really clicks on all levels.Stiller plays Walter Mitty, a daydreamer who "zones out" somewhat more often than the average person, most likely due to the stagnant nature of his life as a "negative asset manager" for Life magazine, which sounds like a horribly dull way of saying he develops pictures that other people take. He spends his working day in the dark basement of the Life magazine building with only his employee Hector to talk to. Lately his daydreams involve a coworker that he is smitten with, played by Kristin Wiig. But his time at the magazine is running out, as the new owners push to make the transition from print to online, thereby spelling the end of many jobs at Life. Mitty is tasked with producing the last cover photo, a "Negative 25" from a mysterious photographer (Sean Penn) whom Mitty has been handling for years, only to find that the negative has gone missing. The effort to recover this negative is the impetus for Walter to make a journey to find him, wherever that may take him. As it turns out, that journey leads him halfway across the world to an adventure that rivals his own daydreams, which begin to abate as he gets closer to the goal of finding out the secret of "negative 25." TSLWM gets where it's going, offering many rewards throughout. The skateboarding in Iceland, jumping out of a helicopter into the freezing sea off the coast of Greenland, all the while talking to his Match.com representative who is trying to spice up his otherwise bland profile?it's just a pleasure to follow him on this journey. There's something to be said for getting there the long way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A far dreaming movie and ambitious experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, I saw a premiere of TSLOWM last night and wanted to talk about it immediately with those on line with me waiting to get their cell phones back.... Didn't have many takers.... Is that a sign that this wasn't a typical Ben Stiller effort full of sophomoric humor, little guy stands up to the big guy plot? No, because those elements were there to varying degrees of success. The point that I want to make is that the movie had many ideals, humor and moments that, although not entirely surprising, were still meaningful to me. Stillers direction from Tropic Thunder was professional and TSLOWM was adventurous beyond what I expected.First note was that the audience, despite not seeming to grasp the experience, was reacting along with the movie in anticipatory laughter which was great to be a part of. Second note was the artistic approach had merits in form (its a story about a guy who works for LIFE magazine) so the form really fit. There is a bit of The Endless Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind in that form. Third note is I was more into the movie experience than I was getting sucked in by the obvious messages. In that aura American Beauty excelled where TSLOWM was stretching to get there.There is, unfortunately, Ben Stiller who starts off as Walter Mitty and ends up a version of Ben Stiller that seemed to detract from the adventure to get to that point. A lesser box office draw working with Stiller, the Director, would have given the film more air to breathe and add to the suspension of disbelief.... an opportunity missed? Absolutely not. The message is played out by Stiller making the filmas Super Ted would say, a film worth watching (more than once)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possibly the best feel good film ever made.I'm not a professional film critic, but I bet i've seen more films than a lot of them. So heres my take.The first trailer with no dialogue is what grasped me. As the later trailers came out i feared it may go down the same route as 'The Councillor'. I however still decided to attend the pre screening. Best decision of my life.This movie in every way is how a film should be made. Epic, wonderful story and i think one of the most relatable films I've ever seen.Look its not Django, or Argo or even similar and this is why I think it will be over looked as i think Hollywood has it's own ideas about what a Best Picture should be, especially at the Oscars. But it sets a new standard for Rom-com/adventure/feel good films all around the globe. I personally will put this into the best cinema experiences of my life and i doubt it will be knocked out any time soon.Just magnificent! Utterly beautiful and perfect in every way! Thank you Ben Stiller!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worse movie ever. Bollywood movie might be more fun to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot find the words to describe this so called movie. I went to watch it with my wife, expecting to have a good laugh and enjoy the movie. This is by far the worse and most ridiculous movie ever. I could easily compare the jokes to jokes seen in Bollywood movie. I have no idea where the 7.7 came from!!! Neither the spiritual insights nor the jokes always hit the mark, and sometimes one cancels out the other, giving the film a curiously neutral, blank quality I guess it s all because Ben Stiller is not only an actor in this movie but also the movie Director. I for sure not recommend it to anyone. It was a big disappointment, especially when we are all used to the funny movies of Ben stiller</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Show at the Box Office</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is more of a prediction than a classic review. Regardless of performance or cleverness during very few very fleeting, transitory moments ? this film will disappoint at the box office. Here is why. It will disappoint the viewer. Tell me where the uniqueness of this story is? Tell me how you saddle Kristen Wiig with a zero role, hiding her substantial talent behind a brick wall of nothingness. Why was Stiller cast instead of, for example, Steve Carell, who would have knocked it out of the park, even with this severely flawed role. A script that does not know what it is. A remake that does nothing to move the celebration of the original James Thurber work forward by one inch. It is basically a glorified "Join the military and see the world" one minute commercial ? without the military - but with better, more expensive visual effects. WARNING: you will never get those 114 minutes back. Throw them away at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bravo Mr Stiller, Bravo Sir. You have managed to create a thing of such utter hideousness, I may never recover to watch a movie again.I would rather stare at a turd that can't be flushed for 2 hours than suffer this total stain of a movie again. Stiller has not just 'Crossed a Line' with this 'whore fest of product placement' but rather obliterated the line while winking at the camera, carrying the flag of the latest product/brand/company who will happily throw cash at him. Lets face it, this is c**k and balls of the highest order with the once 'mildly amusing' in a "I feel quite sorry for Ben Stiller....he actually thinks he's funny" kind of way, just happy to gobble anyone who'll write him a cheque....remember fellas, more zero's, more chance I'll swallow!!! This is quite simply Hollywood at it's absolute worst. Yet another unwanted remake demonstrating the sheer laziness of the US film industry who are all too happy to let self obsessed, ego-maniacal supposed 'Stars' deliver 'their vision' of any former classic. What Stiller may as well have done is pull down his pants,'Curled one out', filmed it for 2 hours and then release that! At least then the acting would have been 'Solid'....sort of.I doubt even Ben Stiller himself has actually watched this back as we all know he would rather look at himself in the mirror whilst touching himself inappropriately.In a nutshell.....Dog S**t.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tried on two separate occasions to digest this film and I just couldn't waste another second. I got my only laugh with the elevator fight scene but then it just became silly.I can't imagine why some people call this "art" but then again it is a subjective term. Ben Stiller's character is about as dry as week old dog poo and the plot is unoriginal. He plays a hopeless schmuck who constantly escapes reality with his so called "imagination" that apparently never matured past age 7 as he tries to pick up on a woman co-worker. It has been awhile since I have been so repulsed and uninspired by a movie with a supposedly reputable cast that I shut it off thirty minutes in. You are better off watching a Mexican soap opera. At least then you can practice your Spanish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an unwatchable film sans for the 15 minutes of Iceland vistas. Horrid. At no point in the film did I feel any connection to any character. Kristen Wiig is normally hilarious and should be able to carry a film if there were any lines written for her that were interesting. Wince might have peaked in Zoolander and should definitely have not have tried to add directing to his epitaph. Better writing, better directing and more Iceland would have been the formula for this to have not been a complete failure. Did anyone see the last 15 minutes ? I did not, so maybe he pulled in all together and I missed it. Stick to buddy films with others who can carry you Ben.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should of kept it a secret!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a Big Ben Stiller fan , so was very excited to see this film. I have liked everything he's ever done. Until this! Pretty early on its established that there was confusion on what genre this film should take, comedy, drama or romance. It does them all but very poorly, it struggled to stick to a cohesive plot and finds itself struggling for direction.Stiller is great in his role and I can't fault his acting, the effects were cool and the idea was fun , but by the end I was left thinking it was stupid and frankly pointless. Bridesmaids was a great film but sooner people see Kristen Wiig can't act the better, she's funny as a back up but is so emotionless it's hard to see what the directors see in her.I wanted to stay to the end and I managed it, it's a pointless big budget flop which achieves nothing in 114 minutes. It's neither inspiring or entertaining. Comedy actors should stick to comedy films, Adam Scott who is normally hilarious was awkward, unfunny and had the worst fake beard I'd ever seen. It's clear directors are getting lazier and less imaginative but rely more on over complicating a silly film to make people confused. People need to realise confusing doesn't mean deep or intelligent, it's a film which is flawed!.A poor film, a bad end to 2013 along with walking with dinosaurs! I hope 2014 raises the bar again and puts at least 1 film which will amaze.</fullReview>

You are one character who is so fictional, yet easily live up-to be the man next door. The well paced tale of yours has the perfect combination of a story- Content, Delivery and Twist in the tale. The amazing visual, occasional vertical clipping, breathtaking scenarios clubbed with a inspiring theatricality makes your tale even more attention grabbing. There wasn't any break in the 110 minutes, it is like that of a Paulo Coelho's Alchemist, when the story makes 360 degree turn to find the treasure - 25. It's like a revelation when your life's tale reaches it's end. Must say one of a Classic.Thank you for making me laugh, thank you for those vivid imagination, thank you for taking me to places where I may never be, thank you for showing me the beauty of the world 'ungoverned', thank you for those nerve wrecking moments, as these are the laughs, imagination, beauty, moments makes our life worth living for.Finally love the message you wanted to convey.

		<shortDescription>Maybe the best Hollywood production for years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never really liked Ben Stiller. The movies I know in which he played the main characters are listed under comedy but were never funny in my opinion. Yes he always played on this fine line between tragedy and comedy but always kind of implausible. That's why I decided not to necessarily watch his latest performance. So I was very surprised by this movie. Whereas Ben Stiller was also directing I need to say that this man has a sense of taste which is quite unbelievable if you know his other movies respectively the movies he played in. Looking at the beautiful pictures in this film and the excellent music it reminds me on independent movies and not Hollywood productions. The real surprise to me was Ben Stiller in the role of Walter Mitty. On the one hand it is a very tragic character and on the other hand the scenes that should be funny are funny, all in all very solid acting and, in my opinion, more plausible than better known Hollywood actors. And that's why I give it a vote of 9 out of 10. You cannot compare the movie with the short story or the adaption from the 40s even though it is an adaption itself. Maybe it should have been titled differently. In my opinion, the movie succeeded as something autonomous. But there are some minus points as well: I think the story is nice and also believable but things happen too fast what made it less believable. Also the relationship between Walter and Todd was too superficial, I wished for more deepness or more conversations between them but I think it was a good idea. In my opinion Cheryl was needless. It would have been a better movie without the female part. But well it's still a Hollywood movie and there has to be a happy ending with a happy couple. That's my biggest point of criticism. Bottom line: I'm very glad I gave it a try, it is definitely unmissable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever take the last piece of chocolate out of the box, expect it to be awful, then are pleasantly surprised when it's delicious? You wanted caramel, but were happy to find a tasty nugget instead? That's The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.I watched the film following a re-watch of Tropic Thunder - Now let me just say, I usually detest Ben Stiller movies, but was up for a night of mindless entertainment. They don't call it Friday night for nothing'. But this was no typical veg-out movie.Walter Mitty is your basic self-conscious, insecure sucker with a penchant for daydreaming. Lucky for the viewer, those daydreams are brought to us with film-sequences reminiscent of a good superhero movie.Ben Stiller's character finds adventure, excitement, and himself on a journey to the movie's best part: Sean Penn as the uber-mystical photographer. Though it wasn't quite as uplifting as Larry Crowne, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a great film to watch if you're looking for something along the lines of The Big Year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I were a robot, I'd rate it a 6 because at the end of the film I would not perceive the feelings the film tries to convey that life is about dreaming, living and meeting each other. Before this movie, I did not know what LIFE magazine's motto was or worse they even had a motto. Just because it can be heavily related with the people of this era, Ben Stiller's TSLOWM is a marvel in itself.No doubt the cinematography, the CGI and the music are the best factors governing this adaptation into enchantment. I just loved the transition on-screen when the normality metamorphosed into wonder, dullness into extravaganza. The background, beat music aggravated my experience. Ben Stiller's countenance works fine, so does Kristen Wiig's; their chemistry seemed phony, though. Supporting cast is an apt lot.The first 10 minutes were enough to intrigue me. But later came the boring parts as to I still think why some scenes were incorporated as they had no real reason to be in there. They, matter-of-factly induced boredom. Then, towards the middle, the story goes abrupt and the main character suffers from originality and ends with a rather fine climax. The dialogs are funny and I could only realize later how the character transition is the brilliantly sketched main aspect of the whole movie.It was a visually stunning experience and I was overwhelmed by the idea of an underachiever doing wonders. The titles are brilliant and special appreciation for art department. It talks and teaches (a bit) on how to turn the tables around of a stupid, useless life. Thumbs up!Watch out for the intricacies, the implied humor, the songs (Arcade Fire &amp; Junip) and the trip down memory lane with almost all famous LIFE magazine covers over the past years flashing between the shots.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended! This is vivid cinema. And brownie points for the LIFE magazine element.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A while into the movie I was surprised to see that Sean Penn was in the cast, and for a second i wondered if he had sold-out for a quick paycheck in a lighthearted cover of Thurbur's Walter Mitty. But by then the movie seemed to have a lot of promise, so I put that thought aside and soon realized this was not your ordinary Ben Stiller movie. Stiller does a great job behind the camera, first crafting a nice, more developed story around Thurbur's Mitty character. Its an adult coming of age movie with some romance and absolutely beautiful scenery (and I mean beautiful locations). The movie's moral and personal message(s) do not come across as preachy- in deed they seem to be part of the fiber of the movie itself. I wholeheartedly recommend this little gem to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A emotional experience that will make you want to accomplish wonders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many things factors that qualifies a movie to be objectively good. At the end of the day, what you will want out of a movie is based on both expectations and what you generally expect. Some people want some kind of intellectual gratification while others look for a emotional one. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty falls into the latter as this genuine and honest movie directed and starring Ben Stiller put a smile on my face while I left the theater. Walter Mitty works at Life Magazine where he is in charge of getting negatives ready for every issue. He is a constant daydreamer that constantly escapes into different worlds to distract him from his boring life. One day, while Walter is getting ready the last negatives for the final issue of Life Magazine, Walter notices that one of the negatives are missing. Walter goes on a once in a life time trek to track down the photographer and try to find it. Ben Stiller is great as Walter as he brings a much more subtle character to the screen. He is funny in a down-to-earth kind of way and he connect with his dreams and his frustration with his uneventful life. He is not a boring person but he is a scared one, often afraid of taking chances. However, where Ben Stiller truly shines in this film is behind the camera. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and the sweeping camera and gorgeous set pieces will have your attention. The most notable scene is the long board sequence. Even though it was exciting, it also brought a sense of piece and beauty. It was surprisingly clean and felt incredibly dynamic. Really, this movie's message is directed towards those of the middle age. It inspires those who are too afraid or feel like they are losing the race against time to embrace life while they have it. After all, the world is a beautiful place, and you might as we bomb some hills as we spread our arms like the king of the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A simple plot about self-discovery developed on a tight script and surprisingly good direction. A love story without romantic kisses. An adventure without gunshots. A comedy without jokes. And what is, for me, already one of those magic scenes of movie history, to be sitting side by side with other anthological sequences like the death of Don Corleone in the first "Godfather" or the discovery of the monolith by the proto-humans in "2001: A Space Odissey": the take-off of the helicopter, the moment of epiphany of the main character (if you haven't seen the movie yet, you you'll know of what scene I am talking about when you see it). Because of "Tropic Thunder", I have to confess I underestimated the director. But this time, Ben Stiller has "really made the grade": a correct performance as an actor and an outstanding job as director. Just to the record: the Bowie song real name is "Space Oddity", not "Major Tom".</fullReview>

He is not an actor but a director. After having directed movies like Tropic Thunder or The Cable Guy this could be a life changing for him. Still keeping the humor, he gives this new comedy-drama a new spin which in my opinion should keep on future productions. Last but not least, thumbs up for the casting director.

I really didn't understand them and I told them they were to stupid to actually understand the message behind the whole story.I must say as a traveler in heart and a guy going to work everyday and missing out on something so great in your life. This movie told me what I should do. I need to follow my heart, every single day and enjoy life. Life is about taking risks and enjoying life.. its to see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other, and to feel. That is the purpose of life...Great movie... but I can understand if you're not the type of person that thinks about life in this kind off way will have a harder time to truly appreciate this movie.. but I loved every single moment...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no idea what the critics are think but, this movie is really worth watching for anyone who is a dreamer and thrives for a love affair with life. This movie is is heart warming, life affirming and doesn't take itself too seriously in the message that is is trying to send to it's audiences, a life not tried is a life not lived.As a designer/photographer, the visuals were truly stunning, if you could pause any part of the movie, it would still be picture perfect, perfectly fitting for the main protagonists career as a negative assets manager, who's job is on the line due to today's obsession for technology, it sends a very powerful yet simple message without being obvious.This movie now has a place in my heart and my mentor wrote me something once on a piece of paper which I felt really represented this movie as well as changing my perspective on life,'Don't take life to seriously, are we ever sure we are living or dreaming?'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful scenes but a somewhat incredible story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still remember the version of 1947 of this story with Danny Kaye and it is much funnier than this one. This is the story of an ordinary man who has got an ordinary job but who is a daydreamer engaging himself in extraordinary and sometimes terrible imaginary adventures in which he is a great hero. However for a certain moment on he's got a problem at work which forces him to engage in extraordinary unbelievable adventures in the real world which take him to such places as Greenland, Iceland and the Hymalaias in a short time so short that makes it also unbelievable as real. It could be accepted if it was object of his usual daydreaming. This is the weakest part of the movie. But the movie has got superb beautiful scenes and landscape visuals of those distant countries and regions which make its best part. If you are going to see this movie it will entertain you a bit anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Mitty's great escape from Old Mitty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read the short story by James Thurbur published on The New Yorker in 1939, I'm surprisingly excited in the new character of Walter Mitty in this movie. While old-Mitty of the short story seemed to keep living his daily life within his daydreams ever after, new-Mitty of the movie finished his legend by turning out to be a changed man who was ready for any adventures. The new-Mitty, starred by Ben Stiller, presents a respective spirit of the American people, a spirit proves the American will to deal with changes. I always adore American people who are responsible, courageous, and affectionately active. I adore the new Walter Mitty.A beautiful screenplay of Steve Conrad, I think about an Oscar nomination for this. Also the humorous details like the daydreams of Walter Mitty are very enjoyable, and the attractive scenes through out his journey looking for his job-partner, making a perfect Ben Stiller film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes taking a risk is all one needs to do to find ones self...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stiller and screenwriter Steve Conrad based the film, just a little bit, on the short story by James Thurber about a man prone to elaborate daydreams. He uses that story as a springboard to something altogether new, and surprisingly intimate. This is essentially a $90 million art film that maintains a nice indie sensibility to go with its moments of grand spectacle.Stiller, in one of his best performances, plays the title character, an introverted man holding down a job handling photo negatives for Life magazine. After a vivid daydream where he saves a cat from a building moments before it explodes, he wanders into Life's lobby late, and finds out the magazine will be ceasing publication and going to an online format (Incidentally, this already happened a long time ago in the real world. Life has been special-issue-only for years, and doesn't even exist as its own full website anymore.)So Walter, in the digital age, is quickly becoming an unnecessary entity at his job. To add insult to injury, he's getting harassed by Ted (a sinisterly funny Adam Scott), the super douche tasked with transitioning the magazine to an online format. Ted mocks him in front of fellow employees and throws paper clips as Walter daydreams about co-worker Cheryl (a sweetly charming Kristen Wiig) by the office coffee machine.Walter imagines epic battles with Ted involving their blasting out of the side of the office building and ultimately concrete surfing on the streets of New York City?all while battling over a Stretch Armstrong doll.Crisis looms when a negative from star photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn), the negative meant for the magazine's final cover, goes missing. Walter, with help from Cheryl, springs into action on a quest to find the negative that leads him through Greenland, Iceland, Afghanistan and the Himalayas. Along the way, he reignites former passions, like skateboarding and hiking, and those daydreams become more and more unnecessary.This movie qualifies as a nice love letter to Kristen Wiig, who represents possibly the coolest love interest on screen this past year. Her Cheryl has a nice accessibility to go along with her beauty and humor, and it's no wonder Walter has a crush. Stiller and Wiig have a genuine chemistry together, with Wiig's performance completely absent of her more zany comic tendencies.Penn is downright incredible in his one scene, of which I will give away no details. Patton Oswalt shines as an eHarmony consultant so friendly he could only be found in a movie. Shirley MacLaine is mighty convincing as Walter's mom, no easy feat considering that many of us are aware that Stiller's mom is Anne Meara.There's nothing forced in Stiller's depiction of Walter coming out of his shell, and nothing jarring about the transition. As we learn some of the reasons Walter lapsed into a life of daydreaming rather than dream fulfillment, Walter becomes a complete character rather than that fleeting representation in Thurber's story.Stiller's performance goes between subtle and extremes, with most of those extremes happening in the daydreams. In the quieter moments, it's the sort of well-modulated performance that ranks with his work in The Royal Tenenbaums and Flirting with Disaster. He's also a pretty good skateboarder (that's him riding at quite high speeds down a mountain road in Iceland).Cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh deserves major kudos for his always stunning work here, whether his lens is on Stiller in an elevator or Stiller jumping into a stormy Atlantic Ocean. Also notable is the soundtrack, with a roster of artists like David Bowie, Of Monsters and Men, and Arcade Fire that truly bolsters the viewing experience.The message that Stiller delivers with his film is an obvious one: Many of our daydreams are just a hop, skip and skateboard away from being realities. With a simple message elegantly and majestically portrayed, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty winds up being one of 2013's best movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much to Enjoy, Some Slow Spots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was more than I expected, i.e., it is not just a comedy (like so much of Stiller's stuff), it makes you think, reassess, reflect and reevaluate. It made me wonder if parts of my own life had perhaps been important to someone else even though those same experiences many times seemed humdrum and tedious to me.The photography is outstanding, the scenery breathtaking, and the music stirring. The acting is good or better, the dialogue is entertaining albeit sometimes plodding or even totally missing altogether.Parts of the plot didn't fit too well together, maybe even disjointed (yes, I know it's a farce), and for some unexplained reason the movie was occasionally slow for no real good reason, worse still it happened when there wasn't much else to even look at.Overall a pleasant way to spend two hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walter Mitty- life lesson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching the trailer for this movie I decided to go to the theater because I like adventure movies. When I came out of the theater, I realized that this movie is much more. It has everything a movie should have. First of all, it is one motivating story that shows us how to really live life, and then it is the comedy, drama, adventure... I can't remember when was the last time i watched such a great movie. This movie carries a message and a story in which every person will find themselves. I think this is by far the best movie that Ben Stiller directed. Hope to see more movies like this in the future. Acting was great and jokes were hilarious. Some quotes in this movie will also be remembered, as well as the actions of some characters. Go to the theater, enjoy this movie and remember to "Stop dreaming and Start Living".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awesome adventure powered by romance and suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was much better than I expected: I thought I was going to watch a goofy comedy but it turned out to be an uplifting story that combines adventure, fantasy, romance, suspense, and even inspiration all packed with excellent visual effects. Thoroughly enjoyable. Great work! Salute to Ben Stiller!I especially like the opening credits when Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) comes out from his drab apartment, almost drowning in the anonymous colorless city, looking for some type of life which only seems to exist in his fantasy. It pretty much sets the stage for the forthcoming adventure filled with vivid colors shot in wide angles. This film has to be watched in the cinema unless you have a huge screen TV.A tight script which essentially says it is OK to daydream because that's where our energy and motivation comes from. Ben plays the role of Walter Mitty, a middle-aged, nerdy and introvert singe man who has been managing negatives for the LIFE magazine for the past 16 years. The magazine is closing down to make way for the digital version and Walter has to look for a lost frame of negative which a long time contributor has designated for the cover of the final issue.There is lots of respect for underachievers throughout even though they might be low-keyed and seemingly unreliable, but may actually be too insecure to show their talents. Thus it is quite comforting and relieving to watch for underdogs like me (and/or you?). Ben Stiller is not a great actor but the directing is great and artistic direction very creative and stunning. The cast are great. Sean Penn is superb! His brief appearance is so powerful since the previous buildup and suspense have well paved way for it. Kristin Wiig who plays Ben's muse Cheryl Melhoff is sweet and engaging. Shirley MacLaine also has limited air time but she is strong in portraying a caring mother about to go to a nursing home. Even Todd from eHarmony (Patton Oswalt) steals the show when only his voice appears in the beginning. Totally pleasant except for the maybe too obvious commercials but it is alright since they are not available here. The motto of LIFE magazine in the movie, "To see things thousands of miles away, things hidden behind walls and within rooms, things dangerous to come to . . . to see and be amazed," could very well be OUR life motto: dare to get involved and feel. Start by watching a feel good movie like this. It will make your mind wander and wonder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm surprised by how much I ended up enjoying this film. My expectations weren't so high, but Ben Stiller did a very nice work as both director and actor here. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a movie that lifted up my spirit and dazzled me with its beautiful locations. I must say that some of the humor didn't work for me, preventing it from achieving greatness. While there are a couple of pretty funny moments, sometimes he just went too far with the goofy humor. However, you can really feel how passionate Stiller was towards this project, which had a powerful and inspirational story. I thought it was terrific seeing this ordinary man who constantly daydreams to escape from his monotonous life finally start living his dreams and embark on a journey of redemption. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is one of Stiller's finest films and was just shy of being great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Witty' and heartfelt but this Stiller is a 'Bitty' off the mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller stars and directs James Thurber's short and interesting story about a day dreamer who escapes his life through constant day- dreams composed of heroism, romance and action. Stiller has an impressive portfolio as both an actor and director but his adaption of Thurber's tale doesn't quite excel in the way it could have done.By no means is this a bad film. You really feel an empathy for Stiller's characterised take on Walter Smith - he does a fine job. But this film requires a little more meat, ambition and . The fact is - even though it is humorous in parts - it just doesn't feel like it should have been set up as a comedy. 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' is as its best in its most heartfelt moments and during an incredibly journey. The drawback from the latter is that its only brushed around the edges; its all very bland as feels like an unexplored journey rather than an explored one.Stiller is part however of a very good cast which all perform amiably. I'm not sure its really worth the time and effort to view it at the cinema however you could see far worse. My suggestion is that you buy the DVD when it arrives if its something you have an urge to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't really know what to think before seeing this movie. The trailer makes it look a very different film to what I just watched in the Cinema and that was a good thing. The trailer is fast paced and looks like a roller coaster of action, but whilst the movie moves purposefully forward throughout, it is slower and immaculately balanced . The characters and performances are flawless, as is the stunning cinematography. We didn't want the movie to end and definitely would now include Iceland in our future travel plans. My only gripe was why Picture No 25 was missing in the first place? If it was, that wasn't Walter Mitty's problem anyway. This enabled the entire story to unfold, and in fairness reality was never going to be a part of this story, but with such an emotional attachment created by such great performances by the cast, my mind could never stop asking wondering why Walter didn't just fess up at the beginning? Regardless it was a fantastic movie. Thoughtfully provocative and one of those rare cases where the trailer doesn't really do the film justice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walter Mitty is a quiet, meek little man who works at Life Magazine as a "Negative Assets Manager", the guy that receives all of the pics from the photographers and preps them for print in the magazine. Problem is, the magazine is printing their final issue, and lay-offs are coming. Second problem is, Walter spends half of his time in DEEP DAY-DREAMS, to the point where he completely spaces out and is oblivious to everything - and everyone - around him. Third problem is, the masterpiece photo slated to be the final cover shot has gone missing. He's never going to get to talk to that pretty new co-worker at this rate...Pros:- Walter Mitty is a feel-good story at it's core, with plenty of up-and- down moments that move at a pretty good pace. The 2 hour run time moves pretty quickly. - Ben Stiller pays the part well, while still sliding in a bit of his comedy shtick in. It's a nice job. - Adam Scott nails the role as the asshole executive. That's pretty much his role in every movie, for a reason. - The visuals are beautiful, and they make some clever use of the landscapes to push the story along, like having a text message appear in the side of a mountain as he's reading it from his phone...Cons:- I've got an issue with a certain plot hole. I won't spoil it, you can ask me later if you see it, but...come on, Walter... - This is more of a beef with the marketing for this movie than anything else...the commercials were calling this "The Next Forrest Gump". It's not. And it never had to be. This movie is good on it's own, but it doesn't hold up to Forrest Gump. Ben Stiller isn't in Tom Hank's league, something I'm sure Stiller himself would admit. If you go into this movie trying to make this comparison, it's going to take away from Walter Mitty's own merits. - They REALLY overshoot the value of a Stretch Armstrong.Overall, Walter Mitty is a nice, feel-good story that has a good pace to it, and a fitting pay-off for the ending. I don't know if it will live up to the hype and comparisons, but it was a nice time at the movies. 3.5 out of 5 on the BDBOS.(Hey guys, thanks for checking out my review.

		<fullReview>At one point in all of our lives, we are bound to question the direction we are taking our lives, and the decisions we've made or haven't made. Some people live extremely sheltered like, never getting witness some of the curve balls that life throws at. This is the case for Walter Mitty, a LIFE magazine employee, who has day-dreams of himself doing incredible things, being the opposite of his contained self, and living a more adventurous life then he does now.The story begins as LIFE Magazine is preparing to put out their last issue while transitioning into LIFE Online. Most people in the office will be put out of their job including Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) a worker at LIFE who is tasked with developing the negative that will be the last cover of the magazine. When Walter realizes that he has lost the photo negative by legendary photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn), Walter Mitty then sets out on a journey around the world to find Sean and the missing negative.Ben Stiller is truly doing some of his best work. Stiller's acting is sensational, truly heart-felt and honest. You feel all the emotions that he feels. The awkwardness of talking to people, and the emptiness he feels as well. There is not one scene that Stiller isn't in and he captures you and transports you into this fantastical journey. Kristen Wiig is the same way. She plays the sweet and relaxed love interest of Walter who also works at LIFE. Wiig, who we all know is hilarious, is a perfect fit for Cheryl Melhoff. Stiller and Wiig together are perfect; a great duo. Adam Scott as Walter's Boss, is irritating and funny. He makes you hate him in every scene he is in, and does a great job of being a typical sarcastic jerk. Patton Oswalt has a brief role, and adds some fun moments to the film. Sean Penn is also terrific, even though his character is mostly talked about and hardly on screen. But when his ten minute scene comes, you truly understand who he is, and the closure to the film he brings is very satisfying. Ben Stiller's directing has never been better. He takes an old story and brings to a modern situation flawlessly. Stiller and Steve Conrad (the films screenwriter), have adapted a film that the whole family can enjoy, even though it's an amazing movie for an older audience. Scenes seem natural, and the movie is very focused on Walter. The movie is always focused on what is on things that develop him as a character. It helps you to visualize what is on his mind.The cinematography is also one of the amazing parts of this film. Some of the shots that they capture are incredible, and each section of the movie is stunning. From Iceland to Greenland, even shots within the city, the directing is a huge aspect for the visuals of this film. A few scenes stand out such as some of the ones shot in Iceland, and out in the ocean. I didn't expect such a good job to be done like Ben Stiller but he really did great work.The soundtrack is great. The music fits the mood of each scene beautifully, and it lets you listen to the music, instead of it being a background noise in the movie. The songs stand out and there is a great example of this. While Mitty is about to decide whether or not he should make a huge decision to take off on his journey, the song space oddity comes in. For me this was a great song for this moment because the beginning of the song, people on the ground (in the space station) are preparing an astronaut (Major Tom) for takeoff. In the same way, Sheryll is helping to prepare Mitty for the takeoff of a real adventure, and not just one in his headThe Secret Life Of Walter Mitty is sure to win awards for directing and adapted screenplay. This is such a fun film. While theaters are riddled with boring cookie cutter action flicks, THe Secret Life of Walter Mitty stands out as a gem. Not many films without cliché action scenes and non innovative stories have done this well in a long time. I give The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty an "A"</fullReview>

And that is this films visual superiority against his previous films. Some of the shots in the movie are stunning and the emphatic soundtrack that accompanies them is awe-inspiring. It is the combination of those that make it worthwhile. Everything else is sub standard, the message it tries to convey isn't as powerful and focal as it should be.

Where this story is encouraging is how Bens character takes a chance on his feelings, digs deep to take chances. Shows that even those who we think don't have courage, are boring or don't have what it takes (whatever IT, is). And can dig deep and touch the strong human spirit and accomplish many things.

		<fullReview>Egregious product placement mars, but does not spoil, this gorgeous and uplifting film. The advertising can perhaps be somewhat excused due to what clearly must have been an expensive and risky undertaking. The film goes to some fantastic locations and could not have been seen as a surefire success.Thematically, it has shades of Office Space (1999) and Joe Versus the Volcano (1990), the downtrodden worker caught up in the office machinery, with a lighter comedic touch and delivering a more optimistic view of the worker. At the same time, there's a strong reminder ?&nbsp;Take those vacations! Notable: ?&nbsp;Ben Stiller as Mitty makes a believable and fun transformation from solid responsible officer worker to adventurer. ? The film makes great use of David Bowie's song "Space Oddity." ? It's great to see mom, as portrayed by Shirley MacLaine, as the hero many of us known her to be! While it's loosely based on the James Thurber short story "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" there's clearly an homage to Peter Matthiessen's National Book Award winning The Snow Leopard (1978)."If the snow leopard should manifest itself, then I am ready to see the snow leopard. If not, then...I am not ready to perceive it...and in the not-seeing I am content...That the snow leopard is, that it is here, that its frosty eyes watch us from the mountain?that is enough." ?

		<shortDescription>Uplifting, well-cast story of one mans path to happiness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The goal of this film is to leave the viewer with a contented feeling once its 114 minute duration draws to a close, made quite clear from the outset and throughout. What we are essentially paying to see is the journey Walter Mitty(Stiller) embarks upon to reach this satisfying conclusion.As anyone who had seen an ad for this film prior to watching will already know it's essentially a lonely planet guide to all manner of landscapes and settings. The initially bleak, claustrophobic office environments to which Walter is resigned in life are quickly left behind in favor of the wildest most extreme settings available. While his excuses for venturing to some of the more extravagant locations are often rather tangible at best, the viewer will forgive these thanks to some beautiful cinematography and a strong soundtrack running throughout.Ben Stiller forgoes his often outrageous comedic tendencies for a subtler more restrained performance. His wandering character never pains and his personal development throughout comes across as believable and enjoyable by the films end. I would say that this film isn't comparable to his earlier work (zoolander, tropic thunder) but it is certainly a great performance as a stand alone piece.while some people will claim that the story was a bit weak in places, and characters such as the overbearing new-boss are clichéd and poorly developed, I would argue these are actually necessary flaws to keep the films flow intact. There is no way a believable reason could have been concocted to travel to so many locations at such a breakneck pace for the films duration without a certain degree of directorial discretion being used. This facilitates the smooth flow of the film and leaves the viewer to focus on the enjoyable aspects without too heavy a story developing in the background.While there are flecks of romance and comedy throughout this film, it is Walter Mitty's character that is the films focus. Thrown in are some great shots and a nice soundtrack. Everything else is rather incidental in a film that as hoped leaves you feeling happy without too much emotional effort at its conclusion.

		<shortDescription>"Life is about courage and going into the unknown."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been rating movies on IMDb for years but this is only the second time I am reviewing a movie. You know a movie has hit the soft spot when you go back home, close your eyes and fall into thoughts created by it.The movie is the second big screen adaption (although not true to the original version) of the 1939 short story by James Thurber. It probably won't appeal to some but to many like me, it will be the kind that provocates thoughts about why you are where you are where you really want to be. It is about a man, that many will relate to, who is where he is because life brought him there. He is capable of being so much more who he is but is trapped in the existence that has been handed down to him. The only glimpse of his free side is trapped inside his imaginations which are revealed via his "zoning out" where he attempts to visualize the mundane events of his life into how he wishes they were. Exciting and vibrant.It is only when life gives him a chance and he shows the courage to dive in, that he experiences a flash of who he can be. And it is glorious. It is such a powerful symbol to display what every "simple" individual is capable of being, provided they dare to.A very strong factor for the convincing nature of the movie is Ben Stiller. He does a smack awesome job of being believable. He portrays the image of pure modest potential capped by the surrounding atmosphere. Ben Stiller's present age, physique and look fits into James Thurber's character seamlessly. 5 years older or younger and I doubt it would have had the same impact. The supporting characters do their job well but not well enough for me to sympathize or relate to. Jose Gonzale provides a few strong musical scores (The best being 'Step Out' that is also the prime number in the launch trailer) that set an underlying tone for the theme.Ben Stiler mentioned in one of his interviews that he had spent 1.5 years editing this $80 million movie. An effort well spent, I reckon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is beautiful. I remember watching the trailer at the movies and being curious and looking forward to watch it and it really was worth it. It's not a cliché, and it's that kind of movie where imagination makes you feel like everything is possible. After you finish watching it, you'll want to travel the world to the most exotic places and live beautiful adventures. The scenery is just breathtaking. The colors, the everything. I really loved the soundtrack, it just fits the movie scenes perfectly and it gives you the feeling that you're in the midst of a daydream. It's that kind of soundtrack I want to download on my iPod and listen to it while I go for a walk at the end of the day. I recommend this movie, it's a great movie. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet tale of living life to the full.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Zoolander and Tropic Thunder as his last couple of directorial efforts, Ben Stiller is on a red hot run behind the camera. This film is less memorable and (intentionally) not as humorous compared to those comedic gems, but with a greater dramatic depth and Stiller wearing his heart proudly on his sleeve, this Oscar-buzzing picture proves he has grown as a filmmaker. There's the occasional scene that doesn't gel - most notably an airport scuffle behind a security screen and a Benjamin Button parody - or visual flourish that feels too whimsical or forced, yet for every misstep there's a handful of entertaining sequences waiting around the corner to regain control. Swimming with a shark, skateboarding towards a volcano, traversing the Alps and saving a three-legged dog from an exploding building are just some of the noteworthy parts of Walter Mitty, although the jewel in the crown is a sensational Greenland-set musical number that sees Kristen Wiig's waif-like Cheryl inspire Mitty to jump into a helicopter piloted by a drunken buffoon. If it sounds a tad weird, that's because it is, however it's also possibly the best few minutes Stiller has ever committed to celluloid. In front of the camera Stiller demonstrates exemplary refrain as the titular protagonist - an average man who is worth rooting for - and Wiig is stellar in a downplayed role that also expands her repertoire. It doesn't quite soar like it should, but this is a sweet and solid tale of living your life to the full.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiring message in a heartwarming film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being from Iceland, where big parts of the film were filmed, I was very excited too see this film, as was the audience in the theater. I was far from disappointed.This film is not perfect, it has it flaws, and at certain points I was a bit drawn out of it and lost a little concentration. However these scenes were rare and the overall entertainment values is high.The cast does a fine job, you cannot complain over the chemistry between Stiller and Wiig. Additionally it was nice to see some fine Icelandic actors in a big Hollywood movie, and the Icelandic language added a more real touch to it.There are some great scenes, with fantastic landscapes and even I was surprised how beautiful the nature of Iceland can be. This element is successful due to brilliant camera work.The most special part of this film is the message you can take from it. What I draw from this story is that you cannot let other people hold you back, especially yourself, you should be aware of your surroundings and enjoy some of the life's greatest moments without thinking too much about it.For the right audience this film leaves something behind, which should be the aim of all films.I highly recommend this one - 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The secret life of Walter Mitty" is a perfect mixture of Action, Adventure, Comedy and Romance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing the movie, I didn't expect much. I thought this was going to be just an ordinary Hollywood - Ben Stiller Style - Comedy. But it's definitely not. "The secret life of Walter Mitty" is a perfect mixture of Action, Adventure, Comedy and Romance. Some scenes are as funny as we know it from other comedies with Ben Stiller, other scenes are very touching and emotional and not little scenes are absolutely thrilling. I really liked the ending of the movie, it was quite moving.The only thing one can criticize is that especially at the beginning of the movie it's quite difficult to tell the difference between Walter Mitty's daydreams and the reality. Fortunately you get used to it after two or three of his daydreams and don't get confused about it anymore.The actors are doing a great job, especially Ben Stiller as Walter Mitty and Kristen Wiig as Cheryl Melhoff, Walter Mitty's love. Their relationship feels very natural and they work really well together.The directing by Ben Stiller is flawless, the music is great and the camera work perfect. I'd also like to point out the outstanding editing. There are so many fascinating and well-planned match cuts, it's a pleasure to watch the movie."The secret life of Walter Mitty" is highly recommendable - you can expect 114 minutes of extreme variety and amusement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good, Updated, different version from Danny Kaye classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very good attempt by Ben Stiller that hits the right marks on most occasions. I'm not a big Stiller fan but he performed admirably here. He provided depth &amp; likability to the classic day dreamer Walter Mitty. This version was more heartwarming, a little more adventurous &amp; slightly less funny than the 1947 movie with the same title. However, there were enough chuckles. I despise Sean Penn &amp; pretty much all he stands for, including the vast majority of his movies but even I could tolerate his short role in this one. His character had a major impact throughout the film &amp; while he was much more subdued when we finally get to meet him, Penn pulled it off. You understand why he does what he does. Being a fan of the original, this version could have used 1, maybe 2 more funny day dreams from Walter. Stiller also missed out on an opportunity to give a nod to the original by having just one dream sequence with Kaye's classic "ta-pak-a-ta, ta-pak-a-ta" sound somewhere in the background. This movie is about a 7.4 or 7.5 therefore I had to go with a 7. If Stiller could have squeezed in what I came away missing, I could have easily elevated it to a 9. All in all, a strong effort. Go see it, you'll have a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For today's film goers, this is Inception but without the confusing action but it was worth the admission. A bit loose though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"My second time seeing a cinema-released film on Christmas Day since Django Unchained last year. What would you make out of life if you lived in a dream-like, lucid state of mind? Well, Ben Stiller responds to this question with this esoteric, psychedelic or hippie-influenced, and quirky remake of the 1947 film of the same name and film adaptation of James Thurber's magazine story. Ben Stiller as Walter Mitty seems like an earnest choice since his character, remembering from some clips and pre-evaluated knowledge, is not over-the-top, raunchy, or stoned as today's comedic actors would come across.Stiller evokes a sort of Truman Show-esque vibe to this character and his peculiar episodes dealing with his dreams, his love interest, and adventures through Iceland, Greenland, and the Himalayas. Mitty is done in a way, and with some of the film's choice of environment and place, like an 80s or 90s film where there the technology is there but it feels minimalist and too kind to be out-there and a bit too rough and stylised to be considerably respectable to the older generation. Given this element, I found myself laughing little in this film but being intrigued by the cinematography and oddball events that Mitty encounters more than the humour alone. The Iceland and Greenland scenes were well-done and the beginning scene (which is cleverly done comedy by being subtle) but the scenes set in the Himalayas and elsewhere felt a bit stale and overlooked.The plot does feel a bit loose too with scenes going on for quite a few minutes without any kind of intriguing traction or element of suspense and emergency which adds to the good but not always brilliant "hippie/psychedelic" label to this film (not to say, the excellent choice of David Bowie, nature shots, quotes of strength, and other pieces of music in it). It did not help that the film used the same title twice which could be an editing error in the opening credits and I honestly wish there could have been more dream sequences or ending the film like it was a dream as that concept flew over the cuckoo's nest 1/3 into the film. The possibly perceived anti-corporate, anti-TSA/pro- privacy, pro-nature, pro-culture message might be off-putting to some but it was done within the confines of exploring out of your surroundings and feeling life for what it is almost like a travel guide on Globe Trekker or a crazy episode of Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations but without the food or all-out vulgarity.One thing that intrigued me more (not just how much product placement there was which was something that didn't bother me really but it was funnily done) was the PG rating (which is more appropriately granted here than a PG-13) for this film given it has no kid appeal and features language (ass, hell, damn) and adult humour (a heroin and genitalia joke) which might scratch parents' heads more for a PG than if it was another animated work from Disney or DreamWorks. Aside from that, I probably might have missed this film if it was not for the PG curio element to a film that looks like it would be another commercial PG-13 film aimed at adults these days. As a film, it works to be a modern-day homage and it does its job and does not squirm on over-the-top elements here which add to the film's dryly comic yet ultimately dramatic presentation.It also works by allowing you feel like in a place other than somewhere else which is ultimately what Christopher Nolan's Inception did three years ago but considering how overrated and confusing I though of it, Walter Mitty (the two versions included, 1947 and 2013) was better done with the lucid concept. I watched this film during Christmas day knowing of a family relative's respect and admiration for the original and being from the new generation, I gave this title a chance and I was not disappointed as much as some of the critics have said. It was far from perfect but it was nicely done and the Iceland/Greenland scenes were worth the admission at least and the PG curiosity to it."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We were almost dissuaded by the 7.x/10 rating compared to other movies released for the holiday.

It was entertaining all the way through, and was based on some great precepts. I took my family and everyone just loved it. It wasn't a complex plot, but was quite engaging and ultimately enriching. By the end of the movie, everyone I went with was moved deeper and in a way that is rare with movies. Some magic to this one. Brilliantly executed.People who have imaginative, philosophical open attitude toward life. Truth seekers will love it. Hyper-intellectual, abstract, cynical or dry sorts might not appreciate it so much.It isn't instantly forgettable like so many movies.

		<fullReview>I don't see this as a film about finding the courage to explore the world around you, as much as a film about realizing your own self worth in everyday life. Of course, it was unbelievable and could never happen, but that's why they call it fiction. And for all of it's far reaches, it remained so humanly funny and easy to relate to. Ben Stiller is genuine in this role. It was beautiful to watch, especially for an almost 2 hour long movie. When it was over the theater was quiet and many stayed to 'keep the moment for themselves'. I don't normally watch a movie more than once, but I am looking forward to seeing this one again, soon. A great experience- loved it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im not a big fan of Ben Stiller film's normal there a bit to goofy &amp; over the top but what Ben stiller is best at is the mellow drama movie's special like this one, it was so moving &amp; beautiful made it really dose make you think about life, for a remake this film is brilliantly &amp; beautiful done. Through the movie its a little slow which was perfect for this type of film, it adds perfect to a chain of events where Walter take a leap of faith from his boaring life &amp; set of a journey of discovery &amp; adventure to track down an old school legendary photographer played brilliantly by Sean Penn.This movie isn't about narrative or script having to be perfect its about stretching the imagination &amp; this film dose it perfectly, its kind of a film for the day dreamer's that dream of a better life if your one of those people you can relate to Walter's character which make this film perfect to watch.If you are hoping to see Ben Stiller doing one of his usual humorous roles, you will be disappointed. If you want to see him capturing the emotions of a man that has a hard time expressing himself, you will love this movie, although there are a few scene you will laugh you head off at because it has that comical moments. Its one of those movies that really capture the heart of imagination &amp; the true beauty of the world while giving the message that life is about courage &amp; discovery, if you want something or you want to do something don't let life hold you back just take that leap of faith &amp; discover the world for what it is a beauty world with amazing sight's.. The soundtrack. While I was definitely distracted by the visuals and Ben Stiller's spot-on performance, the soundtrack deserves a nod as well. Every song fit perfectly with the tone of the film. There are a few scenes that stand out as particularly wonderful, special the mountain range scene &amp; the stake board scene just brilliant captures what life is all about. Kristen Wiig dose a brilliant job plays the love interest of Walter which perfectly capture the romance side of the film &amp; the very reason for Walter to take this journey to fit in her life, perfect performance from Kristen wig.The entire family can enjoy a spirited albeit superficial comedy without scatological or romantic excess. And the lesson about living the dream comes gently and believably. An enjoyable comedy this is. These very words are inspiring &amp; capture the heart of imagination with every word: "To see things thousands of miles away, things hidden behind walls and within rooms, things dangerous to come to...." Life Magazine. This is a film for the dreamer's in life, this is the film for those with a romantic heart &amp; see the world for the beauty it holds, this is one film to experience in the cinema, its very inspiring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily Stiller's Best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Living in Chiang Mai, Thailand doesn't lend itself to seeing a wide variety of English- language films. You hit the 4th floor of one of the big malls and cross your fingers... today, this ritual paid off: The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was a thoroughly enjoyable experience (wait, wasn't this the guy to subjected me to Zoolander and Starsky &amp; Hutch?). TSLWM is, at the core, about remaining engaged to life. This 2013 Mitty has little in common with it's 66-year namesake (Kaye's garish Technicolor daydreams advanced the plot line, here they're symptomatic of a 42-year old man realization he's lived disconnected to life itself). Kaye carried his daydreams into his conscious world, Stiller just checks out.-- but this isn't wrong here. Stiller's Mitty is forced to come to grips with the fear of entering middle age and having been nowhere and having practically done nothing. His most significant friend is a freelance photographer (Sean Penn) who he's never actually met--- through 16 years of contact through his work cataloging photo negatives for a dying Life Magazine. His leap into the rest of the world is amazing... taking us to parts of the world unknown to Hollywood (I could add that this is easily the best movie ever shot in Iceland)--- and it's great to see something again that leaves you smiling walking out of the theater (weird phenomenon: no one left until the lights came on! The theater was packed full of us foreigners and not one person left--- I've never seen that happen--- this could also be described as the perfect date movie for middle aged people who met on Match.com).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may be Ben Stiller's best movie ever. Walter Mitty took me on an adventure that will last longer than the approximated length of the movie. He once again works in his visual versatility that he's come so famous for employing. From straight laced, pencil pushing worker bee to cliffhanging, shark fighting daredevil. Plainly speaking, he just dazzles and he brings you in and you want the movie to last longer. The center of his dreams is of course a girl, Cheryl (Kristen Wiig), a coworker, through no fault other than his bashfulness, doesn't even know he exists. His fate changes when a negative from a roll of film from their company's lead photographer, Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) gets lost. He needs her help and she inspires him to go track Sean down.I left feeling like I just watched Stranger Than Fiction for the first time. This is a feel good story of make believe powerful enough to resonate in real life. One of the best films this year.&#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2606;For more reviews, TeesMovieRoom.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wrote this while waiting for the bus after the screening, so its kinda rough. Hope you enjoy!Walter Mitty is the kind of film that brings out the hero in us, or more precisely the adventurer in us. Walter Mitty is a shy guy who daydreams a lot, like most people, and has a crush on the pretty, quirky girl and lets his new boss bully him around. At least until one of the photo negatives hes in charge of, for the first time in the last 16 years of his job, winds up missing. So Walter, breaks out of his shell and leaves his comfort zone, to travel across the world to find his friend, the photographer, who took the picture.Its great to see Ben Stiller in a more mature drama role that still has great comedic timing by all performers. I was almost worried that we wouldn't get a complete resolution to the film but by the time the credits rolled, everything is as it should be.Simply put, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, is about the daydreamer in us all and changing the reality around us and creating the best life for ourself in the real world.</fullReview>

The acting on the part of the entire cast could not be better, and Kirsten Wiig is absolutely superb. The camera work is breathtaking, as are the scenes around the world.

		<fullReview>The only thing that I can say now is that I fell in love with this romantic Walter Mitty. When for the first time I watched the footage of this movie at CinemaCon last year, I thought that it would be a boring and not making any sense motion picture. Honestly, I even didn't have any desire and intention to go and watch the whole movie. But when the release date was getting closer, there were a lot of ads dedicated to it, many people talked about it and, finally, I changed my mind and decided to spend some of my time on this movie. And now I admit this film is incredibly amazing! Walter Mitty is so real and familiar to everyone because, I am sure about that, deep inside we all are Walter Mittys. This movie appeals to all people and personally to everyone at the same time. I guess everyone knows this situation when being children we dream about big, full of events and crazy adventures life, but when we get older, we forget about our dreams and desires, we turn into dull and boring adults who lose their interest for the life. But Walter Mitty, this shy and romantic guy, finally finds courage and breaks out of his gloomy routine and starts living the life he always wanted to live. When you watch this movie, you understand that no matter who you are and where you come from, what really matters is your dreams, your desire to live how you want to and not how others dictate you to live. The problem is that we lack this inner courage and confidence in making first step. And Walter shows us that once you do that, your life change completely. I guess this movie is both inspirational and motivational at the same time. Another aspect I would like to point out is Ben Stiller's work as a director and main character. He dealt excellently with both tasks. The way the film is done is incredible. Sometimes you really lose the touch with the reality, because you can barely distinguish where it is reality and where it is just pure imagination. Moreover, this movie is worth of watching simply because of the unbelievable landscapes. They are really beautiful. All this together make The secret life of Walter Mitty a breathtaking adventure that you live along with the main character and at the same time you feel that this is your story as well. I recommend this movie to everyone. I am sure you will also like Walter Mitty. He will prove you it is never too late to live the life you always wanted to live.</fullReview>

The film is very inspiring and it makes you want to go out and Experience the world. The Life magazine motto shown in the film sums up the message of the film well "To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer,to find each other and to feel.

		<fullReview>This movie was awkward, the geographical and cultural knowledge was horrible and Ben Stiller was awful! He has a "superpower" is daydreaming, and keeping the dream alive, could't understand what the moral, the message or where the red line trough the movie was. The best part of the movie was that my girlfriend and I was so bored we f***ed trough the half of the movie. The "silver linings" and the smart ending, WTF! How did this movie get a 7,6 average! Please don't watch this movie, if you do do not expect anything, eating dirt or watching a snowstorm gives you more life knowledge and wisdom! Not one scene or line through the whole movie made me smile laugh, after the movie i felt i gave Ben Stiller 2 hours of my life!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull, but for Iceland, Greenland &amp; Sean Penn!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It wasn't an auspicious start for The Secret Life of Walter Mitty in my life. With the screening due to start, the lights remained on and the screen remained black. For almost an hour. Then, when Ben Stiller's fifth feature as director finally started, the quality was so unbelievably, um, unwatchable (it appeared to have been bleached and mashed through a cheese grater), that approximately 95% of the attendees for the advanced screening walked out en masse. The hardcore ten or so remained, the film faltered, the lights came up, staff wandered aimlessly around the auditorium and finally, almost 90 minutes late, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was reborn.Was it worth the wait? Hmmm.It bears little resemblance it the 1947 original, starring Danny Kaye and adapted from James Thurber's short story, although modernization of such an old story is often essential. More distressingly, it lacks the magic and fun of the original.Walter Mitty (Stiller) is an anonymous worker cataloguing photographs at Life magazine and dreaming his dull life away; the scenarios that whizz around his brain being infinitely more exciting than his mundane reality. As Life prepares to publish its final print edition, Mitty clashes with his villainous new boss (Adam Scott), longs wistfully for the attention of co-worker, Cheryl (Kristen Whig) and looses one frame of a roll of film sent by legendary photojournalist Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn), prompting Mitty to improvise quickly.It's a great idea poorly realized. There are sparkles to attract the attention (the opening titles on noticeboards etc.) and occasional, smile-inducing subtle humour. But mostly The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is dull. Predictable and dull. Long, predictable and dull. Long, predictable and dull but with some beautiful scenery. The film reinforces my desire to visit both Iceland and Greenland and, yes, I want to experience many of the situations that Mitty finds himself in, in reality. Who wouldn't? That's where The Secret Life of Walter Mitty works.But mostly it's dull.When, at long last, Sean Penn wanders into the screen, or, rather, the camera finds him, the film blossoms. It evolves into an entirely different film of depth, joy and beauty. And when the camera has finished with him, guess what? It becomes dull. Lost, perhaps.There are a few 'action' sequences but they bubble along rather than flood, gush and hurl. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a film of almosts. It almost works, it almost entertains, it almost finds a funny bone? Whig does a reasonable job with a small supporting role and Stiller is a step above his Zoolander level but, scenery aside, the star worth watching is Penn. Find the DVD, fast forward to his scenes and quit once he's moved on. It won't take a genius to fill in the gaps. Like the protagonist, your imagination is almost certainly more colourful than the reality.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go travel. NOW. It's never too late.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie lays it on thick. Like a transvestite's make up thick. You get everything handed to you: a man with a boring job day dreaming his life away, having become someone he never wanted to be. A man who had dreams and 'an idea of who he wanted to be' when he was young. Inspiring quotes. Then along comes this excuse to get out of the country and off he goes, living adventures and growing into a confident, attractive man who's not afraid to speak his mind. It's not even a cliché, it's all just so damn obvious. But you know what, some people simply do need a wake up call with a sledge hammer in the face and this movie is it. If this movie does not inspire you to go out and live the sh*t out of this life, then I don't know what more you need. I don't know what the director thought when he made this movie, but from the looks of it he REALLY wanted to tell people to just go. Go out, go do what you love, grab the courage (like Ned Stark said: you can't have courage if you have no fear - or something like that), and don't wait. Don't wait for love, don't wait for a job, go live your life. Go see the world. Travel. It'll be your best decision ever.And you know what, he's right. Follow up on this movie's advice. You won't regret it.Oh, and about the last part of the movie, I loved it. LOVED it. Made my heart beat faster. Ben Stiller can be sexy. Who knew?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had mixed feelings about watching this film, but I am glad that I did. It is a truly heartwarming film, with interesting character's, a wonderful story, stunning vista's, and in places very funny. Everyone who watches this film will identify with Walters character, in either themselves or somebody that they know and it is that fact that draws you into the story. The supporting cast is good, in as much as they serve a purpose in helping the story flow, but I felt that only two or three really stand out, the rest are merely fillers.Even if you are not a Ben Stiller fan, don't let that dissuade you from watching this film and enjoying the feel good factor it provides.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its very good to see Ben Stiller direct a movie. The awkward individual that Ben Stiller usually plays is within the bounds of his comfort zone, the directing of the movie however shows that Ben Stiller has reached a point in his life where he wants to send a more serious message in his movies. The rhythm of the movie is a bit slow and dreary in the beginning but as the movie draws to an end it takes a stunningly fast pace. The whole movie is vague and confusing unless you are attentive from the beginning. The message the movie sends concerning the conflict between adventure and stagnation is very strong. Conquer your fears, don't let anyone take advantage of you. I would love to see Ben Stiller direct in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lovely film in which our beautiful country (Iceland) a manages to play itself, the Himalayas, Greenland and Afganinstan! Some wonderful characters and for once mostly laid back acting from Stiller. The last scenes gave him a warmth of character which was a pleasing advance on many of his previous performances. Apart from the crazy imagined scenes there was an easy-going pace to this film. And this was a great plug for our lovely (and adaptable) country. There was some confusion over the icebergs in what was so obviously an Icelandic village. Our Icelandic actors managed pretty convincing eccentrics, although one gets a bit tired of the inevitable drunken sailors!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walter Mitty, now this movie is quite in line with Into the Wild. Not in the essence maybe but in the structure. I always have an almost dogmatic inclination towards these kind of movies. And like Into the wild, Walter Mitty is quite refreshing and unlike Into the Wild it's more grounded and closer to the routine life. With an amazing sound track and spell binding real world imagery this one strikes a chord in the heart. The story in itself is tight and it has that innocence which is difficult to find in movies these days. It tries to get some of those funny bouts sometimes even gratuitously but that don't really dwindle the ship. It is a kind of story that I am glad was made.Ben Stiller as the director, well he does a great job at that. Puts in a very intriguing narrative. How he blends the surreal with the real is actually very good. He makes it buoyant and lively. His performance too is commendable. It's controlled and believable just as it was suppose to be. Finally, if you weigh it in your heart rather than your mind it would just have a profound effect indeed. I loved it, hope you do too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was both visually stunning and simplistically moving. If your an extrovert, you get it. if your an introvert, you probably found its metaphors boring or too simple. The movie truly inspires one to see the world. To step outside one's comfort zones, and as quoted (paraphrased), "to see the beautiful things in the world because they are mostly hidden unless you go out and experience them." Even in the most mundane scenes, Stiller finds a way to mix color, background and music to entertain. If you go into it looking for a pot of gold, you will be disappointed. This is not the type of movie trying to teach you anything because this movie is pointing out the obvious that so many people take for granted. There is a whole world out there. Before you can enjoy it with someone, you have to enjoy yourself in it.</fullReview>

Ben Stiller is fine at directing on his own, while there is a little bit draggy and not-so-funny for the first half of the film, it picks up with interesting powerful scores and musics, breathtaking scenery and several important familiar messages of life that human keeps neglecting of - do not keep dreaming but go for it, appreciating efforts of people surrounding us and sometimes, to enjoy a precious candid moment with full of your soul and mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another case of a misleading trailer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer seems to target selling this movie to the audience population that seeks brainless, silly fun. It may well have succeeded from the perspective of the box office, but it is also misleading. While not exactly profound, "Mitty" is a thoughtful piece of cinematic work, camouflaged in apparent silliness.The key plot element is a condition (it may even perhaps be termed a medical condition) of the protagonist Mitty: he would at times fall into a "daydream" (a trance, you can even call it) right I the middle of a conversation. Many in the audience with a preconceived thought that this is done only to elicit laughs may have missed an important point: this is one of the key plot-driving elements, as this condition causes him to miss a piece of very important information in a conversation (the identity of the other party withheld here to avoid spoilers). Had he not miss this piece of information, the story may have taken a different turn, although perhaps not changed in entirety.The outlandish silliness paraded in the trailer comes in two distinctly different categories. First, it's the "daydreams" and into those templates the movie makers can insert absolutely anything and it still makes perfect sense ? it's just a dream (well, a daydream if you want to be particular about it). The other thing is real-life and here we do have some pretty far-fetched situations such as jumping from a helicopter, missing the target lifeboat and ending up in the roaring sea, or skateboarding all the way down a meandering roadway in Iceland as if it was riding a bike. These are part of the plot line, somewhat ridiculous but no more so than what you would find in many other comedies. I'll skip outlining the plot here, leaving it to the reviewers' discovery during the movie.Somewhat far-fetched plot notwithstanding, "Mitty" is an underdog story and a love story. Nothing is new in the former department but the story is told with thoughtful consideration that easily has the audience rooting for our protagonist. The letter latter is refreshing in today's proliferation of smoking sex scenes five minute into a movie. With a small spoiler, let me say that the protagonists have their FIRST hand-holding scene in the LAST shot of the movie. The beauty of the movie owes much to the wonderful chemistry between Ben Stiller and Kristen Wiig. One critic describes it as "cute" and I'll buy that, although it's more than just cute. Two other roles, while both not much more than cameo, must be mentioned. Shirley MacLaine, in one of her most low-key performances you have witnessed, is heart-warming as the protagonist's mother. Sean Penn's portrayal of a somewhat unconventional photography artist (he stands On TOP OF a small plane to take shots of an erupting volcano) is riveting. Only he can make the character so believable and likable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more than just another movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For whatever reason, this is not finding its groove this holiday season. I just got back from a paid preview showing, and have to confess that I liked it - a lot. Stiller puts in some of the best work he's done (in the commercial milieu - his Indies are my favorites,and are far better than most/all of his commercial vehicles) in a long while (Tropic thunder), both behind, and in front of the camera, and is ably supported by Kristen Wiig and Patton Oswalt. There are weak links in the movie - Adam Scott being one of them, for no fault of his (capable of much, much better work) and the other being (parts of) the narrative itself. At times, I was not sure of the time this was set in (not the time as in the present or the past, but in terms of the movie's primary motif - not giving anything away yet....), and I was not sure if this was a slip on the part of the filmmakers, or if it was intended/on-purpose.The soundtrack's one of the best I've experienced, in spite of the projectionist not giving us enough time to savor the portion after the end-titles and rudely cutting us off. Stiller tries to make this much more than just the short story this one's based o; for example, he makes statements on film-vs-digital (and shoots using film stock) and also tries to capture the profundity in observing the capture of a single moment vs living in it. However, it doesn't come together very evenly, and perhaps that's what's causing all the negativity. In my perception though, that's a very good thing to have in a purportedly commercial flick, since it hits close to home on how uneven actual life on Earth is.Seriously worth a watch on the big screen (another middle finger to those pesky pirates if the movie's playing close by), though it won't make my year's top list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's So Walter Mitty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie knowing nothing about its synopsis or anything. "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" begins with a clever criticism to the social networks our lives are full of, using eharmony as an example-- albeit we all know there are examples much more impacting than that. After that, I believed the story would follow a smart way, in order to mock some aspects of today's societies. However, the movie turned to a different way; Walter Mitty has strange visions about the future-- which fail-- and travels all around the world just to find a picture to publish in a magazine's cover. That wouldn't be bad, if his trip was interesting or had any sense. I agree we have beautiful images and a strong photography direction, but there is nothing relevant to the story in his trip. Most of the traveling scenes change nothing to Walter's initial purpose, becoming very random and vague-- that's mainly why I don't give this film a better rating. On the other side, I must admit it has a pretty original story and a professional cast. In the end, it's just a regular movie that won't change anyone's life, I assure you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visual Delight, Beautiful Message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was our Christmas movie and we couldn't have chosen better. A most beautiful film with breathtaking cinematography and Ben Stiller in probably (my opinion) his best role. Stiller's performance was understated and beautifully done as a man who dreams big dreams but has yet to pursue any of them. You get an understanding, through Stiller's performance, of how life, lived one day at a time, slowly got in the way of his being who he really wanted to be.The score is such a compliment to this film and one scene in particular for me it culminates into a life affirming and luxurious moment. A scene I could watch over and over)and probably will when I grab the Blu Ray when it's released.I know that the story that Stiller tells is not the story that Thurber wrote so for 'purists' I imagine the movie might be somewhat of a disappointment. This is not the Danny Kaye movie (which I wouldn't have wanted to see, anyway). This Walter Mitty is Ben Stiller's vision and it was everything I'd hoped for and more. Humor but not slapstick. poignant but not a tear jerker (though I did have a lump in my throat several times), a love story wrapped within an even bigger love story - one where dreams can come true even if quietly and incidentally.I give this movie a 10/10. It is now on my "all time favorites" list.</fullReview>

People fail to realize that normal laws of nature do not apply to movies, especially movies like this.This movie is absolutely brilliant. Ben Stiller did a great job in directing this movie. His quick transitions between daydreams and real life work fantastically. I love movies where the setting is an intricate personality of the film. Midnight in Paris showcased Paris brilliantly, Collateral did the same for Los Angeles, and The Way did a fantastic job with Spain. This movie portrays the beauty of Iceland so vividly. Sean Penn's acting was superb.If you enjoy watching a movie with a good story and awesome cinematography, do yourself and watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ine James Thurber short story, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty runs to eight pages and a time-span of perhaps two or three hours tops during which Walter Mitty drives his wife to the hairdresser and whilst waiting to pick her up again buys a pair of overshoes and some puppy biscuits. The only location mentioned by name is Waterbury, presumably the one in Connecticut and if Walter or his unnamed wife have any combination of parents and/or siblings we are never told. During the course of the story Walter imagines he is the Commander of a navy hydroplane and guiding it through a hurricane, a surgeon who, before he can operate successfully on a millionaire patient, must first fix the 'anethsetizer' (which he does with a fountain pen), a crack shot on trial for murder, an intrepid World War One pilot, and finally, a man facing a firing squad. The sparse information supplied by Thurber clearly gives screenwriters carte blanche to do a little daydreaming themselves so here we have a Walter Mitty living with his mother and sister and employed by Life magazine where he has become enamored of a new employee in the shape of Kristen Wiig. Thurber began his story smack in the middle of Walter's first imaginary exploit, as he guides the hydroplane through the hurricane until his wife snaps his out of it by nagging that he is driving too fast. This sets Walter up as a hem-pecked husband and probably middle-aged because in ordering him to buy overshoes his wife tells him that he is no longer a young man. The point about the exploits provided by Thurber was that they were all imaginary whereas in this latest film adaptation (Danny Kaye played Mitty in 1947) Ben Stiller begins by imagining himself a hero but then moves on to do things technically possible - jumping into a helicopter as it is taking off, trekking for miles in inhospitable terrain and ultimately scaling a mountain - but highly improbable for an urban man more or less out of condition. Having said that the movie passes the time painlessly and Kristen Wiig is a vast improvement as a love-object than Virginia Mayo, who always looked like a cross between a hooker and a gangster's moll. Also, with Kaye you got music, notably his rendition of Anatole of Paris, a sophisticated number written by his wife, Sylvia Fine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dare Your Imagination To Embark On This Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***contains NO spoilers***What if you could experience your greatest, wildest adventure in your life ...without imagining it? In Walter Mitty's case, (real life) adventure seems to be passing him by while he's too busy living a life that's mundane and honestly boring. That's the theme of Ben Stiller's newest movie - The Secret Life of Walter Mitty in which he portrays the main character, Walter Mitty, who gets to experience life on the edge by taking an incredible adventure of a lifetime.Based on a short story by James Thurber, Walter Mitty (in this movie) works as a Negative Asset Manager at Life Magazine for the last 16 years yet life in reality seems to pass him by. He doesn't take risks according to his ABC philosophy - Adventurous, Brave and Creative yet he does when he "zones out" i.e. daydreams "what if" situations whenever it comes to expressing romantic feelings for his fellow co-worker, Cheryl (Kristen Wiig) or having an all out, winner takes all street brawl with the Acquisition Manager (Adam Scott) in which Walter pictures himself as the dashing hero to the amorous lover to daring adventurer and much more. However when a real life situation involving a missing photograph negative taken by a world famous photographer, Sean O'Connell (wonderfully played by Sean Penn), Walter Mitty literally dives into an adventure of his life that takes him to far corners of the world ...places and new experiences along the way - enough to fill a travel journal or two. Not even his imagination could ever think of the things he's done during his worldwide search for Sean O'Connell.SouthSide highly recommends seeing The Secret Life of Walter Mitty when it opens in theatres on Christmas Day. Ben Stiller handles the role as Walter Mitty with a little less comedic flair and more like the "everyday man" than the others in which he starred in movies like Tropic Thunder and The Little Fockers. Here, Walter Mitty portrayed like the average lonely guy looking for love on E-Harmony site ...seeking a way to validate his mundane boring life into something that he feels (at first) is unattainable because of commitments to his job and mother (portrayed by legendary screen actress Shirley MacClaine) as well as his inability to take that first step or risk. There are instances in which Walter has to either rely on wit or ingenuity during his travels discovering more about himself and the world as well as at the same time solving what Sean O'Connell sent him as Life's final cover photo.This reviewer enjoyed how Ben Stiller surrounded himself with a wonderful supporting cast of characters from Kristen Wiig as the love interest who's divorced with a son interested in skateboarding to Todd (Patton Oswalt) who somehow manages to reach Walter at the most awkward moments throughout his travels to discuss about his E-Harmony profile. Shirley MacClaine once again proves she has a funny bone while portraying Walter's mom despite her scenes being very limited she does have a way of giving Walter a clue (or two) or some sound wisdom through her humorous wit into the mystery he's trying to solve. Sean Penn as the Life photographer Sean O'Connell was the perfect actor for this role. He portrays him as the wise yet mysterious photographer who thought Walter Mitty was just a mythical employee at Life magazine just as Walter thought the same about him. Yet, when the two finally meet, that scene (with limited conversation) is defining moment of truth for Walter ...actually the entire journey it took to reach Sean Penn was. However, when Sean and Ben are together, there's something magical that not only happens to Ben's character but to all of us in the audience.Besides portraying Walter Mitty, Ben Stiller also handles the task as director of a cinematic feature for a fifth time. Unlike his previous work, Ben turns The Secret Life of Walter Mitty into a sort of visionary work of cinematic art where each scene especially when traveling the world has a breathtaking view. From the volcano erupting in Greenland to playing soccer in Afghanistan and shooting the curl down the winding road, Stiller pays close attention to each scenic detail which bursts to life for the audience ...almost like a Kodak panoramic picture with vivid colors and photographic imagery. Ben also doesn't use the "standard" New York scenery (i.e. The Plaza Hotel, Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty, Times Square, et al) either. Instead, he uses out of the ordinary places that SouthSide noted to show how mundane his life can be. Place such as a housing project complex (where Walter lives), upper New York transit line station and deep within the bowels of Life magazine where the photographers and negatives are stored. This reviewer also noted that Ben and his cinematic team carefully chosen each foreign location to give Walter as well as the audience one incredible movie journey. Plus, he creatively uses Life magazine's motto that helps motivate Walter when starting on this journey ...or Cheryl's summation of David Bowie's Space Oddity to inspire him before he leaves and while in Greenland.Overall, what an adventure you'll take when you see The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. And when it's over, be inspired to search for yours...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stiller's remake is admirable but overwhelming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY (2013) *** Ben Stiller, Kristen Wiig, Adam Scott, Kathryn Hahn, Shirley MacLaine, Sean Penn. Remake of the classic film based on James Thurber's short story about a nebbish (Stiller, who also directs) with an overactive imagination is, this time, a photographic editor for the on-the-wane LIFE Magazine, who's job is in jeopardy leads him on a globe-trotting adventure of a lifetime. Embued with humor and gravitas of an everyman's desire to break free from his doldrums Stiller gives one of his best performances with a top-notch supporting cast and impressive eye-popping cinematography by Stuart Dryburgh. While the screenplay adaptation by Steve Conrad is admirable the overwhelming use of visual effects tends to tamper down the themes a bit (i.e. the street-fighting grudge match between Stiller and jerk- off Scott feel like outtakes from the last Spider-Man flick).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I good movie to see before year ends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the first trailer of this movie I should confess I did not liked it because I though was something sort of nigh in the museum or a another comedy but then I found it was quite interesting when I saw the second trailer and today I was finally able to watch it and I was really surprised about it. The movie is full of good messages and the scenarios are amazing. This is a really good movie see before the year ends. I liked the way it was directed, the actors did a very good job and I enjoyed how the story goes and I did not find any moments that could be boring. Quotes from this movie are awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than the trailer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the secret showing at cineworld this evening, hoping it was not going to be the Walter Mitty film, but I have to say I really enjoyed it. There are some odd moments in the film but these are soon forgotten with the laughter. It was a lovely story and I'm glad I got to see it, as I would never of Gone to see it as the trailers made it look extremely boring! It has some very memorable moments and for those who have ever had a stretch arm strong it will definitely put a great big smile on your face! I would not recommend for those lucky enough to be under 18 as they will probably find it quite slow and boring places. Check it out and don't be put of by the trailer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and Inspiring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are hesitating seeing The Secret Life of Walter Mitty as I was, DEFINITELY GO SEE IT !!!!!! The film was beautiful and it had a great message. Even my kids (ages 12 and 16) thoroughly enjoyed it. It was funny, inspiring, thoughtful, intriguing, uplifting and was beautifully filmed. I thought Sean Penn and Ben Stiller were perfect as the photographer and Walter Mitty and the rest of the actors were more in the background.The visuals in this film were particularly fantastic and the soundtrack was beautifully in sync with the film.Despite what some critics say, this movie is a MUST SEE!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From imagination to reality, the empowerment movie of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller directs a master piece feel good movie in The Secret Life of Walter Mittey. Walter Mittey played by Ben Stiller captivates the audience as a normally routine individual who embarks on a spur of the moment quest taking him across the globe. One quirk though is that he tends to zone out and imagine himself interacting in dreamlike and at times hilarious sequences while in reality he appears frozen and oblivious to those around him. His love interest played by Kristen Wiig provides Mitty with the encouragement needed to break the routine and take a leap into the real world. Mitty attempts to track down photo journalist Sean O'Connell played superbly by Sean Penn in order to find the missing negative which is to be the final cover photo of the print version of Time Life Magazine. The portrayals of the events in the movie are seamlessly transitioned from one to the other not leaving anything out of the story. The cinematography was by far one of my favorite aspects of the movie. The breath taking scenes of Ice Land and the Himalaya's just to name a few. This adventure filled movie is perfect for everyone! It has adventure, romance, comedy and Patton Oswalt portraying the best EHarmony customer service representative ever! This is definitely one not to miss. It receives 5/5 stars from me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow... An amazing experience!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loved every aspect of this movie. Hope I'm wrong, but I can't imagine Ben Stiller will ever be able to top this movie. This one has everything.Very touching, very funny, very inspiring and just simply amazing. Resonated with every fiber in my being. Will watch this one a lot if I have the chance. Will maybe even revisit the theaters for this movie. Instant Classic. This is a movie that'll stay with you for a long time after seeing it.Frustrating that I saw this one before it released... Now I Have to wait for the release to be able to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thanks to the Producers of this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I am writing is not a review and I apologize for all. I haven't seen the movie yet and upon reading a story about Casey Neistat, a film maker who was given a budget of $2500 to make a promotional video about Mitty this is what he did.Instead of making a promotional video, and with the approval of 20th Century Fox, they agreed to spend all the money to buy relief goods for the victims of typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. I am a Filipino and is very thankful for the help and support of those who went out of their way and show kindness to humankind.Search Casey Neistat's Video on Youtube. Cannot post the link since IMDb does not allow long words. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Think this film is also good, but lost a little surprise. I think too it was revealed that the trailer of the film will happen. Tonight saw two films, in fact, the first one looks more ridiculous, but I feel pretty good, because the unsolved more interesting, but also because the story is true.Simply put, had a dream about but never had the people to practice, how to really walk into their dreams. This movie has a nice buckle "Stop Dreaming, Start Living" (stop daydreaming and start to experience life!). Even if we are in a dream fanciful to think of myself very great, very great, but in the eyes of others, we are just a ridiculous daydreams king.And when we come out of that step, I began to experience, the situation changed. Others daydream, we see in the world, is the sight of the facts. Travelers out of the house, is because it was remarkable. Note that I say here, is to travel rather than tourism.

		<shortDescription>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty- This Admirably Creative Attempt from Ben Stiller Results in Overstated Metaphor and Shallow Misunderstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Go confidently in the direction of your dreams, and live the life you have imagined," stated author Henry David Thoreau expressing a naturalist sentiment that bemoans the vicarious escapism of pure imagination and pleads with us to discover life through direct experience. This is the central theme that surrounds the emotionless title protagonist in the newest film adaptation of the infamous James Thurber short story The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and though it's sound advice to be sure it seems oddly displaced to be a driving refrain for the dreaming power of cinema. Within the latest remake of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty we unfortunately see director, producer, and star Ben Stiller in rather weak form despite his admirable decision to branch out creatively messily guiding Steve Conrad's overstated script to never fully articulate the true meaning of intended self-discovery. The film reeks of overt desperation attempting to fully separate itself from the original Norman Z. McLeod adaptation in utilizing state of the art pristine visuals and engulfing panoramic surrounding but inevitably loses touch with the heart of the message by embodying in the end an all too generic presentation. It might be too gracious to even suggest that Stiller knows of the influences he's admirably trying to invoke, but his The Secret Life of Walter Mitty tries to bridge the life affirming discovery of Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru with the comedic thoughtfulness of John Schlesinger's Billy Liar without ever approaching the depth of either. Stiller's fifth film as a director sees him trying to lift himself out of the conventions of his overbearing low-brow comedic past and though his impressive visuals are skillfully conceived the film's message gets lost in inflated clichés and naively mistakes living for reckless endangerment. As it is with most adaptations it's clear that this version of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty leaves behind the intention of Thurber's original story about dreaming beyond the confines of the mundane by replacing that contemplation with a theme of actual life affirming self-discovery that unfortunately falls flat due to the indiscernibility of consistent impeccable imagery, the blunt underlining of obvious metaphor, and an inability to humanly connect with our more adventurous sensibilities. If there's anything to take away from this rather uninvolving film about making the implausibility of dreams a felt reality it's that Ben Stiller in his admirable attempt to grow as a filmmaker has given us a demonstration that perhaps imagining something is actually better than seeing it become a reality.More on this review: http://wp.me/py8op-CK; Other reviews: generationfilm.net</fullReview>
