		<shortDescription>Brilliant Gothic Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently, Peter Lorre only agreed to do this film because he had been promised the lead in "Crime &amp; Punishment" afterwards if he did it. I've seen both films, and though Lorre was magnificent in both, I prefer this one. I'm so glad he agreed to do it."Mad Love" is the story of Doctor Gogol, brilliant Parisian surgeon whose reputation for doing surgeries on desperate cases free of charge is well- renowned. But Doctor Gogol is a morbid man as well, gleefully attending public beheadings and taking orgasmic delight in the Grand Guignol Theatre de Horreur, which stages realistic horror plays. The star of the Theatre is Yvonne, and Doctor Gogol is madly in love with her, hence the title of our film. But Yvonne is already married to Stephen Orlac, a famous concert pianist. Doctor Gogol, with his bald head and buggy eyes, gives her the creeps and her distaste for him is clear. However, when her husbands train crashes and his million-dollar hands are destroyed, it is Doctor Gogol she turns to. Desperate to win the love of Yvonne, Gogol agrees to do the impossible. Stephen Orlac is saved...but only Gogol knows that his hands are no longer his own. They once belonged to a killer, and they want to kill again.Lorre turns in yet another astonishing performance here; his Gogol is very convincing, quite capable of handling a few lines of cornball dialogue without seeming foolish in the least. And the sympathy he elicits is simply amazing; I found myself cheering for him the whole time instead of for Yvonne, who struck me as a cold, opportunistic gold digger, quite willing to use the Doctor if it served her purpose. I'm sure this was not the intent of the filmmakers, but Lorre emerges as the hero here, at least in my humble opinion. Toward the end of the film, he is completely unleashed, playing mad, wild music on the organ and donning a most hideous metal contraption which looks like something that H. R. Giger might have designed. This beautiful black-and-white film by MGM rivals the classic monsters of Universal, and placed Peter Lorre alongside such horror movie icons as Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff and Vincent Price. Reportedly, Lorre detested these horror film roles that made him famous, but his resentment never shows through; he threw himself into this and every role with creativity and zeal. He is truly marvelous to watch. Mad Love should not be missed by fans of old, spooky Gothic tales. It is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Freund's directorial masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The legendary Karl Freund is definitely better known for his highly innovative work as director of photography, resulting in an extensive career (spanning across 5 decades) of beautiful and pioneering cinematography. With a body of work as impressive as his (ranging from Lang's "Metropolis" to TV's classic "I Love Lucy"), it is understandable that Freund's work as a director gets so easily forgotten. The fact that he only directed 10 films in his career also plays an important factor in this, however, at least 2 of his directorial efforts easily rank among the best horror movies ever made. The first one of the two (incidentally, his first work as a director in America), 1932's "The Mummy" is really the most popular, given that it is also one of the best performances by horror icon Boris Karloff; however, it is in the second one where Freund's talents really shine, making this last movie as a director his final masterpiece.Loosely based on Maurice Renard's novel, "Les Mains d'Orlac" (literally, "The Hands of Orlac"), "Mad Love" is the story of Dr. Gogol (Peter Lorre), a brilliant surgeon deeply in love with a beautiful theater actress named Yvonne Orlac (Frances Drake). When season ends, Yvonne announces her retirement, and this prompts Gogol to finally meeting her. Unfortunately for Gogol, Yvonne tells him that she is actually married to concert pianist Stephen Orlac (Colin Clive). Saddened, Gogol leaves, but a bizarre turn of events will make him meet Yvonne one more time: Stephen has lost his hands in a terrible train accident and only Gogol's expertise will be able to save him. While he saves Stephen's hands, the operation begins to have serious side-effects, not only in Orlac, but also in Gogol.While the screenplay was written by P.J. Wolfson, John L. Balderston and the usual assortment of contributing writers, the movie is mostly the work of Guy Endore and Florence Crewe-Jones, who made the adaptation from the French novel. Endore was a regular writer for MGM at the time, and helped to write other MGM's horrors like "Mark of the Vampire", "The Raven" and "The Devil-Doll"; it is his style, mix of Gothic and pulp novel what flows through the movie, although he remains true to the essence of Renard's classic horror novel. Renard is often credited as being the "inventor" of the Mad Scientist archetype, and truly gives a great use to it in his novel; appropriately, "Mad Love" keeps this psychological drama between characters and brings it to life, spending considerable time detailing the characters and their relationships, building up the necessary tension for the grandiose finale.After directing several melodramas and comedies in a row, "Mad Love" allowed Freund to once again return to his expressionist roots and create a haunting tale of horror and madness in almost the same vein as his earlier classic, "The Mummy". Unlike what would be expected of a cinematographer, Freund dedicates as much attention to the non-visual aspects of the film as he does for the visual imagery, playing with the many different elements that form the bizarre love triangle of the film. The story itself focuses a lot in psychological themes, ranging from neurosis and hysteria, to compulsive obsession and dangerous psychosis; Freund makes great use of this themes across the movie, although it is obvious that he prefers the character of Dr. Gogol to the other protagonists of the film. Like Im-Ho-Tep the mummy, Dr. Gogol is driven by the mad love he feels for a woman, but unlike with the mummy, Freund makes sure to never fully transform Gogol into a monster, making him very human and frighteningly realist.Peter Lorre's acting is essential for this last element in Gogol's persona, and he delivers one of this most amazing performances in his career. While lesser known than his characters in "M" or in "The Maltese Falcon", Dr. Gogol is certainly an iconic Lorre character that truly showcases Lorre's versatile talent. Frances Drake is surprisingly great, showing great emotion and excellent domain of the scene, giving her best to avoid being overshadowed by Lorre in their scenes together. Colin Clive, who would become famous as Dr. Victor Frankenstein in James Whale's films, delivers a truly effective performance as Orlac, but I found that Freund seems definitely much more interested in Dr. Gogol and his antics than in the pianist's neurosis, leaving few space to Orlac's growing insanity. Still, Clive does a very good performance despite the limited screen time his character receives when compared to Gogol.It is probably this last point what truly stops this movie from being a classic of horror, as with a runtime of barely 68 minutes, it feels too short and gives the feeling that something was missing (perhaps a few more scenes with Colin Clive) in this psychological thriller. It's not really a big flaw in the end, but I truly was expecting to see the wonderful story being explored a bit more, as personally I felt it somewhat incomplete. On a different business, and as expected in a film by Karl Freund, the cinematography is simply brilliant, Chester A. Lyons and Freund's protegé, Gregg Toland (who would become a legend on his own), are in charge of it and devise one of the most beautifully looking horror of the 30s, easily on par with Freund's job for Universal.It's a shame that studios were more interested in Freund's work as a cinematographer, because "Mad Love" proves that there he truly had talent as a director too. Who knows what would Freund had directed after this movie, specially considering the great improvements in cinematography he went on devising through his long and successful career. As it is, "Mad Love" is the final statement of a master who simply wasn't allowed to make more films (although who knows, probably he wasn't interested in directing), but it is nice to see him retiring with a top notch masterpiece. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lorre's entry into classic horror filmdom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent, morbid story of a brilliant sureon's (Lorre) obsessive, fetishistic love for a Grand Guignol style actress. The early scenes are perhaps the best film evocative of actual Grand Guignol sadefests. Lorre manages to procure a perfect waxen statue of his love object, thus introducing doppleganger horror, a relatively rare treat in American horror. The main plot focuses on Lorre's attempt to implicate Drake's husband in a series of murders by convincing him that the hands he grafted for him are acting of their own will (as in "Hands of Orlac"). Many subtle moments (which critics have not credited the film for), some garishly out-of-place slapstick humor is the only negative aspect. Fantastic photography.This is Lorre's entry into classic horror stardom: Karloff has his Frankenstein monster, Lugosi has Dracula (forever, folks), Chaney Jr. has the wolfman, and Lorre's got this lesser-known but equally classic film to recommend him as one of the major horror stars of the classic era. This film represents MGM's entry into the early 30s horror film sweepstakes as well, and they did well to associate themselves with solid hands like Freund's and Lorre's. Hands..... hmmmmm unintended pun. Anyway, if anyone out there is a fan of classic horror films and has not yet seen this one, put it at the top of your list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a "lost" horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Gogol (Peter Lorre) is a brilliant surgeon who is obsessed with actress Yvonne Orlac (Francis Drake). She tells him she is leaving the stage to be a full time wife to her husband Stephen Orlac (Colin Clive), a concert pianist. Gogol is crushed. Stephen Orlac loses his hands in a train wreck.At the request of Yvonne, Orlac grafts on a new pair of hands to Stephen. Unfortunately, they happen to be the hands of Rollo, an executed murderer who loved throwing knives. It seems the hands have a life of their own--Stephen can't play the piano anymore but can throw knives accurately and he has a desire to kill. He slowly starts to go crazy. Gogol again tells Yvonne that he loves her. She rejects him and Gogol cracks. He sets out to drive Stephen mad--and drive Yvonne into his arms.The plot is silly but it still works. Anyways, the film isn't respected for its plot--it's because of Lorre and the sets. The sets in this film are huge, designed very strangely and add to the weirdness of the plot. They're all dimly lit giving the film a dark, depressing look. The acting is almost all good. Drake is just beautiful and perfect as the suffering wife. Clive is way too serious and looks horrible--sadly the man suffered from alcoholism...and it shows. Lorre is just superb as Gogol. He's very severe looking with his shaved head. You see him start out as kindly but obsessed and slowly slip into madness. Also there's a genuinely terrifying meeting Orlac has with Gogol (disguised as someone else) in a hotel. And director Karl Fruend throws in an amusing in joke--someone's repeats the "It went for a little walk" line from his "The Mummy" (1932)! The only real debit is the unnecessary "comic" relief from Ted Healy and an alcoholic landlady (sorry, but alcoholism isn't funny).This is still mostly unknown more than 60 years after its release. Why? It bombed badly when it came out, was too grim for most people and it almost never pops up on TV. That's a shame--it's one of the best horror films to come out in the 1930s. See this if you get a chance--it's only 70 minutes and it's well worth it! One of Lorre's best performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killing hands</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a forgotten film one doesn't see too often. TCM showed it recently as part of their Halloween programming and frankly, it shows clearly how Karl Freund was ahead of his times. Mr. Freund had a long career as a cinematographer; it helps he had an eye for atmosphere and detail, as proved in this film. The sets and costumes reflect the genius of the team behind the camera, led by Karl Freund. The black and white photography greatly enhances the film. There's a scene at the beginning of the movie where one can see Dr. Gogol, played with immense panache by Peter Lorre, seated in one of the boxes in the theatre. We only see half of his face, because the other half hidden in shadows. We get a sense of evil with only a minimal of lighting and gesture in the sinister figure of Dr. Gogol. The movie is a mystery suspense, not to be classified as a horror film because the gory details are kept at a minimum, but at the same time, we are shown brilliant frightening moments throughout the picture.Peter Lorre shines in this film; he carries the movie. Mr. Lorre had excellent parts in other films that followed, but in this film, as well as in "M" he showed a talent and an understanding about the person he is supposed to be. In a way, not having the good looks to be cast in other roles, he became a secondary character actor in the succeeding years.Frances Drake, as Yvonne Orlac, is awfully good. She's the object of Gogol's affections, but she loves the man that is transformed by the doctor, after a tragic accident. Colin Clive as Stephen Orlac, is quite effective as the pianist who knows a lot about knives. Ted Healy makes a funny appearance as Regan, the reporter in search of sensationalism. Sara Haden, as Marie, Dr Gogol's maid, is excellent as the maid from hell.Of course, the movie is perhaps Karl Freund's best because in 69 minutes he achieves to do a movie that is fascinating to watch because of the superb acting of Mr. Lorre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Peter!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>German actor Peter Lorre made his American film debut in "Mad Love," which I believe was an MGM release and proved to be competition for some of the popular Universal Horror films of the time. Peter Lorre had made his epic debut with 1930's "M," in which Peter amazingly played a child-killer under director Fritz Lang. Peter is a demonic performer if their ever was one, and every memorable scene in this film has Peter's lonely mad doctor character at the helm. Peter is very much in love with a stage actress who is preparing to marry a popular pianist, and all of this gets in the way of Peter's fantasy to have the woman all for himself. A train accident occurs, which leaves the pianist with little hope, but it is Peter the doctor who goes about replacing the pianist's hands with those of a dead criminal, whom Peter himself had watched the beheading of a few days before the train accident. Things take a very silly turn, when the hands somehow take over the very personality of the pianist, and Peter's mad doctor plays the innocent with the pianist, while at the time, telling his actress girlfriend that he is simply mad and that she should stay far and away from him. I would rather not mention how the story unfolds, because that would ruin the good fun for those who have yet to watch this feature, but I must admit that the ending is very funny in a sad way, and there's so much going on with Peter's sanity throughout the film. Worth seeing for a variety of different reasons, so watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-Done 1930's Style Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed "Mad Love," it moves well and is a lot of fun to watch. It's certainly the most substantial role I've seen Colin Clive in other than his immortal portrayals of Dr. Frankenstein. Peter Lorre was such a great actor, he does scene after scene as the creepy Dr. Gogol with such natural ease, it doesn't seem like he's acting at all. Yet Dr. Gogol comes across as more pathetic than evil, which is crucial to this film, which has a very simple plot and a predictable ending.Peter Lorre is great to watch! Even the most simple, corny line spoken by him rings with meaning and truthfulness, Lorre really knew how to play for/to the camera. This movie is only a little over an hour, highly recommended if you're going to do a double feature, and you're looking for a short feature as an appetizer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neurotic vs. Psychotic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is brilliant in every way. The sets are very expressionistic and therefore very cinematic. We see things according to a certain eye, and in this case the eye is demented.And the narrative. This is the most interesting work I've seen dealing with the two poles of humanity: the neurotic vs. the psychotic, or in general terms, the scientific vs. the creative / the bound vs. the free.Here we have the mad doctor (neurotic) vs. the virtuoso pianist (psychotic).The figurative psychosis of the pianist is fully brought to light by the meddlings of the neurotic, who attaches to him the hands of a literal psychotic. And this drives all else.Oh, the irony. Here we have the doctor (who is bound to his neurosis/science) enslaving the pianist (the free/creative archetype). The bound is binding the free.Watch for the Chopin. It's a cryptic reference, but just as we cut away from the radio broadcast concert, it is announced that the pianist will play a Chopin number: Waltz No. 11 in G-flat Major, I think. Of course, Chopin is the universal symbol of the psychotic, that is the psychotic (creative) pole of humanity. This underscores what the pianist represents for us. Always watch for Chopin references.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hands Have IT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This adaptation of Renard's The Hands of Orlac is quite good, yet a bit on the stagy side. It is one of Peter Lorre's early films and his first for Hollywood. Lorre is quite good, and almost sympathetic in a way, as a surgeon who has hopelessly fallen in love with the wife of a great pianist. Colin Clive of Frankenstein fame plays the musician, and Frances Drake plays his rather annoying, overacting wife. The visuals of the film are first-rate, as it was directed by great cameraman Karl Freund. Ted Healy adds some unnecessary comic relief. What I liked best about the film was the staging of the story against some beautiful expressionistic sets and Freunds expressive camerawork.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pioneers of Horror present: Mad Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perfect, amazing and fascinating...those are the 3 words I would use to describe Mad Love. And for multiple reasons this is a milestone and one of the earliest highlights in the genre. The major reason is without a doubt the performance of Peter Lorre... The story is based on "The hands of Orloc, but they could easily rename this film in "The eyes of Gogol". The couple of times he looks directly into the camera, you get cold shivers all over your body and you feel like the hair in the back of your neck rises ! I said it before and I'll say it again...No matter how impressive and realistic the modern computer effects are nowadays, they'll never give the same creepy effect as one look into the eyes of ancient horror legends like Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre !!! Lorre gives away one of the most charismatic performances I've ever seen. He manages to portray Dr. Gogol as a pathetic romanticist and a frightening scientist at the same time. An outstanding effort and you'd almost forget that there are other actors in this film... Colin Clive disappoints a bit, though. A few years after his highly memorable role as Victor Frankenstein, he stars here as Stephen Orlac. His wife is played by the gorgeous Frances Drake. I can see why Dr. Gogol worships her so much, she's absolutely beautiful...a true black and white babe ! SPOILERS AHOY !!! The story is classic and it works like none other ! Dr. Gogol is a brilliant scientist with only one weakness. His endless love towards Yvonne Orloc, a famous actress. It's a huge shock for Gogol when he finds out she's already married to the gifted piano player Stephen. When this latter person is involved in a horrible train accident, Yvonne puts all her trust in Gogol and asks him to save his damaged hands. Blinded by love, Gogol does everything to help her out and replaces her husband's hand by those of a condemned serial killer. It doesn't take long before Gogol realizes he can use this operation to tear them apart forever and win Yvonne for himself... END SPOILERS !!!Aside from the terrific performances, Mad Love has some of the greatest settings shown on the screen in that time. The theater, Gogol's lab...these are all great locations and the contribute in creating the most powerful and creepy atmosphere possible. The tension is present constantly but there still is a little room for some humor. The constantly drunk housekeeper and her parrot provide the viewers with some laughs. In case you haven't found out yet...MAD LOVE is a must see and absolute masterpiece in every point of view. Just take this quote for example: " I've conquered science !! Why can't I conquer LOVE ??" ...Amazing, isn't it ?Favorite "rewind" scene : In order to confuse Stephen Orloc and to make him think he's a murderer, Gogol pretends to be the original owner of the knife throwing hands. With a huge bandage and a powerful laugh, he scares the hell out of Stephen AND the viewers !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Lorre's bald, creepy looks as "Dr. Gogol" are memorable in this film. The story is fairly interesting with a few twists, although a bit far-fetched and a little corny in spots. Then again, it is 70 years old.The black-and-white cinematography is very good in parts. I really liked the closeups on Lorre and the shadows in the hallway. Frances Drake is a pretty woman except for those weird eyebrows, the style of the day, unfortunately.I saw this on a fair-to-poor quality tape. I imagine this looks pretty good on DVD and I'd like to see it again now that it's out on that format.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good early horror film with Peter Lorre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never read the novel THE HANDS OF ORLAC, but the story has been used so frequently that it is easy to recall it. Peter Lorre is Dr. Gogol, a brilliant surgeon who has fallen in love with a concert singer Yvonne (Frances Drake). She however falls for the concert pianist Stephen Orlac (Colin Clive), and marries him despite Gogol's attempts to woo her. Then, Orlac is in a terrible train accident that destroys his hands. Yvonne goes to Gogol and pleads for him to restore Stephen's hands. He does this by grafting the hands of Rollo (Ed Brophy), a convicted murderer (a knife thrower), after Rollo is guillotined. This seems to be the best chance for Stephen, except that he is having difficulty training the new hands to work on his piano keyboard. He also keeps finding that the hands like to play with knives. Then, after the death of a relative of Stephen's (Ian Wolfe), who was not friendly to him, Stephen begins to wonder if the hands are still under the control of the murderer, and if he is committing more killings. The final blow is a meeting at a hotel with the dead criminal - who explains that Gogol has reconnected his head!Is Stephen going insane? Or is there some rational explanation of what is happening here?MAD LOVE holds up pretty well today, mostly due to Lorre's performance as Gogol, and the support of Clive, Drake, and Brophy. Perhaps the only really bad element is Ted Healey, as a nosy reporter - his antics were meant as comic relief, but the creator of the "Three Stooges" was actually a pretty unfunny guy by himself. Moreover his part has been severely cut in the film. Probably just as well. In recent years Pauline Kael suggested that Lorre's bald appearance as Gogol was used as a model for Orson Welles' bald appearance in CITIZEN KANE (as the aging tycoon when his second marriage collapses). Welles when confronted by this suggestion said he never saw MAD LOVE, so that particular coincidence is only a coincidence. I may add that the older Kane has a mustache, whereas Gogol has none.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aside From M, Lorre's Strongest Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Gogol (Peter Lorre) becomes obsessed with Yvonne Orlac (Frances Drake), not realizing she is married. When her husband (Colin Clive) has his pianist hands crushed, Gogol must save him... but the new hands take on a life of their own! With all due respect to the other cast and crew, this is Peter Lorre's movie, through and through. He was great in "M", but really breaks through here. As Mike Mayo says, "nothing on screen tops Lorre's eggshell-smooth bald dome, and the makeup he wears toward the end." This was Lorre's first American film and he blends in flawlessly.The imagery is also great with its stark black and white, director Karl Freund's homage to German expressionism. Although also directing "The Mummy", Freund was better known as a cinematographer and occasional producer, not preferring to direct. (He was also a communist sympathizer in pre-Nazi Germany... his wife was exterminated.) The film is beautifully shot, mixing Freund's expressionism with cinematographer Gregg Toland's own skills. Toland, of course, went on to film "Citizen Kane", and many have seen the parallels between this film and that. Also, while multiple versions of this story ("The Hands of Orlac") have been filmed, both before and after "Mad Love", this is the superior film.Much has been written and much more ought to be written, but in short, "Mad Love" is the overlooked gem of 1930s horror and really deserves a wider audience with a better examination of it and those involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Brilliant Madness of Peter Lorre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Karl Freund was most frequently active as a cinematographer, but it is undeniable that his work as a director includes two of the most impressive masterpieces in 30s Horror cinema. After the incomparable milestone "The Mummy" (1932) starring Boris Karloff, Freund directed this ingenious gem, "Mad Love" of 1935, easily one of the most genuinely creepy films of its time. "Mad Love" is fascinating in all aspects - the storyline is fascinating and morbid, the Gothic atmosphere is truly uncanny, and the film is impressively filmed in eerie locations. Yet the most tantalizing aspect of this film is the brilliant performance of a true genius - the unforgettable Peter Lorre. There isn't the slightest doubt in my mind that Lorre was one of the greatest actors who ever lived, especially for sinister and demented roles, and, along with Fritz Lang's "M", "Mad Love" is probably the best proof for this. Lorre is so ingeniously creepy, so brilliantly mad in his role of Doctor Gogol here, that no other actor could possibly be imagined in the role.Doctor Gogol, a brilliant surgeon is dedicated to helping people. The Doctor, who is active in Paris, is also obsessed with the beautiful actress Yvonne (Frances Drake), whom he goes to watch every night in macabre shows at the "Théatre Des Horreurs" (arguably an allusion to the "Théâtre du Grand-Guignol" , which was specialized on Horror shows). Gogol, who is madly in love with Yvonne, is devastated when he learns that she is actually married to the famous pianist Stephen Orlac (Colin Clive). Yet he decides to help, when Orlac's hands are destroyed in a train crash. After Gogol replaces the pianist's hands with those of a knife-throwing killer, the new hands reveal unforeseen desires in Orlac. At the same time, Gogol is becoming more and more insane over being rejected by Yvonne...As mentioned above, director Karl Freund was mainly active as a cinematographer. It is interesting to see how cinematographers in Horror cinema have often become directors with a particularly awe-inspiring grasp for atmosphere. A later Horror genius, the Italian master Mario Bava (my personal choice for THE greatest Horror-director of all-time), would also start out as a cinematographer and became the supreme master of Gothic atmosphere. This is also the case with Karl Freund. The man is only credited as the director of ten films (eleven, if counted as a co-director of Tod Browning's 1931 classic "Dracula"), whereas he was the cinematographer for over 130 films. His great talent for eerie visual style and uncanny Gothic atmosphere shows both in his celebrated "The Mummy" and in this less-known gem. Freund's talent for atmosphere goes perfectly in hand with the acting genius of Peter Lorre. Lorre is incomparably creepy in this film, and Freund's cinematographic talent even increases this impression. At some points in the film, Lorre stares at the camera with a look on his face that is pure madness. These moments are incomparably creepy, and even more intense due to Freund's ingenious sense for lighting. None other than the great Colin Clive, most famous for his role of the eponymous Baron in James Whale's classic "Frankenstein" (1932) and the even superior sequel "Bride of Frankenstein" (1935) shines in the role of Gogol's patient/victim Orlac. Frances Drake is great and incredibly beautiful in the female lead - who could blame Gogol for falling for her? Miss Drake was primarily known as a pinup girl in World War 2, but she was also a good actress. The dialogue (or, more precisely, Peter Lorre's monologue) includes some of the greatest lines ever in Horror cinema. I am aware of getting repetitive by now, but I simply could go on praising Lorre's performance forever. His performance in this film is, simply put, one of the most outstanding performances ever in a Horror film, and is is beyond me why this film isn't as well-known as other contemporary Horror classics. "Mad Love" is a fascinating, breathtaking and incredibly creepy film that once again proves the brilliance of Karl Freund as a director, and even more so the brilliance of Peter Lorre as an actor. An absolute must-see for every Horror fan and cinema-lover! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Screen legend Peter Lorre makes a grand American debut in the starring role of this solid shocker, a rare contribution by MGM to the horror film cycle of the 1930s. He's utterly off his rocker, yet not completely unsympathetic in a story that's just one of many adaptations of "The Hands of Orlac" to be filmed over the years.Colin Clive of "Frankenstein" fame plays Stephen Orlac, a renowned concert pianist whose hands are crushed in a horrible train accident. What's a piano player to do without his hands? Stephens' wife Yvonne (beautiful Frances Drake) approaches eminent surgeon Dr. Gogol (Lorre) to work his magic. Well, what Gogol does is take the hands of a recently executed murderer (Edward Brophy) and attach them to Stephen's arms. Soon Stephens' hands seem to be acting on their own and developing a flair for throwing knives. This is perfect for Gogol, who now sees a way to worm his way into the life of Yvonne, an actress in Grand Guignol productions whom he's lusted after for a long time.Lorre is fantastic in the role of the demented Gogol. He's a delight to watch, especially in one memorable sequence where Gogol, in disguise, is attempting to influence Stephens' fragile mind. Gogol is a pretty twisted guy; not only does he get turned on by the atrocities in Yvonnes' plays, but he's a regular attendee at public executions. The rest of the cast is fine, with Clive in a slightly more restrained performance than the one he gave as Henry Frankenstein. It's nice to see Keye Luke in a small role, but the comedy relief by co-stars Ted Healy (as a stereotypically pushy reporter) and May Beatty (as Gogols' maid) is just too much. Talented cameraman and cinematographer Karl Freund ("The Mummy"), in what was unfortunately his last directorial credit, guides the whole thing with admirable style. Here he does a great job of showing us just why the concept of this story has endured for so long.Any fan of the studio genre pictures from this period is advised to seek out "Mad Love". It's good macabre fun - well paced, well shot, and well edited, and an impressive showcase for a very distinctive actor.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wacko Lorre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lorre is wacko and goes over the top in this one- but he is never less than brilliant. He obviously prepared and planned for this role and his craftsmanship is apparent.The subject matter about the hands is pretty creepy, but there is one scene in particular when Gogol appears as a "reconstructed" dead man that is as creepy as it gets and it still holds up today.Gogol's progression from sadist to flat out lunatic is the basis of the film and it displays some weird psychology along the way.A strong performance is delivered by the lead actress and it contrasts well with Lorre's strong character.This is one crazy 1930's horror film and is not to be missed. There is even a sadistic cockatoo that makes the proceedings crazier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cinematographer Karl Freund (he shot "Dracula," having directed "The Mummy" a few years earlier), was called in to direct his countryman Lorre in this marvelous example of 30s horror. There's a more relaxed sense to this one, as if he's feeling more comfortable in the job - or perhaps just more comfortable working in English. The story comes from "The Hands of Orloc," and is an oft re-told tale of a pianist who loses his hands in an accident, only to have a brilliant scientist replace them with those of a murderer. Of course, he comes to believe his hands are urging him to kill, but it's the mad doctor obsessed with the wife of the pianist who's really to blame. I had forgotten that Colin Clive of "Frankenstein" played the pianist, and there are certain touches that make me wonder if his friend James Whale might have turned up on the set to help out here and there. Freund keeps his odd angles and other expressionistic elements, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Lorre's chilling performance as a serial child murderer in Fritz Lang's 'M (1931)' brought him much acclaim both in Germany and internationally, though it took a few years to escape being typecast as a crazy, tormented villain. His first English-language film, after fleeing Nazi Germany in 1933, was Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934)'; though Lorre memorised all his dialogue phonetically, it was this sinister performance that first brought the actor to my attention. 'Mad Love (1935)' was his first film in Hollywood, directed by fellow European Karl Freund, who is best known as a cinematographer from the silent era of German Expressionism. Freund, however, also has a few other notable directorial credits to his name, mainly in the Universal horror genre. He directed Boris Karloff in 'The Mummy (1932)' and performed some uncredited work with Tod Browning for 'Dracula (1931).' 'Mad Love' combines Freund's sensibilities as a visual artist with strong acting and succinct storytelling, to produce what is certainly one of the finer horror films of the 1930s.Doctor Gogol (Lorre), a respected if unconventional surgeon working in Paris, visits nightly shows featuring his favourite actress, Yvonne Orlac (Frances Drake). But when Yvonne plans to abandon show-business in favour of a honeymoon with her pianist husband Stephen (Colin Clive), Gogol's unhealthy infatuation ? initially just hopeless and pitiable? transforms into something even more menacing. A train-wreck leaves Stephen with crushed hands, and Gogol decides to substitute the useless appendages with those of an executed knife-throwing murderer (Edward Brophy). In a welcome break from the genre norm, the supporting performances are actually quite strong, with the exception of the grating alcoholic maidservant (played by May Beatty). Peter Lorre's performance is a piece of goggle-eyed brilliance, and rightly earned the actor accolades in America, even if the film faired poorly at the box-office. Gogol is initially a pitiable object of misguided passion and lust, and Lorre brings a tinge of sadness to those huge, pathetic eyes of his. However, by the film's end, his character becomes genuinely frightening, a deranged and maniacal mad-man.Doctor Gogol likens himself to the mythical Cypriot sculptor Pygmalion, who falls in love with a beautiful feminine statue, which is brought to life by Aphrodite for him to marry. Just like Pygmalion, Gogol bestows gifts upon a realistic wax sculpture of Yvonne Orlac, in the futile hope that it will come to life. When this seemingly happens, the sculpture rejects his embrace; he is betrayed by a being that he considers his own, having ostensibly brought her into existence. The themes of the film also occasionally echo those previously explored in James Whale's 'Frankenstein (1931).' By patching together body parts (in this case, hands) to reconstruct a complete human, Gogol creates a monster ? though, as with Doctor Frankenstein, the creator could more accurately be described as the story's monster. In any case, the film ends with the destruction of the scientist/creator, literally at the hands of his creation. Occasionally silly, but endearingly so, 'Mad Love' is a fine addition to 1930s horror, and an excellent Hollywood debut for one of its greatest character actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant surgeon Dr. Gogol is infatuated with Horror Theatre star Yvonne Orlac. After meeting her in person and realising that she only has eyes for her husband, the renowned pianist Stephen Orlac, he buys a life size mannequin of her and dreams of doing what Pygmalion did with Galatea. When Stephen is involved in an horrific train crash and has both his hands crushed beyond healing, Yvonne pleads with Gogol to help save his well being, he does, by amputating the crushed hands and grafting on the hands of a recently executed murderer, a murderer who's speciality was knives!Mad Love is one of those amazingly old classics that is a hybrid of genre staples, at times it's surrealist and at others its enjoying its Grand Guginol pulse, whilst knowingly it's lacing its story with an uneasy comedic beat. Boasting camera work from Gregg Toland and Chester Lyons and directed by the impressive Karl Freund, this adaptation of Maurice Renard's novel is a chillingly memorable piece of work. Working off a plot that sees the bad Doctor driven by lustations rather than out and out insanity, Freund revels in slowly winding the coil until the spring that is Peter Lorre (Gogol) explodes (implodes), cloaking various scenes in telling shadows that themselves become integral to the plot. Peter Lorre is of course in his element, demented yet sympathetic, it's real hard to take your eyes away from his magnetic weirdness. Colin Clive as Stephen Orlac also puts in a performance of note, all twitchy nervousness and believable emotional torment, whilst Frances Drake more than adequately brings vulnerability to the centrifugal importance of Yvonne's emotional turmoil.Weird and gorgeous, and incredibly well written, Mad Love holds up incredibly well today as a horror/romance film of vast influential worth, see it in the dark and marvel at its various moments of excellence. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lorre's master work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More subtle than its plot line might suggest?a brilliant scientist, Dr. Gogol (Peter Lorre) obsessed with Yvonne. a beautiful actress (Frances Drake), and is distressed by her plans to leave the theatre where he has been in attendance every night. He manages to purchase a wax statue of her from the closing show, and calls her Galatea. Later Gogol has the opportunity to help her by operating the hands of her pianist husband Stephen Orlac (Colin Clive) injured in a train wreck. Gogol transplants the hands of a recently executed knife-throwing killer Rollo (Edward Brophy). Eventually the hands prove more skilled at knife-throwing than piano-playing. Gogol, growing steadily more and more deranged, brilliantly disguises himself as Rollo with his head reattached and prosthetic hands, and convinces Orlac he's killed his stepfather, a crime he committed himself to drive Orlac mad. It almost works, but the fingerprints on the knife match the executed killers, as do those on Orlac's hands. Reagan, an American reporter (Ted Healy) makes the connection with Gogol, and the police and everybody rush off just in time to save Yvonne from being strangled: Gogol has heard a voice telling him that every man kills the thing he loves. Orlac throws a knife through an opening in the locked door and Gogol dies. A good deal of effort has been made to render this movie even more Gothic, especially the play in which Yvonne performs: we see only one brief scene, in which she is strapped to a rack and tortured. Ever shot is shadowed and angled in the best expressionist/horror tradition, and much of the action occurs at night. Lorre's head is shaved and his odd looks exaggerated. There's comic relief in Gogol's frowsy old housekeeper (May Beatty), who drinks a great deal and walks around with a white cockatoo on her shoulder. Some of the acting is surprising good, especially Clive as the noble artist damaged by a cruel fate. Drake is lovely but she delivers her lines too theatrically. The Americans indicate their Americanness by talking briskly in New York accents while chewing gum. Lorre himself is marvelous. He transforms his part into a near tragedy, the story of an unattractive man whose great achievements bring him no closer to the love he needs. Lorre's face registers hurt and longing and resignation, and he is convincing as a kind and altruistic man in his work, exemplified by his manner with a little girl whose ability to walk he restores. He treats his colleague Dr. Wong (Keye Luke) with respect. It's only in this one part of his life that disappointment, and then madness, comes. The balance of sympathy and revulsion shifts. It's bound to end in tears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, like many true classics of the 1930s, seems destined never to appear on DVD. It would be a crying shame if this film was denied DVD treatment, especially considering the fact that virtually any old tripe made in colour often gets two or three separate DVD releases.Peter Lorre gives a masterful and scene-stealing performance as a brilliant surgeon called on, by the woman he is fatefully obsessed by, to perform surgery on her husband. The film is beautiful to watch, not only for a simple tale of horror well told, but for the sheer fun of it. This is one of those movies (along with Dracula, Frankenstein, and perhaps even The Hounds of Zaroff) that defined the classic period of American horror films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unsung classic! Great atmosphere and fine Lorre performance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mad Love" is not nearly as well known as other '30s horror classics, but certainly deserves to be! The director, Karl Freund, was one of early cinema's most innovative cinematographers, having worked with F. W. Murnau, James Whale, and others on such gems as "Frankenstein" and "The Last Laugh." The film presents Frances Drake as one of the most emotionally strong female characters to be featured in a '30s flick. Lorre gives one of his creepiest perfomances... it's great, high camp. Colin Clive (Dr. Henry Frankenstein himself!) lends strong support and the comic relief (annoying to some, not to me) is supplied by vaudeville great Ted Healy, the man who brought the Three Stooges together as his second bananas before they went solo. But the star of the show is Freund's direction - this is one of the most eerie, atmospheric films ever made. Sure, it's a bit over the top, but what '30s and '40s horror film isn't? A classic! Do yourself a favor and check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unusual Horror Film for the 30s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank the gods for the internet, huh? In this modern age, internet communities and online reviews give us a chance to discover films that would otherwise go well below our radar. It is was the case that I found this movie to be highly recommended by several sources and it did not disappoint.I have been a monster kid since I was a young one in the 70s and read every horror movie history book I could get my hands on, but this movie never seemed to pop up in those mentions. Part of that is no doubt due to its' oddity among its' 30s brethren. This is a not a "monster movie" as was so popular during those days. Instead it predates the more thriller oriented horror of the 40s that would come later on, focusing instead on a deranged and slightly maniacal doctor longing for a love that he cannot have. Doing a little research on the movie, I also find that critics were not kind to it during its' day, but have come around in the past few decades, probably another reason that it is more mentioned now than it was during its' time.That seems to be a surprise because the movie is a horror fiend's dream. Based on a novel that had already been filmed as THE HANDS OF ORLAC with CALIGARI's Conrad Veidt. Directed by legendary cinematographer Karl Freund, with a script from Guy Endore, whose novel THE WEREWOLF OF Paris was a heralded classic made into the Hammer film CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF. The cast features the wonderful Peter Lorre in his first American role, along with Doc Frankenstein himself, Colin Clive. All of these parts together were almost certain to yield something worthwhile.The beginning of the movie sets a dark tone right from the start. Using the Grand Guignol stage as its' backdrop, we are immersed in a world of chills, as each employee of the theatre is dressed in spooky costume, before our heroine takes the stage in a production that would make Mario Bava proud. From there, we go to a beheading, complete with shiny, sharp guillotine and gallows humor. While there are no fantastic monsters present (as in Universal's work of the time), there are certainly chills to mark this firmly in horror territory.The story strays from the plot of the earlier HANDS OF ORLAC by placing much more emphasis on the new character of Dr. Gogol, played by Lorre. He's the glue holding this movie together, as he displays impressive range. We know from the beginning that there's something a little off about him. Clearly, he's obsessed with the heroine and maybe a little too much with torture, beheadings and deathly theater. In an early scene, we see that he's a little bit socially backwards as he takes an opportunity for a peck on the cheek with our heroine as a chance to plant a deep kiss on her.From there, his obsession spirals out of control, just as much as his grip on sanity seems to be spiraling downwards. His plot to make Yvonne his own ultimately ends with a dastardly surgery and murderous plot. By the time he comes to dress as a dead serial killer to further his ruse with Orlac, it's clear that he's crossed from damaged goods to full- on maniacal villain.The directing of Freund is spot on, as always. His movies look incredible and this is no exception. Watch the early conversation between Gogol and Yvonne in her dressing room and the use of close ups for a director clearly in firm grasp of his craft. The movie would work almost as effectively on mute as it does with sound.I recommend this to any fan of early horror or thrillers. What it may lack in a memorable monster, it more than makes up for by presenting a good story with great characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gem in the treasure chest of the golden age of horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Dracula' and 'Frankenstein' paved the way for films to go a little further into the realms of the macabre. 'Mad Love' is the child of those films in that it represents the utmost pinnacle of how far the grotesque could be taken before a conservative 30's society would say enough is enough. It is a very grim film with the blackest of humor. Like 'Dracula' and Lugosi and 'Frankenstein' and Karloff, this is the film that cemented Peter Lorre as a master of the macabre. And like those films the casting of our title monster is so quintessential.Lorre is a whole different kind of animal. He has none of the gentlemanly qualities of a Lugosi or a Karloff. You take one look at his thick bulging eyes and you want to scream pervert. While the whole concept of rape is pretty explicit in 'Dracula', there is an almost bizarrely romantic quality to the vampiric predatory lust. Lorre and his Dr.Gogol leave nothing to interpretation. What is so amazing about his performance here is how Lorre seemingly keeps this character grounded in the concept of heartbreak. I don't know if I'd call his performance or character similar to the Lon Chaney films but I do once again notice the idea of rejection leading to madness. With a title like 'Mad Love' you expect extremities and to be fair there are but they do not come from Lorre's performance. The whole subplot with the "Hands of Orlac" is not what draws one into the film and I think with not much finagling you could almost underplay the story entirely. This entire story is about a descent into madness and sexual lust. You cannot take Lorre's natural oddness and quirks at face value at the beginning of the film because by the end he becomes a beast.Karl Freund in his last horror film shows why he is rightly considered a legend of the genre. The most striking thing about Mad Love are it's macabre visuals. Like Lugosi or Karloff in 'Dracula' and 'The Mummy' Freund knows just how to film his menace. The camera has never had a more 'mad' love affection than it has with Lorre. One of the most frightening and weird visuals ever put on film is Freund's slow reveal of Lorre masquerading as the dead killer Rollo. We as an audience know it is a conceit and yet just the thrill of the scene and the build up is incredible. Cinematographer Gregg Toland went on to helm 'Citizen Kane' and one can see the DNA here.Aside from Lorre and Freund though this film has a great cast. Our old friend Colin Clive is back as the tortured Stephen Orlac who finds himself the guinea pig for this horrific experiment. I find it hard seeing Clive in anything but 'Frankenstein' but he is good and is versatile. While Henry Frankenstein embraced his insanity Orlac tries desperately to keep his. He's wonderful in the film. Even more deserving of praise though is Frances Drake as Yvonne Orlac. Yvonne is a quintessential role in making this film work. Since Lorre is so ruthless in his lust Drake has to be strong enough to stand up to Lorre. She does. In a genre where the female roles were often victims this is a stand out role and performance. We genuinely fear for Drake. The last exchange between the doctor and the object of his affection is outstandingly tense.'Mad Love' is a fine piece of horror. In many ways it was ahead of it's time in it's grim subject matter. The fan of the golden age of horror films will find an example of the genre at it's peak with characters and performances that exhibit the best of macabre movie magic</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant surgeon Dr. Gogol (Peter Lorre) is in love with actress Yvonne Orlac (Frances Drake). Yvonne is married to pianist Stephen Orlac (Colin Clive). When Stephen's hands are crushed in a train accident, Yvonne turns to Dr. Gogol to save them. Gogol performs a hand transplant, giving Stephen the hands of recently executed knife-thrower Rollo (Edward Brophy). Over time it becomes apparent Stephen's ability to play the piano is gone but now, whenever he's angry, he finds he has a knife-throwing ability he never had before.I believe this is the first sound adaptation of the Hands of Orlac story. It's certainly the best version of that story I've seen on film. It's an often copied story, usually without credit. Every movie you've seen that features a transplanted body part that belonged to a murderer is derivative of The Hands of Orlac. Variations of it are still being made today. But none has surpassed this one. This is one of the best horror movies of the 1930s and, surprisingly, it wasn't made by Universal. Peter Lorre is superb as the obsessive insane Gogol. Colin Clive and Frances Drake are both good, though more typical performances of the genre than the extraordinary performance of Lorre. Edward Brophy is great fun in his brief screen time as Rollo. Much is made of Ted Healey's unwanted comic relief as a nosy reporter but I don't feel he intrudes on the story much so it didn't bother me. Director Karl Freund does an amazing job, just as he did when he directed The Mummy. Freund was better known as a cinematographer. He shot such legendary films as Metropolis, Dracula, and The Good Earth. He had a wonderful eye and all of the films he worked on looked great.. This would be the last film Freund directed before returning full-time to cinematography. Check this one out if you haven't already. Mad Love is a must-see for classic horror fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lorre Showcase</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With his bald head, pudgy diminutive figure and buggy eyes, Lorre's Dr. Gogol resembles a troll from heck. So, with those looks, how does he think he's going to win the affection of the beauteous Yvonne (Drake). Besides he can't really decide whether it's the live Yvonne or her wax figure that attracts him most. After all the character's adapted from the Greek myth of a statue that springs to life because of a man's yearning. Here I've got to hand it to Drake who manages to stand stock still while impersonating the statue, no mean trick.Anyhow, Lorre manages to look scary, but still be sympathetic, since he devotes his physician's skills to healing injured kids just for the humanity of it. But he's got this weird obsession with Yvonne after seeing her in one of those old style gory stage shows. Besides she's already got a husband who plays beautiful music, unlike the poor ill-formed Gogol. Still that's no problem for a guy who can not only help kids, but also transplant heads and hands when needed. After all, this is Peter Lorre, not Robert Taylor. So watch out Mr. Yvonne (Clive), that obsession is all-consuming.Having seen the movie years ago with all its nightmarish light and shadow, I chuckle every time director Freund's name comes up as a regular crew member in the old slapstick series, I Love Lucy. It's hard to conceive of two more contrasting formats, yet he appeared to excel at both. Anyway, the movie's an effective horror piece thanks mainly to Lorre and Freund. My only reservations are Clive who looks too dissipated to be either a desirable husband or a concert pianist, while the knife-throwing gimmick seems too impersonal to be scary. I'd have preferred the hands of maybe a more "ripper" type psychopath. All in all, the movie's a Lorre showcase, proving you don't have to have glamour-boy type looks to carry a movie impressively.</fullReview>

When Clive encounters a condemned murderer (Edward Brophy) on a train, he has no idea of how their lives (and certain body parts) will cross thanks to the creepy Lorre.In addition to "Phantom", this also has connections to "The Mystery of the Wax Museum" (and its remake, "House of Wax"), and in particular, Lorre's later "The Beast With Five Fingers", not to mention the Boris Karloff Z-grade chiller "The Ape" in reference to Lorre's child patient. Lorre is one of those gentle mad men, kind with his young lame patient, but determined to win Drake even if it is through death. Ted Healy plays an American reporter in Paris, and Andy Hardy's Aunt Millie (Sara Haden) is Drake's devoted companion. May Beatty, as Lorre's drunken housekeeper, has a truly spooky shadowy scene featuring a white cockatoo resting on her shoulder. There have been other versions of "The Hands of Orlac", but this one is probably the best known and certainly the most memorable.</fullReview>

Later, Mr. Lorre is consumed with orgasmic desire as he watches the real Ms. Drake perform on stage as a tortured victim. Backstage, the actress is flattered by the renown surgeon's admiration. But, Lorre is devastated to learn Drake will be leaving for England with pianist husband Colin Clive (as Stephen Orlac).En route, Mr. Clive's hands are wounded in a train wreck. Called in to operate, Lorre decides to amputate Clive's hands and sew on the hands of a recently decapitated murderer. Poor Clive loses his piano-playing ability, but gains other talents? The whole "hand transplant" machinations never grabbed me or aided in my suspension of disbelief; but "Mad Love" is stylish, has Karl Freund directing, and Lorre is an amazing sight for sore eyes. Also watch for the Yvonne's maid Sara Haden (as Marie), who can really hold her own.******* Mad Love (7/12/35) Karl Freund ~ Peter Lorre, Frances Drake, Colin Clive, Ted Healy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very vivid and disturbing story about an obsessive love that drives a brilliant surgeon to madness. Although based on a novel called "The Hands of Orlach", Orlach takes a backseat once Peter Lorre is cast for a new character, Dr. Gogol, created for the movie. Lorre becomes the main focus and thus why the picture is renamed to "Mad Love" since it is more about this mad obsessive love and the transplanted hands are more of a sub-plot.Lorre is excellent in this portrayal. I can't imagine anyone else playing this role with more disturbing results. He is beyond creepy, but does not overact it. He is at times quite sensitive and loving when dealing with his child patients. And then very maniacal as he descends to madness. His portrayal of Rollo is quite menacing. Of course, to today's standards, this is a very tame "horror" picture. But I very much prefer it that way - compared to the overly graphic guts and gore of today's horror films, which I won't see.I think there is much more left to the imagination, which at times can be just as frightening, without having to include the flagrant violence.The film runs short - it was only 68 minutes. The cinematography is amazing, in part due to the Director Karl Freund who was also a great cinematographer in his own right (he later won 1938 Oscar for Cinematography for "The Good Earth). This is his last film as director as he returns exclusively to cinematography (eventually becoming chief cinematographer for the "I Love Lucy Show"). There is great use of shadows and angles, owing to the influence of German Impressionistic cinema which Freund was well versed. I was amazed at the sharp, clean images and lack of scratches on the TCM version I saw. Very impressive clarity for a film that is over 70 years old.I found the ending to be a little too pat in the resolution, but apart from that, this definitely deserves the designation as a classic horror film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mad about Lorre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a film that takes place in a Paris which still executed criminals with the guillotine (which they did publicly until 1939), and where entertainment included the Grand-Guignol theatre (open until 1962), where murder and mayhem were an every night occurrence.Our heroine is the lead actress at the "Theatre des Horreurs" (a thinly-veiled reference to the Grand Guignol in Montmartre), where every night the creepy Dr. Gogol (Lorre) sneaks in to watch her be tortured on stage. (The real actress at the G-G was called "the most assassinated woman in the world" and was killed over 10,000 times in 60+ ways.) Gogol's obsession leads him to get involved in her private life, when her pianist husband loses his hands in a railway accident.Lorre is magnificent in this role. Every expression, every word, gives insight into his malevolent and psychotic character. His shaved head, and his weird "Rollo" costume, only add to the sense of dread every time he's on screen. And of course, like all horror villains, he has a pipe organ in his house, which he plays for his wax mistress. He is by far the most nuanced performer among the horror stars of the 1930s.The other performers are fine as well: Frances Drake, Ted Healy (the man who started the Three Stooges' career), a very young Keye Luke, and especially May Beatty, who steals the show as Gogol's drunken housekeeper. Colin Clive is a bit stiff, and too old for the part; not only that, but he's a very poor finger-syncher.The film ends rather abruptly, but is overall quite satisfying as a psychological thriller. Watch this in a double-feature with "M" and you'll have a greater respect for the marvelous acting of Peter Lorre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One cannot categorize this film simply as horror. It is to horror what the Wicker Man is to Sci-Fi.It is, like many of its genre, a love story. Perhaps a perverse take on the style, it is nonetheless.The first time I saw this film was also my first exposure to Peter Lorre. I have been a fan since.For film fans, this one is just "good."For devout Lorre or cultish weirdo sex fiend fans, this film is a must see.peace and happy days to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish and macabre thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic plot: Remarkable surgeon Dr. Gogol is sickly mesmerized and obsessed with stage actress Yvonne Orlac. Her husband ,a great concert pianist, is injured in a train accident, and when Yvonne brings him to Gogol, his hands must be a amputated , but in an attempt to drive Yvonne into his arms, he gives him the hands of the knife-thrower Rollo. When her husband can't play the piano but throws knives with deadly accuracy, she doesn't exactly come rushing into Gogols arms......The praise: It's stylish,macabre and chilling , Peter Lorre giving off a really good performance as the obsessed Dr. Gogol , fascinated by the sadism and perversion of the horror theater . It gives off a macabre portrait of madness. The rest of the cast is pretty good, Frances Drake and Colin Clive giving well-timed performances . It has thrills, overall creepiness, good story, and a very good script.Karl Freund adds a visual flair and intelligence to it , using expressionism, angles, visual flourishes,patterns and ideas in great , almost painterly composition. Some of the comic relief is funny, some isn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Granddaddy of all severance-anxiety movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only have two comments to add to the fine (especially Ron Oliver's) reviews already posted: (1) This wonderfully creepy little film ought to be recognized as the source of all films manifesting uneasiness about severed body parts and what they may be capable of, from "The Crawling Hand" and 1981's "The Hand" (under-rated, I feel) right down to "Idle Hands" and the memorable man-against-hand battle in "Evil Dead". The objective and rational part of our minds knows that a severed hand can't do anything at all, much less "remember" the skills it once practiced, but way down underneath we're not so sure. And "Mad Love"'s articulation of that fear is classic. (2) Even if you don't like over-the-top B&amp;W 30's horror, see this just to see Peter Lorre. His performance as Dr. Gogol is the definition of the gifted, obsessive, slowly-sliding-over-the-edge mad scientist, from his gentle bedside manner with injured children to his chilling dressing room audience with Yvonne ("You don't understand - I *must* see you.") to the jaw-droppingly baroque-macabre disguise, complete with gleaming robotic hands, he designs to pass as the executed murderer Rollo. I suppose some might find his performance so exaggerated as to be comical (especially when he utters lines later used by that crazed Chihuahua, Ren Hoek - "It is I who am mad!") and I thought the film lost its grip when he began to hear voices, but the first two-thirds of it are just delectable in their shadowy menace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Universal horror movie by MGM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MGM was Lon Chaney's home in the silent era but the great actor delivered his most memorable horror movies under Universal's banner. With the advent of sound and under Carl Laemmle Jr's guidance, Universal tapped even further in this vein of the macabre and delivered smash hit after smash hit of frights and iconic monsters.Other studios were not so eager to go in that direction but they all tried their hand - Paramount with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, MGM with Mad Love. Indeed this is an MGM horror movie that feels like it was made by Universal. The first link is director Karl Freund, a notable and Oscar-winning cinematographer who also directed The Mummy for the rival studio. Here he returns to the genre with another actor legend of his time (Peter Lorre) and his near-iconic horror persona (Dr. Gogol).The concept of the love-struck mad doctor is not a novelty but it is through Peter Lorre's unique physical presence that it's tranformed into a horror villain worthy of a spot in the all-time villain pantheon - when he poses as Rollo the murderer with his fake steel hands, fedora hat, black goggles and that weird neck contraption he's worthy of the iconic looks of even The Invisible Man himself.Ironically the parts I enjoyed most are the comedic bits, mostly coming from the old maid and the interactions of various people with the wax model of Yvonne Orlac, Dr. Gogol's object of desire. The horror part of Mad Love is somewhat weak however, be it Stephen Orlac's unwilling urge to kill (which to return to the Universal comparison reminded me of Talbot's plight in The Wolf Man) that is delivered with Colin Clive's characteristic brand of hammy acting and Peter Lorre's mad doctor. He becomes a doctor Frankenstein not out of scientific ambition but love. The "monster" he creates is the pianist Stephen Orlac. However Peter Lorre, although menacing in some scenes, has something pathetic and pittiful about him I don't really like.All in all Mad Love is a 30's horror movie that will appeal to fans of Universal's monster gallery but is not quite as good or classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I have conquered science! Why can't I conquer love?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Renowned surgeon Dr. Gogol (Peter Lorre) is madly obsessed with an actress named Yvonne Orlac. The feeling, however, is not mutual as Yvonne is married to a pianist named Stephen. When Stephen's gifted and talented hands are crushed in a train wreck, Yvonne begrudgingly seeks Gogol's assistance to save her husband's career. Seeing an opportunity to get in Yvonne's good graces, he agrees to help Stephen. Gogol replaces Stephen's mangled hands with those of a knife throwing murderer only recently put to death. But Gogol's plans for Yvonne backfire when Stephen's new hands prove to have a mind of their own.Overlooked for far too long (probably because it wasn't part of the Universal packages that so many television stations bought and aired), it's good to finally see Mad Love getting so much richly deserved praise. It's a classic in every sense of the word. There are so many facets to the movie I could write about, but, in the name of brevity, I'll try to control myself and limit my comments to two items. The first is the film's look. Technically, Mad Love is nothing short of brilliant. Director Karl Freund was first and foremost a cinematographer ? as Mad Love proves. Freund knew how to shoot a scene. As an example, take a look at the scenes set in the hallway and stairwell of Dr. Gogol's house. They may be insignificant to the overall movie, but you can see the care and effort Freund put into those moments. These scenes are like a painting come to life with their stunningly beautiful mix of light and shadows. Or, take the better known shots of Gogol dressed as the dead knife thrower. Not only are the special effects some of the most frightening of the 30s, the lighting in that scene goes a long way to creating the desired effect. It's an amazing piece of work.Peter Lorre's performance is the other aspect of Mad Love that jumps out at me. Lorre has always been a favorite of mine, but I consider his work in Mad Love the best he ever did. Lorre does more without words in this movie than most actors would be capable of. For example, Gogol's repressed longing for Yvonne is clearly evident on Lorre's face without him even having to utter a word. Or, take the scenes in the operating room. The slow building madness in Lorre's eyes as the surgery progresses is clearly evident. And once again, Lorre doesn't have to utter a word. I consider Lorre's performance in Mad Love to be one of the best in the annals of horror. Brilliant! And I don't know who came up with the idea of the shaved head to go along with Lorre's bulging eyes, but it was a winner. It only serves to highlight Lorre's already expressive features.As I indicated previously, if I allowed myself I could write for days on Mad Love. But I won't. I suppose I could end this by mentioning what has to be the most common criticism of Mad Love that I've read ? the comic relief. But why let something that insignificant ruin what is otherwise a perfect movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An out and out horror classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thirties was something of a golden period for horror movies, and of all the great ones released during the decade, Mad Love is surely one of the best! The best remembered films from this period are often the Universal classics, in particular the ones based on classic monsters such as Dracula and Frankenstein. This film is not based on a well known character, but Peter Lorre's Doctor Gogol can certainly contend with the best of them! The 'mad science' in this film isn't quite as mad now as it was in 1935 as similar operations have now been performed, but Mad Love is still a smart and fascinating slice of classic horror. The plot focuses on Doctor Gogol, a top quality surgeon who also happens to be insane. He develops an obsession with the beautiful actress Yvonne Orlac and wants her to love him as he loves her. After he is rejected by the actress, her husband, a pianist, is involved in a train accident which results in him losing both of his hands. However, Gogol being the great surgeon he is, finds a way to help the situation by replacing the pianist's with those of a dead knife thrower...Peter Lorre has a number of truly great performances to his name; and his role here is undoubtedly one of the best! Lorre always does well when he's playing someone out of the ordinary, and here he manages to convince as the psychotic doctor and keep the audience's attention every time he appears on screen. The plot flows well and the film makes excellent use of its seventy minutes of screen time. The main themes of the plot are the idea of the dead knife thrower taking over the good pianist, and the doctor's obsession with the actress. At its core, Mad Love is really just a deranged love story with horror themes mixed in, and it plays this idea off well. Director Karl Freund (who previously made the Universal classic The Mummy) succeeds in creating a great foreboding atmosphere, and with Gogol's insanity always at the forefront, the film succeeds as a horror flick. It all boils down to a satisfying conclusion that gives closure to all the major plot points. All in all, Mad Love is a great slice of classic horror that more than deserves to at least stand alongside the great films that Universal made in the 1930's. Highly recommended viewing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really weird and exceptionally cool horror tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie starts off relatively slowly and builds and builds to a wonderfully satisfying conclusion. So, if when you first start to watch it it seems a bit dull, please stick with it! Peter Lorre, in one of his earliest American films, plays the obsessive and twisted genius, Dr. Gogol. The part did NOT call for a subtle performance, and Lorre is just great in the role. He is completely infatuated with a stage actress and pledges his undying love for her--at which point she shatters him by telling him that she already is married to pianist, Colin Clive. Shortly after this awkward scene, Clive is in a serious railway accident and his hands are crushed. The doctors tell his wife that there is nothing they can do to save his hands, but the wife remembers Dr. Gogol and asks him to do whatever he can to save the hands. It just so happens that a man was just executed, so Gogol performs a hand transplant. However, quite unexpectedly, Colin's new hands seem to have a mind of their own!!! While this is pretty interesting, the plot does not follow the expected route--as there are some dandy twists and turns--particularly when Clive is implicated for murdering his own father! The very, very end of the film is so ironic and brilliant that this alone is reason to watch the film. Sure, it's well-written and acted as well and turns out to be one of the better horror-suspense films of the era.By the way, try also watching the German silent film, THE HANDS OF ORLAC. MAD LOVE is a remake of this previous film but they are different enough that it's worth seeing them both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the Other Hand...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This mid-thirties MGM exercise in horror is a visual treat, as directed by the great Karl Freund, who was better known as a cinematographer. The sets are gorgeous, the camera angles and compositions no less stunning, and on a purely technical and visual level the film is a tour de force, and in its way a masterpiece. Unfortunately the script gets a little, well, batty, and one can never get away from the improbability of the story, which concerns a concert pianist who loses his hands as the result of a train wreck, only to have them replaced with those of a murderer by an insane surgeon who's in love with his wife and keeps a wax statue of her in his house. This undoubtedly sounds more fun than it is, but the movie takes itself rather seriously, and is too slow-paced and sincere to be camp. Had it been directed by James Whale, who surely would have had Dwight Frye and Edward Van Sloan on hand to give it a little pizazz, it might have worked better. Freund's directorial style is languid, and he conspicuously lacks humor, which this sort of tale desperately requires. He did a magnificent job with The Mummy, where his lugubrious sensibility was perfectly suited to the material, which concerned the living dead, but here is is dealing with people who are very much alive, and sparks are definitely indicated, and yet never present.On the other hand, Peter Lorre is brilliant as the mad and wonderfully named Dr. Gogol, and he dominates the film with his usual schizophrenic authority, as he seems to hear voices and see images in the darnedest places. Frances Drake is stunning as the object of his affections, but is a rather colorless actress, and a tad matronly, suggesting a youthful and pretty Margaret Dumont, which is to say she's aristocratic type, lacking the coarse, magnetic beauty that would drive a man mad. Were I an earl I can well imagine wanting to make Miss Drake my wife, but for the life of me I can't imagine chasing her all over town, as Gogol does. Colin Clive is surprisingly uninteresting as the pianist who loses his hands, and gains another's. And he looks awful. A mere four years had passed since he had first played Dr. Frankenstein. It seems more like forty. The smaller roles are nicely limned by, among others, Billy Gilbert, as an autograph hound, Ed Brophy as Rollo, the knife thrower, and Ted Healy, former honcho of the Three Stooges, and now a solo act. Now if only Moe, Larry and Curly had showed up this movie might have been something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Lorre's Moody Horror Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Gogol is mad, to begin with. Quite mad. I know he's a great &amp; celebrated surgeon, but one needs only to look into those thick-lidded eyes to see the lunatic peering out. How else can one explain his obsession with the actress Yvonne, or his hatred of her pianist husband, Orlac? Now that Orlac has lost both his hands in a railway accident, why is Gogol attaching the hands of Rollo, the executed knife-throwing killer, onto Orlac's arms? Does Gogol wish to drive Orlac insane, making him believe that his hands have a mind of their own? And what of Yvonne? What will happen when Gogol tries to make her share his MAD LOVE?MGM produced only a few horror films in the 1930's, but they tended to be rather special. Thanks to its director, the great Karl Freund, and its star, bizarre little Peter Lorre, this movie compares nicely to the German classics which preceded it. Lorre is perfectly cast, sinking further into uncontrollable mania as his plot to trap Yvonne progresses. (Notice the carniverous plant on his desk - a nice touch.) His impersonation of the guillotined Rollo, complete with mechanical hands &amp; reattached head, is unforgettable.Frances Drake &amp; Colin Clive, as Gogol's victims, both play their parts well. Their panic, as the Doctor's machinations unwind, is most believable. Edward Brophy makes the small role of Rollo memorable; the look on his face, when he first sees the guillotine blade, registers genuine admiration. Ted Healy as an American newspaperman, Sara Haden as Yvonne's maid &amp; May Beatty as Gogol's housekeeper, all offer much-needed comic relief.Film mavens should spot uncredited performances by Ian Wolfe as Orlac's stepfather; Clarence Wilson as a moneylender; and especially bubbly Billy Gilbert as the man on the train with the dog.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M notwithstanding, MAD LOVE is probably Peter Lorre at his very best: his bulging eyes and sinister whisper combine to make his ghoulish Dr. Gogol (whose obsessive patronage of the Grand Guignol theater leads in the end to disaster) very Strange- but also strangely Sympathetic. In M, his unsavory character stalked unsuspecting children; here, he moons for a beautiful woman he can never really hope to possess and it's an absolutely riveting performance- one of the finest in the history of Fright Films. Director Freund no doubt deserves a great deal of credit for what we see here, but it's Lorre at his bug-eyed best who commands center stage. An outstanding movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A minor horror classic, marred only by some unwelcome comic relief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The classic story of The Hands of Orlac is 'grafted' (sorry) on to this tale of doomed love and romance. Essentially a showcase for Peter Lorre's creepy talents, it's clear that without Lorre's presence this would be a much less interesting film. Every moment he's on screen, Lorre dominates the proceedings, and his physical image - bug eyes, bald head - has never been better than in this. He's creepy, disturbing and also strangely tragic, like a lost puppy.This is very much a product of the '30s, and has the same highlights and low points as many other films of the time. On the plus side, the film is visually arresting, with crisp black and white photography adding plenty of atmosphere to the sets and scenery, highlighting the light and dark areas. The acting is pretty intense all round too; it comes dangerously close to being laughably over the top, yet it works for me. Lorre is excellent as the brilliant yet doomed doctor; Frances Drake is the beautiful object of his affection, and her physical presence was more than enough for me (I didn't really notice her acting abilities). Colin Clive is on hand to lend yet another harrowed performance in the FRANKENSTEIN vein, and it's only Ted Healy who disappoints as a reporter. This leads me on to the film's main flaw; the use of silly comic relief, and there's far too much of it.This unwelcome comedy marred many films of the same period (check out THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN). Oh well, we can only watch and shake our heads and think how much things have moved on since then, I suppose. MAD LOVE does have a number of classy, exciting moments. The most memorable would be when Lorre dresses up in a neck brace and pretends to be the dead killer, returned from the grave (his image here was very influential - check out BODY PARTS). Clive's knife-throwing scenes are tremendously fun, while the fast-paced ending doesn't disappoint either. I really liked Edward Brophy's performance as the murderer Rollo, too - he was hilarious. A minor classic of the genre, this isn't scary but instead acts as a showcase for Lorre's huge talents, while being an entertaining, and quick-moving tale of madness, revenge, murder and...amputation!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mad Love, more like ingenious love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mad Love is an absolute superb horror film from 1935 starring Peter Lorre as Dr Gogol. In this movie Dr Gogol has an object of affection called Yvonne. However there is a difficulty for him as she is married and does not care much for Gogol at all of his affections for her. As Dr Gogol says during the movie he can conquer science but he cannot conquer love. The frustration for the latter certainly is one that shared by many people around the world. Dr Gogol's frustration in not able to conquer love served as pivotal plot piece and which drives his madness in wanting Yvonne. This all served the movie superbly right up to its denouement and this all thanks in excellent form by Peter Lorre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every year Turner Classics employs the weekends of October to prepare for the annual Halloween holiday. One of their themes this year was the appropriately named 'rogue body parts', kicked off by the airing of this Peter Lorre horror classic from 1935. I had to think about the rogue body parts business but it makes perfect sense if you think about it and how it relates to the story here.If you've never seen a bald Peter Lorre before you're in for a treat. The look adds to an already demented and creepy appearance usually augmented by those shifty eyes, and with director Karl Freund's effective use of shadow and light, there are times Dr. Gogol (Lorre) takes on an almost demonic appearance. At one point in the story, Gogol comes almost completely unglued as he removes an intricately devised harness from his neck and head that would have made Hannibal Lecter proud.As desperate as the circumstances are for Gogol's patient Steven Orlac (Colin Clive) and his wife Yvonne (Frances Drake), the picture manages to interject a fair amount of humor into the story. Gogol's housekeeper Marie (Sarah Haden) is an absolute trip with her pet cockatoo. In one particular scene the photographer captured a wonderful shadow of the bird on her shoulder affecting an over-sized headdress. Newspaperman Reagan (Ted Healy) played off the housekeeper in a couple of scenes that would have convinced you this was a comedy had the overall story not been so grim.Ultimately the film ends in tragedy for Gogol who goes mad in his obsession for the love of a woman he can never attain. The theme of 'each man kills the thing he loves' runs throughout the picture, though in Dr. Gogol's case, he is pre-empted by the accurate throw of a knife by the hand he grafted onto the arm of Orlac, an irony easily overlooked during the frantic finish of this off beat horror film.If the idea of crawling hands appeals to you, I would direct you to the 1960 film "Tormented", or better yet, have another go round with Peter Lorre in the 1946 film "The Beast With Five Fingers". That film followed "Mad Love" on this year's rogue body parts extravaganza on Turner Classics.</fullReview>

This is mainly thanks to the role of Peter Lorre as the creepy looking and acting Dr. Gogol. That gaze in his eyes, that laugh when he disguised himself as the murderer that was insanely good. Another good role was for Gogol's housekeeper played by May Beatty together with her parrot putting some humor in an otherwise very serious and dark movie. Gogol's love interest Yvonne is played by Frances Drake, beautiful actress of who the doctor keeps a wax statue in his home. At the start of the movie I really thought that statue was a real person, so real it looked. The scene where Yvonne pretends to be the statue to fool Gogol is just awesome.

		<fullReview>Peter Lorre plays Dr. Gogol, a brilliant surgeon with an obsession with an actress, married to a pianist(played by Frankenstein's Colin Clive). When the Pianist's hands are mangled in a train accident, Gogol takes the hands of a guillotined knife-thrower and sews them onto the pianist. While he can no longer play the piano, he can throw a mean knife.This leads to a convoluted plot where Lorre frames the pianist for murder and stalks the man's wife. The day is saved when Clive puts his newly found knife-throwing skills to good use by impaling Gogol in the back before he can strangle his wife.Adding comic relief to the movie is Ted Healy, best remembered today for giving the Three Stooges their start, playing an American reporter trying to figure out what Gogol did with the dead knife-thrower's body.</fullReview>

Later Dr. Gogol got the shock of his life when after her last show when he came to see her back stage when Yvonne told him that she was quitting acting. Even worse that she's secretly married to the handsome world famous concert pianist Stephen Orlac, Colin Clive.Gogol loses it when his beloved Yvonne left him for another man, Yvonne never really had anything to do with Gogol romantically, that he goes into a deep depression with the only thing that he has left of Yvonne is her wax statue in the theater lobby that he bought when her show folded. When later in the movie her husband Stephen is badly hurt in a rail accident Yvonne, against her better judgment, gets in touch with Dr. Gogol to save Stephen's precious hands that were badly mangled in the accident. Dr. Gogol secretly attached the hands of a knife wilding murderer who was executed just that morning on to Stephen wrists.Stephen soon realizes that the hands that he has are not his hands. They don't play the piano like he used to and they seem to have a very strong liking to throw knives. Dr. Gogol's depression gets rekindled when Yvonne realizes that he purposely put the killer's hands on her husband and lets him have it. Later Gogol, in a fit of anger, goes to Stephen's father jewelry store and knifes him to death and leaves clues to implicate Stephen, who had a fight with his father just the day before, for the murder. Gogol thinks that Steven's fathers murder would break up his and Yvonne's marriage by putting Stephen behind bars and, in Gogol's sick mind, give his a second chance with Yvonne. One of Peter Lorre's best performances as the heart-sick and eventually insane Dr. Gogol as he desperately tries to win over Yvonne's heart but ends up destroying himself. Crazed and heavily drunk in the end Dr. Gogol can't function anymore as the great surgeon that he once was and it's truly tragic to see his sad and cataclysmic downfall. I felt even more sympathy for Dr. Gogol then I did for King Kong in his sorrowful and forbidden love for Yvonne and just, no matter what Gogol did, couldn't dislike him. Love is a very strange force of nature it can bring the best as well as the worst out of all of us. In the sad case of Dr. Gogol it destroyed a brilliant surgeon who could have saved the lives, and limbs, of hundreds of people and the love and gratitude that Dr. Gogol would have gotten from those that he would have saved with his God-given talent, as a man of medicine, would have far more made up for the love that Yvonne denied him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lorre's first defining moment in American cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some actors have one defining moment on screen. Some better ones have several, yet only a select few have several defining moments each in several different films. Peter Lorre has to be considered in this elite group. "Mad Love", Peter's first American film, is a dramatic tour-de-force, a perfect encapsulation of the scope and depth of Lorre's talents as a performer. To say that his reading of Doctor Gogol earmarked him for later Hollywood ghoulism would be an over-generalized judgement, not to mention a gross understatement. What the part did that his performance in "M" did not was to showcase his complete mastery of psychological characterization, taking Lorre's Hans Beckert one step further and offering a more well-rounded portrait of method and motivation, while also reflecting a balanced development of increasing mental instability.The story is really quite ludicrous. The brilliant european surgeon Gogol falls for a beautiful, yet artificial Grand Guignol theater actress. Gogol finds out actress has the brilliant piano player Orlac for husband. Brilliant piano player loses hands in a freak train accident. Gogol, now completely obsessed with the woman whom he cannot have, but still believing that he might get her to fall for him through sympathetic indebtedness, surgically replaces brilliant piano player's hands with those of a knife throwing murderer, recently executed. Gogol begins to gaslight piano player through several psychological devices, finally resorting to murder in order to frame the piano player and win the beautiful actress away from him.The story here is NOT the story. It is the story of a great performance. Lorre, head shaved, as to somehow accent the alienation and aloneness echoed in his bulbous eyes and cheeksome profile; Lorre, impeccably dressed, as to somehow accent his orderly and somewhat anal retentive bedside manner and ultra logical thought processes, becomes beautifully unhinged at the cerebrum, his madness slowly unfolding like the twisted petals of some beautiful black flower.Lorre utilizes both the subtle and overblown; exquisitely dramatic body and hand gestures, grotesque facial manipulations and schizophrenic, mirrorglass soliloquies soothingly whispered with all the romantic poesy of a narcissistic paranoiac: the ever-so-slight sado-machoistic quiver of Lorre's eyebrow and lower lip as he contemplates the guillotine blade fulfilling its destiny during a public execution; The soft, loving caress of Lorre's calming pre-op reassurance to a little girl; Lorre, disguised as the dead reanimated, offering a final, hideous cackle of insanity as he uses the powers of psychological suggestion to set in motion his final, twisted plan to conquer love.Lorre bridges beautifully the poles between selflessness and selfishness, between genius and madness, between love and obsession, between logic and insanity in this brilliantly conceived one-man show. Oh, lest we not forget, there are other performances in the film too, though sometimes, especially late at night when you are watching the film alone in some dark solitude during a rainswept, autumn night, you tend to forget the others and become mesmerized by the vision of perfection in both craftsmanship and originality that is Lorre's grand Gogol.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Method in its madness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made by MGM in an unsuccessful attempt to tap the same market as the Universal horror films, this is not so much an imitation of "The Mummy," "Dracula," the Frankensteins, or "The Invisible Man" as a quasi-intentional send-up that rivals "Young Frankenstein" or "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" in its sexy, winking energy. A much more skillfully crafted film than any of its Universal rivals, it outclasses them entirely by its choice of stars, the young and good-to-go Peter Lorre. Still enjoying the international acclaim from his performance in "M," not yet miserably typed as a "horror boy," he attacks the role of the Napoleonic orthopedic surgeon Dr. Gogol with a wild melodramatic verve reminiscent of Lon Chaney Sr. No mere Karloff or Lugosi could have pulled off some of the tour-de-force moments he has here: the sequence in which a condemned man's guillotining is graphically shown just through Gogol's eye movements, for instance, or the chilling moment in which Gogol silently achieves orgasm while watching his ladylove being tortured onstage. No wonder Malcolm Lowry made "Los Manos de Orlac con Peter Lorre" the metaphorical centerpiece of his "Under the Volcano." For all its humor and absurdities, this is a film with rare emotional power.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the few times that Hollywood has taken an outside movement of film, tried to create one like it, AND gotten it right (the last part always seems to be the hardest most of the time). Of course, it helps that they used the underrated Karl Freund (who also directed Universal's original "The Mummy") as pointman. Thanks to his presense, everything from the surreal opening credits sequence to the final showdown conveys a suffocating atmos-fear (pun intended) of darkness. Peter Lorre, in his American film debut, is eerily believable as Dr. Golgol, a gifted surgeon slowly sliding into the bowels of madness over an unrequited love for an already-married stage actress. Anyone who questions the believability of the plot would do well to remember John Hinckley Jr., whose own obsession for Jodie Foster led to his attempted assasination of Reagan. Colin Clive is also very good here, as Orlac, a pianoist tormented by the suspicion that his new hands may be his ruin, but instead prove to be his wife's salvation.Freund draws the viewers' attention to certain details, be it the soon-to-be-executed murderer's hands, the moody music Orlac plays over the radio as Golgol has a confrontation with Mrs. Orlac, the mirror hanging over the operation table as Golgol hits upon a scheme to use against his patient, and so on. Why this movie is not better known and/or revered is beyond me, not only for the fact that it marked Lorre's entry into American cinema but that it was one of the best horror films to come out of the 1930's. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mad Love displays in all of his tragic-comic dimensions the genius of Peter Lorre. It may not be his greatest performance, but if one had to ask to see something- outside of M of course- to see what was the big deal outside of the character actor parts in Bogart pictures to seek out this near-classic of the mad scientist/doctor horror movie. His range is actually incredible considering his reputation with his roles and his personality as impressionable as it is. Dare i say it, he has some moments of subtlety here, where we see him crushed and broken but trying to keep it internalized. Then again these moments are fairly few: Lorre knows what's needed for the part, which is to make this doctor realistically sad in his attempts to connect with those around him while acting like the mad doctor that the premise promises him to be.He's Doctor Gogol (of the Russian 19th century literary fame I guess) who does wonders on his patients, close to saving a little girl and has even his own side-show attraction like a headless man. But when he falls for an actress, Yvonne Drake, he doesn't realize she's very happily married to the rich and talented pianist Stephen Orlac, and it hits pretty hard... that is until he sees his opportunity with a sudden train wreck which ruins his hands. The solution, dear readers: take the executed hands of a knife-throwing killer, and just put them on the pianist making it two-fold a diabolical plot of ruining his career and making him an unintentional murderer. But can he conquer the human heart? Answers may lie to "NO!" but you'll have to see for yourselves.It would be lying to say the results aren't at least a little bizarre (the way Gogol goes for one more double-twist by dressing up as the supposed dead man who's had his hands AND his head attached back on is almost too creepy to be funny), and some moments are laugh out-loud funny, not even of the unintentional sort (that woman who gets drunk and sees the woman as being the statue is one thing). And yet as Lorre brings it to one dimension it's the film-making that elevates this as something much richer than your average mad doctor story. How could it not be special with Karl Freund (look at his list of credits as cinematographer from everything important Fritz Lang for justification of his importance in cinema history) and Greg Toland (Citizen Kane, Ford's big late 30s/early 40s films) lensing the film? It's such a pleasure to look at and with some real shots of daring even for today that you can lose yourself with the images, with that delightfully insane and bald Lorre stepping or leaning closer into frame, his eyes bulging with the insidious back-lighting or curious framing.Some of the actors in the cast range from very good to OK, but they're decent enough background for what matters here. The plot isn't entirely knew, but what's done with it is what counts, and Mad Love is something to make your skin crawl, your funny bone tickled and prodded, and wonder in awe why Peter Lorre wasn't more of a legend in his own time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most stylish and overlooked horror films of the 30s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mad Love" is one of the most stylish and overlooked horror films of the 30s, a decade revered for its horror milestones. Amidst the more well-known Universal pictures, "Mad Love" seemed to get lost in the the shuffle. Thats really a shame, as its one of the most atmospheric pictures of the time and at moments achieves a sense of weird poetry. As usual, Peter Lorre gives a fantastic performance. Lorre was one of those actors who, no matter how bad his material was, would always give the best effort he could. Doctor Gogol is one of his best creations, an evil yet tragic figure. Colin Clive (best known as Dr. Frankenstein in the original) and the beautiful Frances Drake give fine support, but they're obviously dwarfed by the magnificent Lorre.The direction by Karl Freund is very accomplished. The film looks beautiful and gives any silent film a run for their money. There are moments when it achieves a dreamlike surrealism, particularly towards the end when you're not quite sure which character is mad. Plus, it loads on the melodrama which makes it quite a romantic film. This can be a bad thing (detracting from the credibility of the story), but since "Mad Love" is often a fairy tale at heart its adds a lot. Plus, the film moves at an appropriate pace, not too quick to barely touch upon the characters but fast enough so genre fans don't lose interest. The only thing that really drags this film down is the unfunny comic relief from the alcoholic maid and the stock character of the wisecracking performer. Still, this deserves much more recognition that it has received. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PETER LORRE stars in this film masterfully directed by Karl Freund and photographed by Gregg Toland in the best German expressionist style. It's the kind of role that turned Lorre into the screen's foremost anti-hero of suspenseful horror classics.He's Dr. Gogol, a mad doctor so in love with an actress (FRANCES DRAKE) that when her musician husband (COLIN CLIVE) loses his hands in a train wreck, the doctor arranges to have the hands of an executed murderer attached to the pianist. The musician's wife thinks he is merely performing an operation to replace the man's own hands.The plot thickens when Clive discovers he can no longer play pieces on the piano in his former way and has a propensity for throwing knives with alarming accuracy. Of course, when Lorre's scheme becomes known to the wife, her life is in danger and so is her husband's, especially after the doctor has a wax figure of the woman transported to his apartment. A few clever twists take care of the rest of the story.Fun to watch as a Gothic horror film, a Halloween sort of fantasy come to life. Lorre is excellent in the key role of the mad doctor with a Pygmalion complex and Frances Drake makes the perfect foil for his mad schemes. COLIN CLIVE acts in that silent screen manner that he's famous for (think of FRANKENSTEIN), but Sara Haden and Key Luke do nicely in supporting roles.As the American reporter, TED HEALY plays a brash American reporter in a manner that rivals Lee Tracy. Why are these reporters always pictured as such caricatures of The Ugly American??? Summing up: Well worth watching for Lorre's expertise in one of his maddest roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those viewers who have only seen Peter Lorre in self-spoofing roles, this film is a revelation. His Dr. Gogol is a believable character with understandable motivations, who slowly goes insane, rather than a stereotypical mad scientist. His scenes with Frances Drake as the beautiful actress who tolerates him because of his helping her husband,are sensitive and powerful. Gogol is a sad, lonely man, but the sympathy he arouses does not prevent the viewer from recoiling from his more bizarre behaviors. The movie has an atmosphere not quite like any other. Truly horrific moments alternate with scenes of offbeat humor that are totally unexpected. The film's odd humor almost obscures the way that it becomes darker and the atmosphere more menacing toward the end. Directed by Karl Freund of The Mummy and Dracula, and written by John L. Balderston of the same Universal horror classics,this rare film is worth the effort of finding it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Story: Stephen Orlac (Colin "Dr. Frankenstein" Clive) is a pianist who gets his hand crushed in an accident. His wife, Yvonne Orlac (Frances Drake), is a stage actress who enlists in the aide of Dr. Gogol (Peter Lorre) to restore her husband's hands. Dr. Gogol is madly in love and obsessed with Yvonne and will do anything to win her love. He performs an experimental surgery and attaches the hands of a knife throwing murders to Stephen. Stephen can not longer play the piano after rehab, but he is one hell of a knife thrower.My review: What is not to like about this brilliant classic horror movie. Peter Lorre is brilliant as Dr. Gogol is his American movie debut. He is the quintessential mad scientist, brilliant, creepy, and obsessed. Colin Clive does a solid job as Stephen, and Frances Drake does fine as Yvonne.The movie gets stranger and crazier as it moves along. The climax is wonderful and director Karl Freund does an excellent job. Overall, this is a must see for fans of classic horror.</fullReview>

The poor husband gets suspicious when he has trouble playing the piano and would rather throw knives at people instead.There was just no one like Peter Lorre when it comes to playing these obsessed roles. I just don't know why anyone ever came to him for surgical services. Unlike one of the posters, who found him sympathetic, he scared the hell out of me. And that housekeeper of his was terrifying in her own right.Frances Drake is very good as the loving wife and object of Dr. Orlac's affections. The film is very well done and atmospheric.

		<fullReview>Mad Love was Peter Lorre's first American horror movie and also one of his best.Dr Gogol falls deeply in love with actress Yvonne Orlac and when her pianist husband looses his hands in a train crash, he puts him on a new pair. Problem is, Mr Orlac's new hands are from an executed murderer and he later murders his father and is arrested. Gogal keeps stalking Mrs Orlac and is stabbed to death at the end and she is safe.Mad Love is very creepy in parts, especially Peter Lorre. The only annoying thing was the housekeeper's cockatiel flying around towards the end which was a little distracting from the main story.Joining Lorre in the cast are Francis Drake as Yvonne Orlac, Colin Clive (Frankenstein, Bride Of Frankenstein)as her husband and a good performance from May Beatty as the drunken housekeeper.I rather enjoyed watching Mad Love, despite it being a little weird at times.Rating: 3 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great, little gem of a film that deserves a viewing from anyone interested in expressionist film. Director Karl Freund gives a wonderful sense of the macabre to the interior shots, and the delightfully morbid sense of humor used throughout the film is a constant delight. Peter Lorre gives a stellar performance as the bizarre, bug-eyed Dr. Gogol, whose obsessive lust for the lovely Yvonne Orlac propels the movie. Hoping to be close to her, he agrees to operate on her pianist husband after a train accident leaves his hands crushed. Unbeknownst to either Yvonne or her husband, Dr. Gogol has transplanted the hands of the recently guillotined knife-thrower murderer, Rollo, onto Mr. Orlac. Shortly after he is able to use the hands again, Mr. Orlac notices that they seem to have a mind of their own, and they want to kill! Peter Lorre's portrayal of Dr. Gogol's descent into total psychosis is masterfully done. Some of the humor in the film is played over the top, especially the constantly besotted maid whose performance just goes overboard, but otherwise there is a skillful mix of comedy and horror. All-in-all, a fine example of expressionist filmmaking, one that never fails to delight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After an accident leaves him with crushed hands, a concert pianist's wife goes to the obsessed doctor in love with her to help him get over the accident, and when he agrees, the serial killer's hands he chooses for the operation have a life of their own after the successful surgery.This was enjoyable for what it was, though it's still quite flawed at times. As was the case most often with these early 30s horror efforts, not a whole lot of time is spent on actual horror, as the love affair showcased isn't all that well thought-out, leaving this one to just completely meander around during the beginning. While this makes his transformation into a psycho all the more credible, the actions don't move the film along into the horror arena. It's also pretty incredulous to believe the complete lack of knowledge gathered into who's hands were used, as the police investigation turns up nothing and the reporter never solves it, but for such an important procedure to take place, the fact that there's hardly anything known about that isn't brought up makes this section wholly unbelievable. While not a lot of action is done to suggest that this is a horror film, it certainly looks the part with it's impressive visuals, great layout and rather chilling sets as well as the fun final twenty minutes when the ruse has been uncovered, which does drag it out of the doldrums but is hardly enough to make it an out-and-out classic.Today's Rating-PG: Mild Violence</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do Not Play With Knives.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this reasonably good 1935 film, Peter Lorre is Dr. Gogol, a genius at surgery who is driven irretrievably mad by his love for Frances Drake. Drake is an actress at the Grand Guignol Theater in Paris. The shows at the theater consist of nothing more than scenes of staged torture featuring different characters, much like today's unending stream of slasher movies, appealing to the most noble parts of human nature.Drake, however, is married to a renowned pianist, Colin Clive as Stephen Orlac. You'll remember Colin Clive when you see him. You'll probably recall his most famous lines: "Get BECK! Oh, get BECK! -- It's ALIVE!" Gogol attends every show that features Frances Drake, hopeless as his love is. It's a kind of self torture. She, on the other hand, has no idea that his passion for her extends beyond her role as an actress.Then Clive has his marvelous hands crushed in a train accident. (Good scene.) Drake importunes Lorre to help, so Lorre takes the hands of a recently guillotines murderer who was a circus knife thrower, and attaches them to the stumps of Clive's wrists. The hands seem to take on a life of their own, with Clive still unable to play the piano well but now a skilled thrower of knives.This is a familiar theme, probably started by Maurice Renard's novel, "The Hands of Orlac" (1920). It was not only made into a silent film in 1924 but remade again in 1962. And on top of that there have been myriad variations on the theme. Michael Caine had trouble with his hand in the innovatively titled "The Hand." I don't think we need to go on to list all the other transplant horror movies. There are enough to make me think twice about having a hair transplant. Brain transplants alone would run to thousands of pages. And then there's Frankenstein's monster with his enormous Schwanz in Mel Brooks' movie, "Young Dr. Frankenstein." As Dr. Gogol -- where do they get these names? -- as Dr. Gogol, Peter Lorre is really rather creepy. He keeps popping up with queerly apt quotes. "Each man kills the things he loves," from Oscar Wilde, and later some shtick from "Othello". His face is chubby and pasty, his head is shaved, his eyeballs pop, he plays mournful music on the organ, and as he descends into madness he begins to look and act drunk instead of just insane. His lower lip droops and he seems to drool. There are a couple of horrific scenes that will scare the kids, the most likely being the one in which Lorre poses as the guillotined man and rips open his collar to show the neck brace and metal struts that keep his head attached to his body. His wild and manic cackle is spooky.I thought it was well done, as these things go. It was part of a series of shocking monster and horror flicks that came out of Hollywood and elsewhere in the 1930s. After 1935, they declined rapidly in quality and lost their surprise value. There was a brief revival of horror flicks, half spoofs of themselves, in the early 60s, and then about 20 years ago a new cycle began that has yet to exhaust itself. For the most part they're pretty revolting gore fests, not nearly as scary as some of the better done, practically antiseptic movies like "The Exorcist" and "Rosemary's Baby."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Lorre is Dr. Gogol, an insanely jealous surgeon in love with the beautiful Yvonne Orlac (Frances Drake), who is married to the concert pianist, Stephen Orlac (Colin Clive). When her husband is involved in a train accident that crushes and disfigures his hands horribly, Yvonne seeks the aid of Dr. Gogol to heal him. He does this by transplanting the hands of a freshly executed murderer. But then he realizes that he can use this to drive a wedge between his love and her husband.This is the basic premise of Mad Love, a splendid little movie with murder, uncertainty, identity confusion and a nasty little love triangle, that is sure to please a lot of viewers.Peter Lorre makes me feel slimy in most roles that I've seen him in, and Mad Love is no exception. His villainous performances are always exceptional. Colin Clive, better known as Dr. Henry Frankenstein in James Whales' Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein, also does a great job as the troubled and confused transplant recipient. Frances Drake is also touching as the caring wife and gentle soul who befriends the lonely Dr. Gogol.The story is compelling and has some interesting twists, the script is entertaining with an appropriate amount of humor along with a more menacing tone, and the acting is good. Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mad Love" is another retelling of "The Hands of Orlac" which has been filmed in several versions over the years. This one stars a baby faced/bald headed Peter Lorre, the quintessential creepy little mad man/killer, in the lead role.Dr. Gogol (Lorre) a famous and brilliant surgeon is enamored of Yvonne (Frances Drake) a performer in a show in the House of Horrors. He has attended all 47 performances of the play. Following the final performance, he goes to her dressing room to confess his love for her. Much to his chagrin, he learns that she is married to emerging composer/pianist Stephan Orlac (Colin Clive).Despondent, Gogol consoles himself by buying the wax statue of Yvonne and bringing it to his home and resigning himself to his fate. However fate takes a hand. Orlac is involved in a train wreck in which his hands are maimed and are about to be amputated. Yvonne, remembering that Dr. Gogol is a skilled surgeon, goes to him for help.In the meantime, Gogol had been attending the execution of a knife throwing killer, Rollo (Edward Brophy). When Gogol examines Orlac, he realizes the man's hands cannot be saved. However, in an effort to win favor with Yvonne, Gogol obtains the hands of the killer Rollo and grafts them onto Orlac. At first everything seems normal.As Orlac tries to play the piano, he can no longer play with his former skill. He begins to experience uncontrollable urges to throw knives. As the months pass, the couple becomes wanting and Orlac goes to his father for help. They argue and Orlac impulsively throws a knife at him but misses.The evil Gogol slowly sinking into madness, sees his opportunity. He murders Orlac's father and has the blame placed up on Stephen Orlac. He then turns his attention toward Yvonne and........................For Lorre, this was his first American film and a chilling performance it was. In particular there is a scene where he assumes the identity of the executed Rollo and meets with the desperate Orlac. Also his scenes with Frances Drake are so scary because of the way Lorre plays them. With that famous voice and bug eyes, he'd scare the pants off (no pun intended) any lady.Others in the cast include Ted Healy (without the Three Stooges) as the requisite fast talking reporter, who adds nothing to the story, May Beatty in a marvelous comedy turn as Gogol's boozy maid Francoise and Billy Gilbert as a passenger on the train on which Orlac is traveling.Colin Clive may best be remembered as Dr. Henry Frankenstein in "Frankenstein" (1931) and "Bride of Frankenstein" (1935). He had personal problems which contributed to his early death in 1937.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant surgeon Dr Gogol is in 'mad love' with actress Yvonne Orlac. Night after night he watches her performance in a Grand Guignol production where he almost passes out with ecstasy during her torture scenes. Clearly insane, Gogol's final decent into madness is exacerbated by the news that Yvonne is retiring from acting to tour with her genius pianist husband Stephen. Gogol's evenings are spent lamenting his loss with a waxwork replica of the actress; regaling it with declarations of love and piano sonatas. When Stephen Orlacs hands are severed in a train smash, Yvonne goes to Gogol for help. Gogol acquires the hands of a recently executed maniac and grafts them on to the stricken musician with questionable success. What Stephen now lacks in musical dexterity is more than made up for by a murderous rage and deadly knife throwing abilities. After a row with his father, Stephen is blamed for murdering him. Gogol seizes his chance to frame Stephen and vent his 'mad love'.An almost forgotten classic, Mad Love is a creaky expressionist chiller based on Maurice Renard's 'Les Main D'Orlac' (The Hands of Orlac) and was directed by shadow-miester Karl Freund who later went on to direct The Mummy and lens 'greatest movie ever made 'Citizen Kane. Mad Love is a fairytale of the darkest timbre, but its main thrust about creepy limb transplants is totally derailed by Lorre's murderously 'lost in love' Dr Gogol. With his baby smooth skin and bulging eyes Gogol is a bizarre arrangement of ping pong balls and reptilian charm. His whining whispery voice seems to slither around you until it finds a suitable opening in your clothing ? or worse ? your skin! Mad Love was Lorre's first major role in the states having established himself in Germany with the Fritz Lang classic 'M'. Here Lorre turns in an early example of his unhinged outsider shtick ? and although he acts everybody else off the screen ? it's no great stretch when you consider that here he's playing opposite the likes of 'Frankenstein's Colin Clive who, as always, displayed more ham than Fray Bentos. Mad Love is a Tim Burton film before there was Tim Burton. The scene in which Gogol disguises himself as the resurrected killer in surgical braces and artificial limbs to convince Stephen that he's responsible for his father's murder is as jarring an image of abject revulsion ever committed to celluloid ? the diabolical offspring of Humpty Dumpty and Edward Scissor Hands.During a film course I attended in Brighton a few years ago legendary film maker Jack Cardiff related the tale of Peter Lorre's 'dying' on the set of a film he was directing and then suddenly coming back to life and asking for directions for the nearest bar whilst being given his last rites. Lorre's life was a litany of persecution, (a Hungarian Jew ? he had to flee the holocaust) typecasting (forever tagged as the worlds greatest 'Peter Lorre type' actor) and morphine addiction. Whatever the source of Lorre's demons, it can't ever be said that he didn't make those demons work for him. Mad Love alone is testament to that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The doctor is in.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the most part, I enjoyed this little-known classic. The story is of a mad surgeon, Dr. Gogol, who is obsessed and in love with an actress, except she is already married to a pianist. After a train wreck, the pianist's hands are badly injured and the Doctor is his only hope. He replaces the hands with those of a recently executed, knife-throwing murderer. All is well except for the strange feelings and tendencies the piano man is now having with his new hands. Doctor Gogol sees this as an opportunity to get what he really wants and jumps all over it with a deceptive and twisted plan.As has been said before, the sets and cinematography are good and make for an interesting watch. Peter Lorre played Dr. Gogol, and did a great job at it. From his accent to his eyes to his overall appearance, he fit this role well. It's also decently directed and even features a few creepy scenes.The story, at times, was a bit silly or unbelievable but not so much as to ruin the film. The pace was a bit slow but that is hardly a problem with a running time of only 68 minutes. It is definitely worth a watch, if you can get your hands on it. FYI, this film is actually a remake of Orlacs Hände (1924) and was remade again as The Hands of Orlac (1960).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only saw the last half of the film, but it was pretty impressed by Lorre. His performance was splendidly creepy and pathetic as the insane doctor. What was an especially nice touch of characterization was the use of the Pygmalion myth to highlight Gogol's frustration at being a brilliant surgeon yet unable to "conqueror" love by winning the heart of beautiful Yvonne Orlac. His only recourse to lavish his affections upon her in the form a terrifyingly realistic wax figurine, whom he wished would come to life by the power of his love... It takes a man like Lorre to pull off such a tragic yet horrific character as Gogol. It's a shame that Clive's performance as the maimed then 'cursed' Stephen Orlac came across as yet another mediocre hero, but that's forgivable. The atmosphere and overall morbidness of the film more than make up for the film's faults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining 'Mad Scientist' Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his first American film, Peter Lorre plays Dr. Orlac, famous orthopedist who's madly in love with married stage actress, Yvonne, played by Frances Drake. When Stephen (Colin Clive), her painist husband has his hands crushed in a train accident, Dr. Orlac sees his chance. First, replace the damaged hands with those of a recently executed murderer, who was also an expert with knives, don't tell Stephen, and then wait for the weird stuff to start happening. Stephen's not going to be playing any pianos soon, but he slowly realizes what skills his hands do have, and what they want to do.Shot in the popular horror film style of the 1930s, "Mad Love" is an entertaining entry in the 'mad scientist' niche of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lorre is at his best; Clive and Drake leave a bit to be desired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luckily, Peter Lorre's excellent performance in this chilling film isn't overshadowed by the (in my humble opinion) subpar acting skills of Frances Drake and Colin Clive. I can't judge the actors themselves as I've never seen these two in anything else, but in this film Frances Drake's flustered squealing and Clive's sometimes-underacting sometimes-over-the-top-with-exaggerated-flailing-of-the-hands style got a bit irritating. They seem to be a potentially good pair of thespians, but most certainly not at their best here.Mr. Lorre's portrayal of Dr. Gogol is creepy, yet heart-rending - I cannot help but feel sorry for this lovelorn soul. He does terrible things, yet one cannot consider him evil -- his somewhat contorted view of the world leads him to believe that he is the only one for Yvonne, and his crimes are not for money, for greed, but for love. One might say that he has Yvonne's best interests in his heart, whatever he does, because, in his view, whatever will get her with him will be better for her in the end.His eyes half-lidded with ecstasy during the initial scene as he watches the voyeuristic horror play.his pleading, desperate, almost puppy-like appearance as he attempts to woo Yvonne.his frightened and confused face shifting to sly determination as he descends into madness (well, further than he already was, anyway).his insane excitement during the final scene as he believes his dream of bringing the statue to life has come true. Peter Lorre played the character brilliantly and, although, with its oft-used mad-doctor premise, this movie could have turned into something MST3K grade with a bad actor in it as Gogol, it's a thrilling psychodrama (if you'll disregard some of the sillier elements of the plot).8/10. Although I wax poetic about Lorre's performance, Drake's and Clive's just weren't all that spectacular to me. Otherwise, an excellent and entertaining movie that I recommend highly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not overlong and all good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A gem of a film all the way. Well shot with fine angled and atmospheric views, great dialogue and super acting, particularly from Peter Lorre. His finest film? I'm sure he would not like it said but it is hard to imagine how his performance could have been bettered. The slight problem, I guess, is that his performance is so full of nuance and so successful at getting our sympathy that we find ourselves routing for him against the supposed heroine played by Frances Drake. Although Lorre is supposed to be the weird and horrifying, evil one it is indeed the manipulative and seemingly cold Drake we feel like hissing at. All the scenes are good but the opening ones on the train with the pen and at the theatre are stand outs but the sequences with the creepy transplanted hands and mannequin are also very good. Not overlong and all good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LORRE'S HANDS DO IT AGAIN!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Lorre started out in Hungary as the child-like, child-killer of M 1931, which was Fritz Lang's first talkie. Peter Lorre made a repeat performance in MAD LOVE 1935 which type-cast him into roles beneath his acting abilities like the "Beast of Five Fingers". Hollywood loved his creepy actions and of course, the poached eyes that seemed to roll in his head. Dr Gogol sure uses his hands once again on Stephen Orlac, the concert pianist. Lorre has always been among the great actors who was under-rated!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember really enjoying this movie. Peter Lorre is also great in M. This is a very good horror movie. It is no doubt without parallel at its time although other movies like Caligari was also very good. Horror movies at that time was not exclusively American nor European. However, American horror movies like Lugosi in Dracula and the Frankenstein version was very popular. On the other hand, there were Jewish films such as the one about Golem. It was a great time for horror movies and Mad Love is one of the best. It is a great love story and a very fine horror movie. Watch it. M is definitely also worth watching especially for the amazing scene where the character presents his splendid defense where it is obvious that he is "innocent".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very creepy as long as you can watch old movies without laughing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to be able to watch old movies without laughing to appreciate the creepiness of "Mad Love." It was directed by the Czech-born German Karl Freund and very clearly reflects the style of the early German Gothic films such as "The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari," "Dracula," and Freund's own German silent "The Golem." "Mad Love," an MGM product, was much more in the vein of Universal's horror genre, which was heavily influenced by the German tradition because so many German directors moved to Hollywood in the Twenties. Look at the sets in this movie: They are dark, close and ominous, very much in the Universal horror tradition adopted by James Whale in films such as "Frankenstein" and "The Old Dark House." This film is part of another (you should excuse the expression) distinguished tradition. It is one of several based on a seemingly indestructible French novel, "Les Mains d'Orlac," ("The Hands of Orlac") written by Maurice Renard. First was a 1924 silent film adaptation, 'Orlac Hande', starring Werner Kraus and Colin Clive (yes, Dr. Frankenstein). Clive reprised his role as Stephen Orlac in 'Mad Love', in which the Werner Kraus role was taken over by Peter Lorre in his U.S. film debut. He plays brilliant but twisted surgeon Dr. Gogol, who is obsessed with Yvonne Orlac, a beautiful actress and the wife of renowned pianist Stephen Orlac. Although Dr. Gogol's intense devotion frightens Yvonne, she pleads for his help when her husband's hands are mutilated in a gruesome train wreck. Dr. Gogol emergently grafts the hands of a recently executed murderer onto the ends of the pianist's arms. The operation is a success, but Stephen Orlac has a bad feeling about his new hands and his suspicions are confirmed in a series of unsettling incidents involving knives. In the 1940 Boris Karloff vehicle "Before I Hang," a crusading doctor is transfused with the blood of a murderer, and he is transformed into a Jekyll-and-Hyde character who can't control his murderous outbursts. Then there was 'The Hands of Orlac' (1960) with Mel Ferrer and a low-budget 1962 version entitled 'Hands of a Stranger' featuring Sally Kellerman in an early screen appearance. A much more recent (and awful) movie, 'Body Parts', was based on yet another French novel, 'Choice Cuts' ('Et Mon Tout Est Un Homme') (1965) by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac, which apparently won an award (go figure). In that turkey, psychologist Bill Chrushank (Jeff Fahey) loses his right arm in a car accident, the arm of an executed death row inmate is grafted on in its place. The arm works, but mild-mannered, loving family man Bill discovers that the arm is possessed by a force he cannot control. Mark (Peter Murnik) has the murderer's legs, and Remo (Brad Dourif) has the murderer's other arm. Their limbs are also "possessed" by the spirit of the murderer, whose head has been transplanted onto a different body. Now, with the help of the surgeon who wrought this monstrosity, he wants his body parts back so he can reconstitute himself.You don't have to be a transplant surgeon to realize that this genre of film depends on conveniently ignoring two fundamental principles: First, without the appropriate immunosuppressants, a body will reject a tissue or organ transplanted into or onto it even if the tissue match is near-perfect. And second, of course, behavior originates in the brain, not in a hand or arm or blood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visual 10 Acting 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great cameraman Karl Freund (METROPOLIS, THE LAST LAUGH, I LOVE LUCY, etc. etc.) tries directing in this involving, well-put together remake of the German silent film, THE HANDS OF ORLAC.Freund's direction of the visuals -- framing, lighting, composition, etc. -- is OUTSTANDING. The use of Caligariesque sets and lighting, especially in the doctor's house, is wonderfully subtle and effective. Freund loads the film with inventive visual touches.The problems are the clumsy comic relief and the cast, who appear to have gotten very little help from the director. The hokey overacting of the leading lady is the worst, but other players ham it up too, indulging in every bad-acting cliche of the period. Lorre is good, but not nearly as good as he was in other films. It's really too bad, because with better acting, this could have been one of the greatest horror pictures ever.It's still very much worth seeing more than once for its visual flair and inspired details.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An odd side note ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, after many years of desiring a viewing, I had a chance to see this just before Halloween -- thanks to Turner Classic Movies (paired with the classic "M") -- and while I could echo previous comments lauding Lorre's performance and the many fine aspects of the film, there's one matter I don't believe anyone has addressed in this forum. And that is how "The Hands of Orlac" plays a recurrent role as a motif in one of the great novels of the 20th century, "Under the Volcano," by Malcolm Lowry. If you haven't read it, I recommend that you do. Then watch the fine 1984 film version of that novel by John Huston, starring Albert Finney. Let me also take this chance to applaud TCM's continuing use of the smooth, erudite Robert Osborne as host. Is there anyone better today at this role? Which makes me wonder: What ever has become of the equally adept Bob Dorian?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of "Golden Era" films, particular sci-fi/horror as well as Noir, I was very disappointed by this under-achievement.With a potentially great concept and an adequate cast, it is one of the poorest acted and directed movie of the era. Lorre is his usual creepy self but still wasted by a less than adequate one-dimensional script and direction that was totally flat.Any fan of the genre and of Lorre must be disappointed.</fullReview>
