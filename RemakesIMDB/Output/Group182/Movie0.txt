		<shortDescription>So there's something to be said for remakes after all...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people who see L.A. Takedown nowadays will see it for one reason: the fact that director Michael Mann remade this as Heat starring Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino in the Alex McArthur and Scott Plank roles. And that is basically the only reason why you would want to see this, unless you're an avid fan of '80 cop shows (there's even an detective-on-the-prowl-style montage).When you watch this as I did (after seeing the brilliant Heat) you'll be pretty surprised by how much of L.A. Takedown went into Heat. From the opening heist to that famous coffeebar scene, a lot in both movies is identical, from characters to dialogue to camera angles. Most differences between both films are actually additions (which, of course, make Heat a good hour longer than L.A. Takedown). The Chris Shehirlis character (Val Kilmer in Heat) is basically an extra in L.A. Takedown as is the getaway driver for the bank robbery. Ah yes, the bank robbery. It's present here too, although of course, it doesn't last for nearly fifteen minutes (try three). Then whole subplots from Heat (for instance the one featuring Vincent Hanna's daughter) are absent and the ending is quite different, causing L.A. Takedown to lack the almost epic feel of Heat. Still, a lot of what is L.A. Takedown went on to become Heat.And that's why L.A. Takedown merits viewing; to see how this film evolved from a cheaply made, averagely entertaining TV pilot show to what may just be the crime movie of the nineties. Many of the differences concerning the script I've already mentioned. The other main differences lie in acting and direction. To say that someone named Scott Plank (yes, plank) is not up there with Al Pacino is hardly surprising. But Plank is really pretty embarassing in this, coming across as someone who's copying crap TV-show acting like that from shows such as Hunter or Miami Vice. Even more embarassing is McArthur, who doesn't succeed in bringing any of his character's complexity to light (his character is actually pretty well developed in the script, which makes McArthur 'performance' even worseand it's the only character whose name was changed for Heat - don't ask me why). The rest of the cast isn't even worthy of comparison with their Heat counterparts.As for directing, L.A. Takedown actually lookes pretty good, given that's it's a cheap TV movie. As said, some camerawork is very literally repeated in Heat (the opening heist is just one example), but L.A. Takedown is more coloured than Heat. Heat may be very stylised, the reality aspect of it was never looked over. In L.A. Takedown the stylism is present, but the realism takes a back seat, as dark streets and dim lights convey the traditional view of L.A. as a seedy place. But although the technical brilliance of Heat's cinematographer Dante Spinotti is clearly missed, L.A. takedown is visually not that bad.In short: L.A. Takedown is not a good movie, and by itself not even remarkable. It is however a very interesting companion to Heat and both movies combined show that what you should remake is bad movies with unused potential, not good movies.Rating: 4/10 (Heat: 9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LA Takedown = Mann's blueprint for Heat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the original version of what we now know as the modern classic Heat. If you watch LA Takedown and Heat, you will see many of the scenes paralleled. LA Takedown is not a great movie, but it does make an interesting companion to its superior counterpart. Worth watching for this reason alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing wrong with this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is basically the same movie as HEAT. To say that this movie is garbage and that HEAT is a masterpiece is plain stupid, but that's almost how the IMDB users voted. Last time I checked this movie had an average rating of 5.7 while HEAT had 7.8. Anyway I don't need any Pacino or De Niro to recognize a good movie. HEAT might be a little better but it's not THAT much better. Had I seen this movie first I don't know if I had bothered seing HEAT, but sadly the big remakes get all the attention. Soon the remake of another excellent movie "manhunter" will come up in the theatres, and it will probably make people forget about how good the original is and if there are people that still haven't seen it, they will only see the remake. I don't think you should do remakes of movies that are less than 20 or 30 years old. I think I'm against almost any remake. If the original is good then why do a remake? and if it's bad well even less reason to do it...Anyway both movies are good and I like them both even if I don't like the remake phenomenon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intelligent and gutsy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>L. A. TAKEDOWN is an extremely watchable film, and has a script that is permeated by a kind of grim intelligence. The characters, far from being plastic stereotypes, actually engage on a psychological level. Michael Mann directs with considerable skill, and most tellingly, knows how to use music to maximum effect. In this respect, his ability at times almost reaches the genius level of the Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo. But main honours in this film must go to Alex McArthur who gives an amazing performance of such skill and power that he actually conveys the very thoughts and feelings of his character through body language or facial expression. The scene where the two protagonists (the hoodlum and the cop) have coffee together is almost faultless in conveying the powerful emotions and tensions that are at work between them, as well as the mind-set which motivates each of the characters, and, for once, the various love scenes are convincing and important to the development of the narrative. Interestingly too, (although it perhaps happened by default since it was a film made for television), the actual violence that is a necessary part of the story is rendered perhaps even more powerfully by NOT being shown, or by happening off-camera. But to my mind, the film belongs to Alex McArthur who turns in one of the best acting performances I have seen in a very long time, which is able to make you both loathe and feel pity for his character at one and the same time. No mean feat!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One might think that this is by far inferior to Heat, the second attempt Mann got at this story, with a larger budget, longer running time and better(and definitely more well-known) actors. Comparisons are impossible to avoid, due to how well-known, popular, and, frankly, excellent the latter of these versions is. And yes, it is greater than this; Michael learned from his experiences making this one, and having watched one of these doesn't mean that it's a waste of time to pursue the other one, no, quite the opposite. And this isn't anywhere near as poor as could be feared or maybe even expected. The performances are nicely done, in a lot of the cases. The male leads do well, and are good casting choices, and that extends beyond those two. Yes, you can tell that this was produced for TV, but it's not as bad as with other movies of that type. The action is pretty decent. This gets some of the drama, and does actually develop characters on both sides of the law. The cinematography and editing are well-done. Pacing is fair. This is only 90 minutes, so about half of what the '95 effort is, and thus can't manage the same level of complexity. Meanwhile, it does well with what it's got. The DVD has biographies and a trailer. I recommend this to anyone who has or is considering watching the famed remake of this. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved L.A. Takedown and would give it a 9 or 10 but I grade tough ... Heat was a fine remake with much more accomplished actors; itself a tribute to Alex Mc Arthur &amp; Hanna ... Deniro and Pacino copied them, imagine how that feels for 2 good actors ... I saw the original as a repeat and Heat many years after it was shot ... never saw either one again by happenstance ... I prefer the original for being more realistic although it did feature a team of designer detectives who matched their glasses and ties with their suits as if they were pharmaceutical salesmen calling on plastic surgeons instead of cops rousting thugs all day ... Heat was even more fashion runway conscious which took it down a peg for me but it remains a good action cops &amp; robbers yarn ... I see where some posters rap Alex for being too wooden but I found that realistic ... playing it flat is correct for guys who can look right through you and spend their days planning ways to blast apart steel and concrete barriers to O.P.M... they tend to be as dry and cold as ice and not very colorful or expressive ... I did a fair amount of police reporting and cops always told me that many true professional criminals will fool you in the sense that they look and comport themselves as if they were the assistant manager of the local Burger King ... LA Takedown had some dialogue that still rings in my ears and reflects the intensely selfish and myopic perspective of the true habitual career criminal such as Alex explaining his accidental victims to his girlfriend that "it rains, people get wet" and the renegade member of the heist team exclaiming to himself as he spins to plunge a hunting knife into a prostitute that "I'm a stone cold, sky blue killer" .. I thank other posters for pointing out the many similarities but I saw no reference to the very different endings ... we have the drama of the airport shootout in Heat to Alex getting blasted by the psycho through a hotel door in LA Takedown and telling Hanna "they just don't make doors like they used to" as he dies in his arms ... perfect last words for an exceptionally practical, emotionless man</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misjudged Genre Changer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK so I'd probably have given this a 9 but felt the rating was disproportionately low and no doubt reflects Heat fans deliberately rating this down to show partisan support for their beloved Heat, rather than because they actually disliked this movie that much. Just a hunch! It's amazing to me how easily people will be polarised on a trivial issue. It's the same director FFS! What's the point of blindly hating one and adoring the other. It's not a football match.Forgetting about the bloody remake for a minute, you've got try to imagine this movie framed in the context of 1989. It was re-inventing an extremely tired genre with a brand new style. Rather than lazily re-hashing the hackneyed cops good/crooks evil template, it attempted to give a believable account of how a specialist team of cops and a serious crew of crooks operated on different sides of the same coin. It tries to make you sympathise with both sides which was *incredibly* rare back then. It introduced shockingly believable and cold violence which was even rarer.Whatever you make of this now, you need to at least acknowledge that it would've been ground breaking and original when it came out, and lets face it, that there would have been no Heat if it weren't for this.When I bought this on DVD 10 years or so ago I noticed a couple of things that may have contributed to the bad reviews.First of all there was the appalling quality of the DVD recording - that really takes a lot away from the style of the movie and that's just unfortunate. Maybe down to bad storage or just a cheap pressing of the DVD.Secondly was how dated it looked. OK so Michael Mann's original batch of 80s movies/TV series were never going to age well because they whole-heartedly celebrated 80s fashion, design, architecture, language and style. This worked so well on screen back then. The zeitgeist of the 80s was brutally different to what had preceded it - a bold industrial/chic/sanitised re-imagining of a stale flower power, earthy world. Some rejected it, others embraced it. Among those who embraced it were movie directors like Michael Mann, and John Hughes. Sure, 5 or 6 fashion fads later and it looks dated and ridiculous. Well guess what, that's exactly what those guys made of the 60s/70s fashions that they were rejecting and that's what the next batch will make of fashion now and so on and so on. That's no reason to close the door on art produced in a particular era. You've got to think bigger than that or you're going to miss out on some amazing old movies.There's a hell of a lot in the very well written dialogue which beautifully captures the values of the time it was made, e.g. "I'm a heavy hitter, I travel in circles, you know, like strata, strata at the top see? Cos I have access to some of the most precious commodity on Earth - information, data." If it sounds corny now, well remember it sounded sharp back then.Very few people agree with this but I honestly preferred the original Scott Plank and Alex McArthur as the cop/crook. I thought they were much more believable in those roles than the aging DeNiro and Pacino. DeNiro gave it his best but if I had to guess which out of him and McArthur had been inside serving time, I'd go with McArthur every time - he comes over as a very convincing psychopath who could kick off at any moment. As for Pacino, I think he was having a bit of laugh with his character in Heat to be honest - "...great ass" etc. Scott Plank was actually convincing as an ex marine turned cop capable of sprinting down the street hauling an assault rifle and after a crew that had taken down a bank.I also prefer Vincent Guastaferro to Sizemore as the driver, and Xander Berkeley has to be better as the weaselly, desperate, wannabe tough guy Waingro. The guy in Heat was way too tough and mean looking to play that part.Sure so more money's going to lead to tighter production, better music, better effects etc. No brainer. But in terms of capturing the spirit of the story, the locations, the characters &amp; the interplay between them, LA Takedown wins for me.I do like Heat in its own right, but I will always prefer LA Takedown because it was the original and it is steeped in the time it was intended for. Just like I'll always infinitely prefer the 1964 Ford Mustang to the current remake even though it should always lose on paper. It's about originality, class, and the spirit of the era that went into it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say, this original 'Heat' where the remake was more universal with bigger name actors and went into more of the character's lives, whatever, still didn't disappoint. It actually went higher than my expectations, and this being a Michael Mann film too, I should of known better, leading me to wonder that this lower profile 'Heat' pic surely didn't deserve the obscurity it must of had, sitting on the video shelves for years. The two leads are excellent, which again, had me underestimating it, especially McCarthur's performance of our A1 solid professional thief/robber, who he plays straight serious right down the line. I enjoyed him much more than seeing De Niro doing it to be frank. When seeing Pacino do hot shot dick, Hanna, in the remake, Plank, an actor who sadly isn't with us anymore, where I had seen him in some other stuff is far different, from Pacino, his interpretation here I found, mystifyingly exciting, where he brought something with it too. He's definitely someone you don't toy with, as by example in a few scenes, one I thought was hilariously cool like it's leads. I'd rather opt to watch these two than the actor duo in the 96 remake. From the word go, it's typical Michael Mannish, his signature all over this pic, those cool music scores, I never get sick of. That infamous café scene with the antagonist and protagonist, engaged me so much, especially McCarthur again, that same dialogue exchange between the two was beautiful interaction. But what was more engaging, was the pre moment to this scene where outside the coffee house, both parties, who happen to cross paths, are about to draw their guns. Plank smooths the waters, by offering to buy him coffee. The bank shootout/botched job scene was loudly intense, those deafening AK's bringing back the glimpse of a horrid memory, also from 96. Okay, if you've seen Heat like me first, you might be thinking, "Yeah so"? where there's a lot, I mean a lot of identic stuff in this, but remember, this is the original, that inspired the mega hit. Still, this comes off as a success, an underestimated surprise, with a few small differences, what have you, which is remake law, except for 'Funny Games'. Don't let this one slip by, folks, for the two cool leads, and that wonderful Mann direction, which in some ways is unsurpassable, always involving us, where we're part of film too, thanks to this master.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Essentially a dry run for 'Heat', a modern classic that I find pretty dull; but even at half the length 'L.A. Takedown' is twice as boring. There isn't much time to set up the characters, so Scott Plank (tee hee) and Alex McArthur aren't too convincing as the cop and the crook, respectively, and there isn't much tension between them.This isn't the film's fault, but I couldn't help comparing it to 'Heat' and ticking off which characters were played by other actors in the superior version. Plank and McArthur in this one, Pacino and DeNiro in the redo - you can't really compete with that, can you? The famous shootout and confrontation scenes are present and correct but pack nothing like the same punch. It's a footnote of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense, controlled and very enjoyable thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw a clip of this Michael Mann 1989 TV movie on a video clips website, and it served to remind me just how much I'd loved owning this film on VHS years back. I'm going to seek it out on DVD, and you can keep "Heat" ? for which this is the precursor ? I won't envy you a jot. I don't care how good De Niro and Pacino are, I don't care how interesting (or not) are the lives of the supporting characters, I don't care how much better quality the later film may have been: there's just a zinging energy about "LA Takedown" ? something really, really taut, pushing and exciting that seems absolutely of its time, absolutely right for the story ? so much so that it's "Heat" that now seems out of time.The two leads ? Scott Plank's fearless cop Vincent and Alex McArthur's isolated career criminal Patrick ? should be singled out for particular praise in a generally well-cast movie. Some reviewers have said they think the performances are hammy: I disagree. I think they're misunderstanding a sharp, dramatic script which is punchy, spare, to the point ? much like the two lead characters themselves. Vincent and Patrick's memorable coffee shop meeting is extraordinarily tense and dynamic: their controlled exteriors masking fierce intensity. Their rapid-fire exchanges reveal nothing and everything: Vincent the live wire, excited by the criminality he chases down even as he does so systematically; Patrick the warrior-monk, alone with his rigid samurai code. He speaks slowly and clearly, and to me it isn't ham: it's that he doesn't want a single thing around him to be misunderstood. But even he can't control everything. In many ways this is 1980s film noir - in classic noir style, there must of course be a woman in the background, to affect the course of events.This is definitely David to the Goliath of "Heat", but I highly recommend it. Don't listen to that other lot ? "Heat" is bloated and over-long by comparison to this tight project.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watched because of Heat - it's a footnote in film history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a bad film at all on its own merits. Essentially 95% of the scenes in this movie were made almost exactly the same in Heat (with Heat have much more character detail hence its longer run time). But knowing Heat is a remake of this, makes this film a very interesting footnote in film history. There is no way to not compare the actors performances in both films.Of course, it's hard to be compared to a role Al Pacino ended up doing. You will lose. But worse, Scott Plank here was just miscast anyway. He doesn't appear to be a bad actor - he's too young to be leading this task force and looks like the "porno version" of the character Pacino played. He plays the character like a bad TV cop show cop and that's the huge negative of this otherwise pretty good movie.I found Mann's direction no where near as good in this as in Heat. Plus it was made when Miami Vice was still on there air so this is almost like a West Coast version of Miami Vice. But overall not bad at all. And being it was remade by a film many people consider to be one of their all time favorites, this little TV movie will always have a remembered spot in film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stands up well next to Heat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's impossible to talk about this film in isolation from Mann's second, more successful attempt. They are almost identical films by virtue of the script, although there is different emphasis at given moments. Heat is a better film; it has the all the administrative advantages of coming after this one as well as better actors and a larger budget.Yet L.A. Takedown stands up well. Scott Plank (Hanna/Pacino) and Alex Arthur (Patrick McClaren/de Niro) are well cast, even adopting the same mania/iceberg opposed mannerisms as the more famous incumbents of the role. The raw existential despair that is the undoing of the two characters stays in the script but hasn't translated quite as well onto the screen - Laura Harrington's Eady says 'lonely' but doesn't look it, like Amy Brenneman does. Ely Pouget is an honest, worldly woman like Diane Venore though.There's one minor loose end but that's it really. We still get the trademark bleached look, set piece authenticity and soulful, LA-by-night shots that Mann likes. A fairly good thriller in its own right but a deeply fascinating one to watch in tandem with Heat. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heat is an excellent film but I was always disappointed with the end; I thought the De Niro character wouldn't just blindly run from Pacino - he would have waited for him and shot him down, surely? Takedown, which is almost scene-for-scene and line-for-line the same as Heat, has a better ending I think, more true to the De Niro character anyway.Having just watched the two films within a day of each other, it is amazing how close they are; even down to the cut-aways, close-ups and zooms. The scene in the diner and then outside when Waingrow is about to get shot but disappears is identical in everyway, as is the scene when Patrick/Neil meets the girl when reading a book (except in Takedown she designs album covers and in Heat it's CD covers!)</fullReview>

When I saw it was by Michael Mann I recorded it on VHS. It was the 80s, and the drama was intense for TV viewing. Adding cursing and more violent action does not make it better. And the version I viewed online as Crimewave was a reworking of the TV movie. You can't compare a TV movie to a Theatrical remake. The budget was bigger, more grandiose and high profile actors. I like the bank robbery version of the TV version. Two big name actor in the remake doesn't make it better. You can't compare an apple to an orange. It's like comparing Michael Rennie's Cyborg 2087 to the Terminator. Same storyline presented differently. I prefer L.A. Takedown to Heat. The same concept on two different mediums.

Mann does very well in these circumstances by making sure there is an excellent story. He draws solid performances from Alex McArthur as MacLaren, and the late Scott Plank as the dedicated detective Hanna.The story is well set out, with an excellent opening sequence. It builds well as we see Hanna work to hone in on the McLaren character. It also interesting to see how the protagonist and antagonist bond despite the fact they are opposite side of the law.

This is much better than HEAT, even though HEAT by itself is a great movie and has a very impressive shoot out seen.

		<shortDescription>Not as polished as Heat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recap: A professional gang of robbers take down an armored car, killing the three guards in the process, in a spectacular way. This gets the attention of Vincent Hanna and his team on Robbery and Homicide. With some luck they get a lead on one of the robbers and soon they have the gang staked out. But they have no evidence and must catch them in the act. The robbers themselves starts to feel the heat, but still decide to do one last bank job, one that would get them enough money to vanish and retire. But Hanna is one their heels and a lethal showdown is held on the streets of LA.Comments: I know, it's not fair to compare movies. Movies should be measured and judged based on themselves. And especially it's not fair to compare a movie with classic and personal favorite Heat (1995). But in this case, it is inevitable. And actually a little interesting to see how the story has evolved since Michael Mann is responsible for both direction and script on both movies. The stories are very similar, not very surprising as Heat is a remake of LA Takedown (LA T).But there are a few key elements that makes Heat into a classic and LA T into "just" a good movie. First off, the actors in LA T are good, but they are not Pacino, De Niro, Kilmer or any of the other stars. As the dialog in many cases is identical it is easy to see that LA T cast can't deliver the same lines with quite the same intensity, suspense and emotion. Still, I want to emphasize that the LA T cast is good, especially the meeting between Hanna and McLaren is good. Another key difference is that the characters are much younger in LA T and hence not having acquired the experience and history and family that enriches Heat. And this is maybe the biggest difference of all. Heat is clearly much more thought through and analyzed, which is natural since it is the second try. Subplots are few in LA T, characters abruptly introduced and forgotten with no or few clues to their connection to the story. Those subplots are much more explored in Heat, and we get a broad complex view. In LA T the scene is simple and sometimes confusing from lack of explanation.Still some scenes are worth a good look. The mentioned meeting above is one. The (in Heat classical) shootout is very good also. But one does miss the depth of the characters, their personal history. Still, in itself a good movie, and very interesting to watch as comparison to Heat.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps Mann should take me out to breakfast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a preliminary draft to "Heat", Mann's made-for-TV crime drama about a gung-ho cop and a professional criminal works. It lays the foundation for the bigger-budget film in which Pacino and De Niro hone their chops, but as a stand alone film ? "LA Takedown" (or as I watched it "Made in LA") is a dated, censored look at a bigger picture. Having watched "Heat" first, and several times over, it is difficult not to make comparisons between the two films. It is reminiscent of watching the original "Gaslight" and the remake produced just four years later ? while in that case the original is better ? one cannot help but compare the differences. That is the case with Mann's TV outing. While it is impressive to see that Mann stuck with his original story, it is the characters that fail to live up to the "Heat" hype. Scott Plank and Alex McArthur are good actors, but they are no icons. Their squabble between each other seems staged, less emotional, and not quite as tense as seen in the later film. McArthur isn't as smart, Plank isn't as gruff, and what makes it work in "Heat" is the back story Mann creates. The world surrounding our characters in "Heat" makes them believable, more than just characters on a page ? while in this film, running at just an hour and a half, it is difficult to believe each character's squabbles. Both films are a character driven film, with two intense scenes of action, but without the characters, we couldn't have created the moments. I believe Mann realized that with "LA Takedown", and it is why "Heat" seems to focus more intently on our players.Again, I am not one that likes to say one is obviously better than the other, but when looked out separately, "LA Takedown" would feel dated, tired, and confusing. It isn't a film to be remembered, which is why it probably hasn't been transferred to DVD yet, and perhaps forgotten for good. "Heat" takes every lacking element in this original draft and powerfully re-masters it using stronger actors, other plot lines, and a clear definition of "why".Overall, I liked this original film merely for the idea. The concept that was finally redefined as "Heat" is perhaps not quiet as welcomed in 1989, but "LA Takedown" could not be watched again. In the catalogue of Mann films, it is important to see, but it is not as emotionally powerful or kinetically charged as "Heat". With an unfocused story and minimal character development (with plenty of yelling ? a classic 80s answer to building tension), "LA Takedown" doesn't give hope for the early made-for-TV movie, but it does showcase Mann's ideas. As a teacher, I would ask Mann to rewrite and develop further, and with his answer as being "Heat", the project would then be complete.Watch this film once, but upgrade yourself accordingly.Grade: ** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the remake!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is a far better film than its rating suggests, in point of fact it is superior in many ways to the remake HEAT. The movie rests solely on the performances of the actors and the writer/director rather than on any star attractions or hype (pacino and De Nero have both made far better films and put in far better performances). There are a few good set pieces in here and a myriad of fine acting performances from both the leads and the supporting cast. The fact that the re-make was relatively faithful to the original is in itself a bit of a homage and where the two films really differ is in the action sequences that overtake the story in the remake, if you want to watch a more intelligent and somewhat darker crime thriller then I recommend this before HEAT every time this should be given the credit it deserves as it was pieces like this that have allowed Mann to make a lot of the mainstream pulp films he is famous for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT "scene-for-scene the same as Heat"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has the same basic plot outline as Heat and MOST of the same characters, but is in NO WAY "scene-for-scene the same as Heat." The acting is absolutely atrocious and some of the scenes make no sense without some of the setup Heat has. I can understand why these actors haven't gone on to much beyond this movie -- THEY'RE AWFUL!!!!! Some of the storyline is just implausible and downright silly. I can also fully understand why this isn't available on DVD here in North America (the quality of this film is akin to what you might see on late night local television). However, if you're a die-hard Michael Mann fan, as am I, you should still see this, because it because it shows how much development he puts into a story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Heat" draft</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I'm a fan of "Heat" I took the time to watch the preliminary material which Michael Mann created after long-lasting struggle to make his dream movie come true. Mann decided that he waited enough for a big-time production and to use this great script for TV release with the intention to continue it to a TV series.But, let's get to the point...1. Pros:1.1 I've read the 1994 revision of the script, which included unrealized shots and dialogue in the 1995's "Heat". The good thing about "L.A. Takedown" is that you have the chance to see some of those good lines and additional storyline, which serves as a bonus to what you already saw in "Heat". 1.2. Directing was very decent, but anyway I wouldn't recognize it that Mann stays behind it if I didn't knew already.1.3 You can see the growth from the original version to the remake as Heat. Comparing LA Takedown to Heat you can recognize the development and decisions which Mann took in order to make "Heat" such a classic that it is.2. Cons: 2.1 Poor Cast &amp; Acting. Since it is TV low budget movie I guess we couldn't expect more but this was some "piece of work". Hanna's character was developed Okay, but that's all. Patrick McLaren (a.k.a. Neil in Heat) was a complete nightmare, it doesn't correspond to the image you can visualize in the script. I know that the benchmark is too high having such a great cast for Heat - comparison is out of the question.. Nevertheless those wanna-be actors on LA Takedown doesn't even deserve to be chosen for a porn movie with a storyline...3. Bottom line: if you are a fan of "Heat" and Michael Mann - see it for the above mentioned pros.. It's like looking at the draft of Mona Lisa or some other masterpiece - so it is kinda of interesting... If you are not a fan - then it is a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than HEAT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the exact same story as the movie HEAT staring Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Val Kilmer. The primary difference between LA Takedown and HEAT is the fact that LA Takedown doesn't drag on for 172 minutes. Even though it was a made for TV movie, it had a great plot, the actors did a great job, and it was much more fast paced when compared to HEAT. I still have it on video from when I videotaped it the first time it was on TV. I own HEAT on DVD, but if given the choice I would rather watch LA Takedown. I highly recommend it if you have an opportunity to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In some ways superior to "Heat"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got a hold of a copy of this (deliberately?) forgotten made-for-TV film. A busted NBC pilot, it was remade by Michael Mann six years later with major studio backing and high-calibre star support. Gotta give Mann some credit,few filmmakers would have the gall to bother with such an effort. "Heat" is a scene-for-scene, frame-by-frame remake, so watching this was a lot of fun. LAT is sort of a scrappier kid brother version to the elegant, but soulless remake. Its far more frenzied/hyper. It has the look and feel of a William Friedkin film. (Mann has got the carreer Freidkin deserves) And it oozes with late 80s styles and fashion. The performances are fine, especially the two leads. At least they're more naturalistic and less self conscious than the DeNiro/Pacino team. Action wise, LAT holds out well to its bloated remake, including the bank shootout. This film even shows a little more concern for the "collateral damage" (i.e cops and civilians) than '95 version. Not a masterpiece, but a very good action flik with heart and moxie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant - better than Heat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw L.A. Takedown before I saw Heat. Heat is not a scratch on L.A. Takedown. Alex McArthur was brilliant as Patrick. There was hardly any foul language in L.A. Takedown, but with Deniro and Pacino, it was every other word. Heat is a third rate film, L.A. Takedown is a first rate film. I'm hunting to find L.A. Takedown on Video, if I come across a copy of Heat, I'll use it for packaging. It was rubbish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>L.A Takedown(1989); Superior To Heat(1995)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It makes me want to laugh! By the comments here stating that Heat(1995) is some kind of masterpiece it makes me want to cringe! Between Al Pacino's "Hammy" Acting mimicking Scott Planks lines in L.A Takedown to Robert DeNiro's speaking Alex McArthur's lines very badly!! If L.A Takedown didn't come first Heat would not be the film it was, and the supporting performances in L.A Takedown are also spectacular from Vincent Gustaferro to Peter Dobson, and Michael Rooker and Ely Pouget, with Xander Berkely and Cary Tagawa Don't trash this fine film because you can't find it on home video, just realize that out of your own laziness you don't have a copy because you just don't care!! L.A Takedown(****) Out Of (****) Heat(*) Out Of (****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another low budget film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason why you have heard of this film is that people compare it with HEAT and say its the same. The truth is that the only thing simular to HEAT is the director and the story as in a cop vs bank robber.HEAT was an unbelievable film with the right amount of action and story to keep you at the edge of your seat like Goodfellas. This film on the other hand is complete rubbish, if your lucky you'll forget it the next day.OK! a few scenes are simular to HEAT but wheres the action and exploring of the characters. Thats why HEAT was so good it explored the characters which made you like them all.Another thing about this film is that you notice the location and lighting and its obviou it doesn't go..... i mean the location and lighting for some of the scenes were so bad that it makes you wonder maybe i should have been a director or a camera-man.This film is totally crap and those people who compare it to HEAT are wrong to do so...... HEAT is in another league..... u watch this film ur wastin ur time........ Good job its not as long as HEAT ! HA !</fullReview>
