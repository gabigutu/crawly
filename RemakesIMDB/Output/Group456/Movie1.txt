		<shortDescription>The Worst Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My God. Having watched all of the three french prequels I have to say I was a bit skeptical right from the start, but this is pure madness. Being able to shred such a great movie as "Taxi" into this horrible excuse for a film is beyond me. There are no humor, no story, no acting and no action. It lacks everything you want from this types of films. I have to say that if you were able to see the whole movie in 5 minutes, it wouldn't be worth the time. If you're thinking of seeing this movie and haven't seen the french one, please, do yourself a favor. See the original.And if any of your friends claims that this movie is worth seeing, he or she is not. Believe in me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak remake of 3 classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the American version of the French Taxi films and it suffers in comparison.I'm not kidding when I say that this a remake of the three French films since although the film is mainly a poor remake of the the first film, it lifts sequences from the second and third films. Its a mess, a real mess. I'm a huge huge fan of the French films, and for me there was no real point in my seeing this since anything that worked came from the originals. Why did they bother? They changed the sex of the lead (though the Queen is excellent), combined others and rewrote the cops mother to the point of stupidness. They lost any sense of timing and connection...they should have started from the ground up.Its not the painfully awful film that some reviews made it out to be, but it is a waste of time. If you can find the originals and watch those. That should take you the better part of 5 hours and in the end you will not feel as though you've wasted your life.3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And just to make sure you get it right, i'll repeat myself: Watch the french original! It's so much better, starting from the cast (Queen Latifah is so miscast, it hurts), straight to the story/humor (it's just not right)! The best scene (to at least have one good comment about the title) is a scene involving Jennifer Esposito and Gisele Bündchen, which had a sort of "tension" to it, that was funny and sexy at the same time! Funnily (or maybe not so funny) enough, with the cast here, you'd be excused to think that it would be more often like that. But it's neither funny nor sexy ... and I'm not talking at the same time, at all! Except the one scene ... but that doesn't save the movie, which just is too long and has nothing going for it! It's a shame, because Jimmy Fallon can be funny, but here he's just annoying!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cheap rip-off of a classic french comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Avoid this film at all costs! This is just a very very cheap remake of the french movie by the same name. Being a big fan of that Taxi, I was intrigued to see what the Yanks had done with it. Watching it was painful, the only reason I watched till the end was to see how low they were going to go with this film. Queen Latifa's performance is the only redeeming aspect of this film, who does her best with an unoriginal, crass and cheap script. The best scenes are direct rip-offs of the original film and Jimmy Fallon is wasted on a one dimensional ridiculous character.Go see the original french film and give this one as wide a berth as you can!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like Roger Ebert once stated about a movie, I'll use his words to state this one: (This movie)isn't even the bottom of the barrel, it doesn't even scrape the bottom of barrel. It doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as barrels. When you have a movie where Queen Latifah is the most experienced actor in the film, you know you are in trouble.The debut appearances of Giselle and Jimmy were awful. They did not get into character and made no connection between the the audience and the movie. It surprised me that such amateur actors in the movie business (jimmy is quite good in Saturday night live) were given such large roles. Also, the whole plot was ludicrous. Brazilian supermodels robbing a bank? In New York? Yeah, right. BS. Still wanna watch this movie? Watch it at your own risk!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big budget comedy with cut-rate jokes...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slick, flashy film, a semi-remake of Luc Besson's "Taxi" from 1998, here Americanized as an urban action-comedy. Queen Latifah plays smart-mouthed cabbie with a souped-up vehicle in New York City who inadvertently partners with stumble bum cop Jimmy Fallon to crack a major crime case. Film should have relied more on Latifah's natural sass and less on Fallon's white-bread, dim-witted act (race is a constant punchline in the script, and Fallon is just there as Exhibit A). Jennifer Esposito is wonderful as a no-nonsense police lieutenant, Ann-Margret is a stitch as Fallon's tippling mother, and John Sierros (Broadway actor shamefully credited as 'Fat Cop') shines as a bamboozled police officer, but what happened to Queen Latifah? She gets a few good cracks in, but there's no character here for her to play; she sticks to her sarcastic persona and puts everyone down, but her role is depressingly one-dimensional. Comedy has a fast pace, impressive cinematography (although the swooping crane shots in traffic get repetitive) and some good car chases, but the screenplay needed an overhaul. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, this was a film that looked better in the trailers when the film was being promoted, prior to its commercial release. We just caught with it thanks to a borrowed DVD and we are so happy we didn't have to pay to watch this "masterpiece".The film, directed by Tim Story, is a rip off. It is loosely based on much better French comedies created by Luc Besson. This one here gives credit to Ben Garant as its writer."Taxi" is an exercise in how not to make movies. The casting of Jimmy Fallon for the main role was a poor judgment by whoever decided to give the comedian this plum job; he is not even funny! The opening sequence involving the undercover operation where Washburn fakes to be a Cuban mafioso, shows that Mr. Fallon needs to reconsider future appearances in films.Queen Latifah, a charismatic performer, is handicapped having to act next to an inane actor that ruins some of her best moments in the movie. Ann Margaret must have been feeling desperate when she agreed to appear in this film as the lush mother of Washburn, but on second thought, it makes perfect sense that with a son like him, drinking is the only way this woman can go through life.Watch it at your own risk!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really bad try...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>YES! This movie is a re-make of an original french movie Taxi, in case you didn't know and a pretty bad one. If you are too lazy to read subtitles, well then I guess you are better off with this us trashy version. If you are not, then get the original from 1998 with Samy Naceri and Peugeot. It is sooo much better.The problem here is that for some reason, the bank gang just had to be a bunch of out of control Russian models. Yes! Beacouse that is going to happen! This movie is just an inch from these evil mafia walking around naked, it is hardly believable at all.Plus, I am sorry, but Queen Latifah is not really convincing as a racer person and in to the car kind of a person.Sorry, folks, I say you could just put less money into dubbing the original, than throwing them away for a poor try-out. I am NOT saying all this just because I am from Europe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wait For Video</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When he loses his driver's license, an inept police officer (Jimmy Fallon) must rely on the reckless driving skills of a taxi driver who would prefer to drive race cars (Queen Latifah) to help him stop a gang of beautiful Brazilian bank robbers.The premise sounds like one of those film that are really stupid yet still kind of funny. However, it didn't really work out like that. The film wasn't a complete dud it just wasn't very funny. I wasn't surprised this film didn't do so well in theaters. The previews were weak and a lot of people don't like Jimmy Fallon. I only saw it because of Queen Latifah. Unfortunately, she couldn't save the movie. The film was just too childish and unoriginal. There were a few funny lines yet nothing that really made me laugh a lot. It starts off well but then it starts to drag and it feels a lot longer than 97 minutes. I even had low expectations because the critics murdered the movie but it was not very funny.Queen Latifah is easily the best thing about Taxi. She has a lot of charisma and she makes the film watchable. Jimmy Fallon was okay, nothing special. Sometimes he tried too hard to be funny though. For his first movie, he sure made a poor choice. He could have a successful movie career, he just needs to make better choices. Gisele Bundchen is very beautiful and she did a good job but her role didn't exactly call for a lot of acting talent. The direction was uneven and Tim Story isn't a very good director. Also, the chemistry between Latifah and Fallon just wasn't there and they didn't seem right for each other. This comedy just suffered from a weak script and weak direction. It ended up being a below average comedy and it wasn't worth watching in theaters. In the end, if you're interested in watching Taxi wait for video. Rating 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Taxi's run outta gas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TAXI is the American remake of the quirky 1998 Luc Besson comedy. While the core of the film is still oriented around fast cars, hot chicks and zany humour, the film's light-hearted French comedic ambiance has been replaced with a dirtier, more strident, and somewhat more serious American action-comedy feel, which, although it tries hard, doesn't quite translate as it should. Queen Latifah leads as Belle Williams, a taxi driver who runs a souped-up Ford around the meaner streets of the city. Jimmy Fallon plays the unco New York cop who lands in her cab one day in pursuit of a bunch of foxy Brazilian bank robbers. Together, they muddle through car-crashes, shoot-outs and weirdly-decorated apartments to bring crooks to justice. While the plot sounds like a good premise for a decent comedy, the film is sorely lacking in script composition. The one-liners are crap, the jokes feel forced, and the script, which alternates between taking itself too seriously and sheer stupidity, does no justice whatsoever to the energetic and talented cast. A major disappointment from what looked to be a brilliant film. Someone should remake it in six more years - with a little more skill, I hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor American remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm tempted to just write "This movie sucks" and then go see the original again, but that wouldn't be very helpful to you guys. Here's why this movie sucks.To sum up the movie, I steal from oshram-3 (One of the other comments) "The plot of Taxi follows Detective Washburn (Jimmy Fallon, making his debut as a movie lead) and bike-messenger-turned-cab-driver Belle (Queen Latifah) as they inadvertently get tangled up with one another and have to figure out who is ripping off a series of Manhattan banks and try to catch them. Rounding out the cast (no pun intended) are Jennifer Esposito (you might remember her from Spin City) as Washburn's lieutenant, Marta, and supermodel Gisele Bundchen as the head hot chick."Luc Besson's action-comedy Taxi(1998) was a great movie, mostly due to decent acting, funny characters and social/cultural references. In this American remake, all that is gone. The characters in themselves are severely less intricate than in Besson's original, and maybe the best of them all is gone. I am, of course, talking about the utterly insane police captain. Then again, of course the Americans would leave him out, since he's a parody of every single angry police chief in American movies. All that's left is Queen Latifah driving a taxi, and a cop that's just pathetic, and doesn't have that likable quality Frédéric Diefenthal had in the french version.Also, the political correctness really shines through the gaps in this film. Every single strong character is a woman. The only guy in the entire core group of the movie is the awkward cop/disguise artist. The movie has been carefully constructed so it doesn't lash out at any particular groups in society, and by doing that, you lose the edge.I see this movie as a blatant attempt to salvage careers and make some money on the fact that Americans don't like subtitles. It's also a classic example of what happens when you let lawyers and politically correct groups scare you out of doing things right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Fallon's Breakout!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When first seeing the trailers for this film, and people saying how good it was I immediately touted that this would be Jimmy Fallon's breakout into mainstream. It would be what Beverly Hills Cop was for Murphy. I did think Fallon could pull it off. It was only fortunate for director Tim Story that his direction and a strong supporting cast saved this film from the crap it could have been.Taxi is the story of a clumsy, completely useless cop named Washburn. His major weakness happens to be that he can't drive at all. He ends up smashing into things and causing damage every time he gets behind the wheel. His Lieutenant and former girlfriend puts him on the walk beat and he hates it. He overhears the call for a robbery in progress and jumps into Belle's cab. A smart mouthed, brilliant driver who longs to be a Nascar racer. The story continues as a group of brilliantly fast and quick changing super models rob banks. Washburn is determined to catch these master thieves to prove himself and Belle agrees to help him in order to get her cab back.The action is fast, and the chase scenes are just awesome, everything The Italian Job should have been. Latifah is amazing, she's funny, and has an amazing screen presence and makes a great action star. Even Jennifer Esposito as a supporting role as the Lieutenant is great. Even Model Gisele Bundchen, in her first movie role is the perfect bad guy and still does a better job than Fallon. He thinks he's still doing an SNL skit and he plays his role like this is supposed to be a slapstick comedy and it's not. This film is action-comedy which is very different. He blew his breakthrough role and he may regret it because this could have been great for him and for us to watch. Nonetheless Taxi is a good time because of the rest of the cast and the storyline is fast paced action. Latifah alone is worth watching. Overall worth checking out but certainly not for Fallon.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a VERY funny movie. It leaves you laughing out loud throughout. It has comedy (loads of it), action, racing, crime and a little bit of romance! Perfect mixture! Both girls and guys will love it!! Queen Latifah is her usual jolly smart-aleck self while Andy (Jimmy Fallon) steals the show with his endearing performance leaving you clutching your stomach with laughter!!! His idiocy and geeky look while the thieves are really HOT! At first I thought it was going to be boring but with the Queen in it, I expected some jokes at least. But what I got was one helluva "party" time. The movie moves fast and you get quite hooked onto it. When you feel you want more, the credits roll on.. The scriptwriter has done a great job with the dialogues. There was no much ingenuity in the whole thing but well, a movie is a movie. Thats it. And you just watch it to take your mind off stuff, laugh for awhile and relax. Taxi gives you that. It is very recently that I came to know that there were more movies whose title is "TAXI" but I have not watched them. SO, for me, this movie was good.</fullReview>

One day, she meet Andy who is policeman. He is rude but he pursue criminals with Belle. The criminals are beautiful females, but they drive a car at top speed too! So, the car chase happened.I saw this movie when I relaxed in my room. It was casual but I enjoyed it very much. I hardly see a movie which is violent, so I was very excited. The taxi remodeled beyond my imagine. The movie is violent but it has some comedy. Their talk is funny. The criminals are clever so they kept running away from police.

If you are expecting a film that could inspire you, it's probably not for you. All I can say that it is good for 2 hr of relax. Really, I couldn't think it only has a 4.3 rating on IMDb.com.I have not watched the French version, so could not compare the two. Perhaps the French one is much superior, but that would not affect my rating on the film.</fullReview>

Though predictable at times, this is a movie that you can watch when you just want to sit down and laugh. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something lighthearted and fun to watch. For being Fallon's movie debut he did a great job, so if you loved Fallon on Saturday night live, you will love this movie. Latifa also does a great job, and complemented Fallon very well, the contrast between the two characters was done very well, which in turn created some great comical moments. So to any Fallon and Latifa fans this is a great movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Come on, guys, this movie wasn't so terrible! There's no point comparing it to Besson's first two Taxi films because that's not what it's about - sure, 8 out of 10 of its content is straight from the other movies but just get past that and it's a not bad, quite sweet, sometimes funny, car-chase romp. Fallon and Latifah work pretty well on screen and the script's fairly lively. OK, the plot may be contrived and obvious but it's still worth a watch. Too many reviews on here are written by people comparing everything to past film moments - just because Star Wars was (alledgely) a great Sci-Fi movie, doesn't mean that every Sci-Fi afterwards isn't worth watching. So don't write this one off straight away - just don't take it too seriously and watch it on a lazy, rainy Saturday afternoon.</fullReview>

There are chases galore with impressive velocities . Almost all shots in which you see the taxi or other cars in the street, or car stunts performed in the streets, were really filmed in Los Angeles, not New York . It's a run-of-the-mill action-comedy film because from the beginning to the final the fast movement and amusement is nonstop . The laughters and chuckles are varied and giggles are based about diverse characters and differences among protagonists , but they are unlikeliest pals . The film is exciting and humorous at times but is also ridiculous and embarrassing . However , sometimes is fresh and diverting and on a couple of memorable occasions is hilarious . Lively and atmospheric music adjusted to action by Christophe Beck and colorful cinematography by Burberry . The movie was lavishly produced by Luc Besson (producer of the French Taxi I,II ,III..). The motion picture was regularly directed by Tin Story , though Kevin Bray was originally set to direct, but dropped out . It's a fun ride that will appeal to Queen Lafitah fans and action-comedy buffs . Rating : Below average .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taxi is the type of movie that I usually stay away from. I thought this would be a weak comedy but I laughed at quite a few scenes. This movie is not perfect by any means. This is just a movie to get cheap laughs out of.This is about a really dumb cop who teams up with a hardcore taxi driver to stop supermodels from robbing banks.The acting may be the weakest part of the film and that's cause of Jimmy Fallon. I don't think he's suited for cinema. Queen Latifah however had a great performance. The supermodels were mind-blowing hot.Overall, this is a good movie that people should try to enjoy.

The jokes are all terrible and Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah are so awful in this it is unbelievable. Jimmy Fallon is especially awful and he has been terrible in everything I have ever seen him in starting with SNL where he would always ruin sketches and laugh at himself and up to today with his late night show which is easily the worst one possibly even worse than Jay Leno. Queen Latifah I usually like but she stinks in this I bet she just did this for a quick easy pay check.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Washburn is an undercover cop who, after yet another job ending in a crashed car, has his license taken away and put back on the street. Meanwhile cycle courier Belle has finally gotten her taxi license and is preparing her souped up vehicle for the New York City streets. When a bank robbery in progress is called in, Washburn commandeers Belle's cab and gets involved in a high-speed chase with a group of Brazilian supermodels in a red BMW. Thrown off the case by the FBI, Washburn wants to catch the gang to get his job back, while Belle agrees to help so that she can get her taxi out of lockup.I quite liked the original for what it was so I decided to give this film a try to see if it could manage to be fun. I'll be honest and say that the trailer attracted me because it had car chases, a bit of a laugh and some faux-lesbian teasing ? there, gone are my 'art-house' credentials! I hoped that these elements could be kept fun and that the film could have a spark to it in some area that would raise it above the genre and actually make it fun to watch. Sadly I was wrong and my worries about the effort put into this film were realized in the first few minutes of the film where a skinny person on a bike is revealed to be Belle ? even though their body shapes could not be more different! With this lack of attention to detail I did not have high hopes but I figured I was being picky and tried to get past it. However from here on in everything is exactly as you would expect ? lacking imagination and effort in almost every regard.The plot is nonsense but to pick on that is to be too demanding because none of us expected anything too cohesive or logical but suffice to say that attempts to build stories around the characters are all flat and uninteresting. However what I did need from the film was action, excitement, comedy and spark. The action is OK but nothing special ? the use of CGI cars to make impossible stunts really takes away from the impact of the action, while the limitations of the busy streets means that the car chases are very tightly cut and never feel real and impressive. This reduces how excited the audience can feel and me and the other 15 people in the cinema sat rather impassive for most of the action scenes. With this OK, then the comedy needed to match it to produce an OK film, but it didn't. Not at all. The comedy is partly based on that wonderful comic device ? that black people are cool and sassy while white people are geeky and uptight. Oh, how I never tire of seeing racial stereotypes enforced in the name of comedy. With this old chestnut wheeled out again, the rest of the comedy falls into line and I never really laughed more than once. The button pushing and lack of imagination continues with the robbers themselves who are nothing more than legs and skin who are there to attract an idiotic and salivating male audience (ie ? me) on the promise of titillation. They don't deliver this very well at all and the scenes where they try to feel cheap, tacky and exploitative instead of sexy and fresh.The cast are lumbered with the material but they don't do as much as perhaps they could have done to make it better. Fallon is annoying and geeky ? simply filling the 'white' cliché in the 'cool black/geeky white' combo. Latifah continues to just play the easy ethnic cliché stuff for every penny.I don't know if she is like this in real life but I must admit that I do find her ethnic cliché to be lazy and rather offensive ? her smart-mouth, impatience and speed to violence has been in many of her last few roles and I don't think it is the best use of her position, but then again if you put money in front of me then I'd probably do the same. Esposito is pretty wasted in a thankless role before being used as a piece of meat for the sake of selling the film to the male audience (yes, yes, I admit it). The models are nothing but eye candy and I didn't think they did it very well.Overall this is not a terrible film because it will appeal to boys and young teenagers with its noisy mix of unattainable leggy women, fast cars, basic humour and racial stereotyping; the target audience for this is shown even in the cut ? which removes a use of the MF word so that it can get to a younger audience. For me though I found it lacking any sort of imagination, spark or wit and instead just took the easy line of cliché, stereotype and noise. It will appeal to some, but not to me, and it was an effort to get to the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avoid This Taxi.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taxi (2004): Dir: Tim Story / Cast: Jimmy Fallon, Queen Latifah, Jennifer Esposito, Gisele Bundchen, Henry Simmons: The taxi may be a metaphor for support as Queen Latifah seems to be cop Jimmy Fallon's only form of transportation after losing his driver's license. He is a bad driver and she is a taxi driver who dreams of racing. Her taxi is equipped with every gadget one could ask for but her love life is falling apart with every missed dinner plate. Plot centres around a series of bank robberies performed by four models. This opens the door to much senseless sexual screen time with no point. Latifah and Fallon are the new duo to play off the buddy film comedy and what they deliver is just a series of dreary chase scenes. They will bicker and fight just like others before them, and they will solve the case and become stronger buddies. Director Tim Story does his best. He had success previously with Barbershop but here the script is about the same use as toilet paper. Jennifer Esposito as the Lieutenant is basically there to be body searched by one of the female criminals. The screenplay is about as terrible as Fallon's driving record. In the 1970's there was a classic sitcom that regarded taxis and their drivers. Watching several episodes of that would be superior viewing to this. Perhaps the best idea would be to place this film on the ground and see how many taxi cabs swerve to miss it, or appropriately do it in. Score: 2 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hilarious film where a bombastic taxi driver, Queen Latifah, meets up with a policeman who you begin to wonder how he ever became a cop to begin with. He can't drive; he appears to be inept at every turn and he has to take orders from the girl he dated who has now been promoted.The chase scenes are great as Latifah inadvertently becomes involved in the situation when Jimmy Fallon, terrific as the cop, loses his license.The bank robbers are foreign women who are tough to the core.On the way, Latifah gives courage and strength to Fallon and with bold initiative and clever ploys, the two team up to track down the culprits.You know that you're getting older when Ann-Margret plays Fallon's alcoholic mother, and she does a good job at it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I read a few reviews. And yes, I did not see the French original, so I cannot compare. I will not give it a 1.But this film make me laugh. Not as much as I want, but still OK. It is funny to see how the dots connect, how someone who is excellent at driving and other stuff is pulled in by a man who is bad at everything.The bank robbers are sexy, nice to look at, but do not have time to develop any character. Hilarious, how the end up with the taxi in their tail after each robbery.Love the scene where the female officer is body searched by the female bank robber."Trust me". No I would not trust that cop. Whoever gave him a license to drive, a badge, etc - need to recheck their work.2 for the driving. 1 for the funny part. 1 for the story. 2 for the acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite all of the bad reviews, I found this movie to be funny! I love Queen Latifah's sassy and sarcastic humor. Jimmy Fallon is also a goof ball in this movie. The best scene in this film was when Andy is trying to pull out of a parallel parking space, but fails to do so and continuously keeps crashing into the cars in front and back of him. However, other than those two, there weren't many other well-known actors in this film. Some of the chase scenes were also very slow moving in my opinion. I also noticed that the city location changed frequently throughout the film. While it may not be hard to notice, at one point they are driving through New York and then another point they are driving through Los Angeles (you can see the palm trees and the traditional California traffic lights.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the poop standard for bad movies. In fact I've frequently referred to it as one of the worst movies of all time. Bad acting from bad actors telling bad jokes with an even worse plot and then some. Now if I were a movie critic I would say something like, "I would 'steer' clear of this movie." Because every movie critic has to start their critique of how bad the plot is by writing the worst pun they can think of.. OK I'll just say this "This movie is awful."and a couple more lines to pass the IMDb standard for reviews... which is kind of a joke anyways because 5 of my friends and I got up in the theater and walked out because we'd rather walk around town than watch the rest of this movie (I ended up finishing it later on DVD, which I regretted immediately.. sad story, back then I thought I had to watch movies to the end..). Anyways, so IMDb makes you write 10 lines, but their "weighted average" on movie titles are so far removed from what the public thinks about them it's sad.. but here you go, I wrote your 10 lines so accept my review now. sorry for anyone else who kept reading this review.

		<fullReview>I haven't watched the original which is probably why I have such a different opinion. However, I found it hilarious and at some points sweet. And the scene between Gisele and Jennifer was awesome.There was so much humour and although I liked the film, I can say that the acting was poor at times and it lacked character development and some of the scenes that were supposed to be funny were not. Some of the acting though, gosh it was the worst I've seen. But I think I liked that because it was cheesy and stupid and funny and not at all serious. The only really serious scene was probably Jennifer and Gisele's and that was only slightly more serious. Or when Marta fired Andy.I feel like Queen Latifah shouldn't have been in this film, and they should have got someone who didn't make the film have the cheesy aspect, which is what I think caused it. I love Jennifer Esposito's acting which is actually the main reason I watched this film so I am rating it 8 because I like 'terrible' films and Jennifer Esposito's acting and her scene with Gisele boost it up a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Preposterous critical flop (considered one of the most blasted films of its year, although it somehow was a financial success regardless) has a cop (who can't drive!) having to join forces with a heavily-ticketed taxi driver (moving up from bicycle courier) to stop supermodels robbing banks in tricked-up BMWs throughout the city.This is so desperate for laughs, Queen Latifa plays keep-away with Fallon's badge, with uniformed cops showing up to the unlucky cop's humiliation! Jimmy Fallon is a funny comedian with the right material and Latifa has plenty of screen presence and likability to spare, but, for whatever reason, this film was a disaster that served neither of them well. The laughable James Bond taxi cab that has buttons on a console allowing her to add a Nascar speed (the steering wheel comes off and the car transforms into a "taxi supercar"), with Latifa flying through traffic with relative ease, and Fallon, despite all of his incompetency and ineptitude (while performing on and off duty) as a cop his peers ridicule and find a laughingstock. While Jennifer Esposito looks foxy in tight "precinct office-ware", why she continues to tolerate Fallon's bumbling idiocy (she yells at him as bosses did towards Dirty Harry Callahan, but at least Eastwood's San Francisco detective was just protecting himself against street scum, not always leaving behind wreckage and costing the city thousands for fumbling the ball) is all part of the "strain your disbelief" expectations this comedy demands from us. Gisele Bündchen (now primarily known as Mrs. Tom Brady) is the ringleader of her supermodel bank-robbing gang (again, further evidence of how hysterically ridiculous this movie is to ring out the laughs from wherever it is possible to get them). Most of the car chase parts of the film concern Latifa pursuing Bündchen, taxi supercar vs. tranquilized BMW; you'd think these two were experienced stunt drivers speeding through heavily protected obstacle courses meant to persuade us that they are blessed with the gift to avoid certain death and destruction while other cars aren't so lucky?wait, that is the case, isn't it? If you can accept the "credibility strained to the max" plot absurdities, this might just tickle your fancy. There's even a "special" part for Ann-Margret as Fallon's constantly-wasted mother?meant to be funny, this was rather hard for me to watch actually. Embarrassing, really, for Margret as she depends on her margaritas for sustenance (she doesn't cook, but there are plenty of drinks!). Henry Simmons is Latifa's "sensitive hunk", Jesse. The finale where Latifa is driving with Nascar, Jeff Gordon (her idol!) parks up alongside to greet her (nothing like a little product placement, right?) put the icing on the cake.The film opens with Fallon undercover as a Cuban smuggler, getting his partner killed by accident (it was the parrot), with those being set up getting away. Right here is the first of many incidents that shows us that this young man has no reason to carry that shield. It is even hard to sympathize with him because he pulls the shield, stopping cars immediately, causing a ripple effect that leads to a stockpile! Yeah, I can't see why Fallon wouldn't be promoted to where Giancarlo is on the force.</fullReview>

He is also great in Whip it. He's definitely my favorite actor and it was really funny when he dressed up as a Mexican. I'll spoil some of this movie for you, chances are that you've seen it because it came out in 2004. A woman named Belle drives a taxi and wants to become a race car driver. One day she meets a man named Andy who is a cop and wants to solve a case about a group of people who are robbing banks. During the film there is action and comedy and you will be laughing so hard like what Jimmy does in the bloopers. I loved, loved, loved this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not impressed with the pairing of Fallen and the Queen. Their 2 characters just didn't work well together. It was not funny and you could feel the jokes falling flat. Fallen plays an inept cop whose driving license is taken away. He teams up with Latifah, a taxi driver who would prefer to race cars, to track down hot Brazilian model bank robbers. I'm not sure who thought this was a great idea for a movie but it sure sucked.None of the car chase scenes are ground breakers. And I guess they thought the bickering between Belle and Jesse was supposed to be funny: well it wasn't.But, Fallen is who really fails. He's just not funny in this. I never thought he was that great on SNL either. He needs to hire Will Ferrell's agent.FINAL VERDICT: Not worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never felt the need to rip into a film as much as i do now. I just watched this film, and now i feel dirty. I don't live in the US so I honestly did not know Jimmy Fallon was alleged to be a comedian, i assumed he was just another C-list actor. I don't know how anyone could find him funny. I just don't get it. The original Taxi films were classic French comedy, a little different to Hollywood comedy, but hilarious if you're into it. This remake had pretty much exactly the same story, but without the good bits. It's like trying to make a cake with just flour instead of all the ingredients. You're gonna end up with a mouth full of crap.The driving scenes were no better than any other standard-fare Hollywood-action-movie rubbish. I'm not an expert on modified cars, but i know that the majority of car-talk in the film was gibberish or irrelevant. The scene with the nitrous was appalling, you don't want to inhale automotive grade nitrous, as it is full of (dangerous) impurities, you need medical or catering grade. And "laughing gas" is a misnomer, it doesn't make you laugh like a retard or make your voice sound stupid.I suppose it's a film you can laugh at, instead of laughing with it. That and Gisele are the only saving graces of this pitiful tripe. If you watched this before the original, then i'm afraid you are now tainted, and nothing will make it better. Unless you can forcibly remove it from your memory. With a hammer.There are so many other films in the world, watch them before you watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, my low expectations were met!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Minor Spoilers) I didn't know this was a remake of a French film of the same name while watching it! I guess, I'm kind of curious to see if the original is as bad as this bloated version starring Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon.This version of 'Taxi' starts off gratingly as we are introduced to car enthusiast and bicycle courier in Belle (Latifah). She has just got her Taxi license, and what do you know, she makes some adjustments overnight, and the vehicle is a James Bondesque speed machine. We are also introduced to Washburn, a Detective who screws up a case by doing a really bad unfunny Cuban impersonation, and crashing a vehicle. Poor Washburn has no license, so when a bank robbery occurs near his vicinity by some Brazillian supermodels, he accosts Belle's Taxi. These two becoming unwittingly paired together for high-speed misadventures, as Washburn wants to redeem himself in the force, and Belle needs to fix her failing relationship. Yet, both are eluded by a bunch of bank robbers with a equally high powered vehicle.Thankfully, this film does have a couple of funny moments, particularly Belle's commentary of Washburn's Dae Woo- and her meeting his alcoholic mother. It is well shot, and well edited during the chase sequences, but I just couldn't wait for this mess to end. Other "comedic" scenes are embarrassing, and I don't ever want to hear Fallon inhale laughing gas again, or sing to help him drive better either. This film is meant to be stupidly far-fetched, so when the extremely over-the-top climax came along, my eyes couldn't really roll that much! Was I expecting any better? Not really. Just for good measure, they throw in an endearing bonding scene between Washburn and Belle that thankfully wasn't stretched out, yet covers all the plot-points.'Taxi' isn't the worst film of 2004, but it's certainly very bad! ** out of *****!</fullReview>

Washburn (Jimmy Fallon) is a cop who can not drive worth a lick. One too many accidents gets his license taken away. Undaunted, he hails Belle's cab one day to catch some bank robbers. She's game. However, things go wrong this time and the bank thieves get away. Somehow, Washburn keeps Belle in the game. Can they become heroes? One would think that a comedy with the Queen and Fallon would be quite a film. Think again. The script lets these fine comedians down time after time. One keeps watching for the performers and not the storyline and that equals disappointment. Also, if Gisele Bundchen wants a movie career, she must find a better vehicle than this, although she looks wonderful. Still, there are days when the boob tube has nothing good on the agenda and one can consider this film. All of those who love Latifah and Fallon would not mind spending a couple of hours with these folk, even in a vehicle as broken as this one.</fullReview>

I have to say I was more than pleasantly surprised as the movie turned out to be both funny and enjoyable. The main stars are entertaining and have some very funny moments and the car chase scenes are also well done although take second place to the comedy I feel. I would recommend going to see this film if your looking for a fun comedy to watch. I think a lot of the low votes are people comparing the film to another series of Taxi films which this film is based on. But I feel it should be judged for what it is and the low IMDb score at time of writing is in my eyes completely undeserving. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not impressed by the plot (after all, how predictable could it be?) but Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon played their roles excellently and both of them were hilarious! I thought that the "solution" for the "case" was quite boring myself. I found the beginning intro with the cycling tricks did not really fit in with the movie and it was very Dark Angel-ish. In the beginning I got very, very bored .. until the humour started -- then the time just flew by! Make sure you catch the bloopers during the credits as well. Some of them got me laughing as hard as I did during the helium scene (which is one of my favourites). A great movie to watch if you're looking for something to cheer you up -- just don't expect any deep conversations or meaningful endings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly but enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this was by no means the funniest comedy I've ever seen, I found it to be a light hearted and enjoyable film. The plot is complete and utter nonsense, but such is the case for nearly all members of the action/comedy genre. Within this film there are more than a few decent performances. Queen Latifah and Ann Margaret make solid and appealing contributions and Jimmy Fallon demonstrates what may eventually blossom into respectable talent. I'm not exactly certain why this film suffered so severely at the hands of critics (perhaps the overnight fame of the SNL star, Fallon, has garnered resentment). That being said, this is more of a "chuckle" movie, as opposed to a "laugh out loud" film. I would, however, recommend it to anyone who is willing to set believability aside for a cute and lightly humorous joyride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well i don't actually have much to say about this movie. Butt i'll start by saying that this movie is one of the worst movies if not so THE worst movie i've ever seen. As you can see in my profile i'm from Belgium so i saw the original version of this movie ( and it rules by the way :-) ) but when i heard that there was going to be remake done of this movie i thought "well maybe it wont be as bad as every other remake" ( cause American remakes of movies are always less then the original ( no offense ) examples: The Grudge, The Ring ) but again i was wrong, choosing girls in bikini's as the bad guys(girls) was a bad mistake same as choosing Queen Latifah as the cab driver and the way that the story is brought on to screen is also really bad, i also thought that a good point would be the car itself cause in the third original TAXI ( TAXI 3 ) the story wasn't that good but the car was one of the plus points, but that doesn't apply to this movie, so i'll give you one last advice : don't go and see this movie but try to get a hand on the original TAXI by Luc Besson and i'll assure you you'll have a great timegreetings from A.V.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually liked the originals to this movie. They are funny, classic already so of-cause a remake had to happen. So put in a nice way, this is bad, very. It tries to capture the funny moments of the original, for example the high speed chases that was originally filmed in real-time, the transformation of the car which the remake focus on once to be a science, the mother that had to be a drunk in the remake etc. and it simply fails miserably doing so. There are actually good things to say about this movie, it would be possible to write almost anything about it here, it wouldn't spoil anything as there appears to be no story to it other than "I drive fast and I have a very stupid co-driver" and the story to the movie is appearing so secondary that you almost have to concentrate to find it. The second good thing is that it has an end and I bet you'll come to appreciate that as well. I make myself believe that I've seen worse but I have doubts.</fullReview>

But let's face it, not every movie is a "Die Hard". But at the same time, not every movie is "Gigli" either. "Gigli" blew chunks. Compared to "Gigli", this movie is Best Picture worthy.

		<fullReview>Okay, apparently this wasn't a trendy new Hollywood version of old sitcom "Taxi," but instead one of those buddy comedies about the ridiculously mismatched pair who at first don't get along but eventually become best buddies. And of course, they catch some bad-guys (or in this case, girls) along the way. One is a hopeless loser cop played by Jimmy Fallon and the other is a need-for-speed taxi driver played by Queen Latifah. It's all about the formula here.Taxi had its moments. I think there were about 2 or 3. I admit I laughed out loud a few times. Laughing gas scenes always get me- there's a pretty funny one about half way though, and you gotta love Ann Margaret as Jimmy Fallon's alcoholic mother. Other than that, I was usually just waiting around for something interesting to happen. So..you can be sure that I was doing a lot of waiting.I wouldn't really recommend seeing Taxi. Paying to see it, at least. There are better movies you could see. If you're stuck in a hotel room at 2am after a cocaine binge with nothing better to do then maybe, just maybe, you could give Taxi a chance on Pay-Per-View. But even that's pushing it. It's best just to wait a year or two for it to be on TV for free. It does have a certain "guilty pleasure" appeal, at least.My rating: 4.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An offense to Luc Besson's trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Importing a successful idea from a great producer like Besson (The 5th Element, anyone?) and transform it in such a disaster is something quite rare. In fact, being a faithful fan of the original great 3 movies, I'm personally insulted.Okay, let's compare: Starting with the actors, well, the funny skinny cynical driver, Daniel, has been replaced by... the irritating, way too confident Queen Latifat... ?Queen Latifat? Seriously?! She hasn't the right attitude to play this role, although the person in charge of the cast selection is more to blame than the girl herself! Sure, I don't like her at all (like every man), but she's still an okay actress. As far as it's not supposed to be serious, she manages to stay natural, even thru these -very- stupid lyrics. Talking about stupidity, Jimmy Fallon took the place of the rookie cop, originally called Emilien, now named Washburn. In fact, he seems to try to be the next Jim Carrey, playing the naive, "unvolontary clownesque" kinda guy. Goofiness has its limits, at least in terms of credibility, and Fallon has none. Just watching him hitting cars like a blind cerebrally paralyzed deficient, just because we need to know that he's bad at driving, will make you sick and disgusted about mankind... Fallon is now on my top-5 of the worst performance ever (Steve West being the #1 playing "The incredible melting man"), really. He's not just pathetic, I dunno, I can't find the word... but I'll have to censure myself. This remake is in fact quite different from its counterpart, and not for the best: Several characters changed of sex, which just corrupted the way the movie should sound and was originally intended, while some simply got deleted. Overall, these new characters were poorly acted, average at best.Furtermore, the speedy, tortuous, sunny and marvelous locations of the original movie have been replaced by the gray and boring vicinities of New-York city. The truly sporty and lovely roaring Peugeot 406 of the original movies is now a heavy and huge Crown Victoria, pathetically disguised with a hood intake, skirts, mags and spoiler, and, oh joy! it's yellow! It seems they just forgot that the taxi was the core of the concept, feeling now like an accessory. And, seriously, USA rule 3 major motor companies, Ford, Dodge and GM... Ain't there hotter cars than this standard taxi juggernaut?!How about story? The trilogy was humor and action centered, so the story was a pretext to speed excess, laugh, and gun fire. Then, if you take the USA version, just dilute everything down 10 times and you'll almost get it. The original sarcastic atmosphere and well timed jokes left place to some of the most anorexic, silly and uninspired humor you've seen since a long time. I'm glad I haven't paid to see it, but my poor sister did, what was she thinking? Only "Are we there yet?" come close to to that level of crappiness... and guess what? She rented it too...Yes, it really is that bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know going in to this one that its just for the laughs. I really enjoyed "Taxi". They were in the garage with the nitrous, I almost came out of my seat laughing so hard. The actually taxi cab is better eye candy than the three model/bank robbers. I thought the new idea of how to get the money without being caught was clever. I also liked that Jimmy Fallon thought Jen Espositos character was madly in love with him. While she totally blew him off. Queen Latifah I always like,she gives it attitude w/a lil ummph. The music had you jumping,exciting to see what was coming up. The action was good because it wasn't overdone. The dialogue I thought was well balanced. I am not a fan of when they talk to much before something happens. If you like SNL you'll be the type wanting to see "taxi" over &amp; over &amp; over.There wasn't much to ponder in the movie. Ahhh, who cares?? It was an excellent time. One I think you should share with a group of friends, then laugh over dinner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Note: This is not the movie to see if you are looking for a serious plot, or Oscar award-winning performances. It's a fun movie and you will get some smart laughs out of it. Fallon's Washburn makes you laugh at him, with him, root for him, and feel sorry for him. Latifah is witty and hilarious as Belle, the racing taxi-cab driver. No real "notable" characters (although Ann Margaret's role as Washburn's lush mother is quite funny), but that's not why you go see this movie. You go see it for cheap entertainment and for a few (well, a lot of) good laughs. Trust me, the plot is one of the most ridiculous I've ever heard of, but they somehow make it work. The entire theatre - the majority of which were adults - was cracking up, although a few jokes fell flat. I think you also have to understand and appreciate Jimmy Fallon's sense of SNL-style humor to enjoy this film for all that it is. Out of 10, I gave it a "6". If I was judging it on how "enlightening" and "stimulating" it is, I'd give it less, but again, it's a "joyride" of a movie and I had a blast watching it. IMDb Vote: 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm actually old enough that when I hear the word 'Taxi' as a title I think first of the melancholy Harry Chapin song, a wonderful piece of music; maybe with a little reflection, I conjure up the seventies sitcom of the same name. Perhaps the makers of this new film were hoping for some of that association to rub off on people and lure them in, because if a movie is titled what it's really about, this one should have been called 'Chasing four hot chicks who can't speak English.'The plot of Taxi follows Detective Washburn (Jimmy Fallon, making his debut as a movie lead) and bike-messenger-turned-cab-driver Belle (Queen Latifah) as they inadvertently get tangled up with one another and have to figure out who is ripping off a series of Manhattan banks and try to catch them. Rounding out the cast (no pun intended) are Jennifer Esposito (you might remember her from Spin City) as Washburn's lieutenant, Marta, and supermodel Gisele Bundchen as the head hot chick.I knew I was in trouble when I saw 'based on a script by Luc Besson,' because, while I like some of Besson's material, he hasn't done a good movie since 'Fifth Element' and that was a while ago now. I haven't seen his version of this movie, but I'm betting it's nearly as maladroit as this one.Much of the problem stems from the casting. Fallon, while a funny performer, is just out of place as a dorky, inept bumbler; it's as if he's trying to channel Inspector Clouseau half the time. Having him be a little green is one thing; but he's a walking mess, unable to do anything right, and it gets irritating quickly. Latifah, by contrast, is comfortable in her role, and she's a lot more enjoyable, but it's really hard to accept her as a bike messenger, especially after the lengthy stunt/title sequence they begin the movie with (one of the funniest gags in the movie, unintentionally of course, is watching a bike messenger do all this zany stuff and then having him pull off his helmet at the end of the sequence only to reveal Latifah. Come on, we're just not that na?ve). Esposito isn't too bad, but she's only given the standard 'angry cop lieutenant' cliché to work with, and even she can't make it work (and she seems a tad young to be a lieutenant, but that's another story). Only two people are really right for their roles: Bundchen and Ann Margaret, who plays Fallon's lush of a mother. Her scenes are kept short and punchy, and she's really effective and funny. Bundchen doesn't have to do much but look good in incredibly brief outfits, sort of what she does for a living anyway, but she has screen presence and in her limited role she works well enough (and has inhumanly long legs, but that's beside the point). She has just enough sass to pull off the role.Taxi has a few honest belly laughs, but by and large it's not really that good. The car chases are mildly exciting, but they aren't eye-popping like, say, Matrix 2, just your garden variety screaming around the streets of New York. Taxi isn't a very good film, but it isn't embarrassingly bad either. With some better casting (and some better writing, particularly on Fallon's character) the movie could have been a lot funnier. Pity it isn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is entertaining and a good popcorn movie. There some rough parts in this movie, but the Queen came to the rescue always. You can tell that this script came from the mind of Luc Besson the creator of the 5th Element. I would have liked to see the film stay to the original instead of the watered down rewrite. The comedy was sometimes over the top but the Queen helped it work. Good movie to be entertained with beautiful men and women, the car chases and sexual tension. 9 more the entertainment value. If you approach this movie with anything else than wanting to be taken for a fun taxi ride with the Queen do see it. But if you do what this taken for ride, by all means do.</fullReview>

The movie is fast and funny, "The fast and furious" mixed with a bit of "Bringing down the house". An interesting view at how people from totally different backgrounds meet in a situation that brings them together and they grow a friendship and help each other out to become better people in themselves. Washburn can drive now, and Williams gets to race, something she only dreamt of, and worked her whole life for. Sexy women as the bad "guys", a cab driver acting like a cop, a women as a lieutenant, and a man who shouldn't even be a cop, let alone have his license, an interesting combination to create one hell of a movie!</fullReview>

The Luc Besson version from '98 in a funny and entertaining piece of film. This is neither. This is a sad case of Hollywood trying to duplicate the European style of filmmaking. That in itself is usually a bad thing from the start, but when trying to duplicate or remake a Luc Besson film, it's impossible. In usual Hollywood fashion, it is just too dumb and ridiculous, all the way through. The cast and the cars in the original movie was memoralbe and great to watch, this is just painfully stupid.

		<shortDescription>An embarrassment in the film industry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taxi is not only lame, but it's extremely unfunny. Its idea of humor is either Queen Latifah yelling at Jimmy Fallon for being the stupid, whiteboy he is, or a long and cartoonish chase scene. Usually in movies, chase scenes are used to either portray a climatic scene or the biggest scene in an action movie. Taxi abuses them and uses them as humor in its contrived and incoherent plot.The story focuses on a New York City cabbie named Belle (Latifah) who has a loving boyfriend and has spent the last five years working on her cab and has added features a sportscar could only dream of. The story also focuses on a cop named Andy Washburn (Fallon),a bumbling cop who is now forbidden to drive his cop car after an accident.Trying to catch a group of supermodel bank-robbers, Andy's only method of transportation is a taxi. For some reason he can't get a partner, who knows? Luckily, he gets into Belle's taxi. The rest of the film is mindless action mixed with stupidity, dim-witted characters, and stiff dialog.The question that grew bigger and bigger when I was watching Taxi was how did Andy qualify to be a cop in the first place? He's completely idiotic and two nickels shy of a dollar. He's so brilliant in one scene he runs into oncoming traffic holding his badge in an effort...to get a taxi? Instead waving his hand out, he decided cutting into a crosswalk holding his badge and starting an unrealistic pileup would be the correct way to do such a thing.My other question was where does Belle find all the time and money to buy and work on her taxi, while still getting money from customers. It's a five year process, but all that work on one car could cost tens of thousands. I don't think it's worth losing sleep or evaluating.Also, why is Ann-Margret, the gorgeous woman from Bye Bye Birdie, Grumpy Old Men, Viva Las Vegas in this mess playing Andy's alcoholic mother? Is alcoholism really so funny that such an actress needs to play it unrealistically? I hate to say it, but those scenes with Ann-Margret were appalling to watch to say the least.Why Tim Story wanted to direct such an inspired mess of a movie is foreign to me since two years prior to this he directed the fantastic urban film Barbershop about several grown men talking up their city barbershop, sharing experiences, and giving relationship advice. Barbershop was well done and well written. Everything Taxi isn't.Taxi is sloppy, and its computer-generated car chases don't work in its favor. In a good movie like The Fast &amp; The Furious, the car chases are more like drag races, and they don't take place on a heavily occupied NYC block where it looks completely unrealistic. The Fast &amp; The Furious's chase scenes are well constructed, and don't seem so obtrusive. Also, there are other little minor jokes that don't involve chase scenes. In Taxi, that's all they got.Starring: Queen Latifah, Jimmy Fallon, and Ann-Margret. Directed by: Tim Story.</fullReview>

"Taxi 1-3" are so funny and full of weird action scenes, that I was doubtful, when I heard about this remake and saw the first trailer in the theater back then. The trailer was awful and apparently these were the "best" scenes of the movie.Anyway, last week they showed this movie on German TV and I forced myself to watch it. 90 wasted minutes. Jimmy Fallon, as the stupid cop, was ... (fill in any bad words you are thinking of), Queen Latifah - well, okay. The only reason why I gave this movie two stars instead of none, simply because of Jennifer Esposito, who I really like. She lit up the movie in the few minutes she was on-screen.If any company, who's in charge of making a remake of an excellent foreign movie, should think about dubbing those, rather then to badly copy them.

		<fullReview>How odd to find a film that tries to combine several light-hearted things at once: humour, ridicule of an apparent loser, sex appeal, high octane chase sequences, large and loud black women who either yell their lines or say them in a fast and sarcastic manner and equally; how not so odd to find that it all just implodes on itself.Taxi is not a funny film, it's not a smart film and it's not really that entertaining either. The fact the funniest parts of Taxi occur during the end credits in the form of outtakes allows the old gem 'the film was so bad that the best bits are the end credits' to come to the surface but it also says a lot about the film overall. If a film is listed as a comedy, I sort of expect it to be funny and funny this isn't. Some examples of the 'humour' come in the form of silly voices, a police man's badge getting fried to a crisp and then having it handed back to him as well as Queen Latifah doing her best with a weary script as she cracks dumb jokes and silly one liners whilst haring down a New York street at, wait for it: 120mph.I know that films aren't supposed to be 'real' as they're set in an entirely different world but half the things that happen in Taxi should never have even occurred in the first place. We are led to believe that a group of attractive Brazilian women (who are models in real life) are able to rob New York banks, use sophisticated weaponry and get away pretty easy ? it's up to New York's stupidest cop and most annoying cab driver to foil them, which of course they do and they make a lot better job of it than the normal New York police service whom it would seem couldn't catch a cold.This brings me onto the 'good guys' and 'bad guys'. The 'bad guys' aren't actually guys; they're pin ups and in fact they're not even characters; they're objects ? they don't even need to speak English. Now the 'good guys'; the character of Washburn (Fallon) is that of a complete moron. He lives next door to his constantly drunk mother (another attempt at weak humour ? alcoholism is meant to be funny!?), he gibbers in a silly and unfunny manner and basically manages to cock up everything he does: he can't drive or even hold up his badge to tell people he's a cop without having it pinched from him. His efforts to get it back resemble that of a ten year old trying to get something an adult's taken away from them.If Taxi does have a redeeming feature it's that the chases, albeit often abrupt, are entertaining if you just sit back and watch and although it sounds terrible of me to say so, looking at the four Brazilian women work their stuff as they either rob banks or drive fast cars or even just standing there is entertaining merely due to the fact they're pretty to look at. But that can't be held against me as the film's made that way ? remember that they didn't have to be stunning women but that's what the writer wanted and that's what we get. If you watch Taxi your brain really does need to be off the entire time since chases, weak humour and pretty girls is about all you're going to get.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taxi/2004/**Main Stars: Queen Latifah Jimmy FallonJennifer EspositoThis movie had everything you would want- action, humor, etc. The only bad thing was the story. In my opinion, the story was pretty lame. As you probably know from the previews, Jimmy Fallon's character is a cop and Queen Latifah's character is a taxi driver. In this movie Jimmy Fallon's character is on a case to catch these wanted robbers without a driver's license. Unfortunately, he gets befuddled very easily and he really can't get anything done right. Other than that, he still has the bossy lieutenant breathing down his neck every time he does something wrong. That's pretty much the story right there, pretty lame, huh? At least you have the action and humor to look forward to if you haven't seen the movie yet. Movie directed by Tim Story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While a fan of Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon (from his select good SNL skits), I was hesitant to see this given the Hollywood style trailers and previews. I didn't trust my gut and spent $8.50 on this in the theater. I wish I could give a good synopsis of this, but all I remember are terrifically filmed scenes with little to no plot nor character development. This is one of the few times I truly blame the writers as QL and JF are solid actors, and even Jennifer Esposito was terrible (or at least her character was). I mean, this is the brilliant actor in Crash and this film certainly did. The only redeeming value, for the boys, was watching Gisele flaunt her way around. The only redeeming (but snarky) value, for the girls, was watching Gisele manage to stumble through whatever lines she had. Oh what beauty does to the brain!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not hilarious or groundbreaking but capitalizes on what it has for good entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I already know that a lot of people didn't like this movie much, and I haven't looked up why yet. I'll admit that Taxi is not that flat-out hilarious nor is it anything groundbreakingly original, but it combines elements that audiences go for and presents them in a package that I thought was pretty good entertainment. The film grabs your attention from the start with an amazing stunt scene: a motorcycle tearing through the streets, alleyways, subway stations, sidewalks of New York in a race against the clock to get from Brooklyn to somewhere in Manhattan and back. The opening credits end with the driver making it to the finish line, taking off her helmet, and surprise it's a woman...Queen Latifah. Her character is apparently, not just any pizza delivery girl/cab driver but the fastest one around. A driver hops into her car at one point early in the movie offering to give her 100 dollars if he'll get her from JFK from midtown Manhattan in 15 minutes. With her trademark large-and-in-charge cockiness, she tells him how she normally doesn't stop for white guys but with him she'll make an exception (the guy's pretty rude to her so you don't really feel bad for him, and also don't get the wrong impression, this isn't a movie about a black person making fun of white people for 2 hours aka Chris Tucker in Rush Hour), and off she goes once again breaking traffic laws left and right, driving so fast that she outruns a couple policemen trying to get her for speeding. With her driving abilities, she naturally becomes a fitting compliment to Jimmy Fallon's detective Washburn, a cop who's achilles heel is he can't drive a car. When he's dispatched to attempt to stop a bank robbery, he has to call a cab to get to the scene, and that's how the two, through comically unusual circumstances, end up having to team up together until the case is solved and she can get her car back. Like Latifah, Fallon's character doesn't drift too far off from the comic we've come to know on SNL, and part of the joy of watching the film is the the joy this overgrown child has in picking up guns and playing cop. I don't know about anyone else, but I really thought Latifah and Fallon had a great odd-couple chemistry or should I say lack thereof. You'll have trouble finding two people at such opposite ends of the spectrum from each other. The movie wisely skirts around a road to a love/hate romance, giving Latifah's character a boyfriend who plays a minor role in the picture, and Fallon a crush on his boss (Spin City's Jennifer Esposito), and the funny moments when Esposito shoots down Fallon makes me think the movie is more self-conscious of itself than it lets on.The movie really does have a lot to it, in my opinion, if you don't go in expecting instantaneous laughs, throwing in some great chase scenes, a murder mystery, and 2 stars with some great comic chemistry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And it's not a bad thing either. The comedy in here beats our Fast and the Furious by the 1st intentional joke. Seriously, how can a movie featuring Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah with a clumsy, think-too-hard cop and a hard driving taxicab not be funny. It's damn near to the point of being brilliant.The action in this film is pretty damn good as well. Some people may argue that it isn't up to Fast and the Furious stats but I beg to differ. Fast and the Furious was a pretty good movie but the stunts weren't all that great and original. When watching this film I felt as if I was on the edge of my seat every time another car stunt was coming up. Especially during the last car scene including that rat trap. Plus that car transformation looked really good as well.Admittingly, the acting was pretty mediocre. It wasn't bad or anything but it didn't really make me say "Damn, they know how to act!" But really, how often does a viewer say that during a comedy, the biggest thing we look for is the jokes, something this movie definitely delivers.Worth a watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On my personal opinion this movie shouldn't be named after the famous French movie Taxi. With this title they maybe made this movie famous, but for those who watch French versions of a Taxi, this movie is a big failure because, with a good intention, they changed French car in American car (Taxi), French Driver for American black women and (for viewers from EU) get a failure. For Americans is different. Maybe is this movie thought to be for American or non EU viewers. But they, to inspire Americans and maintain Eu viewers, took American cars and a German BMW, which is like seating on two chairs, if you understand me.Greetings</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fallon's film TAXI isn't the best vehicle for him...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jimmy Fallon's film TAXI seemed to have everything going for it. Supermodel villains, Queen Latifah, Jennifer Espisito, and a very cool customized taxi that looks like it came from MTV's PIMP MY RIDE. Despite a line-up that looks like it will be quite an enjoyable comedy action film, the final product does not deliver. The script does seem to have been competent, but not much else. Some nearly humorous moments are lost in ill-timed deliveries, and even those were to few and far between. Watching the out-takes makes you wonder why other scenes found preference. They weren't great scenes, but they weren't any worse than some that remained in the final cut.The chemistry between Queen Latifah and Fallon does have a few shining moments. Despite this, the pair are not suited for each other and for the most part did not play well together. Fallon and Latifah both had nice delivery, but it just didn't seem to reach anything else.The stunts in the film were very well done, albeit conceptually unspectacular. Very few fight scenes worth mentioning, and not much of a mystery to the plot. A surprise does happen near the end when it's revealed a garbage man is helping pick up the stolen loot. Aside from this, the script is rather, if you'll forgive a pun, the script is rather pedestrian.In watching this, you see that Fallon is a genuinely funny individual. With the right script and director, Fallon could truly be stellar. Unfortunately, this movie was not the one to feature his talents. It's too bad this film didn't deliver the drive his movie career needs. For this particular piece, it's parked itself in a no-loading zone, and is about to be towed away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am so glad I didn't see this movie when it came out in theaters. None of the characters are believable especially police officer Washburn. What kind of a cop cannot drive a car? Isn't that a requirement in order to graduate police academy. In fact, they need to drive better than the average Joe. Jimmy Fallon who plays Washburn doesn't fit his character. Queen Latifah seems to get the same parts in every single movie. I think she is a good actress but she needs to explore her abilities as different characters. The taxi she is driving in this movie is cartoonish. The jokes between her and Fallon are not funny but rather pathetic. There is no chemistry between them. The car chases are subpar. We have seen way better chases in other films (Matrix 2, Speed, Ronin, Bad Boys I and II). If it wasn't for the 4 stunningly beautiful models, I would have given this film 1 out of 10. These 4 models play bank robbers and drive a BMW (a hot girl in a BMW - isn't that every man's fantasy... now imagine 4 hot girls). To sum up, this movie needed different actors and funnier more convincing dialogue to pull it off. Didn't work for me...</fullReview>

Ideas and situations, that are not particularly funny, are repeated like the script was written by a four-year-old (What was the purpose of Ann-Margret inclusion in the story). Plot points are telegraphed in the least believable way possible (Fallon and Latifah just happen to be in the right place at the right time every time). And least believable of all, when the crime fighting duo of Latifah and Fallon fails time and time again (I lost count) the police get mildly annoyed with them instead of just arresting them. The ending will have you shaking your head in disbelief.Avoid this amateurish fluff.</fullReview>

A radical thin bike messenger taking off his helmet to reveal himself as Queen Latifah's character.2. Jimmy Fallon's boss, the precinct lieutenant, is played by Jennifer Esposito. This cop had a plunging neckline in her opening scene that was so sexy it was hysterical. This woman was so hot it made me wonder if the casting team had ever been to a NYC police precinct. It ain't pretty folks trust me....i guess we can blame that on the NYPD blue phenomenon as well, but I couldn't hold back my bladder challenged cackling upon seeing this bombshell as lieutenant.I also thought the Hispanic stereotyping was really interesting. The flight that I was on had a number of Dominicans and trust me, when Fallon was poking fun at Hispanics with the cheesy mustache and mocking a Cuban accent there wasn't one chuckle on that entire plane.

Sorry guys, anyone serious about cars and modification would not spend five years of their life doing up an automatic. I could give you a million factual errors in this film.

It seems strange that every aspect of the movie could fail so miserably at it's own game, but somehow it was managed. Why producer Luc Besson, creator of the original 3 part french series would allow this to be sent to theaters as such an atrocious final project is beyond me, but hopefully his reputation won't be too tarnished after the monstrosity that is Taxi hits theaters.The story may not have sounded too inspired at the beginning, but Taxi had the premise to be a lot better than it turned out. The story follows Washburn (Fallon) an inept cop who is probably the worst driver in the history of automobiles, trying to track down and capture a group of foreign, supermodel robbers, in an attempt to redeem himself for screwing up at so many past assignments. After having his driver's license revoked for running over a fellow agent on the job, he hijacks a cab to get to a robbery scene. Belle, the cabbie (Latifah) is not at all pleased, and becomes steadily more angry after her new cab is damaged by the resulting car chase.Washburn is fired from the force after he makes another public mockery of himself and the police force, but he and Belle track down and capture the thieves by themselves anyway, by means of some smart driving, and knowledge of the highways on Belle's part. Sound boring, cheezy and totally unoriginal? Well these are the conclusions that jump to mind after seeing the film - the whole cinematic experience could be derived from reading the once sentence summary of the plot which appeared with the promotional material.The first of far too many mistakes was hiring director Tim Story (Barbershop), who seems to have absolutely no idea what to do with the material he's given, or how to make it even remotely funny. He seems to be holding out for cheap laughs, like watching people get knocked around a cab as it speeds around corners. If this was meant to be funny, well...let's just say nobody at my theater was laughing. (myself included) And was the fact that Washburn and his boss used to date supposed to be funny or surprising? It resulted as neither, yet they continually repeat it throughout the film, as if it is the major plot twist the film so desperately needed. Absolutely nothing Story tries to do using the material comes off as even remotely funny. (although it doesn't help that the script is totally uninspired, and presents absolutely no memorable lines) Like in most comedies, Story lets the moment sit after a 'punchline', but instead of the audience laughter he seems to be hoping for, it only raises a very awkward silence.The two principal characters (Queen Latifah and SNL's Jimmy Fallon) sounded like good casting at first, but neither of them raises many laughs. Latifah as the self serving cabbie plays herself as usual, but seems to pause awkwardly at every joke, as if she knows it isn't going to be funny the moment she says it. Fallon, playing the inexperienced cop plagued with bad luck and personal ineptitude, raises the odd laugh just by his facial expressions and mannerisms, but he is equally tied down by the awful script and absence of any sort of directing, and in the end just comes off as a flat and often used character, bringing not much memorability to the part. The supporting cast seems to have been picked based on appearance rather than any sort of talent, (although Ann Margaret may raise the odd chuckle as Washburn's hard drinking mother) and they come off as much better actors when standing silent in the background.This may not have had the premise to have been too funny, having the story mainly confined to the interior of a taxi, but it could certainly have been done an enormous amount better than this. Taxi would have been called an enormous letdown, was it not for the fact that it never really sounded interesting in the first place. As it is...if you could congratulate a film for not being good in any sense, Taxi would be a masterpiece.-2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie at a free sneak-peek at my college, because I honestly didn't want to spend money on it. After seeing previews, I thought it would be one of the worst movies ever made. Why did I go see it? Because I was a big fan of Jimmy Fallon on SNL, and thus felt the need to see how he did in his new role as a "real" actor.Surprisingly, I actually liked the movie. Yes, many of the jokes were crude or too obvious. Yes, there was a bit of overacting, especially by Jimmy as he tried to be lovably dorky. But the movie still managed to be entertaining, and still managed to make me laugh most of the time. Personally, I was very satisfied. While this is certainly not one of the best movies I've ever seen, it accomplishes its purpose in that it entertains.Who do I think will like this movie? Fans of Jimmy Fallon, as Washburn is basically his stereotypical character: inept but cute and lovable. Basically, you will like this movie if you don't go into it with expectations that are too high, or really try to think about any of it. Avoid it like the plague if you hate crude humor, Jimmy Fallon, or humor that is corny/obvious.</fullReview>

AND WHY? WHY did they change the amazing driver - character into a girl and why Q.L.???Hilarious too, that they used FX for the carchases, while the original movie was well known for the fact, that the director let stunt and racedrivers really DO it at full speed.So all of the reasons to see the movie they cut off it and sorry...Not a single point for this waste of time and money</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going in to the theater expecting this movie to be quite bad, I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was not all that bad, but it did suffer from the same problem as many other comedies in recent years... the commercials and trailers for the film give away too many of the jokes, which detracts from the humor that is derived from it.If you are going to see this movie, you are not going in expecting tons of logic or real situations, so I am not even going to analyze the fact that the Jimmy Fallon character would have never been a cop as long as he was and that no human being on the face of the planet with a double digit IQ could possibly be as terrible a driver as Fallon's character appears to be. Mentally challenged chimps could be trained to drive better than Fallon.Queen Latifah plays pretty much the same character as she did in Bringing Down The House, but she does do it well. Jimmy Fallon plays Washburn, a "slow" police officer who does not know how to pull out of a parking spot. Added to the mix are Jennifer Esposito, who plays his beautiful Lt. (boss) and ex-girlfriend, Gisele Bundchen and three other absolutely stunning bank-robbers who speak virtually no English and do not do too much as far as acting foes, but wow did they look delicious.There were some pretty good car chases and enough action to hold your attention, while the jokes were hit or miss. There is nothing particularly memorable about this movie, but it was enjoyable. I would recommend a matinée to someone who wants to see a moderately funny action/comedy that will entertain you.6/10</fullReview>

Honestly it is terrible, the script is dead, the direction - well i'm not sure about the direction, i'm sure some point of the compass was intended (pun), but was there a director? Tim Story - that has to be a pseudonym &amp; who could blame him for not wanting to be associated with this. Writing credit Luc Besson - according to the link this is the same guy who directed Leon, Nikita, The Fifth Element. I can only assume that he was very drunk when he wrote this rubbish, or they rewrote it &amp; he forgot to ask to be removed from the credits. Don't bother. Really - don't.</fullReview>

The original film works because it had all the ingredients to make it great: Class, Sass, and a whole lot of...well you get the idea. But the point stands. I'm not sure either the director, writers, etc etc realized what was at hand when they made this, but they clearly kicked themselves in the butt for this one. Queen Latifah has proved herself to be a fairly good actress, but one has to wonder why she was cast in this? Instead of giving her character witty and smart dialog, it's replaced with potentially insulting racial epithets. So this is their idea of "hip and coolness". I digress. I think the fact that Hollywood's idea of what it thinks the audience wants to see, clearly undermines the bottom line of the moviegoers intelligence. And that speaks volumes about what passes for entertainment these days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is awful. Whoever thought that it would be a great idea to choose Queen Latifa as a New York taxi driver who dreams of being a Nascar driver (uh what the hell???) driving some inspector gadget-taxi that transforms into a drag racer (baahaha). Then to choose Jimmy Fallon as a cop is a insult to police officers everywhere. The whole thing how he can't drive isn't even funny, its just stupid and irritating. The whole "Odd couple who hate each other but team up and solve the big crime even though they were told to stay away" thing has been played out about 50 times before this film. Although most of those in the past were at least pretty funny (e.g. Chan/Tucker), Latifa and Fallon are awful. I have no idea why either of them are famous. Fallon wasn't funny on SNL and hes not funny here. Queen Latifa is another actress I don't get. Shes not funny or even talented in my eyes, her whole diva act makes me want to puke. I don't think I laughed once. If the line "I got Daewoo on my hands" was delivered by anyone other than Latifa I probably would have laughed, Instead I just groaned cause the thought of Latifa being some car snob professional driver is like thinking of Kevin Federline winning a Grammy - ridiculous and stupid. The only reason I will give a 2 instead of a 1 is Gisele is some nice eye candy, which makes the scenes shes in at least mildly entertaining. Good thing I just watched this on cable, if i would have rented it I would feel cheated out of my money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak story prevents this movie from being a fun one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could had really been a fun movie to watch. if it only had a more interesting story that also made sense. The story is about as uninteresting and not-engaging as it can get and is filled with improbabilities and unexplained things. Because of this you can't really enjoy this movie for what it is, since the jokes and characters don't really work out either because of these reasons.Why on Earth would models rob banks and how ever did the Jennifer Esposito character fall for the Jimmy Fallon character? Just a few things that just don't make sense in the movie. The movie simply chooses not to bother to explain things. It makes "Taxi" a very shallow and simple movie, that is professionally made and looking but serious lacking in its substance. Because of this you can't really enjoy watching this movie either, although it certainly had potential, in its core.There are some fine actors in this movie. Queen Latifah is an Oscar nominated actress for a good reason; she is great! Even in a role like this. But seriously, she needs to stop doing these sort of simple movie, she is above that sort of movies. Jimmy Fallon is a good comedy actor but he is highly unlikely in his role as an undercover cop. Jennifer Esposito also isn't exactly credible in her role as police lieutenant. She is far too hot looking for that. OK that probably sounded sexist but it's true. Her looks really don't help to make her look believable in her role. There also are some smaller roles for well known actors such as Henry Simmons and Ann-Margret. The movie lacks a true great main villain. Gisele Bundchen plays the main villain in this movie but she doesn't exactly get much interesting to do to make here look like a cruel and believable villain. The only interesting moment with her is when she frisks the Jennifer Esposito character. Oh boy, here I go sounding sexist again but my God that scene was HOT! Guess that sequence alone is the only reason for still watching this movie. The movie is professionally made and it has some good car stunts in it. They still bring some excitement to the movie and its story but its not all quite good enough to make this movie still a good and recommendable one. The directing however is flawed, or else the movie would at least had been more fun to watch. The combination of the flawed weak script and uninspiring formulaic directing from Tim Story make "Taxi" a failed attempt to make a fun joyful entertaining movie. If only Luc Besson also directed instead of just producing it...Who knows, perhaps he would had made the movie its weak story still work and transformed the movie into a more fun and engaging one to watch.Stick to the French Taxi movie(s) instead. At least they're more fun to watch.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

I could go into how bad this one is compared to the original, but this would only seem true if you had seen the French "Taxi" first!The problem is that even not every movie-lover outside Europe had seen the original because it didn't get to most countries. Go to European film festivals and look under "International Movies" signed in you movie store / rental place. This movie deserves only 3 out of 10 because there's nothing original in the script -- the only major difference is that this a "Hollywood movie".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andy Washburn is a thoroughly inept police officer who's such a bad driver that his very own lieutenant takes his license away from him, leaving him without wheels to do his job in crime-ridden Manhattan. Belle Williams is a newly licensed cabbie, whose absurdly hopped-up taxi Washburn jumps into when he needs to get to the scene of a bank robbery. Together, they become an unlikely crime-fighting duo as they go after a quartet of gorgeous Brazilian criminals who look like they just stepped out of the pages of Vanity Fair or Vogue (quite possibly the least believable criminals in movie history). And if this synopsis doesn't sound like the setup for a cinematic disaster to you, you obviously have a much lower threshold for movie comedy than I do.Trapped in a vehicle that is practically a blueprint for how NOT to make an effective comedy, Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon have nothing to do for 97 minutes but exchange witless one liners in between highly preposterous and ultimately very boring car chases. Although the two lead actors try their best with what they've been given, they're eventually overcome not only by bad writing and by-the-numbers direction but by a bunch of supporting actors who give uniformly dreadful performances (including a sadly misused Ann Margaret).What COULD they all have been thinking of?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad remake of good original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seriously doubt the sense of humour of the general American with remakes like this. I hope for the Americans sake that you will punish the scriptwriter appropriately for this sorry excuse for a movie. What's so funny about a cop with a GUN discharging his weapon more accidentally then intentionally? Don't you know this is life threatening and therefore not funny. And how about driving into cars trying to get out of your parking spot without taking responsibility for the damages caused? Is wrecking somebody's property funny? And why do you think women can lead a police department? Or drive a car for that matter? I think that this movie is above all a science fiction movie because of that but never a comedy. If you take a look at the original ten you see what's funny and what not. And you can see that the police officer isn't stupid, he just hasn't got his drivers license yet. So he is mentally OK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talk about an unlikely duo. This comedy crime caper stars Queen Latifah, who plays Belle, a none too timid taxi driver on her first day with a souped-up taxicab with NASCAR on her mind. Belle by random accident finds herself helping a clumsy inept cop(Jimmy Fallon), who is driving challenged and hails a cab to get to a bank robbery. To make this flick click...the bad guys aren't even guys. The culprits are four Brazillian supermodels led by Gisele Bundchen. Some real nifty car chases and provocative posing by the supermodels may be equally dangerous. I can't really describe what Latifah and Fallon do as acting; but it is certain they can control a scene. Explosions, shoot-outs and some mild sexual references equal a PG-13 RATING. Very fine support is provided by Jennifer Esposito, Henry Simmons and Ann-Margret.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every once in awhile comes a movie as moronic, pointless and insulting as "Taxi" based on Luc Besson's French flick. This movie follows Det. Andy Washburn (Jimmy Fallon) who sucks majorly at driving and has to get a taxi to pursue a gang of hot foreign chicks that just robbed a bank... the taxi is driven by a street smart, jive-talking, Queen Latifah in the role of Belle. I don't recall a character being more annoying. Anyway, the film's story could be easily made up by a 7 year old and the script was just awful. But okay, nevermind that, there's a lot of movies that have idiotic plots that turn out to be freakin hilarious like one of my favorite comedies "Dumb and Dumber". But noooooo, this film wasn't hilarious... Fallon has a career because of playing retarded roles in Saturday Night Live. You can kinda tell he add libbed a lot of of the pathetically unfunny lines that he spits out constantly during the film's running time. Queen Latifah was just too freakin annoying. I gotta point out the things that I enjoyed: 1)Washbun's introduction where he is posing as a Cuban gangster was slightly funny. 2)Jennifer Esposito is hotThat didn't even make me like the film a little bit.

In the french one there are a lot more stuns than in the American version of Taxi even though the American version had a lot more funds. And another problem: in the french TAXI the transformation of the car it's made much better.

		<fullReview>I actually saw this movie on a trans-Pacific flight - first thing I thought, when it came on, was that it merely had the same name as the French Taxi movies I love so much. Next, when I saw the opening sequence was nearly identical, I started to get worried that the original had been remade and destroyed by Hollywood. I was right!If you watch this movie without prior knowledge of the French Taxi movies, you may or may not like it. It's a fresh idea and a fun movie. The acting wasn't great, but at least non-serious roles like this don't require top-grade acting. What made this movie horrible, though, is that it just didn't measure up to the originals (Taxi and Taxi 2). Even though I don't understand French, and my Taxi DVDs do not have subtitles, I still thoroughly enjoy them, as they are packed full of exciting car chases and slapstick humour. They are both incredibly tightly-packaged movies - they never lose my attention. The remake had several completely unnecessary scenes inserted, was full of bad jokes, and to top it off, had far less interesting cars.Though this movie is useful in helping you understand the Taxi story (if you don't understand French), I must urge anyone to watch the originals as well/instead!</fullReview>

I would just like to put thinks clear, because truly, sometimes a movie tries to hard to accomplish its objective but it ultimately fails. Honestly, this film stole some laughs from me, but not many, I mean: it was really stupid and nonsense most of the time. I couldn't think of anyone believing that if a person is funny doing one thing, this makes that person funny in doing anything. Yes, as many could say, Jimmy Fallon spreads talent all around when he steps on the "SNL" set. But when he steps on a movie set, I have to tell him: "That's different buddy, you're not doing the same thing you do always" What a mistake they made in telling this guy to act as he always does. Movies are another thing, and for a television actor, a very important chance. You're ruining it, Jimmy! It was awful to hear this guy talking and see him making faces. He had the stupid lines ("My precious") and the embarrassing moments. I mean, the movie was embarrassing in these moments, but he made it more embarrassing. Good luck with your next project, Jim, although I'm not expecting one. The rest of the cast was pretty solid, for what they needed to do. Queen Latifah continues to grow (and I'm really sorry if you don't agree) as a charming leading lady (in this case playing the taxi driver Belle) becoming the only worthy thing to watch in the movies she's in. I mean, last year I went to see "Bringing down the house"; I fell asleep! She woke me up, or a friend of mine, I think. So I should just recognize Latifah's talent and hope she continues to grow. The experienced Ann-Margret has the biggest, if not the only laughs in the movie, drinking without stopping for a second, and living next to his son Washburn (Jimmy Fallon). This made me thought if Fallon lives with his mother too. Henry Simmons, still a newcomer, gave the best of his character, which wasn't much.Actually, nothing could be much at all, because the storyline was so repetitive and the script was so lame. They just couldn't get tired of chasing scenes, could they? The film is not a shame when it comes to direction; but I just can't understand why Tim Story, after doing a respectable comedy like "Barbershop", got into this. There was a lot of movement in the camera, not that bad. The Statue of Liberty shot and Times Square weren't forgotten, of course. If I don't say much about the story, it's not because I want you to find out, but because it would be useless (you'll probably get what I mean, later).But then after all, we end up wanting a little bit more from this piece that doesn't provide us as it should. A one paragraph should be written, praising the team for putting Jennifer Esposito and Gisele Bundchen in the same movie. These two fine women are reason enough to watch this film. They were intelligent enough to know the movie wasn't working; but they knew the girls would. This is also a business.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always had a novel idea for Loren Michaels, the producer of Saturday Night Live. If some of the best actors on your series decide to strike on their own to make movies, they should be allowed to come back to SNL if the "first" movie they make winds up stinking as much as this one did. This movie always reminds me of how lucky I am that I stick to renting movies as opposed to going to the theater and shelling out $8.75.Having said that I would recommend to anyone reading this not to even bother renting this movie. It is not even remotely funny. It is pathetic and for all the guys like myself who rented it solely to see Gisele Bundchen don't bother. She's in it for probably not even 15 minutes and 90 percent of that time she's wearing a 3 piece suit. Believe me I've seen some bad movies but this one was a real stinker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with the "RAT", this movie is worth than pathetic, bad story line, acting, and humor. Have a look at the original (french) the quality of all of these 3 aspects are too good to compare to this rubbish. Queen latifah should stick to her Mic and the rest of the actors, banned them from acting. Serious... the high point of this movie are the Brazilian chick and the racing, even thou i have seen better. About the humor... where is it? there is an extremely stupid cop, which i wonder how he got the job in the first place, one thing is not knowing how to drive but pure stupidity...

		<shortDescription>The worst movie in all recorded history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen a more moronic movie than Taxi. From the first 10 seconds of the movie to the credits I have never ever experienced a more predictable and stupid film. The only reason I saw more than the opening scene was because I was stuck in an airplane on the tarmac for an hour and 45 minutes. I could write for the rest of my life and still never explain to you how bad this movie is. Here's a quick list of the movie's assumptions: 1. There is only one place in all of New York City to buy run-flat tires. 2. There is only one red BMW anywhere in New York at any given time. 3. Queen Latifah is capable of riding a bicycle faster than 5 mph. I could go on and on for weeks. The three or four shots of Gisele cannot make up for this poor excuse for entertainment. This should be used as a training tool in every film school in the world as an example of what not to do in every sense of film making. I just don't know what more to say. This movie will make you want to scratch your eyes out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is just another Hollywood remake of the great french movie "Taxi" (they didn't even come up with a different name).http://imdb.com/title/tt0152930/You have all the ingredients with just minor twists.In the original we have a male taxi driver, here we have a female (that's probably the only difference). We also have the dumb cop who keeps screwing things up. There is also a gang of bank robbers but instead of driving a Mercedes (in the original), they drive a BMW.The plot is the same. There is nothing original with this movie.I've seen the original trilogy, and it's quite good. And I'm not such a big fan of french films.But this movie has nothing to offer. The story has already been told, and there isn't one single thing new in this 'english' version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The characters are not believable and there is not one single original element in this one. An American remake that fails to translate the excellent humor from the French version. The plot... 4 hot babes robing banks??? If they look like that, they star in movies (like those 4), in fashion shows or they're married to millionaires.The cop who's living next to his mom and drops the gun when he tries to shoot? Sure... if he's French :) or lives somewhere in Utah...Queen Latifah riding a bike like an insane maniac in the subway, out, in front of cars (on top of cars)? Like... HOW??? It's like Mama Morton to surfing...I feel that American movies are getting father and farther away from presenting a possible reality and start exaggerating every aspect. The original Taxi movie was doing exactly the opposite... while not realistic in the car chases, the characters are playing actual prototypes of the French society.</fullReview>

Queen Latifah was okay but the relationship between her and Fallon's character was... not existent. The four gangster ladies are nice to look at but totally miscast. Even for a film like this it is laughable to think of them as bank robbers or villains. And the mother... ARGH! My suggestion: see the original!

Why BMW's if you've got a budget the size of a developing counties GDP maybe you could have used slightly cooler cars maybe Audi RS4 anyone? And the taxi being a FORD one word o-dear!

Smith, however, improved as an actor through his TV series, "The Fresh Prince of Bel Air."

Why do people go to the movies looking for some kind of revelations?!! Why can't people just go to the movies to get away from it all and just have a good time laughing, crying, etc at someone elses expense.

Ann Margaret did a great job, she was a surprise for me (I didn't pay any attention to who the people were in the film before I saw it). Queen whatever she is did a good job - is she some personality I should know from other work? Whoever played the Lieutenant had the weakest performance in the cast, but it was acceptable.

Jimmy Fallon may not be the greatest actor, but he's got some pretty decent one-liners, though it's Queen Latifah who summons the most laughs.

		<fullReview>You can't move for sequels, prequels, spin-offs and remakes (or re-imaginings) these days. Hollywood is suffering a real dry spell when it comes to new blood as most stuff we get now is from previously released material. Some remakes can be impressive (Dawn of the Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and others can be downright pointless (Alfie!). Taxi is an obscure choice. The original French version was written by Luc Besson in 21 days out of pure boredom as he waited for Columbia to green light The Fifth Element. It was an okay, silly action movie that spawned 2 sequels itself. While it's a mildly popular film it's hardly the kind of thing that warrants an American remake. How many Americans (or anyone outside of France) cared for the original Taxi? As ramshackle as it is, Taxi NYC still seems to hold together thanks to the energetic performances of Queen Latifa and Jimmy Fallon. They do what the can with the limp material and are capable of duping you into believing that the movie is better than it really is. What's so bad about it? Well, the plot is non-existent and is really just a set-up for a couple of brief chase scenes featuring Latifa's suped-up Taxi. Director Tim Story tries to copy the easy-going pastel-colored design and liberated use of widescreen photography of the original as well as keeping the speed of the chases as fast as he can but the stuff in between is so dated and his direction feels like the kind of quality film-making you'd expect of Rush Hour 86. Plus, the sexuality of the original film has been erased. In France this would have been called harmless but in America they call it pornography.It's hard to give this film a bad review as there is at least one good laugh per scene but the cheap, cruddiness of it prevents it from being anything more than a one-time only rental that won't really hold up upon repeat viewings. Trust me.The DVD is in great looking 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with good enough Dolby 5.1 sound. The sound design is hardly anything to write home about so don't expect to. The DVD I watched (Region 2) had an extended version of the film that ran 6 minutes longer. But there was nothing particularly racy in this version that would have denied the film the pleasure of being PG-13. Let's hope they don't sequel this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like TORQUE, this was a film a lot of people didn't like, but appealed to me, mostly due to the auto action. Yes, the plot can be way preposterous at times but I didn't care.Queen Latifah is great in the lead as Belle Williams and her 'ultra cab' is to die for. Jimmy Fallon is a bit annoying as Washburn, but it's good to see him develop both some guts and some brains as the film goes on. And as the main bad girl, Gisele Bundchen does pretty well, especially seeing that this was her first acting role.The car chases are well-staged, but there's not enough of them! The tension in the love-lives of our two heroes are a bit tiresome at times as well, but the film is still great. I really loved Average White Band's 'Pick Up The Pieces' being used for Belle's first taxi run, because it's one of my favourites and a really funky piece of music.There's potential for a sequel, but I guess that won't be happening any time soon. But I give TAXI a confident 6/10.</fullReview>

Jimmy Fallon is an awesome actor, he is one of the best Taxi was a very good movie. There were some parts that were stupid but overall it was hilarious. Queen Latifah's character was a reckless taxicab driver who helps Andy Washburn (Jimmy Fallon) catch a group offemale Brazillian bank robbers. I think that Jimmy Fallon is a great actor, I have not clue why people say that he is not a very good actor, and that his career will not last long. I have to disagree with that because Jimmy Fallon is an awesome actor who makes movies that he is in funny, and enjoyable. Queen Latifah was also very good in this movie. I think that she played this character just as well as she played the character Charlene in Bringing Down the House. If you are looking for a movie with laughs and with a couple action scenes then I would recommend this movie. The only thing that I do not like about this movie is the character Marta. I really think that she is a character that the movie could have done with out. Y y'all hatin Jimmy?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taxi is cheap fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jimmy Fallon is the most recent Saturday Night Live veteran to try the big screen and although he is teamed with Queen Latifah, the results are a mixed bag of low brow comedy and slapstick humor. The plot centers on Detective Fallon who cannot drive competently and loses his driver's license. As a demoted patrolman he responds to a bank robbery and solicits Latifah's taxi for a chase. It turns out the four bank robbers are not who they appear to be; they are actually beautiful females from Brazil who conduct their crimes with expert precision. Add to this Fallon's conflicts with his boss (a former girlfriend), Latifah's impatient boyfriend, and Fallon's alcoholic mother (Ann-Margaret), you have a rough picture of the setup. Essentially Fallon's inept character and Latifah's strong spirit collide and then form an uneasy alliance as they track the robbers. Needless to say, things somehow work out in the end and there is a certain amount of redemption for all concerned.The film wavers from wanting to be more than it is, and while it does have some cheap laughs and silly humor, it never rises to a rip roaring laugh fest. In fact, there are close similarities to Bringing Down the House right down to the scene where Queen Latifah coaches Fallon (in the Steve Martin role) in overcoming his fears and gain confidence. There are endless car chases and they are done with good stunt driving and cutting. There is no doubt that the pace of the film is pretty good, but the childish situations and lack of a more substantive script really limit this comedy.It's really a shame since Latifah is a very talented actress and Fallon has proven to be good at skit material. This is a film that will do OK with the masses but will surely be pummeled by critics. It just doesn't engage any brain cells, so approach it in that manner. Still, the movie did serve as a light diversion, and Latifah is always a force of nature.</fullReview>

It can make me laugh when I am not in a good mood and I recommended it to my parents and they loved it as well! RENT IT YOU WILL LOVE IT AND THEN YOU WILL BUY IT! ITS AWESOME!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the movie, everyone that went with me loved it too. And from the laughter in the theater it seemed everyone else love it. My favorite part was with the laughing gas, I was laughing so hard I couldn't breathe. I almost fell over on my sister. I think it had everything a good movie needs: comedy, action, romance and an intelligent plot. It wasn't predictable and it kept you guessing. Even when I thought I knew what was going to happen next, it would be something else I didn't expect. I think this is a great start for Jimmy Fallon's movie career as a leading man and I look forward to his movie with Drew Barrymore. Its my new favorite movie, I am probably going to see it every week!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Silly, But I Laughed a Lot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A stupid detective that is not a good driver uses a terrific taxi driver, who dreams to be a pilot of racing car, to chase four bank robbers in a BMW. With this simple story line, "Taxi" is a very silly movie, but I laughed a lot. The greatest attraction for me was certainly the debut of the Brazilian top model Gisele Bündchen as "actress". But indeed Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon carry this dumb, ridiculous and absurd story in a very funny way. Another funny situation for the Brazilian viewers is to hear Ana Cristina de Oliveira speaking Portuguese with a strong accent from Portugal as if she were Brazilian. I laughed a lot with her pronunciation in Portuguese, which sounds very funny for us. I totally disagree with comments like "the worst movie ever made", probably made by persons without sense of humor as commented by another IMDb user. "Austin Powers" movies, just as an example, are dumber and less funny than "Taxi". If the viewer does not have much expectation about this film, he or she may probably have a good time. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Taxi"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taxi is an almost miss. The problem I had with the film is that there isn't that much there. It's one of those movies where they show bloopers in the end to show how much fun the actors had. Sure they had fun, but did we? Not quite.Jimmy Fallon plays a cop who can't drive, and Queen Latifa plays a taxi driver who loves speed(Ha, isn't that funny). The two of them team up to stop a group of female Portogeuse bank robbers led by Giselle Bundchin. The chick may be hot, but she can't exactly act. What did we expect though she is a model all they wanted was eye candy.The highlight of the film is Jennifer Esposito from Spin city and Crash as Jimmy Fallon's boss and ex girlfriend. Not that her performance is worth Oscars, it's just that her character doesn't seem so fake. She's not exactly meant to be funny though. Queen Latifa and Jimmy Fallon are meant to be funny, they are extremely likable people. But the film Taxi falls flat.I hate to use the term I am about to use. But Taxi has cheap gags, quite a few of them actually. I left out Ann Margerate, the great, who plays Jimmy Fallon's mom. Though she is barely in it, she is likable. Every person in this film is likable, it just seems like this movie is a skit that just keeps going. The Movie didn't feel real to me. What did I expect it's a somewhat remake of Taxi. Now to end my review, let me say one more thing. Thumbs down.Taxi:**/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taxi for this rubbish - 21%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've talked before about the perils of seeing the original before seeing a remake, especially if the original was not a product of Hollywood and required subtitles. As a consequence, I was unlikely to prefer this movie to the French film of the same name on which this is based, even if this film were brilliant. But, sadly, it's not - this movie is about as much fun as being the victim of a hit-and-run and if you've any sense at all then you'll run a mile from this hugely disappointing waste of your time.Isabelle Williams (Queen Latifah) is a streetwise speed-freak, rushing around New York in her pimped-up, tricked-out taxi cab. Unfortunately, her path crosses with bumbling cop Andy Washburn (Jimmy Fallon) who is struggling to overcome his ineptitude behind the wheel to pursue four bank robbers who have a tricked-out vehicle of their own. With his licence revoked and her taxi impounded, the pair find themselves working together so they can get back on track. But with her boyfriend Jesse (Henry Simmons) feeling neglected and the police, led by Lt. Marta Robbins (Jennifer Esposito), seemingly unable to crack the case, it seems Andy and Isabelle have their work cut out for them.I honestly cannot think of a single thing that I enjoyed about this film, besides staring at Gisele Bündchen's flawless legs. Fallon plays Washburn like a more irritating Mike Myers trying to be Inspector Closeau, going "full-retard" and never convincing as a New York cop - he'd be shot on his first day in real life. Latifah has the better lines and is much better as the gobby cabbie but no-one will watch this for the acting. You see, the original was famous for its jaw-dropping car chases in and around Paris - you can see its influence in the likes of "Ronin" and "The Bourne Identity". What this version of "Taxi" does is have loads of CG, a few sped up shots and lots and lots of straight-line speed because, of course, downtown New York does not have a single curved road anywhere and this was always the problem. What was the point in relocating a film like "Taxi" to New York - it's like having a Formula One race at a NASCAR bowl, going round and round with nothing to alleviate the tedium. Even the comedy falls flat with no-one providing any real laughs at all, leaving Fallon woefully exposed as a leading man who is about as funny as falling down a flight of stairs.I think my Better Half summed it up best when she said it was "so s***, it was funny" but I wasn't laughing. This is an undeniable turkey and one you should make every effort to avoid. If possible, track down the French original which is also called "Taxi" as that film is a lot more fun and exciting than this dross, despite having similar plots and characters. Fallon should stay on "Saturday Night Live" so us UK viewers don't see any more of him than we have to, though God knows how he's stayed on that show if he's as funny there as he is here. So what we have here is proof that if you have to see a film, try and watch the foreign version first because it will almost certainly be better than a watered down, half-hearted and ill thought-out Yankee remake. This is worse than the US remake of "The Italian Job" and I hated that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the movies that I don't want to talk about since there is no great deal to say in the first place ! (Queen Latifah) wasn't a queen here at all. (Jimmy Fallon) is one of the finest SNL's diamonds yet here he was lusterless. (Jennifer Esposito) is nice but got nothing to do with comedy. My obsessive Ann-Margret is in worthless cameo, maybe her worst appearances on the big screen ever. Even the gang of Barbies, they weren't beautiful. Actually the fake world of comedy was too fake this time : no way the huge (Latifah) can ride a bicycle that clever, no way a police chief officer can be that young (or that hot !). The buddy-comedy works but in low level. It's all in the way this script deals with everything and everyone. It was exiguous sketch after another without one that, god forbid, makes you in stitches. Maybe they felt how silly and weak the comedy was so they had to add a light semi-lesbian solicitation scene to solicit being watchable, in fact putting it wholly gratuitous like that makes you feel pathetic more than being excited ! So, fairly it's an action more than a comedy. Just 90 minutes of not-so-good fun but with really cool car chases. It's the case of having the technician crew behind the camera doing their job better than everybody, however you mustn't underestimate this cast because they had been in nearly lost taxi. Still the thing that provoked me highly is a line by (Latifah)'s character to her men co-workers : "I know why you're here guys.. The view.. The view" referring to her body ! And she was that courageous to say it twice ??! As you see, the complete view was average or lower anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was Queen Latifah thinking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, "Bringing Down the House" was pretty thin, but at least there was a certain comedic chemistry between Queen Latifah and Steve Martin. In this one, Jimmy Fallon brings absolutely nothing to the party. I've long wondered who was hitting the pipe when they hired him for "Saturday Night Live". Now, I have to wonder who was dropping acid when they cast him in this movie. Something with a plot this weak definitely needs strong leads to carry it off, and while the Queen does her best, she gets almost no help from anyone else. The one thing they should have done to at least keep things interesting was to show Henry Simmons in much less clothing. At least they had the supermodels strutting their stuff once in a while. If you haven't seen this one, don't even bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. How do they make movies this bad? Basically, Fallon is a cop who can't drive, trying to catch some bank robbers, and involving Latifah in his mess, while at the same time, trying to hit on his lieutenant. I went into this movie with an open, open mind, and about 30min in, I wanted to strangle Jimmy Fallon. I would like to say he's slumming it, but he hasn't done anything halfway decent. Queen Latifah gave a pretty good performance though. That said, here are my 3 points to ponder: 1. Jimmy Fallon will annoy you.2. Gisele Bunchen looks good in anything.3. If you must watch this movie, watch it for one memorable scene with Gisele and Jennifer Esposito. It's the one true saving grace!</fullReview>

Queen Latifah is good as Belle, a wanna-be taxi driver who also hopes to be a race car driver someday. Jimmy Fallon is equally tolerable as Washburn, the cop who can't drive.The sexual content in the film is not so tolerable and it could do without it. The cussing could be done away with, also. But I like the concept. Not having seen the 1978 "Taxi," I'm not sure if this is any better than the original.The movie is good for rental or better yet, wait until it comes out on Comedy Central.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really hoping this movie was going to turn out to be a lot funnier than it was. I like Jimmy Fallen because he had some pretty memorable moments on SNL. Unfortunately the funniest segments of the whole movie were the outtakes at the end. I hope they give Jimmy another chance with a better script because I was really looking forward to having something to see in between Will Ferrell movies. The action was okay and the car chases were pretty good because I'm not into car chases much and yet I still found them compelling in this movie. Queen Latifah's performance was good considering I didn't even go to see the movie because of her and yet I found she gave a lot of personality for the duo. *SPOILER* I had a problem with a small plot hole towards the end of the movie where Gisele's character agrees to accept a hostage trade of a young almost helpless teenager for a more competent well trained police women who possibly could have only added more of a complication. It didn't seem to make sense as an advantages trade and more or less seemed contrived for the sake of the script, and found it to be weak story telling.</fullReview>

The original is copied in a very bad way and the translation from Marseille, FR to NYC could have been way better.In the original, the key role is a believable guy who. You'd think they picked him right off the street and put him on the set (which they did). The tuning of her taxi is really bad and again an unbelievably bad copy of the original in which the leading actor had enough street cred to do these kind of things.

Gisele hardly embodies beauty nor does she smell like a good actress. In fact she doesn't even pass as an okay one. Heck! even Britney Spears is Oscar material compared to her. Then add to the mix the ill-matched coupling of Queen Latifah and the dude who plays her boyfriend (what's his name from NYPD blue, you know, the one who hooked up with Garcelle Beauvais on the show). Henry Simmons. :-DAnyhow, the plot is as follows: Jimmy Fallon is a police officer who is more of a bad rash than a cop. He tries to do everything right by the book but he's the sort of unlucky kind of dude who makes Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean look sensible. Perpetual-cop-in-films Jennifer Esposito plays his boss and ex-girlfriend and Queen Latifah plays the unlucky taxi-cab driver who gets sucked into the web Fallon spins for himself when he gets in over his head and attempts to go after the pack of bank robbing thieves by himself.

This is, what I like to call Hollywood Hogwash, targeted towards 9-13 year old girls, and 12-14 year old boys, I wouldn't add this DVD to my collection even if it was given to me for free with a $100 bill inside. I find it very sad that a movie like this can actually be made and distributed. Five minutes into it and I can already name three things wrong with it, (1) The opening scene, with Queen Latifah doing stunts on the bicycle, Matt Damon as a super agent I can almost believe... (2) Queen Latifah in lingerie, a well pampered poodle is still a poodle, meaning a mutt's a mutt (3) then there's the scene where she's working on her taxi all night, in lingerie mind you, why??? when she's done, she's all clean, oh well, at least we were spared a shower scene!!!</fullReview>

OK, the plot may have been predictable, but it's still a fun movie and that's what I was looking for. Also, there is some overacting, jokes that fall flat, etc. but not many movies are perfect.

		<fullReview>Okay the reviews here are definitely mixed as it concerns this remake of what was a French film. In my honest opinion the frog version (slang for French) was boring.Unlike 'La Femme Nikita' vs. the American remake 'Point of No Return', this remake of Taxi was better than the French original by a factor of 10.Why, you ask? Well for starters there was the semblance of a plot, the cinematography was better, the character development was substantially better and the comic interludes were intelligently inserted. The remainder of the film, including the driving sequences and FX work was much more interesting than the original French version.Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah were an interesting combination but Ann Margeret as the alcoholic mother of Jimmy Fallon was pure comedic genius! I liked it but then again I like California wines better than French too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed TAXI - far more than I thought I would! Jimmy Fallon (Andy Washburn) and Ann-Margret (Washburn's mother) are hilarious, while Queen Latifah (Belle Williams) is the glue that keeps the movie on the road.Washburn is the try-hard undercover young cop, out to impress everyone who crosses his path. Yet thanks to his own clumsy over-bearing efforts is a laughing stock. Belle on the other hand is a cool, logical winner.

		<fullReview>I don't know what everyone else was expecting when they went to this movie but with the exception of a few negative reviews on the radio, I went in with no real preconceived notions about what it was &amp; walked out pleasantly surprised. My husband &amp; I cracked up through the whole movie &amp; so did everyone else that was in the theater with us, we thought it was really funny. I mean yeah, it was a bit slapstick in places &amp; forced in others but what'd you expect?I didn't realize Queen Latifah played such a big part &amp; I was delighted to see that she did, &amp; her man, phew, what a man, had me shoutin', GO BELLE! I haven't watched much of SNL over the past few years so I didn't know exactly what to expect from Jimmy Fallon, but all I can say is I was far from disappointed, he kept us chuckling until the very end. Overall, I loved the lighthearted feel of it, it was just good clean fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Funniest Movies Of The Year!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was great. If you think this movie sucked then you have little or no sense of humor. Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah rocked. This movie got the whole audience laughing at the theater I went to. This movie had a decent plot and good acting. I am going to buy this movie when it comes to DVD. Of course this movie had good hot girls in it but you got to think past that. This movie is not about how good looking the girls are. There was some really good car chases in it. You should see this movie. I hope Ebert and Roper give this one two thumbs up because this movie deserves it. I had a great time watching it. You should too if you have a good sense of humor and you love comedies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply,"Taxi" is awesome.I have seen the original "Taxi",and it's sequel,"Taxi 2",which are both in french,and let me just say that this remake is so much better than the originals.Partly because it is in English and you can't get the originals dubbed,but also because the cars are more modern and attractive and that the villains are sexy European women and not men(but that might not interest some of you). In "Taxi(2004)" the main plot is about a good detective(who is a bad driver),and New Yorks fastest cab driver.They team up to catch a group of female European bank robbers,whose get-away car is a BMW 760 that can change colour. If you like car films such as "The fast and the furious", "2 fast 2 furious","The Italian job(2003) and "The Transporter" you will love this, i know i own and love all those films and love "Taxi" also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Hysterical! I could NOT stop laughing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was truly one of THE MOST hysterically funny movies I've ever seen in my entire life. I saw a special screening in Manhattan, in October 2004, and I was in hysterics from beginning to end. I couldn't stop laughing! Queen Latifah was her usual classy self, and Jimmie Fallon was in top form. I don't want to reveal too much of the plot, because that would spoil the hysterical buildup of dramatic climaxes. The story is outrageously funny, and it was a total scream, all the way up to the last minute! I am fully aware that this movie got some negative and somewhat hostile critical reception. My advice is, forget all that critic garbage, and go see it for yourself. If you love wacky, hysterical comedy, you will NOT be disappointed! I promise you! This movie was mostly filmed in New York City, with the stunt scenes and race car scenes filmed in Los Angeles and Pheonix. The whole movie has a wacky, New York sense of humor about it.Just try it for yourself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed TAXI - far more than I thought I would! Jimmy Fallon (Andy Washburn) and Ann-Margret (Washburn's mother) are hilarious, while Queen Latifah (Belle Williams) is the glue that keeps the movie on the road.Washburn is the try-hard undercover young cop, out to impress everyone who crosses his path. Yet thanks to his own clumsy over-bearing efforts is a laughing stock. Belle on the other hand is a cool, logical winner. As anti-buddy's they play off each other to perfection; strained to begin with - she just wants her cab and this loser to go away - they develop a weird chemistry on the chase. The Washburn behind the failed bravado begins revealing itself when we meet "mom". Some of the funniest scenes in the movie ensue...

		<fullReview>If you want to see a movie for the only reason of getting glimpses of hot chicks and completely far-fetched car chases then "Taxi" would be your calling. However if you're looking for a film with any substance whatsoever then avoid this film like the plague. It's allegedly a comedy yet it lacks comedic performances. The only time anyone in the theater laughed was during the nitrous oxide scene and Ann Margaret's performance as Jimmy Fallon's mother. I swear that if you've seen one Queen Latifah movie you've seen them all. She is exactly the same in each and every one of them. She seems like a decent enough actress too which is why it's a shame that they need her to keep playing the same role over, and over, and over again. I'm sure she has some sort of acting range but I'm willing to say it's a safe bet that she'll never be able to utilize it. As for Jimmy Fallon, well he's basically the poor woman's Adam Sandler and I'm surprised as hell that he ever left SNL because I don't think he has what it takes to make it in Hollywood. Lastly, yes, Giselle Bundchen and Jennifer Esposito are hot but neither one can act to save their lives. This was a bad movie!Final Lashing:Movies: No way in hell!DVD Purchase: You've got to be kidding me?!Rental: If you say so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taxi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing bits and pieces of the original foreign language film of the same name, and I remember hearing about this remake from the appearance of the leading actor on The Secret Policeman's Ball 2006, next to EastEnders' Shaun Williamson saying how bad it was, so I had to see why, from director Tim Story (Barbershop, Fantastic Four). Basically Isabelle 'Belle' Williams (Queen Latifah) has recently left her old job to become a New York taxi driver, but being a speed demon she has cab modified to have turbo engine, but her real dream is to be a champion race car driver. This is derailed however by the appearance of overeager undercover cop Andrew 'Andy' Washburn (Jimmy Fallon) who has a knack for causing chaos and has no driving skills, despite getting a licence. He is chasing a trio of beautiful female bank robbers, led by Vanessa (Gisele Bündchen), and Belle ends up being the only witness in the case and the only accomplice to solve the crime. So begins a game of cat and mouse with the two most unlikely partners chasing the robbers, and only causing mishaps all over the place, and of course making Lt. Marta Robbins (Jennifer Esposito) more mad. After the lieutenant says enough is enough, and takes Andy's melted (by Belle's hubby) off him, he and Belle do reconcile, and she teaches him to drive a little bit, and in the end they of course get the bad girls and everything settles. Also starring Ann-Margret as Mrs. Washburn, Henry Simmons as Jesse, Christian Kane as Agent Mullins and Ana Cristina De Oliveira as Redhead. Latifah's ghetto girl one liners are wasted, Fallon is a complete waste of space, the chase sequence don't make any difference to how bad it is, I remember giggling once, but only once, the story has absolutely no laugh out loud moments, a stupid action comedy. Pretty poor!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow...a movie about an inept cop that has little plot and story development, low performances and some skimpy dressed models.This is a dismal failure on the comedy aspect.There was no funny and no surprise.The entire story was so stupid and flawed that to sit and sit through it without trying to kill yourself is more thought provoking.There is actually 20 seconds of surprise in this movie, and it happens when the models almost get caught with their car - but that's it...20 seconds later, you feel very cheated again.This movie fails.Having not seen the French version, I can't compare it to anything - except what should be something to be able to entertain in itself - and it doesn't do that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well it wasn't horrible....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jimmy Fallon should NOT have left SNL. Either he wasn't ready to be a leading man or he never will be. Ironically, Queen Latifah saves this movie. She is very at home in her character, which makes her easy to watch. Fallon is just too over the top, even in a film like this. Remember - the movie centers on a group of four bombshell Brazilian bank robbers/models being chased by an inept cop who can't drive. The movie wants to be like "Speed" but funny. Sad truth is that I would have preferred Keanu Reeves instead of Fallon. He was just plain annoying. All that being said, the film was watchable. It was in no way, in my humble opinion, as horrible as many reviewers here would lead you to believe. I was entertained. The car sequences were interesting, to say the least, even if totally far-fetched. OH, and Belle's love interest, very easy on the eyes. This is no masterpiece. It fits in the typical funny cop genre, mixed with the crazy car chase/fanatic twist. It wasn't that good, but it could have been worse, so I gave it a 6/10. If you take it for what it's worth, you might be moderately entertained.</fullReview>

The original Taxi is a cool, funny, and action packed movie, while this one is just BAD. They just didn't get the "vibe" of the movie at all and the characters have nothing to do with the original ones, and what is that modding of a NY taxi cab??!! the peugeot of the original movie is at least a "tunnable" car, (and French obviously) but a NY cab?, c'mon... Just see the original and stop there, why make it American. Vanilla sky is the same, just watch Abre los ojos it's way better!! Not to mention Japanese movies like The Ring or The grudge...

		<fullReview>If you are a Gisele Bundchen fan, you better have seen this movie. If you don't know who Gisele is.... shes the most beautiful women on the planet.. She makes this movie a ten. OK OK.. this movie wasn't the best movie .. not even close.. but it was entertaining. I left the theater in a good mood. Maybe it was because of Gisele, but maybe because i was entertained for an hour and a half. For one of jimmy Fallon's first movies, he did a pretty decent job. He played a good Geeky cop, and queen latifa was a good side kick. Because the two are totally different, it made it such a dynamic pair. The inclusion of her being a nascar freak??not a good idea. And the beginning of the movie with her(stunt man) riding the delivery bike? cmon.. who actually would believe that she could do that, and that stunt driver wasn't exactly queen's size. The cars in this movie were pretty kick ass too.. And the fact that hot models were driving them.. makes it even better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So underrated that it's difficult to take most of the other reviewers/voters seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After five years of waiting, Belle Williams (Queen Latifah) is finally getting her hack license, and New York City had better watch out, because she makes the typical New York cabbie look like a driver's ed poster child. At the same time, Washburn (Jimmy Fallon), a bumbling New York City policeman, has just had his license taken away after totaling his third police car. When Washburn hears of a nearby bank robbery over his radio while walking a beat, he commandeers Belle's cab, and a new, extremely reckless partnership is born.Surely, something bizarre is going on with the mainstream public opinion about this film as of this writing. While I can understand someone not thinking that Taxi is the best thing since sliced bread, it's unconscionable to give this film a 1 or 2. Anyone rating this film so low can't possibly be looking at the "whole picture", so to speak, or they must be watching with a ridiculous set of preconceptions/expectations.When you rate a film, you have to consider the whole package, as an artwork. There's a lot more to it than whether you like the story or not, whether you thought it was funny or not, or whether you think it's realistic or not. For example, the cinematography in Taxi is incredible. Just the opening sequence alone, featuring "Belle" on a high speed, stunt-filled messenger bike ride through New York City makes the film worth a few points. The camera work and staging are stunning. There are all kinds of unique, subtle touches in the scene, like the shot of traffic where only the cabs are in color at first.It seems that a lot of people don't like the film just because it's a remake of Gerard Pires' 1998 French film of the same name, or just because it's a Hollywood film, or just because they've changed the gender or dispositions of the characters, or because they're misunderstanding the idea of comedy and expecting realism. None of those facts make this an inherently bad film. The idea is that you're rating/reviewing a film, as an artwork, not making a political statement or rating cultural facts that have nothing to do with what's on the screen. I disagree that fiction is necessarily making claims about how the actual world happens to be. Especially comedy cannot be just realistic and still be funny. To be comedy, something has to be absurd, exaggerated, made ironic, and so on. In general, I'm not looking for realism in films, even though Taxi has some very interesting and funny jabs at the real New York City. There are people like Belle and Washburn here, even if less comically exaggerated. There are cabbies who drive like Belle--I had the misfortune of riding home from the Newark airport with one who was going 100 mph (160 kph) while weaving in and out of traffic, often straddling two lanes. I've seen a number of people use Washburn's method of parallel parking (that's one of the reasons I pay for a garage instead).A lot of people here live in converted warehouses, industrial spaces, and so on, often "illegally". Apartments are so expensive that this is often the only alternative. So it's not only funny and in character that Belle sleeps right next to her car, which she would rather work on in the middle of the night before she attends to her boyfriend, it's not that far removed from reality. If you did happen to be looking for realism, the film has plenty.But Taxi is fiction, after all, and often cartoonish fiction at that. That's to be expected in much comedy. The opening bicycle ride isn't only amazing technically, it's funny _because_ it's supposed to be Queen Latifah on that bike! Jimmy Fallon's character was hilarious to me. He's a Clouseau-like bumbling nincompoop, but with a different kind of self-awareness that he's trying to veil with that special New York City "street tough" veneer. It perfectly skewers the public face that most people put on in the city. Latifah and Fallon complement each other in many ways. It was a pairing that I would have never thought of, but it is brilliant. There are a large number of scenes that will stand out in my mind for a long time.And as good as Fallon and Latifah are, Ann Margaret, as Washburn's mother, nearly steals the scene every time she appears. She's a lovable drunk with an amicable, libertine outlook. Her apartment is a delight of tacky 1970s fashion, which brings up another exemplary technical aspect of the film--the production design.But Taxi is also an exciting action/crime/thriller. The car chases often come close to those of another fantastic, unjustly underrated film--The Fast and The Furious (2001). The stunt driving is amazing. While the crime plot certainly isn't the focus of Taxi, it's more than just a throwaway device to propel our protagonists through their character development.I'm not arguing that everyone should come away from Taxi believing that it's a 10 as I do. Tastes differ, and these characters, or these actors, in these kinds of situations with these personalities, as well as this kind of pacing, fancy camera work, etc., could be not quite to your taste. But the extremely low scores from some only show that those reviewers aren't taking their assumed role as film critics seriously (this is even true of some professionals--just read Roger Ebert's review of this film), and if they're not giving that much respect to the artform they're engaging with, it's difficult to see why anyone should give much respect or consideration to their views. To say that a film like Taxi is anywhere near the technical incompetence of a film like Back Woods (2001) or The Black (not Blair) Witch Project (2001), which is implied when you rate the film a 1 or 2, is beyond reproach.</fullReview>
