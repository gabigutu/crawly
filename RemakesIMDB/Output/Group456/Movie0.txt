		<shortDescription>A great film all round!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion this is the one of the best mainstream French movies in a long while. I know that for many of us subtitled French movies are not regular choices. The film didn't break any UK/USA box office records (presumably as people were put of by its subtitles and french origins) which is a real shame. Well why should you give this one a try? Here goes...The movie was written and produced by Luc Besson, director of such films as Leon (aka The Professional in the USA), The Fifth Element (with Bruce Willis), Kiss of the Dragon (with Jet Li and Bridget Fonda) and Nikita (aka La Femme Nikita in the USA).The story follows Daniel, a moped pizza delivery guy who has worked to fulfill his dream of becoming a Marseilles taxi driver. He has tuned and tweaked his own taxi into something a little special... something a little out of the ordinary... I don't want to give the game away so I'll leave it there!The film is a fast paced thrill ride that crosses the boundaries of action, comedy, romance, farce and buddy movie amongst many other genres. The characters are likeable, the humour is quick and snappy and the driving is fast and furious (some of the best chases seen on screen for a few years). After a short while you barely realise that you are reading the subtitles. The storyline may not be particularly original but it is well executed overall. The soundtrack is funky and fits in perfectly with the film.It's not Shakespeare, but it never sets out to be Shakespeare. So if you are looking for a nicely shot film, suitable for just about anyone, give it a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proves that the French just do it better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is fantastic. It is simply an all action car chase romp set in the French city of Marseilles. The acting is highly convincing, the direction is fresh and modern and the film is easily the best car movie in years. Followed by two sequels, the film makers have kept the film very French without resorting to American-style CGI effects or bland super star actors. As a French speaker, I watched the film in its original language with subtitles in english incase I got lost. I would recommend watching the film in French to everyone, it's much better than the dubbed version. One of France's biggest films of the modern years, let's hope they keep the sequels rolling on!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why do people take films such as this SO seriously. Besson doesn't have to make the same film every time, he might want to do something for a laugh at some point, and that's what he's done here. The film is COOL to the maximum from the setting to the acting to the location to the soundtrack. It is a well rounded little baby of a film that Besson has knocked up in his spare time and just proves what an all round top bloke he is. Go see this film with an open mind and you can't fault it simple easy clean storyline lets the movie flow and move easily and when you stack on the petrolhead action on top of the layer of humour (which was okay) and put between good start sequence and highly amusing plot ending bread, you've got a veritable good movie sandwich. Once again French film is proven to be quite brilliant. Give this to some blockbuster US outfit and they'll create some half-assed dross that feels like walking through bubblegum. Instead its quick, slick and an all round top flick. Only the Italian Job comes close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally avoid action films and car chases bore me, but I watched Taxi on a friend's recommendation and have to say that it is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. Everything about it is pure class which may be something to with it being French. The premise of the film is beautifully simple - a speed-freak taxi driver Daniel and an inept policeman have to work together to catch some bank robbers. The relatively trivial nature of their mission is the perfect vehicle (excuse the pun) for the ever-so French humour of the script. They aren't out to save the world or stop evil for the good of all mankind (as is too often the case in American action films), but both want to stop the criminals for their own purely selfish reasons. In this setting the witty banter of the heroes is perfectly natural, especially compared with the cliched one-liners said in the face of doom found in most films in this genre.A mismatched pair of heroes is pretty much standard in action films (Lethal Weapon being the most famous case), but here is works well as they manage to be more than just stereotypes and are believable even if their circumstances aren't. Both characters come across as real people, flawed, but likeable, especially the roguishly charming Daniel.Despite being an action film, special-effects are kept to a minimum and although they are a large part of the film, the high speed car sequences are never self-indulgent, peppered with humour and brilliantly directed so as to hold the attention of even of the most "seen it all before" viewers (i.e. me). All in all a refreshing change from Hollywood comedy or action films and one which I would happily watch again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice French action comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written by Luc Besson (director of 'Léon' and 'The Fifth Element') this French film is funnier and with better action than most American blockbusters. It tells the story of Daniel (Samy Naceri) who starts as a taxi driver. He is an excellent driver but he never rides by the rules. With the police his taxi is famous, although they have never caught him or even seen a license plate. One day Daniel takes a woman Camille (Manuela Gourary) to her home and she says she will keep his card to call again. She does when her son Émilien (Frédéric Diefenthal) needs a ride. Daniel, who thinks Émilien works with IBM, of course disobeys all the rules and at the end of the ride Émilien reveals his true identity.Fortunately for Daniel the police has some trouble with a Mercedes-gang. Bank robbers who even inform the police before they rob a bank, with a Mercedes as the getaway car. Since Daniel knows much of cars he can help Émilien solve the case and keep his drivers license. Émilien desperately wants to solve this case because he wants to impress Petra (Emma Sjöberg), the girl he is in love with but always looks down on him. Daniel agrees since his driving is his life. He has to miss a lot of quality time with his girlfriend Lilly (Marion Cotillard) for this.I agree with you if you say the story sounds familiar. That part is not very original although it has some original touches. Daniel, for example, was a pizza delivery boy before he started his job as a taxi driver and the early scenes that deal with this fact are a lot of fun to watch. But the story is not what 'Taxi' is about. It is about funny moments and some good action. I have to admit there are plenty of funny moments, every scene between Daniel and Lilly is terrific, the action looks good and the cinematography for this kind of movie is perfect. Although the character of Daniel can get on your nerves, a little too much of a wise guy, Samy Naceri does a nice job portraying him.In the end I enjoyed this movie very much. The clichés and simple choices sometimes (the bad guy grabs his gun the minute Émilien reveals himself as a police officer who wants to ask some questions) can not spoil the fun the movie has, and therefore the audience. Don't expect a 'Lethal Weapon' but it is not that far from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has some of the best car scenes ever filmed. The thing that make them so great is that they are filmed on the road in citys and not on closed racing tracks.Not only the driving is superb,but the way it is filmed just makes you wanna stand up and shout "bravo".The down side of the movie is that it has a very bad plot and some boring scenes.But it is all worth it when the car scenes come. The dialogue is sometimes very funny and so is the french police.So if you like fast cars and incompetent police officers then this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A most excellent film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought this film by accident, not realising it was French, and when I did I just stuck it in a cupboard and thought I'd pass it off onto someone else. Some months later I actually open it up and stick it in, thinking I'd may as well see what I'd bought.I am VERY glad I did, this film is excellent, and put me onto the path of discovering foreign cinema by starting at the best. Sure it may not have the high budget thrills that Hollywood seem to think are necessary in such films but for breathtaking action and some hilarious comedy moments Taxi is amazing. Filmed on location for a lot of it, there are some stunning shots of Marsielle, the marina and countryside etc.So for brilliant action, comedy, and a fair bit of sexiness, Taxi is an ideal film. Tres bon!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very Gallic film indeed, but as a fan of French cinema - and of the French in general - I have to say that I enjoyed this film very much indeed. The plot is, I admit, weak in places. That doesn't matter though - this film isn't about cerebral entertainment, it's about car chases and jokes, and humour is something the French do very well. The car chases are spectacular - and far better, for my money, than the car chases featured in Gone in 60 Seconds, The Matrix Reloaded or The Fast and the Furious. Hollywood could do a lot worse than look over the Atlantic to see how car movies are made. Unfortunately, it now seems that they have but I didn't mean that they should copy the French, they need original ideas, but they also need to imitate the French flair. The jokes come thick and fast, and had me howling with laughter - it takes a lot of humour for me to forgive an absence of plot - this film has it in spades. So there you have it. Ignore the American rip off. Watch the original. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is developed in Marseille where a pizza delivery named Daniel, (Sami Naceri) drives a scooter, though he ultimately gets his wishes, a taxi license. The foul-mouthed cabbie join forces with a bungler inspector, a loser named Emilien(Frederic Diefenthal). Daniel is the fastest cabman with an attractive fiancée(Marion Cotillard), while Emilian goes after a gorgeous Inspector woman(Emma Sjoberg) and commanded by chief Commissaire(Bernard Farcey). The police Inspector is a complete inept behind the car and under skirts his mother. When Daniel is caught for speed infraction, then he's forced to collaborate with Emilien. They pursue a gang of violent German banks robbers and when they are on the heels of the band , the crooks drive a speed demon pursued by the taxi in a fast and furious race cars. This action-comedy film chronicling the relationship between the narrow-minded cabdriver and a botcher cop.The motion picture blends action packed, cars pursuits, humor, shootouts, rip roaring and is pretty amusing. From the start to the ending the action pace is fast moving, provides fast and furious entertainment with spectacular scenes.Displays nonstop action and is extremely bemusing and hilarious. There are chases galore in breathtaking velocity and with impressive finale race cars, filmed by magnificent stunts and excellent visual effects. Luminous cinematography and adequate musical score fitting to action by Akhenaton. The picture is lavishly produced by great producer and director Luc Besson and well directed by Gerard Pirés. Followed by three sequels : Taxi 2(2000), Taxi 3(2003) y Taxi 4(2007), all directed by Gerard Kraczyc and same actors and an American version with Queen Lafitah and directed by Tim Story. The flick will like to adrenaline lovers and those young people looking amusing and strong emotions, It's a must see for the cars buffs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An OK French comedy!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Daniel is an aging pizza boy with only one thing on his mind - speed. For the past six years, he's waited for one day, and its finally here.the day he gets his taxi license. With his ride already souped up, Daniel is out on the streets in no time breaking speed limits. One passenger turns out to be Emilien, a bumbling police inspector who busts him. However, instead of sending him to jail, he makes a deal with Daniel - if Daniel helps him catch a gang of bank robbers, then Daniel's record will be wiped clean. Now the two must team up to stop the Mercedes Gang before they get away...again.Taxi is one part racing, one part buddy cop flick. The formula works well here, though there's less racing than I would have liked. The movie is entertaining throughout, though the storyline remains a bit on the thin side.Conclusion: It is an OK French comedy/action. Fun to watch but might be rated fairly. I mean this movie is not very bad and not very good. This movie is on the middle side.</fullReview>

A thrill packed, speedy comedy. The car chases were superb and the French humour translated perfectly. I thought the subtitles might get in the way, but I was wrong. Half of the time you didn't even need to read them. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the thrill of driving fast and comedy thrown in for good measure.

		<fullReview>French movies almost always appeals to me. There is a playful attitude to film-making in France that make their movies enjoyable even when the plot is paper-thin and the premise far from fantastic.The Taxi-driver Daniel dreams of becoming a race-driver. But in the meantime he plagues the streets of Marseilles with his severely customized Peugeot. When robberies are being made by criminals in high-speed cars, the police enlist the help of Daniel and his car.The plot is, like i said, nothing new. But still this movie is an entertaining ride, filled with both good portions of comedy as well as car-chases. The actors mostly do their parts, even though i feel the acting leaves a bit more to wish for. Especially Samy Naceri in the lead is more annoying than fun. Bernard Farcy as the police captain is hilarious though.I recommend this to people who like watching car-chases and fast-paced light comedy. It might not be revolutionary, but it's fun. I rate it 6/10.</fullReview>

The car-chases are really intense, you really get the expression that the speed is up. The humor might not be intelligent, but it's still a lot better than what you see in the majority of American action-movies. What really makes this movie a banger is the sound-track: French hip-hop at its very best. Like the genre or not, it really fits well into the movie. "Gentlemen, start your engines..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Comedy Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew TAXI was a French film with a screenplay by Luc Besson but that was all I knew about it . I speculated that since it was written by Besson we'd be seeing a very violent thriller but that's not what TAXI turned out to be since it's an entertaining comedy Pizza delivery boy Daniel Morales drives his own unlicensed taxi and one day makes the mistake of driving ( In his own illegal manner ) Emilien to his place of work which is bad news for Daniel because Emilien is a police inspector . Daniel is given the choice of helping the police catch a bunch of German bank robbers dubbed " The Mercedes Gang " or lose his driving license Did I say this was entertaining ? It's also very likable and much of that's down to Besson's screenplay which is devoid of the sometimes sickening violence which did spoil for me NIKITA and LEON and they only hint that it was written by Besson being the fact that policemen are stupid . You do get the impression from all of his movies that Besson has a pathological dislike of cops but thankfully he doesn't get too polemical this time . Director Gerard Pires complements the screenplay by casting two young and likable actors in the lead roles There are a couple of flaws to TAXI . While being the chase and crash sequences are well directed it's unlikely cars flip up into the air as seen here . There's also a plot hole in that if the cops know where the raids are going to take place they don't bring in helicopter surveillence , but again being a Besson script the police are portrayed as being terminally stupid so I don't know if it's a plot hole as such . One thing that did annoy me is Daniel and Emilien sharing a joint which is a scene that certainly wasn't needed in the filmBut I saw several films the day I saw this and TAXI was undoubtedly the best movie I saw that day . It's not too difficult to see why the French film industry has been so successful over the years</fullReview>

I'm not a fan boy, but i do love this film. Although I do know that it is hard to find an English Dub, I enjoyed this film in Russian. Russians tend to dub more French films then America.The story is of a useless cop who freezes when he gets behind a car's wheel, and then on the other side we have Daniel who was a pizza legend driver of scooters until he finally got his taxi license and decided to become a taxi driver, as the two meet in a lucky circumstances Daniel is forced work for Émilien. The two become friends in their struggle of having a social life and form a bond.The film has great chemistry between all of the actors, and incredible driving scenes. in my opinion better filmed and better executed then the Fast and the furious films.If you get the chance to see this film either Subbed or Dubbed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe French movies aren't that well known in the world as American movies, but that doesn't mean they are worse. People usually are sceptic about watching films witch aren't from Hollywood, that's why many great French comedies were remade in Hollywood, but I think that people should give it a try, maybe those movies are made on a lower budged, but that doesn't mean they are less entertaining. Taxi is a typical French action movie. It has a lot of action sequences (in this part only shoot out's and car chases and they were all great), some comedy, style, great music and everything else what a great action flick needs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Luc Besson's Taxi is probably the best movie to have come out of France since...Jean Reno is Wasbi. Hollywood movies now days have well over-the-top action sequences with massive explosions and twists and turns. But however this is different, its reality based just pure fast fun with nothing wasted. The comedy is funny , the action is sharp and precise but the dialogue might be a little shaky and also there is an underdeveloped bonding plot which lets be honest not Luc Bessons best work. But where he success is seen is in the fact this is a fast paced action movie which is beautifully shot with that makes you realise that this is an cool action movie that makes Hollywood movies just look dull. A must see for both petrol heads and fans of action movies as well as foreign movies. When the french get it right ! they are spot on !</fullReview>

There are also a few running gags, that ran through the series (or at least some of the follow-ups), that started here, one involving the cab drivers girl friend. The storyline could've gone wrong, but it ultimately worked out (at least in the first installment).

		<fullReview>Taxi is a very good French film. It is enjoyable in almost every way ? it has some action, some romance, some terribly amusing scenes and a very nice ending. Taxi has unfortunately received very little international exposure, although an inferior film based upon it was made and released in America.The film starts with a fantastic opening sequence showing somebody riding a motorcycle dangerously and quickly with some great music (don't know what it is, but it's also in Pulp Fiction). It proceeds to show some amazing motorbike stunts, and then the main storyline gets underway.The storyline is implausible, yet fun to watch as you don't have to take it seriously. Daniel (Samy Naceri), a motorbike pizza delivery guy graduates to the role of taxi driver instead. He is a skillful driver and loves to go fast. Cue for many scenes of Daniel driving his taxi (a while Peugeot) extremely fast. Daniel is actually too fast for the speedometers, but he unwittingly gives a ride to cute policeman Emilien (Frederic Diefenthal). Emilien can't drive but he can arrest people; although he is not spiteful, Daniel's speed was so fast that he has to haul him into the office. It's there that they make a deal, involving Emilien keeping Daniels' licence, but allowing Daniel to continue driving as long as Daniel drives Emilien around and help him solve a mystery of German bank robbers that seems to be driving the whole police force crazy.This hilarious storyline will keep you entertained enough, but fortunately there are also several amusing subplots. Daniel and his girlfriend keep trying to go to bed but keep being interrupted; Emilien is after a girl at his work; Daniel insists on racing the German robbers?there are also small amusing scenes featuring the police chief, some pizza delivers and car thieves. The cast work together so well and are fantastically engaging.I highly recommend this film as both a comedy and an action film and certainly recommend it above the American re-make.</fullReview>

Daniel is now a taxi driver, but dreams of being a racing driver. And boy does it show! Driving one man to the airport Daniel clocks over 200kph!Emilien is a police officer, taking his driving test for the eighth time! He does well at computer games but driving in the real world, he just can't handle! But what is a police officer without a car.Traveling to work one day Emilien meets Daniel, recommended as 'the perfect taxi driver' by his Mother. And they go for a speeding ride around the city. But instead of arresting Daniel, Emilien has an idea. He needs a driver and a good one at that. Daniel is the perfect choice. So they make a deal, Daniel becomes Emilien's driver and he doesn't lose his license.Emilien and the rest of the police force are trying to crack a gang of bank robbers. Daniel's speed driving may just come in handy at trying to stop these criminals. But can they stop these daring thieves from committing more crimes?This is not only an action packed movie but it also has a good dose of comedy. Sure, it doesn't require the brain cells too much, but it's funny nevertheless. I really liked the car chases, very thrilling and fast paced. The music was also rather fitting.This is a top action/comedy movie, and I highly recommend it.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie tells us about a delivery boy, Daniel, who then turned out to be a taxi driver in Marseilles, France. He drives no ordinary car - a Peugeot 406 Sedan with a V6 engine and racing modifications. It was told that the car's so fast that even a speed gun can't detect the speed. After some fun, Daniel finally got arrested by a police lieutenant Emillien, who didn't know how to drive and failed driving license test for 8 times. In short, Emillien told Daniel that if Daniel wants to get back in his taxi, he must help Emillien to catch a Mercedes gang, a bunch of bank robbers that uses two Mercedes when performing the robberies. After a few failures to catch 'em, finally, with some help from Daniel's friends, they succeeded to arrest the robbers. Lots of fun in this movie, in fact, I choked twice due to laughing while eating popcorn. Lots of car chases also. Oh well, it's fast, it's fun, it's hell of a drive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once I saw the opening credits with a pizza delivery bike zipping through the streets of Marseille, I knew this film would be something special.This was the funniest film I have seen in ages. The scene where Daniel is ferrying the cop (who Daniel thinks is a computer programmer) at high velocity, in his souped-up Peugeot, whilst lambasting the police is hilarious! The humour is refreshingly non-PC (i.e. French!): for example Emilien (the cop) defends his profession's reputation by claiming "Not *all* police are drunkards, beating up immigrants!"The end of the film is very clever with an unexpected little twist - Daniel ends up with his ultimate embarrassment (which I won't mention).All in all, I would recommend this film to anybody, although especially to Jackie Chan/John Woo Hong Kong movie fans as a lot of the action sequences have a similar hyper-real feel to them (lots of single takes and no slo-mo).9/10</fullReview>

Being French there's no drivelish American sentiment or endless British posturing and class angst. Not a film to be taken seriously, its played for laughs and you don't really need the subtitles as most of the dialogue just flies by beneath the wheels of speeding Taxi's police cars and criminals on the Run.Think Cannonball Run meets BMX Bandits meets Touring Car racing and you've got the drift.</fullReview>

The somewhat pathetic police inspector is complemented well by the wisecracking, fast-driving taxi driver whom he is forced to work with (because he himself can't drive at all).Some may say that the movie has to much gas and not enough brains - so what? That's exactly what the movie was supposed to be, and it's done well. It provides laughs and action, and if you speak french, the french language version is actually a lot better and wittier than the subtitles.The soundtrack has some top-rate french hip-hop artists, and was a big seller in its own right. I just wish the movie was easier to find in video stores.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast, funny and French.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an amazing film right from the word go. You have to take most of it with a pinch of salt, but it is so funny. The comedy is very european so I doubt many people will get it and this may be the films down fall.The plot is simple, the super cool taxi driver, loses his driving license (for speeding). The only way he can get it back it to work with the people he hates most (the police).A chase/caper comedy film ensues. This film isn't all laughs but its definatly one of my favorite films of all time.If you like this film but would like to see something more serious (and French) take a look at "La Haine".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is a movie which could influence me for the way it made me happy and satisfied, this was it. The distribution story of this movie here in Portugal was really sad. Planned to be released directly to video in March 2000, it received a theatre slot and premiered guess where: only in a theatre in the outskirts of the capital, where it showed for a week. That made me sad, and meant that the video release would be postponed. And so it was, and only in February 2001 I managed to see the movie I was longing to see. What to say? It was magic, I never seen a movie with such an ability to pass its good-humored face to its viewers. I loved it: the movie is light (only a hour and a half, which makes us actually want to see more), fast-paced, simple but effective. The chase scenes are out of this world, and beat the hell out of, for example, Gone in Sixty Seconds. This proves that the french can do it, and with much better results: although the plot is paper thin, you won't really care when you see it, since you'll marvel at everything: Daniel's engaging personality, Emilien's cool silliness, the titular Taxi, which will make your jaw drop with its passive / agressive beauty, and that amazing finale, which made me rewind and see it again. Taxi is a movie which needs no intrincate studies or analysis: just watch it and get drunk on the laughter and good-nature it inspires. I watched this with my friends two times in a day, and never has a movie done this. Let's now hope Taxi 2 comes out on video when I'm still alive, but I see I will have to travel to France first to buy the DVD...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A technically perfect film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not expecting a lot from this film to be honest. Luc Besson is not a name that inspires that much confidence given the terrible Leon, lacklustre Fifth Element and excreble Joan of Arc but this is an absolute humdinger of a movie for its genre. Clearly Besson is happier with just a pen than when in overall control because this film excels in every way. The script is great: both packed with one liners and tightly (and often hilariously) plotted. I confess could only keep up with the subtitles - the characters talk like machine guns if you're not used to colloquial French - but the dialogue really sparkled.The cast of unknowns are also spot on. Samy Naceri and Frédéric Diefenthal are a great double act as Daniel the savvy, sexy speed demon taxi driver and Emilien the handsome but hapless non-driving cop. Marion Cotillard is drool inducing as Daniel's long suffering girlfriend Lilly and the aptly named Bernard Farcy is excellent as the prejudiced police chief with a penchant for stupid operation monikers.The film is very tightly shot with plenty of action (car chases and the like) but the witty script and great performances make it far more than your standard actioner. It also boasts a kicking soundtrack and some great set pieces. I cannot overemphasise how impressive this film is and it's a crying shame that, being French, it isn't more widely appreciated.</fullReview>

The outrageous characters, witty dialogues, and the excellent production provide great entertainment.

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable French action-comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This French action comedy is centred on Daniel; a new taxi driver who is obsessed with speed and Emelien; a policeman who keeps failing his driving test. The two of them are united after Daniel drives Emelien to work, not realising he is a policeman he drives like a maniac and tells Emelien what he thinks of cops. When they get to their destination Daniel is in for a nasty surprise. Emelien gives him a choice; he must act or his driver or stop driving altogether.The duo set about trying to catch a group of German bank robbers known as 'The Mercedes Gang' that is targeting banks in Marseilles. They have already struck once and are sure to strike again. Daniel's knowledge of cars helps them find the Germans but catching them in the act won't be easy. When he isn't driving Daniel tries to find time to spend with his girlfriend Lilly but that seems harder than catching the Germans.If you like your crime dramas gritty and realistic then this won't be for you; but if you want over the top action and plenty of laugh out loud moments this is well worth watching; it may be silly but it is a lot of fun. Samy Naceri and Frédéric Diefenthal do fine jobs as Daniel and Emelien and Marion Cotillard is good if somewhat underused as Lilly. The action, which includes numerous car crashes, chases and the occasional shoot-out is both exciting and funny. The laughs are fairly varied so, for example, if you aren't amused by the sight of two police cars crashing as they try to go through a narrow entry doesn't amuse you the idea of Korean cabbies working shifts so one sleeps in the boot while the other drives might. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting an action comedy with the emphasis on the comedy.These comments are based on watching the film in French with English subtitles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Taxi" is a movie that has to do as the title of it shows with a taxi which is different from all the others. On the one hand we have a taxi driver who is really obsessed with speed and on the other hand we have a loser police inspector who wants to be great and the best in his department. We watch those two try to catch some German bank robbers in order to succeed to their own goals.I liked this movie and I found it really hilarious because of the plot and the storyline. The direction which is made by Gérard Pir?s was outstanding. About the taxi I want to say that i found it beautiful and it reminded me those cars that we have watched on the James Bond movies. About the interpretations now, I have to mention the outstanding interpretation of Samy Naceri who played the crazy taxi driver and he was simply magnificent on it, Frédéric Diefenthal who played the loser inspector and he was equally good as the previous one. Of course in this movie we have the beautiful Marion Cotillard who played really good.Finally I have to say that "Taxi" is a great movie with which you will have a great time. I really liked it and I strongly recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you approach this in the right spirit there's much to be enjoyed though you won't necessarily want to revisit it within say five years or so. If you're coming to it for the first time in 2012 then Marion Cotillard is going to be the major selling point given that she is just about the only one of the cast that went on to not only greater but also International things and even with limited screen time she doesn't disappoint - plus it's as well to bear in mind that she was signed up for the sequel long before she picked up every gong in sight for her portrayal of Edith Piaf. The plot, if you can call it that, is clearly something that Luc Besson salvaged from Francis Weber's waste-basket centering as it does on two disparate males more or less obliged to work together for a given time; in this case we have our old friend the inept cop - think Jack Lemmon in Irma La Douce - who is totally incapable of passing a Driving Test and sees an opportunity to acquire his own personal street-wise driver when he strays into the cab of a totally fearless taxi driver. A highly organised gang of German bank robbers are making monkeys of the French police and from there you're on your own. This has got to be worth ninety minutes of any schoolboy-at- heart's time.</fullReview>

Now we all hope to seeing the next movie of Taxi again. Otherwise we have to look the older again.I think that the majority of German audience like this movie too. The movie is very funny.

		<shortDescription>That's not a car chase ...That's a car chase</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Daniel is a pizza delivery boy and as we join the film we see his amazing skill on the scooter as he takes us on a high speed low level tour of the claustrophobic Marseille streets. But this is his last day, from this point on he is exchanging two wheels for four as he moves up in the world and fulfils his lifelong dream to become a taxi driver, in his souped-up blistering mean machine. His leaving prompts him to make a move on the woman he has had his sights set on for some time, the ever beautiful Lily (played by the gorgeous Marion Cotillard) however their potential closeness is spoilt as Daniel has to report to the taxi office to pick us his license, promising her he would get back shortly.However this proves more difficult than he planned, and in truth, he isn't the only one with pressing problems. Emilien is a detective in the Marseille Police force and a gang of brazen bank robbers, called the Mercedes Gang, have announced that they are coming to town to perform some high speed daring robberies. Emilien has a chance to prove himself, but unfortunately for him, he needs to prove a lot as he is about as useful at detecting as he is at driving, which is hopeless. As Emelien enters Daniel's taxi neither of them have any idea who the other is, and as Daniel breaks just about every speed law there is, he is arrested, with his dreams of being a taxi driver in tatters. However, recognising that Daniel may just have the kind of high speed car knowledge that can track down the Mercedes Gang, Emelien teams up with Daniel in what is the greatest car chase film of all time.Forget Bourne for good car chases, after becoming familiar with the "Taxi" series of films I was left feeling that the chase in "Bourne Identity" was anything but impressive, in this film you feel every corner as the vehicles hurtle around it, every straight that allows the cars to accelerate beyond what you think is possible. The situations are hilarious and all the leads are performed with great energy and fun that give it that bit extra, and I deny anyone to guess the ending, I was amazed when I first saw it.So sit back, relax and take home a treat.Joyous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny French action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of us are familiar with the successful "buddy" Movies like 48 Hours and Lethal Weapon. Action and humor make a perfect combination, and it works in this film also.Director Gérard Pir?s keeps Luc Besson's (Léon, The Fifth Element, Nikita) tale moving right along. There isn't much to the tale (Besson reportedly wrote it in a month), but that is not important. If you look closely, the tales in the films mentioned above are pretty thin also.Daniel (Samy Naceri) is a delivery boy that wants to be a race driver. He gets a taxi and modifies it a la James Bond and goes speeding through the streets of Marseilles. That is, when he isn't with the lovely Lilly (Marion Cotillard) who manages to give us a quick view of her roses in the film.Caught speeding by the detective Emilien (Frédéric Diefenthal), he is recruited to help the police catch a German gang. These two work well together and we will get to see them again and again.Of Course, we would be remiss if we didn't mention Petra (Emma Wiklund), who manages to steal every scene she is in, and is the object of Emilien's desire.There is a lot of Pink Panther in the police portrayal as they bumble about relying on Daniel to save the day.The action through the city streets is pure fun and a delight to watch.This is entertainment at its best. No pretense of quality, but just good fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is basically some great nonsense to watch. It has an almost non-existent story, crazy action and a fast pace. It's the sort of movie that purely entertains and give you a good time, without trying to achieve anything else.Producer and writer Luc Besson's touch is definitely notable throughout the movie. It has the same sort of humor, pace and overall style as his directed movies. It's the sort of entertainment he himself could had directed.The movie is filled with some big fat deliberately overdone action sequences. It's done in such an overdone way that it becomes part of the comical aspects of the movie. On top of that the action, driving and the stunts are good and professional looking. Yes it- and the story are quite formulaic but it's executed in such a refreshing and fun way that it becomes original nevertheless.It's really one of those movies in which the story gets pushed to the back and you don't care about that. The story really is quite thin and not that well written but this in no way harms the movie or its entertainment value.It's definitely way better than the failed Hollywood remake with the same name. It didn't seemed to understand what it was that made this movie so entertaining to watch and it totally missed the mark in terms of entertainment.A recommendable fun simple movie.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Luc Besson is a genius writer. From Taxi to the Fifth Element you can't go wrong. If you haven't seen Taxi make a point to go and get it. If your fortunate enough to live near an independent cinema try and convince (hold hostage) the manager to show it for a few days. The experience is second to none.Sharp comedy underlines a very slick cast and performance from all involved. I can't praise Samy Naceri enough for his portrayal of Daniel the pizza boy turned cabby. Good looking car (Peugeot 406 V6) and an even better looking girl-Lilly played by Marion Cotillard who is also very strong in performance.All in all a great film that keeps you smiling from the start line to the chequered flag.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one goes way too fast to catch...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great send-up of all those Hollywood action movies you love to hate... or even love.The story is about how a nice young man (Daniel Morales played by Samy Naceri), who just wants to be a taxi-driver, got caught up with an idiot cop (Émilien, played by Frederic Diefenthal) who's trying to impress his boss (played by Sabine Bail) ? a busty blonde ? by catching the feared and frenetic Mercedes Gang of bank robbers who have now invaded Marseilles to clean out all the local banks. Got that? Well, what the hey. The story really doesn't matter: it's the action, pilgrim, it's the action... And there's plenty of it to satisfy the worst kind of action freak. Like me.The credits give a nod to Luc Besson for Writing, but I'll wager that he had input in other ways, particularly the brilliant car chases. And, if you think you've seen every type of mod to go fast, then wait for Daniel's Peugeot, although you have to wonder just how much of it is for real. The final chase is furiously fast ? I gave up trying to count all the crashed autos ? and the finish line is just the living end... as you will find out when you see the movie.Never mind, it all sounds good, it all goes good, and by golly, it delivers the goods.For 86 minutes of mindless action when you're dead tired after a hard day, this will perk you up. Great cinematography and editing combine to make this a treat provided you like crash-up, bash-up.And, don't miss the great stunts on the motorbikes at the start. Bravo to that also!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(r#61)It'd been a while since I last saw this movie, and I was worried that I saw it through rose tinted glasses - what if it wasn't as good as I remembered it? As the riveting Misirlou started pumping through the opening credits, I realized that I had been right - Taxi wasn't as good as I remembered it. It was much, much better.Daniel Morales (hilarious Samy Naceri) is a pizza delivery guy who is just planning to cross over into the world of taxi driving. He meets Émilien (Frédéric Diefenthal), a loser cop who can't seem to get anything right and is obsessively chasing a group of German bank robbers known as the Mercedes gang. Fooled into thinking that Émilien works at IBM, Daniel is caught red-handed practicing his very personal way of driving. Émilien lets him choose between losing his car or helping him, Émilien, to catch ze Germans. "That's like choosing between death and humiliation", Daniel says, but eventually agrees. Can his street smarts help poor Émilien to finally stop the Mercedes gang?The movie is filled to the brim with spectacular racing scenes. A pumping soundtrack helps, as well as the hilarious script (written by Luc Besson, one of my fave directors), which keeps the story going at a high pace that never lets up. Samy Naceri is hilarious as the sarcastic Daniel and Diefenthal is perfect as his pathetic character Émilien. These two also develop a fantastic chemistry that is rarely seen in this kind of buddy movie. Swedish Emma Sjöberg and Marion Cottilard are sexy and beautiful as the leading ladies, and Bernard Farcy is hilarious as the deliciously incompetent police officer. Overall this is a hilarious, fun summer movie that will definitely get your adrenaline pumping.Basically, everything that The Fast and the Furious tried to be. See it.</fullReview>

The chases and car-stunts are very well made and this film have some qualities that one don't see often in French movies.Finally a French movie without silly jokes about excrements...Even though this may not be the funniest film ever made, it leaves you with a very nice feeling and one almost wants to see it again right away! The story isn't the best, but the adaption of it is! Filming, direction and editing are all very good, and I must say that this is Besson's best movie for years!9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay so I was expecting Mr. Besson's signature, after all he did write it, so I guess all the action was not totally surprising. But what really made me feelgood about watching this film was the witty script and the comedic factor which prevails throughout the movie.The piece when "Daniel" hustles the Germans about their Mercs is worth the price of the ticket alone.

		<fullReview>On seeing this film you might feel that it's been done before, but this is a superb movie for one reason - it is just sheer entertainment all the way through! If you choose to ignore the fact that its a French film (which means those who aren't fluent need to use the distracting subtitles) and that it has a wafer-thin plot, you can have 89 minutes of enjoyment. What makes this film great is little things such as the camera angles and the music. The humor is good and so is the acting. This film has a touch of class which puts it above other films of this genre. The action high speed chases satisfies the guys and the hint of romance gives something to keep the ladies interested. A must see film that would have been an even bigger hit had it been a Hollywood production with the big-name stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to watch a film that is not going to require much thought or concentration, then watch Taxi. The film is a very simplistic and has little complexity in terms of plot and characterisation (the characters are little more than stereotypes and the ending is an anti-climax) and you can tell the screenplay took about 10 minutes to write, but it is one of the most enjoyable films I have seen for some time. It is still very 'French' and is an easy way into 'foreign' cinema for those of us who speak no other language than English. I watched it in the same evening as 'Z' by Costas-Gavras, and found both films very similar in style (so Gallic!!)Taxi is not the best film ever made, but you can easily escape with it for an hour or so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Luc Besson's name attached to this movie, you would think that Taxi would be an action movie like the great "The Professional" (aka Leon) or "The Fifth Element". It is NOT. It is pure comedy. Yes, there are some gunfights and car chases, but they are NOT portrayed as tense or thrilling like in most action films. The action in Taxi is always portrayed for comedy or looking "cool". It reminds me of "Blues Brothers". That movie also had big car chases but you would never consider it an action movie. Taxi is the same. It is funny, entertaining, and has pleasant actors, but just don't go expecting great action and you will be fine.</fullReview>

When I went to the cinema I was prepared to see an high speed film, but I wasn't prepared to the first frames of the film... I enjoyed it !!! I usually liked any Besson work, and hate french films, but this is a good comedy/action one. 70% action + 30% humor: a little budget and no great special effects, but only gags and real action ! Not a masterpiece, but a real entertainment. Like many Italian drivers I like the scene where Daniel (!) make the autovelox falling down on the street by a air movement caused by his car driven at 190KM/H in Marseille roads (with a lot of disappointment of cops).

The superb screen-shots when Daniel is breaking his own record in high-speed pizza-delivery on a scooter. I had to hold tight to the chair not to fall out. There was one disappointment with this movie, sometimes too much kissing etc. The actors are doing a good job. Being a techno-freak i loved the transforming scene. Seeing one ordinary 406 changing into a racing-car. The humor is typical french, i love it because I do speak the language. Very good work by Luc Besson.

This movie is *supposed* to be a no-brainer. It's supposed to be a wham-bam movie. And did it live up to that genre? Well, I'll say that this movie was better than "Speed". The two male leads in "Taxi" can actually act. And it is funny! You'll have to have a really weird sense of humour not to find the dialogue and acting hilarious! And, I admit, there are a lot of cheesy scenes...But that is the point! This movie isn't meant to be a serious film...it's supposed to be Entertainment. And believe me, judging from audience reaction in the theatre, it entertained all right! Why am I defending this film so ardently? I admit, it has TONS of flaws. But at least it has...Style. To borrow a phrase from Stephen Fry: "In a dunghill, even a plastic bead will shine like a sapphire." "Taxi" may not be an Oscar-material film, but as compared to the trash Hollywood calls "Action Comedies" these days, "Taxi" is a veritable classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>French "Fast &amp; Furious". Dumb fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're into car chases, explosions, senseless shootings in which nobody gets hurt, tall bosomy leggy beauties, nagging mums, bad Germans, dumb cops and Marseille, this film is your heart beating. If not... you will be watching your wristwatch, it'll be long 90 minutes for you.Don't expect anything close to believability and plot. The beginning's race of the pizza delivery (!) is creative, and adequate choice of music makes it part of cinema history. The other car chases, including of course the one with the German baddies over the short bridge, are what makes this film stand apart. Were it spoken in American English one would think this is popcorn cinema. Being directed by Luc Besson... I understand it's a French classic, maybe its biggest merit lies in the fact it's French, that they could wind up "being American" *(such a "French" obsession, by the way). Its drawback may be just that: it being French, I expected more: subtlety, intelligent humour, sociological points, dark, seedy characters. Instead, we get a good American commercial movie.Enjoy like a pink bubble gum.PS: Marion Cotillard looks gorgeous like a selfish gal, Frédéric Diefenthal overacts, but the plot makes it impossible not to, "Emma Wiklund" is an appropriate nymphet, whereas Samy Naceri is a surprise. He gives soul to a cardboard role. Mme. Gorary's Camille (Émilien's mum) gives adequate comic relief.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A pleasant but somewhat over-hyped buddy-action-comedy from France that became a huge hit, especially in Europe, and spawned three (to this date) sequels. To be sure, it has its virtues: likable characters, impressive stunt driving, stunning car crashes worthy of rewind &amp; replay, and some good laughs. But it's just too fluffy to justify all the hype about it. The comedy rarely makes the leap from "mildly funny" to "explosively funny". And the bad guys - a gang of fast-driving German bank robbers - are basically faceless and you can barely tell them apart. In any case, I'm suspecting that the sequels - with the set-up of Daniel and Emilien's friendship already done and out of the way - could possibly be better and I'll check them out. (**)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood Certainly Doesn't Make Them Like This Anymore!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood certainly does not, testament to this would be the 2004 hideous rehash involving Queen Latifa and some Swedish orientated girls performing the heist. The reason why the remake is so damned awful, is that Americans do not understand the subtlties of European humour, failing to realise that slap stick and obvious ploys to get women dressed in next to nothing do not work, nor does the ebonical slang that haunts many a film, spoken from stereotypical aggressive blacks. Anywho...I don't own many comedy films in the film collection, often the formula is repetitive, and certain films can only be endured a handful of times before coming tiresome, and placed in the back of ones collection to gather dust, to be left there until the time comes when DVD's are replaced by something else all together. Taxi, however, is a severely enjoyable romp, which I can find myself watching on a frequent basis as the film is just so damned entertaining.A Luc Besson script, but not directed by him, presents us with our two main characters, Daniel the greatest pizza delivery boy turned Taxi Driver, and Emilien the most bumbling police officer since Inspector Gadget. The humour is grand, and the difference between the two is highlighted from the very beginning. Daniel is the smooth charmer, from which the humour associated with him comes at the expense of those around him, whilst Emilien is the source of all the gags he provides due to his nature as a complete incompetent (this highlighted brilliantly in the scene where he is learning to drive). But do not let this fool you Emilien is a hard working honest man, and he is in no way handicapped, bar possibly his attempts of trying "too" hard.The humour is understated which truly makes this one of the greats. Everything is done so stylish and classily, there are no gigantic slapstick moments, or moments of humour based of vulgarities, the humour is exactly what humour should be, quick witted dialogue combined with precarious "sit-com"-esque moments. The film charts the progress of these two characters as Daniel is entrapped by Emilien and "forced" to work for him, as Daniel and the officers he work with, engage in various plans e.g Operation Cougar in vein attempts to capture the ever elusive and so wonderfully stereotypical German Mercedes Gang (what's in a name!). So the chase is on, and using Daniels modified Peugeot they formulate a plan to trap the krauts ("damn the special franco-German relationship"). This is truly a must for any fan of cinema. On a random note, I noticed one IMDb critic commented on the futility of the "joint-smoking" scene with Emilien and Daniel. Obviously the lad is American as marijuana is heavily frowned upon there (but you can drive a death trap at 16), but it merely symbolises their close net relationship, and how friendship is more important to the both of them, as the police officer can over look it, and indulge in this treat with Daniel. This is a rip roaring comedy which will have you in stitches come its unexpected finale, it certainly is one of the greatest pay-offs in film history, and if you don't agree, well I guess you can just stick that in your pipe and smoke it then, can't you?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're looking for a movie with an in-depth plot, don't watch Taxi. The plot is rather poor, but if you have a basic knowledge of the French language, you'll enjoy some rather funny dialogs. This goes also for the two other Taxi movies (Taxi 2 &amp; 3). If you're looking for a relaxing fun-movie with astonishing car-chases, this is something for you. The car-driving scenes are filmed in a really professional way and although in reality the cars are not driving extremely fast the montage gives a good feeling of speed and excitement. Just lean back and enjoy the fast cars and you'll have a great time. Another plus for this movie is the good music, the producers used some French hip-hop which fits the movie well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The taxi driving profession has never looked so good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in Marseilles in the South of France, this French crime thriller was penned by Luc Besson and concerns Daniel Morales (Samy Naceri) a pizza delivery boy who is at the top of the city's manic moped riding food chain but is hungry for more. Trading in two wheels for four, Daniel becomes a taxi driver but loses his licence after being caught speeding in an enthralling race across the city. To regain his licence he agrees to share his knowledge of cars and 'boy racer' attitude to help Inspector Emilien Coutant-Kerbalec (Frédéric Diefenthal) catch a bunch of German bank robbers who use a sporty Mercedes Benz for their speedy getaways. The film is efficiently directed by Gérard Pir?s and the story moves along at a steady pace, but suffers from shallow and unexplored characters. The German robbers, who demonstrate a high level of expertise, having never been caught, are depicted as a bunch of bumbling idiots who would rather race a taxi driver across the city than escape with a trunk full of loot. The robbers' menace isn't even hinted at by Besson who previously created such evil and captivating characters like 'Norman Stansfield' played by Gary Oldman in Leon. However in contrast to the flimsy cardboard cut-out bad guys, Daniel and Emilien build a good cop/rogue cop relationship which has Besson's eye for detail all over it. Daniel is a street wise, adrenaline junkie who benefits from Besson's flair for comedy. When a ruffled businessman who's about to miss an important flight jumps into Daniel's cab and asks if he can save his life, Daniel replies, `In theory, no. It depends. What are the symptoms?' If the man misses the flight, he's dead, he's told. Daniel hits a few buttons and his taxi is transformed into a mean looking racing machine, which tears off across the city, tires melting on the Tarmac. Emilien is a pedantic, paranoid but ultimately good-natured police inspector who begins to rely on Daniel for more than just police work when he seeks his advice in relationships and begs for his help after he burns down his own flat. The two constantly argue in true heated French style, yet grow to appreciate each other's personas. Emilien's mother, Camille (Manuela Gourary) and Daniel's girlfriend Lilly (Marion Cotillard) offer excellent support to the two male leads and Emilien's boss Police Chief Gibert (Bernard Farcy) serves up comedy, taking more pride in naming the different planned missions to catch the robbers than the actual missions themselves. At one briefing he tells the police team they are going to strike with deadly force in what he's named 'Operation Cobra' and in another he says they are to apply the principles of 'serenity' and 'efficacy' in what he's called 'Operation Zen'. For all his efforts, he fails miserably but provides an Inspector Clusoe type caricature which adds to the film's already strong cast and comic appeal The chase scenes, which are attractive to the tortoises as well as the hares among us, are almost too close for comfort as Mercedes Benz and Peugeot cars career through the narrow city streets and both carmakers benefit from a gross feat of product placement. Though Taxi is not a deeply moving crime thriller, its refreshing lack of testosterone and explosions make it far better than the big-budget, muscle bound Hollywood nonsense such as 'Gone In Sixty Seconds'. With Marseilles as an attractive backdrop, a convincing buddy relationship and some spectacular and realistic car chases, the taxi driving profession has never looked so good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven but Amusing Comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one can accuse this movie of being slow. All the multiple car chases aside, the editing is fast, the unexpected incidents are piled one atop the other, and the speech is REALLY fast. I think I read somewhere that the French take the palm when it comes to syllables per minute in the Indo-European League.Naceri is a brand new taxi driver who unwittingly takes a police officer for a quick spin at 120 klicks in a 30 zone. His punishment is to be swept up as a driver in the police man hunt for the Mercedes gang, a handful of Germans who drive scarlet Mercedes to each of their bank robberies and somehow escape.The police are constantly calling Naceri in for emergencies, interrupting his love-making with his girl, Marion Cotillard. The police detective, Diefenthal, is similarly interrupted at awkward times. Naceri finally figures out how the gang is pulling these stunts off -- it's a little tricky -- and out-drives and out-wits them, seeing to it that they're captured. Naceri and Diefenthal both receive decorations. Naceri is finally able to get together with his girl and Diefenthal, a schlub who has discovered self confidence, gets to make it with the blond giantess who works in his office.I was confused part of the time but laughed out loud thrice. I'm laughing as I write this because I'm replaying one of the lesser gags in my head. We've all seen vintage cop movies in which the police cars rush seriatim from their underground garage through a narrow doorway, sirens screaming. We see it here too, except that after a few police cars rush out of the garage door, two of them try to squeeze through at the same time and come to a sudden stop after crunching together side by side. It only lasts a few seconds but in this film nothing lasts much longer than that.I was a little disappointed though. The chief reason I watched this was the presence of Marion Cotillard, a sexy little gamin. I used to be in love with Madonna but it was, I now realize, only a "crush." Now my tastes have matured and I love Marion Cotillard. I have sent her innumerable billets doux and have received no answers. The girl is probably too shy, too reserved, to respond to my declarations of undying love. I enjoyed her presence immensely in "Public Enemies", in which she was a half-Indian French Canadian. Here, I'm afraid, her part is too small and she wears far too many hampering garments.The rest of the cast is just fine, in the sense that they can all speak more quickly than I can think. And, my God, you have never seen so many glossy new cars smashed to pieces on roads and highways. It's worse than L. A.Well, I'll give you another gag, just to add some of what the Japanese call the fifth sense of taste, savoriness or "umami", partly because I like that word. Diefenthal burns his house down by accident and he brings his mother over to Naceri's house to stay for a while. Naceri must leave his dissolute young girl friend with his elderly woman who enjoys only cooking. The two men must leave, but Cotillard is anxious because she and the other woman have absolutely nothing in common, so how can they talk? When the men return, hours later, they find both ladies laughing in an unbuttoned manner because they are thoroughly stoned on some Jamaican grass.If you don't expect a masterpiece and if you're prepared to pay close attention, you'll find this a successful mood-lifter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A charming change from the usual fanfare!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taxi was a refreshing change from the usual onslaught of Hollywood's big budget action thrillers and the deluded notion that "bigger and more extravagant is better." Personally, seeing a well filmed car chase sequence involving actual driving is more rewarding than watching actors pretend to drive in front of a green screen as CGI-rendered vehicles explode on contact left and right. If one was to believe Hollywood, every car accident around the world involves instantaneous explosions! Luckily, even though many cars do collide in this film, for the most part, they experience usual car damage. I love the tempo of the film since it never drags out or moves too quickly to follow. Best of all, the actors carried the film well and I thoroughly enjoyed the quick, witty banter between the characters of Daniel and Emilien. It's far more endearing and believable than many of Hollywood's cheesy one liners or over the top dialogues. If you're open-minded enough to try a foreign film in its native language, this is a great introduction. My only complaint would be the brief, unnecessary scene of nudity in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Due to sadly not yet seen any of the recent action films produced by Besson (though I have heard some very good things about the transporter series)I was looking forward to seeing how this production of his would be. Whilst it is a very likable light-hearted action film(no one gets killed in the whole film!)I just feel that it was just a bit hollow,and,a bit too light.The plot:A pizza delivery boy (daniel)retiers from the job,so he can do the job that he has always wanted to do,to be a taxi driver.Though,unlike all the other taxi drivers in the country,Daniel has kitted up his cab,to the level of it almost being an F1 car!.Due to this,he is able to speed pass any policemen,that are trying to catch people speeding.Unluckaly for Daniel,his fun gets him into trouble,when he unknowingly speeds,whilst having a police officer as his passenger.Whilst this should mean that he is about to lose his job,the officer gives him a chance to keep it,if he is able to help him catch a big gang of Mercedes-driving bank robbers,whose cars always seem to "dissapear",as soon as they flee from the banks...View on the film:The first thing that I have to mention,is the really enjoyable electronic score,that has a very calming smooth and breezy feel to it. A surprising thing about the film,is how nonviolent it is.And,though the story has got quite a bit of potential,with a very good premise,it is let down by the action/chase scenes not being given the adrenalin rush that they badly need.Which makes the film feel as if it is doing everything it can,to stick to the middle of the road.Final view on the film:An enjoyable,easygoing action film,with a fun storyline.</fullReview>

Oh well, they may be one of the rudest and most insular races this side of North Korea, but you can't fault the French when it comes to STYLE. France has produced some fine, even classic, movies, a fact born out by the number of domestic French films that have been remade into standard Hollywood fare and sold all around the world.Not only are there 2 French "Taxi" sequels (with a third on the way) but the original film has been remade in the USA as well. There's not doubt that the premise of this Marseilles-set movie has a turbocharger under the hood.Writer/Producer Luc Besson's script is a fine blend of romance, comedy and action and veteran director Gerard Pires (aided by Jean-Pierre Sauvaire's clever camera-work) coaxes fine performances from the talented cast.Even if your understanding of French is limited to "Oui" and "Non", if you like cars and knockabout comedy then you should give "Taxi" a go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average comedy action from producer Luc Besson.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Produced by Luc Besson, Taxi is a lightweight action comedy in which Daniel (Samy Naceri), an unsuccessful cop, joins forces with speed-freak taxi driver Émilien (Frédéric Diefenthal) to catch a gang of German bank-robbers.With plenty of crazy car chases, jumps, crashes and smashes, but little in the way of a decent plot, Taxi is the kind of undemanding fluff that has been done countless times before, and with far better results. The action scenes are not particularly memorable and the finale, in which Émilien enlists the help of his ex-co-workers from a Pizza parlour to help catch the criminals, fails to build to a satisfactory action-packed, adrenaline-pumping climax, instead ending with a ridiculous 'stunt' on an unfinished freeway that beggars belief.Naceri and Diefenthal work well together and they make the most of their clichéd roles, but even they cannot save the film from its hackneyed plot and pedestrian direction. Marion Cotillard, as Émilien's sexy girlfriend Lilly is also rather good, but for entirely different reasons; even if you're not particularly into cars, this Gallic hottie makes the film worth watching!A major success in France, Taxi has spawned several sequels and, of course, the obligatory US remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Taxi" is a very speedy action flick about a loser French cop and an anti-loser French cab driver who are forced to team up to arrest a gang of Germans, though they you'll never guess, contrast. The Germans outsmart them for a while (man that must be humiliating) but then all of a sudden, the two guys take care of business, get rid of all that stupid plot and get into car chases. Next comes an explosion you'd think, but nope, the climax is one hell of a lot funnier. I happen to remember this also had an American version, but that involved Queen Latifah and a lot of rap, so I'm staying with this one. It's just really well-made and ingenious. It managed to be funny, it managed to be exciting, it's truly the popcorn flick among popcorn flicks.</fullReview>

Nevertheless, the pace is good and the film does not portray itself as the greatest action film since Terminator.The love story with Emma Sjöberg is actually the only part of the story which degrades this film to a near B-movie status. If they had replaced that with more serious action, it could move closer to Ronin.</fullReview>

This movie shines with the lack of blah-blah typical of le film français--even La Femme Nikita couldn't help turning into a bunch of whining people. The other movie of the late 90's that tried to keep French audiences awake was Dobermann, which was a long nightmare exemplar of a director not knowing when to move on to the next scene. What is great about this movie's plot is that in the end, the speed racer does not resolve to firing guns or hand to hand combat which is typical of most Hollywood productions, but instead uses speed maniac mentality to outsmart the robbers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had expected this movie to impress me with good action scenes, and probably some good humor too; I was heavily disappointed. I knew it was about cars, but come on, nothing else? The movie consists of scene after scene involving cars racing. It might as well have taken place at a race track. The humor mainly consists of the main character constantly being kept from having sex with his girlfriend. The action scenes consist of a lot of people shooting, without it ever being very clear what the hell they're shooting at. Now, I'm not a big racing movie fan, in fact, I mostly hate movies that involve a lot of car racing, but some good movies involving cars have impressed me(The Matrix Reloaded, for example), but I must admit, the car scenes in this movie were simply nothing special. The plot is instantly forgettable. The characters are annoying. The stunts are nothing that isn't seen hundreds of times before. The movie is in no way entertaining, impressive, or just mildly worth your time. Skip this one, no matter how big a racing movie fan you are. I don't recommend this movie to anyone, unless they are so into cars that they can't stand the thought of not having seen every single movie involving them. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I rented this movie, I expected it to be as silly and juvenile as many French comedies are, but hoped that a lot of well shot spectacular car chases would make it worth watching. Unfortunately too much time was spent trying to tell a story or build up jokes which one could feel coming from miles away. There are in fact very few car chases in this film, so if you are into that you'd better watch "Ronin" instead (which isn't a good movie either, but it contains a really spectacular high speed pursuit on the French motorways). Furthermore, the unplausability of the story got annoying after a while. Normally I don't mind a willing suspension of disbelief, but the writers really didn't succeed in making it acceptable that a gang of German bankrobbers, who always use the same red Mercedeses and who announce which bank they are going to attack, can't get caught by the Marseille police force. The young cast is quite enjoyable to watch, but that doesn't compensate for the overall childishness of this product.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cars as an extension of masculinity as fast, kinetic action and buddy-relations are the order of the day in sunny Southern France.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gérard Pir?s' 1998 film Taxi seems to have been more inspirational than it deserves to have been, with three sequels since its inception; a woeful 2004 American remake plus, from what I've read, an Indian film named Dhoom which supposedly somewhat borrows from the overall narrative of Taxi. The film isn't a crushing disappointment, but for an 86 minute sprint to still feel like it outstays its welcome is not good, and the film is not the achievement everyone else seems to think it is. Penned by Luc Besson, he now of innumerable Americanised, rather daft French language films about not very much, the film is nothing more than an afterthought; a screenplay pumped out over the course of a month and sufficing on basic technical levels of kinetic action and would-be funny buddy genre banter. It's over the top and rather annoying.Taxi tells the story of a well off job-wise but clumsy, down and out cop named Émilien (Diefenthal) and a relatively poor, working class cab driver named Daniel (Naceri) who's actually at the top of his game in his own little world. The two come together when cop Émilien hitches a ride in Daniel's cab but books him for haring down the roads at a dangerous speed. Forced into working for the police in taking down some German bank-robbers through threat of a license ban, Daniel must subside into aiding. The distinction between the police and your average working French schlub is more prominent than needs be in Taxi, with most of the police officers or figures of authority in Taxi coming across as either woefully incompetent; easily duped or just generally somewhat pathetic ? it ranges from inept traffic cops, to stupid SWAT team members to blundering, elderly police captains. Indeed, taxi driver Daniel goes on at length at how he dislikes the police and enjoys insulting those that have signed up as well as taunting those who control speed traps. In stark comparison, Daniel is the young go-getter; with a car; girlfriend in Lilly (an early role for Marion Cotillard - the stuff you've got to star in to catch a break, eh?) and a place of his own he calls home.Whatever problems to do with the strange relationship France seem to have going on between youth and state still manages to worm its way into what is, on the surface, harmless and daft entertainment. No surprise then, that the youth turns out to be more qualified to do the task of going after these criminals than the state are. The film likes these characters, enjoys having them goad the enemy and have them banter to one another about whatever; but it likes the cars even more ? so much so in fact, that the process of transforming a bog-standard Peugeot into a souped-up and ready for action juggernaut is a process of distinct fetishistic transition: as Daniel goes through all the motions of flipping a buttoned turntable; raising the suspension; unveiling a spoiler; pushing out a bumper; the removing of one steering wheel and then the glorious re-attachment of another. A running joke is that Daniel finds time for a very small amount of foreplay with his girlfriend Lilly without ever actually following through with sex; his frustrations relieved by going through a set of familiar motions with his car before rampaging off at top speed, this after completing the transformation of the phallic automobile from natural and as you see it, into something else capable of maximum drive.It is in stark contrast to Émilien, who it is enforced early on cannot drive at all when he smashes into a shop front during a test, but this twinned with the fact he still lives at home; does not have a girlfriend, a trait that is enforced through repeated failed attempts to 'woo' female police officer Petra (Wiklund), and generally maintains an odd relationship with his mother, one ingredient of which sees her make snacks for him to take on his journeys. The reason all this is playing out is due to the aforementioned German bank robbers, a laughing; cackling; mocking; technically efficient; mostly Aryan group of thieves whom have robbed banks across mainland Europe and now target France. This plot device is obviously absolute nonsense, as there's no reason French SWAT teams cannot surround a bank which is in the process of being robbed and apprehend them. The bringing in of a nationalistic drive the French 'ought' to possess when the police chief mentions the Second World War is unnecessary, France being next in the firing line following banks in Holland and Belgium, two nations that were occupied as well as Italy whom were allied with Germany during The War, having already been invaded and robbed.Taxi's clear attempt to appeal to audiences of an overseas nature is evident in all the crashing and shooting and chasing, for sure; but its guiltiest example is when Daniel, who begins with a pizza delivery job but promotes himself to position of a cab driver, takes his first fare home after they've spent a day at the shops. The moment when we see a baguette roll sticking out of one of their shopping bags is sure to force those of an observant nature to roll eyes. Taxi looks at fighting fire with fire in utilising Daniel to help catch the thieves; I think we come to like the rouge driver that-is Daniel by the end, and want him to get away with escaping with his licence intact, but there's nothing really going on around him to get involved in and the chases are pretty unexciting as a whole - Taxi isn't a disaster, it's dumb B-movie fun which will work for some, but isn't really good enough on the whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ersatz of an already mediocre product.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is quite simply the french version of US blockbuster car movies.Knowing this, the average viewer expects a nonsensical, hole-filled plot and horrible dialogue; they go with the territory... but in "Taxi", stupidity goes to 11. So much so that, 20 minutes into the movie, my brain tried to strangle me.But that's not important in such a movie. What matters are the cars, car chases, a few mooks dying and the length of Angelina Jolie's skirt. This genre is entirely aimed at a young male's middle regions, it's not to be appreciated with the brain.Sadly, "Taxi" is lacking even in those respects: Angelina Jolie is nowhere in sight, the car chases are so impossible as to be comedic rather than jaw-dropping, and the dreamy cars replaced by... wait for it... a Peugeot. Yes, you read that right. No V8 Vantage, no XKR, no F50, no GT40, not even an Elise or 911; just a Peugeot. A Peugeot that, on the press of a button, sprouts spoilers everywhere, like the world's tackiest Transformer. I'd rather walk.Good acting would look out of place in this movie, so let's be thankful for the main cast's sub-par performance.Finally, the music. Well, it's all french hip-hop, which, just like the movie, is an ersatz of the American equivalent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film apart from it's weird and not very funny french humour, is nothing but cars transforming into SUPERcars... Something which might have caught my interest if I was 6-8 years old, which I'm not...I must admit there are some nice car-chases but I'd watch Jackie Chan's "Thunderbolt" instead...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be the biggest pile of pap i have ever seen in my life! Don't waste your time watching it! I found more entertain things in my kecks this morning. If the trend for cinema is like this then i'm never watching another film as long as i live, which hopefully wont be very long if this is supposed to be entertainment. If you do like this film don't tell anyone for fear of being attacked. Actually, cancel that, raise your hand and let us clear you from the gene pool so that we can make the earth a better place. The acting is on a par with the worst Arnie has to offer and the plot is so thin it makes Jodie Kidd look like Big Daddy (God rest his soul!). I just wish i had seen this film sooner so that i could have warned you all to stay well clear. This is clearly a film for all the Chavs out there that aspire to this kind of souped up peugeot lifestyle. Don't forget to put your Burberry caps on first folks! Apart from that, its great!</fullReview>
