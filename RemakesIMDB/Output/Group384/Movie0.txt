		<fullReview>This movie is just the best movie i have seen. (I have watched around 570 movies) (Its my favorite movie).It has all the elements that a good movie must have:Excellent Dialogues.Excellent Music.Excellent Acting. (Even the extra's where excellent)Excellent Story/Plot.Good Songs.And it has much genres, who are handled very well in this movie: Action/Comedy/Romance/Drama/Adventure/Thriller (not really, but a kind of Thriller)/Musical/Crime. Each word of this movie is excellent. I think it has the greatest story ever! I was hurted when i came to know that Mr. Ram Gopal Varma is remaking this classic... Despite becoming the most successful film of its time, it failed to win any major popular or critics awards. The lone Filmfare award it got went to M.S. Shinde for Best editing. The plot is about a retired police officer Thakur (Sanjeev Kumar) who hires two convicts Veeru and Jai (Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan) to capture Gabbar Singh (a Dacoit) who had killed the cop's entire family (except the cop and his daughter-in-law).Who has not seen this movie, try it once, you will love it. *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you liked "Once upon a time in the west", "The magnificent seven" and "A fistful of dollars", you will love "Sholay". It takes all the good ingredients of a western, spices it with a lot of Indian ingredients and lets it simmer until you get one of the finest "curry" westerns imaginable. Though obviously very much inspired by the "spaghetti" westerns of the late 1960s/early 1970s, this easily surpasses most of the films it's modeled after. A masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No film before or after Sholay has achieved as much - running to full houses in an unbroken 6 year stretch! Consider the fact that this happened in India - where the audiences have the most choices amongst all the people of the world. Consider the fact that no movie anywhere in the world has been able to reap even half this success that Sholay enjoys.It is potent, does not pretend, and has clearly been made with courage and conviction. It was made for the enjoyment of its predominantly Indian, fun-loving audiences, so my dear detractors from the clan of the perennially cynical, reality-fed, fun deprived masses of the world, kindly excuse yourselves. Sholay is quintessential Mumbai produce - you either consume and enjoy in total acceptance, or you're not fit for the ride. It is as simple as that.The world would be a poorer place without films like Sholay, not only because of the almost arrogant instantaneous and total suspension of disbelief it demands from its audiences, but because of the honesty and sheer power of that demand. You go to a boxing match to see two boxers fight it out, not to see them playing chess in the middle of the ring!Sholay will always be an incredible and shining example of purity, because it was the purest attempt made to entertain, with absolutely no quarters even considered for critical acclaim from the so called pundits of cinema.Yours truly is guilty of seeing this film 23 times to date, 17 of these in the theatres. And if opportunity allows, I wouldn't mind being sentenced to death with more of this guilt delightfully added to my conscience.As with any other film, there have been many comments on what is wrong with Sholay. To these, here is my personal quote - "A good film is about getting most things right, not about getting the fewest things wrong!"And here is my response to other heartless comments on Sholay being a copy of some other film or filmmaker's work - "If every human was an original, we would have 6 billion different species without a single one to call friend or family".To argue against failure may be human, but to argue against success is sub-human. You may limit yourselves if you so wish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great Movie... Everyone should have seen this movie at least one time ! I bought this movie on DVD now, although I am not a big fan of elder films... i love this film, and especially the dialogs of GB ! For all Amitabh fans its a must have movie ! The whole story is really good and the movie has a flair of an American western. Even the sound of Sholay and the atmosphere which is given to the watcher are one of the best i have seen in Bollywood. I have heard, there will be a remake of this film, but I think it could not be as good as the original Sholay. All because of the actors like Amjad Khan who was born for this role. This film is one of bollywood's best movies ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Definitive Masterpiece...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a strong fan of the American Western genre and of course the directing of Sergio Leone, it is with great enthusiasm that i recommend Sholay to any audiences or fans of Westerns and Bollywood cinema.Perhaps, the greatest film in the history of Bollywood cinema (with one of the longest theatrical runs in Bollywood history), this is the definitive Bollywood action epic movie in the same way that Leone's 'The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly' was the definitive Western.The film features the acting talents of such Bollywood legends...Amitabh Bachan and Dharmendra and focuses at its heart, a story of friendship, courage and revenge, based loosely around the concepts of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai &amp; The Magnificent Seven.If you have not watched it, then make it your priority to watch it at least once in your life, as this is definitely one of the movies that every person needs to experience.A true cinematic masterpiece.</fullReview>

They are remembered even today in 2004 after nearly 30 years of the film release. I heard that this movie is now re-released with remastered sound. wow ! cant' wait to fetch the DVD of this remastered version.The most impressive role of Gabbar by Amjad Khan was portrayed extremely well. Its also one the longest movie. Its quite normal for bollywood movies to be 3 hours long. But this one is even longer than this. But certainly ever minute of the movie is enjoyable.This movie is my all time favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Story Ever Told!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Kitne Aadmi Thei", every Indian film fan knows this dialog by heart. Sholay was released in 1975, also the year I was born in, coincidence, perhaps. The film became the longest running Indian film in the theaters, a record that stood for over 25 years until it was broken recently by another classic "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" (holds the current record 500 Weeks and still going - as on May 07, 2005).Sholay was written by the great Duo of Javed Akhtar and Salim Khan know as Salim-Javed. The duo also gave us films like Don, Shakti, Shaan, Zanjeer, Seeta Aur Geeta and Deewar. The film was directed by Ramesh Sippy and had music of legendary R.D. Burman. Sholay gave us a Character called "Gabbar Singh" played by Amjad Khan, who made his debut with this film. The character of Gabbar Singh is so creative that many film makers have tried to imitate him for their films.Sholay did for Indian Cinema what Casablanca did for Hollywood. It became an instant classic and broke all the rules of film making and characterization, while preserving the values of Indian cinema.Sholay just won the Filmfare Award (2005) for being the Best Film in the last 50 years of Indian Cinema. Sadly, when Sholay was first released in 1975 it didn't win any major Filmfare awards. But when you think about all the great films that were released in that year, its easy to see how it may have been over looked. 1975 may have been the best year for Hindi films with the likes of Deewar, Chupke Chupke, Hera Pheri, Khel Khel Mein, Julie, Mausam, Ponga Pandit, Rafoo Chakkar, Uljhan, Dharmatma, Do Jasoos, Faraar, Geet Gaata Chal, Chhoti Si Baat, Aandhi and Milli - all releasing along with Sholay.Sholay had the biggest star cast of its time with the likes of Dharmendra, Hema Malini, Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bhaduri, Sanjeev Kumar, Sachin, A.K. Hangal, Leela Mishra, Satyen Kappu, Mac Mohan, Jagdeep, Asrani, Helen, Jalal Agha, Iftekhar, Keshto Mukherjee and of course Amjad Khan. The Greatest Cast Ever Assembled for the Greatest Story Ever Told!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am shocked seeing that the IMDb ratings for this classic is just 6.6. Why? Because the movie is strongly influenced from the Westerns? or It it isn't entertaining enough?The 2nd cant be true because the movie had everything: strong script strong direction excellent characters and performances good action,comedy,romance,friendship,etcIf the 1st is true then i feel sorry for the viewers because being influenced is not being copied.Besides there would remain only like 50-60 original scripts if counted correctly.I cannot find a single flaw in the movie which is my personal thinking and as it would be of true Hindi cinema fans.So people please judge the movie on its merits and not on something which is totally baseless.RATING:- *****/*****</fullReview>

His portrayal of a criminal with morals is all the way tops along with Brando's Vito Corleone. I think the part about cheating with false coin to save Viru's life (sacrificing his own) was a lovely storyteller's touch. 10 all the way!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the greatest Indian movie ever made. Each dialogue, each scene, each song, each character is immortal. I have seen this movie at least 10 times and it does not fail to evoke deep emotions every time. From the very first train sequence, Gabbar Singh's entry, a father's plight after discovering his son's dead body and the final clash between good and evil, this movie is masterful story telling. Although Zanjeer created the angry young man image for Amitabh, this movie surely set him on the path to super stardom. This movie was so good that even Ramesh Sippy, the direcor, has since not been able to create a movie to match this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thakur Baldev Singh (Sanjeev Kumar), once a senior police officer, hires two small-time crooks, Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jaidev (Amitabh Bachchan) to bring the dreaded dacoit Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) to him alive. Gabbar had been caught by the Thakur and sent to jail. He escaped soon after and had gunned down the Thakur's entire family barring the youngest daughter-in-law, Radha, who was away at the temple. In a violent rage, the Thakur rode unarmed to the ravines where Gabbar Singh reigned to confront him. Thinking humiliation a better revenge than death, the bandit hacked off the Thakur's arms. In the village, Veeru falls in love with the garrulous but winsome Basanti (Hema Malini), while the more serious Jaidev feels drawn to Radha. When Veeru goes late to a tryst with Basanti, he discovers she has been kidnapped by Gabbar's men. Walking into a trap, he is saved by Jaidev, who gives him cover to get Basanti away. Fatally wounded, Jaidev pretends he is mildly hurt, and sends Veeru away with Basanti. He manages to blow up a bridge and kill most of the bandits before he dies. Veeru comes back and corners Gabbar in the ravines, and is about to kill him when the Thakur arrives on the scene. He insists on fighting Gabbar alone, and hits out at Gabbar with his hobnailed shoes. Gabbar's life is saved only when the police arrive and remind the Thakur that he cannot take the law in his own hands. Veeru decides to leave Ramgarh, but in the empty compartment of the train he finds Basanti waiting for him.The Film Sholay became a legend, and by far the most successful film of its time, which ran for five consecutive years in a theater in Bombay. Often described as India's best known "curry" western, Sholay was 'patterned' on American spaghetti westerns but the addition of romance, comedy, and songs gave it the ambiance that one expects of a Hindi film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie well made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie needs no introduction. This stands as the largest all-time grosser of Bollywood. Considering the fact that in that same year 1975 , there were several other movies that became hits later on and this movie faced a lot of competition from these movies. This is a 'multi-starrer', a trend in those days.Many dialogs in this movie became very popular in every home in India and this movie itself became a household word. Every major star in this movie has done an excellent job. The direction is very good , the photography flawless. The background music score is very apt, though it resembles the spaghetti western score.But in my opinion this movie only deserves 7 stars for the mere fact that this movie is a plagiarized though Indianized version of The Kurosawa's Japanese classic " The Seven Samurai". The above is a well known fact but what is little known is the trivia that this movie also borrowed a lot of its powerful ingredients from the Gary Cooper's classic "High Noon". Another tit bit is that the movie "Mera Gaon Mera Desh" that was released a few years before was another inspiration for this movie Sholay. Though the movie "Mera Gaon Mera Desh" has taken after "High Noon" to a greater degree. Also, many scenes in this movie are influenced by the spaghetti western style of movie making.But all said and done a great movie and as they say it in Hindi "Paisa Vasool".. certainly worth watching at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the truly great films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have yet to come across anyone who has disliked this film; even people I know who dislike Indian films admit that Sholay is a truly great film. The reason is quite simple....the genres covered are universal, and the acting and direction is quite phenomenal. The characters are so brilliantly portrayed that one can sense their emotions within oneself. It has long been argued about who is the best actor in the film. Well for me, it is impossible to tell. Amjad Khan plays Gabbar Singh magnificently, but then again you have Amitabh as Jai, Dharmendra as Veeru, Hema Malini as Basanti and Sanjeev Kumar as Thakur Baldev Singh, all of who put in immaculate performances. How can one choose between them? To 'put the icing on the cake', Sholay also contains two of the greatest songs in Bollywood history(yeh dostee and jub koyee haseena root jaatee hai). When I first watched this film as a child, I was almost crying at the end. Even now when I watch it I find myself getting emotional. Yet there are parts in this film that make you laugh hysterically. So no matter what kind of films you like, this is definitely one to watch....it really is one of the truly great films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing that strikes most about this movie is the characterization. Millions of people still remember the characters in this movie. The plot is inspired from "Seven Samurai" but it is adapted well to the Indian backdrop. This movie was made at a time when bandits were not an extinct species. The plot is simple, Thakur (Sanjeev Kumar) is a cop who arrests a notorious bandit Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) only to gain his wrath. The bandit escapes and massacres Thakur's family and severs both his arms. Thakur hires two men, Veeru and Jay (played by Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan) to capture Gabbar.All the characters of this movie have left a mark on Indian cinema for a long time and will continue to remain so. Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra, Sanjeev Kumar, Jaya Bachchan and Hema Malini are all brilliant in the movie. But one man steals the show as the villain who is cunning, merciless and evil. Gabbar Singh's character was played by Amjad Khan and he is fantastic in the film. It is because of him that the movie became the greatest Indian film ever !! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best 10 MoviesPather Panchali, Bandini, Saaransh, Shole, Shakti, Anand, Awaara, Satya, Golmaal, Hera-Pheri.and 11th Shwas (Marathi Movie!)Basically, whether a person likes a movie or not is subjective. Still, there are certain guidelines to rate a movie. The subject of the movie (Pather Panchali, Bandini, Saaransh), the way it is presented (Awaara), production quality (that is why I discarded Andaaz apana apana), camera angles (Shole is best in this section but satya, aawaara are great too!), the dramatization of the subject (Shakti, Anand) are some of the elements that makes a movie great. Comedy is one of the hardest skill to acquire and perform. That is why I included Golmaal and Hera-Pheri. The seemingly easy subject are presented in such a hilarious ways that these movies definitely deserve accolades. Shwas is my personal favourite. It is a Marathi movie. And the story is about a grandfather and his 6 years old grandson, who is about to loose his eyesight due to rare cancer.</fullReview>

The cult status which has been attained by this movie is likely to make life difficult for someone who wishes to make a remake of this movie. comparisons are going to be very strong and purists would deal with a substandard replication very severely.

		<shortDescription>A Superhit Indian Western !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Undoubtedly, this mega movie is a milestone in the Bollywood filmography. The film has good characterization of vengeful roles, brilliant portrayal of tragic and terrifying sequences, as well captivating cinematography reminiscent of Hollywood western movies.This was the Indian motion picture which set the stage for a different type of movies, that is to say, action movies with vital ingredients of violence, not yet crafted by Indian producers/directors and unknown among the local audience.The full and befitting advantage of this sort/dimension of Indian cinema went to Amitabh Bachan (the Fighter/Angry Hero)and the inevitable looser was the then Super Star - romantic Rajesh Khanna who was very much unable to fit into or appropriately perform angry, violent and action studded sequences that happened to be the cry of those days.All said, the Indian Cinema moved from moral based drama to western styled Hollywood movies that was not the quintessential forte of Indian polity. You can say that the cinematic imagination transformed from the sublime to the crazy and temporal.Sholay is a very interesting movie directed by the same man who had just a couple of years ago directed Andaz - a very different family movie based on real-to-life social drama. All credits to Ramesh Sippy -the Trendsetter.</fullReview>

Regarding the plot - its novelty, people may argue that its a mixture of many Hollywood movies (of 'western' genre). I have seen most of those movies which are claimed to be the 'archetype' of this classic. It surely carries the hints of them but you should know that - "to steal ideas from one source is 'plagiarism' but to steal from multiple sources is what is known as 'research' (no offense to researchers !)".

		<fullReview>I wish I could give 11 out of 10 to this movie. First of all let me tell you that I read the negative reviews for this movie too, and almost all of the negative reviews are from people who do not understand the Indian culture or Hindi Cinema.If you are comparing this movie to westerns, you are not doing justice to this movie or to the westerns or to yourself since you will not enjoy the the comparison.This movie has the most outstanding actors, singers, music directors, movie director, script writers, dialogues, characters and screenplay all packed in one movie. This may not happen ever again.Every single dialogue written and delivered has become a part of Indian culture, referenced millions of times over and over again. Even today in 2012, people reference each other with the names of characters (Gabbar, Thakur, Basanti, Jay, Veeru, Sambha) in certain situations or sometimes even without any reference. That is the kind of impact this movie has left on the entire nation. Amitabh's baritone voice and acting, Sanjeev Kumar's dialogue and expressions, Hema Malini's constant nonsense talk, Jaya Bachchan's silence, Dharmendra's flamboyance, Last but not the least Amjad Khan's evil laugh and evil expressions these are all unparalleled portions of the movie. Sanjeev Kumar and Amjad Khan were as if born for the roles of Thakur and Gabbar.R.D. Burman, the unmatched genius in music composition has given some superhit songs (Mehbooba, Yeh Dosti, Jab tak hai jaan). His voice in Mehbooba song is icing on the cake. Singers like Kishor Kumar and Manna Day provide the perfect voice to the beautifully written and composed song "Yeh Dosti". The song sets the tone for Jay's(Amitabh) and Veeru's (Dharmendra) friendship, and the intensity remains throughout the movie even after Jay dies.The love story of the serious Jay and silent Radha is as intense as the love story of flamboyant Veeru and the chatterbox Basanti. Jay's (Amitabh) dialogues with Basanti(Hema) provide moments of laughter, although none of the characters are laughing.Every single word, every single expression, every single music note, every single moment of silence in the movie has its place. None are wasted or seem out of place. Even the supporting characters like Soorma Bhopali, Jailer, Sambha, Imaam Sahaab, Kalia have all become famous characters and it is impossible to imagine the movie without these supporting characters. I could go on and on about this move for more than 3 hours, but I don't have enough words for this movie.I have watched it more than 100 times over the years. But you should watch it at least once. If you do not like this movie, then it would only be because of one of these reasons: 1) You don't understand Indian culture and/or Hindi language 2) You are comparing the movie with a western classic or 3) You need to get a life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SHOLAY The World's best Movie Ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sholay is the ultimate movie, it has all emotions, action, comedy &amp; romance. This is the only movie in which none of the big stars outshine the other, Sanjeev, Dharam, Amitabh, Hema, Jaya &amp; Amjad. All excelled in their roles. People call it a western remake but the original had almost no emotions, no comedy, just a bland movie. Sholay cannot be compared to low films like DDLJ which had nothing properly made, there are 100s of Hindi movies which outclass DDLJ in every era. Sholay's dialogues are still being told by the masses, it is the ultimate cult movie. The only black spot in the movie is Asrani's (otherwise my favourite comedian) he plays a British period jailer, his comedy looks sick. Jagdeep was well limited with a small role otherwise he would have destroyed all the good work, I wonder when he acted well in which movie? Amitabh's timely comments &amp; his conversation with Hema's mausi was superb. Amitabh fills the comedian's role superbly. A must watch for all movie goers from all over the world, this proves the old Hindi movies were 1000s of times better than all the new age khans combined movies. P.S. Do not ever remake this Diamond Movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Biggest thing of Bollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lets accept the fact, even some great movies have their own flaws but that does not means that they are not great films. Sholay is the most profitable and biggest hit in Indian Cinema. It wont be an understatement if I say that Indian Cinema can be divided into time before Sholay and time after Sholay. Indian movies are basically protagonist based and rest of the characters are build around it but Sholay was different. Every character in the movie had its own life and its own fun. You come out of the hall even praising the antagonist or a very minor character like Surma bhopali whose screen presence was not more than 3 minutes. The film is a mass entertainer with all the elements of screen writing that are required in a hit film in abundance. Legends like Sanjeev Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra, Hema Malini, Amjad Khan(who was not a star then) and other actors like A.K.Hangal, Jagdeep, Asrani, Keshto Mukherji left their marks on whatever role was given to them. Some say that the story is been lifted from Seven Samurai's and Magnificent seven but it doesn't matter because when you will watch the movie you will find the treatment to be totally Indian as only the basic plot is taken from those movies which for me is not a crime. Coming this movie from master writer duo of Salim-Javed and hands of Director Ramesh Sippy, you just can't afford to miss this entertainer. Watch this because in India if you don't know Amitabh Bachchan or have watched Sholay then you have no right to call yourself Indian or visit India or talk about India. Watch Sholay and get the license.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some major Goofs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest movies ever made, no doubt. I have seen this movies some umpteen times in my life, was just 14 when I saw this movie in 1975. Downloaded a DVD (XVID) version from internet (Director's Cut Version) 205 Min's. One of the major goofs I noted is (which is also there in the actual theater release). Now for the GOOF?Jai and Veeru are fighting the last encounter with the bandits. Jai is left alone to fight the bandits and he is using both the hands for holding the guns and pistols, keeps firing from them regularly. Later Veeru returns and holds Jai in his arms, during that period you can see Jai's both palms in open position, there are many shots and for many minutes that shows his open palm, but at the end Veeru is seen picking up the "Magic" coin from one of Jai's closed fist. Can a dead man take out a coin from his pocket and hold it, nor can a person use guns holding a coin in his palms ? When Basanthi is being chased by bandits, while crossing the wooden bridge she does a small stunt, she moves the horse cart and breaks down the bridge and moves ahead, so the bandits are forced to take a detour to catch her. Veeru follows them and also find the bridge broken and takes a detour. Both Basanti and Veeru are caught by the bandits and Jai rescues them later. While returning after being saved by Jai from Gabbar's den, Veeru, Basanti and Jai are seen crossing the same bridge which is FULLY intact. Also just before the final climax the bridge is seen FULLY intact before the bridge is blown off by the bomb thrown by a bandit. During that fight the bridge does not have any dead bandit, but when Veeru is seen riding a horse to have a dual with Gabbar, crosses the same blown off bridge you can note a dead bandit lying on the bridge. (TWO MAJOR GOOFS in an important climax of a great movie)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched this one many times during 1975 to 1980. In the 90s watched it on VCR and now on DVD. Nothing matched the experience of watching on mint condition 70 mm print with 6 track stereo sound among 1200 fans in theater on the first day ( It came late to Madras on Dec 5th 1975). Only time I felt that it is not all original was when I watched the train scene of the English western and learnt the thrilling scenes and angles were carbon copy. Still for a Hindi movie at that time it was breath taking.After this many years I still enjoy ( remember the lines of this movie despite the fact that I don't speak Hindi ) . In fact my entire vocobulary of Hindi will have 80% for words spoken in this movie. For a 3hr 15 mins movie, not much was spoken.The alternate ending being shown now does not really matter anymore. It would have been a hit whichever way it ended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thakur Baldev Singh (Sanjeev Kumar), once a senior police officer, hires two small-time crooks, Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jaidev (Amitabh Bachchan) to bring the dreaded dacoit Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) to him alive. How Jai and Veeru plan to capture Gabbar Singh and bring him to Thakur forms the rest of the movie. In the village, Veeru falls in love with the garrulous but winsome Basanti (Hema Malini), while the more serious Jaidev feels drawn to Radha.Sholay had all the elements of a Western - rugged countryside (the film was shot in the rocky landscape of Ramnagaram a small village about 30 miles from Bangalore), bandits on horseback, fierce gun fights etc. Sholay's phenomenal success can be attributed to perhaps the way it was able to blend the various items or 'masalas' required in a Hindi film in exactly the right doses. Practically every scene, dialogue and even a small character was a highlight. Even Dhanno, the horse of the tangewali, Hema Malini is remembered till today! Every small character be it the Jailer (Asrani), Mausi (Leela Mishra) or Sambha (Mac Mohan) - they are etched in viewer's minds.In India, Sholay is not just a movie... it is a legend. There are people in India who remember each and every character of the movie vividly even now - 31 years after it was first released !!! this is the beauty of the film. Every character is so well sketched. It is the highest grossing film of all time in India. It has earned about Rs. 2,134,500,000, equivalent to US $ 50 million, after adjusting for inflation. It ran for 286 weeks straight in one Mumbai theatre, the Minerva. Using sentences like "Arre O Samba", "Ab Tera Kya Hoga Kaaliya?" mothers frightened their children with the name of Gabbar Singh. Sholay was loud, garish, but it had something which touched everyone's heart. Shot in 70mm with stereophonic sound, Sholay was the ultimate big screen experience. It was India's first film in 70 mm with stereophonic sound. Mention must be made of Dwarka Diwecha's stunning camera-work and R.D. Burman's evocative background score, which help elevate the film even further.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Indian filmmaker G.P. Sippy died last December at the age of 93. his son Ramesh directed this film, which remains the most famous Hindi-language movie and the biggest commercial success for Bollywood. If you want to watch one Bollywood film in his honor, this is it.This epic has everything. It has a magnificent Seven type story, but there are only two who come to save the village. They are thieves hired by a former policeman to capture the bandit leader.It is a spaghetti-western of sorts as there are plenty of horses, and shooting, and fights.It is a lavish musical with amazing color and costumes as the villagers really put on a show for their simple festival of colors.It has comedy, slapstick, romance (but NO kissing!), music, a little horror, almost continuous action, tragedy, and triumph. Like, I said, if you only see one Sippy production, this should be it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Indian Blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SOME SPOILERS***** Sholay, directed by Ramesh Sippy in 1975, remains the most successful Hindi (perhaps Indian) film ever made. While a couple of films have made more money and recently Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge surpassed Sholay's unprecedented 5 year run at Minerva Theatre in Bombay, Sholay leads by dint of the sheer impact it made on not just Indian cinema, but popular culture in general. The film is a loose adaptation of the Magnificent Seven (itself based on Kurosawa's Seven Samurai) and borrows freely from other movies - Hollywood or Indian. However, its adaptation is uniquely Indian and it remains, to my mind, immeasurably superior to the movies it is based upon. The story is about two crooks, Jai and Veeru, in rural central India - a region ravaged by dacoits (outlaws) - who are hired by a village landlord, Thakur to catch Gabbar Singh- a notorious outlaw - alive. Jai is the quiet reflective crook, while Veeru is loud, boisterous, impetuous, and a lothario to boot. Veeru falls in love with Basanti - a garrulous taangewali (horsecart driver) while Jai silently wooes the Thakur's widowed daughter-in-law, Radha. ******SPOILER ALERT*****SKIP THIS SECTION IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIEIt appears that Gabbar had been arrested by the Thakur while the latter was a police inspector and had exacted revenge upon escaping jail by massacring the Thakur's family. The Thakur's attempt at evening scores was met by capture and by the chopping off of his arms in a chilling scene. Hence, the need for mercenaries.****SPOILER OVER****Getting the bandit and the eventual shootout is the climax of the film, but it is greater than the sum of its parts. Each character, including minor ones like the jailer, the braggart lumber merchant (Surma Bhopali), the Maulvi, the family servant, have been well fleshed out and have significant parts - at the very least they entertain. The script tends to meander, but Sholay was not meant to be a simple revenge film - it conveyed a larger picture of villages, the dacoit menace so real then and even now.The film was shot in South India at Ramnagram rather than at the place where it was set (central India) but the stark, rugged scenery was worth it. As the first 70mm film in India and the first to use stereophonic sound, Sholay secured a place in Indian film history.Its success derives from a good script which does not allow for a dull moment (full marks to Salim-Javed for doing this), excellent direction and editing and excellent cinematography.While the film was fairly violent it was characteristic of its period. Its legacy however, is the dialogues of the major characters which the producers were able to sell as a separate LP record in 1975 - a first in Indian cinema. A generation later, most Indians who know Hindi understand "Kitne Aadmi the?" "Loha Lohe ko Kat taa hai" "Tera Kyaa Hoga Kaalia" - so much so that these dialogues have entered the lexicon and are frequently used in commercials.RD Burman's music was a big plus with a fantastic score and even better background music. Indeed the background music from the faux "Western" theme music to music that announced major characters like Gabbar Singh is recognized even after three decades.Sholay made the career of Gabbar Singh as the first psychopath on the big screen ( though some might argue that Danny Denzongpa had essayed that in Dhund) in India, though he could never get a comparable role later. Sanjeev Kumar's controlled rage as the Thakur was a close second performance. Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan were very good with both exhibiting comedy especially in the water tank scene, though Hema Malini was a bit over the top. The supporting cast of Asrani (jailor), Surma Bhopali (Lumber merchant) and others were very good.A must see that seems to transcend time. I am obviously biased but years of screening this film for international as well as Indian audiences have convinced me of its worldwide appeal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TIt is a landmark film being the first ever 7o m.m film.made in India.Adapting a Western film theme to Indian Conditions is a remarkable achievement and the gun -weilding action scenes remind One of the Sergi Leone Spaghetti Westerns like 'A Few Dollars More".The Cinematography is classical.What demarcates this film from an average one is the classical direction. The way scenes showing the Thakur's arms being amputated by Gabbar,the Thakur's grandson being shot by Gabbar and Ahmed ,the village boy being tortured to death are effectively cut reveal this aspect.The way Gabbbar Singh is introduced is classical where he is shown walking on the rocks revealing only his legs .However there are contradictory aspects in the film's script like a Thakur defending the lives of the village peasants(Traditionally Thakurs were landlords who terrorised the peasants)and 2 urban based gangsters wishing to settle down in a village.Sholay falls marginally short of a classic like Mughal -E-Azam.It does not relate to Social reality as films like "Mother India'or Do Bhiga Zameen' nor has the philosophical depth of films like 'Pyaasa' or 'Mera Naam Joker'.That does not deny that it is the best film of it's type ever made in India and it's impact on the Indian psyche has been unparalleled in the history of Indian Cinema.The acting of Amjad Khan and Sanjeev Kumar are displays of true genius.There is also a moral aspect to the film unlike the Italian Spaggheti westerns of the 1960's.By Harsh Thakor</fullReview>

It will be an understatement to say that sholay is a cult movie cause it is much more than that. It is a statement on the times(the '70s) and is the greatest cast ever assembled and the best technicians ever assembled. And for all the sholay connieuers the book on "making of sholay" is a must read. The director has to take the credit for backing such a monumental work and carrying it off brilliantly.

		<shortDescription>Was the success of Sholay rely on Gabbar Singh character by Amjad Khan?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lets talk about Sholay! The moment Sholay is mentioned, honestly the first thing comes into our mind is the "Gabbar Singh" with his popular dialog which is remembered until today. I would like to recommend that Sholay was a big hit just because of Gabbar Singh character. There are thousands of movie had been made and non has the Gabbar Singh villain type of quality in it. Fair enough, each character was good in the movie, but i will still stand for the Gabbar character which was wonderfully acted by late Amjad Khan. If the character were to act by some other famous villain of that time, its possible that the film have will some credits definitely, but not as what it achieved by taking Amjad Khan.Secondly, the character of Thakur Baldev Singh was the second reason's of the success. The other characters of the film has also contributed to the success of the film. The pair of Jay and Veeru was truly spirits of DOSTI. Basanti was just marvelous. Jaya was good and also Satyen Kapuu. Asrani and Jagdeep was real humorous.Their jokes are remembered until today. The Imaam Saab and the Azan scenes, touches millions hearts.The ever fear introduction of Gabbar Singh with the thrilling back ground music are the best entry of a villain ever seen of any Hindi movie.The song Yeh Dosti, Ha Jab Tak Hai Jaan and Mehbooba Mehbooba are the most popular song of the movie. RD.Burman gives great music to the film. Kader Khan - best dialog, Salim Javed - best story and script, Veeru Dev Gun - best action, Ramesh Sippy - Best Direction and all those who was involved in the film has done a very good job ever.Sad that the film was not awarded even millions have watched the film over and over again. It was blockbuster during it time and well remain ever-green movie!Finally, a complete, good and best film ever made and its impossible that there will be any other film which will be able to over take G.P Sippy SHOLAY from the main chart. Never!A film that should not been miss and worth watching. "Aur Film Kab Hain? Kab Hain?................. Syaabas!!!"</fullReview>

Two, the invigorating and revitalizing drama writers: Salim-Javed that leaves you awestruck, even though you may have lost count of the number of times you've watched this incredible entertainer. With 3D, every pivotal character stands out quite literally in the film. On the whole, there are films and there is SHOLAY. Frankly, it would be sacrilegious to miss this classic. Watch it. Now.The 3D conversion could've been more polished for a film of this stature. Still, the effect is spellbinding. The train sequence still the best train sequence ever shot in Hindi cinema is the highlight ? new effects have been added to enhance the 3D element. With a length of over 3 hours, the 3D gets tiresome in parts but the sheer grandeur of the film keeps you going. India's epic adventure is back ? rush to the screens now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of the most pathetic conversion from 2D-3D available on screen, that puts the shoddy 'Clash of the Titans' on a pedestal for how to do things. The wonderful original background score has also been screwed-with (thankfully, not to a great extent) by someone called Raju Singh. Atmos sound works most of the time. Better viewed in 2D, and I shall remedy the mistake when/if I get the chance, though I'd have to live with the screwed-over score in any case (I think).Having said that, the audience members who watched this one when I did, had the following attributes: 1. Intent in capturing selfies during the movie's running time. Cams pointed right at the audience as well, flashes going off to the tune of 5-10 occasions every half hour. 2. Babies, who (obviously) brought the house down with the (oh so pleasant) screaming when Atmos accentuated every gunshot, every death-scream, and every swear word. 3. Cam phones once again, being used by geniuses to take snaps of the (3D) images on screen. Wait, there's more... 4. Cacophonous laughs and jeers at every quite moment, some of which were romantic, most of which were tragic/poignant. Same batch of geniuses (see above) joining in, with quite a few followers to boot......Now, in spite of not blowing a blood vessel at all that (quite used to putting up with, nee living with, said geniuses that populate most cinemas, including multiplexes), I confess to having not felt bored even during (what I consider the weakest element of this masterpiece) those interminable flashbacks, and dated-looking/sounding/seeming scenarios on display. The performances are still top-notch, the music plays a huge role (the not-too-destroyed RDB-original score during the train sequence being a case-in-point - the rest having been butchered by Raju Singh). All-in-all, I do hope someone coverts this for IMAX (hopefully, without the 3D), or someone updates the 3D sometime, even with crowd-funding, if that's an option. Still, this compares well against most of the other trash playing, and being appreciated, out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An all time best movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie myself many times and I loved it. The main reason why this movie is considered the one of the best in Bollywood is the time in which it was made. It was made during the 70's where blockbuster movies were in much much more demand than critically acclaimed ones. This movie combined the effects of both. It has an engaging and nice plot with a bit of suspense , romance , comedy , plenty of action , brilliant music , superb acting and some moral lessons(SOME). It's excellent dialogues have become very popular in India where the majority of the population is aware of them and you can say that an Indian movie goer comes to age by watching this movie [ and a few others such as Mother India , 3 idiots , etc]. This is a must watch movie in my opinion. People of today may not like it so much but if you some other movies of the 70's , go back a little in time to the India in the 70's and perhaps you will simply fall in love with the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The" perfect movie of bollywood that contains everything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now what can I say about this one?This is the best movie bollywood could ever produce;everything is just perfect about this film--it contains action,romance,suspense,comedy,great acting,beautiful songs,unforgettable characters and dialogues and what not!Even after so many years,it's craze remains the same.One surprising thing is that when the film was released,it was considered to be just another average film,it also didn't received many awards or nominations..just when the theaters were going to stop showing it,people were seen in great queues outside the cinema-halls!Suddenly there were rush towards the theaters,and it unexpectedly became so big a hit that it became the first ever bollywood film to observe a silver jubilee!I recommend this film very very much;thogh would also like to mention that people not connected to Indian culture,or people who doesn't know much of it,might find it not so magical..I see some people are considering the comic scenes total nonsense,but without them(surma bhopali and jailer scenes) the movie seems incomplete to me.Here at IMDb,people who hate this film says all the songs but "mehbooba mehbooba" are bogus!I strongly disagree to that and think they only tell so because songs other than "mehbooba mehbooba" have Indian tunes in them.Just see this film and you will be wondered to discover no matter how many times you watch this;watching it over and over again will never tire you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just before watching the movie I would have never imagined I was about to watch such an amazing movie. One of the best movies Bollywood has produced. I have watched it 5 times and it never seems to get old. Amjad Khans acting as Gabbar is amazing. The dialogue are strong and really make the movie even more interesting and fun to watch.The scene setting is amazing too. The scene where Gabbar kills Kalia and other people in the gang after they came back from a unsuccessful fight, is just amazing. The sound of Guns, horses and winds really spice the movie even more. Who ever haven't watched this movie, should watch this movie as soon as possible and perhaps watch it again a couple of time. Overall, its a masterpiece with great acting by every member of the cast and a great storyline!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A legend that lives on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rated by BBC as the Film of the Millennium in1999, Sholay, the greatest Indian movie ever made has nothing in common with Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather, the greatest American movie ever made. Despite their obvious differences, both the movies have withstood the test of time and have not only won the hearts of film lovers all over the world but have been instrumental in shaping pop culture. Compared to Godfather, Sholay might come across as campy. However, the naysayers may not realize that what Godfather did to the gangster genre, Sholay did to the entire film industry of India.With Sholay, Ramesh Sippy was determined to break most of the rules of Hindi film making and set higher standards. It wasn't just the way the script was structured and filmed but he made the entire production run on a timetable and strict discipline was the order of the day; not even the actors were spared. This was unheard of in the world of mainstream film-making in India in those days, including the idea of showing realism on screen. The film clearly draws its inspiration from Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns and Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai and just like this one has its heart in its place.A retired, but not out of element, police officer Thakur (Sanjeev Kumar) hiring two goons Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jai (Amitabh Bachchan) to get rid of bandits from his native village is the central theme of the story. The two protagonists pack enough bravura, bravery and shooting skills, but are basically flawed and are serving their own interests in helping the hapless villagers. In this context the Thakur's choice of the goons over the police to defend the village seems illogical but having fought the bandits together when law failed to deliver then and later, he merely goes with the lesser evil. And once the goods are delivered after much loss of life, the victorious leaves the village, never to return again. The rich tapestry of memorable characters which inhabit this story of good vs. evil have over the years become so iconic that even the minor characters have attained mythological status namely on the strength of their spoken dialog.The film's action, the kind of which never witnessed on Indian screens before, keeps viewers transfixed; gun battle scenes, especially the train robbery scene which sets the tone of the film in the beginning, are raw and violent; and above all it gave the world a new avatar of evil- Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) as the lead villain. Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra and Sanjeev Kumar give strong performances overall. Jaya Bhaduri, who plays Thakur's widowed daughter-in-law, delivers the most tragic performance of all. Music by R.D. Burman is energetic but collectively only serviceable and is mostly remembered for the song Mehbooba Mehbooba.Sholay was the most violent movie of its time and it is said that in 1975 the first crop of audiences that came out after watching it was left so numb that the word of mouth publicity did nothing for it to succeed. Sholay was their most visceral experience to date and slowly as its popularity grew it lasted for more than five years in theaters. Much like Godfather, Sholay is an experience and if you have not seen either of them your film journey is incomplete.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is why I love Indian movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They even do spaghetti westerns better than we do!!!Despite a couple of sloppy visual mistakes (you can see the coupling towing a motorcycle and towards the end an assistant peeks his head up behind a bush behind a very pivotal scene), this is an excellent movie.The acting is fabulous. The plot line engaging. The horse chases are amazing. There is a horse chase with a train, horse chasing carriages, bridges being destroyed. A guy taking a horse down with his bare hands! It is filmed in a location with large rock formations - like the Vasquez rocks where so many US westerns were filmed so that the shootouts have that same western feel. It even has an Ennio Morricone style soundtrack! But I don't ever remember being this emotionally engaged - on the edge of my seat biting my fingernails with tension engaged - watching a Sergio Leone movie. And I love Sergio Leone. The bad guy is crazy bad. The good guy is crazy too - his final scene where he fights the bad guy unarmed - you would NEVER see that in a US movie. The story is heartbreaking at the end - I cried. Not as much as I do when reading a Zane Grey novel - but still - it's pretty heartbreaking and so well acted!!! My one request is for someone good, like Vinod Chopra, to remake this movie starring Abhishek and Faran Akhtar. And I know this movie is so good no one wants to remake it, but ... the remake of Don with SRK is excellent and even better than the original. And I hear the remake of Agneepath is excellent too. With the right director and cast - yeah - I totally want to see what Abhishek does with the role!! And Faran - yeah- him too! What would make my fantasy remake of this movie complete? Amitabh in the role of Thukar. This movie is a perfect example of why I've pretty much stopped watching western movies. Indian movies are better. Even their westerns are better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true Indian classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sholay is arguably one of the most complete movie ever made in India, during its release it was panned by critics and everyone expected it to flop but word of mouth reviews made it into one of the biggest success in Indian history it ran for 286 weeks in one theater in Mumbai also it ran for 50 weeks in 50 cities in India, In the 80s and 90s its claimed that there is not a single Indian who has not watched this movie, I have watched it at least twenty times, many people know almost all the dialogues in the movie by heart Dharmendra and Amitabh Bacchan play convicts with a heart of gold who are recruited by Sanjeev Kumar who lost his entire family to capture dreaded bandit "Gabbar Singh" played by Amjad Khan alive, they are supported ably by Jaya Bhaduri and Hema Malini as female leads, I feel that you cannot review a film like Sholay, you have to watch it to know it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ramesh Sippy's 'Sholay' is Amongst The Great Cinematic Moments in The History of Film. An Outstanding Motion-Picture, that oozes perfection &amp; flamboyance. A True Masterpiece, that re-defined Hindi Cinema!'Sholay' Synopsis: After his family is murdered by a notorious and ruthless bandit, a former police officer enlists the services of two outlaws to capture him.'Sholay' is an Outstanding Motion-Picture. I've seen this Masterstroke a number of times &amp; I can't get enough of it. Salim-Javed's Screenplay is a Milestone. The Script is Super-Strong, The Characters are Mesmerizing &amp; The Narrative is Magnificent. The film runs for a 190-Minutes, but not a single moment does the momentum come down. In fact, the film gets bigger &amp; grander with each passing scene. Ramesh Sippy's Direction is Fantastic. He executes this unforgettable story, with magnetic ease. Cinematography is fabulous. Editing is razor-sharp. Music by R. D. Burman, is legendary. Performance-Wise: Amjad Khan as Gabbar Singh, delivers an astonishing performance. He makes Gabbar, the most despicable villain you'd ever see on the big screen. Sanjeev Kumar as Thakur, is flawless, as always. Amitabh Bachchan as Jai &amp; Dharmendra as Veeru, are heroic &amp; extremely competent. Hema Malini as Basanti, is lovable. Jaya Bachchan as Radha, is graceful. Viju Khote as Kaalia &amp; Mac Mohan as Sambha, are excellent. Jagdeep as Soorma Bhopali &amp; Asrani as a Jailer, are hilarious. A.K. Hangal as Imam, Sachin as Ahmed &amp; Satyen Kappu as Ramlaal, are good. On the whole, 'Sholay' is a Masterpiece. Its Simply Too Damn Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It has assimilated with the Indian folklore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Indian mythological epic - Ramayan, Sage Vishwamitra asks King Dashrath for his sons - Ram and Lakshman to take on the might of the evil demons, creating havoc in the pious forests inhabited by the saints and finally the twosome kills all the evil ones, restoring peace and Dharma once again.Millenniums later, in the celluloid era, a movie was made in Japan - Seven Samurai (1954) which portrayed the story of a veteran Samurai (Japanese militaryman) taking six others with him to get the better of a dangerous bandit which is synonymous with terror in his village. This story inspired many Indian cine-script writers to make its Bollywoodish versions which came in the form of Mera Gaon Mera Desh (1971), Khote Sikkay (1974), Karma (1986), Army (1996), China Gate (1998), Keemat (1998) etc. However the most impactful of the Indianized versions of Seven Samurai is definitely - Sholay (1975) which was written by the high-profile cine-script writers, Salim-Javed. Though they had taken inspiration from Seven Samurai, yet, by default, Sholay turned out, not at all a shadow of these or any other movie on similar lines. It developed an identity of its own and became a legendary movie of the Indian cinema.Sholay (flames) is based on the theme of the revenge-seeking mission of an ex-copThakur Baldev Singh (Sanjeev Kumar) whose all family members but for himself and his young daughter-in-law, Radha (Jaya Bhaduri) have been killed by the dangerous dacoit - Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) who has deprived him of his hands too. Handicapped Thakur seeks the help of two petty thieves - Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jay (Amitabh Bachchan) who visit his village, Ramgarh only to earn money in return of helping him. However knowledge of the truth transforms their hearts and they fight tooth and nail with the bandit and his gang, Jay loses his life in this mission whereas Veeru gains the love of his life in the form of Basanti (Hema Malini).It is said that good pieces are made through hard, sincere and planned work but masterpieces are born by default. The same thing has happened to Sholay. It's a masterpiece by default and not by deliberate effort. The screenplay contains many loopholes and its definitely over-dramatic, devoid of the naturalness to a large extent. Still it keeps the viewer hooked. In fact, had the story been portrayed naturally, perhaps it would not have been able to be considered a masterpiece. The over-the-top nature of the picturization alongwith comic and witty dialogues (and their memorable delivery) is something which makes this entertaining movie nor only more entertaining but also an unforgettable experience for the viewer. This only provides unmeasurable repeat value to this movie. No surprise that several spectators have watched it dozens of times.There are two major plus points of this movie adding spice to its already high entertainment value - 1. The mannerisms of the villain, Gabbar Singh and his theatrical dialogue delivery, 2. The comedy generated by Veeru, Basanti, Jay and some insignificant characters like the Jailer of the British times (Asrani) and Soorma Bhopali (Jagdeep). The scene of Veeru climbing up the water tank in a drunken state, threatening to commit suicide and demanding the hand of Basanti in marriage, is definitely the best comedy scene of Dharmendra's career.Sholay is just like a dish in every ingredient and every required spice is just optimum, making it a highly delicious one rendering the eater a taste to remember forever. And that taste is such that it draws the eater again and again towards the dish. It's not a realistic movie about the bandits of India. It's an entertaining movie, providing wholesome entertainment through the activities of the characters who may not be found in this world. I consider Sholay as the biggest fantasy whose unique characteristic is that apparently it does not render the look of a fantasy.Director Ramesh Sippy has directed the movie well despite loopholes and inconsistencies which are overlooked by us because we are mesmerized by the entertainment we get through the narrative. Technical and production value aspects are quite high despite the fact that almost the whole story takes place in the rural setting. Music by R.D. Burman is quite OK, neither excellent, nor bad. The biggest strength of the movie is the dialogues, especially the dialogues of the villain, Gabbar Singh. These dialogues alongwith Gabbar Singh, his sidekick - Saambha (played by Mac Mohan) and a member of his gang - Kaalia (played by Viju Khote) have become so popular that now they are a part of the Indian folklore. Who can forget - 'Arre O Saambha' and 'Tera Kya Hoga Kaaliya'.The high-profile star cast of Dharmendra, Sanjeev Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, Hema Malini and Jaya Bhaduri has excelled in the roles assigned. Everybody gets full marks for the underplay (Amitabh, Jaya and Sanjeev) and overplay (Dharmendra-Hema) as required by the situation in the scene. Asrani has been given the get-up of Hitler in his completely over-the-top role of Angrezon Ke Zamaane Ka Jailer (the Jailer of the British times) but he and others like him generate laughters as demanded by their roles. Leela Mishra, A.K. Hangal, Sachin etc. also leave their mark in their cameos. And finally, it's Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) who has become immortal because of this movie. Never in the history of cinema, a villain had amassed so much popularity which overtook the popularity of the hero / heroes. Amjad Khan never got such a role in his career again and also could never come out of the hangover of this role. Gabbar Singh with his mannerisms has become a legend.Sholay is a movie in which the negatives also turned out to be the positives and everything just fell in place to render it a class of its own. It has been re-released many times and the Indian folklore has absorbed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sholay is truly the Greatest Hindi movie ever made of all times everythingwise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gabbar Singh is firmly entrenched in Indian cinema history as being a very popular villain. This is mainly due to Amjad's tour-de-force performance but also partly due to the way Ramesh Sippy introduces his character into the film. He allows suspense to build-up through several characters' hushed mentions of the notorious bandit. Gabbar does not make his screen appearance until after one song and a lot of scenes have gone past. Even then his face is not shown immediately at first. The sound of shoes clashing onto the rock signifies Gabbar's entrance. The camera shows his henchmen's terrified faces from the angle of Gabbar's shoes. This is a comment on the power that he wields over his yes-men. He is above them and can control whomever he wants. He believes that he is as powerful as God. He has a very maniacal laugh that would not sound out of place in a mental asylum.Sholay had a string of extremely fine performances by all the actors. It is very difficult to pinpoint on any one of them, saying he or she was the best. Whether it was Amitabh or Dharmendra, Hema or Jaya in her brilliantly essayed cameo, or the towering Sanjeev Kumar as the 'thakur'. They surpassed their own credentials.What can one say about this film that has not already been said by thousands of others? Yet, "Sholay" is the type of film that no matter how many times is talked about or frequently played at cinemas, movie buffs never tire of it. A sign of an evergreen classic. For everyone has their own different favorite moment or scene that they recall fondly from the movie. Be it Basanti (Hema Malini) chatting away nines to the dozen or Gabbar Singh 's(Amjad Khan) booming voice philosophizing, "Jo darr gaya samjho margaya (Who ever is scared is dead)". Or the sound of the swing squeaking after the dacoits have inflicted their reign of terror on the household of Thakur Baldev Singh (Sanjeev Kumar). Sholay is easily the greatest film ever made in the history of Indian cinema.It is a must watch movie before dying for anyone who has even the slightest interest to see masterpieces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the greatest movie ever created in bollywood cinema. It will not be replicated as the acting performances cannot be even reached by actors of today. The story will grip you throughout and the performances are utterly impeccable. In 1975, it had a greater impact than The Godfather did at its time. This movie will rock you to your core. It contains all elements that contribute to an epic masterpiece. Comedy, Action, Tragedy, Romance. All elements are evident and yet the movie does not lose its simple and yet undeniably unique touch. Again greatest movie to ever grace Indian Cinema and i say this in February of 2009. You can enjoy this regardless of race or culture. Just watch it and don't insult it with a mediocre rating. It is the equivalent of giving the Godfather a rating of 7 in an Indian movie review site.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sholay- The ultimate Bollywood movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion the best Hindi film ever made. Everything is top notch, the theme tune, songs,dialogues, the casting and so much more. This is the highest grossing action movie ever, most classics such as KKHH AND DDLJ were love stories. Sholay was inspired by the Hollywood hit The Magnificent Seven which in turn was a remake of the Kurosawa masterpiece The Seven Samurai but in my opinion Sholay is just so so much better In my opinion Sholay is a mix of genres, there is action,romance comedy etc. Another remarkable quality is the characterizations, The characters are just so well thought out. There was the vengeful Thakur (played by the superb Sanjeev Kumar), Jai and Veeru( Amitabh and Dharmendra) Basanti (Hema Malini) and last and certainly not least Amjad Khan as the tyrant Gabbar. His entry sequence is one of the best and well known in Bollywood history. Gabbar set the standard for Bollywood villains, especially in the scene when he cuts off Thakur's arms. His dialogues are often repeated especially Kitne Aadmi thee.Most people claim this is just a revenge movie but its much more than that, Sholay is also a tale of redemption. Jai and Veeru at the start are no for nothing crooks but during the movie they start to change. For instance when they first turn up at Thakur's house they plan to rob him and flee but later on during the movie they return his money and say that they will get Gabbar for nothing. They even decide to stop their evil ways and start making a living farming like the villagers.Sholay is also a tale of friendship, probably the best ever portrayed in a Bollywood movie. Two great instances is when at the end Jai spares Veeru's life by sending him back to the village and gets killed himself. Another great instance is after Jai dies Veeru goes to kill Gabbar and then lets him go after Thakur reminds him that it was Jai that had promised that Gabbar would be returned alive, after that Veeru says if it was his promise he would have broken it.Another remarkable quality of Sholay is the emotional impact. I don't normally cry whilst watching movies but Jai's death scene gets me every time. Also the scene where Ahmed gets killed by Gabbar and he is sent back to the village on a horse is just unbearable for me.All the cast play their roles to perfection but it is Sanjeev Kumar that stands out for me. For instance the last scene where he demands Gabbar to give him his hands. Amjad Khan also more than delivered. I cannot imagine any other actor playing him other than Amjad Khan.The music by the my genius R.D. Burman was superb. My favourite are yeh dosti or Mehbooba (sung by R.D. Burman himself). In my opinion this was his best score for a movie. The action scenes also deserve a special mention, the sequence in which Sanjeev Kumar, Dharmendra and Amitabh are trying to fend off bandits whilst travelling on train is one of my favourite action sequences ever.In fact until a couple of years ago I could only remember seeing the edited version (damn T.V. channels lol) and they had completely deleted all scenes of Soorma Bhoopali and Asrani. There are not many thirty year old movies that can still excite me when I watch them but Sholay is one of those movies that defies that rule. I can go on ranting about my passion for Sholay, thank you Salim Javed for providing me hours of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sholay is the name of ultimate entertainment. Even after 32 years of its release, people still flood the theater to watch the movie. One movie which has created history of sorts. Sholay is a movie of Stars. Stars like Amitabh, Dharmendra, Sanjeev Kumar, Jaya Bhaduri, Hema Malini, Amjad Khan, Javed Akhtar, Ramesh Sippy, R D Burman, Salim Khan.The movie is one among those few movies in those days which was 3 hrs and 8 minutes long. Jai (Amitabh) and Veeru (Dharam) are two small time criminals who are picked by Thakur Baldev Singh (Sanjeev Kumar) to catch a dacoit Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan). The reason, Gabbar Singh killed all the members of Thakur's family.When Thakur as a Police Officer had a clash with Gabbar and he was caught. Gabbar however, escaped from police custody and killed all the members of Thakur's family. Hence Thakur seeks help of these two guys to seek revenge from Gabbar. The action and emotion that follows constitute the story of the movie. Not a very great story compared to today but then during those time, it made history.The movie has some great musics, dialogs, story, acting from lead actors. And of course the direction as well as comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sholay" means "Flames" and this is what the Sippys were able show in this movie, which had a multi cast: Dharmendra, Amitabh Bachchan, Hema Malini, Jaya Bachchan, Amjad Khan as "Gabbar Singh" and Sanjeev Kumar. The other members of the cast include: Asrani, Jagdeep and the late Keshto Mukerjee.A Thakur, a former Police officer, hires two small time criminals, whom he had captured once, Jai and Veeru, to capture the most wanted bandit, Gabbar Singh, who had killed almost all members of his family and left him with a widowed daughter - in - law. The bandit and his men are also terrorising the villagers. Jai and Veeru except the deal offered to them that they must capture Gabbar Singh alive. But all the time, they try and make arrangements to loot the Thakur's "safe" and run away with the money until the daughter - in - law catches them trying to open the safe.However, after an encounter with Gabbar and his men, Jai and Veeru inform Thakur that they are no longer interested in capturing Gabbar Singh, as they could no longer do the job for a men who is not prepared to grab hold of a weapon to try and help them. It is then that they realise that Thakur's hands were cut off by Gabbar after he killed the family members.This has some of the most memorable dialogues: Gabbar to one of his men,"Abh Tera Kya Hoga Kaliya?" There were only two of them and three of you!But you still came back, thinking that, I, your leader will congratulate you and be happy!"Veeru to Gabbar Singh: "Gabbar Singh! I am coming." Thakur to Gabbar Singh during the final encounter: "My legs are more than enough for you!" "Give me those hands Gabbar." The songs, the story, the acting and not to mention the script by Salim - Javed is brilliant as are the songs and especially "Mehbooba Mehbooba," sung by the late R.D. Burman.A good family entertainment.In the re - make of this classic 1975 hit, Amitabh Bachchan is to play the role of a modern day Gabbar Singh, while his son, Abhishek is no longer playing the part of Jai but is playing the part of Jalal Agha, singing "Mehbooba Mehbooba" with Urmila Matondkar is to perform the dance sequence, while Amitabh sits and watches.Ajay Devgan the role of Veeru. The part of Basanti is being played by Nisha Kothari and Sushmita Sen, the part of Radha - the widowed daughter - in - law. The exception here is that the name "Radha" will not be used, instead she will be known as "Devi" who will not be the daughter - in - law, but instead she will be the former inspector's brother's widow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Eastern Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the small Indian village of Ramgarh, a former policeman and wealthy landowner named Thakur Baldev Singh approaches Veeru and Jai, two petty criminals whom he has formerly arrested in the line of duty. He offers the two men 20,000 rupees, plus an official reward of 50,000 rupees, if they will track down and capture alive an infamous bandit named Gabbar Singh, against whom the Thakur (an Indian title roughly equivalent to "Lord") has a particular reason for desiring revenge. The reason why the Thakur is so anxious for revenge on Gabbar will become clear later in the story. This plot line clearly shows the influence of the conventions of the Western. Yet in many other ways "Sholay" is a very different film from anything likely to be produced by the American (or for that matter the European) cinema. At over three hours in length, for example, it is much longer than the standard "revenge Western". It is an example of what have become known in India as "Masala films" because they consist of a mixture of different elements- drama, comedy, romance, music- in the same way as the curry dish masala consists of a mixture of different spices. Judged by Western criteria, "Sholay" would seem like a very poor piece of film-making indeed. Not only is it insanely overlong, the various elements which make up the plot do not seem to gel together at all well. The main story is a dark, brooding tale of sadism, bloodshed and revenge, which recalls not only the conventions of the Western but also those of Elizabethan and Jacobean drama. Yet this bloody tale is often interrupted by cheerful musical numbers, light-hearted scenes of romance and comic interludes. I know that Shakespearean tragedies did sometimes make use of so-called "comic relief", but these scenes, like the porter scene in "Macbeth" or the gravedigger scene in "Hamlet" are generally characterised by a grim black humour, very different to the farcical slapstick on offer in "Sholay". The scenes involving Veeru and Jai's adventures in prison, or Veeru's romance with his pretty but talkative girlfriend Basanti, or the gypsy dance sequence, seem quite incongruous when set side by side with the serious parts of this film. This is, moreover, more than just a question of incongruity. These frequent diversions also slow down the main action and prevent it from developing smoothly and coherently. And yet this is clearly not a film which is intended to be judged by Western criteria. I am not a great expert on Indian cinema, but it seems clear that the conventions of Indian film-making are quite different to those which prevail in the West. (Indeed, the difference seems greater than that between Western films and those from other parts of Asia, such as China and Japan). This is clear not only from the "masala" structure of the film but also from much of the acting, especially Sanjeev Kumar's highly stylised, non-naturalistic portrayal of the Thakur. The film was not rated very highly when it came out; one critic described it as a "dead ember" (the literal meaning of "sholay" in Hindi), and it was, paradoxically, criticised for copying Western models too directly. Today, however, it is widely considered in India to be a classic. For this reason I find it a difficult film to review, and I have decided not to award it a mark out of ten, as such a mark would only reflect my own cultural background, a background very different from that of those who made the film and of those for whom it was intended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Overrated Hindi Film Ever: Pure Plagiarism!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before adding my own review of this widely acknowledged iconic film of Hindi cinema, I went through several of the reviews of this film. Majority of the reviewers appear to have been born just before or just after this film was first released in August 1975. In other words, they didn't experience it firsthand at theaters and were probably already preconditioned with all the incredible hype surrounding this film. I remember its original release at Minerva Theater in Bombay very well. I have seen this film in both its endings: The one in which the Gabbar Singh character gets killed by Thakur and the alternative ending where Thakur just stops short of killing Hari "Gabbar" Singh at the behest of the police. Salim Khan (father of actor Salman Khan) and Javed Akhtar wrote one of the most memorable dialogues for a Hindi film character in Gabbar Singh. However, this film's key storyline is nothing but a rip off of several classic Westerns: Both from Sergio Leone and from John Sturges' remake of Akira Kurosawa's SEVEN SAMURAI. Gabbar's killing of Thakur's family is nothing but a rip off of Henry Fonda's "Frank" who kills off the McBain family (including McBain's little boy) in Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. Amjad Khan (son of veteran Hindi film villain Jayant) owns this film. Without his interpretation of Gabbar Singh, this film would not be worth watching. With that being said, his interpretation of Gabbar is also a rip off of the great Italian actor Gian Maria Volonte's "Indio" from Leone's FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE. The base theme of SHOLAY is a Hindi reworking of SEVEN SAMURAI / THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. The vast majority of the Hindi film audience who praised SHOLAY to no end were not aware that its key points were plagiarized from the classic Italian and Hollywood Westerns. There were also some really silly scenes: Dharmendra's ridiculous mock "suicide"; the very annoying Basanti character of Hema Malini; etc. Aside from Gabbar Singh, the only interesting characters were that of Thakur (portrayed by Sanjeev Kumar) and Thakur's widowed daughter-in-law (portrayed by Jaya Bhaduri). Film director Ramesh Sippy ought to be ashamed of his plagiarism of the classic Westerns he ripped off and never openly credited. Aside from the key action scenes, SHOLAY really drags. SHOLAY is hardly a true "Hindi" film in the tradition of Golden Age classics of Hindi cinema which were truly Indian subjects (e.g., Roti-1942; Do Bigha Zamin; Pyaasa; Sahib, Bibi, aur Ghulam; Mughal-E-Azam; Pakeezah; etc.). SHOLAY is one of those movies which can be truly be labeled "Bollywood"...AKA when (way too often) Hindi cinema rips off Hollywood. Having seen SHOLAY in its 2nd week of release back in late August 1975 at Minerva Theater and a couple of times since, I can only state that SHOLAY is the most overrated Hindi film ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sholay: A Film That Keeps Calling You Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>+ Direction: This was Ramesh Sippy's first out-and-out action attempt. Every scene has been set-up with a lot of thought and it shows. The character treatment is one thing that is also quite unique about Sippy's direction.+ The duo of Amitabh and Dharmendra: Where do I start? Amitabh Bacchan plays the straight-faced ex-con. Dharmendra plays the quirky, playful, hopeless romantic. Both characters are poles apart in terms of their personalities, yet so close. So much that they would kill for each other.+ Gabbar Singh: Any good action/thriller would be incomplete without a good antagonist. Amjad Khan as Gabbar Singh is more than just good in Sholay. Khan plays a dacoit who is feared by the local villagers and is unrelenting in everything he does. Brutal, unforgiving, selfish, savage, barbaric, bloodthirsty, and vengeful. He encompasses all these adjectives and some more.+ Action: Sholay has some of the most iconic action sequences that excelled in every aspect. Technically sound and so well-executed.+ Performances: Sanjeev Kumar, Hema Malini and Jaya Bhaduri top the list in this department. Kumar plays the hapless but vengeful Thakur Baldev Singh who is out to do whatever is necessary to get his revenge from Gabbar Singh. Hema Malini plays the local horse-cart driver who lends some much needed comic relief with her never-ending barrage of words. Jaya Bhaduri plays the mellow and unassuming widow to Thakur's late son.+ Music: Every song compliments that particular moment in the film's timeline in which it features. That said, each one of them is a gem. Essentially 70's RD Burman in every sense.- Length: It's 188 minutes long. That's a little over 3 hours and that's long even by Hindi film standards. That said, there's not a single moment in the film where you feel the enormity of the length.Sholay can be termed as the first Westerner-inspired action classic, custom made for Bollywood. In essence, Sholay is a true blue revenge-action film. A film that gained cult status over these years. It shall always be the film that inspired many to at least try and make a film that can rule the hearts of millions.Every scene is a gem. Be it Jai and Veeru's first tonga ride with Basanti, Gabbar's reprimand when his cronies return empty-handed from the village, the Holi massacre and the subsequent scene with Thakur and Gabbar, the train shootout, or the climax. The list is just endless to be honest.Yours truly is guilty of having watched this gem many times over. There's no keeping count anymore. And one can't be blamed for it. It's a film that keeps calling you back.</fullReview>

Ramesh Sippy did really good job, all the actors and actresses are excellent.You probably know about the original scenes - Gabbar Death and Sachin as well, I still got these scenes on my DVD. I remember when I watched it on video in early 1988 and again in 1996, it has English and arabic subtitles,the ending scene which Gabbar got arrest. Interesting, no-one know and never seen that one scene is still missing, when Basanti went to see Jai &amp; Veeru and talked about their friendship, approx 1 mins. I remember some lines, Hema said 'You two seem very close friends', Dharamendra said 'We became very close friend when we were child and we never separate since then', this scene is not available on DVD or streaming online except the old video if it's still out there.Buy DVD right now and watch it, you won't be disappointed.

		<shortDescription>Film Review for 'Sholay'1975</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film Review:Movie 'Sholay' -after the many decades.Indian film-history made a record,while the movie 'Sholay' became Bellwood's most successful,product. The year exactly 1980,it has been permitted to release in 'Minerva Theatre'.Undoughtably it had carried in Matine on public demand. Director Ramesh Sippy and the Producer G.P Sippy had their great challenge to make this cinema absolutely Unix. The rich drama narrates the holistic Indian cultures and it's greater part of history. That type condition and the ritualistic situations.The movie had released on 15th August 1975. Absolutely Unix but there is a myth behind the story cultures. The characters are here- Veeru,Jai,Gabbar,the Thakur,Basanti,Radha,Soorma Bhopali and Sambha. Total entertainment is nothing but a folklore,Deshi Bharatiya cinema,with budding romance between Hema Malini and Dharmendra,and Amitabh-Jaya tragedy.The whole drama narrates over some Indian Popular Culture. Critique might argue that 'Mother India',or 'Mughle-Azam' were better films,but the truth is movie 'Sholay' can rival in the scale and longevity. There was an auto rickshaw in Patna,named Dhanno-one rear-horse. Basanti was perfect rider cum car-driver,who would bear this rick saw from one place to another. She was always smiley onto her face. Very bright- quarreling type lady. She could compromise everything for other,even her dearest Veeru(her boy-friend),whom she loved. The two boys-Veeru and Jai planned to come in a place of Thakur's meeting for a request. Amitabh was cast as 'Jai',who had been the character with a big-draw.Similarly Sanjeev-the one and only Bellwood old hero artist,had played here the eminent role of Thakur,absolutely 'khandani ad mi'once he was a reputed police officer.Thakur Baldev Singh became the police officer and had identified the great deco-it- Gabbar Singh,the legend was so against Khaki uniforms,that he was captured and desperately protested that he wasn't a policeman. Salim Javed described desperately Gabbar and Sambha,who were grew in a stature. Gabbar lived in a place,somewhere in Uttarpradesh. Writter tried to show the income of Gabbar Singh,approx 5000 per day but his arrogant behavior,probably ordered a boast for him. Sambha and Gabbar's echo,were then integrated into a screen play. The colorful scenario integrated the happening between Ram and Ravan. Because the ultimately Gabbar was the villain,may be he was unattached from Thakur. It is questionable why Thakur tried to kill Gabbar,without any protections,and finally Thakur Baldev Singh was almost defeated by the villain and had considered to sell his two hands to Gabbar. Gabbar's language was so powerful-'Ye Haath Hame De De Thakur'. The violence disturbed Thakur,but the no matter that ending life is the matter of success for Ram,and overthrow to Ravan. There was a controversy between Gabbar's and Thakur's family,and the movie'Sholay'enterprises the complicated scenes,establishing the family disappearance. The scene was Thakur Baldev Singh came,and on the scene after Gabbar,and his boys,had slaughtered his family and retreated. It underlined the tragedy the sense of doom. The songs were relevant,there were many schedules and involved hundreds dances. The dance-'Mehebuba'-made a total perfections of entertainment. It was the habit of Gabbar,what he really enjoyed. There were also dance of Hema Malini,who was the good performer,and kept her words to Gabbar. It was the spirit of male anthem,which would enable the cast and crew to use different kinds of camera angles. Mainly Basanti was dancing to save Veeru's life.Sambha attempt to gun at Veeru after Gabbar's orders to Basanti ?She danced and- Gabbar-well said- 'Jab Tera pa-on challenge,sans challenge;jab Tera pa-on rule to ye Banduk challenge'. Basanti's struggled refer the dancing moment under the scorching heat,and sun had to look real to be effective. In the climax sequence,Gabbar holds Basanti's arm and menacingly delivers the lines: "Dekho Chhamiya,wo mat karo,nahi to ye gory Hali Na-Saree bad-an Se utaar dungi." Ramesh was confirmed about Hema's personality, She trusted him. She admitted her feelings to Dharmendra. Once they planned to marry.There were some other scenes amidst the whole cine-perfections,sometimes the response was simply,but the actions were created the bunch of very brave personality of Jai,who was able to perform alone. It was Jai's mentality,who turned over his mind from Veeru and Basanti's mind. Radha was failed to protect but Jai was not obliged to maintain her words. Real bullets' added in Jai's faith and in the climax,Jai had rescued by Veeru and Basanti,after holding their hands,had shown his respect to the couple. Blessed them,it took the scene silence.Movie 'Sholay',turns over some Hollywood Western. Director Ramesh had depicted just like pioneer,to the wild-west for just a reason. The whole narrative translate the absolute continuity of South Indian classical cultures,with obeying some ritualistic,even orthodox pattern. There had sweet courage's,and adore of every members,had big reasons,deep sorrow,and 'Sholay's' magic has come from there. This is there story.A publicity blitz announced the coming of 'Sholay'. The demand for ticket was so high,that in some theater managed,just put there publicity on the hook. Finally there was a big publicity,people had started queuing up outside the theaters at the night,and when the time had come. Whatever the biggest challenge of the director and the producer,both were actively placed the film,in a completely narrative way. No doubt the whole cine-narrative is the defining history of Indian cultures,and that time scenario,what happened on the British era. There had slight socio background amidst the cine-cultures always. Special credits for the entire team-mate.The End.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MY REVIEW: The Ageless Bollywoodish Entertainer!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As said by a critic; 3D, 2D or no D, Sholay is still D for Delicious. It's an ageless entertainer made from all bollywoodish ingredients; Songs, dance, melodrama, dialogs etc. But make no mistake, there is undeniably excellent storytelling, well developed characters, an engaging emotional script with ample scope of ruthless action, sincere performances by all lead actors, first rate background score and technically apt direction. For nitpicking, you can say that more than 3 hours is too long and few scenes could have been edited but the charm of this movie is too magnetic that even after 38 years, it is able to fill half of the seats of the theater on its re-release. I may not agree that this is the greatest story ever told but yes it is the finest commercial effort till date by Bollywood. For those who have doubts, Sholay in new 3D format with digitally enhanced sound and picture quality is worth every single penny of your expensive ticket. What a way to start 2014 in theaters!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Reviewed on the basis of watching on VCD 30 years after release)Plot: Two petty thieves are hired by an ex-policeman to capture a most- wanted bandit. Will they succeed in the toughest mission of their life?Review: The 70's decade is considered the 'golden era of Bollywood'. If that's true, then 'Sholay' is it's brightest jewel! Honestly, this film can't be rated or reviewed; but I offer this as a humble tribute as to what this writer thought of this film which is much more than just cinema.It is widely believed, what is there in this world is there in the 'Mahabharata' and what is not in it, is nowhere. The same ideology applies in the case of 'Sholay'. All possible spices that one can add in a mainstream potboiler is present in this film and nothing else could have been added more. It boasts of everything in top quality with the whole cast &amp; crew in top form.First the star cast comprising of 3 top heroes and 2 heroines with a newcomer villain who turns out to be the biggest star of all, Amjad Khan. But unlike other multi-starers all the stars have roles which fit them to the tee; and what performances they deliver! Did Sanjeev Kumar ever let us feel that he is actually two decades younger than 'Thakur'; or that Amjad was a dbutante? Dharmendra and Hema Malini are naturals as the effusive and bubbly 'Veeru' and 'Basanti' respectively. But Amitabh and Jaya as 'Jai' and 'Radha' are revelations. They manage to leave a lasting impression with their body language and personality despite limited dialogs. But the best part is that even the small roles of A.K.Hangal, Asrani and Jagdeep also become memorable.Director Ramesh Sippy excelled in his choice of locations for 'Ramgarh' with the dry, hilly, rocky terrain of Rama Nagar creating a village- scape that one never saw previously in Bollywood. One hardly sees the clich sights of river-banks and farmlands depicting villages in other films. The way he handled the scene of Gabbar attacking Thakur's family was masterful. The action scenes, especially where Jai fends the goons alone, is executed realistically and at occasions innovative. He inducts a new style of direction.The script by Salim-Javed is a master-piece. It has all ingredients of action, 2 contrasting kinds of romance, tragedy, comedy and social message (widow re-marriage). Even the small characters become a highlight. And equally immortal are the dialogs ranging from hilarious to bone-chilling, especially Gabbar's. We know we are in for a treat when at the start, the officer delivers this gem:'I don't know what work you have for them, but I know they are absolutely of no work.' The only loophole being the inaction of police who despite knowledge of Gabbar's hideout don't mount an attack on him; instead they announce rewards for others to catch him!R.D.Burman as usual delivers with 'yeh dosti','mehbooba' and 'haan jab tak hain jaan'. But his background score outscores his songs with the opening theme, Jai's mouth-organ melody and the screeching sound of a swing when Thakur sees his family. He must also be lauded for not giving any music in the scene where Jai alone fends the goons. It lend-ed a superb eerie feel to raise the tension!Special mention must also be made of Dwarka Divecha for his riveting camera-work (especially in the train sequence which in itself is a highlight), the foreign fight-masters and choreographer P.L.Raj for his innovative sequences especially in 'Yeh dosti'.'Sholay' set new standards in all departments of film-making. If the world were to end this year, then this is the film one must watch before leaving.Box Office Verdict: Despite a lukewarm opening due to lackluster reviews and posters(the only low point of the film with the only person recognizable being Amjad, a dbutante!) the film expectedly broke all records. But more important is the cult status it has attained in the minds of all Indians with all the characters, songs and of-course the dialogs(specially 'yeh haath mujhe de de Thakur') getting iconic status. Above all you can't be an Indian if you haven't seen 'SHOLAY'!</fullReview>

Agreed,the movie draws inspiration from many western movies.But thats nothing to be ashamed at.In present days,filmmakers are almost making remakes while copying ideas...that must be avoided but taking inspiration is not bad.moreover what made sholay so successful are the performances..especially the aspect of dialogues and dialogue delivery...now that wasn't copied...the whole actress aspect wasn't lifted and is so much loved. Gabbar sing became a huge huge success...33 years later I played this character in my college fest and I was a star after that.such is the craze level of this character. I agree it isn't that great in technical terms or in matters of storyline..but the fact remains that everything in the movie fits in so perfectly.You can take all the tasty ingredients but unless you have a perfect mixture,you wont have the perfect taste....this is what sholay is...a perfect mixture...That will remain something to be proud of.</fullReview>

Therefore in other words, I would say the film is very interesting and a worth watch. The friendship of Jai and Veeru has been shown so strong, it just reminds me some of my old buddies at school.

The nice mix of excellently shot chase sequences on horses and trains, the battles of guns and unarmed combat,the unforgettable comedy of Soorma Bhopali and the dances by Hema Malini. Even with the Full stable of Hindi movie cliches and predictability of the movie it remains the best and unmatched in its league. Amjad Khan (unbelievably slim in the movie) set the tone for a whole generation of villains.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fantastic movie and a must watch for all movie lovers. Although the ending is somewhat sad (in my opinion) the movie is an icon for Indian cinema. Never before had any single movie brought together such great actors and given each actor a lead role. The characters in the movie are very powerful and very well depicted. The theme of the movie was also very refreshing and the dialogues of the movie have been etched in each and every mind. Furthermore the songs are very melodic. It would have been fantastic had the movie been available on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the best - east or west *very slight spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The action, the dialogue, the plot, the characters, the story, the setting and even the music pull together incredibly strongly to create one of the most memorable and perfectly realized films ever committed to the big screen. There are all Bollywood films ever made on the one hand and then there is Sholay in a category of its own. Take one 'Once Upon A Time In The West' as a basic foundation, add the best aspects of Le Samourai, Star Wars, Jaws, Terms Of Endearment, Grease and Midnight Run, transplant to the parched red-clay landscapes of Southern India circa 1975 and you have a film called Sholay. Calling it a curry western is like calling Citizen Kane a detective story. There's more, so much more. While most Indians will score this film 10/10, non-Indians will probably only score it a 7 - the film is absolutely and deeply marinated in Indian sensibilities which touch thrillingly at the heartstrings of the Indian soul. As much a cultural document as a film. P.S. Note how a train signals the beginning and end of the story, note how high-voltage action scenes alternate with light-hearted comedy all the way through the film and note how four types of man (or levels of consciousness) are manifest through the characters - the reprobate (Gabbar), the wayward (Jai and Veeru), the brave (Thakur) and the saintly (the old Muslim man). This one's a humdinger !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably one of the best Indian movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I review this movie..Id like to make a statement: Indian, especially Hindi movies will not appeal to the western user unless he his very familiar with indian culture /asian culture. Indian movies are very popular in almost the whole world except for the americas, western europe, and south east asia including japan and china.Sholay is probably the most popular hindi movie ever made. It was made in 1975 and played a very important part in establishing amitabh bachhan as the superstar of hindi cinema. It made a small time character actor named amjad khan into one of the most famous movie stars in India. The plot is relatively simple and straight forward with the normal love story, violence evil v/s good, etcc in a hindi movie. What makes it outstanding are the brilliant dialogues, the amazing performance especially the ease with which the two lead stars amitabh and dharmendra switch from comedy to action at the drop of the hat. The movie also contains probably the most famous lines delivered in bollywood namely "Kitne aadmi the?" or "How many men were they?"It is an evergreen movie , and even 30 years later it rocks...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented "Sholay" from an Indian store around where I live and I loved every moment of it! It's funny, sad, romantic, and very ACTION PACKED! Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan have excellent chemistry. I loved the the Buddy Buddy song they sing together, it's really cute and funny but "Holi Ke Din" is the BEST song! I was particularly touched by the "silent" love between Bachchan and his real life wife Jaya Bhaduri. The movie is well acted, Bachchan's character reminded me of James Dean and Steven McQueen. And I was haunted by Bhaduri's performance. On a shallow note, the lead men in this movie are some serious eye candy, especially Bachchan. I was thought he was a handsome guy back in the day, (Hell, he still is!) but in Sholay, he's so incredibly GORGEOUS! I mean, I was drooling over him! This movie is a must see for Bachchan fans.P.S. Parents, this movie is VERY,VERY, VERY violent! Children and young adults are killed brutally. It's a PG-13er all the way...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In spite of initial negative reviews, Sholay became, thanks to word of mouth, a huge hit and an acknowledged classic. It is also, by Western standards, a bit of a mess, and something that would be a better movie with an hour chopped out.The movie is shot like a western (although in spite of initial impressions it's not a period piece) and is gorgeously scenic. The opening train action sequence is good, though not great, and it illustrates an issue seen throughout the movie: it's clear no fist ever comes close to a face and the fighting has an over-choreographed look that makes it unconvincing.This is followed by the film's nadir, a painfully unfunny "comic" sequence about a prison martinet with a Hitler mustache. Not only is it the worst part of the movie, but it's also completely unnecessary; it adds nothing to the movie. Then there's a musical number. This seems odd, but it turns out Sholay is a western-musical-action picture. Go figure.If you can make it that far (about 45 minutes in) then things pick up with a talkative horse-cart driver whose amusing, narcissistic chattering proves that the movie can be funny if it tries. Sholay has the look of a 50s-era western, but it also has the darkness that moved into cinema in the 60s and 70s. The most effective movies are its darkest, and once the film shows that side (towards the middle), the action, broad comedy, suspense, romance, drama, and even dancing, work pretty well. Like the Seven Samurai, Sholay is about heroes protecting a village from bandits, but unlike the Kurosawa film, these heroes have no sense of strategy. It is amazing how it never occurs to anyone in the film to take any precautions or even consider for a moment that being surrounded by bandits probably makes a lot of things dangerous. In spite of a few grim moments, overall Sholay is your basic popcorn flick, and something I probably would have enjoyed more when I was 14 watching a Saturday afternoon movie marathon. 3 1/2 hours long and crossing genres willy-nilly, Sholay really *is* a movie marathon. Cut a few scenes out and trim pretty much everything that's left and Sholay would be a much better movie. As it is, it's a bit of a curio that I can't quite recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Entertainer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When SHOLAY was started,little did people know it would be such a blockbuster,in fact the first month had so low attendance that it was about to removed from theatres but then things changed. The film may not have a really original story, in fact it seems the film was loosely styled after Akira Kurosawa's 1954 film Seven Samurai, and drew heavily from the conventions of Westerns, especially Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns such as Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), and John Sturges' film The Magnificent Seven (1960). Sholay was also influenced by the westerns of Sam Peckinpah, such as The Wild Bunch (1969) and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973); and by George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). A scene depicting an attempted train robbery was inspired by a similar scene in North West Frontier (1959) and a scene showing the massacre of Thakur's family has been compared with the massacre of the McBain family in Once Upon a Time in the West, Some plot elements were borrowed from the Indian films Mera Gaon Mera Desh (1971) and Khote Sikkay (1973) Strangely it became such a cult film that many films were inspired from it, like Joshilay,China Gate and the recent disaster Elaan(2005). The film is very entertaining, Salim-Javed did a great job with the film. The first half is more on establishing characters, but there are several brilliant scenes like Amitabh and Dharam introduction when they stop robbers from looting a train, their scenes with Sanjeev Kumar,Dharam scenes with Hema, Gabbar's Introduction, The Interval point. The film is a bit lengthy though as in those days. The second half focuses more on Amitabh and Dharam seeking revenge and we also have comedy and romance and the last finale though prolonged is superb,Amitabh's death is simply superb, while Dharam fighting with Amjad and then Sanjeev fighting with Amjad is superb. In fact the end was changed after Censors rejected the end thinking it will affect people's minds seeing a cop killing a goon(In the original end it was supposed to have Sanjeev kill Amjad) and it was changed to the cops arriving, Even Sachin's death scene was cut off.Direction by Ramesh Sippy is too good Music by RD Burman is superb, be it YEH DOSTI sung by Kishore Kumar and Manna Dey which is the anthem of friendship songs, Holi Ke Din, Mehbooba all superb songs. The film is one of the 70mm films of Bollywood The recent 3D Version though gimmicky but was well done, especially considering making a 3D film of a 70s film. The film also was one of the first films to use stereo for recordingAmongst actors Sanjeev Kumar is simply terrific as Thakur, those days he was known as a comic actor more but this film silenced and surprised people,Though he was young he portrayed Thakur superbly Dharmendra is simply superb as Veeru, he is superb in comedy and dramatic scenes, in his inimitable style Amitabh Bachchan signed the film before Zanjeer hence he plays second fiddle but does a superb job as the silent Jai. Hema Malini is hilarious as Basanti and became famous Jaya Pradha plays the silent widower superbly though in one scene of her flashback she is shown full of life and is superb there too, just like her other films like MILI,GUDDI she displays her fun side in that scene superbly. Amjad Khan in his debut though he did small roles before is simply outstanding, evoking terror and hatred though his length of the role was small, People remember SHOLAY for Gabbar more then any character Satyen Kapoo,Macmohan are all good, In fact even minor characters like Viju Khote who played Kaalia were remembered, rest are good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a near legendary film that retains most of its appeal even on multiple viewings. The plot is simple, basically a riff on Seven Samurai and has been copied umpteen times in Hindi films, though none have reached Sholay's intensity. Amjad Khan's iconic villain makes the film. His one-liners are a delight and remain impressive. Dharamendra struts his stuff though its a quiet Amitabh who has greater screen presence. The film is very long and some aspects are obviously copied from Sergio Leone's westerns. Yet it remains enjoyable from start to end. Worth watching.Overall 8/10</fullReview>

The path, a treacherous one filled with dacoits riding high on their horses has Basanti scaling the tracks skillfully and also picking up weapons and other freebies to get to Ramgarh before dark.The game is already witnessing huge number of hits due to its indigenous flavor, something with which everyone can identify.

		<fullReview>Two Friends who are like brothers, get into a spot when they agree to bring in a notorious dacoit for a person, alive. The cops have got a healthy tag on his head (Dead or Alive) but this man wants him alive, to avenge his family's death. Amidst all this things turn personal when the dacoit captures a village girl the love of Viru's life and kills Jai in action. The short tempered Viru gets infuriated by the death of his best friend and gets the job done by capturing Gabbar, the dacoit.One of the landmarks in Indian movie history, Sholay is just another story of the life style in a typical village in the late 60's and early 70's. Common thieves snaking their way out of prison, boys falling in love with simple village girls. Ramesh Sippy brings out the story very clearly through a lucid script and Amitabh Bachchan and Dharmendra play the part of the two inseparable friends Jai and Viru to perfection. Amjad Khan, the man who went on to become the villain for many future movies, makes a superb debut with Gabbar. Hema Malini plays the role of the simple but outspoken village girl very well and Jaya Bhaduri is also marvelous as the widow of the landlord. But the entire movie stands out and is based on two characters. Gabbar and Thakur. Sanjeev Kumar gives a mind blowing performance as the handicapped thakur, a retired police inspector who is crippled by Gabbar, for sending him to jail. As a consequence for his actions he kills off Thankur's family members sparing him and his youngest daughter in law. An excellent movie which also brings out the smooth and melodious music which creates a grim emotion for the viewer. Overall, it is well worth watching and it may be considered to be a "The Good, Bad and The Ugly" of the east. 10/10 from me..........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't think much of Sholay till I actually saw it. I can understand why it's so famous.First of all...the acting! Ah! Just wonderful.Dharmendra plays the hero, who is basically comical...even while he's getting arrested. I mean, his jokes are just hilarious! And those funny faces he makes! I couldn't stop laughing! Then there's his best friend, who is played by Amitabh. Though Amitabh is not as goofy as his friend, he is funny. He makes all sarcastic comments and you can see why he shot into superstardom with his performance.Though I never thought Hema Malini was a good actress...trust me, in this movie she is sooooo funny. The girl just can't stop talking! The scenes with Dharmendra and her are really funny. Then of course there's Jaya Bhaduri, who is more of the depressed type, and her and Amitabh fall in love just by sharing glances, it's awfully cute. Her gloomy look is very effective.Let's not forget Sanjeev Kumar, a good strong performance. He makes a dark voice that really adds effect on his character. At first he seems heartless, but later you realize that he does really care.The only performance that was not so good was Amjad Khan's, though many liked it. His stupid accent was not very enjoyable and it seemed like he was trying to get bhojpuri into his dialect when he shouldn't have been.So there are cons in this movie...the violence is not very good. I mean, I enjoy fist fights, but there's only one in this movie and the rest in like gun shots...which I think is boring. The music could've been much better. The only good songs are "Haan Jab Tak" and the other one that's okay was "Holi Ke Din". I think if Ramesh Sippy had taken someone like Laxmikant Pyarelal, the music would've been much much better.The beginning is really funny, Asrani as the overacting jailor is hilarious. The movie is very touching at the end though, very sad I'll have to say. Even though I'm telling you all the cons in the movie, I'm not saying that you shouldn't watch it...because you should! After watching this movie Dharmendra and Amitabh have become my favorite actors. It's a great movie, even though I have some stuff against it, because of the comedy and performances...I'll have to give it a ten out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's an Indian Cowboy Movie in the mould of SEVEN SAMURAI and YOJIMBO!A retired police captain recruits two career criminals to help him defend his village from a group of particularly nasty bandits. The two crooks are apparently the bravest men he ever met - and pretty good natured fellows too, for that matter. They agree to take the job, initially just for the cash, but gradually because they come to like the villagers and their lifestyle. Everything is rosy as they fend off the first bandit invasions, but everybody knows that bandits whose power rests totally on fear can't let it go when they suffer a loss.The movie doesn't really deviate too far from the genre format, but in its 3.5 hour runtime it gets chance to develop the story to quite a degree, and it's a pretty well crafted movie. I did shorten that runtime a little by forwarding through a couple of songs, but it still clocked in at 3+ hours and kept my interest throughout. The main reason for this is the performances - a good one from Dharmendra as one of the crooks, and a fantastic one from young Amitabh Bachchan as the other. Apparently this is the movie that made Amitabh a superstar, and you can see why. He easily steals the screen from the then more famous Dharmendra, oozing cool like James Dean on Quaaludes. Even he is sometimes in danger of losing screen command from their nemesis, the nasty bandit head Gabbar Singh (played by Amjad Khan). He's a villain who is given a lot more depth and character development than villains normally get in a movie. He's a bastard, for sure, but whilst you dislike him you also understand him, and perhaps secretly admire him.The character dynamics, and the cat and mouse play between our heroes and our villains are all very confidently handled, and deftly shaped. There's quite a bit of action, some of which is rather bad (the 'oh, you hit me - I should fall over now then' school of stuntmen), but some of which is quite thrilling. There's some comedy, mostly from the chatterbox village taxi girl and Dharmendra's attempts to seduce her, there's some melodrama and some pathos... and there's Amitabh nonchalantly wandering through it all like a king (it's hard to remember he's meant to be the 'sidekick' here). There's some song and dance routines naturally, though personally I wasn't too keen on some of the songs.SHOLAY is apparently considered to be one of the all time classics of Indian cinema. I haven't really seen enough Indian movies, especially pre-90's, to judge this, but I think the verdict is perhaps coloured slightly by nostalgia - or maybe needs to be seen in historical context. I don't think it's better than SATYA or ZAKHM anyway. I don't think it's quite as good as the Kurosawa movies that defined this genre either, but it's still rather a good movie :).</fullReview>

To value this movie I made my own version by cutting out 70 minutes of unnecessary side and back stories which makes this movie tedious and boring. My cut is a 135 (instead of 204) minutes movie, full of action with increased pace. I deleted the songs "Ye Dosti" "Holi Ke din" "Koi Haseena", the background story of Jaya Bahaduri, the Asrani sequence in jail and Mausi's approval for having Veeru engaged to Basanti.

Although they really wish kids in Paloma would be enthralled by Tarkovsky, 'Sholay' is an example of popular cinema that neither panders, patronises nor bludgeons its audience, and, while providing the most exhilirating melange of comedy, violence, romance and song, as all action films should, but never do, it wires the audience's visceral excitement to more thoughtful ends. This does not mean - the horror! - that it is an art film in action clothing, as some of its embarrassed allies insist on calling it; there is not one moment here, transposed, that would stick out in a Hollywood movie (well, maybe the songs). It is the manner of presenting the action and humour that might get a viewer thinking, about genre, tone, what subjects are appropriate to be shown, how they should be shown, etc. it's a huge, but achievable, step from thinking about the nature of a film to questioning the society that produced it.I don't know much about Bollywood cinema, but I do know about Westerns, and 'Sholay', heavily influenced by the spaghettis, has been called, either dismissively, or affectionately, a 'curry' Western. Such a term does have the virtue of hinting at the density and, dare I say it, spicy potency of the film. The most obvious influence is Leone, in the way a specifically American genre is wrenched out of context and made strange; in the unsettling mixture of flippancy and deadly seriousness; in playing havoc with the conventions of the genre, expressing especially its latent campness; in the elaborate gunplay and extended mini-film flashbacks; in the sharp lurches from spatial depth to juttering montage; in the glorious stew of a score, mixing the required Bollywood dance routines (here brilliantly subversive, elaborate and funny) with weirdly inappropriate Western themes, played on a mournful harmonica. There are more literal homages to Leone, especially 'Once upon a time in the West' - the importance of trains; the tangible creak of wood; the comical extras on the periphery; the El Indio-like sweating villain; the virtual remake of the McBain slaughter in 'West', where a cold-blooded avenger massacres an entire family. This last transposing is particularly effective because of its reversal of gender, and the ghostly unveiling of the corpses by the wind has an overpowering effect. Whereas leone, however, took the Western out of America to fiercely critique the ideological assumptions of the Western; the Sippis take it to energise Bollywood formulae; but there is a political awareness amid the escapism, a sense of the random violence and division inherent in post-colonial India. Plot elements lifted wholesale from the likes of 'The Magnificent Seven', via 'The Seven Samurai' (bandits defend village from marauders), and 'The Wild Bunch' (the second most awesome train sequence in movies), emphasise this. The politics seem to be moving toward the regressive, despite the stylistic pyrotechnics - the heroes defend a feudal system; their criminal transgression (and homo-erotic co-dependence) slowly abandoned as they accept marriage and children, just as the strong female character, the only one who appears to work in the village, and who has unmistakably a 'voice', wants to settle down. The villain is clearly Communist - his purges are Stalinist, his beard and green uniform are Castro, his cruelties are anti-family. His propaganda briefly encourages the locals to rise against their lord. Everything seems to be heading for reactionary restoration and renewal. It doesn't work like that. As the film progresses towards its horrific denouement, the formal aspects become more troubling, the mix of comedy and tragedy more uneasy - a man's hands being lopped off registered by a punning edit: is this funny or horrifying? The dance movements - supposedly a Bakhtinian suspension of everyday order, by suspending narrative order, celebrating the Carnivalesque - are deprived of pleasurability. When the heroine is forced to dance to save her lover's live - a mode so bound up in sexual gratification of the male viewer becomes tantamount to a gang-rape. The vengeance that consumes the Inspector poisons any chance of a return to order - all the references to Shakespeare remind us of another prominent patriarch whose family was destroyed, and who had his hand cut off, Titus Andronicus. I don't want to make the film sound gloomy - it is every Buster Keaton short ever rolled into one, remade by Leone in the style of Peckinpah with brilliantly silly English-style farce. But it's even more than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sippy makes a commercial success of a run-of-the-mill western remade in the Indian context. The movie was adapted also to fit the expectations of the Indian filmgoers. Amjad Khan in the debut role steals the show. This movie also inspired a number of movies such as Shaan. The strength of this movie doesn't lie in its great directorial prowess (Sippy does a passable job) or even the acting, but in the way it captured the imagination of the whole movie-going Indian public. Unfortunately Sippy also tries to add all the standard cliches (like the poor blind Muslim cleric, the nice and naive village girl) and created others for other film-makers to imitate. Definitely a good movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a monumental feat, that cannot be paralleled in the history of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is the most perfect movie I have ever seen in my life. From the casting, to the direction to the performances. But the most amazing feat was achieved by Amjad Khan. Even today, people remember Gabbar Singh, the infamous dacoit played superbly by Amjad Khan. His opening scene is known to every Indian kid like a poem in the English class..."Kitney aadmi they?...". In comparison, people seldom remember that Amitabh's name was Jai and Dharmendra's name was Veeru in that movie. This is not to play down their roles. It just amazes me how a new-comer could side-line such stalwarts. Ramesh Sippy has not been able to repeat his directorial performance, with "Shakti" not living up to its promise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A steam train pulls into a lone, shabby station. A stranger gets off and meets with a horseman. They mount and ride through valleys and plains to a village where the stranger meets with a former lawman who orders him to track down two outlaws. They're to help him rid his village from a gang of bandits. No, we're not in the West, we're in the East: Sholay is a Bollywood movie that can best be described as a curry-western. There's some odious comic relief in some of the early scenes, but that soon subsides for hot-blooded action, stand-offs, gunfights and explosions. Amitabh Bachchan and Dharmendra make a fine pair of outlaw-heroes going up against a truly menacing villain (Amjad Khan). Director Ramesh Sippy sure knows his Leone, but he's more than a mere imitator: there's a scene in which a whole family is murdered by the baddies that is similar to the scene at the start of Once Upon a Time In the West, but is filmed with a virtuosity all its own.Western-fans take note: Sholay is a great entry in the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What "Gone With The Wind" is to HollyWood, Sholay is to Hindi Cinema: The pinnacle of success. This is one of the movies that will be without much doubt be the best Hindi movie of this millenium. This is not because of the money it made. As a matter of fact, some new movies have overtaken the box office collections of Sholay. However, it is the fact that this movie has captured the hearts of millions of Indians. It had all the ingredients that have now become the rules of making a movie in India: Action, romance, songs and tragedy. The movie had Amitabh Bachan as the serious hero along with theDharmender playing the comic/action lead. Hema Malini as the Tanga(Horse coach) driver made a mark with the movie. Sanjeev Kumar played the towering role of a man yearning for revenge. But Amjad Khan who played "Gabbar Singh" took the cake. Almost all his dialogues are known to every Indian true to his salt. The songs were huge hits and the song "Yeh Dosti" (This Friendship..) is one of the best songs about friendship. This is one of the movies anyone who wants to know anything about Indian Cinema should watch. And I assure you, you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

It didn't.I'm not saying that this is a bad movie. It is just a very Indian movie.The acting is corny, the script is basic, and the story is a retread. But every now and then there is a song and a dance.So it is Bollywood meets spaghetti western. I'll stick with the Italian versions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, this has to be the single most over hyped movie "bollywood" has ever produced. I mean what the hell! Slow movie combined with horrible acting and extremely stupid story line, not to mention the absolutely meaningless song and dance scenes pasted into this chaotic collage of scenes. The story clearly taken out of Seven samurai and The Good the Bad and the Ugly, but doesn't do even a % of justice to the film. I cannot fathom how such movies are being gobbled down by the culture here. Simply stupid and a big waste of time. Do not watch this movie! PS : Ashamed of my own culture. The lack of maturity is astounding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Often overrated or seen-too-much by so-called "film critics" and 'bollywood' viewers, THIS MOVIE IS NOT A MASTERPIECE!!! why? first of all Darmendra overacts in most parts of the film. I have seen many scenes of this film taken from 'The good, the bad and the ugly' in 1966. When they can't do anything original, don't even copy then!! what they do is add some few songs to the film to make it longer, add an actress or dancer who will dance and entertain the bollywood viewers who become greatly impressed by the copied actions and scenes in the film. Bollywood viewers need to watch more and more variety films to know what is really going on here and not just clapping their hands to something that is not worth so much reputation and glamour. The director and producer of this film boast so much about something they have copied and even get great awards for this plagiarism. To whom should the credit really go? WATCH THE FILM I HAVE MENTIONED ABOVE FOR FURTHER DETAILS YOU WILL EXPERIENCE YOURSELVES.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not this Westerner's cup of tea at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand that for followers of Bollywood cinema this was a huge success with an all-star cast and holds a special place in their hearts. That's what drew me to watch it.I found it horrible. How can I list all the turn-offs? The opening scenes struck me as bizarre in their imitation of Hollywood westerns, with the horses, gun fights, and bandits chasing a train. Why did they do that, for goodness sake? Not long after, in what started as a serious action-drama, the two hardened thieves stole a motorcycle with a side-car and launched into a long, very long, extremely long, song, suddenly giving the movie the feel of an el cheapo Elvis Presley flic. It was completely out of character, like inserting a cartoon in the middle of a drama. Weird. And now I need to mention the music, especially that horrid, tinny sound of strings that is so gratingly typical of Bollywood movies (are they violins recorded in a $2.95 microphone?). Unlistenable. Later there were the usual Bollywood dance sequences that I personally find silly and yucky. Again, they had no place in the middle of a drama. I suppose the idea was to give audiences a little bit of everything; for me the result was like serving a dish made of pizza, ice cream, poutine and pickled herring. The action scenes were overdone, much too long, the fights going on and on until I wanted to take out a newspaper and do some reading until they were over.If Indians--and the occasional Westerner--love this stuff, fine and dandy, let them enjoy, but to me, and I suspect to most Westerners, it's beyond the pale.That's not to say great movies can't come out of India. Of course, there are the old Satyajit Ray films, but in more recent times I was knocked out by The Bandit Queen. I'd love to see more films like that. But none of these were "Bollywood," which, in my opinion, does not travel, leaving general audiences outside the culture cold.</fullReview>

I cant recall the last historical document that referred to India as 'East India'.Its interesting though that this guy, whose knowledge of countries beyond the North American continent seems next only to George Bush Jr's spent 3 hours of his time watching a movie from India. Sholay never made any claims to be 'artsy' or 'intellectually stimulating'. It was a regular Indian movie with its usual mix of melodrama, humor and action that the average Indian audience has come to accept. Nothing more; nothing less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes great, but owing great DEBT to Sergio Leone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no doubt that this film is a milestone in Hindi movies. However, the emotional effect it had on some other reviewers, and the general sweeping, grand quality to the film, are no doubt mostly due to the devices stolen from the Italian Director Sergio Leone. What would the Western be without Leone?--An Italian showed the world the new way to think of "American" Western. Sholay constantly steals; just watch FIST FULL OF DOLLARS, FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, and THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY. Most people are familiar with these, but not so much (at least maybe not Indian viewers) with ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. This Leone epic is where the major dramatic scenes are stolen from. The scene in Sholay where Gabbar's men shoot each member of the Inspector's family (including the little boy) is stolen verbatim, and if you thought that was "powerful,", you'll see that Leone did it much better than Sippy. The great thing about this movie to me is that even though it "copies" all these other Westerns, it seems so natural because of the similarities in setting. The hot, arid Indian plain could be Mexico or Texas or Arizona. Gabbar and his men are undifferentiable from Mexican bandits. The lonely trains, the horses, and the lawless towns are all there, and thus the Western themes ring true there too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a let down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My father and I anxiously popped in this DVD that was suggested by a friend. After reading many reviews and seeing the high rating on IMDb I thought we were in for a real treat. What a load of garbage this movie turned out to be. A combination of all the wrong ingredients for a epic western. Growing up on Rio Bravo, Bite the Bullet and The Professionals I couldn't wait for Sholay to end. Sholay is three hours of total misunderstanding of Western movie culture. My view of Bollywood movies has been tainted for quite a while with this movie. John Wayne would be rolling over in his grave if he saw two-cowboys in leisure suits, with poor comic relief. I will describe one seen from the movie. The two wanted heroes get caught and are serving jail time. The new warden at the jail is a poor representation of Charlie Chaplin playing Hitler. That was one of the few highlights... In conclusion this is a horrible movie that tries to mesh musicals, comedy, and drama from Western culture into a Bollywood hit. It might have worked for Bollywood, but any fan of Hollywood westerns would be smart to steer clear of this crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe that this is considered one of the greatest Indian films ever. The acting throughout is comical and unsubtle, the action scenes laughable and poorly executed, and the screenplay disjointed and confusing, especially all the ridiculous back stories that keep disrupting the meager narrative flow. Technically the film is embarrassingly primitive, on par with early Edison and Lumiere brothers shorts. Except for the sound, the over-exposed color photography and the bell-bottom pants, think 1905, not 1975. Every film that is said to have inspired Sholay--Seven Samurai, Once Upon a Time in the West, The Great Train Robbery (1903), and even The Great Dictator (the character of the jailer is clearly lifted from Chaplin's classic spoof of Hitler)--is in every way superior to this three-and-a-half-hour monstrosity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The great "curry" version of a western is hardly a saga. The entire film wanders trying to define itself. Is it a comedy? Is it slapstick? Is it serious? A thriller? A cops and robbers? Or, is it a musical? Frankly, this film proves that it can't be all things and becomes a confused mass of people scrambling through cardboard settings in a slow developing plot burdened with sidetracks and one non sequitur after another. The stereotyped characters become caricatures of themselves as the plot slowly drags on. On the positive side, there are charming scenes of the Indian countryside and the actors seem to be having a good time. Also, there are many cultural puns which can explain its appeal to its Indian audience. However, to compare this montage of confused and confusing images with its muddle of traditional and western images to Sergio Leone's dark films is way off the mark.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, an utter lack of talent and vision meant that the best he could do was steal scenes from other films and string them into a cheap melodramatic hodge-podge.

Your typical East Indian move generally has all the plot under the sun, musical numbers aplenty and acting that is extremely laughable. Sholay! does this all about threefold. Yess, for 3 numbing hours, we see the tale of 2 lifelong friends trying to save one hick town from the evil guy (who admittedly, was very good) and while we arent getting flashback after flashback, get entertained by really wild Indian songs.
