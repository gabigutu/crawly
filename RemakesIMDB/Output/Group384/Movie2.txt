		<fullReview>I saw an interview of Mr. Amjad Khan for the video movie magazine "Lehren" back in the early 90's where Khansaab said he made this movie to close a certain chapter in his life.He said that creatively Sholay and in particular the character of Gabbar Singh had destroyed the careers of two people.One himself and Mr. Ramesh Sippy,director of the original Sholay even though they both had gone on to do different things.Khansaab mentioned movies like Shatranj key Khiladi,Chameli Ki Shaadi and Kalka for himself and Shakti,Saagar and the t.v serial Buniyaad for Mr. Sippy.So by making fun of Gabbar in this film he wanted to get back at Gabbar for hearing people say all his life to him and Mr. Sippy "key sir Sholay Wally baat nahin bani,Gabbar Wally baat nahin bani" Amazing huh!Still I love this movie.It's hilarious,very dated and Khansaab is just amazing like always.He was certainly one of those gifted people who made lots n lots of movies; some great,some not so great but never gave a bad performance himself.Here he spoofs his most iconic role till the hilt and it works.It's almost the same thing Mr. Bachchan is trying with Buddha Tera Baap."Humka laagat hai daal main kuch kaali hai""Ab bata daal main KYA KAALI HAI?"</fullReview>
