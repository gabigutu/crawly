		<fullReview>What on earth has become of our dear Ramu? Is this the same man who made Sarkar, Satya, and Comapny? I refuse to believe so. If AAG was Ramu's most ambitious project, he has clearly jumped off the high cliff he has ascended by giving the industry some of the greatest works of all times. This movie is made to fall like a brick. I was cringing to leave the theater, but I was forced to sit because I wouldn't have been able to take my car out of the parking lot before others also left. Else, nothing would have made me sit beyond interval.This movie is nowhere close to Sholay. It doesn't even come near it within a mile. I believe Ramu surely loves The Godfather more than Sholay, since Sarkar was a classic piece of work. I read Ramu's interview a couple of days back, in which the interviewer said that Ramu doesn't sleep for more than 4 hours a day, that too not at a stretch. I completely agree with this now, as his lack of sleep has probably taken its toll on the movie.There is no power in the performance. Amitabh Bachchan doesn't even look scary. He looked more terrifying in the few posters and wallpapers I saw earlier. Ramu's favorite Nisha Kothari did a fantastic job in Sarkar because she didn't have many dialogs (in fact none if I remember clearly). She opened her mouth in this movie, and has found a place in history. The new guy playing Jai's role seems to have that brash look, but didn't manage Jai's role at all. I cant go on... Im sorry... my pain is too big for me to manage right now.I promised myself throughout the movie that I will watch the original Sholay once more just to see that it is still there.Bottom Line: Horrible movie. The media and critics are going to cook Ramu's goose. And just to remind all readers once more, I am one of the biggest Ramu fans, and even I cant spare him for this act.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can this be?! The film has a character MORE annoying than Jar-Jar!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must tell you right up front, I am certainly NOT an authority on Bollywood films and have only seen a handful. However, if you've never seen one, DON'T start with this one! I have greatly enjoyed the ones I've seen up until this one, but I just couldn't stand this one. I also must tell you up front that I could not finish this film--it was that annoying. So why was it so annoying? 1. There is a character named 'Rambha' in the film. He is even more annoying than Jar-Jar Binks--which I never would have believed would have been possible. He is so #@^!# annoying!! He spoke in a falsetto voice and I think was meant to be comic relief. Instead, he just grated on my nerves and wanted him to die...slowly! His voice, his mannerisms and his obnoxiousness--he just didn't seem to shut up and dominated every scene he was in--and he needed to die! 2. The heroes had the amazing ability to dodge AK-47 bullets with ease. I kid you not--there was a scene where several unarmed guys took on a small army of guys with these assault rifles!! And, again and again, they avoided taking a single bullet AND beat up the ruffians!!! This made Stallone's actions in "Rambo II" look mundane!! 3. The film was so gosh-darn loud, in your face and intense--it practically made my brain bleed!! It was as if the film were made by people under the influence of meth!! Crazy camera angles, INTENSE music and action, action, action...this movie is clearly designed for someone who can't take a movie with plot and wants nearly 100% action.4. The two main characters and their actions and motivations made zero sense...none whatsoever! Perhaps if you are the most ardent action and Bollywood fan you can stand this film, but as for me I can see why it's on IMDb's infamous Bottom 100 list. Wow...this film is bad AND intensely bad!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How NOT to remake Sholay!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have seen the Sholay of 1975, Don't watch this movie. If you have NOT seen the Sholay of 1975, Go WATCH IT. But do not watch this movie. This movie has all the ingredients that could possibly have gone wrong with making a remake of Sholay. Amitabh 'Babban' Bachchan plays the role of a psycho villain to the best (Probably the only 40 mins of the reel that shouldn't be burnt). If you remove the rest of the movie and just watch amitabh play around with his character, it would still be worth a watch. But as Insp. Narsimha, Mohanlal doesn't do justice to his talent. Ajay Devgan(Heero) is extremely mundane and the only reason i think, they cast Prashant Raj in the role of Raj is because he has a striking resemblance to Amitabh of his young days. Sushmita Sen carries herself well, with grace and make-up. But the award for the "WORST performance and any role till date" must go to Nisha Kothari. She manages to degrade her acting to such levels that even high-school drama would would outshine her performance.If you have a mortal enemy, take him to this movie. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this a remake or a spoof?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's happening to RGV? He seems to repeat himself in every movie. Has he run out of creative ideas? If he has, time to take a back seat. Went to see the movie with great anticipation - of course not once did I imagine it would be anywhere near the original. I knew it wouldn't, the promos said it all. But even then I thought it would be a great RGV treat, after all isn't he the same guy who directed Sathya and Company? Or is he? I have my doubts after watching Aag. I am not going to talk about the plot or the story, as most of it is taken from the original, if you are really dying to go and see this one, you could play a fun game with friends: identify the scenes from the original one and give ratings of your own! So Veeru becomes Heero (how corny is that?), guess Heeru wouldn't sound that great. Ajay Devgan is quite a disaster as Heero, the comedy is strained and the slurred talk that really was effective in Company sounds fake. The chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo (Nisha Kothari) doesn't exists at all. In fact the more charming Nisha tries to be the more irritating she becomes. This reaches a peak by the end. Raj is in fact not bad as compared to the others, he is a guy to watch in the future. I was really disappointed with Amitabh Bachchan as Babban, he looks like a caricature of Gabbar Singh. There is a scene where he is drinking something from a bowl all covered in a shawl, instead of inspiring fear he looks like a beggar with his bowl. The only performance that really stood out was Mohan Lal as Inspector Narasimha. I am afraid I don't have the patience to write more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Something somewhere must have terribly gone wrong right at the time when the director was perceiving this plot. The movie, that was supposed to be the remake of one of the most loved movies in cinema, fails to deliver in every aspect of movie making. The best of the artists could also not pick up the tuning, that simply goes on to show that the movie in itself was a grave mistake.The editing is poor. Direction is crap. Acting is out of this world(omg)! The characters who are supposed to look scary force people to laugh on the stupidity of their dialogues and costumes.I wouldn't watch the movie even if someone paid me the cost of the tickets or even gave me a free burger with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ram Gopal Verma has proved himself as a very innovative and competent director. He had done a remake/reworking of Godfather with Sarkar, and succeeded tremendously. Ditto for Lolita which he made as Nishaabd.Sholay is been the movie he repeatedly says has inspired him the most. Unfortunately, he has managed to make a disappointing and ultimately boring remake.The acting ranged from decent to very good, with Amitabh Bachchan being suitably menacing as the villain Babban.The songs were awful and forgettable. The Mehbooba Mehbooba song came off as a second rate music video.The worst part was the pacing, and the dialogues - which were forgettable.Watching the movie in a theatre, I found myself waiting for the intermission, and then for the ending. Some viewers were wise not to wait, and were seen leaving throughout the duration of the film. Ultimately, one of the worst movies made by Ram Gopal Verma.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the scale went negative I would be happier. Seeing Sushmita Sen was nice, and Nisha Kothari has a bright future but the producer and the director ruined any and all enjoyment in this story. The choice of angles, choice of lighting and well everything distracted from trying to remember what is the story. Oh, if the songs and dances haven't caused you to rip your ears off your head, first. The film could have been made twice at 1.25 hours, and been pretty good, kinda like "Seven Samurai" but the director and writer didn't go that direction, even if the "townsfolk" finally find their backbone and want to help. This movie fails on so many levels: editing, writing, photography angles, style, lighting, script - name any aspect of this film - it was BAD - probably the food from the caterer was bad too. I have never in 6 years of watching Indian (Bollywood) movies seen something this badly made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Audience burnt alive in RAMGOPAL VARMA KI AAG</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OVERALL PERFORMANCE :- At last the long waiting AAG hits the screens. Unfortunately, it couldn't set progressive fire in the audience. The first best thing to talk about the movie is The idea of remaking the mighty SHOLAY. And Varma made a nice choice of changing the total backdrop of the movie. If he repeated the same Ramghad backdrop, people will again say there is nothing new in this. Different background is appreciative but the way he presented it is not worthy. Right from the start of his career with SIVA in Telugu, he had been using the same lighting and kind of background. I seriously dunno this guy Varma considers about lighting or not or may be he has no other lighting technique other than like gordon willis GODFATHER. It's all DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH. Why would some body use so many Dutch angles and extreme closeup shots!!!!!!! The shot division is lame. Characters couldn't carry an emotion, performances are not to their mark, Storytelling is worse, Background is really really terrible.Babban:- Amitabhz been over prioritized to his job. VARMA produced great villains like Bikumatre, Bhavtakur Das, Mallik Bhai but this time he failed in carving the all time best characters of Hindi Cinema. There's no comparison of Gabbar with Babban. Babban is a more psycho rather than a villain, still he has a soft corner for his brother ( It's a gift in this movie). Amitabhz performance is not to his mark. His appearance itself is pathetic. The scar on his nose, symbolizes forgotten villains of black and white cinema. What ever they worked on Babban is not successful. Babban is no comparison with Gabbar.Narsimha:- The first best thing about this character is not to put audience in suspense about his hands. If varma did that , it would be like teaching ABCD to a Bachelor degree holder. Itz good he opened the secret early. But the flashback is pathetic. Varma couldn't use a great actor like mohanlal to his mark.Durga:- The only character with betterment. This character has been improved with satisfactory changes and was used according to the story.Heroo, Raj, Ghunguroo:- No body bothers or at least considers these character. The utter failure of movie starts when director could not work on the close friendship between our heroz. These characters carry nothing to this movie.RAMGOPALVARMA:- His quality is degrading, diminishing. AAG totally can be treated as a C grade movie. Sholay is a fire of revenge, problem of a town, meaning for true friendship and highly appreciated nuisance and fun by Dharmendra. AAG never carried an emotion with its characters. Storytelling is too weak that it could not make audience feel sympathy for the characters. Don't compare AAG with sholay, still u will not like it.If you dare watch this movie. You will be burnt alive in RAMGOPAL VARMA KI AAG</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insult to Sholay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was absolutely...ugh i can't find the word oh wait... crap! I mean when it started i was like yeah this looks good and then after it was so boring. I nearly fell asleep and it had nothing to do with the fact that i caught a late showing because it was utter filth. Ram Gopal Varma has tried his best but the cast could never live up to the cast of the original Sholay i mean what was he thinking doing a remake. What was he trying to do? Be like Sanjay Leeli Bhansani and win all the awards next year like he did for Black? Ajay and that other guy were good especially the other guy who played raj because out of all of them he was the one to look at. What was Amitabh doing? He's destroying his own dignity by doing all these stupid films. First Nishabd then Cheeni Kum then Jhoom Barabar Jhoom and now this i mean hes got to gather a bit of his money and move as far away from Bollywood as possible before he loses all his respect and I'm telling you he's already past half his way. I mean all this is really good for the other actors like Shah Rukh Khan who's getting a really good name now because of the recent downfall of Amitabh. I never really liked him because he thinks he's God and i just knew Abhishek was going to be in that movie. If you want to save your ?17.75 and spend it on something good go watch Heyy Babyy because that's just the funniest movie ever and it's number one in the charts!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the worst remake ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, like many other Bachchan fans, having been eagerly awaiting the remake of Sholay. This movie was not it. Thank god they didn't let them use the name "Sholay" in the movie title. Ram Gopal's remake is not worthy of the title. The camera work, the locations, the costumes, the totally out-of-place dancing, the dialogue all combined to make the worst movie I have ever seen. You wonder if the cast of actors agreed to make this movie because they needed money and Ram Gopal was paying a lot of money for the cast. The only non-paid actor, the ant, was the only resemblance to the first movie. Abishek's role was totally ridiculous, did he need money to pay for the wedding to Ash? Save your money, your mind and your time, don't bother with this movie or the DVD when that comes out.</fullReview>

I'm a big fan of Ajay devgan (loved him in bhagat singh) but he is at his worst in this movie. amitabh seems to have worked hard for this one, but somehow the fear is missing. prashant raj is a non actor. and the most irritating part of the movie is nisha kothari. i have no clue why the director took her in this movie. the background score is repetitive. somehow i felt that ramu tried to repeat a sarkar, the color theme, the background score, the camera angles, but it didn't work.

To make matters worse it is given a 12A certificate so you do not see anyone getting shot, just bodies slumping to the ground, even Babban getting killed was cut out!!! Too many scenes were cut to bring in the younger viewers as I think the makers knew it would flop disastrously!! Amitabhs acting was great but that 'Basanti' wannabe and the other idiot who plays Devgans mate can't even act. Devgan was wasted!!I would not watch this for free again and I advise all others who read this to do just the same YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insult to the original classic and utter mockery of loved characters of Sholay.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all sorry for giving even a rating of 1 to this movie (nothing less than this available). The film fails in every department be it screenplay, direction, characterization or acting. 1) To start with, the name of the movie is really C class (though the movie itself match up to the name). 2) Amitabh Bachchan tries his best to live up to the character but the weak script coupled with pathetic direction ends up making him a humorous character. 3) In Sholay Gabbar Singh has reward of 50,000 on him (which was convincing). Here in Aag the figure was 100 crores for Babban (Amitabh Bachchan but poor man was beaten by our so called hero's and had only few men bikes to commute (with all automatic guns). Making a Sholay like movie in Mumbai type setup in modern time doesn't look convincing. 4) As for Nisha Kothari, somebody needs to tell her that she doesn't know acting. Why is Ram Gopal Verma casting her again and again ? 5) Mohanlal was good but there is hardly anything for him to do. 6) Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav who are great actors are wasted in the movie. 7) Legendry role played by Lila Misra (Mausi of Basanti) in Sholay is replaced cheaply in this movie by some Gangu Mummy. Ramu please grow up and understand that there needs to be some intellect in your movie. Enough of stupid characters in your movie like Shiva and Aag. 8) Should not say anything about modern Jai and Veeru..pathetic to the greatest extent.To summarize, I was shocked to see this movie because it looks like a cheap and comic translation of original classic. Please don't waste money and time on this movie. I think watching Aap Ka Surror (which I thought was the worst movie possible) would be a better idea than to see this horrible package of stupid characters, bad songs and miserable direction.Thanks, Saurabh</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For sure RGV also knew it that it wont work?.So what is next after another failure of RGV? AAG is so bad that it doesn't leave any space to speak a word . But still I'll attempt..:) Its not that remake doesn't work. (recent example is DON..It wasn't that bad. In fact personally I feel that it's an intelligent piece of work) but If the text/adaptation is so poor then no one can help.Here in AAG, RGV's cinematic language is his worst enemy ? Its high time for RGV to understand that his style is quite repetitive.. . His passion with dutch angle shots(tilted shots), fish-eye lenses, indoor studio setup, dark shades, close shots, jerky music?is not making any sense to anyone. His style is too loud that it dominates the text of the film and actors. The another problem with his loud treatment is that it doesn't play any role in narrative. At times it builds up a mood but most of the times one can feel that it's quite over imposed and plastic.AAG also suffers because of its great original sources like Seven Samurai, Sholay etc. I see the reason behind their success is their text and the treatment. External shots accessing the people's lives/spaces in these movies were missing in RGV's AAG. If RGV's SATYA could do the same then why not AAG? I am sure It could have been a good city-movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard core gangster Bollywood comedy confusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering the low score, I did not expect much from this movie, seeing it I was pleasantly surprised, at least for the first hour or so. It had all the elements you need for an at least watchable movie, a working plot, decent acting, a fair budget and so on. There were also a few fairly random song and dance numbers which I found kind of weird. But then I suppose that is part of the Bollywood aesthetic, I'm just not used to that kind of thing seeing as I've only ever seen a handful of Bollywood films. That said, there are some problems with the movie, chief among which is the confusion, caused by a number of different factors. For one, the plot is a bit disjointed with no clear flow or direction, but that is only minor. What is far worse is the cinematography, the camera keeps moving around like the cameraman was drunk, and when it stays in one place for any length of time it tends to be dark, with one bright source of light and lots of dust. It's hard to know what's going on, simply because you cannot see. Moreover the tone of the movie is very inconsistent; one moment we get some hard core gangster stuff full of torture and psychological terror, and the next we get comedy hi-jinks and over the top romance. The abrupt Bollywood dances contribute to this duality. I could stand with all this for a little while, say up to an hour and a half but when it turned out this thing is a whooping two and a half hours, it got too much. The story drags on forever and the director keeps cramming unnecessary stuff in, which only adds to the confusion. At normal length, with fewer sub-plots this would be a pretty good movie, all the problems put together drag it down to the low end of the scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Had a Déj? vu. A Bad One to Be Precise !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no un-remake-able movie. I mean yes, some classics are awe-inspiring; being too good to be true, let alone the history of you with them. But again and again, there are capable artists who can remake even the most memorable movies as super ones. The makers of (RGVKA) don't belong to this bunch of artists AT ALL. They don't even come near them within 1000 miles! This is a remake of one of the greatest Indian blockbusters ever (Sholay ? 1975) which was itself a remake of (The Seven Samurai ? 1954), yet a super remake. So, when you intent to remake, you have 2 choices : 1) do something better. Or 2) do something, at least, as good. Clearly it didn't do both. This movie impudently copies the honored, learned by heart, original the way any parrot does. It's really a classic when it comes to embody the detestable shot-by-shot transcribing, the very low remaking, and the stark-naked bankruptcy of the Indian cinema in the 2000s !Let's review the disaster; they thought that by casting (Amitabh Bachchan), one of the original's leads, as the evil man then they got a movie. They were wrong. So wrong. Because nothing was interesting enough, even seeing (Bachchan) himself! The character of (Babban) wasn't something special. Yes, (Bachchan) put some of the Amith magic to it, with tries to give it a bit of originality. But it's still idiot; yawning like a cat meaninglessly, talking in what sounds like great wisdom while all of his lines are so naive, eating in a restaurant while he's one of the most wanted and already a fugitive (!!),..etc. Speaking about originality, Bachchan was wearing the same outfit he wore in (Deewaar : Let's Bring Our Heroes Home) 3 years earlier (??). They gave him more screen time, cared about his own scenes but nothing made him surpass (Gabbar Singh) which was played by Amjad Khan (maybe the prototype of the violent evil man in the Indian cinema since the mid-1970s), or end my feeling about this movie as one of (Bachchan)'s smirches, else (Abhishek Bachchan)! So what's more laughable ? (Prashant Raj)'s haircut as so 70s? The performance of the actor who played the blind father? (Mohan Lal) who is too fat, and too frigid, to be that wounded policeman? Or (Abhishek Bachchan)'s cameo, presence, and his dubbed voice saying (Mahbobba, ahh, Mahbobba) ?!! No. It's the difference between the word (Sholay) and (Aag) since both mean Fire! There are plenty of laughable scenes where you must laugh at the movie not with it; the 2 leads attack some foes; who hold machine guns, with their bare hands and win (???), at the end the survivor lead hits nearly 5 foes, bigger than him and have machine guns, alone by just a short iron pipe !! Well, some people are just lucky (and I'm talking about the ones who didn't have to see this!). Watching the same comic scenes of the original repeating so lifelessly was pathetic; how to forget that hearing the same joke twice is a turn-off?!! (so how about hearing them by weak actors as well?!). This is what bad déj? vu stands for. It makes you ask ; why didn't they CREATE something for their own in these situations (simply why didn't they write a new movie for their own in the first place ?!!). However, they did things of their own indeed?Firstly they removed the song about the colors' festival to the inspector's flash back. How Original ! Secondly, they changed the names. But I read that due to director RGV's infringement of the trademark and copyright of G.P. Sippy (the first movie's producer) the Delhi High Court ordered this changing of names. So even this addition was done by a court's verdict?? Now How Scary ! And thirdly, the presence of the village was so trivial. Because this is not a western anymore, this is another usual, rather trite, action. And when the climax takes place in a huge deserted warehouse with a gang that ride motorcycles then it is close to Robocop more than anything !Director (Varma) had ebullient passion for Nisha Kothari's small sized butt. It was obvious (and boring) to see that so deliberately in every cadre she's in! The movie was one very poor, very dark video clip. The narrow, all indoor, locations were more than provocative since the movie is about a war. Furthermore, he shot nearly the whole thing from an inebriate's point of view, slanting and wobbling all the time, even at the serious parts!! And when the final result is this movie then you have to hate that the director very proudly put his name in the movie's title. That mirrors heavy megalomania. Actually, what's here, Mr. Varma, to be proud about to this extent ?!!!!!!!!Good points? Hmm.. Sushmita Sen for one. Nisha Kothari, by far, for another. The songs were OK. And believe it or not, the references to (Amar Akbar Anthony) and the slight, hardly noticeable, musical ones to (Sholay) were the best of this movie! It is another usual, rather trite, action, and with its statues as a remake of a great, WAS untouchable, movie then it's lamentable ! It utterly deserves being one of the biggest flops in Bollywood history. The difference between it and its original is the same between Pluto and the Sun! But save all the sad feelings, because I know that if the matters of one industry which produces 1100 movies yearly will still the same then we'll have (Amar Akbar Anthony : the remake) very soon. I just hope it'd be less bad! Finally, (Ajay Devgan) has a not handsome, not expressive and so silly face. This movie looks so much like him!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To paraphrase Anupam Kher after the much anticipated film "Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja" bombed big time "When a movie becomes hit, anything and everything about it is appreciative..... however when a movie sinks, you will see it laden with flaws". Sholay both old and new is the best example. There have been numerous attempts where classics have been touched (Devdas &amp; Don) and emerged victorious primarily because extra precaution was exercised. Even interpretations like Maqbool &amp; Omkaara (and Bergman's Romeo &amp; Juilet) were acknowledged and applauded. Wonder why RGV couldn't see it coming... Vinaash Kaale Vipreet Buddhi!A lot of has typing skills have been put to test so I won't go much that route. Every frame shouted "FOUL!" and yes, the only magical moments were when Big B appeared in the frame. He gave more than 100% but one swallow doesn't make a summer. Also it brings up a million dollar question: can Big B don the antagonist hat at all?In the process of construction of scenes, the emotional content has gone missing. For instance, why worry if Thakur shaves or not. In the first viewing these nuances doesn't matter. Only in repeat viewing, the human mind begins to play devil's advocate. To paraphrase Big B's lines from Silsila "Main Aur Meri Tanhai Aksar Yeh Baatein Karte Hain, Tum Hoti Toh Aisa Hota, Tum Hoti Toh Waisa Hota, Tum Is Baat Par Hansti, Us Baat Par Hairan Hoti....."The interpretation of Aag is on similar lines... "Yeh Hota Toh Kaisa Hota... Woh Hota Toh Kaisa Hota!!" IMO - Aag was a result brain-storming exercise with RGV playing chess on both sides.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Set Aag to Ram Gopal Varma's ki Aag..................</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot say that Aag is the worst Bollywood film ever made, because I haven't seen every Bollywood film, but my imagination tells me that it could well be.This film seems like an attempt at artistic suicide on behalf of the director, and I for one be believe he has been successful in his mission. No A-list actor outside of this film would risk sharing the same billing as him for all the humiliation this film is bound to carry with it.But lets not just blame the director here, there is the cinematographer, who looks like he's rehearsing for the amateur home movie maker of the year award. There is the over dramatic score, that hopes to carry you to the next scene. The lighting man, who must have been holding a cigarette in one hand and light bulb on pole in the other, and hoping that the flame burning off the cigarette would add to that much needed light in every scene. And, of course the actors! Some of them are by no means newcomers, else all could be forgiven here. The ensemble of actors in Aag were put together to promote a new beginning and dimension to the re-make of India's most loved movie of all time, 'Sholay'. One must not forget that these actors were not forced in to this film, they are A-list and willing participants to something that, let's face it would surely have had high and eager public expectation??? So it begs the question, Amitabh aside (for now), did the other actors really believe their performances even attempted to better the original? Did Amitabh Bachchan read the script and believe that people would remember his dialogue in this farcical abomination of a film? Don't be stupid, of course he didn't, this was a demonstration to the public of how much money talks hence can make actors walk.I truly hope everyone involved is satisfied with what is truly a vulgar attempt to remake a classic film, which only succeeds in polluting everyone's mind when they watch the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly shows that hype is not everything. Shows by and by what a crappy actor abhishek is and is only getting movies because of his dad and his wife. Amitabh as always is solid. Ajay Devgan as always is shitty and useless and the new guy is a joke. The leading lady is such a waste of an actor. Such pathetic movie from such a revered director and from such a big industry. With movies as such I have decreased the amount of bollywood movies I watch.RGV has been making very crappy movies for a while now. Time to get different actors. Hrithek anyone? Bollywood needs Madhuri and Kajol back. Every other leading lady is a half-naked wanna be. Pffffft.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RGK's Aag has a fatal flaw. It lacks emotional power in almost all the scenes and remains distant and detached.I was disappointed by Mohanlal.It is not the actors fault.Instead of the Arms being cut off,here it is his fingers being cut off.This was silly as it almost feels like cutting your nails.The murder of the whole family also lacked any emotions.RGK was interested only in his fetishistic camera angles.The final confrontation between Mohanlal and Bachhan was also a huge disappointment. In the original Sholay this was the jewel in the crown and you could ignore all the heroics of Amit and Dharmendra.In fact it was this bit of the story that was very original in the real Sholay.All the other dramatic moments were influenced by seven samurai and Once upon a time in the west.Overall, the actors performed adequately, but there was no chemistry between them. (Susmita Sen wins the award for best cardboard performance,and unlike other commentators I found Nisha Kothari to be tolerable and occasionally amusing).Audience is unlikely to get involved in any of the characters as they did with the original Sholay.RGK has tried not to copy Sholay and has to be congratulated in placing the story in a new context.Perhaps he tried to give a new twist to all the classic scenes so that he would not be accused of plagiarism.Apart from the single scene where Ajay Devgan teaches Nisha Kothari to shoot, I could not see any direct copy from sholay.All the rest are changed slightly, but significantly.I liked the idea of gunfight in Deevali night and on Holi.RGK tried to be original than a mere copy of Sholay-sort of a modern commentary.But in all these attempts he failed to bring drama and passion to the film and made it a lifeless and soulless experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sholay had great actors, great action, a great story filled with comedy, action, love, thrills, and suspense, great music, great songs, great dialogue, and was based on a real antagonist! It was and is a incredible masterpiece that rules Bollywood!Aag on the other hand is the complete opposite of all of that! Even the song 'Mehbooba' couldn't make up for it! I give it a 1 out of 10 for having guts to try to remaster the master! Also it has awkward camera angles, loud music with unclear dialog, scenes that make no sense, horrible action, horrible romance, horrible song usage, bad acting, and that's just the tip of the iceberg! If you were drunk and high at the same time, you still won't enjoy this movie. You can only watch it to torture yourself or someone else! It melts your brain and guts. Ram Gopal Verma even supported this movie as his baby! He made many promises, but all were broken! This was no where close to Sholay at all! Have a great day and DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ram Gopal Varma Ki Parody(read Sholay ki Parody)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As many comments have already stated this movie as a bad remake,i went to see to know how bad is it? ,and i found out that the comments (stating this movie as the worst of all remakes in Indian cinema) are true. First of all not being a die hard fan of the original i went to see the movie unbiased (not that i don't like Sholay but certainly don't agree with comments like that of Farah khan stating in a recent interview that the script of Sholay is the best ever script written in Indian cinema history and giving much of the credit of the commercial success of Sholay to its memorable and famous characters(Sambha,Gabbar etc),instead i think the characters became memorable and famous because of its great commercial success(which depicts the amount of people who have seen the movie) and there are many films which have better script than Sholay ,BUT as i said earlier Sholay is ONE OF THE BEST film made in India and thus should be treated respectfully.) Personally i feel the name of RGV's AAG should have been something like date movie or scary movie or "The mockery movie" because thats what he has done with this film ,he has made a mockery of himself and all the actors including Amitabh.The film is a scene by scene incarnation of Sholay with some slight variations from the original movie.The story is of a police inspector Narshihma who hires two local 'tapories'(Heero and Raj) to kill(or catch) a gangster Babban.The rest of the movie depicts how these two 'tapory' catch Babban. The movie is completely lifeless ,there is no Jai Veeru memorable 'dosti' ,there is no feeling whatsoever in the love story between Durga-Raj or Ghungroo-Heeru,there is no vengeance in the character of Narshihma,and most of all there is no spark in Baaban's role.it seams that the entire cast already knew during the shooting of the film that this would be a big flop and that's why everybody has performed way below their standard's, except Nisha Kothari who seems to have improved from her previous ventures but then too she is so irritating that i was pulling my hair half the time she was on screen.The actress don't even know which expression to give in a particular scene or song which is quiet eminent from all the songs in which she keeps mumbling something to herself (not in sync with lyrics) and then when camera focuses on her she gives a surprised look as though she just came to knew that a scene is being shot. Acting is poor Ajay imitating Dharmendra's style ,Nisha kothari looks irritated all the time ,it seems that she has constipation( at least her irritated looks suggest that),Baban seems to be suffering from asthma and his gang looks like the 'raamleela nautanki wala's'.Sushmita is too dull and often in conversation with Raj looks like his(Raj's) elder sister.The direction of the movie is poor as well and its disappointing to see a director who made a good(read acceptable) remake of The Godfather(Sarkar) making a movie like AAG.The songs are bad with no catchy number and very badly shot and with no lip sync in many songs with the lyrics ,which is usual in RGV's movie nowadays (even though its execution time is less it is very irritating).I would like to suggest Ramu to cast according to the character requirement rather than casting his favorites,and if he thinks of casting Nisha again please send her first to an acting school.RGV's AAG seems to be making fun of Sholay in its every scene. At last i want to suggest a new name for the film, what about RAM GOPAL VARMA KI PARODY!!!.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ramgopal Varma Ki Aag is his worst career decision ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't come up with appropriate enough words to describe the horror I felt sitting in that cinema watching Ramgopal Varma Ki Aag, the director's half-hearted attempt to pay tribute to that classic Bollywood western, Sholay. The biggest problem with Varma's remake is that he doesn't even try to make a credible film. It's evident in every single frame of this movie that Varma's heart is just not in it. What you see on screen is a bad joke at best, a gimmick on the part of the filmmaker, and it pains you to see what little regard he actually shows for a film he claims he's been a fan of all his life.I've seen several bad films over the years, but I can't remember one that's been as much of a torture to sit through as this one. Consider yourself very brave if you're able to survive the entire film, because it tests your patience like few films have before.Varma may borrow his plot and characters from the original film, but his version is trite and hollow and doesn't have any of the spirit and energy of Sholay. Ramgopal Varma Ki Aag is actually a mockery of that timeless gem because it turns out to be everything that the original film was not - way-over-the-top, too-long-too-boring, and entirely mindless. Much-loved moments from Sholay are parodied by Varma and for that you want to wring his neck. One of the most memorable scenes in Sholay in which Dharmendra as Veeru climbs up the watertank and threatens to jump down to his death is turned around in this film with Ajay Devgan playing Hero, pulling a pistol to his head threatening to shoot himself. How you wish he'd pulled the trigger and spared us all the agony.Not only does Ramgopal Varma Ki Aag fail as a remake of Sholay, it's a pretty bad effort even as a stand-alone film. The eardrum-damaging background score sounds more like someone clanging vessels in the kitchen, and the camera-work alternates between dramatic and head-spinning. Partners in this terrible crime of bringing this ridiculous film to screen are the film's mostly dead-as-wood actors. Sushmita Sen as Devi the widow takes both her role and the film too seriously, punctuating her lines with pauses, staring into camera for effect, and generally performing like her life depends upon it. Mohanlal as Narsimha, struggles with his Hindi dialogue and looks embarrassed to be delivering some of the stupidest lines in his illustrious career. Newcomer Prashant Raj playing Jai-equivalent Raj has no acting chops to speak of and can't strum up any of the brooding intensity Amitabh Bachchan brought to the part in the original film.As Hero, the new-age Veeru, Ajay Devgan is entirely hopeless, failing miserably in his attempts at comedy. But the film's weakest link, easily the most shocking casting decision is Nisha Kothari as Ghunghroo, who steps into the shoes of Hema Malini as Basanti, the endearing airhead from Sholay. Nisha Kothari is not only the worst actress in this country, but possibly the worst actress in this whole wide world, she gives the word annoying a whole new meaning, and she makes you want to slit your wrists every time she's on screen. And then, there is Amitabh Bachchan playing Babban Singh, Ramgopal Varma's version of Hindi cinema's most popular villain Gabbar Singh. The only actor in this ensemble who recognises the film's over-the-top tone and plays along accordingly, Bachchan constructs a menacing character who is a treat to watch. He's meant to be a comic book villain who snarls and sneers and hisses and hams, and he does all of that to good effect. But because he's trapped in such a doomed enterprise, his performance doesn't really help elevate the film in any way.No surprises here, I'm going with zero out of ten and two thumbs down for Ramgopal Varma Ki Aag, it one's of those painful movie-watching experiences you wouldn't subject even an enemy to. It's not like Varma hasn't handled a remake before. With Sarkar he gave us a smart, gripping take on The Godfather, and it's a pity he's made this Sholay bhature out of such a much-loved classic. Ramgopal Varma Ki Aag is his worst career decision ever, it's also a dark spot on his resume he'll be embarrassed of forever. I suspect this film will go down in movie history as Ramgopal Varma Ka Daag.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stale dish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once in a while in Indian cinema there comes along a movie like Sholay that changes the way the audience perceives a good movie. And den just once in a while(hopefully) we have a RGV ki Aag that breaks all the standards and creates one of its own. A standard so low, it can never be broken. Ram Gopal varma manages to take a melting pot of talent and create a dish so stale u can smell it from a distance. To take a classic like Sholay and assassinate it is totally unforgivable and I can't believe he almost called the movie RGV ki Sholay. Although Sholay had a lot of folklore elements in it, the movie managed to build on its plot by merely defining the characters so distinctively that they lived on forever. What Aag does is take these characters and mess them up so badly u'll need a contest to pick the worst. The realism element is totally missing and what the movie ends up providing is a bunch of "actors" parading along in a plot less and seemingly unrelated set of events. One star for this film is a ridiculous waste of a vote. its time for RGV to wake up to the reality of his failure and conjure up another "different" plot that can be categorized under cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iam a Big fan of Mr Ram Gopal Varma but i could not believe that he made this movie. i was really disappointed.Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag doesn't come anywhere close to the real Sholay. It does not leave a lasting impression on a viewer. Ram Gopal Varma fails to create chemistry between the characters . There is no camaraderie between Heero(Ajay Devgan) and Raj(Prashant raj). There are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame together. The sequence outside the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal face off is remarkable. Amitabh Bachchan should not have done this movie. Ajay and Sushmita sen was trying their best but no use. Rajpal Yadav's voice modulation - ineffective and rather pointless. Mohanlal did full justice and proved it again that acting is all about facial expression and body language. Rest of the cast was below expectation. The comedy situation which was adapted from the original sholay fall flat in this movie.Ram Gopal Varma could have worked upon the script but because of the controversies surrounded against the movie he messed up and just for the sake of making he made this Aag. But there is no fire.</fullReview>

Sholay, the old one is a milestone in Indian cinema with an all-star cast, cult dialogue, stylish cinematography and a brilliant soundtrack which is still a hit with present generations too.A good actor like Ajay Devgan's TALENTS ARE wasted and his performance was average.Prashant Raj, a newcomer doesn't know what acting is . Nisha Kothari proved she is one of the worst actresses we have I don't know how she is still in RGV's crew Urmila &amp; Abhishek seen in a song with no excitement and passion Mohanlal tried his best and Susmitha Sen's work was good i somehow liked her work in this movie It was a Total carnage of the original Sholay</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RGV ki jhaag- Sholay Remix.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a variant of Sholay , Ram Gopal Verma ventures into what can be called an unknown territory where the blockbuster takes a new shape. The Thakur goes south.Mohanlal as Narsimha the police inspector whose family has been killed seeks vengeance Madrasi style. The accent is totally South Indian in contrast to Thakur from the north. The severing of the hands of Thakur by Gabbar is also cut down to the fingers in Aag. So make up costs are cut down because there is no effort to hide the hands instead only a long shouldered Kurta covers up for the cut fingers. Moreso in the climax where the Thakur uses his legs and says"Tere Liye to mere paer hi kaafi hai" here Narsimha uses his finger stubs to fire a gun and kill the villain. Babban, the new avtar of gabbar is also different. He is not from Bihar or UP. He is Bambaiya. Gabbar's infamous laugh is also in two instalments this time and is more subdued. Babban asks for Diwali instead of Holi and romances Urmila the replacement of Helen in Mehbooba. he also dances and enjoys dancing with Abhisheh who plays Jalal Agha in Mehbooba.Babban is more intelligent this time. He tosses the apple and asks the question that made Isaac Newton discover laws of gravitation. Basanti is more verbose than the Auto driver Ghungroo. Nisha Kothari cannot play the auto driver and looks too artificial using words like 'entertain' and 'too much' with gay abandon. Viru was fun whereas Ajay Devgun is a misfit for the role. The God Speaks to Basanti incident and the shooting lessons and the Koi Haseena song and the water tank sequences are painful. The water tank turns into a well and the drunk Devgun is so bad in the sequence that the audience would have wanted him to commit suicide. Jai was composed and serious. Prashant Raj is better than the others because we do not expect anything from him. But he also bungles on the Mausi sequence. He is not as romantic as Jai with the mouth organ . Jaya's role played by Sushmita changes careers. A pure housewife turns into a doctor this time plunging into full time social service after her husband is killed. She too lacks the pain that Jaya displayed. Her flirtations with Jai are more open this time. Samba gets a bigger role this time as Tambe. He does not have to point guns and answer questions of Gabbar this time. He follows Babban wherever he goes and is a bodyguard with more visibility outside the den. Horses give way to Jeeps and auto. The Gabbar's hideout here keeps changing and Ramgarh becomes Kaliganj. All in all it is more of a spoof than anything else. RGV comes up with his own interpretation of the classic. But we remember the original so well even after three decades that our minds refuse to accept stylized versions and changed dialogues. So we call it a spoof. So Mr.RGV(Sholay ) and Farhan Akhtar (Don) and JPDutta(Umrao jaan) stop making remixes and start making originals.</fullReview>

There is no creativity on display in this venture. The fight scenes are incoherent and totally lacking in thrills or excitement. Amitabh Bachchan tries hard but fails to replicate Amjad Khan's legendary intensity. Ajay Devgun looks lost. Nisha Kothari's short movie career is probably over.

		<shortDescription>Wrong Kind of 'sholay'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie should not be watched as it was meant to be a flop. Ram Gopal Verma first wanted to make this a remake of classic bollywood movie "Sholay", but after having problems with the original makers decided to go ahead with the project and... i guess leave all the good parts of the movie (acting, script, songs, music, comedy, action etc) out and shoot the movie just because he already happen to hire the crew. Waste of money, waste of time. After making movies like Rangeela, Satya, and Company he pulled a Coppola (Godfather) on us; What were you thinking RGV? Anyways, the story is, though hard to follow, is almost like the Old sholay. Ajay Devgan playing Heero (Beeru, sholay) and Ajay, new kid on the block playing Ajay (Jay,sholay). Both "bad yet funny" friends help a cop capture a bad guy first. Later in the movie, now Retired cop hires them as personal security and safeguarding from the hands of a very most wanted Bubban played by Amitabh Bachan. In case you haven't been watching Bollywood movies, the Good guys win in the end. There I just saved you 3 precious hours of your life!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best possible remake (imaginable) of Sholay!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think people need to judge this movie a little differently from any other movie. We should judge it remembering that its a remake.What makes a good remake? I think a movie that gives you the flavor of the original with a new twist, would certify as a good remake attempt. That would make it a truly inspired movie as opposed to a copy of the original.An inspired movie as I said has the 'flavor' of the original but not necessarily the same content. Take for instance the song 'Mehbooba', it is not a Remix of the original! That takes some creativity. To generate the mood of the original song but create a different one. If you want to see a real (good) remix of 'Mehbooba', watch the Himesh Reshamiya movie.Another word to describe the remake quality of Aag is: Subtlety. For example, take the character of Jay. You get the feeling of of the original Jay but can't put your finger on the similarity right away. A more direct copy approach would have been to hire a true look-alike (Abhishek?).The other thing that RGV has done quite well is to present the story in a different context yet retain its believability. I think presenting the story in the context of the Mumbai underworld set in the modern times was a significant challenge in itself in which RGV again succeeds with flying colors.Overall look at it as RGV's tribute to the masterpiece and he certainly deserves respect for his attempt.So if you haven't seen it I would strongly recommend it and you might agree that it stands out as a good example of a truly inspired movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Retro+B movie from RGV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RGV's Aag is one of the advanced movies for it's released time coz it's made in a retro + B movies style. RGV deliberately gave that style to the movie. Unfortunately, the Indians are not ready for retro + B genre. He made this in that style because already lot of movies have been branded as remakes of sholey such as china gate(though it's a remake of seven samurai which again was an inspiration for sholey), mela....What do you think RGV who gave us films like Stays, COmpany, and Bhooth is such an idiot to make a B movie without his knowing? The answer is he made it deliberately with style i.e., RGV's stamp.Even the global audiences are not ready for this kinda movies coz the recent grindhouse was a flop though it could be enjoyed.So, what i want to say is that do not say sholey cannot be remade as the fact remains that it could be remade but it cannot be as big a hit as sholey was.Here, I hats off to RGV for giving us a fine piece of film making. As for the performances, i thing, every actor is superb in his own respect. Yes, Amitabh has given stellar performance but Mohan lal has given no less than a powerhouse performance. In fact, Mohan has given Amit run for his money.One more thing, Nish is so funny in the movie esp'lly with her Tapori accent and she has improved her acting skills. Come on guys, what do you expect from Aag, a classic. See the title which itself suggests its contents inside.Aur haan, this is not a biased review, just in case you think so. Honestly, I am a hardcore fan of RGV's, but still this is a genuine and careful review. ANd, I am not angry on anyone while writing is up.Keep making movies, RGV!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saved by Amitabh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not as bad as some are making it out to be, though obviously pathetic compared to the original. In my opinion Amitabh was great as the villain Babban Singh - try not to compare to Gabbar in the original as they were clearly not going for the same effect. Other than some mediocre action scenes however, the rest of the film is flawed. Character development was poor and the development of the story was hopeless, with many loopholes, and missing pieces of information which i wouldn't have known if i hadn't read the back of the DVD case. The worst part of the movie was the support roles from Nisha Kothari and especially this new dude called Prashant Raj. Nisha is just plain annoying from the time her lips first open. As for Prashant Raj - seriously who is this guy? where is he from and why on earth was he present in the film studio for anything other than to serve drinks?. His acting ability is zero and he has the same tone, dialog delivery and staunch expression in every scene, whether it be action, comedy, or even a scene when someone has just died. Ajay Devgan was average, at least his expressions changed which is more than i can say for his mistake of a companion. overall, RGV's Aag is worth watching for Amitabh's solid performance, and also a very sexy Urmilla Matondkar in a special appearance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't say this film as bad as people have been saying. Compared to other crappie bollywood love stories and comedies, I find this more entertaining. I don't think the Asian audience was ready for such an experimental film.No, We should not compare this with SHOOLEY.Yes, RGV kept the plot but approached the subject with sarcastic intentions.Camera work was pretty stylish, Editing was OK and acting...Big B deserves all the credits, he is excellent, it was interesting to watch a person who has been seen an idol to play a baddie. Ajay Devgan was cool and the rest, it could have been better...Word of mouth plays a big part in making a film successful and I think that's whats happened in this case AAG has not been given a fair chance, it has been plated with one bad comment after another</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ill give it an 8 out of 7 because of guts...RGV has the guts to make a remake of a 1975 classic bollywood film...Whatever you do, do NOT compare this film with the original..While the story is the same, the setting and everything is completely different.Either way RGV knows what he is doing...The first part of the film was great, but the second part could have used some improvement in the when it comes to execution...I have always said that RGV is one of the best film makers in India alongside Mahesh Bhatt, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, and Vishal Bharadwaj....From Shiva(1989), satya and company, to kaun, bhoot and sarker, RGV definitely knows what he is doing...There are many scenes in this film that stand out...Amitabhs intro (Babbans) was brilliantly executed...The acting could have also used some improvement...Amitabh and mohanlal were amazing but the rest of the cast was just OK...Ajay devgan was a miscast in my opinion..Instead Aamir Khan or even bobby deol would have been better. So basically, a decent flick (violent though), but it gets a 7 because of RGV's habit of taking a risk</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful movie that deserves more respect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike almost everybody else, I watched this movie months before I watched Sholay for the first time. And guess what? I enjoyed it, I even loved it! As a matter of fact, my opinion about Aag hasn't even changed at bit. I believe it's a remarkable, beautiful and well-made movie. Can you imagine how surprised I was to find this movie among the 30 worst movies ever? This, in my opinion, is one of the greatest injustices ever done to a movie.Surely, Sholay is one of the better old-school Bollywood movies. I can imagine people are attached to it, and that people who are will automatically believe any kind of remake is worse by definition. After all, the same thing goes when the movie is about a book one particularly cares for. And so, instead of watching the movie and enjoying it for what it is worth, one keeps waiting, comparing, and judging in a way that the movie in question is already doomed beforehand. Obviously, this is not the way to watch a movie. Instead, one should at least try to watch it as if it were the first movie one has ever seen in his entire life.Ram Gopal Varma is a master in building atmosphere, and in Aag he surely hasn't let us down. In spite of the script being very similar to that of Sholay, it is a completely different movie. Whereas the latter has - not incorrectly - been labeled a "massala Western", the atmosphere of Aag is predominantly dark. I absolutely love the character played by Amitabh Bachchan: Babban Singh. A terrific creation on his part, who has become one of my all-time favourite Bollywood villains.Yes, I admit it: I like RGV Ki Aag better than Sholay. Although Amjad Khan is great in the role of Gabbar Singh, Amitabh as Babban enchants me even more. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't change a single actor in Aag. While I agree that the duo Veeru/Jai is great, and more effective than the duo Heero/Raj, all the other Aag characters seem more appealing than their counterparts in Sholay. Notably the women: I honestly cannot see how Hema Malini (Basanti) and Jaya Bachchan (Radha) played their parts so much better than Nishi Kothari as the amusing tomboy Gunggroo and Sushmita Sen as the noble widow Devi. On the contrary, I find them plain irritating (Basanti) and completely uninteresting (Radha) at best, while the latter two really managed to make something new out of their parts. That is actually what I like best in Aag: although the story is essentially the same as in Sholay, both the setting and the characters are completely different from the original. It is, as it were, not just a remake, but also a complete reinterpretation. Another thing I absolutely love is the music. It is one of my favourite Bollywood soundtracks.To those who complain there is not enough romance and comedy in Aag (again, in comparison to Sholay), I would say: so much for the better! If you want those, try one out of many hundreds of other Bollywood movies. Aag has so much more to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad for a remake - expecting a resurrection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is seriously under-rared. I know that It has some serious blunders but the good part makes up for it. First the bad part: Ram Gopal Verma shouldn't have included any "comedy" scenes... they don't go with the rest of the film's look.The suicide scene was ridiculous. This guy, who made Company, comedy does NOT suit him. The moving hand held cameras were handled the ultra-moron way. Moving cameras can be used beautifully - see "The Bourne Supremacy". This guy, Amit Roy ruined it, I don't know, the guy who did well for Sarkar, what was he thinking? The frequent references to Al-Qaeda, America and Iraq were irritating. We'd've got what Babban meant even with out these comparisons.The goods are: Amithab's portrayal of Babban - very scary, sadistic, and freaky. Most criticisms of this are based on the character of Babban himself and not Amithab's acting and are therefore, hollow.Mohan lal.The disquietening affect of the shots - no wonder the guys around Babban are scared of him.The movie was not a scene by scene rip-off of the original Sholay.Once you get into the movie, you are absorbed into it. It is disquietening, it is disturbing - a photographic portrayal of the hierarchy of dominance</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Bad movie, but still not needed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you don't compare RGV Sholay to the the Sholay then you might like the movie it has its ups and downs.First half of the movie was quite interesting, the characters are well played by Ajay Devgan and Prashant Raj which was an OK surprice and specially Nisha Kothari who surprised me by her good acting, and she looked too good.Now to the main character in the movie Babban, Amitabh sure did live up to the Bad evil character, when you walk out of the cinema you will still remember him.Will the movie be remembered...I think not, its a one time movie and thats it. The second half of the movie was too slow paced and many places the emotion scenes were soul-less and boring.The Mehbooba song was made really good, and Urmila sure did look hot.RGV a good suggestion to you, don't make anymore remakes specially not the classics, I don't think your name as an Director will be criticized much cause You are not a great director.You made some good gangster movies but many flop Horror movies. You are and will always be an average Director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting beginning....alas! lacklustre ending!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who still think this movie is the remake of Sholay, its not. Its inspired by Sholay as Ram Gopal Verma was refused to do the remake by the Sholay filmmakers. The movie is good, period. Do not expect much and you might end up being pleased by it. To be frank, I went for this movie just to watch the Southindian legend, Mohanlal(who dons role similar to Sanjeev Kumar in Sholay). He did his job brilliantly but I must say hats off to Amitabh Bachchan. I've never seen a more scarier villain. I didn't see Sholay yet but I feel he surpassed the late Amjad Khan in sheer villainy. Also kudos to Ajay Devgan and new actor Prashanth Raj who essay with panache the roles similar to Dharmendra &amp; Amitabh respectively in Sholay. Sushmita Sen &amp; Nisha Kothari have also done their roles ample justice. What I didn't like, however, was the climax which could have been truly gripping. It ends quickly leaving us with a sour feeling. Dunno why RGV hurried up the end without giving us a genuine sense of thrill. But hey! the movie is still good. I would say - go for it for Amitabh Bachchan, Mohanlal, the fiery Urmila Matondkar(in Mehbooba song) or just plain curious on how Sholay could look like if remade in the year Mumbai 2007....</fullReview>
