		<fullReview>OK, so it's a cheesy remake of a camp classic.... But it is all good, harmless fun....Darryl Hannah stars as the titular character - a wealthy heiress who grows to 50 foot tall after she gets angry. After a freak encounter with aliens, she grows to an enormous size after an argument with her husband (Daniel Baldwin) and her father. It's a perfect remake of the 50's classic, updated to match the current 90's time frame - with big business and big bucks hanging in the balance.Some argue that another actress could have been cast as the lead, but Darryl was at the height of her popularity during the early 90s and is perfect in this role. Others argue that this b-rated made-for-cable release was a case of her slumming in her career. Either way, this stands as a cheesy remake of the camp b-movie classic... A definite afternoon cheezer pleaser...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very funny B flick. Tried a bit to hard to stay a B movie but a wonderful lark of hit you over the head metaphor of a woman "growing into her power". Ms Hanna was the right choice for this transformative awakening.I'd live in Nancy Archer's pocket any day!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ATTACK OF THE 50 FT. WOMAN (1993-MADE FOR CABLE TV) ** 1/2 Daryl Hannah, Daniel Baldwin, Cristi Conaway, William Windom, Frances Fisher, Paul Benedict. Special effects laden remake of the campy sci-fi classic about a troubled woman whose close encounter with a UFO transforms her into a giantess. Easily head and shoulders above its laughable predecessor, Hannah makes the most of her towering performance in a film that tries to mix feminism with kitsch. She gives Allison Hayes a run for her money in her behemoth bikini. Directed by comedian/"Spinal Tap" star Christopher Guest (too bad he didn't think of this as a vehicle for his wife Jamie Lee Curtis. Yowsa!!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course it is! This is the type of B-movie that you'll enjoy. I didn't expect to see HANNAH in this role. But it was fun in a corny kind of way. Although it is still the classic story just like the original, it is "made for tv." But thats okay because Hannah leads that "glamor blonde bombshell life" that her beauty stops the film from falling apart. (5)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT WOMAN (TV) (Christopher Guest, 1993) **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A smartly feminist reading of the 1958 camp classic is the basis of this made-for-TV remake which needlessly opens up the proceedings by adding some 25 minutes of &#x201c;character development&#x201d; &#x2013; which, basically, means new personalities who further traumatize or assist the distressed titular female. Daryl Hannah has trouble coping with the ugly duckling part of the story but grows nicely into her role once the gigantic transformation comes along and in which she is curiously but attractively decked out in cavewoman garb! Excepting the rather obnoxious Daniel Baldwin (as Hannah&#x2019;s philandering husband), the rest of the cast is capable enough: Frances Fisher is Hannah&#x2019;s helpful shrink, William Windom is her greedy tycoon father and, best of all, Cristi Conaway is Baldwin&#x2019;s sexy mistress who practically changes to a more outrageous wig with every new scene she&#x2019;s in; I knew nothing of her going in but, being sufficiently impressed I looked up her resume' on IMB and, what do you know, she was once married to an actor of presumably Maltese origins named Salvator Xuereb!! This is all well and good, perhaps, but I still wouldn&#x2019;t say that this is an improvement on the unjustly maligned original; for one thing, there are no giant aliens to be seen here and, worse still, the goofy fat deputy is (predictably, under the circumstances) replaced by a squeaky, tomboyish girl. The sheriff and his deputy are here depicted as being avid drive-in cinema-goers and, at one point, Hannah rips off the roof of a cinema which is screening the 1958 original! The new coda is also quite amusing: having been received inside the spaceship which caused her enormous growth, Hannah is joined by two other gigantic beauties who, sure enough, look upon their tiny hubbies as they go confessing to their various infidelities in interstellar group therapy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I get really amused by the reviews from people who think this is a serious film - please grow up, people!A real tongue in cheek remake of a 50's B Movie, the sort of thing Rodrigues and Tarantino did later with Planet Terror, but this was WAY before that. Wonderful one liners and parodies of the fifties, loved the catering wagon with "Arkoff &amp; Corman" on the side, a great tribute to the masters of the 50's B Movie genre. Loved it, Daryl Hannah is wonderful but so are the whole cast,the sleazy husband, uncaring father and the beautician mistress with the interchangeable hair ( a different wig in every scene) are classic characters you'll recognise immediately. looks like they really had fun making this. Well worth your time, don't forget the popcorn!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hannah classic, which is lost in the wilderness!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Kill Bill was released, the cult icon and movie goddess label was not only attached to the gorgeous Uma Thurman but also her equally beautiful co-star Daryl Hannah. Having been off the Hollywood radar for some years, Hannah suddenly had everyone remembering just why she made such a big splash with Tom Hanks way back in 1984. In between Daryl had made some interesting movies, some more memorable than others. But for every high profile movie like Wall Street there was a Crazy People, for every Roxanne, there was a Grump Old Man. But Daryl kept on and in the wilderness years she made a movie that shouts out to the viewer by the title alone. Attack of the 50ft Woman tells the story of Nancy Archer, a woman who is constantly chasing after her philandering husband. One night, after finding him once more at a motel, she drives off into the night on a deserted road. But then a UFO appears and hits her with a light. When she tells people of her experience, no-one believes her, least of all her cheating husband, who hopes she might now be declared legally insane, or her father, who only loves her because of her stake in the family business. But soon something strange happens to Nancy, as she gets more angry she starts to grow. Soon she is fifty foot tall, and while she is physically huge, her patience is thin, especially with her cheating husband, and her money grabbing father? Attack of the 50ft Woman is a comedy that is straight from the handbook of 1950s sci-fi movies, with back projection and dialogue that feels totally from that spaced out genre. The performance by Daryl as the ever growing Nancy is well played, her attractiveness is not just in looks, you really do fall for her charms, even if her dumb husband can't. That "dumb husband" played by Daniel Baldwin, does well in what is a one dimensional role, the guy is a creep and he's never going to learn his lesson. Meanwhile even Frances Fisher appears as the local shrink, while William Windom is all high and mighty as Nancy's father whose only interest in life is the interest he's making at the bank. This movie is probably forever left in the archives of forgotten video, or, like General Zod and his companions in Superman, left to be locked away forever and drift endlessly in space. Only the galaxy I found a copy in was a place called e Bay. And when I played it I found a movie that is worthy due to the lovely Daryl, and the concept of a woman rising above her bullying men and teaching them manners the hard way. Attack of the 50ft Woman deserves to be seen, rent it, buy it, or just record of the TV. But do watch it, because you don't want to make Hannah mad?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very funny and deliberately campy remake of the 50's schlock classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beautiful and wealthy, but meek and unhappy Nancy Archer (a fine and appealing performance by Daryl Hannah) becomes more assertive and self-assured after an encounter with a UFO causes her to grow fifty feet tall. However, her unfaithful conniving husband Harry (a nicely sleazy portrayal by Daniel Baldwin) tries to have Nancy committed to an asylum so he can collect her sizable fortune. Director Christopher Guest, working from a sharp and witty script by Joseph Dougherty, maintains a snappy pace and an engaging tongue-in-cheek tone while putting a knowing 90's feminist female empowerment spin on the material: Nancy gets more gutsy and confidant due to her increased size, thereby encouraging herself and other distaff characters to surmount the smarmy male oppression around them. Moreover, it's acted with zest by a spirited cast: William Windom as Nancy's domineering tycoon father Hamilton Camp, Frances Fisher as helpful therapist Dr. Theodora Cushing, Cristi Conway as Harry's sexy'n'sassy beautician paramour Louise "Honey" Parker, Paul Benedict as the pompous Dr. Victor Loeb, O'Neal Compton as the amiable Sheriff Denby, and Victoria Hass as spunky tomboy Deputy Charlotte "Charlie" Spooner. The rather rinky-dink (not so) special effects possess a certain tacky charm. The obvious cheesy outdoor sets likewise have an endearing artificial look to them. Both Nicholas Pike's spacey score and Russell Carpenter's bright cinematography are up to par. A cute diversion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there was a Top-ten of movies that are hidden gems, this movie ought to be on this. Really, what do you expect from a movie about a giant woman. Fun surely and a good laugh because you will think that there are really people who have time and money to waste! Nevertheless, I find this movie as an actual brilliant call for feminism. It's subtle but the message is clearly heard and that's good when movies help to make a better world.Take the giant woman: why is she so tall? For the idiots, it's because aliens have abducted her. For others, her height is the necessary sign to end male superiority and advance women rights.Why do you have the usual babe? For the sex addicts, it's because sex sells and it's true that the babe is sexy. But she studies and wants to build her own life and shows the world that you can trust a woman! And we can add the police woman who is also asserting herself against man values! With this light movie, it's an interesting way to catch the attention of anyone and it would be a wrong choice to make exclusive social arguments only to intellectual (and often dull) movies.In addition, the movie is a great artistic work: with his bad frame, not bright colors, you really think you watch a movie that has been shot in the fifties. This feeling is actually well played because you can find as many modern objects (the copters) than 50's ones (the police car). The beginning of the movie with his two introductions recalls me the exact mood of those old science fiction movies I watched in my childhoods ("Ants", "The Fly").As it is science fiction, it must also pass the test of the special effects and I think they are brilliant. The minimized stages are well crafted and don't look like puppets houses.Last words about the cast to conclude this review: The women are great and Daryl Hannah has always this kind softness about her. The Baldwinn brother is perfect because he looks and acts very like his brothers, that is to say big heads you want to slap!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original; I can imagine that it isn't as feminist as, or at least less overtly so than, this. Guest gets the tone, and this largely delivers what it promises. I know he can direct something hilarious, since I've seen Best in Show; this doesn't have the benefits of a cast full of proved comedic talent, and the writing is inferior, though not without chuckle-inducing moments. There are a couple of lines that are downright quotable. You probably know the plot already; Daniel Baldwin, a bastard merely by virtue of the fact that he's cheating on Darryl Hannah(even if the squeeze he found is also a sight for sore eyes), and several others (all male) talk down to her, and once she begins to grow in size, she attempts to exact vengeance upon them. The FX are cheesy, dated and obvious, and I would wager this was an intentional decision. This is both a spoof and an homage. There is brief suspense. The characters and acting aren't half bad. There is some sexuality(and eye-candy) and brief nudity in this. The DVD comes with a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to fans of the concept. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I imported this one through a greedy shark that took quite a chunk out of me, but Darryl Hannah's beauty was worth the bite. I've wanted to see this ever since 1993, but the movie just never came my way. Harry sure was a loathsome idiot for neglecting his pretty wife that way. Hell, the guy had everything going for him, but still he wasn't satisfied. Oh, and she is just so huggable! That tall, elegant, warm-hearted slice of loveliness that he had to discard for brash Honey. She grows up spectacularly, and the stable and swimming pool scenes are especially good, although the downtown scenes with the 'houses' are kinda lame, but what I would like to know is where she got that dress? A circus tent? I really got worried that she was going to go the way ol' KING KONG did three times before her, but the ending took a different turn that falls far from satisfactory, a more here on Earth resolution was necessary, with everybody getting their just desserts in more conventional fashion, but okay, this is an unconventional movie.It's just, well, a movie should show its main protagonist to be so much better than the competition, and if the point was, during the Fifties, the man is so domineering, or aggressive, because of his size, let's reverse this, there really is no need for this with Nineties hindsight, yet Nancy becomes violent at the slightest provocation after her growth spurt. She used to keep herself in check; what happened to this discipline too readily thrown out? The moral of the story should have been that after the shift in power, she should have remained the better person, instead of simply playing to another stereotype. Brain power, there lies the answer. She is clearly smart, and this should have been her real Attack, her size just an ally lending her confidence. Her exposition of her father and husband's multiple wrongdoings should have brought much more discredit to the characters than were the case, and this would have been the climax of the movie, rather than these giantesses wielding threats flying around in a UFO. She also should have been returned to normal, and found a decent partner, somebody who truly loved her.The best thing about this movie? Darryl Hannah all the way! There was a surprising nude scene, however brief, involving Christi (Honey), but nothing detracts from the lead actress, the SPLASH mermaid superstar!Except maybe a weak, very much flawed script...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Movie but it has one hilarious line Contains Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Except for the segments that featured the nearly buck naked Hanna as the 50 foot woman the movie was far worse than the original 1958 classic. The special effects were solid and the miniature sets convincing but that's about it for this turkey. What made most of the movie tiresome was the feminist message of 'women growing in power'. The message was delivered persistently and eventually became quite obnoxious. It was as though the filmmakers wanted to take the movie to a higher plane by attaching a heavy message to it. They failed in that quest but in the process managed to take much of the fun out of the movie. Obviously the movie is based on an absurd concept, but that's alright, it is SciFi after all. The film makers should have accepted the fact that the story was a simple, "Hell has no fury like a woman scorned' thing and had fun with it.The 1958 version became a classic only because Allison Hayes was such a bombshell and looked so good in the slow motion low angle shots. Hannah is also a bombshell and the remake could have enjoyed a similar induction into the cult classic club if they had dumped the dumb feminist message. I imagine the movie could be re-cut to weed out the Fem-Nazi chaff but would it really be worth the effort? Lastly, what was with the timid ending? The original had the enraged giantess crushing her cheating little husband to death in her hand and getting electrocuted soon after. The 1994 remake had the 50 footer getting zapped by 50,000 volts and then being transported aboard a feminist star ship and reanimated along with her naughty husband. Instead of being crushed by his pissed off wife for his indiscretions and betrayals the guy is confined to a fish tank that serves the all giantess starship crew as a male chauvinist pig reeducation center. I guess it was supposed to be funny but it was simply tiresome.There were however a few good lines in the movie but they are few and far between. The best line in the movie was delivered by Baldwin when the stunning but grotesquely over sized Nancy Archer suggests some sexual 'possibilities' during her attempt to seduce her wayward husband.Nancy Archer, "Think of it Harry, Love on the scale of Gulliver."Harry Archer, "You are crazy! What do you expect me to do, get a wetsuit and a flashlight?"Now that's funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HBO Films produces some of the finest made for TV films ever made but that view can not apply for this 1993 release starring Daryl Hannah in the title role originally portrayed by Allison Hayes in a 1958 drive in theater cult classic of the same name. The story about an abused housewife (Hannah) whose close encounter with an UFO causes her to become a giant is something that should not have been tackled by HBO Films. Fortunately, Hannah followed up this dreadful lead with a good supporting part in the theatrical hit film "Grumpy Old Men."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intentionally "Tacky" Remake:"Gulliver Meets Sea Hunt"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rich and spoiled woman (Daryl Hannah)) is "zapped" with a ray from a flying saucer. Nobody believes her until she pops out of her clothes to over 50 feet tall. She lives in a big barn and sews her own clothes. (How very convenient.) Unlike "The Hulk" no purple stretchy underwear. It tries to be "campy" just like the 1950's film and somewhat succeeds. Nobody dies in this remake. Fake blue backdrop and jet-black studio skies. Daryl Hannah makes it into a woman's lib parody. When she grows to her full size she "attacks" her husband's lover, but only verbally. "You are better than this and smarter than all the men in town" (paraphrased) The sets (intentionally) look cheap like model-train miniature buildings. She stomps through town and everyone screams. She and her husband are picked up by the flying saucer, so nobody believes she is crazy anymore. Borrows from the original. Missiles are fired at her, she falls into the high-voltage electric wires, but does not die. Several silly things in the movie: Giant trucks deliver "Summer's Eve Deodorant for Women" and Revlon products. The doctor tries to give her a giant-sized hypo-tranquilizer. She suggests that her normal-sized man "can keep her happy"? He remarks: "What am I supposed to do? put on a "wet-suit" and bring a flashlight"? The love "gyrations" are poorly done and not provocative. Baldwin looks like he is drilling for oil! Daryl hitches a saucer-ride to the stars with two pretty giant alien "twins". Everyone is 50 ft. tall! They pick up three Earth-men, including her husband. They are still normal-sized at this time. They are all wearing yellow Capt. Kirk polo shirts, of course. It's a guilty-pleasure film due to pretty Ms. Hannah wearing practically nothing at times. Also minor nudity (cheeky). Cute but not that funny or scary. The drive-in she smashes is showing the old b/w 1950's version of the same movie. Yes, she did make a few better movies. "Splash" and "Roxanne" with Steve Martin, both come to mind. I rate it PG-13 (or a weak "R"). Minor violence, suggestive language, and brief nudity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as fun as it sounds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version of "Attack of the 50 foot Woman" isn't as much fun as the title may suggest. The main problem is that the film can't make up its mind on what it wants to be. Is it a spoof/homage to the cheesy 50's giant monster horror movies, or is a serious, but bizarre fantasy-drama about a woman who needs to break out of her shell? I know this sounds absolutely baffling, but the film actually kind of works as a quirky drama. We've got this woman who is suddenly 50 feet tall and has more than enough power to stand up to the men that would objectify and abuse her. Mixed in with that we have some standard giant monster stuff that feels really out of place, and this is coming from a big fan of Kaiju/giant monster movies. If the film had picked either direction and stuck with it, this could have been a very entertaining film but instead the audience is left disappointed. I found that technically the movie is pretty good, with some convincing special effects (well, for the most part; overall they are still convincing) and it features a good cast. How or when you're going to watch this, I really don't know because this is neither a "so bad it's good" cheesy horror flick you can laugh at and it isn't a clever twist on the films that inspired it either. I mistook this version for the original "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman" when I bought the VHS tape. Sure it only cost me a buck but I was still disappointed. (On VHS, September 21, 2012)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Just Don't Get Postmodernism, Do You?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend of mine once said that "a happy wife may have the best husband, but more often makes the best of the husband she has". Nancy Archer, the main character in this film, is another wife struggling to make the best of a bad job. She's just not a happy one. Her husband, Harry, is frequently unfaithful to her, but she tries hard to convince herself that she still loves him and that, in spite of appearances, he really still loves her. Nancy's problems don't end with Harry. She is an heiress who has inherited considerable wealth from her mother, but her father, Hamilton Cobb, a ruthless and ambitious property speculator, bullies her into allowing him to use the money to fund his business ventures. Nancy's one source of comfort is her psychiatrist, Dr. Cushing, whom she sees frequently. And then, following an encounter with a UFO one night, Nancy finds herself growing to gigantic size, not stopping until she is 50 feet tall. She realises that her new height, and corresponding strength, have given her the opportunity to get even with her father and Harry. When I recently reviewed "Roxanne", also starring&nbsp;Daryl Hannah, I pointed out that, although she was regarded as one of Hollywood's rising stars of the eighties, her career seemed to go into something of a decline and few of her films from this century, apart from the two "Kill Bill" episodes, have aroused much attention. Part of the reason may have been Hollywood has had something of a surplus of lookalike leggy blondes in the last two or three decades (Kim Basinger, Uma Thurman, Cameron Diaz, Gwyneth Paltrow, etc.), but another part of the reason may have been too many films like this one. Actually, Daryl's performance here is not a particularly bad one, and she makes Nancy into a rather sweet and lovable heroine. My problem was that I just couldn't see why the film was made in the first place. The original 1958 version of "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman"&nbsp;is frequently described as a "cult movie". Now this expression sometimes means "unjustly neglected masterpiece", or at least "a film&nbsp;regarded by its cultists, if by nobody else, as an unjustly neglected masterpiece", but in the context of low-budget fifties sci-fi it generally means "complete rubbish which some people enjoy watching for the pleasure of sniggering at how bad it is". Indeed, "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman" is sometimes listed among the "worst films ever made", although in my opinion it cannot really compete with the true classics of that particular genre such as "Plan 9 from Outer Space". It's bad, certainly, but not quite that bad. So why on earth would anyone want to remake it? Possibly because of its very reputation for badness. After all, devotees of cult movies of this variety frequently claim to watch them in a spirit of postmodern ironic detachment, and so if accused of making a bad movie the film-makers will always have a retort handy. "But it's not a bad movie! It's an ironic movie! You just don't get postmodernism, do you?"Unfortunately, to paraphrase Edith Cavell, irony is not enough. The 1993 film does not really add anything to its less-than-illustrious predecessor. Certainly, the art of special effects had advanced during the intervening three and a half decades, so this aspect of the film is certainly better than in the original, but that's only "better" in the sense that "mediocre" is better than "embarrassingly bad". The remake's one indisputably new feature is that it adds a heavy-handed feminist message along the lines of "men are all bastards". It is notable that at the end Nancy takes revenge in full on her husband and father while Harry's mistress Honey is forgiven. (Yeah, she might have played her part in breaking up Nancy's marriage, but as a woman she is automatically counted as part of the "sisterhood"). Part of the incongruity of the original was the way in which it combined a domestic melodrama about a cheating husband with a science-fiction theme and did so in a completely straight-laced, humourless way. People may have laughed at the original; they didn't laugh with it. One way of remaking it, therefore, would have been to do so as a comedy which attempted to get laughs out of this incongruity, but the remake never achieves this. It may&nbsp;have been made in an ironic, tongue-in-cheek spirit, but "tongue-in-cheek" does not always equate to "funny". It's not an ironic movie. It's just a bad movie. I just don't get postmodernism, do I? 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Failed Attempt at a Campy Parody of the 1950s Horror Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Attack of the 50 foot Woman" was intended as a parody of the 1958 cult classic and in the beginning it does succeed on that level. Dr. Victor Loeb (Paul Benedict) tells his audience, "Everything that you are about to see is true," even though it is hard to imagine someone having the foresight to film the entire unabridged life story of the 50 foot woman, Nancy Archer (Daryl Hannah), including shots of her cheating husband Harry Archer (Daniel Baldwin).But then from the moment that we see Nancy Archer driving down the highway with her car, this movie falls apart. There are gags, but the gags get old and tired very quickly. Daniel Baldwin as mean-spirited, promiscuous husband Harry Archer is funny in a couple of scenes, but annoying in others. Daniel Baldwin gives a single note performance throughout this film long after we figured out what the single note is. Similarly when we see the same eight people running up and down the same street to escape the fifty foot woman, one realizes that it was meant to be funny, but it is just not funny because that kind of parody lacks the wit to work. It is just mind-numbingly basic. The same could be said of scenes with the two policeman - one fat and one skinny, like all 1950s policemen in the movies - which are frankly just boring to watch, rather than funny (which I think was the point of devoting feel reel to showing them).In conclusion, it may be possible to make a film parodying the 1950s horror genre, but it seems to me that the director, writers and producers did not even try to make this film work. They seem to have assumed that all they had to do was throw into a flying saucer, a fifty foot woman, some fake footage of a town, a mean husband, and two boring police officers and they had the makings of a campy comedy. But they are wrong. "Attack of the 50 foot woman" is a primary example of the screenplay simply not being ready for production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am no fan of the original 1958 movie. It was half hazard and clumsy at best. But this 1993 made for TV remake directed by Christopher Guest was funny on purpose. It has a great cast including William Windom as her scheming Father who is best known as Commadore Decker in the original Star Trek and Seth the cranky country doctor in Murder, She Wrote. He does a bang up job in this funny and well made remake. The effects are 100 times better then the original and if I had to make a choice, I'd watch this version over the old turkey any day of the week. This is the only classic when it comes to the fifty foot woman. Plus, there is a great twist at the end which I will not give away, you will have to see it for yourself. But I will say this, it gives motive to why the aliens made her grow in the first place, something the original never said. I give ATTACK OF THE 50 FT. WOMAN, 8 STARS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The irony of this remake is that it looks even cheaper and tackier than the B-movie original. The cheesiness seems deliberate at first, but the rubbishy scenes with Daryl Hannah walking through a model town picking up toy cars make it hard to believe that anyone would make a film this lame on purpose - and if they did, what's the point? The first half is fairly enjoyable, thanks to some fun gags and the performances of William Windom as Hannah's overbearing father and O'Neal Compton as the local sheriff; but once the point has been made that growing to a massive size is Hannah's way to dominate both her dad and cheating husband, the movie has nowhere to go and interest quickly fizzles out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I didn't got the idea behind this remake of the 1958 classic but I found it a pure waist of time. It all looked very cheap, maybe it was intended but for me it didn't work. If you are remaking a flick then I suppose that you add something new towards it but by just using the same cheap effects for me it's a pity that it was made.The acting was also a bit exaggerated just like in the fifties but I just couldn't get into the characters. The main lead by Daryll Hannah was okay and she moved further to play in Kill Bill 1 and 2 and is supposed to return in part 3. Daniel Baldwin couldn't convince me at all but then again, so many failed in this flick. It's girl galore because Cristi Conaway was good too.But it is really so slow, too much of talking and nothing really happens until the last 15 minutes. I'm not digging flicks from the fifties but if you remake them the same way as then then I leave it as it is. Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 1/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 1/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre remake of a mediocre movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it is an amusing movie and a good way to "waste" a couple hours. The plot is outdated and the acting quality is right out of the 1950s, hasn't changed a bit, however, you have to give it credit, after all, what do you expect out of a movie with the title Attack of the 50 ft. Woman, by the way, they can't even get that one right, if you look at her while she's standing next to certain objects, you can see she's over 100 feet rather than 50 feet. This is a movie to see only once. If you are a fan of the 50's movies, or if you don't mind movies with silly plots and bad acting, you'll enjoy this one, otherwise, steer clear of this one by all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pitiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1993 TV movie is a remake of a classic, campy bit of '50s sci-fi cinema and it's an absolute dog of a film. Perhaps understandably, the makes of this pitiful nonsense have gone for a comic, equally campy approach because there's no way the elements of this movie could ever be taken seriously, comedy or otherwise.ATTACK OF THE 50 FT. WOMAN is a film filled with horrible actors reading from a horrible script. It's diabolically bad, the script is puerile and at times it gets so bad that I actually felt embarrassed for those involved. Yes, this stuff could pass muster in the long-gone 1950s, but not in the early '90s when TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY had revolutionised the sci-fi genre just two years previously.Daryl Hannah lives up to her blonde bimbo reputation as the titular character, who doesn't even grow until an inordinate time of boring small-talk and excruciating attempts at character development have taken place. Meanwhile, the Baldwin clan have a reputation for playing sleazy, slimy and obnoxious characters and sibling Daniel takes the biscuit with his adulterous husband here - a character who's literally oozing grease and stupidity.The special effects are poor, and only appear "special" in a couple of scenes in the whole movie, and the sight of a wobbly, poorly-animated UFO is the barrel-scraping nadir, really. The idea of a scorned wife grown to gigantic proportions and wreaking havoc on an unsuspecting town in search of her slimeball husband is an outlandish one and something you think would be difficult to mess up; there's the spectacle if nothing else, but everything about this movie is screwed up in the worst way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie its not good. The hole idea of a superbigwomen is stupid. The actor is at its most doing there job and not more. They really don't have much to work with, Daryl Hannah looks god but that's it. One keeps thinking why anyone would do a remake of a film that was not good in the first place. The 1993 version did not add anything to the 1958 version.The special effects are lousy. Probably they couldn't do better than this 20 years ago but that's makes it only looks cheesy today. Another thing that's strikes me is that the movie is extremely slow. Not very much happens. Sometimes the director tries to be funny. I wish he hadn't. The jokes fell flat to the ground.All in all the movie is not awful but not good either. Its rather boring and I could not recommend this to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're going to be a young woman who is made 50 feet tall in an isolated incident with a UFO in the desert, you might as well be Darryl Hannah. She's tall to begin with but she'd look fine at any altitude. She's enough to make any normal man want to climb up her calf and bite and squeeze her but that normal man shouldn't take the fantasy too far. She does have a good deal of heft, after all, and you wouldn't want her to roll over in the middle of the night.Enough of Darryl Hannah's lustrous blond beauty and incomparable figure. The movie -- yes, the movie. First of all, I have to mention J. B. S. Haldane's observation that Darryl Hannah might do fine at five or six feet but not at fifty. It isn't that she'd always have her head in the clouds despite her feet being on the ground. And let's not have any cracks about "How's the weather up there?" What do you think this is, a gag? Haldane calculated that a human being was "just the right size." Because if he were bigger he'd weigh too much and the bones of his legs wouldn't support that weight. He'd collapse because his legs would break off. He -- or she, in this instance -- would wind up like Ozymandias in Shelley's poem, which I'll take the liberty of quoting here.I met a traveller from an antique land, Who said -- "two vast and trunkless legs of stone Stand in the desert ... near them, on the sand, Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown, And wrinkled lips, and sneer of cold command, Tell that its sculptor well those passions read Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed; And on the pedestal these words appear: My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings, Look on my Works ye Mighty, and despair! Nothing beside remains. Round the decay Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away." --Okay, okay. That's off topic. Don't bother saying it. You don't need to draw ME a picture. But the movie doesn't forget where it's going. It follows its compass straight towards women's lib. Hannah, a weak-willed rich lady, is put upon and brow beaten by everyone she comes in contact with except her shrink, Frances Fisher. The men are especially brutal, even her Dad. Her philandering husband, one of the Baldwin brothers, is suitably slimy but nobody really turns in a good performance. Hannah herself seems languid to the point of sleepiness. I didn't make it to the end but I imagine she gets even with all those patriarchal pigs. The director, Christopher Guest, shoots it straight but must have known, in his heart of hearts, that it was to laugh at. I hope so, for his sake, because, if taken seriously, the movie has all the dash and relevance of a recipe for plain spaghetti sauce.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laclustre sci-fi cheese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of a film I have never seen so it's impossible to compare but I guess it was commissioned back in the early 90's because remakes of 50's sci-fi films were then in vogue. The idea I imagine was that those old movies could benefit from the new special effects technology of the time. It has to be said, however, that some of the special effects used in this version of Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman are not much better than those used in the original King Kong sixty years previously. Maybe it's because this is a made for TV production and the budget isn't too high. That's possible certainly but I'm still sure they could've done better. Special effects aside, they could definitely have written the movie better that's for sure. The central idea of a giant woman terrorizing a town is silly and trashy and that's fine, but the problem is that she doesn't get to properly attack anything really. The final showdown effectively amounts to a domestic situation between the 50 Ft. woman and her philandering husband. It's not really the best way to showcase the central character. A little bit more destruction would not have gone amiss. Admittedly the National Guard do show up and battle with the giantess at the end but it's extremely half-hearted at best.Another problem is the way that the supporting cast react to the fact that Daryl Hannah has suddenly grown to a gigantic size. No one really seems very surprised and they all basically carry on acting as if nothing out of the ordinary has happened. A little shock and awe would not have done any harm. It might've helped us have a little empathy with some of the characters. As it was, it was difficult to care too much about anybody, seeing as everyone was so poorly written. Daryl Hannah isn't very good as the lead character but Cristi Conaway is actually not bad as the mistress; maybe she'd have been better in the title role.At the end of the day this is meant to be a cheesy film, so it has to be judged on its cheese value and it does provide some entertainment in a completely throwaway kind of way. It thankfully doesn't take itself at all seriously. At the end of the day the idea of a 50 Ft. woman going on the rampage can only be taken so far so I suppose it's not entirely surprising that this one isn't very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lousy Remake to a Classic Sci-Fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really excited to hear that there was going to be a remake of my favorite movie, but bitterly disappointed when I realized that it would be starring Daryl Hannah in the title role. She's not a very sexy actress nor is she very good-looking by my standards. I've always thought she was a bit on the skinny side. This role needs someone with a certain amount of sex appeal like Markie Post, Emma Samms, Victoria Principal or maybe even the actress playing Honey Parker, Cristi Conaway. I think this movie was just made to show off a new special effect technique, but even then, she still just looks like a normal woman on one of those table top train sets like I used to own. They could have used more of the extreme camera shots like used in Eddie Murphy's godzilla scene in "The Nutty Professor." Much of the movie's script has been updated though and two of the all male roles are now played by actresses [the deputy and one doctor].Some of the lines from the first movie are repeated verbatim, but the attack is still less than a true attack as seen on the original's movie poster. The violence is played down instead of up. The ending, though, is a bigger let down and a far cry from the historical last scene from the original. That strange grinding noise you hear through the movie is actually Allison Hayes rolling over in her grave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie of the century!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can honestly say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot was stupid, the special effects looked ridiculous, and worst of all, every single character was simply annoying. Well, maybe Nancy´s husband wasn´t that bad, at least he was mean to Nancy, who was the most disgusting of all characters. Besides I hated the ending. Maybe this film was supposed to be funny, like the new Blob was, but it was not. It was simply lousy and annoying. Now you might ask that why did I watch the movie at all if it was so terrible, and that´s a very good question. I really have no idea...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Fun as the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman (1993) ** (out of 4) Remake of the 1958 cult classic has Darryl Hannah playing a smart woman who constantly allows herself to be taken advantage of. Her father uses her for her money while her no good husband (Daniel Baldwin) is constantly cheating on her with some trash from their town. After an encounter with a spaceship, the wife grows fifty feet and plans on setting everything straight. This isn't a "so bad it's good" movie like the original. It's not really bad but it's not really good either so in the end I must say that the film comes off as a disappointment because there's so much they could have done with the story but in the end they ended up doing very little. The funny side of the actual story could have made a good comedy but the film really comes off as lazy and not trying to get any laughs. The entire movie seems more interested in trying to develop characters and one has to ask themselves why. Do we really want to see the sad Hannah rise up (not that way) and overcome the tragedy in her life? Do we care that her mom was a nut? Why the filmmakers decided to add this type of thing or the shady deals of her father is beyond me but it really takes away from the sci-fi aspects of the film. The special effects are pretty lazy as well as are the performances. Hannah doesn't do too bad of a job but she certainly can't compare to the original film's star. Baldwin adds very little as the jerk husband. There are a few nods to the original film as well as Arkoff and Corman but the film needed a lot more of this and a lot less of the character development.</fullReview>
